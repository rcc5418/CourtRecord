My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "<span style="color:#E16935">When something smells, it's usually the Butz.</span>" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!

Yes, Your Honor?

As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?

The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.

Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.
</line><line speaker="Payne">
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.
</line><line speaker="Phoenix">
Um, Chief, what do I do now?
</line><line speaker="Mia">
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.)</span>

<line speaker="Payne">
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?

Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!
</line><line speaker="Phoenix">
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Um... didn't they all die?)</span>
</line><line speaker="Butz">
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?
</line><line speaker="Payne">
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!
</line><line speaker="Butz">
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!
</line><line speaker="Payne">
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.
</line><line speaker="<span style="color:#0070C0">Passport added to the Court Record.</span>
</line><line speaker="Judge">
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.
</line><line speaker="Butz">
Dude... no way...
</line><line speaker="Payne">
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."
</line><line speaker="Butz">
Daddies? Sugar?
</line><line speaker="Payne">
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.
</line><line speaker="Butz">
Duuude!
</line><line speaker="Payne">
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, <span style="color:#E16935">what do you think of her now?</span>

Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.

I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.<br />

The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.

Hmm...

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)</span>
</line><line speaker="Judge">
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?
</line><line speaker="Payne">
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.
</line><line speaker="Judge">
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?
</line><line speaker="Payne">
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.
</line><line speaker="<span style="color:#0070C0">Blackout Record added to the Court Record.</span>

Now, Mr. Wright...
</line><line speaker="Phoenix">
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?

You may begin your <span style="color:#E16935">cross-examination</span>.

</line><line speaker="Mia">
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!

Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?
</line><line speaker="Mia">
Why, you expose the <span style="color:#E16935">lies</span> in the testimony the witness just gave!
</line><line speaker="Phoenix">
Lies! What?! He was lying!?
</line><line speaker="Mia">
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?
</line><line speaker="Phoenix">
!!! How do I prove he's not?
</line><line speaker="Mia">
You hold the key! It's in the <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span> in there! First, find contradictions between the <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record</span> and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>... <span style="color:#E16935">present</span> it and rub it in the witness's face!
