Maya:
Umm... Nick?
Phoenix:
What is it?
Maya:
I've got a confession to make... I'm terrible at figuring out magic tricks...
Phoenix:
Magic tricks?
Maya:
Yep. Magic tricks are by their very definition tricks, right? But I can never figure out the tricks when I see them. I'm just not good at it...
Phoenix:
That's because the tricks are performed by pros. They do it so you can't guess the trick.
Maya:
But but... The trick Pearly showed me was incredible!
Phoenix:
Pearls did a magic trick? Hmm... What kind of trick was it?
Maya:
Let's see. It looked like she pulled the end of her own thumb off!
Phoenix:
Heh...
Maya:
First she put her right thumb next to her left hand, and then it just separated! She could move it up and down and everything! It was incredible!
Phoenix:
Really? Was it kinda like this...?
Maya:
WHAT!? WOW! HOW'D YOU DO THAT!? Nick, you're like a real magician! See this is why I just can't figure out magic... I'm no good at it... Especially hard tricks like flying away from the scene of a murder...
Phoenix:
You'll take all the fun out of magic if you keep trying to figure it out.
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.
Maya:
Hey! I'm reading that one! You know I'm studying the law now, right!? I put that bookmark on the page I was reading... Don't you dare move it!
Phoenix:
What!? You're reading!? THESE!? A bookmark, huh... Hmm... You mean this thing? It was only on the second page.
Maya:
Well, you have to start somewhere right?
Phoenix:
You do realize that you have 1000 pages to go right?
Maya:
... Maybe you really should sell all these books, Nick.
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
Charley. A quite decorative plant.
Maya:
Nick, you've been watering the plant everyday, right? I've been thinking about watering it too.
Phoenix:
Maya, we don't want to drown poor Charley.
Maya:
But he'd get bigger!
Phoenix:
(Does she want the office to look like a tropical rain forest or something?)
Desk
Phoenix:
My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...
Maya:
Umm... It's covered with dust. Maybe you should use your desk every now and again.
Movie poster
Phoenix:
A poster of the newest member of the "Steel Samurai" universe.
Maya:
You know about the new "Steel Samurai" movie they are making, don't you Nick?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I heard that they're making a movie starring the new cast.
Maya:
It's already out! Critics say, "Time to commit 'hara-kiri' if you miss this action epic!"
Phoenix:
You don't say...
Maya:
You know, I bet the star will win this year's Hero of Heroes Grand Prix!!
Phoenix:
*yawn* Uh huh...
Maya:
...
Phoenix:
Alright already... I'll go see the movie!!
Maya:
Yay! Let's hurry and wrap this case up so we can see it!
Window
Phoenix:
There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel.
Maya:
Lately they've been holding huge events at the Gatewater. It seems they've really become a top-class hotel. I wonder if that bellboy would remember us?
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
I don't see any way out of this. We're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
Maya:
There's no way we can solve the mystery of a criminal flying by tomorrow... I was thinking... Do you really think the criminal flew through the air? The only one who thinks that is Moe, right? He says that he saw it.
Phoenix:
That's true... Moe looked awfully serious when he said that.
Maya:
Do you think he might be trying to frame Max?
Phoenix:
If that was it, he would have simply said "I saw Max". That would have been enough. There's no reason why anyone would believe "he flew".
Maya:
But... What if the criminal really did fly? There's only one person who could do that... Max.
Phoenix:
(You're really not helping my confidence here, Maya...)
Any ideas
Maya:
Everyone seems to hate Max. Ben, Trilo, Moe... They all have nothing nice to say.
Phoenix:
That magician does seem rather full of himself, doesn't he? Especially when he says things like customers only go to the circus to see him.
Maya:
He even hit Ben over the head with a bottle. But...
Phoenix:
But what?
Maya:
But that doesn't seem enough to frame another person for murder!!
Phoenix:
And it was proven that neither Ben nor Moe lied on the stand.
Maya:
Maybe Ben saw the Ringmaster wearing Max's costume, but Moe clearly said that he saw Max himself.
Present
Crime Photo
Maya:
Oh yeah... The picture of the scene. I wonder what that wooden box is?
Phoenix:
It was probably left at the scene.
Maya:
I can't believe there was only a bottle of pepper in that thing. It must be related to the crime somehow... This is fun, isn't it Nick?
Phoenix:
Not really... It may be fun to solve mysteries, but don't forget this is a murder case.
Maya:
Awww... You're right. I should take things more seriously.
Silk Hat
Maya:
No matter how you look at it, this is definitely Max's silk hat.
Phoenix:
There's even a feather stuck in it.
Maya:
There's something wrong with this hat though.
Phoenix:
Moe's testimony, right? "He left the scene wearing that dumb silk hat!" That's what he said, but the hat was found on the ground at the scene.
Maya:
Hmm... This really is a mystery.
Broken Bottle
Maya:
Whoa. Max used a broken bottle to crack Ben over the head?
Phoenix:
No no no... It broke because Max cracked Ben over the head with it.
Maya:
He must have really hit him hard then... I guess I should give it a try... For research purposes. Come here... I've got a nice bottle right here for you Nick...
Phoenix:
YEOW!!
Maya:
That's weird. It didn't break.
Phoenix:
Of course it didn't!! You hit me with a plastic bottle!!
Ring
Maya:
Can you believe this cost three months of pay? Three months!! Trilo doesn't skimp when it comes to Regina. He's really in love.
Phoenix:
It looks like a real glass stone. Its brilliance is amazing.
Maya:
I bet Money would love to get his hands on this again.
Phoenix:
(I'll have to give this back to Trilo sometime...)
Wooden Box
Maya:
Twenty pounds, huh? That's pretty heavy.
Phoenix:
Especially since the only thing inside was a small bottle of pepper.
Maya:
The more you think about it the more it starts to make your head hurt. But compared to tomorrow this will all be a happy memory.
Phoenix:
Tomorrow!? Don't get ahead of yourself Maya... Let's concentrate on today.
Small Seasoning Bottle
Maya:
You wanna know something Nick? I love to put pepper on my hamburgers. But I also like to put pepper on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Do you think I'm weird?
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
You don't seem to be in a very good mood today.
Phoenix:
Of course I'm not... I have to find a criminal who has discovered the ability to fly.
Maya:
Yeah. I guess that would put you in a bad mood.
Max profile
Maya:
If Moe says that he saw a flying criminal, that means it must have been...
Phoenix:
What's the matter with you!? You know that people can't just up and fly!
Maya:
But Max... He is a magician.
Phoenix:
Without their bag of tricks, magicians are incapable of magic. Besides, what's the likelihood someone set up a flying device at the crime scene? Near zero.
Maya:
What if they set something up so they could trick Moe?
Phoenix:
Umm... Maybe. But I get the feeling that would have been pointless...
Anything else
Phoenix:
What about this?
Maya:
Umm... Yeah... Sorry. I got nothing.
Phoenix:
(She must have been trying to think up a joke or something.)

Max:
Oh! My sweeties!! You mind hurrying up and getting me out of this place!?
Phoenix:
We're doing our best, Max. Just hang in there.
Max:
A little while ago, some people from a local TV station came by... They said that, since I'm a famed magician, "Let's make your very own TV special!"
Maya:
Really? What kind of TV special?
Max:
"Maximillion Galactica: The Great Prison Escape" It would be aired live.
Maya:
Hey! That sounds like it would be an awesome special!
Max:
But if I do the special before I'm acquitted, they'll never let me out of here for real.
Phoenix:
Well, it would surely be an unnecessary addition to your troubles with the law.
Max:
That's what I was thinking... But the production staff is already working on the show! If you don't get me out quick, I'll have no choice but to stage a real prison break.
Phoenix:
You seem awfully calm about that possibility...
Max:
I'd have no choice. It would be a contractual obligation... That's show business.
Talk
Night of the murder
Phoenix:
Umm. The night of the crime... You didn't happen to fly off into the sky, did you?
Max:
Here is how everything went down, sweetie. At the time of the murder, I was sitting in the Ringmaster's room. Not to mention... Flying off into the sky is not just something I can do at will. I don't care what the stoogey clown says, it wasn't me.
Maya:
Max! Max! Do you mind teaching me the trick behind flying?
Max:
Hmm... You'll have to forgive me, sweetie. The difference between me and cheap imitation magicians is that I keep my mouth shut. I don't teach people tricks, but I will say this much. It's much harder than you think.
Today's trial
Maya:
I was thinking about this in court today... I've got a favor to ask of you.
Max:
Anything for you, sweetie.
Maya:
Be friends with the other performers in the circus!
Max:
FABULOUS! A great joke!! Why would I be friends with a bunch of hacks like that?
Maya:
But...!
Max:
I've won on the world stage! I won the International Grand Prix!
Phoenix:
International Grand Prix?
Max:
Performers should always look to perform on the world stage! But the performers at this circus are completely and utterly devoid of ambition! That is something that I can simply not tolerate!
Phoenix:
(Ambition, huh...?)
Maya:
Something about what Max just said rings true to my ears...
Grand Prix (appears after Today's trial)
Max:
Oh my! My sweeties want to hear all about the Grand Prix, don't they? To be honest though, I've told this story like 100 times already, so it's a bit boring.
Phoenix:
We're sorry to make you tell it again.
Max:
You must not have heard me... I am really sick of telling this story. But what can you do? I'm Maximillion Galactica. I suppose I can tell it again. ... Voila! Here, take a look at this! I just happen to have a picture from the Grand Prix with me. Just look at that fabulous stage!! That is the first stage that I ever flew on. I flew right over the audience! The crowd erupted into applause! At that time, I thought to myself that I could die right then and die a happy man. I'll never forget how I felt that night. The emotions... The acclaim...
Maya:
Wow.
Max:
*ahem* By the way... I think everyone who is a performer should get to experience that feeling. I just wish I could explain that to the other people in the circus!
Maya:
That's incredible Max... I want a trophy too! Hey Nick! How about you buy me a trophy!?
Phoenix:
That's not how you earn a trophy Maya!
Max:
My sweeties, you can have this picture of my triumph... Just make sure you show it to all the other members of the circus. "Watch and learn!" That's what you should tell them.
Phoenix:
(Learn how to get thrown in jail?)
Grand Prix Photo added to the Court Record.
Present
Silk Hat
Max:
This is definitely my silk hat. I don't suppose I'm allowed to wear it anymore am I?
Phoenix:
Max, this one of your uppi... I mean, excellent symbols, right?
Max:
That's right. Honestly though, I only like it because of the feather in the brim.
Broken Bottle
Maya:
Max! How could you!? How could you hit poor Ben over the head with this!?
Max:
I've been thinking about that lately... But he did call me a "no-good talentless hack of a fast food magician"...
Maya:
You mean Trilo said that? Not Ben, right?
Max:
There is no Trilo or Ben. There is only one Benjamin Woodman.
Maya:
Hmm... I guess you're right.
Grand Prix Photo
Max:
I'm normally fabulous, but in this picture, I'm the king of the world! I even got a fabulous trophy and a super fabulous bust.
Maya:
That's really cool! I wouldn't mind seeing your trophy some day.
Max:
If you want to see one of my awards, you should just go to the cafeteria.
Maya:
The cafeteria? You mean the one inside the circus tent?
Max:
Of course. The trophy isn't there, but the bust that I won is!
Maya:
It's in the cafeteria? We were just there yesterday. Nick, did you see a bust anywhere inside the cafeteria?

Maya:
You hear that? It sounds like two people arguing...
Trilo:
Alright, let's do it. Are you ready?
Ben:
Y-Yes... A-Ah... Wait...
Trilo:
Quit your whining! Let's just give this a shot already! Alright! Let's go!
Ben:
Row-row-row-your-boat!
Trilo:
Row-row-row-your-boat!
Ben:
...
Trilo:
What are you doing!? Gently-down-the-stream! C'mon, you know that!!
Ben:
I'm trying my best, but... Trilo, this just isn't going to work...
Trilo:
Do you enjoy saying dumb things? You're going to have to be on your own someday! If you can't handle something as simple as this, was are you going to do then!?
Maya:
Hello Ben. Hello to you too, Trilo.
Trilo:
What are you doing here!? Can't you see we're on a secret crash training course!?
Maya:
I'm sorry...
Phoenix:
Secret crash training! Whoa.
Ben:
Yes. Trilo wouldn't give up until I said we'd try out his idea for a new routine. So... We were trying to sing in a round for our new ventriloquism act.
Maya:
In a round!? You can really do that!? That's incredible!
Trilo:
See! See! Even they are surprised by the idea!! I told you!!
Ben:
They're not the only ones!! You even surprised me with your idea!!
Trilo:
Once we've got a grip on the basics, then it's just a matter of practice!
Ben:
Y-Y-You t-t-think so?
Maya:
Oh, I almost forgot! I wanted to give this back to you.
Trilo:
Ahh! There it is!! Now that I've got this ring back, it's time to take one more shot at Regina!
Examine
Door
Maya:
The murder took place right over there..
Phoenix:
You never really get used to the feeling of being where someone's life was taken.
Maya:
I know... The Ringmaster seems like he was such a good man. It * ([sic]) so sad... For everyone.
Talk
Today's trial
Maya:
Umm... I know that you already testified in court today...
Trilo:
You want to talk about what we saw, right?
Maya:
Yes.
Trilo:
Well, at first we thought it was the old man... Just looking at his walk and how he acted. Right Ben?
Ben:
Huh!? Oh, oh yeah. That's right.
Trilo:
But then we said hello and didn't even get a reply. Not to mention he was draped in those gaudy symbols.
Maya:
What would you have thought if he wasn't wearing those symbols?
Trilo:
Hmm... What do you think Ben?
Ben:
What!? Oh... Umm... I would have thought it was the Ringmaster.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Something just isn't adding up here. I wonder who they really saw?)
Marriage
Maya:
I was hoping I could ask you about Regina...
Trilo:
I'm completely serious about her! That's why I'm waiting for her even now!
Maya:
Really? That's so sweet... But if you really wanted to see Regina, shouldn't you check out the tent?
Trilo:
Hah! You haven't got a clue about things, do you sweetheart?
Maya:
Eh?
Trilo:
Waiting like this is part of being in love.
Maya:
How so?
Trilo:
If you had a clue, you would know that waiting is such sweet, wonderful torture. When your body aches for your partner's love... That's one of the best parts!!
Maya:
Umm... Y-Yeah... I-I knew that...
Phoenix:
(Poor Maya... She's so red she looks like a vine ripe tomato!)
Ventriloquism
Maya:
So how is this new routine working out?
Trilo:
Will you two just take a chill pill already!? Our routines are secret!! We're going to take the ventriloquism world by storm! It'll be a real revolution!
Maya:
That sounds incredible!
Trilo:
But let me make one thing clear... We're not going to take on the world just because that stupid jerk said we should...
Phoenix: 
That jerk?
Trilo:
Max Galactica. "Performers should aim for the world!" Who does he think he is!?
Maya:
Trilo, you seem to really be fired up about all this!!
Trilo:
He needs to realize that he isn't the only one who can conquer the world stage!
Maya:
You're right! You're right!
Trilo:
Mark my words... I, Trilo Quist, will win the Grand Prix!!
Maya:
You're the man now, doll!
Trilo:
"Row-row-row-your-boat!" will be the key to a glorious victory!!
Phoenix:
Umm... Not to rain on your parade, but wouldn't a more mature song be best?
Trilo:
Hey... You've got to start somewhere right?
Ben:
...
Trilo:
Don't screw this up! You've gotta be a part of this too.

Anything
Maya:
Would you mind taking a look at this?
Ben:
Um... Umm... Uh... I-I-I-I... Umm... That... U-U-U-Uhh... I-I-I-I-It's...
Maya:
... I guess we won't need you to look at this after all.

Gumshoe:
Oh, it's you two.
Phoenix:
You look like you just got hit by a truck. Shouldn't you get some rest?
Gumshoe:
Nah... I'm taking a rest right now, pal. I've been listening to come crazy clown's life story. Ms. von Karma told me to come down here and do this for her.
Phoenix:
Being bossed around by a woman... I know how you feel.
Gumshoe:
Let me tell you something, pal. Listening to that old clown sucks all your energy. Every time he's done talkin' he looks at you like you should be doing something...
Phoenix:
Umm... I think he's waiting for you to laugh at his jokes.
Gumshoe:
I know that, pal. Do you have any idea how much your face hurts if you fake laughing that much?
Maya:
Franziska really set you up bad this time, didn't she? If you ask me, she should be listening to Moe herself...
Gumshoe:
No way, pal. You're not gonna get me to backbite a woman with a whip. No way.
Maya:
Why are you defending her?
Gumshoe:
Prosecutor von Karma's always got her eyes on us. And every time you definitely don't want her to show up... *poof* There she is!! Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up... Don't show up...
Phoenix:
(Looks like she's wound him pretty tight...)
Gumshoe:
She's directly above us as we speak.
Maya:
Huh? How's that possible?
Gumshoe:
According to the clown, the criminal jumped from here and disappeared into the sky. If that's what happened, it means the killer passed right by this window, pal.
Maya:
Oh, I see... Who lives in that room behind the window up there?
Gumshoe:
The acrobat's got his room up on the third floor, it seems. Pretty soon, Ms. von Karma's gonna start her investigation up there. So don't get any ideas of going up to the acrobat's room, got it pal?
Maya:
*shivers* V-Von Karma...
Phoenix:

Maya:
If he was here, you would have been able to tell even before you stepped into his room. I'm sure you would've heard him laughing away... "Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!"
Phoenix:
What do you think he is laughing at when he's all by himself?
Maya:
I always thought he was just thinking up new jokes.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... He must really love his work...)
Examine
Pajamas
Phoenix:
Moe's got an excellent pair of pajamas... Laid on his bed in an excellent manner.
Maya:
They're not actually pajamas. They're actually costumes. Uh huh... I guess you could say that they're professional sleepwear.
Shoes
Maya:
You've really gotta give it to Moe... Slipping on a banana 100 times a day. That's incredible. Maybe I should try giving it a shot myself. I guess I'll start out by juggling.
Phoenix:
(Maybe you should start with spirit channeling... Just a thought...)
Window
Maya:
This is where Moe witnessed the crime.
Phoenix:
Well this is where Moe witnessed some craziness... (I mean, c'mon... A flying criminal... Jeez... If we had a normal judge, he'd never believe something like that...)
Window
Maya:
These carrots like like they are the pick of the crop, don't they?
Phoenix:
I still don't get why he went with carrots...
Maya:
Hmm... What do you think about this theory? A long time ago, the circus was down on its luck. Moe was so hungry that he had to steal the horses food to survive. But he got addicted to their orangey goodness... Ha ha ha ha ha. 
Phoenix:
(I'd laugh, but I think Maya might not be too far from the truth.)
Clown equipment
Maya:
Tee hee... Clown equipment is so funny looking!
Phoenix:
He's got a balancing ball, a unicycle... He's even got a trampoline!! ... But they're all broken.
Maya:
Well, you've got to give them all a shot. Trying is the most important thing!!
Phoenix:
(He sure seems to have tried them all... But were any of them useful?)

Alright! You know what time it is!! Riddle time!! Why does everyone cry when they eat Mexican pizza?
Phoenix:
Umm...
Moe:
C'mon! You can answer this! It's easy!!
Phoenix:
...Because cafeteria Mexican pizza is possibly a weapon of bowel destruction?
Moe:
*BUZZ* Wrong! Try again! OK! What do you think, girlie?
Maya:
Umm... Ahh! I got it!!
Moe:
OK!! What is your answer?
Maya:
Because they are in the Café Teary Eye!
Moe:
Exactly!! It's an incredibly sad place, that café. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
Maya:
I did it!!

Phoenix:
The kitchen is over here.
Moe:
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! I wrote a new joke about the kitchen... Let's see... How did that joke go... Umm...
Phoenix:
(Lemme guess... "What did the chef say to the chicken before dinner? Knife to meet ya!" It's gotta be something dumb like that...)
Moe:
What did the chef say to the chicken before dinner? Knife to meet ya!
Maya:
That's a great one Moe. I would have never thought of that.
Notice
Maya:
"Keep Our Cafeteria Clean!"
Moe:
Take a good look at that sign girlie.
Maya:
Huh? It says... "Keep Our Cafeteria Clean!?"
Moe:
I added a question mark on there... I'm thinking that might be why the cafeteria is so dirty.
Back table
Phoenix:
There are dirty dishes all over the place... It must have been too hectic that night to clean up.
Maya:
You know I can't stand a mess Nick! I think you and I should clean this place up for them!
Moe:
Yay! You two are going to help us restore order to this cafeteria!?
Phoenix:
What are you talking about? You're gonna help too!
Moe:
Clowns can't clean!! We're here to throw pies, not clean them up! I'm a bust-a-gut boy, not a bus boy! Get it... It was two jokes in one! I'm fat and funny! Get it!? Aha! Aha! Aha!
Phoenix:
Yes. Moe. We got it.
Maya:
Uhhh...
Dining tables
Phoenix:
It looks like they've left it exactly as it was on the night of the murder.
Moe:
I was in charge of the cooking that day. It was going to be a special menu.
Maya:
Really? What were you going to cook?
Moe:
Moe Moo Burgers.
Phoenix:
What are those?
Moe:
A beefy burger filled with laughs and a sauce that tastes like my jokes. They're outstanding.
Phoenix:
(So those burgers leave just as bad of a taste in your mouth as his jokes then.)
Knocked over chairs
Phoenix:
The chair's been knocked over.
Maya:
That's what it looks like.
Moe:
Looking at all this brings back lots of memories.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Moe:
I proposed here... To a girl on horseback. Of course, I was much younger back then.
Maya:
So what happened? What was her answer?
Moe:
Well... Let's just say that my love was put out to pasture.
Talk
Today's trial
Maya:
Today's been a really crazy day, hasn't it?
Moe:
You're telling me! I didn't think it was going to be so tough.
Maya:
Tough?
Moe:
Yeah. It was a tough crowd. That's what you call a crowd that refuses to laugh. For instance, it was such a tough crowd last night I had to smash watermelons.
Maya:
Hmm...
Moe:
I told them all a great story and even greater jokes, but no one busted out laughing...
Maya:
You even used the famed "No shoes, no shirt, no service" joke!
Moe:
Exactly! How can you not laugh at stunning comedy like that!?
What you witnessed
Phoenix:
Are you 100% sure about your testimony today?
Moe:
I saw that I saw! I swear! That creep just...
Maya:
Flew through the air?
Moe:
It wasn't exactly flying per say... It was more like floating. The silhouette of his face made me positive it was Max!
Phoenix:
(I don't see a Psyche-Lock... He must be telling the truth.)
Max's Bust (appears after presenting Grand Prix Photo)
Moe:
Max's bust should be on that small table over there.
Phoenix:
There's nothing over there.
Moe:
Really? ... Oh yeah. Hmm... When was it...? I'd say about five days ago, all of a sudden... The bust disappeared.
Maya:
It disappeared?
Moe:
If you want to see it, there's a photo on the bulletin board over there. Max just had to put the picture up.
Maya:
Hmm... Hey! This thing is really cool! Nick! Nick! I want someone to make a bust of me!
Phoenix:
Sure, as long as I'm not paying for it.
Maya:
Aww...
Max G. Bust added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Is there anything else that's changed about this place?
Moe:
Nope. Nothing's changed that I can see...
Phoenix:
(I wonder if he's actually thinking about this, or if he is setting up for a bad joke?)
Moe:
Nope nope... I'm drawing a blank here.
Phoenix:
(A quiet Moe is a good Moe in my book.)
Maya:
I guess there really aren't any other things that have changed, huh?
Moe:
Well... There is this one tinsy tiny thing that does seem different.
Phoenix:
Tell us! Tell us!
What changed (appears after Max's Bust)
Moe:
Well... On the morning of the crime, over on that bulletin board... This piece of paper was posted front and center.
Phoenix:
Piece of paper?
Moe:
It's torn, so I don't know what it said, but I could see it's* ([sic]) title.
Maya:
Yikes! It says, "To The Murderer!!"
Phoenix:
M-M-M-Murderer!?
Moell
Yup, that's what it says. But the rest of it has been ripped off. And I don't know who posted it.
Phoenix:
Umm... When did you find this?
Moe:
The morning before the murder.
Maya:
Before the murder!?
Moe:
Yes. The Ringmaster was killed the night after this paper was discovered.
Phoenix:
(Who in the world posted this thing...?)
Note added to the Court Record.
Maya:
Nick! I think this is a very important clue!

Moe:
I can't stand Max and his attitude sometimes!
Maya:
I know...
Moe:
But lately...
Maya:
Huh?
Moe:
It's just... Lately I've started to understand what he is always going on about.
Maya:
What is is then?
Moe:
Well... Umm... I'm not sure if I can explain it all that well just yet...
Phoenix:
(Just when you think it's impossible, Moe flashes a glimpse of maturity...)
Grand Prix Photo
Moe:
Ahh! Not this picture!! He showed it to you guys too?
Maya:
Huh? You've seen it as well?
Moe:
Well, you know what they say about Maximillion Galactica... He really gets around. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
Maya:
Hehe.
Moe:
Oh yeah... He didn't just show me the picture!
Maya:
What do you mean?
Moe:
He showed me his bust too. Let me tell you, that this is enormous! It's in the picture, I think. He'd make us worship it... Everyday. He made us bow to his greatness.
Phoenix:
(He's got a... Big... Bust? I wouldn't mind hearing more about Max's bust... Not that I'm into that sorta thing...)
Note
Moe:
The morning of the murder, this was posted up on the bulletin board. That's when Max clonked Ben over the head. Sorry I hadn't remembered it until now. It was torn down before anyone really paid any attention to it.
Phoenix:
So you don't know what was written on it, do you?
Moe:
Unfortunately I don't. But I betcha they would know!
Phoenix:
Who are "they"?
Moe:
Max and Ben. They were at the cafeteria earlier than I was that morning.
Anything else
Moe:
Sorry, but I don't know anything about that.
Maya:
I see...
Moe:
After all, I'm just a clown.
Phoenix:

Note
Maya:
Do you know anything about this note?
Phoenix:
The morning of the murder, it was posted on the wall in the cafeteria...
Max:
I do know all about that note. When I read it, my heart certainly skipped a beat.
Maya:
Your heart skipped a beat?
Max:
While I was enjoying my morning tea, the Ringmaster and company entered the room.
Phoenix:
And company...?
Max:
I guess it wasn't really a company... It was just the Ringmaster and my sweetie pie. When the Ringmaster read the note, he turned an incredible bright red. All of a sudden he tore it off the wall and shoved it into the pocket of his tailcoat!
Maya:
Really!? Out of curiosity, what in the world was written on that thing?
Max:
... Let's see...
Maya:
Uh-huh...
Max:
Oh I don't want to steal the fun from my sweeties! Go and find out on your own! I'm sure you can find it somewhere. You might also want to ask my sweetie pie princess.

Tailcoat
Maya:
Hey, do you see that? There's a scrap of paper shoved into the pocket of the tailcoat.
Phoenix:
You know... I've got a feeling I know what that is...
Maya:
I bet that's the other half of the note that Moe gave us. Then let's hurry up and check this thing out, Nick! I knew it! It fits perfectly with the other piece.
Phoenix:
What does it say? What does it say? "To The Murderer! I have conclusive evidence of what took place. Meet at 10:00 PM tonight at the lodging house plaza."
Maya:
Tonight at 10:00 PM?
Phoenix:
That's when the murder took place!
Maya:
Now we need to find out who called out the Ringmaster!!
Note updated in the Court Record.
Tailcoat (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
The Ringmaster's tailcoat.
Maya:
It's been expertly cleaned and pressed. It's got one perfect crease.
Phoenix:
The Ringmaster must have liked things neat and tidy.
Maya:
This is kinda pointless isn't it? There's no way this beats Moe's room. Now that's cool!

Well, I am done with the investigation of the acrobat. Finally. But with Ms. von Karma...

...*beep* *beep*...
...*beep* *beep*...
Maya:
Nick, what is that? That beeping sound?
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Gumshoe:
It's Ms. von Karma.
Maya:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
Every time I hear that sound, she's usually not very far behind!
Phoenix:
Some sort of pager or something?
Gumshoe:
If you don't mind pal, I'm gonna go ahead and get outta here... Quick. See ya, pal!!

I didn't know that Gumshoe could run that fast! So much for being a flatfoot.

von Karma:
It was a battle today in court, wasn't it... Mr. Phoenix Wright!?
Phoenix:
Did you have to jump out and scare us like that? What can I do for you?
von Karma:
Tomorrow will be the day. The day my dream finally comes true!
Phoenix:
You mean the story of my defeat at your hands making the national news?
von Karma:
Ha ha ha... National news? You possess such a small sense of scale... The global news, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Your miserable plight will be known internationally!
Phoenix:
(I think she might be overestimating the importance of a win by just a smudge...)
Talk
Tomorrow's trial
Phoenix:
Von Karma... It appears you got your hands onto something, eh?
von Karma:
Hah! I'm amazed you picked up on that much.
Phoenix:
(Anyone could. You couldn't hide that look of victory with ten paper bags on your head!)
von Karma:
I've got "conclusive evidence" and a "conclusive witness"... Need any more hints?
Phoenix:
"A conclusive witness"... You must mean the acrobat, right?
von Karma:
I'm putting in the summons for him to be called as a witness as we speak. It's the final nail in your coffin, Mr. Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it already, you want to beat and destroy me. I can't worry about her. I've got to try and find out more information myself.)
"Revenge"
Maya:
Why do you keep giving Nick the evil eye!? It doesn't matter if you prove the defendant guilty tomorrow... Nothing will be able to bring your dad back!
von Karma:
... My... Dad? You must mean the esteemed Manfred von Karma.
Maya:
Of course! Your dad! I know you miss him...
von Karma:
Enough out of you... One more word and you'll get a mouthful of whip. Now. When did I ever bring up my papa's name in this, or any other conversation...?
Phoenix:!! Then... Then what's this "revenge" thing you're talking about?
von Karma:
You wouldn't understand, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I have to see "him" again, one more time.
Phoenix:
"Him"?
von Karma:
I'm sure you know to whom I refer... Miles Edgeworth!!
Maya:
What!? Edgeworth!? Mr... EDGEWORTH!?
Phoenix:
M-M-Mi-Miles E-Ed-Edg-Edgeworth!!
Miles Edgeworth (appears after "Revenge")
Phoenix: 
Miles Edgeworth... Why would you even bring him up!?
von Karma:
You haven't forgotten, have you? Do you know who it was that trained the gifted prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth?
Maya:!! Manfred... von... Karma...
von Karma:
Exactly right. It was my papa.
Maya:
That means that Edgeworth was...
von Karma:
Right again. Miles was like a little brother to me.
Maya:
Huh? Little brother? Edgeworth and Nick are the same age...
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... The man who inspired me to become an attorney. I fought against him in a few cases... But after "that" case was over... He "vanished"...)
von Karma:
It's your fault he is gone.
Maya:
HUH!?
von Karma:
It's the truth, isn't it Mr. Phoenix Wright?
Phoenix:
I... I...
Maya:
Nick! What does she mean!?
Edgeworth's death (appears after Miles Edgeworth)
Phoenix: 
After that case, Edgeworth was in a peculiar state, and he got worse everyday. He never set foot into court again... And then one day, he just vanished. All he left was a simple note at the prosecutor's office.
von Karma:
"Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth chooses death."
Phoenix:
That was one year ago. It was right after you left to go back home.
Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth... He's dead?
von Karma:
I don't believe it. He's still alive. I'm sure of it... Somewhere in this world, he's still alive. "Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth chooses death?" Of course he did! You ruined his reputation as a Prosecutor! You effectively killed the Prosecutor in him. Just like your victory muddied the honorable name Von Karma! I'm going to find him... Then I'm going to teach him the difference between right and wrong with my own hands!

von Karma:

Hmph. This dog is all bark and no bite. He's already been defeated... Regardless, I have nothing to inform you two of today. Tomorrow will be the greatest courtroom battle this country has ever seen!!

Pleased to meet you. I'm Ken Dingling.
Acro:
But here at the circus, everyone just calls me Acro.
Maya:
Mr... Acro.
Phoenix:
Ummm... How do you know my name?
Acro:
The detective told me. He said you'd definitely show up here.
Maya:
Acro, you're a member of this circus as well?
Acro:
That's right. I mainly perform on the tightrope or the flying trapeze. But nowadays... All I perform in is my wheelchair.
Examine
Junk pile
Maya:
Eww... It's a huge pile of trash!
Phoenix:
One man's trash is another monkey's treasure.
Maya:
I guess you're right. Look! They're all shiny things.
Phoenix:
He's even got a motorcycle exhaust. What do they call this thing? Oh... A tuba right?
Maya:
Of course it's a tuba, silly! You didn't know that!?
Phoenix:
Hey... It's a picture of Regina.
Maya:
Well, she is a shining beauty.
Phoenix:
No objections here.

Maya:
Hehe... It's a monkey calendar!
Phoenix:
Acro must really love monkeys.
Talk
Berry Big Circus
Phoenix:
Acro, why did you join the circus?
Acro:
When I was a kid, my parents failed miserably at business. Then one night, they decided to run away from it all... Without me.
Maya:
...!!
Acro:
The only person who was willing to take my parent's* ([sic]) place was the Ringmaster. The Ringmaster took such incredible care of me. He was truly a lifesaver.
Maya:
It seems like the Ringmaster was truly a saint.
Acro:
He was... That's why I decided to do something very important. I decided that I would devote my entire life to finding a way to repay him... And now... Look how someone repaid him for all the good in his life!!
Phoenix:
It's such a shame.
Acro:
Sometimes I think that he was almost too kind... Perhaps he was too kind to his performers... Perhaps he was too kind to his daughter.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I wonder if he spoiled Regina?)
Maya:
Regina is so cute!! She's truly a princess.
Acro:
Truly a princess? Are you sure that's a good thing?
Maya:
Umm...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Do I detect a hint of a grudge against Regina...)
Wheelchair
Maya:
Umm... I'm sorry to ask, but why are you in a wheel chair?
Acro:
The nerves in my legs were badly damaged.
Phoenix:
And you can't walk now?
Acro:
I can't even stand now. And since I live on the third floor, I can't even leave this building by myself.
Maya:
That's awful...
Phoenix:
The accident happened during an acrobatics session, right?
Acro:
Umm...
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
(A Psyche-Lock! It doesn't seem like Acro's injuries were acrobatic in nature...)
Acro:
What's on your mind, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Well... Exactly when were you injured?
Acro:
It's almost been six months since I was hurt. I injured my legs during practice.
Phoenix:
(Six months ago... What in the world went on at this circus then!?)
Wheelchair (after Psyche-Locks appear)
Acro:
I'm still undergoing rehabilitation for my injuries. I still can't stand, but the doctor's* ([sic]) say that I'll be able to recover and walk again.
Maya:
Out of curiosity, what kind of accident was it again?
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Acro:
I don't really have much more to add beyond that.
Phoenix:
(Acro's hiding what really caused his "accident". Maybe it's related to what happened to the Ringmaster?)
What happened
Phoenix:
I stopped by yesterday and noticed that you weren't in your room.
Acro:
I was at the hospital all day yesterday.
Phoenix:
Ahh... You went there for rehabilitation? What about the murder?
Acro:
Of course I knew about it... I spoke with the police before they allowed me to go to the hospital. Before I got the call from the prosecutor, I was convinced that it was all a dream.
Maya:
Huh?
Acro:
I just couldn't believe it. When I saw what I saw...
Phoenix:
"What you saw"...? (Jeez, that sounded really ominous...)
What you witnessed (appears after What happened)
Phoenix:
What did you see, Acro?
Acro:
That night... I was in bed sleeping when I heard a huge sound coming from below my window.
Maya:
I see... The scene of the crime was right below your window.
Acro:
That's when I looked out the window...
Maya:
What did you see?
Acro:
He was flying straight up into the air...
Phoenix:
H-He?
Acro:
Maximillion Galactica.
Maya:
Whaaatttt!?
Phoenix:
(That's what I thought he'd say...) Your absolutely positive that it was Max you saw flying?
Acro:
I am absolutely sure. There's no doubt in my mind.
Maya:
N-Nick...

Acro:
If my legs weren't like this... I would have been able to prevent this from happening! That's an absolute certainty!
Maya:
Acro...
Silk Hat, Ringmaster's Papers, Max G. Promo Poster, Grand Prix Photo, or Max G. Bust
Acro:
Maximillion Galactica, right? You'll have to forgive me, but I try not to think about him.
Phoenix:

Maya:
It looks like something is really weighing on him.
Money the Monkey
Acro:
Heh... Money is a great friend to me.
Phoenix:
That pile of "treasure" over there is his collection, huh?
Acro:
It is indeed. Money will bring anything back with him.
Maya:
Aww... That's so cute!
Acro:
Yeah, I'm not great with the ladies... But I seem to be pretty popular with the animals.
Note
Acro:
Hmm... What's this?
Phoenix:
That's what we want to know.
Maya:
It was posted in the cafeteria the morning before the murder.
Acro:
In the... Cafeteria?
Phoenix:
(W-What happened? He suddenly looks incredibly serious...)
Acro:
... If it's got something to do with her, then you should go straight to the source.
Maya:
Her?
Acro:
Regina. Ask her about it.
Max profile
Acro:
You want to know about Max? Well, his colleagues in the circus all seem to hate him.
Phoenix:
What about you, Acro?
Acro:
I've got my issues with him as well. But he just also happens to have a diamond shining in his soul.
Maya:
A diamond shining in his soul?
Acro:
I guess you could say it is his pride as a performer. We didn't have that pride in ourselves before Max arrived. Honestly, I think he brought something wonderful to this circus when he came.
Maya:
Acro...
Phoenix:
(This guy is really different from the other members of the circus...)
Ben profile
Phoenix:
I was hoping you could shed some light on Ben...
Acro:
Well, he'll always be here. And as long as he's here, he really can only continue to be a ventriloquist. Whether that's a good thing for him or not... I'm afraid I can't really say.
Franziska von Karma profile
Acro:
Mr. Wright. I just realized who you remind me of... You're just like this prosecutor.
Phoenix:
W-W-W-W-WHAT!?
Acro:
You and the prosecutor have the same glint in your eyes.
Phoenix:
Y-You're joking, right!? You think I'm like that whip carrying demon!?
Acro:
Whoa... No need to get so hostile about it. You two may view things from very different perspectives... for now. But you both see the world through the same color-tinted glasses. I know because when I look at people, their eyes are the only things I can believe in.
Maya:
Hmm... Nick and Von Karma, huh...
Regina Berry profile
Acro:
Regina...
Maya:
She's cool, isn't she? And can you believe such a cute girl is an animal tamer!?
Acro:
It seems animals are not the only thing* ([sic]) she tames.
Maya:
Huh?
Acro:
Max, the Ringmaster, Ben... She's got them all under her thumb.
Maya:
W-Whaddya mean by that?
Acro:
Hmm... Maybe I went a bit overboard. It's just Regina's innocence. She was incredibly sheltered as a child.
Maya:
I'd say it seems that way.
Acro:
That's why she can be so cruel.
Maya:
What?
Acro:
Regina is just like the animals she claims to tame. She's innocent, thus she can be cruel.
Phoenix:
(I wonder what happened between Acro and Regina...)
Russell Berry profile
Acro:
The Ringmaster... He was even more than a father to me. When he took me in, the circus was in bad shape. It was obvious that he had no real way of supporting us.
Phoenix:
(Who does he mean by us...?)
Maya:
Is that why you started with acrobatics?
Acro:
Back then, I was only nine years old. I begged the Ringmaster to let me try, and he finally gave in. Having a kid in the circus was probably the last thing in the world that he wanted... I just wanted to be helpful. So I could help the Ringmaster.
Maya:
That's such a nice story.
Moe profile
Acro:
The Ringmaster really believed in Moe. One-hundred percent. What will happen to the circus now that the Ringmaster's gone...? The beginning of the Lawrence Curls era I suppose.
Phoenix:
(I wonder if it's really alright to let Moe run the show...)
Acro:
Mr. Wright, you don't know much about Moe, I suspect.
Phoenix:
You can see right through me.
Maya:
Aww Nick! You can't let him get to you like that! You're an attorney!
Acro profile
Acro:
I can't believe what happened to the Ringmaster... Such a wonderful man... What a pity. I have no clue what to do with my life now.
Maya:
I'm sorry...
Acro:
This circus meant everything to me. But don't worry about me... There are still things that I have left to do in this world.
Any other evidence
Maya:
What do you think of this!?
Acro:
I'm sorry, but in my present physical condition... I don't really know much about what goes on outside of this room.
Maya:
Oh... We're sorry...
Acro:
Don't worry about it. No need to apologize.

Russell Berry
Maya:
It's a pity about what happened to the Ringmaster.
Regina:
Dad?
Maya:
Everyone loved him, didn't they? He must have been quite a man.
Regina:
He was!! I love my dad sooo much!
Phoenix:
(I hate to say it, but she doesn't seem all that broken up about her father...)
Regina:
That's why I feel so lonely. Now that I won't be able to see him for a while...
Maya:
For a while?
Regina:
Yeah. When Léon died, I talked with my dad, and he told me that... "When someone dies, they just become a star in the heavens."
Maya:
A s-star?
Regina:
That means that my dad is looking down on me from the sky. That's why I love the night so much. I can see everyone who's gone.
Phoenix:
("When someone dies, they just become a star in the heavens." That's kinda sweet... But I bet you there's no way that Maya believes that...)
Maya:
What do you mean "there's no way I believe that"!?
Regina:
Do you think that one day... I'll be a star too?
Maya:
Of course!
Regina:
You really think so?

Yeah... You will. I think...

Money the Monkey

Just to go back up and clear something up... Why'd you want to teach Money a lesson?
Regina:
Because he's a meanie! He's got something that means a lot to me...
Maya:
Something that means a lot to you? It must be something shiny right?
Regina:
Umm... Actually... It's a stage costume. It's got lots of spangles... It's really beautiful, you should see it.
Maya:
What are spangles?
Regina:
When the costume gets hit by the spotlight, it dazzles. Hey Mr. Attorney!
Phoenix:
Huh?

If you saw that monkey, you'd get my dress back for me, wouldn't you? It's really important to me...

It's not dangerous at all. Regent's just a little kitten!

That's when you realized the piece of paper was in your pocket?
Regina:
Yep. But since I'm not a murderer, I just figured it belonged in someone else's pocket.
Phoenix:
And then what...?
Regina:
I wondered if the person who lost it was in trouble, so...
Maya:
You didn't put it on the bulletin board in the cafeteria, did you?
Regina:
I did! I stuck it up there. How'd you know...?
Phoenix:
Hmm... (So it was Regina who put it up there!) When did this happen?
Regina:
Umm... The morning of the murder. I think.
Phoenix:
(That explains a lot...)
Regina:
I wonder who wrote this...

Hey Maya, do you know if Max is doing OK?
Maya:
Well... Umm... I don't think I'd go so far as to say he was OK...
Regina:
Aww... I hope he comes back here real soon.
Maya:
I'm sure he's going to come back here... Right, Nick?
Regina:
There's no way he will lose with you helping him... Right, Mr. Attorney?
Phoenix:
Umm... *gulp* Of course. If I'm Wright, you're right!!
Russell Berry profile
Regina:
I might not be able to see my Dad for a while, but... I know I can wait until I see him again.

Regina:
Don't do that Maya. Please don't look at me that way.
Maya:
I-I'm s-s-sorry.
Phoenix:

Moe profile
Regina:
He's been a good friend to my dad for a really long time now. My dad always said... "When it comes to who I can entrust the circus to, it's definitely Moe."
Maya:
Hmm... Yep! That clown is one lovable stooge. Don't you think so, Nick?
Phoenix:
Umm... No comment...
Acro profile
Regina:
Ahh, it's Acro. Is he in his room today?
Phoenix:
Yes, he is. We just came back from meeting with him.
Regina:
I hope his legs get better soon. Acro's so incredible! Especially on the trapeze!
Maya:
The trapeze is that enormous swing hanging from the top of the tent, right?
Regina:
Yep, that's it! I really want to see him up there again... Acro the Acrobat.
Phoenix:
(That's strange... Acro doesn't seem to have very many nice things to say about Regina... But Regina seems to like Acro just fine.)

Berry Big Circus
Maya:
Now that the Ringmaster is gone, what are you going to do?
Moe:
That's all I've thought about the past two days... Everyone loved Russell... You've heard Acro's story haven't you?
Phoenix:
Like how he was adopted when he was younger?
Moe:
He's calmed down a bit now, but when the murder happened he was livid. Acro was so upset that he said he couldn't go on.
Phoenix:
He was that upset?
Moe:
Yes he was... Anyways, I gave it some thought. Maybe I should give up on trying to be a half-baked clown... I've been thinking of trying on the Ringmaster's shoes...
Maya:
What!? Really!?
Moe:
Max would still be an issue though...
Maya:
Max?
Moe:
He may be a bit mean and hard to work with, but it's hard to argue his importance. He's probably the reason the circus is still around... A lot of what he says is right.
Maya:
Moe...
Moe:
All that's left is to see if everyone would get over the tragedy... You know...
Phoenix:
(The tragedy? You know? What is he talking about?)
"Get over it"?
Phoenix:
"Get over" what tragedy, Moe?
Moe:
Huh!? Don't worry about it... It's nothing. Nothing at all.
Maya:
He must mean the tragic death of the Ringmaster, right?
Moe:
Yes Yes! That's it! You're right, girlie! Dang! Dang! Dang! Correct-o-mundo!!
Phoenix:
(Doesn't he mean "ding"?) Moe... I mean no disrespect here, but... Are you lying to us?
Moe:
Egghhh... No! Not at all! What makes you think that!?
Phoenix:
Just the way you said "if everyone would get over it" seemed a bit strange. It sounded like you were talking about something from a long time ago.

Moe:
He's always been a very private guy. When he came here, he was only about 10 years old. We had just started the Berry Big Circus around the time that Russell took him in. These are really hard memories to bring up...
Maya:
Acro was so happy to have joined the circus...
Phoenix:
He was especially grateful to the Ringmaster... And I'm sure he is grateful to you too.

Huh? He's grateful to me too? Aww... Shucks. You guys are exaggerating.

Oh yeah. Léon bit someone during that practice.

He's still alive... But when he got bit, he suffered massive brain damage. He'll never recover from the coma that he's in...

Acro's brother (appears after "Get over it"?)

Sean Dingling... But everyone always called him Bat. He fell in love with Regina. Trying to win her love was his downfall.

Moe:
Six months ago... While we were practicing... All of a sudden Bat blurts out, "Let me perform with Léon!"
Maya:
Why'd he do that?
Moe:
I don't know. But that's what caused the accident. I'll never forget that moment... It was so strange... Léon had the weirdest look on his face. He was... Smiling.
Maya:
He? You mean Léon?
Moe:
Yes. Léon. When he bit down, he was smiling. Some sick grin...
Maya:
No way!! That's impossible!!
Phoenix:
(A smirking lion... A flying murderer... Why does it seem that it's always Moe who catches all of these incredible events?)

We never told the police about the incident. The circus would have shut down if we had. The next morning, the Ringmaster took Léon out and shot him with a rifle.

That is for me to decide. I think we should begin our preparations now, Acro.
Phoenix:
Preparations?
von Karma:
I've served a summons on Acro to appear in court tomorrow as a witness. Acro, we'll talk more at the prosecutor's office.
Maya:
Acro... A witness!?
von Karma:
Come Acro. Let's go to the office.
Acro:
Yes, ma'am.
Maya:
Now what do we do, Nick? How are we going to handle tomorrow?
Phoenix:
Don't worry about it. I'll figure something out...
Maya:
Look at you all full of confidence!! You must have found something you can use!
Phoenix:
(This is all beginning to come together now...)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
Exit Magatama session
Phoenix:
(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)
Too many errors during Magatama session
...Mr. Nick......If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter......Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...
Phoenix:
(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)
