Episode 2Turnabout Airlines
Edgeworth:
(The murder that occurred in my office... The return of the Great Thief Yatagarasu... Thinking back, everything began on that fateful day, two days ago...)
-- 2 Days Earlier --
Edgeworth:
(Yes, everything began high up in the air, 9,000 feet in the air, to be precise...)
PA Notice:
Thank you for flying iFly Airlines. We are currently experiencing some slight turbulence. We are asking all passengers to please return to their seats and fasten their seatbelts.
March 12, 6:13 AMFlight I-390, First FloorLounge
Edgeworth:
...Nnngh... ..Why do I feel like I just woke up from a horrible nightmare? (6:13, huh... Guess I was out cold for about 10 minutes. Hah, "slight" turbulence, indeed.)
PA Notice:
Ladies and gentlemen, we are currently experiencing some slight turbulence. For your safety, we ask that you return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
Edgeworth:
(I suppose turbulence is to be expected on a flight. Though admittedly, I'm less than comfortable with anything resembling earthquakes... Hm? What's this...? A travel wallet? But it's not mine... How did someone else's travel wallet wind up in my pocket...? Nnngh...! My head... Why won't this headache go away...? I'll take care of this travel wallet later. Or hand it off to an attendant...) Unngh... From earthquake-like turbulence to an elevator... ............ Hmph. What am I doing hesitating like this? (Actually, I know full well why I hesitate. It was when I was still but a young child... I was caught up in a murder that happened in an elevator. But how long am I going to let past haunt me!? It's just an elevator! I'm a grown man now! I need to behave like one!) Wh......What the...!? What in the world happened!?
???:
Is there something wrong, sir? I must ask that you please return to your se... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! He... He-He-He's DEAD!!!
Edgeworth:
Please calm down! We mustn't jump to conclusions without all the facts...
Passenger:
What's wrong!? Did something happen!?
???:
Y...You MURDERER!!!
Edgeworth:
Wh--!? N-NO! You have it all wrong! It wasn't me!!
March 12, 6:41 AMFlight I-390, Second FloorFirst Class
Teneiro:
Everyone, I am sorry to interrupt, but I have an important announcement. I am one of your flight attendants today, Rhoda Teneiro. Unfortunately, we have just had a minor accident on this flight.
Examine evidence
Front of Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.
Back of Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!
Passenger:
An "accident"!? Don't treat us like we're stupid! I caught a glimpse and it was a murder!
Passenger:
What!? M-Murder!? What's going on with this flight!?
Teneiro:
Everyone, please calm down. There's no reason to panic. The flight will stay on course and make its scheduled landing. We are still currently in the middle of a rough patch of turbulence. So until we are out of this area of turbulence, I ask that you please remain seated...
Passenger:
B-B-But, someone was killed, right!? I mean, what about the killer!? Let me off...!
Teneiro:
Please, there is no need to feel threatened. We already apprehended the culprit.
Edgeworth:
I ask that everyone please remain calm.
Passenger:
What the heck is he talking about!? Why should we remain calm!?
Edgeworth:
My name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a prosecutor and I assure you I am not the killer.
Passenger:
Hah! Being a prosecutor doesn't make you incapable of murder, buddy!
Edgeworth:
Now you listen here! I am not the killer! I simply found the body!
Teneiro:
So you say, however... ...I am sure that you are the perpetrator of this crime. I swear on my honor as a professional flight attendant.
Edgeworth:
Oh, is that right?
Teneiro:
I know what I saw. And there's even very strong, incriminating evidence to back me up.
Edgeworth:
(What kind of "incriminating evidence" is she talking about...?)
Teneiro:
We've already alerted the proper authorities at our destination. Until we land, you will remain in our custody by the powers vested in our captain. I'm very sorry, but please understand our situation.
Edgeworth:
(Your situation? I'm more concerned with mine, and the direction it's going on... I'm not about to just sit idly by while I get accused of murder!) Ms... Teneiro, is it?
Teneiro:
Yes?
Edgeworth:
I was wondering if you might give me a chance.
Teneiro:
A chance? To do what?
Edgeworth:
A chance to plead my case. And a chance to ask what you meant by "incriminating evidence" just now.
Teneiro:
.........
Edgeworth:
To accuse a passenger of such a grave crime without allowing him to give a proper defense... Can the professional flight attendant inside of you really call this action "righteous"?
Teneiro:
......... You have a point. Very well, I'll listen to what you have to say... ...but be wary of what you reveal. I'm afraid you'll only look even more suspicious if your explanation fails to satisfy. I also do not have the time to deal with you all day, so please make it quick.
Edgeworth:
...... Of course. As you wish.
Teneiro:
Good. Very well then, let's get started.
Edgeworth:
(I know for a fact that I didn't kill that man in the elevator. What I don't know is what sort of "evidence" she has up her sleeve... ...but I'm certain it doesn't fit with how the crime really occurred.)
-- What Ms. Teneiro Saw --
Teneiro:
I swear to tell the whole truth as a professional flight attendant.
Unfortunately for you, Mr. Edgeworth, I am certain you are the killer.
The scene I saw in front of the elevator...
...it was you, standing there, with fresh blood dripping off of the murder weapon.
So, if you would please cooperate, we'll turn you over just as soon as we land.
Edgeworth:
(That's it...? That's her evidence...!?)
Teneiro:
I don't think you could ask for a more perfect witness testimony. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
(Not really. It's hardly perfect when there's a gaping hole in it.)
Rebuttal
-- What Ms. Teneiro Saw --
Teneiro:
I swear to tell the whole truth as a professional flight attendant.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Tell me, what exactly puts the "pro" in "professional flight attendant" for you?
Teneiro:
Well, it means we are very professional about how we take care of our passengers. Services like fetching papers and responding to calls are done with speed and accuracy. I can assure you that I give testimonies with the same level of professionalism. But I'm sure you have already realized that by now, right!?
Edgeworth:
(It's a bit hard to "appreciate" your professionalism when I'm the one under suspicion.)
Teneiro:
And there you have it. My professional testimony is accurate and reliable.
Teneiro:
Unfortunately for you, Mr. Edgeworth, I am certain you are the killer.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You certainly seem sure of yourself.
Teneiro:
Of course! A professional flight attendant can't afford to make mistakes, after all.
Edgeworth:
Perhaps. But you must admit there are few who can look at a murder with a clear mind.
Teneiro:
We attendants all go through extensive training and are always calm and collected. We'll even calmly serve you coffee, if you so wish, as the plane makes a splashdown.
Edgeworth:
(I fail to see how that would be the calm and rational thing to do in an emergency.)
Teneiro:
Even until the bitter end, we are there to serve the passengers. That is the duty of all professional flight attendants!
Edgeworth:
You certainly are confident. Anyway, shall we return to your testimony?
Teneiro:
The scene I saw in front of the elevator...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Yes...? What did you see in front of the elevator?
Teneiro:
That's what I was just about to tell you, Mr. Edgeworth. Framed by the elevator doors and bathed in the light coming from within...
Teneiro:
...it was you, standing there, with fresh blood dripping off of the murder weapon.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The murder weapon, dripping with blood...? Really, now.
Teneiro:
I swear that was the grisly scene I saw before me. Thank goodness it wasn't a passenger who saw, or there'd be widespread panic by now.
Edgeworth:
As I recall, you were quite panicked yourself at the time...
Teneiro:
............ Excuse me?
Edgeworth:
You were scared enough to misread the situation and accuse me of murder.
Teneiro:
Nonsense! Professional flight attendants cannot afford to be that flustered! I witnessed the murder scene and am now listening to your defense, all with a smile.
Edgeworth:
(Apparently, you also lie with a smile on your face.)
Present Travel Wallet
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Ms. Teneiro!"
Teneiro:
So, if you would please cooperate, we'll turn you over just as soon as we land.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I am not the culprit... And yet, you would keep these restraints on me?
Teneiro:
Mr. Edgeworth, please try to understand what kind of situation you're in right now.
Edgeworth:
And what exactly is my situation?
Teneiro:
I have the backing of the captain to keep you bound in this way. We are within our legal right to restrain anyone who might threaten our captain mid-flight. In essence, you're in the same situation as someone who has been arrested by the police.
Edgeworth:
(So I am to stay restrained until I can clear up all of her doubts? At least I'm close.)
Edgeworth:
(Her mistake shines like the sliver lining on a dark rain cloud. And I'm going to capture some of that light with evidence!)
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro!
Teneiro:
Wh-Wh-What is with the yelling all of a sudden!?
Edgeworth:
(Argh. Force of habit. Well, it doesn't matter.) Ms. Teneiro. You say you saw the murder weapon dripping with blood. Is that correct?
Teneiro:
Yes. All that blood... Drip, drip, drip... Just recalling that scene sends a chill down my spine.
Edgeworth:
Sorry, but your so-called "professional" flight attendant training has failed you.
Teneiro:
Wh-What!?
Edgeworth:
I'd like to direct your attention to this! Do you know what this is?
Teneiro:
It's... a travel wallet, right? But it looks a little big and bulky...
Edgeworth:
The thing you saw me holding when I discovered the dead body in the elevator... ...was this very travel wallet, Ms. Teneiro.
Teneiro:
What!? Impossible...!
Edgeworth:
Now then, do you still think I am the killer? That I killed him with a travel wallet?
Teneiro:
But... But...! I...! No, but I... I saw blood dripping from the wallet! I know I did!
Edgeworth:
As you can see, this wallet is clearly stained. But if you would be so kind as to take a whiff... ...I think you'd agree it's grape juice.
Teneiro:
Ah! Then... Then...!
Edgeworth:
That's right. You mistook grape juice for blood! The murder weapon dripping with blood does not, in fact, exist!
Teneiro:
N-Nooooooooooooooo!
Edgeworth:
(There. That should clear up that pesky accusation.)
Hold it!
Teneiro:
W-Wait just a sec! That is... I mean, even a wallet could be deadly if it was wrapped around something heavy! I demand that you show me what's inside... Please...
Edgeworth:
(She's trembling, and the tacked on "please" at the end... Sounds like I've got her.) There's no need to look inside. Even you can tell from its appearance that it's light.
Teneiro:
No! I can't be sure of anything until I see the contents of that wallet for myself!
Edgeworth:
(*sigh* She's a persistent one. I suppose we have no choice but to see what's inside.) Ms. Teneiro, if you would be so kind as to open the wallet and check its contents for me.
Teneiro:
Alright. I usually don't pry into passengers' belongings, but we have no choice here.
Examine grape juice stains on Travel Wallet
Edgeworth:
Grape juice stains the outer cover. True, it was I who dropped it in the juice, however, I didn't do it out of ill intentions.
Examine button on Travel Wallet
Edgeworth:
It seems that this passport is all that's in here.
Leads to:
"As you saw, there is nothing but a passport inside."
Edgeworth:
As you saw, there is nothing but a passport inside. This renders your "wallet was the murder weapon" argument moot. Wouldn't you agree?
Hold it!
Teneiro:
Please, hear me out, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
What is it now...?
Teneiro:
Well, I was wondering... whose passport is it exactly?
Edgeworth:
.........
Teneiro:
Can I take a look...?
Edgeworth:
Why not? I'm rather curious myself. Th-This is...!
Teneiro:
Just as I thought... This travel wallet belonged to Mr. Akbey Hicks... ...which makes it the victim's property.
Wallet data updated in my Organizer.
Examine evidence
Inside of Travel Wallet
Edgeworth:
There's no money whatsoever inside the travel wallet.
Teneiro:
You... You stole the victim's wallet... ...didn't you...?
Edgeworth:
H-How dare you!?
Teneiro:
You said it yourself. You claimed to be holding this wallet in your hands when I found you.
Edgeworth:
.........
Teneiro:
Perhaps I did misconstrue the wallet for the murder weapon.... ...but it seems that I wasn't wrong about who the culprit is.
-- Ms. Teneiro's Logic --
Teneiro:
As you claimed, the murder weapon is not the travel wallet...
...however, it IS something you stole from Mr. Hicks after you were done with the vile deed.
I find it hard to believe myself, but your motive was very simple...
You were out to steal Mr. Hick's money, weren't you?
Edgeworth:
So even though I didn't have the murder weapon on me, you still suspect me, I see...
Teneiro:
You stood up at the crime scene with the victim's wallet in your hands. How can I turn a blind eye and not suspect you of foul play?
Rebuttal
-- Ms. Teneiro's Logic --
Teneiro:
As you claimed, the murder weapon is not the travel wallet...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Shouldn't that be proof enough for you that I did not murder the victim?
Teneiro:
Not at all!
Edgeworth:
Oh, and why not?
Teneiro:
Because, that wallet may not have been what I thought it was...
Teneiro:
...however, it IS something you stole from Mr. Hicks after you were done with the vile deed.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You think I stole it...?
Teneiro:
Yes! I'm very sorry to say it, and I wouldn't usually be so rude, but it must be said!
Edgeworth:
?
Teneiro:
I never thought I'd see the day, but here I am calling a passenger a thief!
Edgeworth:
.........
Teneiro:
Maybe I should put on a serious face and say it more directly. I believe you removed the wallet from the victim's personage!
Edgeworth:
...It really doesn't matter how you phrase it. What I'd like to know is why you think I stole Mr. Hick's wallet!
Teneiro:
I find it hard to believe myself, but your motive was very simple...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Hmph, I don't think I have any sort of motive to speak of. I've never met Mr. Hicks before, and our only connection is this one flight.
Teneiro:
But that is more than enough of a reason.
Edgeworth:
How do you figure?
Teneiro:
He was sitting in First Class, and I think the implication is quite clear.
Teneiro:
You were out to steal Mr. Hick's money, weren't you?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You think I was after his money!? Wh-Where did that cockamamie idea come from!?
Teneiro:
True, you are also a passenger in First Class, but... ...I thought something was off about you and those deeply-etched lines on your forehead.
Edgeworth:
Th-They're not lines!! They're perfectly normal and a part of my natural face!
Teneiro:
I don't think I've ever met someone with such terrible countenance on a flight before.
Edgeworth:
.........
Teneiro:
And that's when it hit me. You have the face of someone with money trouble!
Present Crime Scene Notes
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I wonder if I might get a word in, Ms. Teneiro.
Teneiro:
Wh-What is it now!?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro. I wonder if you noticed the contradiction within your own testimony!
Teneiro:
Wh-What are you talking about...?
Edgeworth:
It's simply impossible that the motive for this murder was monetary theft. One glance at the crime scene should've told you that! (What about this scene would prove that the motive for the murder was not the money?)
Present floor
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"If I may direct your attention to things strewn all over the floor..."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This proves that the killer's motive was not monetary theft!
Teneiro:
Where am I supposed to be looking...?
Edgeworth:
...Please recall how the crime scene looked.
Teneiro:
I'm trying... but all I can see is you taking the wallet... ...and the deep furrowing of your eyebrows and the lines on your forehead.
Edgeworth:
Gnrk! There's no need to recall those specific details, thank you very much. (Now, what can I show her to prove my point in a way that even she will understand?)
Leads back to:
"(What about this scene would prove that the motive for the murder was not the money?)"
Edgeworth:
If I may direct your attention to things strewn all over the floor...
Teneiro:
Ah!
Edgeworth:
That's right. The floor is covered in bills and coinage. By your rationale, these were the very things the killer was after.
Teneiro:
Aaaah!
Edgeworth:
I think we can assume that the wallet fell during the victim's struggle with his killer. And I would think that the killer would've noticed something like money scattering somewhere. Furthermore, as you can see, there was no effort made by the killer to gather the money!
Teneiro:
B-But...! The wallet...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Ah, yes. the wallet. You will also recall that the only thing in it was Mr. Hicks's passport.
Teneiro:
Aaaah!
Edgeworth:
If you are really insisting that it was a crime based on greed... ...then you're claiming that it was all for an empty travel wallet!
Leads to:
"I...I...I..."
Present Travel Wallet
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I wonder if I might get a word in, Ms. Teneiro.
Teneiro:
Wh-What is it now!?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro. I wonder if you noticed the contradiction within your own testimony!
Teneiro:
Wh-What are you talking about...?
Edgeworth:
Simply put, as you saw with your own eyes... ...the only thing inside Mr. Hicks's wallet was his passport!
Teneiro:
Ah!
Edgeworth:
If I really was "after his money"... ...then why would I steal a penniless travel wallet!?
Teneiro:
Gnrk! Ah, but that's right! You... Mr. Edgeworth... You didn't know it was empty when you stole it!
Edgeworth:
You would like to think that, but that's not possible.
Teneiro:
What do you mean it's not possible!?
Edgeworth:
There is no way the killer didn't know that the wallet was empty to begin with.
Teneiro:
Oh? And what makes you so sure!?
Edgeworth:
(How can I show her that the killer knew the wallet to be empty from the get-go?)
Present Crime Scene Notes
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"If you would recall the crime scene..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence shows that the killer would've known that the wallet was empty!
Teneiro:
And what about it shows me that...?
Edgeworth:
...Take a closer look.
Teneiro:
I am, but all I can see... ...is futile struggling of a professional prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
Urrk! I think you've scrutinized it for long enough, thank you. (I have to show her something even she can understand!)
Leads back to:
"(How can I show her that the killer knew the wallet to be empty from the get-go?)"
Edgeworth:
If you would recall the crime scene... I admit that the wallet was probably not empty at the time of the murder. That's pretty evident by the bills and cards strewn around the inside of the elevator.
Teneiro:
Oh, no!
Edgeworth:
I think you've come to realize the problem with your logic. I would surmise that the victim's wallet fell out during their struggle. And that's when its contents emptied onto the floor of the elevator. I doubt the killer could've missed such an occurrence.
Teneiro:
Th-Then, you're saying...!
Edgeworth:
Yes. According to your supposition, if I were the killer... ...I would have been going after a wallet I knew to be empty. And since I clearly was not attempting to gather the scattered money... ...it renders your argument of theft completely invalid!
Leads to:
"I...I...I..."
Edgeworth:
(She... really is making a fool of herself, pursuing this line of logic. I should spare her and present the piece of evidence that contradicts her testimony.)
Teneiro:
I...I...I... Forgive meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease!
Passenger:
Hey! What the heck!?
Passenger:
Are you saying the attendant's wrong!?
Passenger:
So that guy isn't the killer!?
Passenger:
Hah! Don't believe it, everyone! It's a trick!
Teneiro:
Nnnngh...
Edgeworth:
Will you all please be quiet!? Ms. Teneiro.
Teneiro:
Yes?
Edgeworth:
You lost your cool when you saw the dead body. Plus, the lounge was dark, and looking into the light from the elevator... ...it's easy to see how you mistook the wallet in my hand for the murder weapon. I take no offense that you thought that I was the killer.
Teneiro:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Thank you for releasing me.
???:
Borginese speaking!
Edgeworth:
(Wh-What is it now!?)
???:
Borginese speaking, Borginese speaking?!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro, if you could please translate, I'd be much obliged.
Teneiro:
I-It sounds like Borginian... But I... ...I don't understand any of it. There's another attendant on this flight who...
???:
I said that he is giving the runabout!
Edgeworth:
!
???:
I don't require an interpreter! I speak English just well! See! You, the attendant!
Teneiro:
Y-Yes, sir!
???:
I want this person to be under the arrest until we arrive at the airport!
Edgeworth:
......
Teneiro:
......
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, sir, but what exactly are you hoping for?
???:
What is it you want? I am finished talking to the likes of you.
Edgeworth:
Please, I would like to hear why you would like me to be held under arrest until we land!
???:
You! How dare you try to waste my time!?
Edgeworth:
(You were the one who stuck your nose into my affairs!)
???:
I wanted to spend even at least one more second with my precious art! I have no time for other things! I know what you are! I see through you! Insolvent! Yes, I am pretty sure that's how you say it in English!
Edgeworth:
(Well, I'd hope that I don't dissolve in water, but I don't think that's what you meant.) I'm sorry, but I don't think I caught your name.
Lablanc:
I am Zinc Lablanc II. I am a very wealthy man in the Borginia! But I am not an ordinary rich man! I am an art dealer... a rich seller of beauty!
Teneiro:
Mr. Lablanc, what did you mean just now?
Lablanc:
Pardon!?
Teneiro:
Um, when you said that Mr. Edgeworth was giving me the "runabout"?
Lablanc:
I have to explain!? Unbelievable... I will say it once and only once. I do not have even a second to waste! "Time is money" as they say!
Edgeworth:
(Yes, and yet you continue to blather on...)
Lablanc:
I saw it, yes I did. I saw the victim go onto the elevator. Going down to the lounge! It was exactly at 6 o'clock!
Edgeworth:
......
Teneiro:
......A-And what's the significance of that time...?
Edgeworth:
(At 6, he says......) W-Wait, you saw him at 6!?!?
Teneiro:
Aaaah! Wh-What's the matter, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Lablanc:
He understands, I see. Ms. Attendant! What time did you discover the body!?
Teneiro:
Well, it was a little after that patch of turbulence, so I would say around 6:15... Ah!
Lablanc:
"Hicks" was his name, was it? Then I say that man Hicks was killed in the 15 minute time span. And the only person in the lounge at that time was this prosecutor, yes?
Edgeworth:
.........
Passenger:
Y-Yeah! I-I was in my seat the whole time!
Passenger:
M-Me, too! I was watching the movie and enjoying a fine glass of grape juice!
Passenger:
I was still eating! Still haven't finished, see!
Lablanc:
The other passengers have an alibi, so you have no problem with them, I suppose?
Edgeworth:
.........
Lablanc:
"No compliant", I see. Not a single word against this, right?
Edgeworth:
...I have no way of discounting what you have put forth at this point, but it wasn't me.
Lablanc:
Oh!? So you say! But do you have, what you say, the evidence?
Teneiro:
Mr. Edgeworth... Are you really the culprit after all...?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Lablanc. I suppose you are quite certain in what you saw? Enough to give testimony? .........
Lablanc:
Of course! I was looking at that man the whole time! He was playing with that annoying little... um... small "machine" the whole time!
Edgeworth:
"Machine"...?
Lablanc:
Yes, that's what you people call it in English, yes? It was making me crazy with the click, click, click!
Edgeworth:
(From that description, it sounds like some sort of small computer...)
Teneiro:
I believe what Mr. Lablanc is talking about is a cell phone. I have to say that I did see him playing with it quite a bit, myself.
Edgeworth:
(A simple cell phone? A laptop or organizer I can see, but... That's kind of... low budget.)
Lablanc:
I hate that noisy little machine in his hand! Not a fragment of beauty! All it produces is ugly sounds! Anyway, I know what I saw!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro.
Teneiro:
Yes?
Edgeworth:
I was wondering if I might be granted permission to examine the crime scene.
Teneiro:
What!? You want to... examine the crime scene?
Edgeworth:
If you would grant me a little measure of time, I'm sure I can produce the real culprit.
Lablanc:
Hmph. I don't like the sound of that. "Fox in the duck pen". Yes, I think that is how you say it in English.
Edgeworth:
It's "Fox guarding the henhouse." And I believe my innocence was proven earlier. And if I'm given the chance, I can clear up all the remaining doubts.
Teneiro:
.........
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro! If you wait until we arrive... ...there is a good chance that some evidence will have been destroyed by then.
Teneiro:
......... ...I understand. Let me see what the captain has to say.
Lablanc:
Hah! This should not be approved!
Teneiro:
Please, Mr. Lablanc! In an emergency, all decisions are to be made by the captain alone. Now, please wait here while I go ask the captain what to do. I'll be right back.
Lablanc:
You are not planning to erase evidence when you are doing your investigation, yes?
Edgeworth:
Of course not!
Lablanc:
Hah, we will see!
Teneiro:
Mr. Edgeworth, you have the captain's permission to investigate the crime scene.
Lablanc:
Wh-What!? Unbelievable!!
Edgeworth:
I am in your debt, Ms. Teneiro.
Teneiro:
However... there is one condition. I am to supervise you. Can you agree to that?
Edgeworth:
Of course, I see no problem with that stipulation. It's only natural as I am still a suspect in this case.
Lablanc:
Grrrrrr...
Teneiro:
I take full responsibility and will watch Mr. Edgeworth's every move.I hope this is reassurance enough that there will be no foul play. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, shall we proceed? If you should need my help with anything, please feel free to touch the Partner Button.
Edgeworth:

Captain's permission
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro, I'd like to ask you about investigating the lounge...
Teneiro:
As long as you have the captain's permission, I can't stop you from looking around.
Edgeworth:
If you could pass a message along, tell him I'm grateful for his spirit of cooperation.
Teneiro:
I will. However, please realize that you are still under suspicion. To be honest, I still have my doubts about you.
Edgeworth:
Of course, and I take no offense.
Teneiro:
Do you really understand what I'm saying?
Edgeworth:
Yes, verily.
Teneiro:
Do you pinky-swear you do, on your honor as a professional prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
I-I pinky-swear I do, on my honor as a professional prosecutor.
Teneiro:
Well! I guess that settles that.
Edgeworth:
(I... I feel my honor as a man slowly diminishing.)
Present
Anything
Teneiro:
Even if you show that to me, I still cannot allow you free reign. I'm sorry, but I must admit that I still have my doubts about you.
Edgeworth:
(Guilty until proven innocent, I see...)
Door on right
Teneiro:
That leads to the emergency escape hatch. You can't go there in mid-flight.
Edgeworth:
What's the probability that the criminal escaped through here?
Teneiro:
A hundred percent.
Edgeworth:
!
Teneiro:
............ Oh! Let me finish my thought. I'm 100% certain they didn't.
Edgeworth:
(When I'm searching for an answer, only complete thoughts need apply.)
Attendant in front of door
Edgeworth:
Excuse me, but may I have a word with you?
???:
............
Edgeworth:
You there!
???:
............*yawn* ...If you need something, please ask Ms. Rhoda over there, OK?
Edgeworth:
What the...? Hey! Wake up, you!
Teneiro:
I'm terribly sorry that she's being so rude, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
No need for you to apologize. I just find it hard to believe she's asleep on the job! (If I were her boss, I'd see to it that her salary was cut so low that it was in the red.)
Dishes
Teneiro:
How did you find your meal to be, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Come to think of it, I forgot all about it. I must have been asleep or something.
Teneiro:
Oh! I'm terribly sorry! Let me prepare you something right away!
Edgeworth:
...What are you apologizing for, Ms. Teneiro?
Teneiro:
I've failed in my professional duties by letting a passenger go hungry! Please, help yourself! If you see anything to your fancy, feel free!
Edgeworth:
Ah, I think I'll take my time later, after I've solved this case. Thanks.
Elevator button
Teneiro:
In order to preserve the crime scene, I'm afraid the elevator is not in service. To get to the first floor lounge, we should take the stairs.
Vase on seat
Edgeworth:
Mr. Lablanc seems to be protecting the gargantuan vase on the chair rather closely.
Teneiro:
It's a marvelous vase, though, isn't it? Yes, I dare say so as a professional attendant.
Edgeworth:
I don't think there's any real connection between a piece of art and being an attendant...
Teneiro:
But I'm not just any old attendant! I'm a PROFESSIONAL flight attendant.
Edgeworth:
(As though there were such a thing as an amateur flight attendant.)
Movie poster
Edgeworth:
It's a movie poster for... "License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder"...
Teneiro:
That's an iFly Airlines sponsored movie. It's a suspense-hardboiled-action-romance-horror-comedy movie.
Edgeworth:
...Is that the genre listing for this movie?
Teneiro:
Yes. It's a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone because it encompasses all those genres!
Edgeworth:
...I can't even begin to imagine what the plot of this movie would be like.
Teneiro:
But you have to admit it piqued your curiosity, right? I heard the main strategy with this genre listing was to make people curious.
Edgeworth:
.........Well then, consider the mission a successful one.
Zinc Lablanc II
Lablanc:
Hurry up and investigate! Time should not be wasted! "Precious is human time!" is how you say it, I believe.
Black bag on seat
Edgeworth:
This was Mr. Hicks's seat. I don't see the "machine" Mr. Lablanc was talking about...
Teneiro:
Perhaps it's in the elevator?
Edgeworth:
Maybe. We should probably head down to the crime scene now.
Edgeworth's seat
Edgeworth:
It's my seat. Unfortunately, I didn't bring anything particularly useful for an investigation. (It's not as if I'm constantly prepared for such a thing to occur...)
Passenger wearing life jacket
Passenger:
Unnnnnnnnngh... D-Don't get-t-t-t near m-m-m-me... y-you criminal!
Teneiro:
He said, "Don't get near me, you criminal!"
Edgeworth:
I am not the killer, and I intend to prove that starting now.
Passenger:
B-B-But th-that's c-c-contrary to th-the f-f-facts!
Teneiro:
He says, "But that's contrary to the facts!"
Edgeworth:
I can understand his English just fine, thank you very much.
Chessboard
Edgeworth:
Ah, that's right. I was in the middle of recreating a chess game.
Teneiro:
Just an observation, but aren't there too many red knights around that lone blue pawn?
Edgeworth:
...Nonsense. It simply shows that the blue pawn is no match for the red knights' might.
Lifesaver
Edgeworth:
What's a lifesaver doing here...&#160;?
Passenger:
I-I-I bought it a-at the in-f-f-flight shop just be-beyond the lounge! If-If something sh-should happen, having o-o-one will s-save your life!
Edgeworth:
(I think this guy would've been better off not taking a plane to begin with.)
Passenger drinking grape juice
Passenger:
Hey, miss... How about another glass...?
Edgeworth:
Excuse me, but I was wondering if you know anything about the murder...
Passenger:
...How about it? How about a glass together?
Edgeworth:
Um, sorry, but I must decline.
Passenger:
I wasn't talking to you! I was asking the cute attendant!
Teneiro:
I'm sorry, but I'm on the clock right now. But if you need a refill, I'd be happy to bring you another glass at any time.
Passenger:
You got it, toots!
Edgeworth:
(Th-That's no way to talk to a lady!)
Passenger eating steak
Edgeworth:
If I may have a word with you...
Passenger:
This...*munch*...steak...*munch* *munch* so... *munch*...awesome...*munch*
Edgeworth:
That's great to hear, however, I would like to ask you a few questions...
Passenger:
I...*munch*...was... here...*munch* *munch*... whole time so...*munch* wouldn't know...
Edgeworth:
Eat or speak. Please pick one.
Passenger:
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH
Teneiro:
I think he chose to eat...
Edgeworth:
(Yes, I can hear that.)
Grape juice bottles
Edgeworth:
Look at all these bottles, lined up in a row. It's miracle they made it through the turbulence without a scratch...
Teneiro:
Actually, we asked the drink vendor to clean up all the ones that did break earlier.
Edgeworth:
Then you mean to tell me he put all these up here after the turbulence...?
Teneiro:
We are simply thrilled to have someone so interested in the variety of drinks available!
Edgeworth:
(I don't think anyone should drink this much. There us such a thing as over-hydration...)
Parfait
Edgeworth:
One very large parfait... though I could easily finish it off all by myself.
Teneiro:
This parfait is an iFly original: the iFly Parfait! The "i" comes from "I love you", while the "Fly" part comes from "Flying". When you combine the two parts, you get "iFly"!
Edgeworth:
(I fail to see how the "i" came from "I love you"...!)
March 12, 7:26 AMFlight I-390, First FloorLounge
Edgeworth:
I want to thank you for your help back there, Ms. Teneiro.
Teneiro:
It was nothing. You should thank the captain for granting you permission. And just so everything is perfectly clear... I still don't trust you to that extent. I don't want you to think your standing with me has changed.
Edgeworth:
I see. I will bear that in mind.
Teneiro:
I received an order from the captain earlier. He wanted you to know that... ...we reserve the right to stop your investigation if we feel you are not making progress. And when we do, he asks that you please return to your seat at that time.
Edgeworth:
(So my time runs out at his and his crew's discretion, does it? I have to find a way to discredit Mr. Lablanc's testimony before time's up!) I understand. By the way, is there any place you can think of where the killer might hide onboard?
Teneiro:
I don't think so. After every First Class passenger was accounted for at his or her seat... ...we made a thorough search of the plane. As for Business and Economy class... ...no one can move between those two classes and First Class without a staff keycard. And we found no record of a keycard being used at all.
Edgeworth:
(Which means that I have a First Class Killer on my hands. At least I know that much for sure. And one other thing. No one else has been allowed near this crime scene since the murder was discovered either.)
Begin Investigation
First Floor Lounge
Edgeworth:
Now then, let's get started.
Teneiro:
But where would we start from?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Let's start with Mr. Lablanc's statements. The crime occurred between 6 AM and 6:15 AM. During that interval, the only person in the lounge was myself. Which would make me the prime suspect. However, since I did not kill Mr. Hicks, it means that the killer was around somewhere (Where was the killer? – What clues point to where the killer could have been?)...
Teneiro:
If we are to believe what you say is true, then yes.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... The first order of business will be to gather information to win your trust.
Logic
"Blunt force trauma" and "Murder weapon: Mr. Ifly"
Edgeworth:
A statue with blood on it lying next to the body of a man who was beaten to death...
Teneiro:
Oh! Mr. Edgeworth! I think I figured something out!
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes? What is it?
Teneiro:
The way the blood is on this, it looks like it matches up with the wound on his head!
Edgeworth:
(Well, aren't we deserving of the Master of the Obvious title...)
Teneiro:
Well? What do you think, Mr. Edgeworth? Don't you think that's worth investigating?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It would appear that this figurine is our murder weapon.
Teneiro:
Oh, I just knew it! I mean, I can't think of any other connection!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, perhaps Master of the Oblivious would be more befitting...)
Mr. Ifly Piggy Bank data jotted down in my Organizer.
"Where was the killer?" and "Elevator"
Edgeworth:
(True, there wasn't anyone else in the lounge other than myself right before the turbulence... ...but if the killer was in the elevator along with the victim (In the elevator with Hicks? - If only I could prove that the killer rode the elevator with Hicks...). then that's a different story.)
"In the elevator with Hicks?" and "Spilled grape juice"
Edgeworth:
I have it!
Teneiro:
? I'm sorry, but I don't understand, Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
I can prove that someone other than myself was here around the time of the murder.
Teneiro:
What!? R-Really!?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It's rather simple, actually. The proof is in the pudding. Or rather, the grape juice in this case. These footsteps here confess to me this very fact... ...that someone exited the elevator, alive. Seeing as how the victim is dead, that would mean a second person.
Teneiro:
But... couldn't the footprints be from Mr. Hicks himself?
Edgeworth:
Ah, but if you take a look at out victim's shoes, you can see the soles are spotless.
Teneiro:
Which means...
Edgeworth:
...Mr. Hicks wasn't alone in the elevator. In fact, it's quite the opposite. There was actually one other person inside the elevator!
Grape Juice Footprints data jotted down in my Organizer.
Partner
Teneiro:
Are you in need of assistance?
Notice anything? (appears after examining grape juice stain)
Edgeworth:
Did you notice anything?
Teneiro:
I was wondering whose footprints are next to the elevator.
Edgeworth:
I'd say killer's, wouldn't you say? Even if they aren't, I'm sure they are a vital clue to solving this case.
Teneiro:
Ooh, maybe there are other clues waiting to be found in other places. Come on now, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go find them together.
Edgeworth:
(A word of advice: Nobody likes a credit thief, so stop stealing my lines.)
About the victim (appears after examining body and figure)
Edgeworth:
I was wondering if you noticed anything, Ms. Teneiro.
Teneiro:
Yes... I can't help but notice the sad atmosphere in here.
Edgeworth:
Um, hmm, yes... It is a rather tragic crime.
Teneiro:
I'll say. Robbing the poor man after bludgeoning him to death, talk about rubbing in the salt! I can't forgive someone who would do this to a passenger of mine! I swear as a professional flight attendant that I will capture the culprit with my own hands!
Edgeworth:
And I promise as a prosecutor to solve this case with logic and deduction. (I should go over all the leads I've collected so far one more time. The key to solving this lies at the intersection of my logic and the evidence.)
Present
Grape Juice Footprints
Edgeworth:
If these footprints do, in fact, belong to the culprit... ..then I would say it was very careless to leave them.
Teneiro:
If I was a killer, I swear that as a professional killer, I'd never leave footprints behind!
Edgeworth:
That's all well and good, but I'm afraid it's of little use in our pursuit of the killer. (I feel like I'm still missing a link or two...)
Blue door
Teneiro:
This door leads to the flight attendants' room. But please understand that it's off limits to unauthorized personnel.
Edgeworth:
(The room is giving off the scent of women's perfume. One would think that perfume would "smell great", however, to me it simply "smells"... Not that I have any interest in what lies behind this door...)
Teneiro:
Perhaps we should return to the investigation, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Hm...........................
Teneiro:
Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Sorry, I spaced out for a second there.
Glasses
Edgeworth:
(These bottles and glasses must have been broken by the turbulence.) There is quite a bit of broken glass here. Please be careful when passing through the area.
Teneiro:
Thank you very much for the warning, Mr. Edgeworth. However, no matter how kind you are towards me... ...know that it does not clear up any suspicions I have about you.
Edgeworth:
I-I wasn't warning you for the sake of clearing my name!!
Piano
Teneiro:
This grand piano is the pride of this plane. It can play the music of whatever CD we insert into its CD drive.
Edgeworth:
That's not a piano! It's more like an overgrown music box.
Teneiro:
Ah, but its keys depress along with the music, as though there really is someone playing it.
Edgeworth:
(Some people have entirely too much money to waste on overly-complex toys.)
Windows
Edgeworth:
(These counter windows offer a glimpse of the sky, but these clouds, they tell me nothing...)
Teneiro:
Mr. Edgeworth...? You... look like you're talking to the clouds.
Edgeworth:
Is that so? Then tell me, what do you suppose I said to them?
Teneiro:
I don't know, but it looked like a rather one-sided conversation.
Edgeworth:
(The clouds... They tell me nothing.)
Magazines
Edgeworth:
There are a few copies of Sky Magazine in the magazine rack.
Teneiro:
This month's special is an English trivia quiz.
Edgeworth:
That's not a bad idea. I've heard that the youth of today don't know a particle from a participle.
Teneiro:
Now, now, Please don't go around confusing people with made-up words, Mr. Edgeworth. Who's ever heard of such a silly word as "participle"?
Edgeworth:
(Case in point...)
Statue on left
Edgeworth:
What, or who, is this...?
Teneiro:
This is a bronze statue of the founder of iFly Airlines, Mr. Hugo Ifly. The one on the left is of when he was in his 40's and the other is of him in his 80's.
Edgeworth:
(...Did the man actually age in the span of four decades? Maybe I need to squint more.)
Toppled-over chair
Edgeworth:
(This toppled-over chair... Yet another victim of the turbulence.)
Teneiro:
Aaaaah!! Nooo! Look at all that grape juice staining the back...! It may not look it, but this chair was extremely valuable.
Edgeworth:
It was?
Teneiro:
Yes! It was used when the Rocker Pals came to tour this plane. The Rocker Pals' leader sat in this very chair.
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but what are these "Rocker Pals"?
Teneiro:
I can't believe you've never heard of them! They're all the rage! The Rocker Pals are an extremely popular international band. They added the "Pals" part as they became more popular, especially among teens.
Edgeworth:
Ah, that explains it. I'm not really one for the music of today. (Maybe I should ask Detective Gumshoe about them later... On second thought... I can already see how confusing the conversation would get.)
Body
Edgeworth:
What floors does this elevator service?
Teneiro:
Only the first and second, although, it can also go down to the cargo hold. However, that requires a flight crew keycard.
Edgeworth:
(So the only floors accessible to passengers are the first and second (Elevator - The victim's body was found inside the elevator that connects 1F with 2F), huh?)
Before examining body and figure and deducing lanyard
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining body and figure and deducing lanyard
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Floor
Edgeworth:
Money is strewn all over the floor of the elevator. I would guess it was all in Mr. Hicks's wallet at some point.
Teneiro:
It's been a while since I've seen this big of a mess. It's terribly embarrassing, but I thought it was an earthquake for a second... ...and I frantically started searching for gas values to shut off.
Edgeworth:
It was? (I guess the shaking of the plane was bad enough to be mistaken for a real earthquake. Not that I would know, since I was unconscious for most of it...)
Body
Edgeworth:
I doubt anyone was expecting to find a dead body in an elevator on this flight.
Teneiro:
So Mr. Hicks... He's really d-dead?
Edgeworth:
Yes. (She's trembling, although I can't fault her for that when there's a corpse right there.)
Teneiro:
Mr. Hicks... If you're really dead, then please answer, "yes"...
Edgeworth:
(I see she's over the trembling now... although a new symptom seems to have appeared... Anyway, I should focus on the victim's body. Let's see...) There's blood on the back of Mr. Hicks's dead... Could this be the cause of death? He appears to have been struck (Blunt force trauma - Wound on the back of Hicks's head suggests blunt force trauma, but what caused it?) very hard... Even his glasses (Broken glasses - The victim's glasses are broken Were they broken during his murder?) are broken...
Pocket
Edgeworth:
(Hm? There's something sticking out of his pocket. Hope he won't mind if I take a look at what's inside.).........Hm? It's a picture. It looks like it was taken inside a building somewhere.
Photo of Mr. Hicks data jotted down in my Organizer.
Lanyard
Edgeworth:
(I wonder what was hanging off of this lanyard? Something's missing from this picture... Now if I could just put my finger on it...)
Lanyard (after deduce)
Edgeworth:
The "machine" that should be hanging off of here must still be somewhere on this plane!
Figure
Edgeworth:
What is this... sinister-looking figure on the floor here?
Teneiro:
Oh, that's a piggy bank of our company mascot, Mr. Ifly. It's just one of the many pieces of merchandise we sell at out in-flight shop. This bank is a limited edition, and is so popular that we're down to our last one.
Edgeworth:
You have an in-flight shop...?
Teneiro:
Yes. It's just beyond the lounge to the right. The shutter to the store is closed at the moment... ...but it was open the whole flight ip until Mr. Hicks's body was discovered.
Edgeworth:
(There's blood on here... Could this have been the murder weapon (Murder weapon: Mr. Ifly - The blood on it is still fresh... Could this be the murder weapon?)?)
Deduce (after examining pocket)
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce lanyard and Present Photo of Mr. Hicks
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"Mr. Hicks's "machine" is nowhere to be found."
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
This crime scene completely contradicts this piece of evidence!
Teneiro:
...I'm sorry, but where?
Edgeworth:
Ah, I see the truth here in my mind's eye. I'll try to explain it in a simpler fashion for you.
Teneiro:
Um, alright...
Edgeworth:
(There's something missing from this scene in front of me. And I'll show Ms. Teneiro what's "off" through that piece of evidence!)
Edgeworth:
Mr. Hicks's "machine" is nowhere to be found.
Teneiro:
His "machine"...?
Edgeworth:
Ahem, his cell phone, Ms. Teneiro.
Teneiro:
Ah, so I guess because it's not here...
Edgeworth:
Yes, I think we can safely deduce that the killer took it.
Missing Cell Phone data jotted down in my Organizer.
Grape juice stains
Edgeworth:
There's some spilled grape juice in front of the elevator. (I assume it was spilled during the turbulence.)
Teneiro:
Oh, we must clean up or someone might get hurt...
Edgeworth:
Aha!
Teneiro:
? What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I've found some very important evidence. What is the important piece of evidence in this scene?
Present footprints
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"What is it...?"
Present lines
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
These lines here... They obviously weren't made naturally.
Teneiro:
You're right! But how were they made then, and why are they here?
Edgeworth:
I don't know yet... (But I do know they are important to this investigation.) Aha!
Teneiro:
What is it now, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I've found am even more important piece of evidence in this scene!!
Leads back to:
"What is the important piece of evidence in this scene?"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Teneiro:
............ I'm not sure what's so important about that, Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
N-No, wait! (Curses. This is no time to get careless!) Allow me to point it out to you one more time.
Leads back to:
"What is the important piece of evidence in this scene?"
Teneiro:
What is it...?
Edgeworth:
They're a little smudged, but I think we can both agree they are a set of footprints (Spilled grape juice – There is some spilled grape juice on the floor in front of the elevator.).
Teneiro:
So you think...
Edgeworth:
Yes, these belong to our killer.
Teneiro:
Oh, then maybe we should check the shoe sizes of everyone in First Class!
Edgeworth:
I don't think that will be of any help to us. Unfortunately, the prints are too smudged, which will make it hard to get a definitive match.
Teneiro:
Oh, I see...
Grape juice stains (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
Spilled grape juice in a pool at my feet... Unfortunately, the delightful scent of grapes is obscured... ...by the unpleasant smell of the crime scene.
Teneiro:
This scent in the air... It's the same smell as the smell of my towels after they come out of my home dryer.
Edgeworth:
I-I would've never expected something like that by looking at you... (I suppose everyone has something unpleasent about them...)
Table
Edgeworth:
Glasses and candles are thrown into disarray by the turbulence.
Teneiro:
It's been a while since I've seen this big of a mess. It's terribly embarrassing, but I thought it was an earthquake for a second... ...and I frantically started searching for gas values to shut off.
Edgeworth:
It was? (I guess the shaking of the plane was bad enough to be mistaken for a real earthquake. Not that I would know, since I was unconscious for most of it...)
Statue on right
Edgeworth:
A pity that a bronze statue knows not when good drink has been split at its feet.
Teneiro:
This is a statue of our founder, Mr. Hugo Ifly, who was a big fan of grape juice. I'm sure he would be thrilled if he knew so much grape juice was here at his feet.
Edgeworth:
(Is that a hint of hero worshipping I detect...?)
Shutters
Teneiro:
The in-flight shop is just beyond these shutters. But we don't have permission to open them, so I'm afraid I must leave them closed.
Edgeworth:
(There must still be clues to be found here in this lounge! I must remain ever vigilant.)
Examine evidence
Sign on Mr. Ifly Piggy Bank
Edgeworth:
It says "iFly Airlines". You know, I've seen it occur a lot recently, and it's been bothering me greatly... ...but why does nobody know how to properly capitalize and space nouns anymore!?
Bloodstain on Mr. Ifly Piggy Bank
Edgeworth:
There is some blood on one of the corners. Could this piggy bank be the murder weapon?
(Connecting all possible Logic and deduce lanyard continues below)
Investigation Complete
Edgeworth:
(Hm? What's going on over there?)
Lablanc:
Borginese speaking! Borginese speaking!
???:
Borginese speaking... Borginese speaking...
Lablanc:
Unforgivable! This is unforgivable!
???:
.........
Lablanc:
Do you understand what I am saying!? The movie is late! It is the same level of bad as if the plane arrived late!
???:
Ummmmm... But the movie...
Lablanc:
What!? I will not talk to you anymore! You are just wasting my time!
Teneiro:
What is the matter, Mr. Lablanc? If there's no emergency, please return to your seat, sir.
Lablanc:
Do not tell me what to do! I need not to sit down! Well, Mr. Prosecutor!? Did you prove you are innocent yet!?
Edgeworth:
If you would like, I will prove my innocence to you right now.
Lablanc:
What!? Nonsense! Are you saying my eye-witness testimony is mistaken!?
Edgeworth:
Not mistaken, merely that there is room for doubt. I'd be honored if you could please tell me what you saw in detail once more.
Lablanc:
Fine, suit yourself!
-- What I Saw --
Lablanc:
I am certain I saw Mr. Hicks in the elevator!
It was when my needles on my pocket watch pointed to the 6 and to the 12!
The body was discovered 15 minutes after that in the lounge, yes?
Then you, the only person in the lounge at that time, must be the criminal!
Edgeworth:
(Mr. Lablanc's conclusions seem to make logical sense. After all, the only person in the lounge at the supposed time of the murder was me...)
Lablanc:
So! My eye-witness testimony! If you think you can destroy it, then come, let me see! Hurry! Do I look like a man who is having the time to wait for you?
Edgeworth:
(Why is HE so irritated&#160;? I'm the one accused of murder here! Anyway, I must find a way to discredit Mr. Lablanc's account somehow, and fast!)
Rebuttal
-- What I Saw --
Lablanc:
I am certain I saw Mr. Hicks in the elevator!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Lablanc, were you able to get a good look at the inside of the elevator at that time?
Lablanc:
Of course, I saw what was inside.
Edgeworth:
And you are sure that the victim was in the elevator alone?
Lablanc:
Yes! The only person inside was that Mr. Hicks man!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, this last outburst is a bit too important to let go...)
Add statement:
"The only person inside was that Mr. Hicks man!"
Lablanc:
The only person inside was that Mr. Hicks man!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Was he really alone?
Lablanc:
Of course! I will bet even 1 cent!
Edgeworth:
(Hmph, a cheap ante... for a cheap testimony. But if that's how you went to play it, I'll happily take your 1 cent!)
Present Grape Juice Footprints
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. Lablanc."
Lablanc:
It was when my needles on my pocket watch pointed to the 6 and to the 12!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I assume the pocket watch in this case is the one you keep checking, is that correct?
Lablanc:
Oh! You noticed! It is a very expensive antique, I will have you know! The feeling is wonderful when I fully wind it up by hand!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It does look very well designed, and quite classy.
Lablanc:
...I will have to charge you if you want to touch it!
Edgeworth:
......That's quite alright! Let's continue with your testimony.
Lablanc:
Hmph! What a cheap man you are! Now return the time you wasted back to me! And if we must, I saw Mr. Hicks enter the elevator at 6 o'clock!
Lablanc:
The body was discovered 15 minutes after that in the lounge, yes?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
It's true that I found the victim's body at 6:15.
Teneiro:
And that's when I found the two of them as well.
Lablanc:
You see! It all matches my testimony!
Lablanc:
Then you, the only person in the lounge at that time, must be the criminal!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
That is most mistaken way of thinking I've ever heard of!
Hold it!
Lablanc:
No, no, no! Your silly opinion is what is mistaken!
Teneiro:
Please calm down, the both of you. In a sense, you are both mistaken!
Edgeworth:
(Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle back, then I don't know what is.)
Before pressing first statement
Edgeworth:
(He certainly has a lot of confidence in his testimony. If push comes to shove, I may need to press him for more information.)
After pressing first statement
Edgeworth:
(Hmph... I spy a little hole in his words. As you wish, Mr. Lablanc, I will now show you proof of my innocence!)
Edgeworth:
Mr. Lablanc.
Lablanc:
What is it!?
Edgeworth:
There is a very glaring contradiction in your testimony!
Lablanc:
What do you mean!?
Edgeworth:
Please take a look at the area in front of the elevator. There, at the spilled grape juice.
Lablanc:
Yes, and!? Will you admit you also spilled it with the blood!?
Edgeworth:
No, it spilled itself during the turbulence. But the interesting thing here is the set of grape juice footprints.
Lablanc:
F-Footprints!?
Edgeworth:
Yes, the ones that lead from within the elevator out into the lounge itself. It's evidence that proves that someone other than Mr. Hicks exited the elevator, alive!
Lablanc:
Ooooooooonnff!!
Edgeworth:
There must have been another person in the elevator with Mr. Hicks! Now then! I'm done playing games! Why don't you tell us the truth!?
Lablanc:
Borginese speaking! ...Borginese speaking?!
Edgeworth:
............
Teneiro:
Can you please translate for us?
???:
Ummmmmmmmmmm... "No way! That's totally impossible!" I guess is what he said.
Lablanc:
No way! That is totally impossible! I know there was no other person in there! I saw with my own eyes!
Edgeworth:
............
Teneiro:
If you want to know what I think, Mr. Edgeworth... ...I don't think Mr. Lablanc is lying to us.
Edgeworth:
(...I suppose she's right. He doesn't seem to be lying. But then, what does it mean? What about this contradiction?) Mr. Lablanc. Please, just once call more, will you recall the details of what you witnessed for me?
Lablanc:
Mnnnnrgh!
-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --
Lablanc:
I was very upset when Mr. Hicks passed by my seat.
I was checking the time, over and over again.
I happened to follow that man with my eyes when he passed me.
And I saw clearly into the elevator he was entering.
But, I swear there was no one else inside! No one!
Teneiro:
Mr. Lablanc, if you would please calm down...
Lablanc:
What!? Dare you too have an issue with my eye-witness testimony!?
Teneiro:
Aaaaah! N-No, not at all! Please forget I said anything!
Edgeworth:
(Yet again, he doesn't appear to be lying. But I can't let this testimony stand as the truth!)
Rebuttal
-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --
Lablanc:
I was very upset when Mr. Hicks passed by my seat.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, are you still upset now?
Lablanc:
I am always upset! The only time I am not is when I have a piece of art in my hands!
Edgeworth:
(It's surprisingly easy to believe that about him.)
Lablanc:
But I was even more upset when Mr. Hicks walked by me!
Lablanc:
I was checking the time, over and over again.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Why were you so attentive to the time?
Lablanc:
Because! Because something unforgivable was happening!
Edgeworth:
Hmm, come to think of it, you were yelling about something "unforgivable" earlier...
Lablanc:
I was giving a complaint to the attendant about the movie starting time! Return back to me my time!! In money!! ...You understand the point.
Edgeworth:
(Movie? Is he talking about the in-flight one that's mentioned in the magazine? Hmm... A summary of the plot and the start time... Interesting...)
Lablanc:
They were supposed to show "License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder". I cannot see that movie in my country. You can only see it on international flights. I looked forward greatly to that movie!! I checked my pocket watch whenever possible so I would not miss it! I even set my pocket watch to the destination time when I came onboard. So my watch is not wrong! It matched the schedule! But the movie was still late! Very, very late!
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Your pocket watch... I'd like to ask you a little more about it, if that's alright.
Change this statement to:
"The movie I wanted to see would not start, so I checked my pocket watch many times." and "My watch is set to my destination's time. I always set it when I board the plane."
Lablanc:
The movie I wanted to see would not start, so I checked my pocket watch many times.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So this movie you mentioned, is it the one listed in the Sky Magazine?
Lablanc:
Yes! I was so looking forward to watching "License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder"!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro, was this movie shown on this flight?
Teneiro:
Yes, it was shown at the scheduled time...
Edgeworth:
...Isn't it possible you simply slept through it by accident?
Lablanc:
Nonsense! You doubt me!?
Edgeworth:
N-No! Now stop pointing at me like that! (Odd. How did he miss a movie that he was clearly hoping to see...?)
Lablanc:
I checked my pocket watch a great number of times! That much I know for sure!
Lablanc:
My watch is set to my destination's time. I always set it when I board the plane.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You're sure about what you just testified, Mr. Lablanc?
Lablanc:
Yes, of course! I am a very busy man! I am immediately busy when I land! I have many places to go! And no time to waste adjusting my pocket watch!
Edgeworth:
I see... That was a very valuable statement you just made.
Lablanc:
Hmph! Flatter me all you want, but you will not get 1 cent out of me!
Edgeworth:
Um... That's alright. All I require is this piece of testimony.
Present Sky Magazine
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. Lablanc, you said this just now in your testimony:"
Lablanc:
I happened to follow that man with my eyes when he passed me.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Since you only "happened" to see him, it's possible that you missed something in that glance!
Hold it!
Lablanc:
Even if I only "happened", I did not miss a thing!
Edgeworth:
And how can you be so sure?
Lablanc:
Just because!
Edgeworth:
I would appreciate it if you didn't take my life so lightly with a simple, "Just because!"
Lablanc:
Hmph! Well, then I was only making a joke! I saw Mr. Hicks, alright?
Lablanc:
And I saw clearly into the elevator he was entering.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Is it possible that someone was hiding inside?
Lablanc:
What!? You dare insult me!? I have belief in my eyesight! When I look for art to sell, I am told often I have "great sight" for the arts.
Edgeworth:
(I think the phrase you were looking for was "great sense", although that's debatable.) But isn't it possible someone was just outside of your line of sight...?
Lablanc:
You are persistent! I tell you, I looked clearly!
Lablanc:
But, I swear there was no one else inside! No one!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Why do you insist that you are absolutely not mistaken!?
Lablanc:
Because when I say I am not wrong, I am not wrong!
Teneiro:
Mr. Lablanc, if I may, I think beyond misconceptions and mistake lies the truth.
Edgeworth:
(Funny, that suspiciously mirrors something I told her only a little while ago.)
Before pressing second statement
Edgeworth:
 (Mr. Lablanc doesn't seem to be lying... I may need to draw more information out of him before I see anything inconsistent.)
After pressing second statement
Teneiro:
I honestly don't think Mr. Lablanc is lying...
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I don't think he's lying either. But... I think he might be mistaken about something.
Teneiro:
Mistaken...?
Edgeworth:
Yes. And I'm going to correct his mistaken recollection with evidence.
Teneiro:
And this professional attendant  shall witness the prowess of a professional prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Lablanc, you said this just now in your testimony:
Lablanc:
I even set my pocket watch to the destination time when I came onboard.
Edgeworth:
Now, if your watch has been set to our destination's time zone... ...it would mean that your watch is displaying the time of our destination.
Lablanc:
Yes, and? The correct time is worth its 6 cents.
Edgeworth:
I would like you to take a look at this. If you believe this Sky Magazine... ...clocks on this flight run in accordance with the time of our departure time zone! Of course, the movie schedule was also created with that in mind. Ms. Teneiro, for confirmation's sake, what time zone is this flight aligned to right now?
Teneiro:
Well, we made a short stop at a transfer point.
Edgeworth:
(That's right. It was in that small Asian country, the Republic of Zheng Fa...)
Teneiro:
But we didn't re-adjust our onboard clocks at that time. So right now, we are still running on Borginian time!
Lablanc:
What!?
Edgeworth:
The time difference between Borginia and out destination is 9 hours. In that case, it's only natural that your watch would be out of sync with the schedule!
Lablanc:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?
Edgeworth:
Further, with your analog watch set to our destination's time... ...it would appear to be running 3 hours fast when compared to the flight's onboard clocks. It also changes everything about your testimony. And you can bet 1 million cents on that! In light of this information, it means you saw Mr. Hicks 3 hours prior at 3 AM!
Lablanc:
Nnnnn...ggggggwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! My 1 miiiiiiiiiiiiiiillion ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeents!!!
Edgeworth:
(This should clear up all of the remaining accusations...)
Teneiro:
So this basically widens the time frame for the time of death, right...?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Because Mr. Lablanc saw the victim enter the elevator at 3 AM... ...it means that the time of death could be anywhere from 3 to 6:15 AM. That question now is where was Mr. Hicks during that span of time and what was he doing?
???:
Um, I've got something to say.
Edgeworth:
And you are...?
Meele:
Yeah, um... Oh! I'm Cammy Meele. I'm a flight attendant.
Edgeworth:
And what is it you wish to say?
Meele:
Well, I think your story is a little different from how I remember it.
Teneiro:
What do you mean, Cammy?
Meele:
I saw Mr. Hicks sitting in his seat at 5 AM, you know.
Edgeworth:
What? How can you be so sure of the time?
Teneiro:
Oh, that's right! He pushed his call button while we were parked at the transfer point.
Edgeworth:
Ah, the stop we made for refueling and cargo transfer in Zheng Fa, correct?
Teneiro:
Yes, it was from 4 to 5 AM according to our clocks.
Edgeworth:
And during that time, did any of passengers leave or did any new ones board this flight?
Teneiro:
No. Not a single person got off or on in Zheng Fa.
Edgeworth:
What about the flight crew?
Teneiro:
The few who were handling the cargo transfer might have temporarily gotten on or off... ...but eventually everyone, including Cammy and myself, came back on the plane.
Edgeworth:
(So basically, I can assume that no one left or got on since our initial take off. Interesting... I should keep that in mind.)
Refueling in Zheng Fa data jotted down in my Organizer.
Meele:
Yeah, and I answered his call. I can tell you Mr. Akbey Hicks was there in his seat when we took off again at 5 AM.
Ms. Meele's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Alright, then that puts the time of the murder between 5 and 6:15 AM.
Meele:
OK, now what time did you come down to the lounge, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Hmm, I remember coming down here almost as soon as we left the Republic of Zheng Fa... Aaah!
Lablanc:
You! You were here the whole time from 5, yes!? Then you are the only one who could be the killer!
Teneiro:
Mr. Edgeworth... Were you really here in this lounge the entire time from 5 AM onwards?
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, yes.
Teneiro:
But then, how do we explain the footprints?
Lablanc:
Is not that obvious!? This man waited for Mr. Hicks here in this lounge. Waited to kill him! And then he put the corpse into the elevator! That is when the turbulence happened! My eye-witness testimony may have been mistaken! But what time I saw Mr. Hicks enter the elevator on the second floor does not matter! Because the entire incident concluded here in this lounge!
Edgeworth:
(Everything happened in this lounge...?) Is that what you really believe, Mr. Lablanc?
Lablanc:
Wh...!? Do you have another idea!?
Edgeworth:
I simply feel that there is something out of place in the scenario you presented. (Is there something that can tie this crime to a location other than this lounge?)
Present Mr. Ifly Piggy Bank
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The murder weapon... This little piggy bank is sold at the in-flight shop."
Present Grape Juice Footprints
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
These footprints. In which direction do you think these are headed?
Teneiro:
That would be... the in-flight shop.
Edgeworth:
Correct. They are headed in the direction of the shop.
Lablanc:
But they look disconnected! They end all of a sudden!
Edgeworth:
You are right to point out that they do not from one continuous trail to the shop. However, there is another piece of evidence that connects the shop to our crime scene. (Besides the footprints, what else points to the in-flight shop?)
Present Mr. Ifly Piggy Bank
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The murder weapon... This little piggy bank is sold at the in-flight shop."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Lablanc:
Hmph! I don't need to hear your wild desperation stories! "Grasping for weeds" I think is how you say it, yes!?
Edgeworth:
Agnrk...... I didn't mean to pull that piece out! The one that I meant to show you was...
Leads back to:
"(Besides the footprints, what else points to the in-flight shop?)"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Lablanc:
Hmph! I don't need to hear your wild desperation stories! "Grasping for weeds" I think is how you say it, yes!?
Edgeworth:
Agnrk...... I didn't mean to pull that piece out! I was a simple slip of the hand, I assure you!
Leads back to:
"(Is there something that can tie this crime to a location other than this lounge?)"
Edgeworth:
The murder weapon... This little piggy bank is sold at the in-flight shop. It is sold there and only there, and is not displayed here in this lounge! How, then, did it find its way here? Don't you find that a tiny bit suspicious?
Lablanc:
Hmph! Such a trivial point! It only means you prepared it, taking it from the shop first before coming here. It doesn't prove you are innocent at all!
Edgeworth:
Nnnrrrgh......... (Is there no way to win with this man!?)
Hold it!
Teneiro:
I-If I may...!
Lablanc:
What is it!?
Teneiro:
Um... You see...! Well, it's just as Mr. Edgeworth says!
Lablanc:
Oh? And why do you know so well?
Teneiro:
Well... it's just that... That piggy bank was there in the shop. I saw it with my own eyes.
Edgeworth:
And when was this?
Teneiro:
It was... maybe around 5:40 AM...?
Edgeworth:
...Isn't that just before we hit that patch of turbulence!?
Teneiro:
Th-That's right...
Lablanc:
You were in the shop just before the turbulence!?
Teneiro:
Um............ Yes, I was.
Edgeworth:
Come to think of it... Ms. Teneiro, when I found the body... ...I believe you came out of that door.
Teneiro:
Yes, I did...
Edgeworth:
And what is beyond that door?
Teneiro:
That's the flight attendants' room.
Lablanc:
Th-Then! You were on the first floor!?
Teneiro:
Yes... I had to do something at the shop and in the flight attendants' room. So I went to the shop first, and then to the flight attendant's room.
Edgeworth:
Are you saying you passed by me at some point?
Teneiro:
Yes. You seemed really into the issue of Sky Magazine you were reading at the time. I don't suppose you noticed me walking by...
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, I vaguely recall someone walking by, but I didn't take notice of who it was.)
Teneiro:
Anyway! The piggy bank was definitely there at the shop when I went there.
Lablanc:
Why did you go to the shop in the first place?
Teneiro:
I... went there for a work-related matter.
Lablanc:
Work, you say?
Teneiro:
Yes... The upkeep of the shop is also one of my responsibilities.
Lablanc:
Why did you not say anything about that until now is what I want to know.
Teneiro:
.........
Edgeworth:
In any case, I believe it's clear that the shop needs to be investigated as well.
Teneiro:
Shall we head over there, then?
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What is it now!?
Meele:
Aren't you forgetting something, Ms. Rhoda...? Don't you need the captain's permission to check the shop?
Teneiro:
No, I haven't forgotten. But I have already asked him for permission to search the entire plane. So I think we're alright.
Meele:
Huh...? That's weird...
Edgeworth:
What is?
Meele:
Well, I just talked to the captain, see... ...and he said that he didn't give you permission to do anything like that at all.
Teneiro:
!
Edgeworth:
What is the meaning of this, Ms. Teneiro!?
Meele:
It means she's lying. Go on, admit that you are. You said you had permission to search all over, but you don't. And yet, here you are!
Teneiro:
.........
Lablanc:
...You, flight attendant! Wh-What are you trying to do!? Pull the sheep over us!?
Meele:
The captain's calling for you, Ms. Rhoda. Oh, but don't worry... I already got permission to search the shop from the captain. See, unlike you, I do things the right way.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro... Why would you do such a thing?
Teneiro:
.........Please excuse me.
Meele:
Looks like I get to be in charge now. Please go back to your seat, Mr. Lablanc. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth... ...if you would follow me, I will be your guide from now on.
Edgeworth:
(There's something about Ms. Teneiro that has piqued my curiosity. But right now, investigating the in-flight shop is my top priority.)
Stair to second floor
Meele:
Um.. .Weren't we going to go to the in-flight shop?
Edgeworth:
Of course. I still fully intend it.
Meele:
OK, well, the shop is over there. Don't forget now.
Blue door
Meele:
Mr. Edgeworth! That's the attendants' room!
Edgeworth:
Ah, please excuse me. It was a simple mistake.
Meele:
You made a mistake, didn't you!? Why don't you just come out and say it?
Edgeworth:
That's exactly what I just said. I made a small mistake.
Meele:
............
Edgeworth:
Don't nod off while I'm talking!
Glasses
Edgeworth:
(These bottles and glasses must have been broken by the turbulence.) There is quite a bit of broken glass here. Please be careful when passing through the area.
Meele:
............ Huh? Did you say something?
Edgeworth:
I said that there is glass here, and to be careful...
Meele:
............ But why?
Edgeworth:
(Obviously, common sense does not register, even as a blip, on this girl's radar!)
Piano
Edgeworth:
(A piano... It's been a while since I played one of these. It might not be a bad idea to brush up a bit after all this time. Of course, that's contingent on the outcome of this case! It's time to get investigating!)
Cammy Meele
Edgeworth:
Ms. Meele! About investigating the in-flight shop...
Meele:
............
Edgeworth:
You're of no use to me asleep! Wake up!
Meele:
*yawn* Huh? What's up?
Edgeworth:
I-I need you to come with me so I can search the shop...
Meele:
Go on ahead without me. *yawn* I'll catch up with you later.
Edgeworth:
(How has this woman not been fired yet?)
Zinc Lablanc II
Lablanc:
Ooooooh, I am really mad! You had better hurry and bring to me some evidence!
Edgeworth:
If you could wait just a little longer while we look into the shop...
Lablanc:
Hmph! Don't number the birds before they are born!
Edgeworth:
(Don't number the... What...? I have no idea what he's trying to say. "Don't count your chicken before they hatch" perhaps...?) All I ask of you is your patience and cooperation.
Windows
Edgeworth:
(These counter windows offer a glimpse of the sky, but these clouds, they tell me nothing... Ack! Now's not the time for me to stand here making up soliloquies!)
Magazines
Edgeworth:
There are a few copies of Sky Magazine in the magazine rack. The special this month is an English trivia quiz. Of course, I have never uttered a single grammatically incorrect sentence in my life.
Lablanc:
What is it!? Why are you looking at me for? Hurry and go do your investigating! I do not believe in this "making haste slowly" saying you have in English!
Statue on left
Edgeworth:
There's something written on the pedestal... "Here lies Hugo Ifly" ............? I don't think that's what they meant to write...
Toppled-over chair
Edgeworth:
(This toppled-over chair... Yet another victim of the turbulence.) There's something written on the back: "In honor of Rocker Pals' Day"...? I have the distinct impression that this chair has nothing to do with the case.
Body
Edgeworth:
(I've already finished examining this area, but it never hurts to look again.)
Floor
Edgeworth:
(There is money strewn all over the floor of the elevator. I guess this was all in Mr. Hicks's wallet before the incident...)
Body
Edgeworth:
I doubt anyone was expecting to find a dead body in an elevator on this flight. For the victim's sake, I will do anything in my power to bring this to a speedy end.
Pocket
Edgeworth:
It looks like there was just the one picture in this pocket.
Figure
Edgeworth:
The Mr. Ifly here was probably used to hit the victim on the back of the head.
Grape juice stains
Edgeworth:
Considering which way these prints are pointed, it's likely the killer went into the shop. I should really make my way over there now.
Table
Edgeworth:
Glasses and candles are thrown into disarray by the turbulence. Seeing this reminds me of the ferocity of that last patch. And of... ...No, I can't do this anymore. I've overcome that already. I won't let past traumas control me for the rest of my life.
Statue on right
Edgeworth:
A pity that a bronze statue knows not when good drink has been split at its feet. Odd... Compared to the one on the left, this statue appears to be slouching a little. ...It must be the altitude. Yes, that's it.
March 12, 8:32 AMFlight I-390, First FloorIn-Flight Shop
Edgeworth:
(So this is the in-flight shop...) It's a quite mess in here...
Meele:
You think? Guess I'll have to clean things up then, tee hee.
Edgeworth:
Hold on! You can't "clean up" a potential crime scene!
Meele:
Ohhh, thank goodness! I hate cleaning soooo much.
Edgeworth:
(I mustn't rush things here. I must remain cool, calm and collected. Because this piggy bank (Murder Weapon: Mr. Ifly - The blood on it is still fresh... Could this be the murder weapon?) was left at the crime scene... ...there is a very good chance that the killer had paid this place a visit.)
Begin Investigation
In-Flight Shop
Logic
"Tiny captain's hat" and "Murder weapon: Mr. Ifly"
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... The hat probably used to be on the piggy bank's head. Let's give it a go and see...) I believe this piggy bank was forcibly removed from this display case. (Does this mean that the killer broke the glass to get at it...?)
Mr. Ifly Piggy Bank data updated in my Organizer.
Meele:
Eeeeeehhhh? Really?
Edgeworth:
Don't tell me you don't know what things go where in this shop.
Meele:
Well, I don't! Ms. Rhoda's in charge of this place. So, come on, how should I know anything?
Edgeworth:
(I sense that further inspection of this display case is needed.)
Meele:
Well? What do you think, Mr. Edgeworth? Don't you think that's worth investigating?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It would appear that this figurine is our murder weapon.
Meele:
Oh, I just knew it! I mean, I can't think of any other connection!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, perhaps Master of the Oblivious would be more befitting...)
"Suitcase" and "Turbulence"
Leads to:
"Yes... There is definitely something wrong here!"
Cammy Meele
Meele:
I don't know much about this shop, but you can still ask me about whatever.
Notice anything?
Edgeworth:
So what do you think about what has happened regarding this case?
Meele:
Oh, I don't know. I guess I think you're the killer, though, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
I can assure you that I'm here in this shop to prove just the opposite...!
Meele:
Yeah, but it was me that got you the permission to look around, you know. So don't forget that, OK?
Edgeworth:
How am I supposed to thank you properly if you insist on falling asleep!?
Meele:
Well, you know what'd really show your thanks? You see that item for sale over there?
Edgeworth:
Sorry, but you're going to have to make due with my words of appreciation.
About the shop (appears after examining broken glass in Broken Display Case, before deduce)
Meele:
I cut my finger on those bad pieces of glass.
Edgeworth:
Don't blame the glass for something you did to yourself. Just be more careful.
Meele:
Same to you! You're the one walking all over broken glass. You sure you're OK?
Edgeworth:
I'm fine. Any glass I walk on, I crush... like this!
Meele:
That's nice. Please be careful around the display case, OK? Wouldn't want you to get hurt.
Edgeworth:
Compared to the glass around my feet, the inside of the case is nothing to be afraid of. After all, no glass fragments appear to have ended up inside.
Meele:
Then I guess even you can tidy up the case, right?
Edgeworth:
Perish the thought!
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Meele:
Ooh, I'd love to have this piece of jewelry. Can I have it?
Edgeworth:
N-No, you may not! This is a Prosecutor's Badge...
Meele:
Pooey. Then why did you show it to me?
Edgeworth:
I wanted to prove to you that I really am a prosecutor. And that it's not possible for a prosecutor like me to commit such a crime as...
Meele:
..................
Edgeworth:
(I see that I'm just watching my time with Cousin Hair here.)
Mr. Ifly Piggy Bank
Meele:
Ms. Rhoda said that this piggy bank was in this shop, right? Don't you find her a tiiiny bit suspicious?
Edgeworth:
I don't think I can say either way yet. There's not enough evidence to convince me that she was lying about anything back there.
Meele:
Are you sure about that...?
Refueling in Zheng Fa
Meele:
Like I said earlier... ...I was the one answering people's calls while we were refueling in Zheng Fa. And Mr. Hicks was in his seat at the time.
Edgeworth:
What time was that again?
Meele:
He called at around 5 AM. You were at your seat around then too, you know.
Edgeworth:
I do recall people calling for service at around that time. (Even if this turns out to be a waste of time, I must stand firm. I just know that there is a vital clue ot two awaiting me here in this shop.)
Anything else
Meele:
So what is that? Are you going to give it to me? Oh, but I'm not supposed to accept any presents. ...Unless they're really worth something.
Flowers
Edgeworth:
Beautiful flowers in a beautiful arrangement. (I feel cleansed just by looking at them...)
Meele:
Mr. Edgeworth, you're getting pollen all over.
Edgeworth:
Oh... Excuse me.
Display case on down left
Edgeworth:
Inside this display case is a row of lifesavers and life vests for sale.
Meele:
We sell a lot of those when there's some kind of accident or something. But some people buy them even when nothing's going on. How about it, Mr. Edgeworth? Care to buy one?
Edgeworth:
(I sense that this shop is one shopper away from being sued.)
Suitcases
Edgeworth:
Wh-What are these...?
Meele:
Oh, those are our company's completely original line of suitcases! They're practically flying out the door! That's how popular they are! You should buy one and see how you like it! You won't regret it!
Edgeworth:
Perhaps that's how things work on this flight, but in the real world you try, then buy.
Meele:
No way! But either way, it doesn't really matter.
Edgeworth:
(True. Either way, why would anyone buy a suitcase AFTER they've boarded the plane?)
Meele:
Anyway, see that? Just look at all the Mr. Ifly heads painted on there! Cute company mascot, isn't he!? They're painted on with a lot of care. Doesn't he look like he's about to jump out at you?
Edgeworth:
...It is certainly making something jump inside my stomach!
Meele:
Huh...? Oh, I guess there's no fooling your refined tastes!
Edgeworth:
?
Meele:
You looked like you really wanted to get one... ...and I thought I was going to finally make my first sale, but you saw right through it. Glad that's done though. Never make me try to give you a sales pitch ever again, OK?
Edgeworth:
But I never showed any interest in it to begin with!
Meele:
Tee hee! It really is pretty horrible, isn't it? You want to know something? This suitcase was designed by Ms. Rhoda!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro designed this?
Meele:
Yeah. It was a company-wide contest.
Edgeworth:
Um, well... It does have a very sharp design sense.
Meele:
Ha ha, "sharp"? Like stinky sharp cheddar, maybe. I really have no idea why the big wigs decided to go with it. It's so... bleh.
Edgeworth:
(Ms. Teneiro designed this, did she? ...It's definitely not what I would've expected...) Aaaaaaaaah!
Meele:
You OK!?
Edgeworth:
I-I'm fine! Please watch yourself, Ms. Meele! (Letting a suitcase (Suitcase - Plane's shaking caused it to roll. In-flight suitcase displays can be hazardous.) freely roll around has got to be a safety violation...)
Meele:
Here, I'll put it back.
Suitcases (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
(Suitcases designed by Ms. Teneiro... That's one sharp design.)
Display case on up
Edgeworth:
There is a wide selection of souvenirs for sale in these display cases.
Meele:
You know what I'd suggest...?
Edgeworth:
Sorry, but I have no intention of buying souvenirs on this trip.
Meele:
OK, then how about you buy something for me then? As a present!
Edgeworth:
I can't think of a single reason why I'd want to buy you anything.
Meele:
But I've had my eye on that pendant for such a loooong time.
Edgeworth:
Try paying some attention to me when I ask you something, and then we'll talk.
Display case on down right
Edgeworth:
(There are all kinds of luxury name-brand merchandise for sale in this display case. And they're lined up in just such a manner as to scream, "Buy me!" to any passers-by.)
Broken display case
Edgeworth:
(The glass from this display case's door is shattered all over the floor. And it looks like there's nothing on display inside either. Hmm? Wait, actually, I think there is something... What's this...? A mini captain's hat (Tiny Captain's Hat - It's a tiny captain's hat...? Hmm... I swear I've seen one of these before...)...?)
Meele:
We sell a lot of those when there's some kind of accident or something. But some people buy them even when nothing's going on. How about it, Mr. Edgeworth? Care to buy one?
Edgeworth:
(I sense that this shop is one shopper away from being sued.)
Broken display case (after connecting Mr. Ifly Logic)
Before deduce
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After deduce
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Display case on left
Edgeworth:
Is this the same man as the one portrayed by the statues around the elevator?
Meele:
Yeah, that's a paperweight of the founder of iFly Airlines, Mr. Hugo Ifly. On the bottom shelf we have the cute one, the middle shelf is the realistic one... ...and on the top shelf......... That's the floral version.
Edgeworth:
F-Floral...? Are you sure about that? Let me guess. You just said the first thing that came to your mind, right?
Meele:
............
Edgeworth:
(Looks I hit the bull's-eye.)
Broken display case
Edgeworth:
(The glass on this door is broken... Perhaps it was the killer who broke it in order to take the piggy bank? But it's a bit odd that the inside of the case is so devoid of glass shards. Plus, the glass broke rather cleanly...)
Meele:
Aaaaaaaah!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What is it!?
Meele:
I... I touched the glass, and it cut my finger!
Edgeworth:
.........
Meele:
It hurts, Mr. Edgeworth! It hurts!
Edgeworth:
...Please tell me you can deal with such a minor cut on your own!
Broken display case (after deduce)
Edgeworth:
There's not a single piece of glass inside the display case. Which means that the glass was broken from the inside out. The piggy bank must've fallen over from the turbulence and right through the glass. Which leads me to believe that the killer took the Mr. Ifly from here after the turbulence. (But that would also mean that the piggy bank could not be the murder weapon...)
Locks
Edgeworth:
(For security, there's a lock on this display case.) Ms. Meele, if I may ask you about this lock...
Meele:
Ummm... The one who's in charge of this shop is Ms. Rhoda, so... ...she's got the keys to all of the display cases.
Edgeworth:
I see...
Meele:
Oh! I bet you want to buy something! Do you want me to go get the key from her?
Edgeworth:
No, t-that's alright...
Books
Edgeworth:
iFly Airlines related books line this shelf. "The History of iFly Airlines" "The Future of iFly Airlines" "The Seven Wonders of iFly" "Fight On! iFly Airlines" "Working Name: GoYou Airlines" "i♥Fly-----------ing" The titles make it very clear that they won't be making the top-sellers list anytime soon.
Deduce
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce empty shelf and Present Mr. iFly Piggy Bank
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"There is definitely something very unusual about this!"
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Meele:
Do you need something?
Edgeworth:
Th-This piece of evidence is...
Meele:
Is...?
Edgeworth:
No, nevermind. Temporary lapse. (I'm thinking too hard about when the glass broke. It's simple... What was here when the glass broke...?)
Edgeworth:
There is definitely something very unusual about this!
Meele:
About what?
Edgeworth:
If the killer had broken the glass to get at the Mr. Ifly bank... ...there should be shards of glass inside the case itself.
Meele:
Ooooooh, I see! Yeah, I guess it'd be like that!
Edgeworth:
However, there's not a single piece of glass inside the display case.
Meele:
Nope! No, there isn't!
Edgeworth:
Which means that the glass was broken from the inside out. The piggy bank must've fallen over from the turbulence and right through the glass.
Meele:
Yeah, that's for sure There's so much glass all over the floor.
Edgeworth:
I'm willing to bet that this hat was knocked off its head at that time, too.
Meele:
.........Eh!? ......That's nice.
Edgeworth:
Which leads me to believe... ...that the killer took the Mr. Ifly from here after the turbulence (Turbulence - The plane shook so much during it that it made a huge mess of the shop.)!
Mr. Ifly Piggy Bank data updated in my Organizer.
Meele:
..................zzz.
Edgeworth:
Take your power naps on your own time, Ms. Meele, and listen when I'm talking!
Meele:
Wah!
Edgeworth:
But the murder occurred before the turbulence... ...which rules this piggy bank out as the murder weapon.
Meele:
So you mean the bank's not the real murder weapon? It's a fake?
Edgeworth:
Yes, at this point, that is a very real possibility.
Meele:
Um, but then what if when the killer went to take Mr. Ifly... ...they broke the glass by accident?
Edgeworth:
The display case is locked, so that's highly unlikely.
Meele:
...Yeah, but there's one person who could've.
Edgeworth:
Oh? And who would that be?
Meele:
Ms. Rhoda, of course. I mean, she's the one in charge of this place, so she has the keys to everything.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Rhoda Teneiro, huh...
Stuffed toys
Edgeworth:
Stuffed toys, just like the one Ms. Meele is holding, are on display here. (They're relatively cheap, which explains why they're displayed so hapazardly...)
Meele:
How about it, Mr. Edgeworth? You know you want one, too. They're great for when you're stressed.
Edgeworth:
(Why do I envision stuffed animal abuse when she says that...?)
Examine evidence
Hat on Mr. Ifly Piggy Bank
Edgeworth:
The hat on its head was found inside a display case in the in-flight shop. I wonder if that fact has any bearing on this case...?
Edgeworth:
Yes... There is definitely something wrong here!
Meele:
Wh-What's with the sudden yelling!?
Edgeworth:
Tell me, Ms. Meele, don't you think there's something strange about there suitcases?
Meele:
Oh, well, sure... They totally ooze "strange". Like the color and the such...
Edgeworth:
That's not what I'm talking now! Now pay attention!
Meele:
Aaah! You're scaring me, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
S-Sorry... Ahem. These suitcases are lined up a bit too prim and proper.
Meele:
Yeah, they look a bit uptight, don't they? But I guess they take after their creator, hee hee!
Edgeworth:
Again, that's not what I meant, Ms. Meele. Don't you find it unusual that these cases are the only things undisturbed by the turbulence? (...Never mind. I'd sooner find an answer by inspecting these suitcases myself.) Upon closer inspection, they really are quite hideous.
Meele:
Tee hee... I wonder how Ms. Rhoda would've reacted if she'd heard what you just said.
Edgeworth:
.........
Meele:
What's wrong?
Edgeworth:
(...She makes a good point. It would be wise of me to watch what I say out loud.) What's this? I've spotted something that's not quite right... (What is so unusual about this suitcase?)
Present wheel of left suitcase
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"There's something very peculiar about these wheels."
Present suitcases
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Meele:
Yeah, I figured you thought the design was odd, too.
Edgeworth:
I never said the design was odd...!
Meele:
Yeah, yeah...
Edgeworth:
Please don't give me that attitude! (Argh! I can't let her get me all riled up. Time to calmly take another good, hard look.)
Leads back to:
"(What is so unusual about this suitcase?)"
Present price tag of suitcase
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Meele:
Yeah, no matter how you cut it, the price is a bit odd, isn't it?
Edgeworth:
Th-That wasn't what I was pointing out to be odd... (The answer should come to me if I think back on all that has happened here!)
Leads back to:
"(What is so unusual about this suitcase?)"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is what so odd!
Meele:
I don't think it's that strange at all.
Edgeworth:
W-Well, maybe not to that extent... ahem. (I mustn't over-think this. I should let the answer come to me.)
Leads back to:
"(What is so unusual about this suitcase?)"
Edgeworth:
There's something very peculiar about these wheels.
Meele:
Huh? As in?
Edgeworth:
As in... ...there are no stoppers in place on these. Without stoppers, one would think that the turbulence would have sent it flying.
Meele:
...And?
Edgeworth:
*sigh* And so, it is very likely that this suitcase was placed here after we hit that turbulence! Let's take a closer look at it, shall we?
Examine front side of suitcase
Edgeworth:
This was apparently designed by Ms. Teneiro herself. The design has a certain... je ne sais quoi about it. Yes... Perhaps that is the best way to put it...
Examine price tag
Edgeworth:
A $1,200 price tag... Not exactly priced by someone with a conscience, I'd say.
Examine wheel on up right
Edgeworth:
(What's this? The wheel is completely covered in something... This color and this scent... It appears the substance in question is grape juice. But why would there be juice on the wheel of a suitcase?)
Examine lock
Leads to:
"Hmm, it would appear to be unlocked. Let's take a look at what's inside."
Edgeworth:
Hmm, it would appear to be unlocked. Let's take a look at what's inside. A piece of cloth... ...And it's soaked with blood!
Meele:
Aaaaah! It's... It's blood!
Edgeworth:
It appears that this suitcase... ...is very strongly tied to our murder after all!
Investigation Complete
Meele:
So explain this to me...? What does this suitcase have to do with the murder?
Edgeworth:
I believe it's pretty safe to say that the killer used this suitcase in some manner. Such as to move something perhaps?
Meele:
Ehhhh... But aren't you just talking about the cloth then?
Edgeworth:
That alone is too small. A larger item would be needed to move what I'm thinking of. The "thing" I believe the killer used this suitcase to transport is...
Present Crime Scene Notes
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Something that would fit inside a suitcase that is also covered in blood..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Meele:
............
Edgeworth:
Ms. Meele! Wake up!
Meele:
Huh? Did you say something just now, Mr. Edgeworth? I mean, I don't know... but I don't think that's it...
Edgeworth:
Oh, this? No, no, I was just seeing if you were awake. My real explanation begins now.
Meele:
............
Edgeworth:
(Is she really asleep...?)
Leads back to:
"The "thing" I believe the killer used this suitcase to transport is..."
Edgeworth:
Something that would fit inside a suitcase that is also covered in blood... Sounds like a dead body, doesn't it?
iFly Suitcase data jotted down in my Organizer.
Bloody Cloth data jotted down in my Organizer.
Meele:
But... But...
Examine evidence
Bloody cloth in iFly Suitcase
Edgeworth:
This cloth was most likely in here with the body... Just what was this suitcase used for?
Blood in corner inside iFly Suitcase
Edgeworth:
Why would there be blood inside a suitcase like this...?
Blood on Bloody Cloth
Edgeworth:
For there to be this much blood on this piece of cloth... Was the victim wrapped in it at some point? Hmm... There's something very familiar sbout this fabric pattern...
Edgeworth:
In light of this, I'd say that Mr. Hicks was moved into the elevator from someplace else. Which means that the murder was committed in an entirely different location!
Meele:
......... So you're saying that after moving the body into the elevator... ...the killer brought the suitcase in here and just left it?
Edgeworth:
Exactly.
Meele:
.........
Edgeworth:
What is it?
Meele:
Um, nothing... Just that... ...I was thinking about what Ms. Rhoda said about coming here for something...
Edgeworth:
!
Teneiro:
Excuse me, Mr. Edgeworth... I wanted to give you a bit more time... ...but I'm afraid I wasn't able to convince the captain. I'm very sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. but the captain feels that he has allowed you ample time. He says that he'd appreciate it if you could wrap it up here and return to your seat.
Edgeworth:
I understand his sentiments, however, if I'm not allowed to complete my investigation... ...the crime scene may become contaminated by the time we land. If I must stop, then I insist I be allowed to oversee the preservation of the two sites. ...Under your supervision, of course.
Teneiro:
If that's your only condition, then I believe we can accommodate your wishes. I'm here to assist you in any way that I can, Mr. Edgeworth.
Meele:
Sounds like fun! We can camp out and watch over everything together!
Edgeworth:
(I've found proof that the real crime scene was not in the lounge... ...and I have enough evidence to prove myself to be innocent of any wrongdoing... And yet... Regarding that Ms. Meele reminded me about Ms. Teneiro... I can't allow my investigation to end here! The truth must come to light!)
To be continued.
March 12, 1:00 PMHope Springs Airport
Edgeworth:
(I know that once we had landed... ...I'm supposed to let the local police take over... And thanks to Ms. Teneiro and Ms. Meele, I was able to preserve the crime scene... But I just can't shake it. I wasn't able to talk with Ms. Teneiro in private... ...so I'm left wondering just what was she up to? Why did she do what she did? There must be a way for me to continue my investigation.)
???:
I've been expecting you, Miles Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Franziska? I thought you were still in Germany...
Franziska:
I go where I am needed. And wherever there are criminals to be caught.
Edgeworth:
(Her name is Franziska von Karma. The daughter of my mentor, Manfred von Karma, she, like myself, is a prosecutor.) Are you heading up this case? It would be a bit of a relief if you are...
Franziska:
Don't you try to flatter me! Miles Edgeworth... I'm placing you under arrest.
Edgeworth:
Wh-What!?
Franziska:
It's quite frustrating, actually. I had hoped to exact my revenge on you in a different venue... ...but I'll have to take what I can get. I never thought I'd see the day... ...when a disciple of the house of Von Karma would become a criminal! Have you no shame!?
Edgeworth:
Wait! It has all been a big misunderstanding! I didn't kill the victim!
Franziska:
A misunderstanding!? I heard all about the murder over the police radio from the captain himself. You waited for the victim on the first floor, and then beat him to death.
Edgeworth:
Franziska, do you honestly believe that I killed a man?
Franziska:
.................. I suppose I should reserve judgement until after I have investigated this for myself. I can put your arrest on hold until then.
Edgeworth:
That's as it should be.
Franziska:
Hah! I don't need a lecture on how to perform my duties from you of all people. "To be perfect in everyway." The fulfillemnt of that creed alone is all I strive for!
Edgeworth:
Well, I have my own creed which I must fulfill, so why don't we solve this together?
Franziska:
...I have to get going. The crime scene awaits. Don't you dare leave town.
Edgeworth:
Trust me, I had no intention to.
Franziska:
Detective Gumshoe!
???:
Yes, sir!
Franziska:
Too slow!
Gumshoe:
Owww!
Franziska:
Listen up. I'm leaving you in charge of watching this man. Don't mess up, understand!?
Gumshoe:
M-Mr. Edgeworth!? I'm supposed to guard him!?
Franziska:
A simple yes or no, Detective!
Gumshoe:
Ack! Yes, sir! Understood, sir! You just leave it to me!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth. If you interfere with my investigation, I'll arrest you on the spot. Are we clear? Now then, if you'll excuse me.
Gumshoe:
Good to see you again, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Boy am I glad to see you're OK!
Edgeworth:
Thank you, Detective.
Gumshoe:
I believe in you, sir! You can lean on me! I'll get you through this!
Edgeworth:
(I have to admit I'm a bit curious as to what Franziska is up to. Maybe I should ask the good detective...) Very well. In that case, I have a few questions for you.
Gate
Edgeworth:
(I should try to get some information out of Detective Gumshoe first.)
Counter
Edgeworth:
I can't believe there's no one manning the counter when a murder has just occurred.
Window
Edgeworth:
What a view of the planes preparing for takeoff. Besides the turbulence, they're really not all that bad as a mode of transportation.
Dick Gumshoe
Initial investigation
Edgeworth:
So how is the initial investigation going?
Gumshoe:
We just shipped the body off to the coroner's office... ...and we're taking statements now, sir!
Edgeworth:
That sounds like Franziska. She was always good at quick responses to a case.
Gumshoe:
I'd say she was, uh... a little too quick, sir.
Edgeworth:
Oh? How so?
Gumshoe:
Uh... Um...! I rushed on over as soon as I got word of the affair, sir! But somehow, when I got here... ...Ms. von Karma was already here barking out orders at everyone! It was kinda creepy! As though she knew there had been a murder or something... ...and had come in advance to await your flight's arrival!
Edgeworth:
(That is sort of odd. She did show up rather quickly, and out of the blue. Plus, I still don't know why she's here in America... There must be some backstory to all of this.)
Franziska von Karma
Gumshoe:
Ms. von Karma just kinda popped up at the Prosecutor's Office about a week ago, sir. Something about chasing down leads related to a certain incident...
Edgeworth:
No details?
Gumshoe:
It's kinda top-secret, so she can't talk about it, even with me, sir.
Edgeworth:
(Knowing her, the only type of talking she likes to do is with her whip. Plus, I doubt the top secret part was what stopped her from talking to you, Detective. Although, I wonder if her case has anything to do with mine...?)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Gumshoe:
Hey, Mr. Edgeworth, I think something just fell out of your pocket.
Edgeworth:
Hm? What are you.........gnrk!
Gumshoe:
S-So did something fall out or not? I didn't, um, get a good look, sir!
Edgeworth:
...It doesn't concern you, so don't worry about it. (My Prosecutor's Badge, of all things! Gumshoe must never know that I dropped it!)
Mr. Ifly Piggy Bank
Gumshoe:
Wh-Wh-Wh-What is this... this raccoon-looking thing!?
Edgeworth:
It's not a raccoon. It's the mascot of iFly Airlines. His name is Mr. Ifly, and apparently, he's supposed to be a monkey.
Gumshoe:
Ooooooooooh! I'm feeling some inspiration coming ooooooon! I'm going to make a piggy bank out of the police mascot, the Blue Badger! Then, whenever there's any loose change lying around the precinct, it can go in there!
Edgeworth:
Sure, sounds great. (...As long as it isn't any of my money.)
iFly suitcase
Gumshoe:
So! This design! It's so post-modern, sir!
Edgeworth:
...Post-modern, you say?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, especially this alien-shaped handle here. You can really feel a connection.
Edgeworth:
...A connection. right. Detective, please stop with your horrible impression of an art critic.
Gumshoe:
But I was only telling you my honest feelings, sir...
Anything else
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe, this is...
Gumshoe:
Oh! Is that for me!? Aww, you shouldn't have, sir! But I'll gladly take anything you want to give to me!
Edgeworth:
Hands off, Detective! This item is related to the case!
Gumshoe:
O-Oh... So, um, what about it did you want to ask me about...?
Edgeworth:
...Forget I asked, Detective.
Boy
Edgeworth:
This child seems to be happily enjoying the sight of so many planes.
Boy:
Wow!!! I'd love to take a run down that runaway!
Edgeworth:
............Oh, the youth of today. So much potential, yet so misguided.
Sal Manella
Edgeworth:
Hm? Looking from behind... I think I've seen this man somewhere before...
Passenger:
OM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM! In Soviet Russia, World Flags Lunchboxes eat j00! Urrr...Nnn...F... (&gt;_&lt;;) Found it! LAWL!! Ooh! I feel a wave of CR34T1V3 POW3RZ coming ON! It's over 9000!!! LULZ! For my next L33T movie, it's gonna be "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo"... versus "The World Samurai: Champion of the Earth"! It's gonna r0x0rz so many b0x0rz!
Edgeworth:
So the Steel Samurai is finally getting a movie...
Customer and vendor
Edgeworth:
Hmm... "Lunchland"... Not bad. I guess it's gotten big enough to warrant its own branch shops.
Customer:
Hmm... Which should I go with?
Vendor:
I recommend our airport special, World Flags Lunchboxes! Only available for a limited time! We have a variety of lunchboxes made up to look like different countries' flags!
Edgeworth:
...I wonder if they're aiming to take Lunchland to the international market?
Sitting man
Edgeworth:
This man was in First Class with me. He was quite shaken up by the whole affair.
Passenger:
*quiver*... I... I did it... I made it the whole flight... I'm not scared of turbulence anymore!
Edgeworth:
He must have been pretty scared. He's repeating the same thing over and over to himself.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Gumshoe:
Anyway, that's about all the info I have, sir. We should find out more as we investigate.
Edgeworth:
(Yes, it is high time to resume my investigation. Starting with talking to the people involved in this case afresh.)
Counter
Edgeworth:
I can't believe there's no one manning the counter when a murder has just occurred.
Gumshoe:
Relax, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm here! I'll make sure nothing else happens!
Edgeworth:
(You are precisely why I can't relax.)
Window
Edgeworth:
What a view of the planes preparing for takeoff.
Gumshoe:
I wanna ride a plane someday and go overseas!
Edgeworth:
...Have you never been to another country before, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Nope, not yet, sir! I don't even have a passport! But I've been saving up for that eventual "someday"! A penny a day to be precise!
Edgeworth:
(At that rate, he won't be making any trips until well after retirement!)
Boy
Edgeworth:
This child seems to be happily enjoying the sight of so many planes.
Gumshoe:
I'm all excited to see this many planes, too! Just look at the size of these things!
Boy:
Do you like planes, too, mister? The balance between the main wings and the tail wings is really something, huh!?
Edgeworth:
Hah... It seems that this child derives his pleasure from a different aspect.
Gumshoe:
Oh, but I've also got a thing for the shape of the wings, too!
Boy:
Here, mister! You can stand next to me! So about that plane's wing...
Edgeworth:
(Tsk! Thank you, Detective, for leaving me out of this conversation!)
Sal Manella
Edgeworth:

Gumshoe:
Phew! Good thing it was a false alarm, right, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
So the Steel Samurai is finally getting a movie...
Gumshoe:
......Completely ignoring me, as usual. *whimper*
Customer and vendor
Edgeworth:
Hmm... "Lunchland"... Not bad. I guess it's gotten big enough to warrant its own branch shops.
Gumshoe:
Ooh! I've always wanted to give their Steak Lunch a try!
Customer:
Hmm... Which should I go with?
Vendor:
I recommend our airport special, World Flags Lunchboxes! Only available for a limited time! We have a variety of lunchboxes made up to look like different countries' flags!
Edgeworth:
If you really want one that badly, Detective, why don't you go ahead and buy one?
Gumshoe:
I-Is that OK, sir!? Thanks! Alright, then I'm really gonna get one! Here I go! Excuse me, miss! I'll take a Star-Spangled Banner Lunchbox, please!
Edgeworth:
(...I hope he's aware that's the most expensive one on the menu.)
Sitting man
Edgeworth:
This man was in First Class with me. He was quite shaken up by the whole affair.
Gumshoe:
I'd be pretty scared too if I got caught up in a murder investigation, sir.
Passenger:
*quiver*... I... I did it... I made it the whole flight... I'm not scared of turbulence anymore! *quiver*... This life vest is proof I made it alive. It's now my prized possession.
Edgeworth:
...How could you just take that from the plane!?
Gumshoe:
It's OK, Mr. Edgeworth. It's got nothing to do with the murder, at least.
Examine evidence
Bloody cloth in iFly suitcase
Gumshoe:
So get this, sir! I bet the victim used this suitcase as his hiding place!
Edgeworth:
...Ex-Excuse me?
Gumshoe:
You know! To stow away onto this flight, sir! He must've been inside all along! But someone found him out and that's when *bam* he was killed! Actually, that was the plot of a movie I saw recently...!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Get your head out of the theater and back into reality.
Blood in corner inside iFly Suitcase
Gumshoe:
That's the victim's blood... Right, sir?
Edgeworth:
I suspect so, but we won't know much more until it's been processed by forensics.
Gumshoe:
Well, it's a good thing no one wanted to buy this suitcase!
Edgeworth:
...How so?
Gumshoe:
Imagine the shock on their face when they go to open it and out pops a dead body!
Edgeworth:
...I suppose. (Although it's really nothing to get all shocked over.)
March 12, 1:37 PMFlight I-390, Second FloorFirst Class
Franziska:
So you must be the captain.
Captain:
Why, yes, I am! And who might you be?
Franziska:
I am the Prodigy Prosecutor, Franziska von Karma, and I have a few questions for you.
Meele:
Ahhh, don't you dare, Captain! Getting friendly with another woman... I'll never forgive if you do!
Captain:
Wh-What are you talking about? I-I only have eyes for you, my dear Cammy!
Edgeworth:
(I wouldn't bet money on our dear captain to be much of a reputable person.)
Gumshoe:
Sure you don't want to ask the captain some questions, sir?
Edgeworth:
He was in the cockpit the entire time. I highly doubt he would know anything of use. Anyway, I like to leave that type of witness to Franziska and her whip.
Captain:
Aaaaaaaaah!!!
March 12, 1:40 PMFlight I-390, First FloorLounge
???:
Now see here!!!
Gumshoe:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack! Sorry, sorry, sorry! I'm SOOOOOOOOOORRY!!
Lablanc:
How long do you intend to hold me!? It is impossible for me to be the criminal! I told you!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Lablanc...
Lablanc:
Oh, it is you! Tell this man to stop stopping me from going! Time is money! I don't have even one second of wasteful time to spend!
Partner
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir?
Notice anything?
Edgeworth:
Anything of interest, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Um, well, I can say that I don't quite know everything about the situation yet... ...so I was just telling myself that I should go ask someone about the stuff I don't know! I mean, just because I don't know it doesn't mean someone else might not know it, right!?
Edgeworth:
(It must be my imagination, but for a second, I think I actually understood his logic!)
Blue door or police officer
Officer:
Sir, you can't go in there.
Edgeworth:
I'm Miles Edgeworth. I am one of the prosecutors on this case, so please let me through.
Officer:
I'm very sorry, sir. No one is allowed to enter without Ms. von Karma's express permission.
Edgeworth:
But I'm on the case...
Officer:
Yes, I understand that, but... ...I also have explicit instructions not to let you through from Ms. von Karma.
Edgeworth:
(Grrr... Why would you do this to me, Franziska...?)
Piano
Gumshoe:
They've got a piano on this plane!? Hey! Do you think I can try it out, sir?
Edgeworth:
I'd think you would know better than to randomly touch things at a crime scene, Detective! Besides, I didn't know you knew how to play.
Gumshoe:
Of course I do! I'm practically proficient!
Edgeworth:
(Interesting... The things you learn about people on a daily basis.)
Gumshoe:
I can get Do and Re to come out just right, sir!
Edgeworth:
Two notes does not a proficient pianist make, Detective.
Windows
Gumshoe:
Oh, man... there's a really pretty lady in that plane over there. Aaaaaaack! She's looking over here! Quick, sir! Wave at her with me, please!
Edgeworth:
I refuse to be your wingman on this!
Magazines
Edgeworth:
(There are a few copies of Sky Magazine in the magazine rack.)
Gumshoe:
This month's special... Oh, looks like it's an English trivia quiz. Oh, I've got one! What starts with "i" and means "boldly rude" and "disrespectful"?
Edgeworth:
(The answer is most definitely "insolent".)
Gumshoe:
Time's up! Sorry, sir, but the correct answer is "insolvent"!
Edgeworth:
(Detective Gumshoe... Don't tell me your English ability is at the same level as "him"...)
Statue on left
Gumshoe:
Hey! This statue...
Edgeworth:
What about it, Detective? Did you notice something?
Gumshoe:
I saw this guy in a dream last night! The resemblance is uncanny, sir!
Edgeworth:
You saw him in your dreams?
Gumshoe:
Well, yeah. I saw him, and then I arrested him! I wanted to show you just how vital I am in our partnership!
Edgeworth:
(Being useful in your sleep is of no help to me in the real world, Detective.)
Toppled-over chair
Gumshoe:
Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! You have to see this chair!! It says, "In honor of Rocker Pals' Day".
Edgeworth:
And what exactly is the big deal with these "Rocker Pals"?
Gumshoe:
They're a seriously sweet Swiss super-star rock band, sir! Ah... Makes me wanna listen to one of their songs right now.
Edgeworth:
Sorry, I got lost in that forest of s's just now...
Gumshoe:
Do you want me to explain it to you again?
Edgeworth:
You know, Detective, I think I'll have to take a raincheck on that, regrettably.
Police line
Gumshoe:
Looks like we can't go beyond here, sir.
Edgeworth:
(Plus, the body has been sent off to the medical examiner's office for an autopsy.)
First Class
Dishes
Gumshoe:
M-Mr. Edgeworth! What is this super-expensive-looking feast of Jurassic proportions?
Edgeworth:
It's just the food they serve in First Class.
Gumshoe:
Wow! I am so jealous, sir! I wanna ride in First Class sometime!
Edgeworth:
(Right... When pigs fly and I own my own private jet...)
Elevator button
Edgeworth:
(There's nothing supernatural about earthquakes and elevators! Although... Is it just me or do elevators have a long-standing hatred for me?)
Vase on seat
Gumshoe:
Hey, Mr. Edgeworth, this urn's got a seatbelt strapped tightly around it!
Edgeworth:
It must be of great value to Mr. Lablanc then.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I guess if you don't want to churn your urn, then it's always best to buckle up!
Edgeworth:
Obviously. But did that have anything to do with the case, Detective?
Gumshoe:
...Nobody gets my jokes.
Cammy Meele
Edgeworth:
If I may have a word with you, Ms. Meele...
Meele:
No, you may not have a word with me. I don't want to talk to any other man except for the captain right now.
Captain:
Me, too, Cammy! I... I will never talk to another woma.... aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!
Edgeworth:
(This definitely looks like a job for Franziska.)
Movie poster
Gumshoe:
Ooh, a movie poster! So what's it for, sir?
Edgeworth:
"License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder", apparently, though I don't know what it's about.
Captain:
Oh, that movie is the in-flight special! I can't recommend it enough!
Meele:
Aaah! When you talk like that, you sound just like Ms. Rhoda! And you know how I hate that.
Captain:
I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean for it to come out like that, Cammy!
Edgeworth:
(Clearly, the only remedy for this whipped man is a solid crack of Franziska's whip.)
Franziska:
You impudent man! If you value your life, you will close that mouth of yours immediately!
Gumshoe:
Wow, Ms. von Karma's more hard-boiled than the movie.
Captain
Captain:
What did I ever do to deserve this...&#160;? More than this job, all I truly love is my sweet Cammy!
Edgeworth:
(Might I suggest you not say that at this moment in front of Franziska...?)
Franziska von Karma
Edgeworth:
Franziska, I'd like to ask you about the investigation...
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth. Can't you see that I'm in the middle of taking his statement? This man is the only captain in title. I'm going to teach him to do his job properly.
Captain:
Owww!! OK, OK! From now on, I'll keep my focus and take my responsibilities seriously!
Gumshoe:
He's really trembling there...
Edgeworth:
If it makes him to take his job seriously, it's not such a bad thing, is it?
Gumshoe:
Wh-Why are you looking at me like that, sir!?
Black bag on seat
Edgeworth:
This was the victim's seat.
Gumshoe:
His jacket's just lying there, and his spilled left-over coffee's still there, too.
Edgeworth:
(I don't suppose anyone ever expects to die.)
Edgeworth's seat
Edgeworth:
This was my seat.
Gumshoe:
Wow! You read law books even when you're flying, sir!?
Edgeworth:
Were you expecting anything less? Now come along, we must hurry to the crime scene!
Gumshoe:
Hm? Hold on a sec... There's a different book stuck in here. "The Steel Samurai's Adv..."
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe! Am I going to have to charge you with invasion of privacy!?
Seat with life jacket
Edgeworth:
The man in this seat was the one we just saw out in the airport lobby hyperventilating. If he's so scared to fly, then why take an airplane to begin with?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, if he's that scared, he shoulda caught a ferry or a cruise ship or something. By the way, were you OK with all the turbulence, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
.................. Ah, yes. It was nothing I couldn't handle.
Gumshoe:
I should've figured, right? As if you'd get on a plane if you were scared of them!
Edgeworth:
I-Indeed.
Chessboard
Gumshoe:
Hey, Mr. Edgeworth? I think you have too many red knights on this board...
Edgeworth:
It's just your imagination.
Gumshoe:
And it looks like that blue pawn is being completely surrounded by the red knights.
Edgeworth:
Now you're seeing things.
Gumshoe:
Um, sir... I don't think you're supposed to have lots of the same piece like in checkers...
Edgeworth:
I know that, Detective! What do you take me for!?
Lifesaver
Gumshoe:
That's a really big floaty! But isn't it a bit too early in this year for swimming?
Edgeworth:
Detective, that is not for swimming. It's a lifesaver.
Gumshoe:
So you can't swim with one of these?
Edgeworth:
No... I mean, I suppose you could, but that's not what they are intended for...
Gumshoe:
Well then, see, it's the same as a floaty! You shouldn't go around confusing people, sir!
Edgeworth:
(......Why do I feel like I've just kicked a puppy?)
Seat with grape juice bottles
Edgeworth:
The man in this seat was constantly drinking something.
Gumshoe:
You know, right before payday, I do nothing but drink the soup from my instant noodles!
Edgeworth:
...That much sodium can't be healthy. You might want to go in for a check-up.
Gumshoe:
Ho ho, did you really think I was serious, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
......!
Gumshoe:
Waaaaaaah! I'm sorry, sir!!! I'll never make another joke like that again!
Seat with steak
Gumshoe:
Wh-What's this!?!?
Edgeworth:
What is it, Detective!? Did you find an important piece of evidence?
Gumshoe:
A giant parfait on top of bread AND steak!? Paint me jealous, sir! It's a feast!
Edgeworth:
............ (Maybe I should just let him have the giant parfait so that we can move on...)
Grape juice bottles
Edgeworth:
A mountain's worth of empty bottles are lined up here.
Gumshoe:
And look! All of them have a letter inside, sir. Let's see... "I'll order anything as many times as it takes, just to see your lovely face. My beloved Ms. Teneiro..." is what they all say, sir!
Edgeworth:
...Please put them back in the bottles, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Yeah... I can't destroy the beautiful love here by ruining the letters by accident!
Lounge
Zinc Lablanc II
Edgeworth:
Did you finish taking his statement yet?
Gumshoe:
Yup, all done, sir.
Lablanc:
I do not concern if you're not done examining the cargo hold. I want my cargo back!
Lablanc's cargo
Lablanc:
If you make a single scratch on my art, you will pay!
Edgeworth:
Art? What sort of art?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Lablanc is an art dealer, so he's got a bunch of artwork down in the cargo hold, sir. There's practically a mountain of them, large and small.
Lablanc:
From folk costumes to stone statues, I sell all kinds of arts!
Edgeworth:
(Folk costumes...? Speaking of which, Mr. Lablanc's hat... It kinds of looks like that other piece of cloth...)
Rhoda Teneiro (appears after presenting Bloody Cloth)
Leads to:
"What did you mean by "that attendant", Mr. Lablanc?"
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Lablanc:
You! I can say you have the guts to show me a piece of art at this time. But from a single glance I can already tell it is mostly worthless.
Edgeworth:
(Hah. This has much more value as a piece of non-art, I assure you.)
Lablanc:
You look like you have something to say! Perhaps you are thinking, "like casting pearls before swine"?
Edgeworth:
(He actually hit the nail on the head for once!)
Mr. Hicks's Travel Wallet
Lablanc:
Ah, so you are finally paying my wasted money?
Edgeworth:
Sorry, but there is absolutely nothing inside this wallet.
Lablanc:
How dare you! You are wanting to trick me! I will sue for fraud!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Lablanc. Are you seriously considering a courtroom tango with me? I hope not, but in case you are, there is a certain lawyer I can introduce you to.
Bloody Cloth
Edgeworth:
Mr. Lablanc, can you please take a look at this for me?
Lablanc:
Hm? Oh! It's a Borginian cloth!
Edgeworth:
As I suspected. Your hat is made of the same material, I suppose?
Lablanc:
Yes, of course! This fabric is so famous, orders come from over the seas for more!
Bloody Cloth data updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Then this is the cargo you were talking about earlier?
Lablanc:
No, no, no. My cargo this time is much, much many gigantic! You, Detective! When can I have my cargo moved!?
Gumshoe:
You can get your cargo back when we're done investigating, pal!
Lablanc:
The stubbornness of you police, it is no good! And it is no good that attendant refuses to exit the attendants' room, too!
Edgeworth:
That attendant...? (I wonder if he's talking about Ms. Teneiro?)
Anything else
Lablanc:
What is it!? Do you have some use for me? You seem not to understand; I have no time to waste! Let me put it another way! "Le temps, c'est de l'argent!" There! Maybe another language will get through your head!
Edgeworth:
(I understood you perfectly fine in English.)
Examine evidence
Blood on Bloody Cloth
Edgeworth:
For there to be this much blood on this piece of cloth... Was the victim wrapped in it at some point? According to Mr. Lablanc, this textile is fairly famous.
Gumshoe:
What a waste...
Edgeworth:
What did you mean by "that attendant", Mr. Lablanc?
Lablanc:
She was taken into the attendants' room for her interview. And then they still have not come out! They make no sign of coming out either! I was finished with my own interview much earlier, quicker than her!
Edgeworth:
(Why is Ms. Teneiro's interview the only one that's taking up so much time...?)
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth. You were given free reign to examine the plane, weren't you?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I was able to obtain the cooperation of the flight attendants. Speaking of attendants, I'd like to speak with Ms. Teneiro. I wonder if you might grant me permission to enter the flight attendants' room?
Franziska:
Hmph. Before I do... ...you still have to clear up a few issues surrounding your own circumstances.
Edgeworth:
...I understand.
Franziska:
You may have tricked those attendants with your sophisticated talking... ...but you can't pull the wool over my eyes, Miles Edgeworth.
-- Franziska's Logic --
Franziska:
Let's not complicate things and go with the most obvious conclusion.
The scene of the crime was here, in the very lounge the body was discovered.
From the time the victim was seen calling for an attendant until his body as found...
...the only person in this lounge the entire time was you, Miles Edgeworth!
This, unmistakably, makes you the likeliest suspect.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. The "likeliest suspect", Franziska?
Franziska:
Do you have a problem with that?
Edgeworth:
No, but it's not like you to use such vague wording. You're usually a bit more... absolute.
Franziska:
I'm simply trying to watch out you. Or my kindness too hard for you to comprehend?
Edgeworth:
Thank you, but your leniency is unnecessary, for I will prove my innocence soon enough! (If I want to continue my investigation, I'll have to break her line of logic, fast!)
Rebuttal

Franziska:
Let's not complicate things and go with the most obvious conclusion.

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Don't you think you're being a bit rash by simply declaring me the culprit?
Franziska:
Hmph. I like my affairs to be simple. And perfect. I'll show you the meaning of both when I finish this whole thing within three minutes!
Gumshoe:
Hey! You say that like you're cooking a pack of instant noodles! Threeeeeooooowww!
Franziska:
I won't allow even three seconds of useless testimony to be uttered in my presence!
Edgeworth:
(...I see she hasn't changed a bit. But I won't allow her to send me to prison so easily.)
Franziska:
The scene of the crime was here, in the very lounge the body was discovered.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So tell me, Franziska, do you know all there is to know about the crime scene?
Franziska:
I know all that I need to know in order to arrest you.
Edgeworth:
And nothing more?
Franziska:
.........Are you saying there is more I need to know!?
Gumshoe:
Aaaaaaaaah! Wh-Why did you whip me, sir!?
Franziska:
Sorry, Scruffy. My hand must've slipped.
Edgeworth:
(It would appear that Franziska doesn't have all the facts of this case yet.)
Present iFly Suitcase
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"It would appear that you did not have all the information you need after all."
Franziska:
From the time the victim was seen calling for an attendant until his body as found...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
What do you mean by "seen"?
Franziska:
Please stop pretending like you don't know. It's insulting. Obviously, I'm talking about how Mr. Hicks was seen calling for an attendant at 5 AM. And then, from the time after that call until the body was found...
Franziska:
...the only person in this lounge the entire time was you, Miles Edgeworth!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
While it's true that I was in the lounge the whole time... ...that fact alone does not make me the criminal.
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Hah, we'll see about that at the conclusion of this investigation. However, there is one thing that even you must admit at this time.
Franziska:
This, unmistakably, makes you the likeliest suspect.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Under the circumstances, I suppose I can agree that I am the most likely suspect.
Gumshoe:
B-but I believe in you, sir! I don't think you did it! Ms. von Karma's gotta believe that, too, right! I mean, you two are like siblings...OWWWW!
Franziska:
Quiet, Scruffy! Even if we are related by blood, that's no guarantee that he's not a criminal!
Edgeworth:
.........Franziska...
Franziska:
I demand to see some proof that you are not the guilty party!
Edgeworth:
(The likeliest suspect, huh. What a roundabout euphemism. But it would appear that she doesn't yet know... ...about the new evidence that we acquired, and where we acquired it. I'll take care of the gaps in her logic one hole at a time.)
Edgeworth:
It would appear that you did not have all the information you need after all.
Franziska:
And what does that mean?
Edgeworth:
I found a nice piece of evidence just before I was forced to stop investigating. A piece that proves the body was moved from a different location!
Franziska:
.........
Edgeworth:
The killer used this suitcase to move the victim's body. Meaning that the real scene of the crime is not this lounge at all!
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Now who's the one rashly jumping to conclusions?
Edgeworth:
Excuse me?
Franziska:
All you did was find this piece of cloth inside the suitcase. That doesn't prove that the body was moved. It could be that the killer simply chose that suitcase as a good place to hide the cloth.
Edgeworth:
I expected you would come to that conclusion. It would seem I can't escape that easily.
Franziska:
You should know better than that. A Von Karma is perfect in every way.
Edgeworth:
Ah, but did you know that the killer definitely wheeled the suitcase around at some point?
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
As if there is proof of that!
Edgeworth:
(Where is the proof that this suitcase was moved around?)
Present Grape Juice Footprints
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The spilled grape juice in front of the elevator..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
All it takes is one look at this and you'll have your answer!
Franziska:
Indeed, I have my answer now. ......That you are an ignorant whippersnapper!
Edgeworth:
Aaaaaaaargh! (Or rather, that you are the unforgiving whipper-snapper. The suitcase ended up in the in-flight shop, but where did it come from? The answer should become clear if I just think about the path the killer took.)
Leads back to:
"(Where is the proof that this suitcase was moved around?)"
Franziska:
The spilled grape juice in front of the elevator...
Edgeworth:
Yes, and I'd like to draw your attention to this area here... (Where is the evidence that proves the killer dragged the suitcase through here?)
Present lines
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The spilled grape juice in front of the elevator..."
Present footprints
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
We can assume these prints belong to the culprit, and they clearly lead to the shop...
Franziska:
I asked for proof about the suitcase. Give me any unrelated evidence, and you will feel the pain of my whip.
Edgeworth:
(There's no need to remind me; my body learned that lesson well a long time ago! These prints are important, but there is something else that is even more so!)
Leads back to:
"(Where is the evidence that proves the killer dragged the suitcase through here?)"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Take a look at this!
Franziska:
And what exactly am I looking at here?
Edgeworth:
I don't like to repeat myself... ...but I suppose it can't be helped if you didn't spot it on your own. Now then, I'll...
Franziska:
Get on with it and tell me the answer already.
Edgeworth:
(...I wonder if she saw through my blunder?)
Leads back to:
"(Where is the evidence that proves the killer dragged the suitcase through here?)"
Edgeworth:
This mark here... Wouldn't you say that it looks suspiciously like tracks from two wheels?
Franziska:
I suppose.
Edgeworth:
Further, there is also grape juice residue on the wheels of the suitcase. This means that the suitcase containing the victim's body definitely passed through here.
Franziska:
.........I suppose this means that the killer... ...did move the victim's body from somewhere else.
Edgeworth:
I'm glad you've come to your senses.
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Not so fast! This still doesn't put you in the clear! Not by a long shot!
-- Franziska's Logic, Pt. 2 --
Franziska:
You prepared yourself and acquired the piggy bank before the plane hit that turbulence.
And then, you waited for the victim in the lounge, where you beat him to death.
Then, while you were in the elevator with the victim's body stuck in the suitcase...
...the plane hit the patch of turbulence, and out flew the body from within the suitcase!
With no way out, you hastily put the suitcase back where you had taken it from...
...and pretended to be the "discoverer" of the body.
Edgeworth:
Not a bad bit of logic, for something you thought of on the fly.
Franziska:
Just what are you insinuating?
Edgeworth:
That I will show you exactly how flawed your logic is. (No matter how strong of a face you put on, not even you can hide your fears from me. I'll expose all the flaws in her logic in one fell swoop!)

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
And how do you suppose I was able to take the piggy bank out of its display case? As I recall, the case was locked.
Franziska:
That's easy. If the case was locked... ...you simply had to hit the glass... like this!
Gumshoe:
Eeeeeoww! Y-You've shattered my heart of glass!
Edgeworth:
(So she wants to talk about the in-flight shop and the Mr. Ifly bank, does she...?)
Franziska:
That takes care of how you obtained the murder weapon.

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I thought there wasn't any of the victim's blood found in the lounge.
Franziska:
Hmph. I thought you'd say that. What? Did you think I wouldn't have noticed? I think you just found a way to cleverly hide the blood splatter in the lounge! By "accidentally spilling" grape juice on top of it!
Edgeworth:
Gnrgh! Are you accusing me of tampering with the crime scene now!?
Franziska:
We'll see, won't we? The forensic scientists are hard at work on that as we speak.
Edgeworth:
.........And? What do you propose I did after that?
Franziska:
Then, while you were in the elevator with the victim's body stuck in the suitcase...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So I put the victim's body into the suitcase, and then? Where was I headed, Franziska?
Franziska:
That's pretty obvious. You were bringing it to First Class where you could safely keep an eye on it!
Edgeworth:
We're talking about this thing, you know. I'd hardly call it discreet or ordinary.
Franziska:
Hmph. Annoying brat. Well then, you were intending to leave it inside the elevator. But unfortunately for you, a wrench was thrown into your plans, because...
Franziska:
...the plane hit the patch of turbulence, and out flew the body from within the suitcase!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You've experienced turbulence on a flight before.
Franziska:
Of course. Many times. You get used to it after a while.
Edgeworth:
The patch we hit was especially rough... and I passed out briefly, but only for a second.
Gumshoe:
Good thing it was only for a sec, sir! It'd been bad if you had really blanked out!
Edgeworth:
Y...Yes, indeed. (Unfortunately, blanking out is exactly what got me into this mess in the first place.)
Franziska:
That's enough of your idle chatter. I'm not through with you yet, Miles Edgeworth!

With no way out, you hastily put the suitcase back where you had taken it from...

Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... If I really were a criminal, do you really think I would be so easily caught?
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
You are certainly in the middle of being caught right now!
Edgeworth:
Gnaaaaaaargh! (I have to find a contradiction fast, or I won't have much of my own hide left to save!)
Franziska:
I have to say, you are looking rather caught right now. And I'll tell you exactly what you did after that. You loitered around in the lounge...
Franziska:
...and pretended to be the "discoverer" of the body.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I didn't pretend to be anything! I really was the first to discover the victim's body!
Franziska:
...I suppose that's true.
Edgeworth:
Hm...? So then...you are yielding to my statements?
Franziska:
Don't be foolish! I still insist that you are the killer, but... ...in that sense, you really were the first to "discover the body to be dead."
Edgeworth:
(...No matter what I say, she seems dead set on making me out to be the killer.)
Edgeworth:
(Her logic is reasonably sound... ...and the large majority of it reflects the truth... ...but there is one point about it that is not quite right.)
Edgeworth:
The fact that you took this piece of evidence into account in your testimony... ...is to be commended. Your legal prowess is certainly something to be feared.
Franziska:
Evidence and logic. Essential tools that those who would stand in a courtroom must learn to master.
Edgeworth:
But what if there was a fake piece of evidence thrown into the mix?
Franziska:
A fake...?
Edgeworth:
This Mr. Ifly piggy bank is just such a fake! It is NOT the real murder weapon!
Franziska:
WHAT!?
Edgeworth:
The timing of when the bank was taken from the shop is important. And it was taken after the turbulence had occurred.
Franziska:
But then, what about the blood on the bank!? What do you make of that!?
Edgeworth:
I assume it was added after the murder when the killer fabricated this weapon. Looking at it this way, the killer did basically three things after the turbulence. After exiting the elevator... ...the killer brought the suitcase to the shop and left it there. Then, the killer proceeded to pick the bank up from off the floor... ...and took it to fabricate a fake murder weapon by hitting the victim on the head. Finally, the victim's wallet was planted on my personage, in my pocket to be precise. Everything was done so that I would be framed for the murder of Mr. Akbey Hicks!
Franziska:
You there!
Officer:
Yes, ma'am!
Franziska:
Other than this piggy bank, was anything else resembling a murder weapon found?
Officer:
We didn't find anything in the lounge or in the shop that could be used as one, ma'am! Most of the items that could have been used were broken during the turbulence. And the remaining items all tested negative for any trace of blood!
Franziska:
........I see. Well, Miles Edgeworth, it appears your stall tactics are at an end.
Gumshoe:
But it's possible that it's just hidden somewhere, sir! Eeeeeeeek!
Franziska:
If the criminal had wanted to hide the weapon in a safer place... ...I'd think the weapon would have been hidden in the same place as the bloody cloth.
Edgeworth:
Exactly what I was thinking. Because the cloth was hidden inside that suitcase, it signals to me that the killer... ...had not prepared a more secure place to hide the evidence. Which means that the real murder weapon is either still on the murderer's personage... ...or is still at the real crime scene.
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
There is one more possibility.
Edgeworth:
And that would be?
Franziska:
That the piggy bank is in fact the real weapon.
Edgeworth:
But didn't we just...
Hold it!
Franziska:
Let me finish! The killer took the bank out from the display case before the turbulence... ...by opening the lock on the display case door. And it was at that time that the glass pane in the door was broken. I'd say that's a perfectly reasonable line of reasoning, wouldn't you? Let's see... so that means that the killer had the key to the display case...
Edgeworth:
Franziska... The person you're talking about...
Franziska:
Not so fast, I'm not finished! The person I'm talking about also committed another sin. She tricked the captain... ...and granted you permission to conduct the investigation. Yes, it is the sin of lying!
Edgeworth:
...!
Franziska:
Speaking of which, I recall that you also wished to speak with her.
Edgeworth:
Yes.
Franziska:
Very well, permission granted. But only if I can sit in on your interrogation. Do we understand each other?
Edgeworth:
I have no intention of interrogating her. But you are welcome to accompany me if you so wish.
Franziska:
Ms. Teneiro is in the flight attendants' room. Let's move.
Partner
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir?
Franziska's Logic
Gumshoe:
Way to show her who's boss, Mr. Edgeworth! Not even Ms. von Karma's whip is a match for you!
Edgeworth:
You give me too much credit. She simply didn't have all the information. To be sure, the fights will become tougher and tougher as this investigation progresses.
Gumshoe:
That's alright, Mr. Edgeworth! You've got me watching your back! I'll make sure to keep on supporting you any way I can! You just say the word, sir!
Edgeworth:
(Really...? Then how about standing out in front and absorbing whip lashes for me?)
Officer
Officer:
I've been told by Ms. von Karma that you can now enter the flight attendants' room. Please feel free to look around!
Edgeworth:
Thank you. (Now to unravel Ms. Teneiro's true intentions!)
Zinc Lablanc II
Lablanc:
You! Hurry and solve your murder! If you do not, how am I supposed to have my cargo returned to me!?
Edgeworth:
If you could please be patient just a little longer, Mr. Lablanc...
Lablanc:
Hurry and solve it! Like a strike of thunder!
Edgeworth:
(It's "As fast as lightning." And believe me, if I could, I would.)
Franziska von Karma
Franziska:
Ms. Teneiro is in the flight attendants' room. Let's move.
Gumshoe:
That blue door over there leads to the flight attendants' room, sir!
Edgeworth:
Alright. Let's go see what Ms. Teneiro has to say for herself.
First Class
Movie poster
Gumshoe:
Ooh, a movie poster! So what's it for, sir?
Edgeworth:
"License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder", apparently, though I don't know what it's about.
Captain:
Oh, that movie is the in-flight special! I can't recommend it enough!
Meele:
Aaah! When you talk like that, you sound just like Ms. Rhoda! And you know how I hate that.
Captain:
I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean for it to come out like that, Cammy!
Edgeworth:
(This man really needs a solid crack of Franziska's whip.)
Cammy Meele
Edgeworth:
If I many have a word with you, Ms. Meele...
Meele:
No, you may not have a word with me.
Edgeworth:
I want to assure you that the lady is a fellow prosecutor. Her name is Franziska von Karma.
Meele:
I don't care who she is, she's talking with mon capitaine!
Edgeworth:
(I sense Ms. Meele is the type who considers every other woman to be a threat...)
Captain
Edgeworth:
I'm so sorry for the late introduction. I am Miles Edgeworth, prosecutor. I believe one of the attendants asked you in my stead for permission to investigate.
Captain:
Ah, yes... You must be the prosecutor Camm... I mean, Ms. Meele was telling me about. I remember telling her you could investigate the in-flight shop, or something of the sort.
Edgeworth:
(Then I guess it's true; Ms. Teneiro didn't ask him for permission on my behalf.)
Captain:
Oh, sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm the captain of...
Edgeworth:
Thank you for your help. (I think this is about all the information I'm going to get from this man.)
March 12, 2:23 PMFlight I-390, First FloorFlight Attendants' Room
Franziska:
So you're the one that poked around inside this plane without the captain's permission!
Teneiro:
.........
Franziska:
Deviating from the flight attendant's manual is very unbecoming, you know. What were you hoping to accomplish by doing that?
Teneiro:
...I... I...
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro...
Teneiro:
Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! You're here, too!?
Edgeworth:
Can you please help us and shed some light on why you did what you did?
Teneiro:
......Alright.
Partner
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir?
Notice anything?
Edgeworth:
What are you doing, and why are you fidgeting?
Gumshoe:
I... I've never been on a plane before. And I've never been in an attendants' room...
Edgeworth:
Well, even on a normal flight, one would rarely ever need to enter one.
Gumshoe:
I don't know when I'll ever get to be on a plane again, so I wanna soak it all in now, sir! Let's see... A box full of crowns, and a yellow suitcase, and, oh... what a great trip!
Edgeworth:
Pagind Detective Gumshoe. Kindly return to the situation at hand.
Blue door
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! Isn't there something that should be doing right now?
Edgeworth:
Of course. I should be asking Ms. Teneiro for her side of the story.
Franziska:
That's right. And how does that have anything to do with what's over there?
Edgeworth:
Nothing really.
Franziska:
If you already knew that, then why don't you hurry up with the interrogation already?
Officer
Officer:
This door leads to the cargo hold. But I can't let you through without Ms. von Karma's express permission.
Edgeworth:
That's not a bad way to handle this situation if it was any old case, but this isn't.
Gumshoe:
So between you and Ms. von Karma, who's better at their job?
Edgeworth:
Oh, there is no comparison to be made, Detective. None.
Box filled with stuffs
Edgeworth:
What is all this junk inside these boxes? There's no rhyme or reason to any of it.
Teneiro:
That's our lost and found, Ms. Edgeworth.
Gumshoe:
Gold crowns, and swords, and necklaces... It's like a treasure trove in here, sir!
Edgeworth:
(The fact that these were left on the plane implies they were carried onto it to begin with... Something tells me it's time for iFly to send its metal detectors out for repairs.)
Trash Can
Edgeworth:
There is sure to be a clue of some sort in this trash can. Detective Gumshoe, if you please.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! You just leave the rummaging to me!
Franziska:
Scruffy! How dare you go through a woman's trash without her permission!? Have you no sense of honor!?
Gumshoe:
Eeeeeeek! I'm sorry! I-I'm just doing what Mr. Edgeworth told me to doooooooowww!
Edgeworth:
(Forgive me, Detective...)
Beds
Edgeworth:
(It's pretty easy to tell who sleeps in which bunk just by looking. I am almost certain that the well-kept one up top belongs to Ms. Teneiro.)
Gumshoe:
Ewww... This bottom one is a giant mess.
Franziska:
......You sloven, squalid, scoundrel of a man... You dare to scrutinize a woman's bed and invade her privacy!?
Gumshoe:
Yeeeeeeeoooww!
Edgeworth:
(*sigh* There are some things in life best kept to yourself, Detective.)
Franziska von Karma
Franziska:
Well, go on. Let's hear out troublesome attendant out.
Edgeworth:
In due time. I do have one thing I'd like to ask you.
Franziska:
...Yes?
Edgeworth:
Do you plan to continue using that whip for the foreseeable future?
Franziska:
Of course! I've wrangled many a testimony out of people thanks to it.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and probably a whole ton of yelps, toooooooooowwww!!
Edgeworth:
And I'm willing to bet that the majority of them came from you, Detective.
Unopened box
Edgeworth:
And what are inside these boxes?
Teneiro:
Oh, those are some souvenirs I bought in Borginia.
Gumshoe:
There's so many! There's even a second box!
Teneiro:
Well, yes. I find that folk art from around the world does great things for my creativity.
Edgeworth:
(Those suitcases certainly could have done with a whole lot less of your "creativity"...)
Panel
Edgeworth:
What exactly is this panel for?
Teneiro:
Ah, that's the emergency control panel for the elevator. We used it to stop the elevator on the first floor and to keep its doors open.
Rhoda Teneiro
Captain's Permission
Edgeworth:
Why did you lie about receiving the captain's permission like that?
Teneiro:
.................. Because I didn't think I would be able to get his permission.
Edgeworth:
What do you mean?
Teneiro:
The captain... He only has ears for Cammy...
Franziska:
I spoke with the captain a little earlier myself. He definitely seems to be rather taken with Ms. Meele.
Teneiro:
Yes... and on top of that... ...I had mistakenly accused Mr. Edgeworth of being the killer. I wanted to make amends.
Edgeworth:
In that case, please allow me to thank you for what you did. Thanks to you, I was able to clear myself of all charges.
Teneiro:
Really!? You were able to prove your innocence? Oh, thank goodness!
Franziska:
Ms. Teneiro, is it? There is one more thing I'd like to ask you. You were in the in-flight shop just before the turbulence, weren't you? Please answer honestly.
Teneiro:
Yes, I was.
Franziska:
And why were you there?
Teneiro:
Well, I...
Edgeworth:
(Hm? Why the sudden hesitation? Franziska seems to have struck a nerve...)
In-flight shop
Teneiro:
All I did was go check up on the shop like I always do.
Franziska:
You're saying it was for work then?
Teneiro:
Yes. I'm in charge of the shop, so I have to keep an eye on it. I don't have any reason to go there otherwise.
Franziska:
After your visit to the shop, you paid a visit to this room, correct?
Teneiro:
Yes. I came back to freshen up and adjust my make-up. I'm sorry, but there isn't much else to tell...
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... Ms. Teneiro claims to have no reason other than duty to go to the shop. But is that all there is to it? Maybe I should ask her about that thing.)
The last suitcase (appears after presenting iFly Suitcase after talking about "In-flight shop")
Leads to:
"So you're saying, Ms. Teneiro, that the suitcase in question was the last one?"
Present
iFly Suitcase (after talking about "In-flight shop")
Edgeworth:
If you could please take a look at this for me, Ms. Teneiro.
Teneiro:
Oh, that suitcase...!
Edgeworth:
Yes, about this suitcase, you are the one who designed it, correct? And I think I figured something else out about it. This suitcase is the reason you went to the shop, isn't it?
Teneiro:
.........There's nothing you won't find out eventually, is there?
Edgeworth:
Won't you please tell me more about this suitcase?
Teneiro:
Yes, um, I... Well, I... ...I was interested in seeing how the suitcases I had designed were selling! I... I know that as a service professional, I'm not supposed to care... ...but I really wanted to know! And I was glad to see that it was the last one there...!
Edgeworth:
! ("The last one there"...?)
Anything else
Teneiro:
I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth... I don't know how to answer you. As a professional flight attendant, I'm a failure...
Edgeworth:
(She must be worn out from the long question session she just went through...)
Lockers
Gumshoe:
So these are the attendants' lockers, huh? Let's hurry up and examine them, sir!
Franziska:
.........Why must men always be so rude? Besides, who exactly gave you permission to search through the attendants' lockers?
Edgeworth:
Wait, Detective! It would be uncouth of us to look in a woman's locker without her permission.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I guess so. Plus, I feel this murderous draft and I can sense a whip not far behind.
Suitcase
Edgeworth:
(It's one of those suitcases designed by Ms. Teneiro. You can tell it's hardly ever been used by the lack of even a single scratch on it.)
Edgeworth:
So you're saying, Ms. Teneiro, that the suitcase in question was the last one?
Teneiro:
Yes. They're just so popular, they're practically flying off the shelves!
Edgeworth:
(That's not exactly the impression I got...)
Teneiro:
The one in the shop is most definitely the last one!
Edgeworth:
Well, we're currently looking at that suitcase. I didn't say anything about buying it!
Teneiro:
Then say you'll buy it!
Edgeworth:
I... I'm sorry, but I can't.
Teneiro:
B...But why? I think it'd go great with your complexion, Mr. Edgeworth! It really suits you! I guarantee it personally as a service professional!
Edgeworth:
Um... Well... That is... How should I put this... ...It's hideous.
Teneiro:
Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... Maybe that was a bit too direct.) Moving on... My issue with the suitcases isn't the design, it's the number of them remaining.
Teneiro:
R-Remaining...!?
Edgeworth:
There were two suitcases in the in-flight shop when I investigated it.
Teneiro:
Two...? But that's... impossible! I'm sure there was only one...
Franziska:
Looks like her story has generated quite the contradiction.
Teneiro:
When I left the shop... ...I'm positive there was only one suitcase left!
Edgeworth:
(Something is amiss here. What could be the meaning of this inconsistency?)
Edgeworth:
(Hm?) By the way, Ms. Teneiro... What is one of those suitcases doing here?
Teneiro:
Um... That's...
Edgeworth:
I thought you said there was only one left...?
Teneiro:
Th-That one is, um... It's mine. I've used it for a very long time now.
Edgeworth:
(She's used it for a long time...? I think not.) Ms. Teneiro, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't lie to me.
Teneiro:
Excuse me!?
Edgeworth:
I don't believe for even one second that you've sued this "for a very long time"! (What proves that this hasn't been used for nearly as long as Ms. Teneiro says?)
Present price tag
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Tell me, Ms. Teneiro, is it also your habit to keep the price tag pristine on your suitcase?"
Present suitcase
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
There's hardly any dirt or grime on this suitcase! If this has been used for as long as you claim, then there should be some sign of that.
Teneiro:
Mr. Edgeworth, in case you haven't noticed, I love to clean.
Franziska:
That suitcase, the floor, and almost everything else in here sparkles. The only thing that isn't is the gray matter in your head!
Edgeworth:
(Urngh... There must be evidence that this suitcase hasn't been used before!)
Leads back to:
"(What proves that this hasn't been used for nearly as long as Ms. Teneiro says?)"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Simply by looking here, you can tell!
Teneiro:
Tell what by looking where?
Edgeworth:
Please... A simple glance won't do. Look harder.
Gumshoe:
...I don't get it either, sir!
Edgeworth:
Ah... Then I suppose I have no choice but to explain it to you once again.
Franziska:
Hmph. I suggest you take your own advice: a simple glance won't do, Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Nrghk! (She just had to figure it out... There must be something that proves this suitcase is brand new. Yes, that's exactly what I need to do!)
Leads back to:
"(What proves that this hasn't been used for nearly as long as Ms. Teneiro says?)"
Edgeworth:
Tell me, Ms. Teneiro, is it also your habit to keep the price tag pristine on your suitcase?
Teneiro:
Ah!
Franziska:
What is the meaning of this!? Why would you lie about a suitcase?
Teneiro:
............
Edgeworth:
(Despite having faith in her design sense... ...the sales numbers made her cry bitter tears. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me.) Ms. Teneiro, I think I understand. I know what you are trying to hide. Now then, this suitcase was originally in...
the flight attendants' room.
Edgeworth:
The suitcase was originally in this flight attendants' room!
Teneiro:
So now you believe what I said about it being my personal suitcase?
Edgeworth:
N-No, not at all! It was here, but then it was taken to another location, and...
Franziska:
I refuse to stand by while a villainous man vilifies a woman with such vile tactics!
Edgeworth:
(Nnngh! She's making me out to be some sort of super-villain! I need to rethink this... I have to figure out where this suitcase came from!)
Leads back to:
"Now then, this suitcase was originally in..."
the in-flight shop.
Leads to:
"Seeing as how the price tag is still on this suitcase..."
First Class.
Edgeworth:
It was originally in First Class as part of a sales campaign! But the passengers were so engrossed in the movie that you brought it back... here...
Franziska:
...And? What does that have to do with the case?
Edgeworth:
We should try to find that out. Isn't it our job to investigate these kinds of connections?
Franziska:
Then investigate it by yourself on your own time!
Edgeworth:
(Gnnrgh! I should probably rethink this... I have to figure out where this suitcase came from!)
Leads back to:
"Now then, this suitcase was originally in..."
Edgeworth:
Seeing as how the price tag is still on this suitcase... ...one can only assume it was out on the floor for sale in the shop. And the person who brought this suitcase was...
Present Rhoda Teneiro profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It was you, wasn't it, Ms. Teneiro?"
Present Cammy Meele profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Meele has a Mr. Ifly stuffed animal that she likes to carry around. If she is that much of a fan, it's only natural that it was she who bought this suitcase.
Teneiro:
She does like that doll a lot. So much so that I've had to speak with her about it... ...but she has also laughed at me on many occasions that my suitcase's design is strange.
Edgeworth:
(Come to think of it, Ms. Meele did say something to that effect in the shop...)
Franziska:
If you're done chatting, ladies, let's return to the topic at hand.
Edgeworth:
(Ladies!? Well, I never! Alright, I'll rethink things, but there really is only one point I have to focus on.) The suitcase was on sale at the in-flight shop.
Leads back to:
"And the person who brought this suitcase was..."
Present anyone else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is the person who bought the suitcase!
Franziska:
Sorry, but I don't understand your line of logic at all. Care to explain why you chose to finger that person?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. If that's how you're going to play this, then I'll admit that I was wrong!
Franziska:
Instead of basking in your "great" admission, perhaps you should spend time thinking!
Edgeworth:
(Gnnnn......! Alright, I'll rethink things, but there really is only one point I have to focus on.) The suitcase was on sale at the in-flight shop.
Leads back to:
"And the person who brought this suitcase was..."
Edgeworth:
It was you, wasn't it, Ms. Teneiro? I hate to say this, but this suitcase that you designed... ...it hasn't sold very well, has it?
Teneiro:
.........
Edgeworth:
You saw how poorly this design that you poured your heart into was selling... ...and were deeply hurt. That's why you wanted to make it look like it was selling by buying it yourself. Isn't that right?
Franziska:
Then... the reason you went to the shop and came back here was...
Teneiro:
I-I'm sorry! A-All I really have is my job... I... I was overjoyed when my design was chosen... I thought that maybe... maybe I had finally accomplished something...
Edgeworth:
But the suitcases didn't sell.
Teneiro:
It's because of the design, isn't it? All because it's as you put it, "hideous".
Edgeworth:
(I can't say they chose a great place in which to sell them, either...)
Teneiro:
We weren't selling a single one, and they were just sitting there collecting dust. I felt so bad seeing them there, day in and day out. So I decided to buy one for every flight I worked.
Edgeworth:
You buy one every single time you work a flight!?
Franziska:
I see. So in order to keep your resolution, you went and bought one today as well.
Teneiro:
Yes. And here is my receipt for that purchase.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... This receipt is clearly time stamped 5:40 AM.)
Suitcase Receipt data jotted down in my Organizer.
Teneiro:
The truth is, there's still a bunch of them left unsold. They're planning to scrap the remaining ones at the end of this flight.
Examine evidence
Front side of Suitcase Receipt
Edgeworth:
Just as Ms. Teneiro said, the timestamp says she bought the suitcase at 5:40 AM.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro, where are these other suitcases?
Teneiro:
They should all be down in the cargo hold.
Franziska:
Then the suitcase the killer used...
Edgeworth:
...Could very well have come from the cargo hold.
Teneiro:
Um, Mr. Edgeworth... You don't think that the killer used one of my suitcases to...
Edgeworth:
Yes, I do. The killer used one of your beloved suitcases... ...to move the victim's body.
Teneiro:
Aaaaah! How could they!? Those suitcases were meant to be faithful partners to our passengers on their trips. That's all I ever wished for them to be!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro, is there any other way to get to the cargo hold other than the elevator?
Teneiro:
The only other way is just through that door there.
Edgeworth:
And what about security?
Teneiro:
That door has no special lock installed, because... ...just to enter this room... ...you need a special keycard that only crew members have access to.
Edgeworth:
Which means that the culprit is someone who can enter this room... ...eliminating the passengers, and leaving only crew members as potential suspects.
Teneiro:
I-I can't believe it...
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Yes, Franziska?
Franziska:
Going on these wild goose-chases... You're a disgrace to the Von Karma name!
Edgeworth:
And what do you mean by that?
Franziska:
The suitcase came from the cargo hold. That fact alone tells the whole story.
Edgeworth:
Yes, which is why I said the culprit must be a crew member who used their keycard...
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! You're proposing that the killer rode the elevator from the cargo hold, correct?
Edgeworth:
Yes, that's the only realistic possibility.
Franziska:
The other attendant... Ms. Meele... I asked her earlier, and she had this to say.
Edgeworth:
(Franziska got information out of Ms. Meele?)
Franziska:
In order to make the elevator go down to the cargo hold... ...a different keycard is required.
Edgeworth:
A different one?
Franziska:
Yes, and the only person who holds that particular card... ...is you, Ms. Rhoda Teneiro, and only you!
Teneiro:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Edgeworth:
What!? Is this true, Ms. Teneiro!?
Teneiro:
Y-Yes... I keep that keycard in my locker at all times.
Edgeworth:
Could you please show us that card right now?
Teneiro:
Y-Yes, hold on...
Teneiro:
Aaaaah! I... I don't believe it!
Edgeworth:
What's wrong?
Teneiro:
The keycard... It's... It's gone!
Franziska:
Ha ha ha. Very clever. Pretending that your card was stolen, when in fact, you're just trying to hide it from us... You've really thought this through.
Teneiro:
W-Wait! I-It's not like that!
Franziska:
You can tell us all about what it's like down at the station. Officer! Arrest this woman!
Officer:
Yes, ma'am!
Teneiro:
M-Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
............
Franziska:
What's wrong? There's disbelief written all over your face.
Edgeworth:
Franziska, I know that you are the lead investigator on this case, however...
Franziska:
Hold it! Don't even think about wasting any more of my time.
Edgeworth:
!
Franziska:
You know the rules as well as I do. Evidence speaks louder than words. Even if this isn't a courtroom, that basic tenet still applies.
Edgeworth:
............
Franziska:
I intend to investigate the cargo hold now. What will you do, Miles Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
...I intend to do likewise.
To be continued.

(I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Rhoda Teneiro)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There is a contradiction between this piece of evidence and your testimony!
Teneiro:
I don't want to go against the word of a professional prosecutor, but... ...I don't think there's a problem at all. I swear it as a professional flight attendant.
Edgeworth:
Gnrrrk!
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Rhoda Teneiro)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Take a good look at this, for it will prove my innocence.
Teneiro:
............
Edgeworth:
............W-Well!? Say something!
Teneiro:
Ah! I'm sorry! Yes, well, I gave it a good look, but... ...no matter what angle I look at it from, I don't see how it will prove you didn't do it.
Edgeworth:
Arrrgh...! (I must've presented the wrong item...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Rhoda Teneiro)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro... What do you think about this piece of evidence?
Teneiro:
What do I think about it...? ...Oh! I'm sorry!
Edgeworth:
? Why are you apologizing?
Teneiro:
I was being unprofessional. As a pro, I should've listened to your question with a smile. And I must also answer all questions with a smile.
Edgeworth:
(Argh... Just say what you mean, that you have no answer to my question!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Zinc Lablanc II)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your testimony just now and this piece of evidence...
Lablanc:
Ah! I cannot believe how much time I have spent here! Yo will pay for this time with your piece of evidence!
Edgeworth:
Wh--!? No, stop! This is an invaluable piece of evidence!
Lablanc:
If you do not know how to use it, then give it to me! I will try to use it for you!
Edgeworth:
Ngnnrgh... I know how to use it just fine, thank you! I... I simply made a tiny error.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Zinc Lablanc II)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Lablanc, could you please take a look at this piece for me?
Lablanc:
Hmm... In American dollars... I say it is worth around... $9.99.
Edgeworth:
Wh-What are you talking about!?
Lablanc:
What are YOU talking about? Were you not intending to sell it to me?
Edgeworth:
I-It's not for sale! (I think I need to present something a bit more case-making to him.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Zinc Lablanc II)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Lablanc, your testimony just now contradicts this piece of evidence!
Lablanc:
Ah, yes, from the old word "contradictus"...
Edgeworth:
Hm...? Oh, you are correct. But what does that have to do with our present situation?
Lablanc:
The word comprised of the parts "against" and "speak". I dare say I don't deal in such double talk. My are dealings are clean!
Edgeworth:
Th-That's all well and good, however, about this piece of evide...
Lablanc:
There is no value in that! I am not interested in buying that from you!
Edgeworth:
Arrrrgh! (There's plenty of value in it, even just superficially!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Franziska von Karma)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence perfectly exposes the flaw in your logic!
Franziska:
Oh? Well then, why don't you show me how it does just that? Go on!
Gumshoe:
Ooh! I bet it's this part, right? This conflicts with something, right, sir!?
Franziska:
You have no idea what you're talking about, do you!?
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe! Don't speak up when you don't know what you're talking about!
Gumshoe:
Ouch... I was just trying to follow your head, sir...
Franziska:
That you would allow a subordinate to take over... You're a disgrace!
Edgeworth:
Gnnnnnnnnrrrrk! (I guess that wasn't it...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Franziska von Karma)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. It would seem that your logic is not as perfect as you think it is.
Franziska:
And what is that supposed to mean!?
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence should show you exactly what I mean.
Franziska:
.........Oh, yes. It clearly shows what you're thinking. That you're attempting to buy yourself time!
Edgeworth:
Gnnngh! (I knew I shouldn't have tried to pull a fast one.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Franziska von Karma)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Franziska, I believe your testimony just now conflicts with this piece of evidence.
Franziska:
And I believe that when you use the phrase "I believe", you are anything but certain. Which means that showing me that piece of evidence is just a way to waste time.
Edgeworth:
Aaaaaaaaaah! (She even managed to whip the evidence at the some time!)
Gumshoe:
Owwww!! Why did you whip me, too, sir!?
Edgeworth:
(That's one more victim besides myself and the evidence...)
Too many penalties (during Teneiro's argument)
Teneiro:
Mr. Edgeworth, I think it's about time you just admitted your guilt.
Edgeworth:
I have no reason to admit to a crime I did not commit, madam.
Teneiro:
Ah, but the well-traveled attendant inside of me knows that you're guilty. Guilty of ruining the other passengers' fun! That is a most serious crime, sir!
Edgeworth:
A s-serious crime!? Surely not...!?
Teneiro:
We've already contacted the authorities, and they will pick you up upon our arrival. And as for the rest of the passengers, I ask that you please remain seated.
Edgeworth:
I was... handed over to the police, just as Ms. Teneiro said... Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (during investigation of Lounge and Lablanc's argument)
Lablanc:
You continue to say you can prove you are not the criminal!?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Lablanc... If you could spare me a little more time...
Lablanc:
I think I have been plentiful with my patience! Any more spent time would be wasteful! You have had your chances! Even the angels have but two cheeks to strike upon!
Teneiro:
I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid it's my duty to report to the captain, Mr. Edgeworth... ...that you don't seem to be making very much progress in your investigation.
Edgeworth:
Gnrk! (Time's up...)
Lablanc:
Good! And I want to see you are handed to the police right away after the landing!
Edgeworth:
I was... handed over to the police, just as Mr. Lablanc wished... Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (during investigation of In-Flight Shop)
Meele:
*yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn* Look, Mr. Edgeworth... You're not really finding out much... ...so I'm going to go ask the captain for his permission to stop your investigation, OK?
Edgeworth:
J-Just a little more time, I beg you.
Meele:
Un huh... Don't make me upset and be a good Mr. Edgeworth, OK? Come along now and let's get you back in your seat.
Edgeworth:
Th-There is no need to push!
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (during Franziska's argument)
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth. Stop squirming and start acting like an honorable man!
Edgeworth:
Nmph... But there are still so many things I have yet to prove!
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
You should know better than that, especially as a disciple of Manfred von Karma.
Edgeworth:
(Hmph! So a "low-life criminal" like me is not worth hearing out, is that it?)
Gumshoe:
But! But Mr. Edgeworth isn't the killer...OWWWWWWWWW!!
Franziska:
I will not allow you to cover for such low-life scum, Scruffy!
Edgeworth:
I was arrested by the police on the spot... Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (in Flight Attendants' Room)
Franziska:
That's enough, Miles Edgeworth. I think we've heard plenty.
Edgeworth:
How so...?
Franziska:
Rhoda Teneiro! I'm finding quite a few points in your story a bit hard to swallow. Why not come back to the precinct with me and let's talk it over again nice and slow.
Teneiro:
I...! No! Help me, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Gnrk... Ms. Teneiro...!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Teneiro was taken into custody under the pretense of a "valuable witness". Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Nothing to Examine
Edgeworth:
There's nothing unusual about this area.
