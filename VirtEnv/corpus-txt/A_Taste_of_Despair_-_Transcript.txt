Chapter 5A Taste of Despair
Road to the Court
Luke:
What do we do now? We made it out of the courtroom but... everyone's in an uproar. So, um...where do we go from here?
Espella:
I...I'm truly...truly sorry! It's my fault that Maya... This all happened because of me!
Luke:
Th-that's not true at all! It's not your fault, Espella! I-isn't that right, Mr Wright?!
Phoenix:
............
Luke:
Uh...um...Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Huh? Uh... Oh! Luke, did you say something?
Luke:
Huh?
Phoenix:
............ Y-yeah... That's right! Espella, it's not your fault! You shouldn't blame yourself.
Luke:
...Um, Mr Wright, I just said that.
Phoenix:
Oh, really?
Espella:
Mr Wright...
Phoenix:
Well anyway, at least we managed to save you, Espella.
Espella:
Yes, but...because of that, now Maya...
Phoenix:
Maya believed in you. That's why she wanted to protect you.
Luke:
He's right! So we can't let ourselves get captured now!
Espella:
Luke...
Phoenix:
That settles that then... Okay, let's get moving! We're bound to get caught if we stick around here any longer.
Luke:
But, where should we go? Everyone's looking for us now.
Phoenix:
Well, I was thinking maybe we could go to Patty's shop...
Espella:
But the knights are certain to be waiting for us there.
Phoenix:
Oh yeah... That's true...
???:
...My, you certainly managed to get yourselves into quite the predicament.
Phoenix:
...!
Luke:
Th-that voice! Inquisitor Barnham!
Espella:
Please wait, Inquisitor Barnham! A-arrest me, lock me up, I don't care! But... these two have nothing to do with this! Take me! I'm the one you want!
Luke:
No way, Espella! None of us are at fault here! We're not the ones who did anything wrong!
Espella:
Luke...
Barnham:
You are accomplices to the Great Witch Bezella and have assisted in her escape. In a manner of speaking, you have been branded an enemy to all of Labyrinthia. ...There is nowhere you can hide.
Luke:
But... But why?! Espella isn't the Great Witch! Why can't you understand that?!
Barnham:
...Then, I must ask you... why do you continue to deny the clear allegation that this girl is Bezella?
Luke:
That's easy! Because we believe in her. I know back in the courtroom...I said I didn't believe in Maya but... Deep down, I believed in her... We all did and we all still do!
Espella:
Luke...
Luke:
That's why I'm going to stand strong. I'm going to stick by Espella's side no matter what!
Barnham:
............ ...Is that so? By the way...Sir Blue Knight.
Phoenix:
............
Barnham:
The loss of Maya Fey is...unfortunate.
Phoenix:
............
Barnham:
You...have my deepest sympathies.
Phoenix:
............ Really? Your..."deepest sympathies"?
Barnham:
While such bedlam was indeed unexpected, we should have done something more to prevent it.
Phoenix:
...Inquisitor Barnham. I proved Maya's innocence...
Barnham:
I admit, indeed you did.
Phoenix:
And yet, last I saw she was being dropped into a pit of fire. Tell me, Inquisitor... Does that seem like "justice" to you?
Barnham:
............
Phoenix:
All witches are to be cast into the flames... That's the law of the land around here, right? But... Maya WASN'T a witch! How do you explain that, Inquisitor Barnham?!
Barnham:
...It is truly regrettable. What occurs in the courtroom... is my responsibility and mine alone.
Phoenix:
"Responsibility"? ...Fine! Then take some "responsibility" right now! Magic exists here, right? Well then...use some magic and bring Maya back! Cast whatever spell you need to cast... and BRING HER BACK!
Barnham:
............ There exists no such magic. I cannot undo her death.
Espella:
............
Luke:
............
Barnham:
............ ...'Tis my blame to bear. If it would bring you solace, then take this sword and strike me...
Phoenix:
Just stop it! You knights are always ready to get rid of those different from yourselves... Just...get out of my sight. ...I said GO!
Barnham:
............
...What was that...? I think I heard something coming from the main gate...
...Guards! Come and take a look at this!
Luke:
M-Mr Wright! Those voices are getting closer! At this rate, we're...
Barnham:
............ Exit through the main gate and head east through the forest. You should be able to escape along the small path there.
Luke:
...Huh?!
Barnham:
On the outskirts of the city, you will find Rouge's tavern... You should be safe there.
Luke:
Wh-why are you helping...
Barnham:
Go! Now! You will be caught if you stay here... and this will be all for naught!
Espella:
Luke! Mr Wright! L-let's go!
Luke:
Y-yeah, right! U-um...Mr Wright? Are you coming?
Phoenix:
............ ...Okay. Let's go!
A new destination has been added to the map: Marketplace.
Examine
Zacharias Barnham
Barnham:
Rouge's tavern is just through that forest. Now go! It is the only haven you have right now. You should be well hidden there. Go. Quickly.
Zacharias Barnham (subsequent times)
Barnham:
What are you doing?! Be gone with you! Hurry and get to Rouge's tavern. It is just through the forest path!
Tree foliage on far left
Luke:
I've got a bad feeling about this. Not that I'm scared, of course. My legs are shaking from the cold wind.
Espella:
I...I think someone's staring at us in the darkness.
Phoenix:
Did you hear that? Hmm, I think it was just the wind...hopefully...
Stone lantern
Espella:
Everyone leaving the courthouse has to pass through here. Let's hurry!
Luke:
It's so bright here, making everything else seem jet black.
Arrows on signpost
Phoenix:
There are houses in that direction, too.
Luke:
Let's go the other way, away from the town!
Espella:
The place Sir Barnham told us to go to is some distance away from the shopping district.
Marketplace
Luke:
It looks like we made it through the forest... I can't see those knights anywhere.
Espella:
I think we'll be safe here for a little while.
Phoenix:
............ I'm sorry for all of this, Espella.
Espella:
Huh...?
Phoenix:
If we'd just headed for safety right away, we wouldn't be in this situation.
Espella:
Mr Wright...
Phoenix:
I need to apologise to you too, Luke.
Luke:
Wha...?
Phoenix:
You've been trying your best this whole time. Just to get Espella out of here safely. It's my fault those knights are on our tail and are probably going to find us.
Luke:
But...I wouldn't say all's lost just yet! I mean...there's got to be a way to bring Maya back... I'm sure we can find a way.
Phoenix:
............ (C'mon Phoenix... You have to keep it together here! These two need you now more than ever!)
Luke:
Well then... How about we make our way to that tavern Inquisitor Barnham mentioned?
Espella:
...Yes, that would be Rouge's tavern. I can show you the way.
Luke:
Huh? Hey, Espella...you know that place?
Espella:
Oh, yes... It looks a little bit scary, so I've never been inside before, though. But...I come to this side of town often to do my shopping, so I've passed it a few times. ...Um, I think Ms Mary's goat farm is around here as well.
Luke:
I-is that right...?
Espella:
Okay. It's just this way... Let's go!
Luke:
Right then. Let's get going, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah... Hey, Luke.
Luke:
Yes? What is it?
Phoenix:
...I just wanted to thank you for earlier. You really helped me out.
Luke:
Wh-what do you mean?
Phoenix:
...See, I get it now. I'm...not the only one who's just lost someone important to them.
Luke:
......... I believe in the professor. He would never be beaten by something like "magic". ...That witch just cast a spell on him, that's all. So...all we have to do is find a way to undo that spell, right?!
Phoenix:
I see... You know, you're right, Luke.
Luke:
The professor will come back, I'm sure of it! That's why...all I can do for now is keep moving forward. It's what any true gentleman in training would do!
Phoenix:
Yeah...I get it. Okay then, let's go.
Luke:
Right!
Espella:
What's wrong, you two? It's over this way! Hurry up!
Phoenix:
Oh, sorry about that! We're coming!

Luke, check this out. It looks like there's a puzzle hidden here.
Luke:
I'm on it, Mr Wright! Make way for the ace apprentice!
Phoenix:
Hold on, Luke. I think I'd like to try this one.
Luke:
Really, Mr Wright? Okay! Good luck! I'll be here if you need me!

Fruit vendor on mid-left
Luke:
A wide assortment of edibles is laid out on the food stand.
Espella:
It's something like a black market. People sell whatever they can get their hands on.
Phoenix:
Guys, we need to hurry. You can come enjoy the sights later.
Area above roof windows of center-right house
Phoenix:
Never before did house lights look so warm and welcoming.
Espella:
I miss Aunt Patty...and Eve... What are they doing right now?
Luke:
It's time for dinner... You can't help feeling hungry even when you're depressed.
Vendor on right
Espella:
It's a tool shop.
Phoenix:
Anything useful here? ...Nope.
Luke:
The shopkeeper's not here. Let's come back tomorrow.
Seedy Alley
Luke:
Whoooooa!
Espella:
Luke, what's wrong?!
Luke:
S-sorry about that, Espella. I just tripped a little, that's all.
Espella:
Hm? Is this...a potato?
Luke:
Let's see if we can put this back into the basket. Wouldn't want anyone else to trip over it. Crikey, this place really looks like it's seen better days...
???:
Hey, hey, hey! What's with all this racket?!
Luke:
S-someone's coming!
Cutter:
This ain't no place fer kids! Why don't you tykes run off and find somewhere else to play, eh?
Luke:
Oh! It's you!
Cutter:
...Hm? Ho ho! You're that lad from yesterday, ain't you?!
Espella:
Is he an acquaintance of yours, Luke?
Cutter:
Not JUST an acquaintance! This lad and the bloke in the dark hat. They... They're my saviours! Them two really saved my hide yesterday! These two pulled my fat outta the fryer right when I needed it most!
Luke:
(I guess that's one way of putting it...) It's all right, Espella. This man is really a good person.
Cutter:
Ho ho! That's right, lass! Ol' Cutter has a face you can trust! Hang on... Where is the bloke with the dark hat, anyway?
Luke:
Oh... Um, well you see...the professor... He... .........
Cutter:
...Somethin' mighty unpleasant must've happened from the looks of it. How abouts we take the conversation inside, eh?
Luke:
When you say inside...that wouldn't happen to be Rouge's tavern, would it?
Cutter:
Ho ho! Hey now! Didn't think you'd know about a place like that! I betcha you must be quite the heartbreaker with the lasses!
Luke:
That's not it at all! We just have a bit of business to take care of there, that's all.
Cutter:
All right, all right. Just pullin' yer leg, lad. Well, if you're lookin' for Rouge's tavern, yer standin' right in front of it! It's the brightest house on this road. Y'can't miss it! No worries, though. I'll head there with you guys.
Espella:
Thank you very much!

Cutter:
Rouge's tavern is just up ahead. It's the one beaming with light. Can't miss it!
Chair and crate on left
Luke:
Mind your feet, everybody! The ground is littered with sharp-looking objects.
Phoenix:
Ouch! I hurt my foot...
Tavern roof
Espella:
What a cheerful, lively place!
Phoenix:
Somehow, that's the only brightly lit area.
Windows on right
Luke:
The lights are off...The gloom is a little unsettling.
Espella:
I miss the comfort of light, too. Darkness makes me uneasy...
Tavern
Luke:
Wow... It sure is lively in here!
Espella:
It certainly is. Even more so than I thought. It's so cheerful, and everyone seems to be having a good time.
Cutter:
See, it ain't just the shadiest of the shady that hang about here. Well, y'do get the occasional rabble-rouser every now and then... But for the most part, everyone here's good people. You'll find the head honcho herself over behind the counter. Why not go introduce yourselves?

Rouge
Leads to:
"Ho ho! Boss Lady! I come bearing customers for ya!"
Dartboard
Phoenix:
Don't you usually use DARTS on a dartboard? Ah, what's the use?
Luke:
Knives as darts... It really does seem like something out of a fantasy book, doesn't it?
Espella:
The atmosphere in here is so different from the town square... I wonder if we'll be all right here?
Chandelier
Luke:
D-did it just sway, Mr Wright? ...I sure hope this doesn't get loose and fall.
Espella:
How pretty! It's not every day you see a chandelier like that around here.
Phoenix:
If Maya were here, I bet she'd be trying to jump up and take one of those candles...
Wall of casks
Luke:
Wow, look at all those bottles. I wonder if that's a whole day's worth of juice...?
Espella:
It's a bit funny imagining Inquisitor Barnham sitting here with a tall glass of tomato juice, isn't it?
Phoenix:
It'd be funny just watching him try to sit in one of these chairs with that armour of his.
Cutter:
Ho ho! Boss Lady! I come bearing customers for ya!
Rouge:
Turn the volume down, before you scare away all my other customers. Use your indoor voice, remember? ..."Customers", you say?
Cutter:
Now, I sorta sprung this on you and I know they're just a bunch of kids, but that lad there is my saviour! Hand to heart! So do me a favour and get the lad a juice. It's on me! Just put it on my tab!
Rouge:
I don't care about that! Did you take a look at that girl? What the heck were you thinking?!
Cutter:
...Eh?
Rouge:
Do you have a loaf of bread for a brain or something! [sic] You fool!
Cutter:
Huh?!
Rouge:
That girl...is suspected of being the Great Witch Bezella!
Cutter:
B-B-B-B-Bezella?! Are you joking?! I didn't know that!
Luke:
Now, see here! Espella is NOT Bezella!
Phoenix:
...We were the ones that proved her innocence and cleared her of the charges.
Cutter:
S-see, Boss Lady?! The lad agrees she's not Bezella! And besides, I knew the girl was innocent from the moment I laid eyes on her!
Rouge:
...Cutter, your judgement is about as reliable as paper shoes in the rain. What I'd like to know is who told you three to come here in the first place?
Espella:
It was...Inquisitor Barnham.
Rouge:
...! Really now...? So, it was him, was it? You guys... Listen, don't say a word of this to anyone else, you hear me? It could make life very difficult for our dear inquisitor.
Phoenix:
Ah... R-right. Got it...
Rouge:
I don't know what he expects me to do with you guys, but... Fine. I'll lend you a hand. You can stay here for the night. There's an empty room you can use upstairs. We don't exactly get the cleanliest types staying here, so forgive the mess. Should be good enough to sleep in, though.
Luke:
Thank you very much!
Phoenix:
...We really appreciate it.
Espella:
Um... Thank you so much.
Rouge:
Don't get the wrong idea, kiddos. This place ain't a charity. I expect you to return the favour some day!
Luke:
Phew, I'm sure glad Rouge turned out to be such a nice person!
Espella:
Yes. Mr Cutter and Miss Rouge are both very kind.
Luke:
It looks like we can rest easy for now! Right, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Yup. And I guess we can take this time to do a little sleuthing too, if we want to. But we should probably rest while we can. Tomorrow is going to be a pretty hectic day.
Luke:
Now that's an idea I can get behind!
A new destination has been added to the map: Sculptor's Room.
Examine
Second-floor railing on right
Leads to:
"This must be it... So this is the room Rouge was talking about, huh?"
Cutter
Cutter:
This place is where folks like me can come and be ourselves. Boss Lady is always helpin' out anyone that's in trouble. I know she seems a little rough at first, but I always knew she'd end up helpin' you lot in the end.
Luke:
Everyone here really trusts Rouge, don't they?
Cutter:
No doubt about it, lad! And, you know? A gal like that sure demands attention, if you catch my drift.
Luke:
I-I, umm... I don't really think I fully understand what you mean...
Cutter:
Gah, ha ha ha! Still a bit too green fer that, eh, lad? Oh! Would you look at the time? Best get ready for bed! Your room is upstairs. It's a bit messy, though. Hope you don't mind! Anyway, just enjoy your stay and relax! If you get sleepy, just head on upstairs!
Cutter (subsequent times)
Cutter:
Your room is upstairs. Don't mind the mess. Just enjoy and relax!
Rouge
Luke:
Do you and Inquisitor Barnham know each other?
Rouge:
Hm, I guess you could say that.
Luke:
Is...that right? It's just a bit surprising, I guess... I mean, Inquisitor Barnham is head of the Knights, and you're...
Rouge:
Some ne'er-do-well tavern owner, right? Well, can't fault you for stating facts, kid!
Luke:
...You may both be different, but I get the feeling you really trust one another.
Rouge:
Zack is...well, different from all the other knights in Labyrinthia. To any other knight, we're nothing more than a bunch of filthy no-good scum. We're the first ones to blame whenever a crime or anything happens out in the town.
Luke:
That's true. Mr Cutter didn't do anything wrong when the professor and I gave him a hand.
Rouge:
Yup. Society judges us very harshly, y'see. But Zack...he's fair. He doesn't judge anyone based on how "innocent" or "shady" they may look or what sort of job they've got. He's only interested in protecting the town with fair and sound judgement. That's why he always helps us out.
Luke:
Interesting... Like I thought, he really is a good person...
Rouge:
Hm? Did you say something?
Luke:
Ah, no... It's nothing.
Rouge:
Well, I think that's my cue. You take it easy and rest up, okay? If Zack told you to hide out here, then I really doubt the knights will come snooping around. And even if they did come here, we sure as heck wouldn't turn you over to the likes of them.
Luke:
That's good to know! Thank you again, Miss Rouge! You're really too kind.
Rouge:
Heh, for such a little guy you sure do know how to keep a level head in a tough spot. Your friend over there, on the other hand... I haven't heard a peep from him this whole time.
Luke:
It's fine. I'm sure he'll be right as rain tomorrow...
Rouge:
Hm...
Rouge (subsequent times)
Rouge:
What's up? You look a little thirsty. How about I pour you a glass of fresh juice?
Luke:
Oh wow! That'd be great!
Sculptor's Room
Luke:
This must be it... So this is the room Rouge was talking about, huh?
Espella:
Oh my... It is...quite unique, isn't it?
Phoenix:
(Is that...a statue in the corner? How very...err, "avant garde".)
Luke:
That statue really looks a lot like Mr Cutter, doesn't it...? ...Hey, I wonder if he made this himself.
Espella:
Not only is Mr Cutter very nice, it seems he's quite artistic as well.
Phoenix:
(I dunno if I'd call this "art", per se.) Anyway, it's just nice to have a safe place to rest for a while.
Luke:
Uh-huh! We did so much running about today. I'm totally exhausted.
Phoenix:
I think we can plan out our next step in the morning. Let's try and get some rest.
Espella:
Right.
............ ...Maya... ...If only...I'd been able... ...to save you... ...It never would have come to this... ............
Phoenix:
...Just great. I should be ready to pass out right now. ...But I just can't fall asleep. I'm a little thirsty... Maybe I should go grab some water.
Tavern
Phoenix:
It looks like the party is over. Everyone must have gone home by now... I'll just grab some water and head back to the room.
Examine
Rouge
Leads to:
"What's up? Can't get to sleep?"
Dartboard
Phoenix:
Don't you usually use DARTS on a dartboard? Ah, what's the use?
Chandelier
Phoenix:
If Maya were here, I bet she'd be trying to jump up and take one of those candles...
Wall of casks
Phoenix:
*knock* *knock* ...Sounds like it's all tapped out. People here sure do love their tomato juice...
Rouge:
What's up? Can't get to sleep?
Phoenix:
...Yeah. I'm absolutely beat, but I just can't keep my eyes shut.
Rouge:
Hm...you don't say?
Phoenix:
It looks like you've got your work cut out for you cleaning up this place. Do you need a hand?
Rouge:
Nah, it's fine. The house rule is: "you [sic] make a mess, you clean it". But those dummies couldn't keep their eyes open. I'll make 'em clean up in the morning.
Phoenix:
...Huh? So, hasn't everyone gone home?
Rouge:
I couldn't exactly let them go home in that state, so I shoved them all upstairs for the night. This is both their home and shelter. I mean, don't tell me you can't hear their loud snoring from down here...
Phoenix:
(...And here I thought that was my stomach growling this whole time...)
Rouge:
...So? You must have come down here for something, right?
Phoenix:
Oh yeah...that's right. I came down for a glass of water.
Rouge:
Hm... All right. But, you'll have to earn it first. You win at my game and I'll get you any drink you want. On the house.
Phoenix:
Did you say...game? Um...what kind of a game?
Rouge:
...SILENCE!
Phoenix:
(Whoa, now that...was totally unexpected...) U-um...I'm really sorry... If I said something wrong...
Rouge:
Now, don't you go getting the wrong idea. I only drew this knife... to use in this puzzle I've made for you!

Rouge:
Heh. Not too shabby, tiger. Well, a promise is a promise. You can have any drink you want, no charge. Refills included. Just say the word.
Phoenix:
Thank you... I think I'll take you up on that offer...
Rouge:
You earned it, y'know. Never saw anyone around these parts take down a puzzle like that so fast.
Phoenix:
Ah ha. It was pure luck, trust me. If you want a puzzle expert, Luke is the one to talk to.
Rouge:
Oh? You mean that sharp-looking kid, right? You know, for someone so young, he's got a good head on his shoulders, that one. It looks like he's been through a lot...
Phoenix:
Yeah...he sure has. He seems to be in good spirits, but... deep inside he must be hurting really bad. He just lost someone very dear to him... But he's trying so hard to hide it.
Rouge:
...
Phoenix:
Then there's Espella... She had a new accusation thrown at her and is again at risk of being burned alive. And...Maya. I can't stop thinking how her death was completely my fault... That's why I need to be stronger... But I can't. I just feel so...hopeless. I'm the only one who can protect Luke and Espella. ...But I'm scared. I'm scared that what happened to Maya will happen again...
Rouge:
...Maya, huh? I caught wind of what happened today in court. She seemed...very important to you.
Phoenix:
... I'm...all right. I'm just...not sure I can protect those two. More than that... I just don't want them to think I might fail them.
Rouge:
............ You want to protect them...and don't want them to think you'll fail...huh? That all sounds well and good. ...But you want to know what I think? I think you're just telling yourself what you want to hear.
Phoenix:
Huh? What do you mean?
Rouge:
I think the words coming out of your mouth right now are downright selfish.
Phoenix:
H-hey, what are you...
Rouge:
Have you taken a second to step back from your wallowing and think how worried they must be about you right now?
Phoenix:
...
Rouge:
So it's hopeless, huh? Do you think those kids are hopeless too? Pssh, don't make me laugh! You wanna see hopeless? That's easy. Just take a look in the mirror.
Phoenix:
...!
Rouge:
How do you expect to protect those two if you can't even manage to get a hold of yourself?
Phoenix:
I-I...
Rouge:
...It's okay. I get it. You had some really...really rough stuff happen to you today. Unimaginably sad, emotionally trying stuff.
Phoenix:
......
Rouge:
That's why the first thing you need to do... is just accept it. Accept it all. The sadness, the remorse...everything. Honestly, I don't blame you for expressing just how hard this whole situation has been on you. Who could?
Phoenix:
...... ...I... I can never forgive myself for letting this happen... I couldn't do anything...not a single thing! I did nothing to help Maya at all... Maya... She gave her own life to save Espella! If only I'd been quicker... If only I could've done something... Maya would still be... ...She'd still be here by my side... ...... It's all my fault... ......
Rouge:
......
Luke:
......
Espella:
...Oh, Luke. What are you doing here?
Luke:
Ah...Espella. What are you doing up at this time?
Espella:
I couldn't sleep. I thought I'd just get a glass of water... Huh? Who's that over there? Is that... Miss Rouge and Mr Wright?
Luke:
Uh... Hey, we should head back to bed, Espella! We have an early start tomorrow, after all!
Espella:
Mmm. You're right.
Luke:
...... Mr Wright...
Examine
Second-floor railing on right
Leads to:
"...Mr Wright."
Rouge
Phoenix:
U-um... Rouge, I just wanted to thank you... You know, for hearing me out.
Rouge:
Pfft, no need for formalities. We did just share a puzzle, after all. Anyways, go on and get some rest. Something tells me you'll need it.
Phoenix:
Okay. I'll do just that. ...Good night, Rouge.
Rouge:
Hm... Night.

Phoenix:
Looks like this statue is still a work-in-progress. Makes a great hammock support, though.

Phoenix:
Oh...sorry, Luke, did I wake you up? ...Is Espella still asleep?
Luke:
Yup. She's out like a light. She must have been really tired.
Phoenix:
Yeah...
Luke:
Um...Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Hm?
Luke:
Starting tomorrow... I'm going to give 110...no, 210 per cent!
Phoenix:
Wh-whoa! Where'd that come from all of a sudden?
Luke:
I...just want to help you stay focused, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Luke...
Luke:
I'm sure with Espella and me on your side, we can take on anything that comes our way! There's no puzzle out there tough enough to stop the likes of us!
Phoenix:
Ha ha. No puzzle too tough, huh? That sure sounds like the Luke I know.
Luke:
Ah ha... I guess it does, huh?
Phoenix:
Luke...you've really helped me get back on my feet. I can definitely see why you're the professor's apprentice.
Luke:
That I am!
Phoenix:
Let's give it our best, Luke. As an ace attorney and an ace apprentice.
Luke:
Right you are!
Phoenix:
All right, so...what do you say we get some rest, huh?
Luke:
...I'm all for that! Good night, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Good night, Luke.
Audience Room
Storyteller:
...The next parade is the most crucial one yet.
Darklaw:
Yes, Milord. I understand.
Storyteller:
I leave the rest in your hands. Please take care of Espella.
Darklaw:
...Yes.
Storyteller:
You have had to endure much thus far... but understand that the end is near.
Darklaw:
...Indeed.
Storyteller:
Hmph... Oh, I see...
Darklaw:
...?
Storyteller:
Is that a hint of contempt I see in you, Inquisitor Darklaw...? Urk-!
Darklaw:
...!
Storyteller:
...I must rest.
Audience Rm. Entrance
Darklaw:
...What a foolish man. You...will know soon enough. Soon you will see the advent of a new story. And you will pay for all of your mistakes...
???:
Huh? ...The advent of a new story?
Barnham:
I wonder... What could she be planning?
It's true. Strange things have been occurring within the Story. Such as the Storyteller making Espella Cantabella, his own daughter, a witch... Why would he write such a thing... Something is not right. ...Should I investigate further...?
Sculptor's Room
Phoenix:
Good morning, Luke, Espella. Did you guys sleep all right?
Espella:
Yes, thank you. I slept very well.
Luke:
Me too! I'm recharged and ready to get started, Mr Wright!
Phoenix:
It looks like someone got plenty of rest last night.
Luke:
That's right! A lack of sleep leads to a weary mind, after all!
Phoenix:
Okay, guys. Let's decide on where we should investigate first.
Luke:
Well, it would probably be safer if we avoid going into the town centre for now...
Espella:
That's right. Inquisitor Barnham did say there was "nowhere we could hide"...
Phoenix:
All right then, let's just stick to this area and see what information we can find. That Great Witch Bezella has to be a pretty important part of Labyrinthia's history.
Luke:
Right you are! I mean, she is called the "legendary" Great Witch... I'm confident someone can tell us something!
Phoenix:
Yeah... There's bound to be a clue out there somewhere that can shed some light on this thing.
Luke:
I think you're right. Detective Accidenti mentioned some things about Labyrinthia in his letter to the professor, too... He wrote that this town is shrouded in secrecy. And where there are secrets, you can bet there are clues.
Phoenix:
...We should investigate this area first. There are no knights patrolling around here. I guess they really do avoid this part of town, huh? I'm sure we can get a lot of information from the townsfolk.
Luke:
Now that you mention it, isn't this near where Espella had that run-in with those two guys?
Espella:
Yes, it is. It's about halfway from the marketplace.
Luke:
Then in that case, I think there's a possibility we'll find someone with a connection to what's happened. And that means more information on the witches for us!
Phoenix:
You got it, Luke. We've got two weeks to gather as much information as possible.
Luke:
O-oh nooooo. That's right!
Phoenix:
What's wrong, Luke?
Luke:
I didn't mean to startle anyone. I...just forgot to mention... The next parade...isn't actually in two weeks...
Phoenix:
Huh...? I-it's not...?
Luke:
That no-good Storyteller changed the date of the parade by writing in his book! He just changed it right there in front of us!
Phoenix:
He rewrote the Story? Then... when exactly...is the next parade?
Luke:
Weeeeeell...it's... it's sort of...actually today, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! D-did you just say..."today"? (N-no way! Man, talk about time slipping away...)
Espella:
I think they've already started preparing for the festival! It looks like...it might start this evening.
Phoenix:
J-just our luck...
Luke:
M-Mr Wright...?
Phoenix:
............ Okay, this gives us all the more reason to start investigating right away.
Luke:
...!
Phoenix:
Let's see what kind of clues we can find today while there's still time. I'm sure we can find something on the Great Witch Bezella.
Luke:
Y-yes, you're right!
Espella:
Okay! Let's do our best to find some clues!

Phoenix:
Wow, a puzzle there of all places? You can find these puzzles just about anywhere, huh?

Espella:
A sword and a hatchet? Hmm... Not very surprising to find something like that in a place like this, is it?
Phoenix:
I'm no sword expert, but even I can tell the difference between these and something like Barnham's.
Luke:
I can't imagine why you'd ever need a sword this...aggressive, can you, Mr Wright?
Upper body of statue on left
Espella:
This statue looks an awful lot like Mr Cutter, don't you think?
Phoenix:
Looks like this statue is still a work-in-progress. Makes a great hammock support, though.
Luke:
I have a sneaking suspicion the sculptor greatly exaggerated whoever this is supposed to be.
Top of limestone carving block on right
Luke:
Someone must be working on another statue... They must've just started it recently.
Espella:
I think so too, Luke. I can't even tell what this is supposed to be.
Phoenix:
I'm guessing it's supposed to be a person. Something tells me they won't be finishing any time soon.
Tavern
Rouge:
Espella. Hold on a second.
Espella:
H-huh...? M-me?
Rouge:
Think you could give me a hand around the place? Things have got a bit busier around here, and I'm a bit short-staffed at the moment.
Espella:
But I have to...
Luke:
Miss Rouge, we really have to get going...
Phoenix:
Actually...that might be a good idea. What do you think, Espella?
Espella:
Umm... Well...
Phoenix:
You'd definitely be a lot safer here. Just leave the investigation to us.
Espella:
...Okay. If you think that's best. Just...both of you be careful out there!
Phoenix:
Of course. We'll be back soon with lots of info!
Luke:
Is it really okay to just leave Espella here, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
I don't think Rouge really needed any help. I think she's actually looking out for Espella.
Luke:
Huh? She is?
Phoenix:
Espella has just been accused of being Bezella... Who knows what would happen if she set foot outside in the town?
Luke:
Oh...
Phoenix:
Espella's already been through so much. I don't think angry villagers and knights with sharp swords are gonna help her. Looks like this investigation is on us, Luke. Let's get out there and find ourselves some clues.
Luke:
The ace attorney and ace apprentice are on the case!
Examine
Rouge
Rouge:
You can let me take care of Espella. It's best you two focus on your investigation.
Phoenix:
Thanks a lot, Rouge.
Rouge:
Heh... Well now, someone looks happier than a kid in a candy shop.
Phoenix:
A-ah ha ha... Well, I have you to thank for that.
Luke:
Hm? What do you mean, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
I-it's nothing.
Luke:
...?
Rouge:
That reminds me, I have another cunningly crafted puzzle for you to try. Think you've got what it takes to solve it?
Phoenix:
Um...well, Luke would be better suited for it. He's the puzzle master here.
Luke:
Puzzle? Did you say puzzle?! Just leave it to me, Mr Wright!
Phoenix:
There. You see, Rouge?
Rouge:
I hate to disappoint you, kiddo. But this puzzle is best left to us grown-ups. Now, go on and show the boy what you've got. Let's get started!

Nicely done yet again. You know, that's freshly squeezed tomato juice in that chalice. You can drink it, if you want.
Phoenix:
Tomato juice, huh? Thanks for the offer, but I'm more of a grape juice guy, myself...
Luke:
But wait, if that's tomato juice, why can only grown-ups try solving this puzzle?
Rouge:
Them's the rules. There's a tale that says the one who can successfully slide the red glass and solve the puzzle... will fall in love with their soulmate.
Luke:
...Whoa, really? Mr Wright, you and Rouge have become fast friends, haven't you? Do you think you'll both find your soulmates?
Phoenix:
...No, Luke. I can say with certainty, I don't think so.
Luke:
...?
Rouge (subsequent times)
Rouge:
Espella's fine. Just let me take care of her. You boys have things you need to take care of, don't you? Now go on, get to it.
Bardly
Bardly:
............
Luke:
B-Bardly? What are you doing in a place like this? Oh, I know! I bet you perform here, don't you?
Bardly:
Yes, indeed... My tantalisingly tasteful tunes reach even the most dubious parts of Labyrinthia. This tavern is home to a variety of musical palettes...
Phoenix:
Say, you're not the only bard in town, are you? There's that other guy...Birdly, right?
Bardly:
Good sir! The mere mention of that fowl-loving fellow fiddler wounds me greatly! ............ And now, a song.
A rival of mine in this town doth play. His outfit absurd, his rhymes most cliché♪ He stood there in court, parrot by his side. For there was a witch who had to be tried♪
Phoenix:
("Rival"...? Sheesh... Never would've thought being a bard would be so hard♪)
Bardly:
And just overnight, a star did he become. The town was abuzz... He gets all the fun♪
Hence why, good sirs... In the town square I play and I play, yet not a single soul pays heed to my dulcet tones!
Luke:
I see. So you're saying that Birdly stole the stage from you, is that it?
Bardly:
Yes! Quite! Can you see how terribly tragic... How tragically terrible his magic?!♪
But then, I was suddenly struck with an idea, as if from the Storyteller himself...
The problem is that I do not have the melodious musical accompaniment of a parrot, unlike you-know-who!♪
Luke:
So, you think you need a parrot too?
Bardly:
If I could get my musical minstrel mitts on TWO parrots...
it would surely send my popularity amongst the people sky high!♪

Luke:

There are simply too many adorable parrots to choose from. I cannot decide which I want!♪ I want them all to sing with meeeeeeee!♪
Phoenix:
Now that IS something I would pay to see.

There is but one thing which I do not doubt. A parrotly pair will turn my luck about!♪
Espella Cantabella
Espella:
......
Luke:
What's wrong, Espella?
Espella:
Oh, no... Nothing's wrong. I was just reminiscing about the old days.
Phoenix:
The old days?
Espella:
Yes. You know, about the bakery and how we used to bake bread... I think I'd like to bake some sweet, lovely bread for all of the sweet, lovely people here at the tavern... If they let me, of course. I learned everything about baking from Aunt Patty. I used to always watch her making delicious bread and pastries. But out of everything we baked, the sweet banana bread was my specialty.
Luke:
Aww. It's too bad we didn't get a chance to try any of your baking, Espella!
Phoenix:
(Am I the only one having a hard time picturing these guys munching on "sweet, lovely" banana bread?)
Espella Cantabella (subsequent times)
Espella:
Good luck on the investigation, you two.
Luke:
Thanks! We'll let you know if we find out anything!
Cutter
Cutter:
Hello there, lads! I take it you slept like rocks last night?
Phoenix:
Definitely. Thanks a lot. But I, uhh...have to say the room was definitely..."unique". I mean, especially that statue...
Cutter:
Ha ha! So you noticed! Why, that's where I keep all of my artistic works-in-progress! Betcha you lot must've felt mighty safe sleeping under my stone brother's watchful eye, eh?!
Phoenix:
If by "safe" you mean "kind of creeped out", then yes...never felt "safer".
Luke:
Hey, Mr Cutter, do you happen to be a sculptor?
Cutter:
Ho ho! Sharp as a whip, you are, lad! That's right! I'm the best sculptor in all of Labyrinthia! 'Least I think so... Thing is, there's a rumour goin' around that modelling for my sculptures ain't none too good for yer health, if you catch my drift.
Phoenix:
I-I think so... That, uhh...sounds kind of ominous.
Cutter:
So not many people wanna be models. That's why I've got no choice but to rely on the ol' noggin here.
Luke:
Wow! You mean you sculpt from memory? You must be incredibly gifted, Mr Cutter!
Cutter:
Hah! Allow me to demonstrate, lad! HAAAAA!
Luke:
Th-that was amazing! You sculpted that statue in no time! You didn't stop once!
Phoenix:
By the way, who is this supposed to be? (I feel like I've seen him somewhere before...)
Cutter:
This bloke? He's an old friend o' mine. Well, WAS an old friend o' mine. Gone now.
Luke:
I-I see...
Cutter:
Aye! So, whaddya say? How about a complimentary sculpture from yours truly?
Phoenix:
............ Ahh...I think we'll pass.
Cutter (subsequent times)
Cutter:
Next time I'll do a sculpture of you lads! All from memory, of course!

Cinderellia

Oh my. How ever were you fine gentle sirs able to notice me way up here on the balcony?
Luke:
A-apologies, miss. We didn't mean to disturb you... Wow, what a fancy dress. I didn't think we would find royalty living on this side of town! Right, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
(Yeah, it's fancy...in the absolute loosest sense of the word...)
Cinderellia:
Please, oh gentle sir... Do not think ill of me simply because of these makeshift rags I am forced to wear.
Phoenix:
Huh? Me?! No, no! Don't be ridiculous!
Cinderellia:
Now that I look at you, gentle sir...I am ever so certain we are kindred spirits, you and I.
Luke:
"Kindred"...?
Cinderellia:
Oh, indeed, gentle sir. Could it be that you, too, have fled from whence you called home? No doubt you have noticed the state of my attire. It is ever so much in need of good cleaning and repair... But truly, I hail from an ever so noble family... I dare say you did not think yourself to be in the presence of royalty, did you? Hee hee.
Phoenix:
(Look around you... Do you really want to be saying that "ever so" loudly in a place like this?)

A marketplace...? That sounds like fun.
Phoenix:
How about we take a look around while we check for clues?
Luke:
Umm...but, Mr Wright... We have to make sure we focus on the investigation as well, okay?
Phoenix:
(Wow. Luke is super serious...)
Luke:
...Huh? Hey, Mr Wright... Look! Isn't that...Mr Knightle and Miss Mary standing over there?
Phoenix:
Oh yeah... Now that you mention it, Espella did say that Ms Mary's farm is somewhere around here, didn't she? (I don't see any knights around anywhere... I wonder what Knightle is doing here.)
Examine
Mary
Mary:
Fresh milk! Fresh milk of Labyrinthia! You won't find a baaaaaaaargain like this anywhere else. Oh? We meet again. Are you here to purchase some of my fine milk?
Phoenix:
Oh, I'm afraid not...sorry. We'll be sure to pick some up next time. Anyway...you didn't happen to see any knights come by here, did you?
Mary:
Knights? No, not today. Speaking of which... I heard there was a BIG to-do over at the witch trial last night. You...wouldn't have something to do with that, now would you?
Phoenix:
N-no, no! Ha ha! We didn't do a thing, did we, Luke?
Luke:
Th-that's right! We didn't do anything, honest!
Mary:
Well, okay. That's a relief. We wouldn't want Mummy's little milk muffin getting all spooked because of your antics, now would we?

I shall never forget that fateful day. That...fateful witch trial... Truth is, the following morning... I...I had my entrance exam to join the order of knights.
Phoenix:
...I-is that right?
Knightle:
But...the night of THAT trial... What happened in THAT courtroom... THAT was also the night you made me a complete laughing stock! And not only that! Because you dragged that trial so late into the night, I overslept!
Luke:
So, you must have ended up being late to your exam, huh?
Phoenix:
...That's totally not my fault.
Luke:
Umm, well... Good luck on the next exam, Mr Knightle.
Knightle:
I have abandoned such a title!
Luke:
Huh?
Knightle:
I live, eat and breathe potatoes now. Potatoes are...my life. The journey of a potato seller is a long and arduous one... You may now address me as...Spudley!

Some of this stuff looks like rubbish. Where did it come from?
After examining Mary and Knightle:
Luke:
It seems like the knights haven't been looking for us here.
Phoenix:
I guess not. I'd really like to stick around and see what other information we can find around here.
Luke:
But the only other people around here look a little...shady, if you ask me.
Phoenix:
All the more reason we should ask. I'm sure they've heard all sorts of rumblings out here. Espella must be a nervous wreck waiting for us to get back with some information. We can't go back empty-handed, right?
Luke:
You're right! Well then! Let's get back on the case! How about we try looking over there, Mr Wright?

Yeah...I-I think I'm okay...considering.
Luke:
Whew! That's a relief!
Phoenix:
What could've caused that explosion? And of all places... Why the middle of the marketplace?
Luke:
Mr Wright, do you think... Could a witch have done this? We know they can summon fire and turn people into gold... There's no doubt about it! This has to be the work of magic!
Phoenix:
I agree. At least, it sure seems likely.
Luke:
We should investigate the area of the blast. Let's go, Mr Wright! I'm sure we'll find something that'll give us a lead regarding the witches.
Phoenix:
Right. And if we come across anyone injured, let's give them a hand, all right?
Luke:
In that case, how about we split up? ...I'll go and check that side over there!
Examine
Mary
Mary:
Oh dear! Why do all the strangest things always happen on THIS side of town?!
Phoenix:
..."Always happen"? Ms Mary, did something else happen here?
Mary:
Isn't it obvious? This area was perfectly peaceful before you started trying to defend every witch out there! You do remember the incident with Robbs and Muggs, don't you?
Phoenix:
Oh yeah.... That happened right around here, didn't it?
Mary:
Yes. Right on the footpath that leads to the courthouse through the forest. ............ You know...I've just remembered something rather strange.
Phoenix:
...What's that?
Mary:
Just before the blast, I saw a bright spark on the ground.
Phoenix:
A bright spark?
Mary:
Truth be told, I noticed the same thing back when those flames erupted, too.
Phoenix:
So you saw...a spark of light on the ground?
Mary:
Yes, yes! I definitely saw it. I definitely saw a spark on the ground.
Phoenix:
A-and you say this was before the explosion? Could it have something to do with magic?
Mary:
I'm afraid I couldn't say. Snowy and I will be staying far, far, FAR away from this mess! We're not getting dragged into any trials! N-now I have to get back to the farm! I have to go and protect my precious little lovelies!
Phoenix:
Oh boy... I see the crazy goat lady is still as crazy as ever...
Mary (subsequent times)
Mary:
I'd think about getting out of here if I were you! Snowy and I aren't getting wrapped up in any more of that courtroom drama!

"What's this?"
Luke Triton
Luke:
...Hmm, I see. There's nothing left anywhere around the area of the blast. Huh? Is something wrong, Mr Wright? Don't worry about this side. The ace apprentice has it all under control!
Knightle
Knightle:
Why?! Why?! Whhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyy?! Why must the fates conspire against me?! ...I failed to become a knight! ...And now, just look at my potatoes! They're all baked! Every last one of them! Who would ever buy a baked potato?!
Phoenix:
Wh-whoa, whoa whoa! Calm down, Knigh- err, Spudley!
Knightle:
Knightle is dead... Spudley is no more... Oh, cruel fate! Oh, Storyteller! Please... Tell me what... WHAT-OH-WHAT should I do now?!
Phoenix:
Hey now, c'mon, Spudley. Your potatoes are just a little baked. They're still good!
Luke:
Here's an idea! Why don't you just give yourself a temporary name until you decide what you should do!
Knightle:
Why, that's it! After all, WHAT is a man? ...Ah ha! Henceforth, I shall be known as the ever-pondering...Sir Whatley!
Phoenix:
...Identity crisis averted. Let's get going, Luke.
Luke:
Okay!
Knightle (subsequent times)
Knightle:
Behold! Whatley is born! I shall make it my life's mission to find out...my life's mission!
Phoenix:
What's this? It kinda looks like a bell? (I can't describe it, but something's weird about this bell...)
Small Bell added to Items.

Hey, Luke! Are you okay? I-it's you!

Luke:
Wait a second. Haven't we seen her somewhere before...?
Phoenix:
N-no way! I-I don't get it. There's no way you should be alive...
Luke:
...What? Oh! I remember where we saw her! It was at the other trial! You're... Weren't you?
Phoenix:
Ms Kira!
Kira:
............
Luke:
You're right. It IS Miss Kira...
Phoenix:
...Yeah. She was supposed to have been dropped into the flames. We saw it with our own eyes!
Kira:
............ I...I must go.
Phoenix:
Wait a minute, Ms Kira! I just wanna ask you a few questions!
Kira:
I must go...quickly. If I fail my task...I cannot return.
Luke:
T-task...?
Phoenix:
Tell us, Ms Kira! How is it...that you're still alive?
Kira:
...I must go.
Luke:
Wh-whoa! Did you see that? She...
Phoenix:
She just...vanished.
Luke:
Was that...the spell "Dimere"?
Phoenix:
I don't think so... Remember, to cast magic, you need to be carrying a Talea Magica... And we didn't hear her say any sort of incantation, so... (But I did see her ring that small bell...)
Luke:
That bell...what do you think it's for?
Phoenix:
............
Luke:
Um...Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
...Ms Kira should've died when she was dropped into the fire, but she looked alive to me just now. If that's the case, then maybe... ...Maya! ............ Hey, Luke!
Luke:
Y-yes?
Phoenix:
Let's head back to Rouge's place! I just thought of one more place we need to search!
Luke:
Eh? But why?
Phoenix:
There's no time to explain. We have to get back. Espella will want to hear this, too.
Luke:
Okay, got it!
Examine
Mary
Mary:
Ooooooh. There, there... Shhh... Shhh... It's okay, it's all over now.
Snowy:
Baaaa!
Phoenix:
Um...Ms Mary?
Mary:
What is it? Can't you see I'm a little busy right now? My precious Snowy is so stressed. Isn't that right, snowflake of my eye?
Snowy:
Baaaa!
Luke:
Hmm, Snowy says what's stressing him out most right now is the headlock you've got him in...
Phoenix:
(Talking to animals... That has to be a first for any assistant I've ever had...) Ms Mary, you didn't happen to see a girl run by here by any chance, did you?
Mary:
I don't think so. I don't think I've seen a single person come by, actually.
Luke:
Huh? You didn't see her at all? She was wearing a black robe! And what's more, that girl was actually Miss Kira!
Mary:
Hmm?! Did you say Kira? What are you blabbing about? Kira was sent to the flames, don't you remember?
Luke:
But it really was Kira! We saw her!
Mary:
S-stop pulling my leg! Snowy and I want nothing to do with this! We won't hear another word about all these "witches" and "magic"! We saw nothing, you hear me? Nothing! Now just leave me and Snowy in peace!
Mary (subsequent times)
Mary:
That explosion's really put a damper on things around here, hasn't it? But I'm thankful my little snowball made it out safe and sound.
Tavern
Espella:
Oh...Mr Wright, Luke! I heard a loud bang coming from the town... Did something happen there?
Luke:
There was a HUGE explosion! Thankfully no one was hurt...
Espella:
An explosion?!
Phoenix:
We don't know for certain...but I suspect magic was involved.
Espella:
M-magic, you say...?
Luke:
Oh yeah! Th-that reminds me! You're not going to believe who we just ran into! ...Miss Kira!
Espella:
K-Kira...? B-but that can't be right! I mean, she...
Phoenix:
Wait a minute, guys. Can I just say something?
Espella:
Yes, what is it?
Phoenix:
I still can't believe it myself, but...Luke and I definitely saw Kira in town today.
Espella:
Th-that...
Luke:
Um...couldn't she have...been brought back with magic somehow?
Phoenix:
...I don't think so. Remember, Inquisitor Barnham said that no such magic exists.
Luke:
Oh yeah...that's right.
Phoenix:
Regardless, the reality is Kira should have been burned after the trial but is somehow now alive again... That means, as crazy as it sounds... there's still hope!
Luke:
...! Y-you mean... There's a chance Maya is still alive!
Espella:
What...?
Phoenix:
That's right.
Espella:
Maya is still alive... A-are you absolutely certain, Mr Wright?!
Phoenix:
I think so. I mean, if magic isn't the reason for Kira's sudden reappearance... then there's only one place we really need to investigate.
Luke:
I think I know! The fire cage back at the courtroom, right?
Phoenix:
...Exactly. I have a hunch there's more to that cage than meets the eye. I bet if we search that place inside and out, we're bound to uncover some kind of huge secret!
Espella:
We should hurry then!
Phoenix:
Yeah. There's just...one small problem. We've got the entire knighthood looking for us... How can we sneak back in there without getting caught?
Luke:
Ah ha...! I've got it! Don't worry, Mr Wright! Just leave it to me! Eve told me about a hidden entrance behind the courtroom. It's the same secret entrance I used to help Espella escape from the courtroom!
Espella:
Huh...? E-Eve told you?
Luke:
Uh... Ha ha... A-anyway... We should get going, right?!
Examine
Rouge
Leads to:
"What's with all the commotion?"
Rouge:
What's with all the commotion? Did I hear someone say there was an explosion in town?
Luke:
That's right, Miss Rouge. No one was hurt, but a few stalls were destroyed...
Rouge:
Huh. Is that so...?
Espella:
Um...Ms Rouge? What do you think will happen to the street stall owners now that their stalls are gone? They probably won't be able to open their stalls for a while...
Rouge:
I say we oughta look on the bright side. At least no one was hurt, right? With the townsfolk and my little group of good-fer-nothings here helping out, everything will be rebuilt in no time. A little hard work wouldn't hurt the lazy bums, trust me. Don't you worry about the townsfolk. Just leave them to me. You have your own things to be thinking about. Well? Are you headed out, or what?
Espella:
Y-yes, if that's all right. I'm terribly sorry for leaving in the middle of helping you, Ms Rouge...
Rouge:
It's fine. Don't you worry your pretty little head over it, Espella.
Espella:
Thank you so much, Miss Rouge... for everything.
Rouge:
...All right, all right. Don't get all mushy on me. Just get out there and get it done.
Examine
Rouge
Rouge:
Leave the townsfolk to me. Go on, get going.

That was an explosion! What's going on?
Espella:
What was Kira doing here?
Luke:
Quick, we need to investigate this incident!
Area above roof windows of center-right house
Phoenix:
Thankfully, no one was hurt in the explosion.
Espella:
If you want to go to the courthouse, better hurry up before the knights come!
Luke:
Was that explosion...caused by Miss Kira with magic?
Vendor on right
Espella:
The explosion has prompted shopkeepers to close their shops early today and go home.
Luke:
Everyone's nervously looking around.
Phoenix:
It'll be a while before it's business as usual here.
Road to the Court
Examine
Tree foliage on far left
Luke:
Mr Wright, I understand you want some time to enjoy the scenery, but we really need to go!

Espella:
Let's hurry, before the knights take notice of the commotion and find us!
Arrows on signpost
Phoenix:
The Witches' Court lies further ahead. I hope we don't run into anyone on the way there.
Court Entrance
Phoenix:
Well, it looks like the knights haven't tried searching for us out here, huh? So where do we go now?
Luke:
We take the hidden passage into the courtroom, of course! Espella, you remember it, right?
Espella:
You mean...the passage we used to escape yesterday?
Luke:
That's right!
Espella:
...Luke, how is it you know about this secret passage, anyway? I had no idea such a thing could exist here in the courtroom.
Luke:
Well, it was hidden within a puzzle. Answering it correctly unlocks the door. But I closed the door, just to be on the safe side. All I have to do is solve the puzzle again to open the way!
Phoenix:
All right. It's in your capable hands then, Luke!
Luke:
Right! The entrance is right over there!

We're almost there, Mr Wright!
Phoenix:
Are you all right, Espella? Not long now!
Espella:
Uh-huh...yes, I'm fine.

Deathknell Dungeon
Phoenix:
Woah!
Luke:
Waaah!
Espella:
Ahhh!
Phoenix:
Ouch...that smarts. ...A secret entrance in the ceiling, huh... What are the odds?
Espella:
It doesn't look like we can go out the way we came in, does it?
Phoenix:
...Let's not focus on how we'll go back for the time being.
Espella:
Yes, you're right. But where did we end up, exactly? ...It looks like one of the cells underneath the courtroom.
Luke:
H-huh? Uh-oh! I'm so sorry... I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere. But we should get to the courtroom if we continue straight from here...
???:
Wh-what are you...?
Phoenix:
M-Ms Greyerl?!
Espella:
Miss Greyerl... You're okay!
Greyerl:
M-Miss Cantabella! Are you unharmed?
Phoenix:
Thank goodness... We were all so worried about you. So it looks like...they didn't feed you to the flames after all.
Greyerl:
...It's all due to your brilliant defence work.
Phoenix:
Well, I...
Greyerl:
To argue that, even if I was a witch, I still did not commit the crime... Your words...seemed to have a profound effect on the judge and somehow changed his mind. I'm...currently awaiting my new sentence instead of being sent to the flames. I am truly, truly...thankful to you.
Phoenix:
I-it was nothing... I'm just glad I was able to help you.
Greyerl:
And yet... I must also apologise to you.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Greyerl:
For what happened to Miss Fey... It was truly tragic... and I was the cause of it all... Simply thinking back on it is difficult.
Luke:
Miss Greyerl! There's something you really should know!
Greyerl:
What...? What do you mean?
Luke:
Earlier today, in town... we saw someone who we thought had been sent to the flames! We saw Miss Kira!
Greyerl:
Wh-what did you just say?! B-but...if I remember correctly, there is no magic that can bring the dead back to life!
Luke:
Yup. That's right. And I imagine... There isn't anything in alchemy that can do that either, is there?
Greyerl:
............ Master Belduke always used to say: "Alchemy is logical. Its very existence is tied to the natural order of the world." To break that rule is to try and swim against the tide of Mother Nature herself. ...Therefore, the dead cannot be returned to the world of the living. That is the natural order of the world.
Luke:
I-I...see.
Greyerl:
There's...one more thing. Bringing the dead back to life violates all logic... Yet, if what you say is true and you did in fact see Miss Kira today... then I imagine you believe there has to be some manner of trickery present that can supposedly "bring back" the dead.
Phoenix:
...!
Greyerl:
That means the reason you have all put yourselves in great danger coming here... is so you can find out the true nature of this "trickery", specifically the fire cage.
Luke:
Th-that's incredible, Miss Greyerl! That's exactly why we're here! We're going to inspect that fire cage inside and out to see if there's anything strange about it!
Greyerl:
The Chamber of Fire is located just past the waiting area... however, there may be guards stationed there at the moment. Getting past them undetected is going to be rather difficult.
Luke:
Th-that would be my fault! I accidentally led us down the wrong path...
Phoenix:
Taking that wrong path is how we ended up meeting Ms Greyerl, Luke.
Luke:
Huh...?
Espella:
He's right, Luke. We were able to meet her thanks to you!
Greyerl:
I agree. I'm glad we all managed to meet again.
Luke:
R-really? Ah, ha ha...
Phoenix:
Well, anyway... We've got to think about how we can get past those guards.
Greyerl:
............ If it pleases you, I ask that you leave those guards to me, Mr Wright.
Luke:
Huh...?
Greyerl:
I'll draw their attention. Then, while they're distracted, you sneak past them into the Chamber of Fire.
Phoenix:
B-but, Ms Greyerl...we wouldn't want to get you into any more trouble...
Greyerl:
Not at all. Nothing I can do will ever repay you for what you've done for me. ...Please allow me the honour of assisting you this once.
Phoenix:
............ All right. We won't forget this, Ms Greyerl!
Greyerl:
AHHHHHHHHH! Guards! Guards! Please! It's most urgent!
Knight:
Wh-what? What's going on in there?!
Knight:
It's coming from the Deathknell Dungeon! Hurry!
Waiting Hall
Phoenix:
It looks like she did it! They're gone.
Espella:
It would seem all of the guards bolted off in the direction of the cells when they heard her voice.
Luke:
Let's head inside before they come back!
Phoenix:
Right. C'mon, let's go!

Phoenix:
Don't worry, Luke. It's different this time. Last time there was nothing but despair... but this time there's a glimmer of hope.
Luke:
Right you are!
Espella:
Let's try and find some clues now that there isn't anyone inside this contraption.
Luke:
Espella's right! Let's finally get to the bottom of this!
Phoenix:
...Yeah, let's get started. How about we start by checking out the area around the contraption?

Phoenix:
Not really much of a railing here... One good trip and it's a one-way trip down... *gulp*
Espella:
Maybe there's something hidden at the bottom?
Luke:
Wow... Even without the fire, this pit still looks quite terrifying, doesn't it, Mr Wright?
Cage
Espella:
The cage has been hoisted up into the air. I still remember how terrifying it was to be trapped in there...
Luke:
Hmm... I wonder if there's some sort of trick we don't know about inside that cage?
Phoenix:
I'm not too sure, Luke. It's hard to tell looking at it from down here.
Dark archway behind lever
Luke:
Mr Wright, look! It's dark, but you can just make out where the audience sits during the trials.
Espella:
Just yesterday this was bursting with people...
Phoenix:
It's really eerie when it's all dark and quiet like this. ...We should hurry.
Phoenix:
I remember seeing a knight pull this lever here last time.
Espella:
Maybe we should give it a pull. That way we'll be able to see from here if anything changes or moves.
Luke:
Good idea, Espella! Let's give it a shot!
Luke:
H-hnnnnnnnggggggh! I-it won't budge!
Phoenix:
Luke, do you need me to give it a shot?
Luke:
Hhhnnnnnngggggh... It's not that...hnnngh! It just keeps... getting stuck...hnnngh! Halfway... Hhhnnnnnngggggh...
Phoenix:
It stops...halfway?
Espella:
U-um, perhaps... Maybe it doesn't move unless someone is inside the cage...?
Phoenix:
Hmm... That's a possibility.
Luke:
......
Phoenix:
(But...who in their right mind would be crazy enough to go inside?)
Espella:
I'll go inside, Mr Wright!
Phoenix:
Espella, no way am I letting you get inside that thing. We've been trying to keep you OUT of the fire, remember? I'll do it. Granted, I'm not a big fan of heights, but... there has to be some sort of trick to this whole thing... I don't think there's anything to worry about.
Luke:
...Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Hm? What's up, Luke?
Luke:
I-I'll get inside! Please, let me go inside and try it out!
Phoenix:
L-Luke...
Espella:
Luke!
Luke:
it's just like Mr Wright said. There's a hidden trick behind this device. I think so too, and I believe in Mr Wright!
Phoenix:
Yeah, but...you really shouldn't be putting yourself in harm's way!
Luke:
It's no problem for ace apprentice and gentleman in training Luke Triton! There's more to this fire pit than meets the eye, and it's up to us to get to the bottom of it! The parade is going to start before we know it! Let's hurry, Mr Wright!
Phoenix:
...Okay, fine. But promise me you'll get out of there at the first sign of danger, all right?
Luke:
I promise!
Phoenix:
All right, Luke, are you ready?
Luke:
Ready whenever you are!
Espella:
...Luke, be careful...
Luke:
Don't worry, Espella! Remember what Miss Greyerl said earlier. It's impossible to bring people back from the dead. So that means this whole thing must be fake!
Espella:
Yes. Yes, you're right!
Phoenix:
Okay, here we go... ............
Luke:
Whenever you're ready, Mr Wright! Don't hesitate, just pull it!
Phoenix:
No, no... It's not that. It's this lever... It looks like it's actually a puzzle, if you can believe that...

Nope! I'm right as rain! Um...thank you for saving me back there. You look like you're all back to normal, Professor! Not as shiny and way more talkative.

...What do you mean by "back to normal"?
Maya:
You were turned into gold, Professor. Someone cast a magic spell on you!
Layton:
A-a magic spell...on me, you say?
Maya:
Let me refresh your memory. You remember the witch that appeared when we were in Mr Belduke's house, don't you?
Layton:
Indeed. So you're saying that was when... a magic spell was cast on me?
Maya:
That's right! You were SUPER golden and SUPER shiny!
Layton:
"Super" shiny and golden... Most fascinating.
Maya:
Do you...not remember any of that?
Layton:
Sadly, I do not... ...To tell you the truth, I have no recollection of what happened to me then. It seems I lost consciousness immediately after the witch appeared... and when I regained consciousness, I was already in this forest.
Maya:
Huh... So, then...do you think maybe they carried you here after the trial?
Layton:
...A-after the trial? Then that must mean...
Maya:
Yup. You were the unfortunate victim of witchcraft in that trial, Professor.
Layton:
H-how extraordinary... Miss Fey, could you please bring me up to date on everything that happened after my disappearance? What about Luke and Mr Wright? Are they okay? I recall Luke and I heading to Sir Belduke's house. We thought you and Mr Wright were in danger.
Maya:
Y-yeah... I think they're all right. So much has happened... Where do I even start?
Layton:
...Did I hear you correctly? You say that one of my arms broke off?
Maya:
Yup! The right arm! Snap-o!
Layton:
And so, Miss Fey, you were charged with using magic...?
Maya:
Yup! That's right! And then, Luke cried his little eyes out! And THEN, the parrot on Luke's head testified its little beak off!
Layton:
That must have been quite the sight. ...But I must say, this situation has certainly piqued my interest. Hmm, I see... My apologies, Miss Fey. Had I had the strength at the time, I could have been of more help.

No way, Professor! You saved me just a moment ago!
Layton:
And quite the close call it was. By the way, Miss Fey, why are you in this forest?
Maya:
That...is a very good question. Nick managed to prove my innocence, but... I still ended up being thrown into the fire.
Layton:
You were found innocent, yet still sent to the fire?
Maya:
Well, anyways! So much weird stuff has happened since then!
Layton:
...It would seem so, yes.
Maya:
...But it's strange. There must have been more to that cage I was trapped in. Like, a trick or something...
Layton:
A trick...?
Maya:
Yeah. The cage dropped down through the chamber and then came to a stop just above a wagon... That wagon was how I ended up here.
Layton:
It would seem there is more that fire chamber than I originally thought...
Maya:
Then when I saw those...things, I tried to get away. But as you saw back there, they found me. I thought I was a goner...
Layton:
And that is when I appeared, is that correct?
Maya:
Yup! That's right! ............
Layton:
Is something the matter, Miss Fey?
Maya:
It's Nick... He must be worried sick. I mean, I was thrown into the fire right before his eyes.
Layton:
...Yes. I'm also concerned about Luke. However, I believe Luke and Mr Wright... are certain to sense something is amiss and solve this mystery. We're sure to all meet up again soon.
Maya:
Y-yeah! You're right, Professor!
Layton:
For the time being, let's investigate this place as much as possible.
Maya:
Investigate...?
Layton:
Indeed. This forest appears to be full of secrets... First, I was turned into gold and awoke to find myself here... And then you, Miss Fey, were transported here from the courtroom, under the illusion of having been put to the fire. Perhaps this forest...
Maya:
......Uh-oh! How'd they manage to find us so fast?! What should we do, Professor?!
Layton:
Hmm... It appears they were lying in ambush. I'm afraid an altercation here is unavoidable.
Maya:
Th-these guys look like they've been hitting the gym. They're a lot bigger than the others...
Layton:
Indeed. Leave this to me. Now...please step back, Miss Fey.
Maya:
Knock 'em into next week, Professor!
???:
...Now, just what is all the commotion? You were given a task to carry out, were you not...? So what exactly do you think you're doing? Answer me.
Shade:
Forgive us... Oh Great Witch...
Maya:
Wh-WHAAAAAAT?! Th-that's the witch from last time! What's she doing here?!
Layton:
...!
???:
...Now, isn't this a strange sight? Two visitors from the witch trials... A victim and an accused? Strange, indeed...
Maya:
C-come again...? It was YOUR fault we were a part of those trials in the first place, you...you witch!
???:
My, this one has some fight in her. Relax. I do not plan to harm you two.
Layton:
...... This marks the third time we have now met. Tell me...what exactly are you planning?
Maya:
What?! Professor... You two have met three times?
Layton:
Yes. I first met her in London. Prior to arriving in Labyrinthia, of course.
???:
Heh heh... That's right. Now, enough. Stand down. These two are considered guests. You are not to lay a finger on them, is that clear? Make sure the rest of the Shades get that message.
Maya:
Shades? Are they those creepy people in the weird robes?
Shade:
Yes, mistress. As you command, oh Great Witch...
Layton:
"Great Witch"...?
The Great Witch:
There is no need to be alarmed. You may relax.
Layton:
I'm afraid I cannot oblige. Not as long as you are here. Tell me. What are you?
The Great Witch:
...You know, from what I hear, you're a big fan of solving puzzles and mysteries, are you not?
Layton:
...!
The Great Witch:
Then, by all means, go ahead. You are free to investigate the Eldwitch Woods to your heart's content.
Layton:
The Eldwitch Woods...
The Great Witch:
The answers to your questions are here. ...You're free to seek them.
Layton:
...Then you do not plan on having us captured?
The Great Witch:
You'll have to excuse the Shades' earlier behaviour. They can be a bit...overzealous at times. They were simply doing what was requested of them. Their "task", as they call it. Anyone lost in these woods is to be made a member of the Shade "family", as it were.
Maya:
A-a member of the Shades? What does that mean?
The Great Witch:
Like I said, you should seek out the answers for yourselves. ...Now, if you'll excuse me. I have another engagement with a visitor of mine.
Layton:
...A visitor?
The Great Witch:
Until next time...Professor Hershel Layton.
Maya:
Sh-she disappeared...
Layton:
......
Maya:
Um... So, Professor... The "Great Witch" they mentioned... They must be referring to her, right? She has to be Bezella.
Layton:
The Great Witch Bezella... If that woman were here... then that would make Eldwitch Woods the home of all witches.
Maya:
Hmm...this just keeps getting curiouser and curiouser! So then that means the "Shades", or whatever, are...witches?
Layton:
That is what we must find out. I believe there may be a very important clue or two hidden within this forest. There must be some reason why this forest has been kept a secret from the citizens of Labyrinthia. I also must wonder why this "Great Witch" is simply allowing us to do as we wish... It is slightly concerning.
Maya:
Well, there's no point looking a gift horse in the mouth! I say we take her offer and check this place out! That way we'll rack up a TON of clues by the time we reunite with Nick. And since we'll be working together, I'll act as your temporary Luke! "Right you are, Professor!"
Layton:
Ha ha... Well done. Thank you very much, Miss Fey. Now then, let us begin our investigation.
Maya:
Yessir! Let's go, Professor!
A new destination has been added to the map: Shades' Village East.
MYSTERY SOLVED
The Storyteller
Espella's father - the Storyteller, who writes the Story that controls the fate of all Labyrinthians - considers the presence of the professor to be a form of corruption.
It would seem that the Storyteller has removed me from the Story. Where is this tale of his going?
MYSTERY SOLVED
Golden Layton
It was none other than the professor, having supposedly been turned to gold, who saved Maya from her fate. He says he had lost consciousness after his confrontation with the Great Witch.
A gold statue of me? That's something I would quite like to see with my own eyes.

Shade
Shade:
......
Maya:
Um, excuse me. We wanted to ask you a question real quick... What exactly do you do in this forest?
Shade:
We live to serve the mistress and carry out her orders...our tasks... The mistress speaks...we obey...
Maya:
"Tasks"? Is that, like, your job?
Shade:
Yes... My task...is to assist all newly initiated Shades...
Maya:
Assist...newly initiated Shades?
Layton:
That must have something to do with what the Great Witch said earlier: Anyone lost in these woods is to be made a member of the Shade "family"...
Shade:
Although...my task is made much more difficult when they run away... Why do they always run away...? But we will not chase after you again. It is the mistress' orders...
Layton:
I see. So you do everything the Great Witch commands?
Maya:
Hey, I bet you guys are always fighting over the good "tasks", huh? Who'd want to get stuck doing the Great Witch's laundry? Seriously, though... You guys were really close to turning me into a Shade earlier.
Shade:
............
Maya:
I'm SERIOUSLY glad the professor came along when he did!
Shade (subsequent times)
Shade:
My task...is to assist all newly initiated Shades... I must continue with my task...
Vines on wall to right of tree roots
Maya:
Y'know, Professor, I was thinking. You said you woke up in the forest, right? The Shades were on me the minute I set foot here... but they never went after you. Why is that?
Layton:
That is true... I seem to recall waking up inside a cell, of sorts.
Maya:
D-did you just say a cell?! How did you manage to escape?
Layton:
Fortunately, it was not a cell of the metallic variety, Miss Fey. Take a look over there... Do you see that entrance covered in vines?
Maya:
Oooh I get it... So you must have hack 'n' slashed your way to freedom.
Layton:
Well, I wouldn't say I "hacked" or "slashed" anything, as such. All it took was a single cut to unravel my way to freedom. Allow me to demonstrate.

Maya:
Whoooooa! You sure showed that vine who's boss, Professor!
Layton:
A single, precise cut is far more efficient than swinging around haphazardly. After I freed myself, I began to investigate the forest. Not long after that, I heard someone cry out.
Maya:
Ah...yeah. You mean me?
Layton:
Right you are, Miss Fey. I'm glad you were okay.
Maya:
Uh-huh. And "okay" I was, good sir. So I guess you're still in the middle of that forest investigation, huh?
Layton:
It would seem so. Shall we press on then?
Maya:
Yeah! It's on now! I'm gonna cut these puzzles down to size with the power of my mind!
Middle alcove (after solving hidden puzzle)
Maya:
You know, now that you cut the vines off here... This doesn't look like much of a "cell". More like a storage closet or something...
Layton:
Hmm...there do seem to be a variety of vases and ornaments littered inside. I wonder what they're all used for...
Maya:
Hey! Check out the one that looks like a cat! I bet Espella and Luke would LOVE this! Let's take it back for them. It'll be like their own little piece of the Eldwitch Woods, since they weren't able to come.
Layton:
Hmm... I have a sneaking suspicion the Shades would likely chase after us if we did...
Large top branch of tree
Maya:
Check out the branches on that tree. It kinda reminds me of a stadium dome! ...Minus the stadium.
Layton:
Indeed. And it would appear this arrangement of branches is natural. Simply remarkable.
Middle of tree trunk
Layton:
In reality, this tree is really two trees grown together. Its twisted structure is simply fascinating.
Maya:
That's the trunk... No, no wait! That's a branch...? Hmm...a root?! This tree's a jerk, let's go!
Pots in alcove second to the right
Layton:
Could these pots have been used in some sort of ceremony? There's no mistake, these are certainly very old.
Maya:
I bet you're just dying to check out these relics, huh, Professor?
Shades' Village East
Maya:
Do you think...this is where the Shades live? It looks kinda like a village.
Layton:
It would appear so. They seem to lead a very simple lifestyle.
Maya:
But they look so magical and fantastical. I figured they'd live somewhere way more... well, magical and fantastical.
Layton:
............ Now that you mention it, they don't appear capable of using magic, do they?
Maya:
I guess if they did they'd only end up back at the witch trials.
Layton:
Remember...that may be the law within Labyrinthia... but the Great Witch rules this forest. It is doubtful that such a law would exist here.
Maya:
Oh...that's true. You think we should tell them to just let loose? I bet they have some really flashy spells.
Layton:
Let us focus our efforts on looking around this village first. There appears to be a path leading out on the other side, too...
A new destination has been added to the map: Shades' Village West.

Shade to left of path
Shade:
All I can do is carry out my tasks the best I can...in hope that one day I may be allowed to return to the town.
Layton:
Return? What do you mean?
Shade:
I am not too sure myself... It is something I was told when I arrived. The Great Witch keeps a record of all the tasks we successfully complete. Then...when our accomplishments outnumber our failures... She will consider returning us to the town. That is what I believe, and that is why I continue to toil away at my tasks.
Maya:
...Hm? So, does this mean these guys aren't witches?
Layton:
From the sound of his voice, it would seem this particular Shade is male. However, according to what you told me earlier...all witches here are female.
Maya:
Hmmm... So then, who exactly are these Shades? Say, um...who are you?
Layton:
...My, how very direct.
Shade:
A Shade is a Shade. Nothing more, nothing less.
Maya:
...Yeah, that wasn't really helpful.
Layton:
Perhaps you can tell us what your particular task is?
Shade:
............ That I cannot tell you. Most Shades' tasks are closely guarded secrets.
Shade to left of path (subsequent times)
Shade:
All I can do is carry out my tasks in hope that I may one day return to town. The details of our tasks...are strictly secret.
Shade to right of path
Shade:
So, how's the task going? Working hard?
Maya:
Huh? Oh...t-task? Well, duh! Of course we are! Speaking of which, what's your task?
Shade:
My task is to prepare food for everyone. I'm actually trying to come up with the menu for today... I wouldn't exactly call my cooking "appetising" or "edible", but I must do what our mistress commands...
Maya:
Hmm...remind us NOT to stop by for dinner.
Shade:
...Did you say something?
Maya:
Me? Nope! Not a thing! Hey, good luck! Try not to blow up the kitchen!
Shade to right of path (subsequent times)
Shade:
What should I put on today's menu...?
Maya:
It looks like he's still struggling with what to put on the menu.
Hut on left
Layton:
Compared to the houses found in Labyrinthia, the Shades' dwellings appear much more primitive.
Maya:
Primitive? It doesn't look like they have indoor plumbing, Professor. That's WORSE than primitive!
Well
Maya:
Professor, I'm happy to report that the Shades have mastered well-making technology!
Layton:
Indeed. This well reminds me of the features of Labyrinthia. Perhaps they share the same source.
Hut on tree
Layton:
They've built a house up on a tree. How inventive. They must use a series of ladders to reach the top.
Maya:
I knew you were smart, Professor! You do NOT want to hear Nick's thoughts on ladders, trust me.

Layton:
This small path looks as if it leads away from the Shades' village.
Maya:
Yup. It's a path. For walking.
Raised levels of shrine
Layton:
Fascinating. I would like nothing more than to examine that shrine, but I'm afraid we must hurry on.
Maya:
Wonder who built that thing? Y'think it was the Shades' great-great-great-great-GREAT-grandparents?
Trunk of tree in front of path
Maya:
I wonder if Wordsmith is still in the market for a new napping spot...? This tree is totally napping material!
Layton:
Under better circumstances, this tree would be most ideal for enjoying a nice cup of tea under its shade.
Shade:
I'm terrible at my task. The. Worst. I'm even more terrible at following orders... One small misstep and it'll be my fault we have a serious situation on our hands. I feel sick just thinking about it...
Layton:
A "serious situation"...? What kind of task do you have, exactly?
Shade:
I can't say... The only thing I can say is that I'm terrible at it.
Maya:
Umm...why are you so nervous, anyway?
Shade:
It's because she's watching...always watching... She sits up there in her mansion and just keeps on watching...
Layton:
Mansion? You mean, the Great Witch lives nearby?
Shade:
On the other side of the river... It's quite far, but she can see our every move.
Layton:
So it's across the river, then?
Maya:
Professor...we're sure to run into her again there. It's where she lives, after all.
Layton:
The best course of action may be to try and make our way there. There are still many questions to be answered.
Maya:
Yeah! Then we'll finally see if she's the real deal or not, right, Professor?
Layton:
That's right, Miss Fey. Let us make our way across the river.
A new destination has been added to the map: Red Flower Lake.
Examine
Shade
Shade:
I'm terrible at my task. The. Worst. I'm even more terrible at following orders... But you know who's REALLY the worst? The Great Witch, for making me go through so much stress, that's who...
Red Flower Lake
Maya:
Whooooooa. Check out the beautiful scenery, Professor!
Layton:
This is quite an open space, isn't it? Looking across the river...the Great Witch's mansion is slightly visible.
Maya:
Yeah, you can just about make out the roof from here. Hey, do you think the wall behind it... could be Labyrinthia's outer wall?
Layton:
That is quite possible. Which would mean...these Eldwitch Woods must be located directly outside Labyrinthia.
Maya:
Huh? But isn't that kinda strange? The people in Labyrinthia said that nothing exists outside of the town, didn't they?
Layton:
...Yes, quite. I, too, have heard the townsfolk make such assertions. In fact, the very gate we used to enter Labyrinthia disappeared as soon as we passed it. ...I believe there must be some kind of a trick behind it.
Maya:
It looks like we've quite a lot to discuss with Little Miss Great Witch, don't we?
Layton:
That we do. Let us continue, Miss Fey.

Broken bridge
Layton:
Unfortunately, we cannot cross the bridge in its current state. Let us see what we can come up with.
Maya:
I know, Professor! How about we try talking to that Shade over there?
Red flower cluster to left of Shade
Maya:
Say, I think we're entitled to a few flowers, don't you think? We ARE the Great Witch's guests, after all!
Layton:
These flowers certainly have a most unique scent. ...Miss Fey, please refrain from picking the flowers.
Roof of mansion
Maya:
I-is that a mansion over there on the other side? Do you think that's the Great Witch's evil secret lair?!
Layton:
Hmm, could that be...? Let us find a way across and examine that side ourselves.
Middle/right sections of outer city wall
Layton:
That must be Labyrinthia... It would seem this forest is just outside of the town.
Maya:
Nick and the others must still be inside there somewhere, huh...?
Maya:
Oh no! The bridge is out!
Layton:
Hmm, it's been completely destroyed... All that remains are a few bits of debris and a small boat floating across the shore.
Shade:
Are you two looking for a way to cross the river?
Layton:
Yes, that's right. Is there no other way across?
Shade:
If there's a way across, I sure wish I knew what it was. I'm sort of having a mini crisis here. Why did I have to get stuck with the task of reporting the daily task progress to the Great Witch? Granted, I get to bask in the presence of the mistress and take in her gorgeous visage... Which is actually pretty amazing. But being unable to cross the river, I can't even carry out my task now...let alone adore her unparalleled beauty.
Maya:
Oh well. You know what they say: you either sink or swim... Hope you brought your bathing suits. We're swimming across!
Shade:
I...can't swim.
Layton:
...Hmm. We'll have to find another way.
Maya:
...Wait a sec. Professor, can you not swim? It's okay. I bet you could flip your hat over and ride it like a boat. It looks like it could float on water reeeeeeaaaal good!
Layton:
Swimming has nothing to do with it... And I do not think using my hat as a boat would be the best idea, Miss Fey. I'll go across and fetch that small boat. I should be able to jump across rather easily using the bits of debris on the water. I'll then be able to use the boat to create a path all the way across. Rest assured, Miss Fey...this is my speciality.
Maya:
Hey, that's not a bad idea! You don't miss a beat, do you, Professor? Good luck!

Yes! Now I can give my mistress today's report! Thank you so much. I don't know how to repay you.
Layton:
It was no trouble. A broken bridge would be inconvenient to everyone, after all.
Shade:
By the way, what kind of tasks did the Great Witch give you two? I'm itching to know.
Maya:
Huh? What's our task...? Umm... Let's see... Oh! That's it! We're puzzle solvers! Yup, that's right!
Shade:
Puzzle solvers... Ah, of course. That makes sense. Well, you have both performed your task magnificently. Please excuse me, I must report to the mistress. Now I can go back to truly enjoying my task! Farewell!
Maya:
Whoa, he's really booking it. Man, we did something really good, huh, Professor?!
Layton:
That we did, Miss Fey. Now, let us press on with our task.

Great Witch's Abode
Shade:
Oh, mistress! Mistress!
Layton:
Has something happened to the Great Witch?
Shade:
I went up to her room but...there was no answer. Oh, mistress... Most venerable Great Witch!
Maya:
Maybe she's just not in the mood to talk... Everyone has their days.
Shade:
No, never. She would never do that. The mistress always answers us.
Maya:
Wow. I've gotta say I'm surprised. It sounds like she's really faithful to you guys. ...Um. Maybe she just stepped out?
Shade:
If she stepped out, we would know! Oh, what could have happened to you, mistress...?
Layton:
That reminds me. She mentioned there was a visitor waiting for her, or words to that effect.
Maya:
Then that "visitor" must still be waiting around for her, right?
Shade:
No, no. They are both inside the room.
Maya:
...A-ha! I've got it! Zvarri! The supposed "visitor" is really some shady ex-knight looking for revenge!
Layton:
Miss Fey, please refrain from putting any terrible scenarios into his head. Regardless, we must continue inside. It seems something rather serious is afoot.

It's really hard to see around here... Who needs a security system when you've got fog, right, Professor?

Maya:
These are sure [sic] some pretty flowers. And they're everywhere! Quick! Put some under your hat, Professor!

Shade:
Mistress! Mistress! Please answer! Something...anything! If something were to happen to you, I... WAAAAAAAH!
Maya:
Wh-whoa... Everyone's really freaking out. Hey, maybe I should pretend to Bezella. I can be all, like: "SILENCE, MINIONS!"
Layton:
Indeed... I wonder what could have happened here.

Maybe she turned her visitor into a gold statue... Hopefully this one doesn't lose an arm.

Maya:
AHH! I-I'm sorry, I won't...
Layton:
There appear to be two pots, each with a different substance being cooked.
Maya:
Whoa... Check that out, Professor! The colour changed. ...How'd they do that?
Layton:
While I agree the change in colour is rather peculiar...I'm more interested in its smell. I have a strange feeling I've smelled this very same odour somewhere before.
Maya:
Yeah, now that you mention it...it does seem kinda familiar, doesn't it?
Shade on left platform (subsequent times)
Shade:
Quickly, quickly...very quickly... Mix, mix...must mix quickly...

Most important, huh? Are we talking like "Making soup for lunch" kind of important, or what?

Red flowers... YES! I'm restocked! Back to mixing! Back to stirring!
Layton:
This flower...blooms just off the shore of the lake, does it not? It would seem your task is to mix these red flowers into the pot, is that right?
Shade:
Red flower... Mix in... Stir... Red flower... Mix in... Stir...

Boy, he's seriously concentrating so hard he can't even afford to have a conversation. ............ Wonderful weather today, wouldn't you say?

You mean, mix the two liquids together?

Shades in center
Shade:
Oh, mistress, please answer... What could have happened?
Layton:
Excuse me, but...could you perhaps tell us what is going on here?
Shade:
We heard a loud noise from the mistress' room just a moment ago. We called out to her, but there was no answer. There was nothing. No answer at all. This isn't like her...
Maya:
A "loud noise", huh? Maybe that was the sound of the Great Witch being attacked.
Shade:
No! To harm one as beautiful as her... What BARBARIAN would do such a thing?! But if she was attacked... then that means the attacker is still... Eeeeeeek! Just thinking about it is making me shake in my robe!
Maya:
All right, guys! First things first! We've gotta get this door open!
Shade:
You are welcome to try, but we have already exhausted our options. You see, only the mistress has the key to this door. However, if something has happened, we had better hurry...
Shade:
H-how terrifying... I mean, please help us! B-but how utterly terrifying...

Shade:
Open the door... We must open the door... We must...help our mistress... We must...help the Great Witch...
Blue vat
Maya:
They really cranked up the heat on this pot. Look at that blue liquid bubble!
Layton:
Such a myriad of instruments. Creating these liquids must need the most precise measurements.
Red vat
Maya:
I wonder which liquid has the most bubbles when it boils? Red or blue?
Layton:
That is quite the sizeable pot. It must take quite a bit of time to bring that amount to a boil.
Bowls of red flowers on right
Layton:
Hmm... These appear to be the flowers that grow in the vicinity of the mansion.
Maya:
More flowers! I bet Espella would love these. Seriously, Professor, put some under your hat!

Layton:
Hmm, this Shade's task is proving to be quite challenging for her.
Maya:
Isn't her task... to mix the red and blue liquids together?
Shade:
Yes... They must be combined in equal measures. But no matter how many times I try, I cannot get it... Please... Can you help me...?
Maya:
H-huh? You want us to help...?
Layton:
...Hmm. I must admit, I am quite fascinated by the mixing process at work here. Very well. Let us give her a helping hand.

Shade:
You did it... You actually did it...
Maya:
I knew you could do it, Professor! Our Shade friend here looks pretty pleased.
Layton:
This liquid... It has a most mysterious glow. I wonder what type of dye they used? And yet, this scent... It smells oddly familiar... Perhaps I smelled it when arriving in this town... Hmm, no, I believe I smelled this scent before that, even...
Shade:
M-miiiiiistreeeeeeeeeess! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Maya:
Wh-what the...? What's wrong...?
Layton:
There's quite a bit of commotion coming from the entrance to that room... I believe something may have happened. Quickly, Miss Fey!
Maya:
R-right!
Examine
Shades in center
Leads to:
"Um...excuse me?"
Maya:
Um...excuse me?
Shade:
Waah!
Maya:
Ahh!
Shade:
Wh-what gives? Could you please not scare me like that...?
Layton:
Our apologies. There seems to be a great many of you gathered here. Has something happened inside?
Shade:
Something did happen... Oh! I can't even THINK about it, it's just so horrible!
Maya:
S-so what is this "horrible" thing that happened?
Shade:
The mistress...the Great Witch, she's... She's GONE!
Maya:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
Layton:
..."Gone"?
A new destination has been added to the map: Great Witch's Room.
Examine
Double doors in the distance
Leads to:
"Oh, mistress! I knew something was destined to happen! I felt a premonition most disturbing..."
Great Witch's Room
Shade:
Oh, mistress! I knew something was destined to happen! I felt a premonition most disturbing...
Shade:
How? How did this happen? I saw no one enter or leave this room!
Shade:
The entrance to the room was sealed shut... Where could she have gone...?
Shade:
......
Examine
Overturned chalice on left
You found a hint coin!
Fire bowl on left
You found a hint coin!
Upright pedestal on right
You found a hint coin!
Shade
Leads to:
"That's..."
Tear in curtain on left
Layton:
The curtain hanging from this wall appears to have suffered a single tear down the middle.
Maya:
Wait, Professor! Let me just check... All right, it's clear! No one's hiding behind the curtain.
Spilled liquid in center
Maya:
This place definitely screams "something serious just went down", doesn't it?
Layton:
It certainly seems so, Miss Fey. Unfortunately, the culprit seems to have disappeared...
Spilled liquid on curtain on right
Layton:
This red liquid managed to get sprayed throughout quite a bit of the room.
Maya:
From the looks of this place, the Great Witch definitely had her hands full...but what happened?
Layton:
That's...
Maya:
Wh-whoa...no kidding, Professor!
Layton:
It would seem the Shades made quite the mess searching for the Great Witch. Let us enquire with everyone in the room to get a better understanding of the situation at hand.
Maya:
Right! How about we start with that Shade over there?
Layton:
A good suggestion, Miss Fey.
Maya:
Um, excuse me? Do you think we could ask you a couple of questions?
Shade:
Sure...what is it? Hmph... It's not like I'm busy or anything.
Layton:
Could you perhaps describe to us what you saw when you entered the room?
Shade:
Yes... We all heard what sounded like a fight happening on the other side of the door. No matter how many times we called out to the mistress, there was no reply... We thought something might have happened to the mistress, so we forced the door open. But when we got inside, she was nowhere to be found...
Maya:
You say she was "nowhere to be found"... And was the door closed the whole time?
Shade:
Yes... It was most certainly closed. But somehow, the mistress managed to disappear...
Maya:
So let me get this straight: she disappeared from a sealed room, and then the room was found in a big mess... Professor! You know what this means? This means magic must be behind it!
Layton:
This is quite the peculiar situation. The Great Witch mentioned having to meet with a visitor. Do you happen to know if that person was in this room?
Shade:
A visitor... I faintly remember a visitor. I do remember hearing another voice... To be honest... I-I didn't actually see them...
Layton:
And there are no other exits present in this room, is that correct?
Shade:
Correct... This main door is the only one.
Maya:
Okay, so... The Great Witch and her "visitor" both disappeared from the room. And even with all of these Shades around, no one saw a single person enter or leave the room...
Layton:
Or perhaps, Miss Fey... this "visitor" simply managed to stay incognito during the ensuing commotion... That is one possibility.
Maya:
Huh? What do you mean, Professor?
Layton:
No one had seen the visitor prior to the incident, so even if that person was seen in this room... clearly no one would have realised it was them.
Maya:
But...wouldn't an outsider stick out like a sore thumb here? All of the Shades are dressed the same.
Layton:
Indeed, any "outsider" would certainly stand out. I imagine the Shades would be quick to apprehend them. However, what if this person were to disguise themselves as a Shade?
Maya:
Oh...oh! You could be right! Maybe they disguised themselves as a Shade right before the others came into the room...
Layton:
Precisely. The rather dishevelled appearance of this room would immediately draw one's attention. Thus providing the perfect distraction for the culprit to hide.
Maya:
Okay, okay, so... Where's this visitor now?
Layton:
No one has left this room since we entered. Therefore...he or she must still be in this very room.
Maya:
All right then...let's hurry up and catch 'em!
Layton:
In order to do that, we must question everyone currently present in the room and gather some information.
Shade:
U-umm...what do you mean...?
Layton:
My apologies for troubling you once again. Could you please gather together everyone who entered the room?
Shade:
Y-yes... Right away...!

Layton:
It would appear you are not quite the same as the other Shades present in this room.
Shade:
Hmph...
Layton:
The one who was in this room with the Great Witch... was you, was it not?
Shade:
............ Hmph. Impressive work, Sir Top Hat.
Maya:
Whaaaaaaaat?! Wh-what are YOU doing here...?!
Layton:
The Great Witch's visitor was in fact you... ...Inquisitor Barnham.
Barnham:
I have to say...that "logic" of yours is still as keen as ever, Sir Top Hat.
Layton:
Logic, coupled with careful, precise thinking, can topple any mystery. So tell us...what exactly are you doing here in this place?
Barnham:
I might ask the same of the two of you. How can it be... that both of you are still alive? You were turned into a gold statue... and was she not sent to the flames as a witch?!
Maya:
Hey... I. Am. Not. A. Witch!
Barnham:
This must be the Great Witch's handiwork as well!
Maya:
What?! No way... Inquisitor Barnham?! You didn't... Did you KILL the Great Witch...?!
Barnham:
...What on earth are you talking about? I remember doing no such thing.
Shade:
You...you wretched liar! What have you done with the mistress?!
Barnham:
Spare me. The condition of this unkempt room is but the result of its equally unkempt master.
Shade:
Insolence! None shall speak ill of the mistress!
Layton:
Please, stay calm. Inquisitor Barnham, please, tell us the state in which you found this room. Tell us, what happened here?
Barnham:
............ Hmph. It would seem the presence of an inquisitor has fouled the atmosphere with the stench of distrust. Very well. I will tell you what I know.
Barnham:
...I did not think the situation would devolve to such a state. I only came seeking the one that could cast some light on the doubts that plague my mind...
Maya:
And just who is this mysterious "one"?
Barnham:
............
Layton:
...You cannot say. Very well. Please continue, Inquisitor.
Barnham:
I followed them and was led here to this strange forest. That is why I was here... I was aiming to put a stop to whatever plan the Great Witch was attempting to concoct.
Layton:
So you disguised yourself in their robes and made your way here to this room in hopes of foiling her plans...
Barnham:
All those who doubt the Storyteller and speak ill of his word are a threat to all of Labyrinthia and its citizens. Of course, the witch refused to speak with me...and as I reached for my sword... I lost consciousness. Perhaps it was one of her detestable magic spells.
Shade:
Magic?! Lies! Your words are nothing but lies!
Barnham:
I am true to my word! That was what happened before you forced open the door! That is why I lost sight of the Great Witch and was left stranded in this room. I attempted to make my escape a quick one, in order to avoid any unnecessary confrontations.
Layton:
If you lost consciousness, then you did not see the Great Witch disappear, is that correct?
Barnham:
...Regrettably so.
Shade:
Liar! You did it! Because of you, the Great Witch is...
Barnham:
How many times must you accuse me?! A Court Knight is always true to his word!
Maya:
Wait, wait, WAIT! Then how do you explain all this blood everywhere?!
Layton:
Actually...I do not believe this is blood.
Maya:
...What?
Barnham:
...I did not draw my sword. No blood should have been spilt.
Maya:
Well then...what is it?
Layton:
It could be that strange liquid we saw the Shades brewing earlier.
Maya:
Oh! I think you're right! It sure smells like it...
Layton:
Perhaps one of these jars containing the liquid was knocked over during the struggle. The liquid must have splattered into the middle of the room, thus creating the scene we now see before us.
Maya:
I see... Now that you mention it, it does look like there's a broken jar on the floor over there...
Barnham:
...But can there really have been no other way for the Great Witch to have escaped?
Layton:
According to the Shades, there is not.
Barnham:
Then is the answer not clear? ...She must have used magic to disappear.
Layton:
Not quite. Magic is not the only method through which one can exit a locked room.
Maya:
Hey...are you saying this whole thing is like one giant puzzle, Professor?
Barnham:
She managed to disappear out of a locked room with no other apparent exits. What other method could there be...?
Layton:
Regardless, we must search the room thoroughly for any clues.
Maya:
You got it, Professor! I'm positive there's a clue or two lying around here somewhere!
Layton:
Indeed, Miss Fey. Shall we begin?
Examine
Throne
Leads to:
"Oh? What could this be...?"
Zacharias Barnham
Layton:
Inquisitor Barnham was most helpful. Let us not squander this chance, and explore the room while we can.
Layton:
Oh? What could this be...?
Maya:
Did you find something, Professor?
Layton:
Miss Fey, please come and take a look at this.
Maya:
It's a throne...
Layton:
This throne does not appear to have any of the red liquid on it.
Maya:
Sure looks that way.
Layton:
However, if we just move this to the side...
Maya:
Ah! It must have gotten shoved here during Inquisitor Barnham's mad struggle!
Barnham:
......
Maya:
But what does this mean?
Layton:
This throne does not have a single drop of the red liquid on it, yet the wall behind it does... Why do you think that is?
Maya:
Well...because the throne was in a different spot when Inquisitor Barnham was having the fight of his life?
Layton:
Very sound reasoning, Miss Fey. And who do you think could have moved it?
Maya:
Well... It must have been Inquisitor Barnham, when he was battling it out tooth and nail.
Barnham:
...'Twas not a battle fought with either teeth or [sic] nails. And I have no recollection of moving this throne at any stage.
Layton:
In other words, the only one who could have moved this throne was the Great Witch herself. And I believe moving this throne is in some way connected to what she did next.
Maya:
"What she did next"...? Oh! You mean her little disappearing act!
Barnham:
Hmph... Wielding that "logic" you love so much? But remember, this is the Great Witch we are discussing. She could have easily used a magic spell to disappear.
Shade:
Lies! The mistress' disappearance is your doing! You will return her at once!
Shade:
Please...bring her back to us...
Shade:
Grr! You detestable knight! We...we won't forget this!
Maya:
H-hold on a second! Wh-whoa! Wh-where did you guys get those weapons?!
Shade:
Tell us what really happened here... Tell us! There is nowhere for you to run!
Barnham:
......
Maya:
Uh-oh... This is NOT good! Inquisitor Barnham looks about ready to rip them to shreds...
Barnham:
HAAAAA!
Maya:
AHHHHH!
Shade:
...!
Barnham:
...Listen well, servants of the Great Witch. If you seek the truth, you must find it yourselves.
Shade:
G-gah...
Shade:
Urgh...
Maya:
Whoa... No wonder Inquisitor Barnham is so famous around town! He truly is an incredible knight!
Barnham:
I cannot waste any more time here. I must make haste and return to protect the Storyteller. Sir Top Hat... ...'Twas a pleasure crossing swords with you once again.
Layton:
...An honour, Inquisitor Barnham.
Barnham:
...Ms Fey. 
Maya:
Y-yeah...?
Barnham:
Your courageous acts of bravery are worthy of my respect and admiration.
Maya:
C-courageous acts of bravery...?
Barnham:
Hmph... That is all for now. Until next time...farewell!
Maya:
...He's gone.
Layton:
Perhaps the good inquisitor has anticipated the Great Witch making another appearance. He must have thought it's more important to work out her next move, rather than dwell on how she disappeared... Inquisitor Barnham is set on ensuring the Storyteller's safety and continuing the fight against the witches... He is quite determined to stay true to his responsibility as an inquisitor. Miss Fey, let us have one more good look around the room.
Maya:
Right! Let's find us some clues!
Layton:
We are certain to find something that can solve the mystery of how the Great Witch managed to seemingly disappear. Let's continue our investigation.
Examine
Stain on back wall
Leads to:
"Hey...Professor! Take a look at the wall where the chair was!"
Maya:
Hey...Professor! Take a look at the wall where the chair was! Doesn't it look like that wall could be a door leading to a secret passage?
Layton:
...As I suspected. It would seem the Great Witch did not really disappear into thin air. Although it is still unknown by what method she was able to make Inquisitor Barnham lose consciousness... we can assume she took advantage of the situation and escaped through this secret passage.
Maya:
But, Professor, even if we go after her now...do you think we'd catch her? What should we do?
Layton:
I believe she intended for us to discover this secret passage. It would seem she has us right in the palm of her hand. However... if we are to discover the truth, we must continue to move forward.
Maya:
You said it! All right! Let's get going, Professor!

I recommend we think of another possible way across. One that doesn't involve swimming, preferably.

Okay, guys! After me! I'm going in! One... Two...
Layton:
Wait a second, Miss Fey.
