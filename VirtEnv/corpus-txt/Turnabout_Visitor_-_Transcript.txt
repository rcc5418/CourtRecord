?????????
To make sure the defendant is found guilty. What other choice do I have? That's the job of a prosecutor, after all.
Th-That may be true, but why...? Why go this far?
Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear enough, but a guilty verdict is all that matters to me. No matter what the cost. I'm a prodigy among prosecutors. Always have been, always will be.
March 14, 2:05 AMProsecutor's Building12th Floor Hallway
Edgeworth:
(It's hard to believe that I've been away from my office for a whole month. I hope Detective Gumshoe has been keeping an eye on my office. And keeping it clean. Hm...? The door is unlocked...)
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe...? (Hm? What's this smell...? It's very familiar... Blood? Wh-What the!?) What's the meaning of this!?
???:
Freeze.
Edgeworth:
Identify yourself.
???:
.................. Shut up.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. You've got some nerve, committing murder in a prosecutor's office. Is that a threat?
???:
...
Edgeworth:
...Let me make one thing very clear.
???:
What?
Edgeworth:
No one gets away with committing murder in my office. No one.
???:
............
Edgeworth:
My name is Miles Edgeworth. And I work as a prosecutor in my local district. Little did I know that upon my return home after a month abroad... ...I would be thrust into a multitude of cases, and some very frantic and busy days.
March 14, 2:56 AMHigh Prosecutors' OfficesRoom 1202
Edgeworth:
.........
Forensics:
I've finished photographing the victim's body, sir!
Edgeworth:
Very well. Please continue your investigation.
Forensics:
Yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
.........
???:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mr. Edgeworth, sir!! Are you OK, sir!?
Edgeworth:
Keep it down, Detective. This is a crime scene.
???:
When I heard that a murder had taken place in your office, I ran up here straight away!
Edgeworth:
(This is Dick Gumshoe. He is a detective with the local precinct... ...and the one they assigned to handle this murder case for the time being.)
Gumshoe:
You're looking a little pale, sir! Are you hurt!?
Edgeworth:
No, I'm perfectly fine. However...
Gumshoe:
Ack! Look what they did to your office! It's totally trashed!
Edgeworth:
I'll say. The culprit sullied my floor with dirt rather well. No one gets away with tracking mud into my office.
Gumshoe:
Whoa! Sounds like you're getting really burned up over this whole thing!
Edgeworth:
This crime was committed in my office, so it is my responsibility to solve it.
Gumshoe:
Ho ho! That's just like you, Mr. Edgeworth! OK! Time to do some investigating!
Edgeworth:
Agreed. Our first course of action is to gather relevant facts and leads. (We must not overlook anything, no matter how small, if we are to find the truth. So I'll keep any leads or information we find etched in the forefront of my mind.) Speaking of things that pique my curiosity... Why of all places did the murder occur in my office (Crime scene: My office – Is it really coincidence that the murder took place in my office?)? (Hmm... I get the nagging feeling that this is something important to keep in mind.)
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I was wondering that myself, sir... I mean, you can't really say it's just a coincidence, can you?
Edgeworth:
No, not really. Especially because of this.
Gumshoe:
The key to your office (The office key – For security reasons, this office's door has a lock built into it.)? What do you mean, sir?
Edgeworth:
If you think about it carefully and use Logic, it should become clear to you.
Gumshoe:
Logic...?
Edgeworth:
By finding the connection between two pieces of information... ...and connecting them, new information is born. That is the end result of using Logic.
Gumshoe:
So how do you use it?
Edgeworth:
First, I recall information through the Logic Button, and then Connect them together. (Now, to touch the Logic Button and recall the facts.)
Logic
Connect "Crime scene: My office" and "The office key"
Leads to:
"For security reasons, all the prosecutors' doors are outfitted with locks."
Edgeworth:
For security reasons, all prosecutors' doors are outfitted with locks. Which means it would have been hard for the murderer and the victim to get in here. Ergo, it's impossible to dismiss the location of this crime as mere coincidence.
Gumshoe:
Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking, sir!
Edgeworth:
(There must be a reason why someone infiltrated my room... What was the killer after? (The killer's goal – Why did this happen in my office? What was the killer after?)
Gumshoe:
You're really on the ball today, Mr. Edgeworth! That's some beautiful Logic, sir!
Edgeworth:
Yes, well... When you follow leads to their conclusion, only the truth remains. (However... If the information doesn't line up properly, I may stray far from the truth as well... But if I think carefully before piecing leads together, the Logic should flow.) Well, let's get started with our investigation, shall we?
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Begin InvestigationHigh Prosecutors' Offices
Room 1202
Gumshoe:
The basis of any good investigation is to examine everything, sir!
Edgeworth:
I know that. And when I want to examine something, I simply touch the Examine Button.
Gumshoe:
Oh, if you ever feel lost and want to talk, just touch the Partner Button, OK!? I'll give you great, precise advice as an Ace Investigator, sir!
Edgeworth:
(*sigh* Something to try later if I have free time, I suppose.)
Examine
Forensics
Edgeworth:
How is it coming along?
Forensics:
Please, I need absolute silence. Fingerprint lifting is a delicate art!
Edgeworth:
(...Well, I never!)
Officer
Edgeworth:
Do you have anything to report?
Officer:
Sir, yes, sir! Nothing out of the ordinary right now, sir! And yet, there's something out of the ordinary right in front of my eyes.
Gumshoe:
Talk about a contradiction!
Edgeworth:
(Something out of the ordinary, huh... I should look around a bit more.)
Bouquet
Edgeworth:
...Is this... yet another batch of fresh flowers...?
Gumshoe:
The ones that come with a card attached every month like clockwork for you? Yup. Speaking of that! Let's see what's on the card this month, sir!"All will be resolved.--Wendy"?
Edgeworth:
(Oh, Ms. Irony... How painful are thy thorns.)
Gumshoe:
Wendy... Isn't that the name of that old lady with the whiny voice that's stalk--
Edgeworth:
That's enough, Detective. You need not remind me further. *shudder*
Steel Samurai doll
Edgeworth:
Well, it's a good thing my Steel Samurai doll was spared any harm.
Gumshoe:
Speaking of which, I still haven't actually sat down and watched any of that show. What's it about again?
Edgeworth:
Well, I don't know much about it myself, but... ...the hero of "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo" is the Steel Samurai... ...and his goal is to defeat the Evil Magistrate. It's a show geared towards kids... ...however its high production values and riveting plot draws in a number of adults as well. Spin-offs like "Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo" and "The Nickel Samurai"... ...along with the deluge of merchandise, and even a new stage show, gives it presence.
Gumshoe:
You... sure know a lot. Are you sure you're not some sort of rabid fanboy?
Edgeworth:
...! O-Of course not! Anyone that keeps up with society know at least this much! And that conversation lasted longer than expected. Let us return to the investigation!
King of Prosecutors shield
Gumshoe:
Oh, it's your trophy! The um... Knight of Prosecutors, right!?
Edgeworth:
...King. King of Prosecutors. And it's not a trophy; it's a shield.
Gumshoe:
They only send this to the winning prosecutor, right!?
Edgeworth:
...Yes, but I have no real interest in the perceived worth of other people. As for my own worth, that is something only I can determine for myself.
Gumshoe:
Th-that's so slick, sir! I'm gonna have to try saying that sometime!
Edgeworth:
(Unfortunately for him, his monetary worth is tied directly to his worth to me.)
Broken tea set
Gumshoe:
Ah! Watch out for the tea cup fragments there, sir!
Edgeworth:
.........Nnngh... That killer is going to pay! This tea set...!
Gumshoe:
Yikes! You're really mad over this!
Edgeworth:
This tea set is very dear to my heart and can only be bought in England. It cost more than your whole month's paycheck.
Gumshoe:
Wh...Whaaaaaaaat!? Now I feel like the killer's wasted one of my monthly paychecks!
Desk
Edgeworth:
It's been a while since I've sat at this desk. Oh, how I've missed you. ...Hm? It's so tidy that it looks newer than when I first bought it.
Gumshoe:
Ho ho, yeah! That thing's so polished that it makes mirrors jealous!
Edgeworth:
Don't tell me you had no other work the entire time I was away, Detective...
Gumshoe:
My job is to protect your office, sir!
Edgeworth:
...And you did such a good job protecting it that a murder occur in it.
Gumshoe:
............ That's harsh, sir...
Edgeworth:
(I have to admit the desk has never looked better, so I guess I can't dock his pay.)
Sofa
Edgeworth:
I hope we can solve this case quickly. I'd like to return to relaxing on this sofa.
Gumshoe:
That thing looks a billion times softer than my mattress at home! C-Can I sit on it, too? Just for a little while, sir?
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. You know I can't allow that. Until this case is solved, neither of us has time to spare, let alone rest.
Gumshoe:
...! You're right, sir! I'm gonna work hard and be a real trooper to the end!
Edgeworth:
(Even once this case is over, I don't think he can afford to take any time off...)
Revolver
Edgeworth:
What have we here...? (Could this perhaps be the murder weapon? If so, it would mean that the killer made their escape after disposing of their gun here.)
Gumshoe:
I think I've seen one of these before... Hmm...
Edgeworth:
Care to enlighten me as to where?
Gumshoe:
Oh! I know! I was issued the exact same model! .........I think.
Edgeworth:
*sigh* Detective...
Gumshoe:
I don't really like guns all that much. I mean, they're really dangerous! But now that I think about it, you do see this model around the precinct a lot, sir. I don't use mine much, except in emergencies, so that's why I didn't recognize it...
Edgeworth:
(So it's the same type of revolver (Revolver - Found at the crime scene, it's the same model as those used by precinct detectives.) as the ones used by this precinct's detectives...)
After Logic "Victim was a detective" is added
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, I seem to have gathered a few pieces of pertinent information. Now to calmly use some Logic and figure out if any of them are connected to each other.)
Revolver (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
So the detectives of this precinct all use this same model of revolver?
Gumshoe:
I guess. I don't really like guns, but at least I do know the different types out there!
Edgeworth:
(At least he knows SOMETHING related to his job.)
Files
Gumshoe:
Your files are all over the floor, sir.
Edgeworth:
They probably fell during the struggle between the victim and his killer (Signs of a struggle - My files are a mess, pointing to a struggle between the victim and the killer.).
Gumshoe:
Aww, and I tried so hard to keep this place spotless while you were away... I mean, this just rendered all the time and effort I put in pointless!
Edgeworth:
I don't recall ever asking you to clean my room!
Gumshoe:
Well, I watered the flowers every day, just like you requested, sir. I just added cleaning to the list as a weekend special! For about half a day every Saturday, I'd come in and clean this place until it sparkled!
Edgeworth:
(Does he have a life...?)
Chessboard
Gumshoe:
Ouch, they even knocked over your chess set! I had it all set up, ready for when you got back. I figured we could play a few games.
Edgeworth:
I had no idea you were interested in chess.
Gumshoe:
I'm actually pretty good at checkers, so I thought I'd give chess a try.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... In that case, I suppose I can set some time aside after we solve this case. (Though I don't expect the games to tax my mental acuity much.)
Body
Edgeworth:
(They finished photographing the body, so it should be alright to examine this area. I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Files
Gumshoe:
Your files are all over the floor, sir.
Edgeworth:
They probably fell during the struggle between the victim and his killer (Signs of a struggle - My files are a mess, pointing to a struggle between the victim and the killer.).
Gumshoe:
Aww, and I tried so hard to keep this place spotless while you were away... I mean, this just rendered all the time and effort I put in pointless!
Edgeworth:
I don't recall ever asking you to clean my room!
Gumshoe:
Well, I watered the flowers every day, just like you requested, sir. I just added cleaning to the list as a weekend special! For about half a day every Saturday, I'd come in and clean this place until it sparkled!
Edgeworth:
(Does he have a life...?)
Shelf
Gumshoe:
I don't believe it! I packed those files on these shelves so tight... ...that not even an earthquake could make them fall off, but just look at them! At this rate, the rest of the files won't be able to withstand an earthquake at all!
Edgeworth:
...A-A problem to be sure. Well, once the investigation is over, we'll put them back up on the shelf.
Body
Before the holster is revealed
Edgeworth:
Let's see here...
After the holster is revealed
Edgeworth:
Let's give the body a once over.
Edgeworth:
Hmm, there's blood all over his lower abdominal area.
Gumshoe:
It looks like the bullet passed clean through his stomach area, sir...
Edgeworth:
In other words, he was shot.
Gumshoe:
Yup. And until the autopsy's done, I don't think we'll know much more than that.
Edgeworth:
Please have the body sent to the morgue once they're done processing the crime scene.
Crime Scene Notes jotted down in my Organizer.
If first evidence added to Organizer
Gumshoe:
Are you going to be OK with keeping track of the evidence we find, sir?
Edgeworth:
Of course. This is the safest way I know to keep track of it all.
Gumshoe:
Alright, if you say so!
Edgeworth:
(I keep all the evidence I find either in or with my Organizer. When I want to re-examine a piece, I have but to touch the Organizer Button. But the Organizer isn't only for evidence; I keep people's profiles on hand in it, too. It's probably a good idea to make a habit of checking the facts often.)

Holster
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faith's holster... I bet he never thought he'd be killed by his own gun.
Gumshoe:
Yeah... Shot down by the very thing that's supposed to protect the people. I just can't get over that, sir! It's not right! We're gonna get the killer for this!
Edgeworth:
(Maybe it's because the victim is a fellow detective... ...but for a second, Gumshoe sounded even more detective-like than usual.)
Bloodstain around waist
Gumshoe:
There's some blood on the back of his pants... Which reminds me of this one time... Back in elementary school, I accidentally flopped onto this chair that had a tack on it... And oh man, that thing stabbed me good! It even drew blood! Hurts just thinking about it.
Edgeworth:
(That story was so painful, I spaced out in the middle of it...)
Wallet
Edgeworth:
What do we have here...?
Gumshoe:
Hey, I think I've seen one of these before...
Edgeworth:
It's a police badge, Detective...
Gumshoe:
Oh, hey! I have the exact same thing, actually! What a coinkidink!
Edgeworth:
......... Let's take a look inside. Mr. Buddy Faith... It would appear that our victim was a detective (Victim was a detective - According to his badge and ID, Buddy Faith was a precinct detective.), just like you.
After Logic "Revolver" is added

Body (subsequent times, after examining body, wallet, and files)
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Examine evidence
Prosecutor's Badge
Front of badge
Edgeworth:
This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.
Back of badge
Edgeworth:
Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!
Victim's Revolver
Trigger
Edgeworth:
To think that it's so easy to take a life with just the pull of a trigger...
Gumshoe:
You know, I can't ever see myself really liking guns. Oh! But I love the ones they use at track and field meets to start races! If you take off before it's fired, everybody always ends up following your lead!
Edgeworth:
...To chase you down for a false start, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Now that you mention it, even when I finish last, I always wind up in last place...
Barrel of gun
Edgeworth:
(It looks like only one round was fired from this.)
Gumshoe:
Wow, so the killer killed the vic with just one shot after wrestling the gun from him? Sounds like the guy knew how to handle a gun, huh, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
We have no proof for now, but that is a distinct possibility...
Logic
Connect "Victim was a detective" and "Revolver"
Edgeworth:
The revolver, the standard model used by detectives... Could it have belonged to our recently departed? Detective Gumshoe, could you please thoroughly check the victim's body one more time?
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! On it now, sir! 'Scuse me, pal... Let's see... What have we got here... Mr. Edgeworth, sir! This guy's wearing a gun holster!
Edgeworth:
Hmm, so it appears that our killer somehow managed to take the victim's gun from him.
Victim's Revolver data jotted down in my Organizer.
If first evidence added to Organizer
Gumshoe:
Are you going to be OK with keeping track of the evidence we find, sir?
Edgeworth:
Of course. This is the safest way I know to keep track of it all.
Gumshoe:
Alright, if you say so!
Edgeworth:
(I keep all the evidence I find either in or with my Organizer. When I want to re-examine a piece, I have but to touch the Organizer Button. But the Organizer isn't only for evidence; I keep people's profiles on hand in it, too. It's probably a good idea to make a habit of checking the facts often.)
Edgeworth:
(Let's see what else we can find out about this revolver.)
Gumshoe:
As I always say, you've gotta look really carefully at each piece of evidence! You can use the Scroll Wheels to rotate an object. There's no such thing as a bad angle! Use the Slide Bar or the X and Y Arrows to zoom in and out to get at the nitty gritty!
Examine Trigger
Edgeworth:
To think that it's so easy to take a life with just the pull of a trigger...
Gumshoe:
You know, I can't ever see myself really liking guns. Oh! But I love the ones they use at track and field meets to start races! If you take off before it's fired, everybody always ends up following your lead!

Examine Barrel
Edgeworth:
(It looks like only one round was fired from this.)
Gumshoe:
Wow, so the killer killed the vic with just one shot after wrestling the gun from him? Sounds like the guy knew how to handle a gun, huh, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
We have no proof for now, but that is a distinct possibility...
Leads back to investigation
Partner
Gumshoe:
You called, sir?
Talk
Notice anything?
Edgeworth:
Is there anything you noticed that you'd like to share, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Just that I rushed over here as soon as I heard there was a murder in your office, sir! The investigation's just gotten started, so I guess there's not much else to say. So, uh, were you the one that found the body, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately. Upon my return, I found my office door to be unlocked. And what awaited me inside was this whole messy affair.
Gumshoe:
Ouch, that's rough...
Edgeworth:
Even though I left the security of this room to a "certain detective"...
Gumshoe:
S-Sorry, sir...
About investigating
Edgeworth:
I assume you understand how to conduct investigations, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Of course, sir! Examine things by tapping them or by touching the Examine Button! By checking various things out, we gather evidence and information. You can see the evidence we've collected by touching the Organizer Button. For information... information... um...
Edgeworth:
For information and leads, it's the Logic Button.
Gumshoe:
That's it! Great job, sir! Deductive reasonable is the way to go!
Edgeworth:
(It's called "Deductive reasoning", Detective... Clearly, something you lack.)
The info I've gathered (after examining files, body, wallet, and revolver)
Edgeworth:
I seem to have picked up a few good leads.
Gumshoe:
Oh! So now you're gonna do that thing you do with all that information, right?
Edgeworth:
What are you babbling about?
Gumshoe:
The brainy thing you were talking about just a few minutes ago, sir! Um... Logic! You said that you can look at all of your leads and info by touching the Logic Button. Then you pick the pieces you want to connect by touching them and hitting Connect. That's your way of investigating, right, sir?
Edgeworth:
Yes, which is why this exercise in explaining my own method to me was unnecessary.
Gumshoe:
OK, then how about I explain MY Logic to you next!?
Edgeworth:
That is even more unnecessary!
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Gumshoe:
Your Prosecutor's Badge is really tiny compared to my police badge. Oh! But, um...... It's really cool, sir! Much, much cooler than my badge could ever be!
Edgeworth:
...There's no need to suck up to me, Detective.
Gumshoe:
..................
Victim's Revolver
Gumshoe:
The victim's gun, huh. It's the same model as mine.
Edgeworth:
A tool used to protect lives, yet one that can also take lives away. Those who take a gun in hand wield a great responsibility. I hope you understand that.
Gumshoe:
I don't really use my gun at all, sir. The only time I would use this baby is... ...when I'm fighting a hot duel with a convict to look ultra cool!
Edgeworth:
*sigh* You were doing so well until that last bit.
Anything else
Gumshoe:
I'm just a lowly detective, so... ...I'm not sure what I should do with that other than to arrest it!
Edgeworth:
(Is that the only talent you have...? Oh, wait...)
After examining body, files, and barrel of gun:
Edgeworth:
(I guess this is about all we're going to find out. We should send the body to aut--)
???:
Jim! Why, oh why!? How could this have happened to a guy like you!?
Edgeworth:
......... Are you alright?
???:
Don't touch me! Leave me alone! Just let me be!
Edgeworth:
Sorry, but I can't do that. The investigation is still ongoing, so please refrain from touching the body.
???:
The "body"? The "BODY"!? Don't talk about him like he's just some lump of flesh! Look at him... Jim looks like he's just turned in for the night.
Gumshoe:
Um, sure. Just in a blood-stained suit, pal.
???:
Where are my manners?
Edgeworth:
Aren't you that prosecutor...
Portsman:
Why, yes, I am! I'm Jacques Portsman, Prosecutor. Jim here was my partner in crime busting...
Edgeworth:
I'm Miles Edgeworth, and like you, I am also a prosecutor.
Gumshoe:
Detective Dick Gumshoe, sir.
Portsman:
So you're Miles Edgeworth... I guess this is your office...?
Edgeworth:
Yes, that is correct.
Portsman:
Then it was you! You're the one who killed Jim!
Gumshoe:
Hey, don't go around jumping to conclusions, pal! Just calm down, OK!?
Portsman:
I will not! I know how things work around here! High prosecutors' office doors all have locks built into them. And only the owner of the office has the key to his or her own office door!
Edgeworth:
That is correct. However, I was not the one who killed your partner.
Gumshoe:
Yeah! Mr. Edgeworth has been overseas on a business trip this whole time, pal. And the key to the door was with me the entire time, OK!? So the only one who could get in here was me! Ho ho ho ho. ...Wait, that means... ......... I'm not sure what that means.
Portsman:
So it was you, then! You're Jim's killer!!
Gumshoe:
No way, pal! You've got it all wrong!!
Edgeworth:
Everyone calm down!
Portsman:
...!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Portsman, correct? If you are a real prosecutor, you should know to stay collected. The investigation has only just begun. Isn't it too early to be drawing conclusions?
Portsman:
...Alright, I get the point. You're right, my mistake. I tend to get a little too hot-headed sometimes. You sure are one cool customer, though, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
.........
Portsman:
I've heard all the rumors about you. You're the great "Genius Prosecutor". You're something of a legend, you know. Anyway! Let's call a truce and work together, OK? Now, how about a handshake to seal the deal!?
Edgeworth:
............ A pleasure to work with you.
Portsman:
You guys were conducting your investigation, right? Sorry for barging in like that. Carry on, then. It's your room, after all.
Edgeworth:
Thank you, I intend to.
Portsman:
I just want a little more time to say good-bye to Jim... You there!
Forensics:
Sir!
Portsman:
I want you to capture this scene on film for me. My final farewell to my partner Jim...
Edgeworth:
............ (I should probably give them some space...)
Examine
Jacket in frame
Leads to:
"Ah! Your jacket, sir! What's it doing on the floor!?"
Forensics
Edgeworth:
How is it coming along?
Forensics:
Please, I need absolute silence. This picture is too important to mess up.
Edgeworth:
(I'll just leave the man to his art.)
Portsman
Edgeworth:
Mr. Portsman. A word, if I may.
Portsman:
Jim... I swear I'll find your killer and bring them to justice! You wait and see. It'll be for the both of us! Now then! You wanted to talk to me about something?
Edgeworth:
...Um, no. That's alright. (I feel like I'm interrupting their... conversation.)
Gumshoe:
Ah! Your jacket, sir! What's it doing on the floor!?
Edgeworth:
It must have fallen off the wall when the killer tried to threaten me by firing a round.
Gumshoe:
So the killer not only shot the victim, but they shot your jacket as well!? They dared to shoot the ultra-special jacket that you made your prosecutorial debut in!? What if they had shot through it!? It would've been a disaster!
Edgeworth:
It's not worth getting worked up over, Detective. Not when there's something more here.
Gumshoe:
Huh? Like what?
Edgeworth:
I take it you haven't noticed it yet, Detective. There is a giant contradiction right here in front of us.
Gumshoe:
Really!?
Edgeworth:
(Did I say "contradiction"? He must be rubbing off on me. I'm starting to sound like him... But I have my own methods and I will conduct this investigation my way. When the scene before me contradicts a piece of evidence or seems off... ...that's when my deductive skills come into play. First, I have to find the spot that holds the contradiction.)
Move cursor over bullet hole
Leads to:
"This is it. This bullet hole is where the contradiction lies!"
Examine sofa
Gumshoe:
Looks like your sofa was spared! Talk about good luck!
Edgeworth:
And just what is so lucky about that?
Gumshoe:
Well, I'd hate for my napping spot to have a huge hole in it.
Edgeworth:

Gumshoe:
J-J-Just joking, sir! Honest! I wouldn't dream of sleeping on such a nice, comfy sofa...
Edgeworth:
(He just keeps digging himself deeper and deeper with each passing word...)
Examine jacket
Gumshoe:
This jacket sure brings back memories! I remember you used to wear this around the time you became a certified prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
It was a present from my mentor.
Gumshoe:
Prosecutor Manfred von Karma, huh...
Edgeworth:
Yes... I don't wear it anymore, yet I can't bring myself to throw it away...
Gumshoe:
It must mean a lot to you... Even with the little bittersweet memories it holds... Ah, but you know, I've got an old coat of mine hanging up in my room too, sir! ...Yesterday was laundry day, so it's just drying off, but you get the picture.
Edgeworth:
(This is it. This bullet hole is where the contradiction lies! When I spot something that's off, I should touch the Deduce Button with conviction!)
Deduce
Leads to:
"And when I have found sufficient proof to prove the contradiction, I Present it!"
Edgeworth:
(And when I have found sufficient proof to prove the contradiction, I Present it! This is how I do things.)
Present Victim's Revolver
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"This bullet hole is the contradiction!"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
This is clearly where the contradiction lies!
Gumshoe:
I don't really see what's so wrong with that spot...
Edgeworth:
Hah. You don't understand? You see, therein lies the contradiction.
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth, sir... It'd be nice if you'd just admit when you're wrong...
Edgeworth:
Th-That wasn't a mistake! That was me keeping you on your toes, Detective! (When the crime scene and the evidence don't add up, I Present proof to show where!)
Leads back to:
"This is how I do things."
Edgeworth:
This bullet hole is the contradiction!
Gumshoe:
Wh-What do you mean, sir!?
Edgeworth:
It's elementary. Two shots were fired in this room. The first felled the victim... ...and the second felled this frame.
Gumshoe:
Hey, that's right!
Edgeworth:
However, this gun was only fired once.
Gumshoe:
Hey, that's true, too...
Edgeworth:
Which means that one of these two bullets was fired from a different gun. (Did the killer have another gun (Another handgun – Other than the victim's gun that I found, could there be another gun in play here?) prepared for tonight...?)
Gumshoe:
By the way, I noticed something, sir...
Edgeworth:
Yes?
Gumshoe:
What's that thing sticking out from behind the frame?
Edgeworth:
Ah, that. It's a secret safe.
Gumshoe:
A s-secret safe!? Oh, I smell money!
Edgeworth:
I'll spare us the trouble and just say it. Nothing like what you're imagining is inside. Now, if you could kindly move this frame out of the way.
Gumshoe:
Roger that! *achoo* *achoo* Talk about dusty!
Edgeworth:
I suppose that's what happens when I'm not here to dust it once in a while.
Gumshoe:
I had no idea there was a safe here, or I'd have kept it clean for you, sir! So when did you put this thing in?
Edgeworth:
It wasn't something I had installed personally. Every prosecutor's office has one.
Gumshoe:
Really!? I had no idea!
Edgeworth:
Well, only prosecutors are supposed to have knowledge of their existence.
Gumshoe:
So... what's inside, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
Right now? Nothing. We only use them to store especially important evidence when a trial is in session.
Gumshoe:
That's it...? Talk about squashing my hopes and dreams...

Safe door
Gumshoe:
I never knew there was a safe hidden back here!
Edgeworth:
Well, if detectives knew about them, then they wouldn't be "secret" now would they?
Gumshoe:
Are there any other secret, hidden things in this room?
Edgeworth:
Even if there were, it would defeat the purpose of them being "hidden" if I told you. So don't bother looking for them.
Gumshoe:
S-So there's no, like, hidden camera around, right?
Edgeworth:
Hm? And what if there was...?
Gumshoe:
A-Ah! No, it's nothing! Forget I said anything!
Edgeworth:
(Do I even want to ask what he's been doing in my office while I've been away!?)
Revolver
Edgeworth:
It's the victim's gun.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and I guess there's one more, right?
Edgeworth:
We certainly can't discount the possibility. However, we must then ask ourselves, why would the killer leave evidence behind?
Gumshoe:
It's not exactly something you'd put down and forget about...
Edgeworth:
...Not unless we're talking about you, Detective. (There's something unusual about the killer's actions. And none of it is adding up. What does it all mean?)

I had no idea you had one of these things! I mean, I thought I knew everything there is to know about you, Mr. Edgeworth! I feel like I've caught a glimpse of the hidden side of Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(There's a great deal you don't know about me... At least, I hope so...)
Edgeworth:
(Hm...? Now this is odd...)
Gumshoe:
You found something, sir?
Edgeworth:
This keypad... Don't you find it to be a bit too clean?
Gumshoe:
Yeah! There's a thick layer of dust all around it, but not on the keypad itself.
Edgeworth:
You there, the forensic scientist!
Forensics:
Yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
Could you please dust this area for fingerprints?
Forensics:
You got it, sir!
Edgeworth:
............
Forensics:
I couldn't find, let alone lift, a single print. Looks like it was wiped down well (Wiped fingerprints – All of the fingerprints on this have been wiped clean off.).

Edgeworth:
There's dust on the rest of the safe, but not here on this keypad.
Gumshoe:
According to the forensic scientist, he couldn't find a single print, sir.
Edgeworth:
That the keypad to the safe was wiped down this carefully... Hmm... Perhaps I should take a good look at all the information we've collected so far.
Logic
Connect "The killer's goal" and "Wiped fingerprints"
Edgeworth:
I believe I have figured out what the murderer was after.
Gumshoe:
Well, what is it, sir!?
Edgeworth:
The fact that the safe was wiped clean of fingerprints suggests... ...that the criminal had at least attempted to open my safe. Making the culprit's motive for breaking and entering, theft (Motive: Theft (?) – The culprit tried to open my safe. Was the killer's motive theft?), I believe. (I wonder if knowing that the motive behind this break-in was theft... ...changes what the other pieces of information can tell me about this crime?)
Connect "Signs of a struggle" and "Motive: Theft (?)"
Leads to:
"There is a possibility that the files splayed on the floor..."
Edgeworth:
There is a possibility that the files splayed on the floor... ...are not the result of a struggle between the victim and his killer.
Gumshoe:
Oh! You mean like it could be from when the killer tried to find something, sir!?
Edgeworth:
Precisely. We need to figure out if any of the files have been stolen.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! I'm gonna shelve files like you've never seen before, even at a library!
Edgeworth:
Um, sure... Let's give that a try...
Portsman:
Why do all the good ones always die young? Surely you must ponder that every once in a while, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
......... No matter how much we lament, the dead will not come back to life. All we can do is search for the truth.
Portsman:
......... And? So what are we supposed to do? How do we go about finding the truth?
Edgeworth:
First, we calmly restore the files to their rightful place.
Portsman:
You got it! Here, let me help!
Gumshoe:
Um, so this file goes here, and that book goes there...
Portsman:
You sure know a lot about where things go, despite it being Mr. Edgeworth's office.
Gumshoe:
Because I'm the one who keeps it tidy, pal! OK! Done!
Edgeworth:
It would appear that the murder was definitely committed here.
Gumshoe:
Unnngh... The bloodstains on the bookshelf are still fresh...
Edgeworth:
I suspect that the victim was killed in a standing position, hence the prints on the shelf.
Gumshoe:
And then the guy fell onto the floor, right? The blood on the floor's kinda grossing me out!
Edgeworth:
...Detective, I don't have the time to deal with your weak stomach right now.
Gumshoe:
Nnngh... But you know I'm no good with blood, sir...

Bloody handprints
Gumshoe:
The victim's handprints...
Edgeworth:
He must have tried to support himself with his hands here after being shot.
Gumshoe:
There are prints on the floor, too.
Edgeworth:
Those must have been made when, unable to stay standing, he dropped to the floor.
Files
Gumshoe:
I put them all back, just as they should be, sir! Doesn't look like anything's missing!
Edgeworth:
Although, it does look like the killer moved the body to flip through my shelves. (I wonder if they found what they were looking for...?)
Bullet hole
Gumshoe:
So this is where the bullet lodged itself after it went through the victim, huh.
Edgeworth:
For the bullet to be lodged so squarely in a file spine... ...indicates that the files were ransacked after the shooting had occurred.
Gumshoe:
Then I guess the victim was moved because he was in the killer's way...
Large bloodstain
Edgeworth:
It appears that the victim was in a sitting position here after being shot.
Gumshoe:
Oh! So that's why the seat of the victim's pants has blood on it!
Edgeworth:
That would be the logical conclusion.
Body
Edgeworth:
The killer moved the body because it was leaning against the bookshelf.
Gumshoe:
The blood on this guy's pants proves that pretty well!
Edgeworth:
In a sense, I suppose.
Gumshoe:
See! I'm not completely useless, Mr. Edgeworth!

Edgeworth:
Do you have anything to report?
Officer:
Sir, yes, sir! Seeing Mr. Portsman tearing up like that... ...has brought an unstoppable torrent of tears to my own eyes, sir!
Gumshoe:
...Were you good friends with Mr. Faith, pal?
Officer:
No, sir! But I can't help myself. I'm sympathetic to other people's tears!
Edgeworth:
...If I may make a suggestion, I'd clean myself up so as to not give the wrong impression.
Portsman
Edgeworth:
Mr. Portsman. A word, if I may.
Portsman:
Oh, Jim... Your laugh, your smile... I'll never be able to joke around with you again... But don't you worry, Jim! I'll joke around for the both of us! You'll see!

Crime scene oddity
Edgeworth:
So? Any keen insights, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Well, I noticed that you... haven't found anything odd about the crime scene yet! That's unlike you, sir! If you spot something that seems off, you should check it out! All you have to do is line the cursor up with where you see a contradiction... ...and hit the Deduce Button. But after that, you've still gotta back up your hunch. Pick the piece of evidence that does the job and Present it, sir! It's that easy!
Edgeworth:
And I suppose you've spotted something already, which is why you explained all this?
Gumshoe:
Um, not really... But hey! That's what you're here for, Mr. Edgeworth! To find them all in a jiffy!
Edgeworth:
(Beaming with overconfidence as he none too subtly cries for assistance.)
Edgeworth:
There is clearly a contradiction here with this bullet hole!
Gumshoe:
Wh-What do you mean, sir!?
Edgeworth:
You don't see? Quite simply, the bullet hole itself is too low. If the victim was shot in the stomach, the hole should be much higher up.
Gumshoe:
But what if the guy was shot while he was sitting or lying down, sir!?
Edgeworth:
That would be illogical. The victim leaned against this shelf here after being shot. Which suggests that he was standing when he was shot.
Gumshoe:
Then that means...! ............Wait, what does that mean, sir?
Edgeworth:
It means you need to use your brain every once in a while instead of mine, Detective. In any case, it means someone made a faulty assumption. And it was from this mistake that our current contradiction was born! What is the faulty assumption that caused this problem with the bullet hole's position?
The position of the body
Edgeworth:
If the victim was shot while he was lying down...
Gumshoe:
Wait... Didn't you just say that line of reasoning is illogical, sir? You said, "The victim leaned against this shelf here after being shot."
Edgeworth:
...I was trying to be nice and explain my complex logic in an easier way for you, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Oh, really!? Thanks for thinking of me, sir!
Edgeworth:
(...Good, I don't think he noticed my mistake.)
Leads back to:
"What is the faulty assumption that caused this problem with the bullet hole's position?"
The position of the handprints
Edgeworth:
The position of the handprints is what's causing this problem. We wouldn't be in this dilemma if the handprints were closer to the ground!
Gumshoe:
But the handprints are where they are... Up top.
Edgeworth:
...Yes, you are quite perceptive! Which is why this is not a viable hypothesis.
Gumshoe:
Oh, so it was just a "what if"? Then what's the right answer?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... You still can't figure it out? Then allow me to explain.
Gumshoe:
Yes, please, sir!
Edgeworth:
(Guess he didn't notice the slip-up. Although, at this point, I shouldn't be surprised.)
Leads back to:
"What is the faulty assumption that caused this problem with the bullet hole's position?"
The order of the files
Leads to:
"I believe the order of the files is a bit off."
Edgeworth:
I believe the order of the files is a bit off.
Gumshoe:
You mean I put them back in the wrong order just now? Hey! Actually, I think the labels on the files are wrong, sir!
Edgeworth:
Oh?
Gumshoe:
Yeah! You see here how the files that were shot begin with the number 0? What are those doing all the way down there after 1, 2, and 3!? That's really weird!!
Edgeworth:
Actually, the way they are organized now is the correct order. They are exactly as I see them in my mind's eye.
Gumshoe:
But the numbers are all out of order.
Edgeworth:
Those white binders are special, so they are arranged a little differently. But from this, we know that the files were not in this order when the crime occurred. (Aha! So that's it!) I believe the killer made the same incorrect assumption as you just did, Detective. Let's re-arrange the files in numerical order and see what we find out.
Gumshoe:
Do you think it'd be OK to prop the body back up to how it was before it was moved?
Edgeworth:
They've finished processing the crime scene, so I don't see why it wouldn't be. If you please, Detective Gumshoe!
Edgeworth:
As I suspected... The bullet hole is now where it should logically be. The killer went through my files first before shooting Mr. Faith.
Gumshoe:
And then put the files back in numerical order, I guess.
Edgeworth:
Exactly. And then proceeded to shoot the victim.
Gumshoe:
But why would someone kill a man and then look through your files one more time?
Edgeworth:
Puzzling indeed. The files were thrown into disarray twice (Files in disarray - The culprit re-arranged my files twice, once before and once after the murder. Why?), once before and once after the crime. But why?

There must be some reason as to why the victim's body was moved. But there is no time to ponder that now. Let us continue with our investigation, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Roger that, sir! I'm raring to go!
Bloody handprints
Gumshoe:
These handprints belong to the victim, right? They make sense with the body position.
Edgeworth:
Yes, he must have left them when he was trying to support himself after he was shot. (However, the final position of the body shows that it was moved... I need to go over this crime scene with a fine-toothed comb one more time.)
Bullet hole
Edgeworth:
As I suspected... The bullet hole is now where it should logically be.
Gumshoe:
And we figured out that the killer went through your bookshelf twice.
Edgeworth:
Indeed... There are many things the killer did that don't make sense. But to figure out the whys, we need more information.
Edgeworth:
Th-This...!
Gumshoe:
Wh-What is that!? Why does it say "Gumshoe" on there in blood!?
Portsman:
I'd say it's some incredibly incriminating evidence...
Edgeworth:
Yes, indicative of criminal activity, indeed.
Gumshoe:
No! Wait! There's gotta be some mistake! Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Help me! Say something, sir!
Edgeworth:

Gumshoe:
Is that all, sir!? What about me and my situation!?

Portsman:
Looks like Jim was able to leave us the name of his killer in the end. And this most important message managed to reach us.
Gumshoe:
I'm telling you! It wasn't me!!!
Portsman:
You can't be terribly pleased to hear that your beloved partner is the guilty party.
Edgeworth:
If you are going to accuse Detective Gumshoe of being the culprit... ...I sincerely hope you have some proof to back it up.
Portsman:
Jim's words... They're more than enough, wouldn't you say?
Edgeworth:
If that's how you want to play it, then at least allow me to understand your reasoning.
Portsman:
You got it!
Edgeworth:
(I don't like this one bit. There's something strange about this man's attitude. And there must be some sort of flaw to his logic waiting for me to dig out.)
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you going to do?
Edgeworth:
What I always do in court; I'm going to cross-examine him. One way or another, I'll expose the flaw in his logic with this technique.
Gumshoe:
Ooh! How do you do that!? C-Can you explain it to me, sir!?
Might as well.
Edgeworth:
Alright. First, I listen to the witness's testimony. If I find a flaw in the testimony, something that contradicts the evidence... ...I open the Organizer and Present the piece of contradictory evidence! (To Present something, I simply touch the Present Button, but that's old news.)
Gumshoe:
But it's not like there's gonna be a flaw in their testimony every time, right!?
Edgeworth:
Correct, and at those times, I need to Press the witness by touching the Press Button. Sometimes by pressing, I can draw out new information, and new or modified testimony.
Gumshoe:
I think I get it, sir! I'll be sure to try this technique out during investigations, too!
Edgeworth:
Very well. I'll even show you how it's done. Now watch carefully.

Edgeworth:
You intend to argue that the victim's dying message points to his killer...?
Portsman:
I can hear Jim's voice, and he's calling for his killer's arrest!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Are you sure you're not mishearing his words, Mr. Portsman? (There is no way Detective Gumshoe is the culprit here... I will find the flaw in this man's logic... ...and expose it with credible evidence!)

Edgeworth:
You know, there's something I've been meaning to ask...
Portsman:
Hm? What is it?
Edgeworth:
Why do you call the victim "Jim"... ...when clearly, his name is "Buddy Faith"...?
Portsman:
Isn't it obvious? "Jim" is the perfect name for my companion. "Jacques and Jim". Don't those two names go together like peanut butter and jam?
Gumshoe:
But "Jim" isn't even close to the guy's real name...
Portsman:
Well, "Jacques and Buddy" just sounds... off somehow. Besides, he was the third of a bunch of guys I decided to nickname "Jim".
Edgeworth:
(Hmph. He talks about the victim like he was his pet.)
Portsman:
Further, you messed up the files to make it look like you had committed theft instead.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Do you really think it was necessary to dishevel my shelves twice to do that?
Portsman:
That's true... Ok, then maybe his real intent WAS theft.
Gumshoe:
Hey! Are you accusing me of stealing something from Mr. Edgeworth!?
Portsman:
It's a possibility. Maybe your salary's been cut so much that life is getting a little too rough to handle...?
Gumshoe:
I'll have you know that I eat three square meals every day, pal! ...OK, so all three of them happen to be instant noodles, but...
Portsman:
Poor thing. What an evil prosecutor you were paired up with. And what a motive, no?
Portsman:
That's when you moved Jim's body that was sitting in front of the bookshelf!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
And why would Detective Gumshoe do such a thing?
Portsman:
Because the body was getting in his way. He had to mess up your bookshelf somehow, right? Anyway...
Portsman:
But thanks to that, you didn't notice the bloody letters his body was hiding.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Why do you think that the killer didn't notice the bloody letters?
Portsman:
The body was covering it quite well, wouldn't you say? That's how he missed it. But judging by what I've seen, it doesn't take much for your detective to miss something.
Gumshoe:
Who do you think you are!? You know nothing about me, pal!
Portsman:
There's a lot a person can understand about another from first impressions alone.
Edgeworth:
(I can't say I disagree with him on that point...)
Gumshoe:
Wh-Why don't you say something, sir!? ...*gasp!* N-Not you, too, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(Despite his lack of attention to detail, I don't believe the detective to be the culprit. Nobody could've overlooked the bloody letters, and I can prove it... With evidence.)
Portsman:
I couldn't ask for a better set-up... ...for the game-finishing spike!

Edgeworth:
Are you saying that those letters were intended for you?
Portsman:
Yup. Jim was an outstanding detective. I would expect no less from my former partner.
Edgeworth:

Portsman:
What are you sputtering over there? Can't you just admit my logic is perfectly sound?
Edgeworth:
(Actually, there's a gigantic flaw in his logic... A gap so wide that even the good Detective can spot it. Now to clue Mr. Portsman in by presenting him with some evidence.)
Edgeworth:
Perhaps you're not aware Mr. Portsman, but there is a serious flaw in your logic.
Portsman:
Heh, bringing a bit of the courtroom into this, I see. No problem, I'm game!
Edgeworth:
I can't help but find it odd...
Portsman:
Excuse me?
Edgeworth:
Odd that a fellow prosecutor would be brought down by the power of his own office.
Portsman:
Wh-What are you talking about!? ...Oh, you're joking, I get it...! Ha ha ha.
Edgeworth:
If you have the time to laugh, then you have the time to take another, closer look at this. Do you still not see? If not, may I direct your attention to the missing file...
Portsman:
Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? That's impossible!!
Edgeworth:
What's "impossible", Mr. Portsman?
Portsman:
Um, uh, nothing...
Edgeworth:
The files on that shelf are all about a certain case. When the killer went to take the file after murdering your partner... ...I highly doubt they could've missed the bloody letters written on the spines.
Portsman:
Objection!
Portsman:
It's possible that they could have taken the file before committing the murder!
Edgeworth:
I think it's pretty obvious that the file was stolen after it was written on. The missing letters in the detective's name where the file should be is proof.
Gumshoe:
Yeah! I mean, the "s" is gone, and there's only half an "h"!
Edgeworth:
If Detective Gumshoe really was the culprit of this case... ...I highly doubt that even he could overlook his own name written in blood on the files. Especially as a detective who can't stand the sight of blood!
Portsman:
*gasp!*
Gumshoe:
Which means... what exactly? What does that make this dying message...?
Edgeworth:
It makes it the work of a criminal intent on tampering with the crime scene.
Portsman:
............
Gumshoe:
That's so low! I can't believe the criminal tried to pin this whole thing on me, sir! I'm gonna get 'em, sir! You'll see! I'm gonna have them under arrest in no time!
Edgeworth:
Well, Mr. Portsman?
Portsman:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Brilliant! Absolutely splendid! Logic deserving of Olympic gold!
Edgeworth:
I appreciate the praise, but it doesn't change the fact that your reasoning is flawed.
Portsman:
Meh, you win some and you lose some. That's how life goes.
Gumshoe:
Glad everyone's so cheery... even though I feel more dead than alive.
Portsman:
Ah, but you know, it really is a shame... I really didn't want to have to bring this up, however...
Gumshoe:
W-What is it this time!? Are you still after me, pal!?
Portsman:
Humor me for a second. Who has the key to this office?
Gumshoe:
That would be me! But Mr. Edgeworth just proved that I'm innocent, pal!
Portsman:
That's absolutely right! And I acknowledge your innocence.
Edgeworth:
Then why do I sense that you still have something to say?
Portsman:
Well, I was thinking. Did you know there is one other person with a key to this office?
Edgeworth:
(One other person...?)
Portsman:
Hey, you there!
Officer:
Yes, sir! What is it, sir!?
Portsman:
Would you kindly fetch and escort that lovely young lady here for me...?
Edgeworth:
(A lady...?)
Portsman:
The girl is a member of this building's security. Think of her as a "material witness".
Gumshoe:
S-Security!? Did you say, "Security"!? No, stop it, pal! Don't!
Edgeworth:
(What's wrong with him all of a sudden?)
Portsman:
I believe she needs no introduction. I have called upon Ms. Maggey Byrde, a member of security.
Byrde:
D-Detective Gumshoe, sir...
Gumshoe:
Maggey!
Portsman:
Ms. Byrde is the security guard on watch tonight.
Edgeworth:
I see. And your point is?
Portsman:
My point is that she could very well have used it. And by "it", I mean the master key, which can open all the office doors in this building.
Gumshoe:
Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Portsman:
If you are not the guilty party, Detective Gumshoe... ...then the only other person with access to this room is Ms. Byrde.
Byrde:
How dare you!? I would never sneak into someone's room!
Gumshoe:
That's right! I refuse to believe that Maggey's the culprit, pal! Um... It was me! That's right, I did it!
Portsman:
Can we take that as a confession, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Um, well, it wasn't really me... But it definitely wasn't Maggey, pal! So, yeah, it was me! If it was, you'd have no problems with that, right!?
Edgeworth:
Please refrain from flying off the handle, Detective. There's no need for such theatrics.
Portsman:
Listen to your boss, Detective. He understands what I'm saying here. That girl is the only one who could've committed the crime, and for one simple reason!
Argument
-- Reason for Suspicion --
Portsman:
It's pretty obvious that Ms. Byrde snuck into your room using the master key.I mean, if Detective Gumshoe isn't the one who opened the door......then that leaves only Ms. Byrde as our prime suspect.On top of which, she knows our good detective, doesn't she?Making it all that more probable that she was the one who faked the dying message.
Edgeworth:
So you're saying that she used the master key...
Master Key data jotted down in my Organizer.
Portsman:
Incredibly incriminating evidence, wouldn't you say?
Examine evidence
Master Key
Key
Edgeworth:
It's the master key to every office in the building.
Edgeworth:
That's what you claimed about the evidence earlier as well...
Portsman:
That was then, this is now. The flow of a good match always changes during a rally. It's all about your reflexes and reaction time, especially for an athlete like me!
Edgeworth:
(I wonder if there was anyone else other than Ms. Byrde who could've used the master key? It seems that the only way to get Mr. Portsman to give me more details is to Press him.)
Rebuttal
-- Reason for Suspicion --
Portsman:
It's pretty obvious that Ms. Byrde snuck into your room using the master key.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you sure Ms. Byrde is the only member of security who could've used the master key?
Portsman:
There's only one person on staff at this time of night. And tonight, she's it. Isn't that right, Ms. Byrde?
Byrde:
That's, um... true... But... But I wasn't able to use the master key at the time of the crime, sir!
Edgeworth:
("Wasn't able to"...? What's that supposed to mean?)
Portsman:
Yes, yes... Moving on. I'd hate to get sidetracked by something unrelated.
Gumshoe:
Whaddaya mean, "unrelated"!? I wanna hear what she has to say, pal!
Portsman:
But you can't really trust her not to tell lies. Plus, I hate wasting time.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, should I hear Ms. Byrde out...?)
Ask for more details
Edgeworth:
Not so fast. I, too, am interested in hearing what Ms. Byrde has to say.
Portsman:
Didn't I just say it'd be a waste of time? We don't need to hear her lies.
Edgeworth:
I'll be the judge of that. Ms. Byrde, if you please.
Byrde:
I discovered that the master key was missing at around 1 AM, sir!
Edgeworth:
What do you mean by "missing"?
Byrde:
As in "it wasn't anywhere in the security booth", sir! The killer must've stolen it!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Portsman, I believe this to be an important piece of testimony. Don't you?
Portsman:
*sigh* I can't believe that someone like you would be taken in by such words.
Byrde:
I'm not lying, sir!
Portsman:
Objection!
Portsman:
If that's the case, then I'd like to know... why you have the master key now?
Byrde:
I... I don't quite know. It just reappeared all of a sudden, sir.
Portsman:
Hah, a likely story. And where is your proof that the key was stolen to begin with? I bet you just forgot where you put it and then "found" it again.
Byrde:
I never lose things! I can practically guarantee that! With me, if something disappears, it's usually because someone stole it!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal! Trust me, you don't want to test just how bad her luck is!
Edgeworth:
.........Unfortunately, I can't deem this piece of testimony as conclusive.
Portsman:
Glad you agree, Mr. Edgeworth.
Gumshoe:
Unnnngh... But! But! You still haven't established Maggey's motive for breaking into Mr. Edgeworth's office!
Portsman:
Her motive? Didn't we already establish that it was theft? I mean, the culprit clearly went through the bookshelves and at least tried the safe.
Edgeworth:
It is as Mr. Portsman says, Detective. (I can't ignore the fact that all the evidence points towards a motive of theft. But I'm done taking blows. It's time to counterattack with a few facts of my own.)
Adds statement "Her intent? From the messed-up shelves to the wiped-down safe, I'd say thievery."
No details necessary
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, maybe I should pay more attention to what Mr. Portsman is saying for now.)
Leads back to rebuttal
Press (after adding statement)
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you sure Ms. Byrde is the only member of security who could've used the master key?

Byrde:
That's, um... true... But... But I wasn't able to use the master key at the time of the crime, sir!

Objection!
Portsman:
Hah, a likely story. And where is your proof that the key was stolen to begin with? I bet you just forgot where you put it and then "found" it again.
Gumshoe:
What do you know, pal!? Besides, Maggey doesn't have any reason to want to sneak into Mr. Edgeworth's office!
Portsman:
You mean her motive? Didn't we already establish that it was theft? I mean, the culprit clearly went through the bookshelves and at least tried the safe.
Edgeworth:
It is as Mr. Portsman says, Detective. (I can't ignore the fact that all the evidence points towards a motive of theft. But I'm done taking blows. It's time to counterattack with a few facts of my own.)
Portsman:
Her intent? From the messed-up shelves to the wiped-down safe, I'd say thievery.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I concur that the culprit's motive appears to have been thievery, however...
Portsman:
Glad to hear that the great Miles Edgeworth is in agreement with little ol' me.
Edgeworth:
However, with regard to the investigation of the bookshelves and safe...
Portsman:
Hey! Good thinking, asking for my opinion on the matter!
Edgeworth:
.........Would it be too much for you to allow me to complete a full sentence?
Present Secret Safe
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Do you wish to continue insisting that Ms. Byrde was set on stealing something?"
Portsman:
I mean, if Detective Gumshoe isn't the one who opened the door...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I thought we had established Detective Gumshoe's innocence pretty thoroughly.
Portsman:
It was just a theory, one hypothesis among the many possibilities. I mean, I had my doubts about Ms. Byrde from the very beginning.
Edgeworth:
If that's the case, then why didn't you mention her first?
Portsman:
Now, now. Don't make that face. See! There goes the truth, running the other way! Let's pick up the pace and see if we can't catch up to it!
Edgeworth:
I don't think you're catching my drift...
Portsman:
Ah, but we are in agreement that the detective isn't the killer, right? If so, then I hope you'll understand when I say... ...that since she is the only one who could've open [sic] your office door...
Portsman:
...then that leaves only Ms. Byrde as our prime suspect.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Don't you think it's a bit early to be jumping to conclusions?
Portsman:
Are you saying there's another way to open the door other than with the master key? Oh, I get it. Perhaps you had a spare made for someone else?
Edgeworth:
I'll have you know, I have never made a spare, so what are you insinuating?
Portsman:
Nothing. Guess I should've known better than to suggest that someone like you would.
Portsman:
On top of which, she knows our good detective, doesn't she?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Is there anyone in this district who hasn't at least heard of Detective Gumshoe?
Portsman:
Good point. He's practically a celebrity among us prosecutors.
Gumshoe:
Really!? I never knew I was so talked about, sir!
Portsman:
We're holding our collective breath, you know. For when you screw up so badly that you're literally chased off the force.
Gumshoe:
W-Wait, WHAT!? IS THAT TRUE, MR. EDGEWORTH!?
Edgeworth:
......... O-Of course not. T-That's hogwash!
Gumshoe:
Phew... Don't scare me like that! I almost had a heart attack there...
Portsman:
Making it all that more probable that she was the one who faked the dying message.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
By "dying message", you mean the bloody letters that spell out "Gumshoe"...?
Portsman:
I figured that whoever wrote his name must have wanted to frame him. And just the act of choosing his name is proof enough that the two knew each other well.
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! What are you waiting for! Hurry up and present some evidence!
Edgeworth:
I would love to... But first, we should listen a bit more, and digest what he is saying. (And Press him for more information.)
Edgeworth:
Do you wish to continue insisting that Ms. Byrde was set on stealing something?
Portsman:
Why not? It's the truth, after all. It was also by your logic that we came to the whole thievery conclusion anyway.
Edgeworth:
That may be, but you must also be aware of the fact that the safe is a secret safe. The existence of which is only privy to prosecutors...
Portsman:
Ah!
Edgeworth:
I find it a little hard to believe that a hidden safe was a part of her cunning plan.
Portsman:
B-But...! But she could've found it by accident while she was turning everything else upside-down!
Edgeworth:
I highly doubt that. I'd say the culprit knew exactly what they were looking for. After all, only the bookshelf and the safe were targeted.
Portsman:
Nnnnghaaaaaargh!
Gumshoe:
Yeah! Even I didn't know about that safe, pal! And that means there's no way Maggey could've known about it either!
Portsman:
Th-Then are you proposing... ...that the killer is a prosecutor...?
Edgeworth:
Interesting conclusion. That's definitely looking more and more probable.
Portsman:
............
Edgeworth:
What's wrong, Prosecutor? Do you have a different suspect in mind now?
Portsman:
I... I... Curses! Why!? What made you--!?
Gumshoe:
Wh-What's with the angry face all of a sudden...?
Portsman:
It's... It's all my fault...!
Edgeworth:
What do you mean?
Portsman:
It's Jim... He knew... about the existence of the secret safes.
Edgeworth:
! What did you just say...!?
Portsman:
We were partners! Like inseparable conjoined twins! That's why I told him. I filled him in on the secret safes.
Gumshoe:
Then that means...
Portsman:
Yeah, I know. I had only just told him, too... Obviously, it was wrong of me to tell him... I still can't quite believe it, but the thief who broke into your room was probably Jim...
Edgeworth:
(Now he's claiming that the victim was the thief...?)
Portsman:
And... you were simply trying to stop him, weren't you? Ms. Maggey Byrde...
Byrde:
Excuse me?
Edgeworth:
.........!
Portsman:
I mean, you ARE a security guard, right? That's your job. But, killing is going a bit too far, even in your risky profession.
Gumshoe:
What the--!? You're still accusing Maggey of the murder!?
Portsman:
Yes and no. I mean, she had stumbled upon Jim, who had probably drawn his gun... I get it! It was self defense, wasn't it!?
Byrde:
N-No! I... I couldn't... I could never do something like that, not even as a security guard, sir!
Gumshoe:
Plus, even if he was the thief, he wouldn't have a key to this office!
Portsman:
Which is precisely why he had to steal it, wouldn't you say? It was Jim who stole the master key.
Byrde:
Aaah!
Portsman:
Pretty impossible for a supposedly "stolen" key to be here with us, unless... ...well, unless you retrieved it from Jim after you killed him.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Portsman, are you honestly accusing your own partner of being a thief?
Portsman:
I don't want to admit it, but it's the only way for everything else to make sense.
Edgeworth:
(Has he no honor!?)
Portsman:
Now then, I think we're done here. The investigation waits for no man. Would you people be so kind as to see yourselves out?
Gumshoe:
You can't kick us out! This is Mr. Edgeworth's office!
Portsman:
Ah, but I'm the one who's been assigned to this case. You are all suspects to varying degrees, and therefore, ineligible to run this show.
Edgeworth:
.........
Gumshoe:
Listen, pal! How many times do I have to say this!? Maggey CAN'T be the culprit!!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe! Calm yourself.
Gumshoe:
B-But, sir...
Edgeworth:
We have no choice but to accommodate his request... for now.
Portsman:
Ha ha! Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. At least ONE of you understands. Now, then, if you could remove yourselves from my crime scene, I'd be most grateful.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Mark my words, Mr. Portsman. We will meet again.
Portsman:
If that's a formal request from the legendary prosecutor himself, then I suppose so. Now don't disappoint me, you hear!?
To be continued.

Gumshoe:
What is with that prosecutor!? I can't believe how rude he was! It was... unbelievable!
Edgeworth:
Please maintain your professionalism, Detective.
Gumshoe:
I'm gonna find some real solid evidence proving Maggey's innocence! You'll see, sir!
Byrde:
But we've been kicked out of the crime scene, sir!
Gumshoe:
T-True... So then, what now!?
Byrde:
Looks like my life's fallen into yet another gigantic ditch.
Edgeworth:
Do not despair, Ms. Byrde. We can overcome this as well. There are many other places and things we should be looking into anyway.
Gumshoe:
Eh!? Really, sir!?
Edgeworth:
For example, this hallway. The lynchpin of his argument against Ms. Byrde is related to the master key. In that case, this hallway is the perfect place to look for more information... ...regarding the mystery surrounding my door.
Begin InvestigationProsecutor's Building
12th Floor Hallway
Examine
Maggey Byrde
Edgeworth:
I was wondering if I may speak with you for a bit concerning this case.
Byrde:
I've always been a big fan of the courtroom, but this... ...this is like a dream! A dream where I'm being cross-examined by THE Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(I can't let this chance pass me by. I must remember to ask her about the master key. I should jog her memory by showing my notes to her through the Present Button.)
Talk
The victim
Edgeworth:
Have you ever met the victim before?
Byrde:
Well, I've seen him a couple of times before when I had to go to Mr. Portsman's office. Mr. Faith was always playing basketball with Mr. Portsman, sir.
Gumshoe:
That sounds like fun! Just once, I'd have loved to play with them.
Byrde:
It sounds like fun, but the only person ever taking a shot was Mr. Portsman... All Mr. Faith ever did was pass him the ball, sir...
Gumshoe:
...On second thought, I don't think I'd have fit in all that well with them.
Maggey Byrde
Edgeworth:
Ms. Maggey Byrde, correct? I take it that you are an acquaintance of the detective?
Gumshoe:
She was under my supervision back when she was still on the force, sir. One day, she got caught up in a murder, and things started going downhill, so she quit.
Byrde:
But I owe a lot to Detective Gumshoe for introducing me to my current employer! Or so I thought until a few hours ago... Right before I was about to clock out for the night...
Edgeworth:
...You got caught up in this whirlwind of a case, correct?
Byrde:
Don't worry. My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures.
Edgeworth:
...?
Byrde:
Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... And now, I even managed to be named a criminal, just when I've become a security guard.
Edgeworth:
That's... a lot to go through in one lifetime...
Byrde:
I know! And just when I thought I had finally found my happiness... ...I wind up getting you and Detective Gumshoe involved in my bad luck.
Edgeworth:
You don't need to worry about me, Ms. Byrde. Nor do you need to worry about yourself. I will solve this case and prove your innocence. All I ask in return is for your cooperation.
Byrde:
Yes, sir, Mr. Edgeworth! You can count on me! I'll do all I can to help!
Used the master key? (appears after presenting Master Key)
Edgeworth:
What did you mean by you "used the master key"?
Byrde:
Oh, I had to use it to open the door for this prosecutor who had forgotten his key. I mean, it's my job as a security guard, right? .........Ah!
Edgeworth:
What is it?
Byrde:
That's right! I just remembered! The prosecutor who forgot his key... It was Mr. Portsman, sir!
Edgeworth:
What!? Please tell me more, Ms. Byrde. Quickly!
Forgetful Mr. Portsman (appears after "Used the master key?")
Byrde:
It was around 12 AM. Mr. Portsman had forgotten his office key, so he came down to security, sir.
Edgeworth:
And that's when you loaned the master key to him?
Byrde:
No way! It's against regulations to loan the master key out to anyone! I walked with Mr. Portsman to his office and opened the door for him personally, sir.
Edgeworth:
(I see...)
Gumshoe:
And then? What happened after that!?
Byrde:
Well, he called for me to come close up his office as he was leaving to go home. That was around 1:30 AM, I think.
Edgeworth:
So, in summary, for the sake of one forgetful prosecutor... ...you used the master key twice (Used the master key – This key was used to unlock and lock Portsman's office at 12 AM and 1:30 AM.) tonight.
Gumshoe:
Talk about suspicious!!
Edgeworth:
I doubt you can say that you've never left your keys at home, Detective... (I think this calls for a thorough examination of Mr. Portsman's door.)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Byrde:
That's a Prosecutor's Badge, isn't it? It proves that you're really a prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
(Interesting... Despite all appearances, she seems to know more than Gumshoe.)
Byrde:
With that badge, even I could be a professional prosecutor... Sir, may I please try that on? Just for a little bit!?
Edgeworth:
I don't think that would be a very good idea, do you?
Byrde:
I-I guess not...
Edgeworth:
(On second thought, they're actually on the same level...)
Master Key
Edgeworth:
So when did you discover that the master key was missing?
Byrde:
By the time I realized it, I think it was around 1 AM, sir. And I noticed it was back at around 2:30 AM. It was just sitting there on the ledge where the security room's reception window is. But I'm sure that between those two times it was not just gone, but stolen (Master key was stolen – This key went missing from approximately 1 AM until 2:30 AM.), sir!
Edgeworth:
Why is such an important key stored in such an insecure place?
Byrde:
Ah, it's not like that, sir. We always keep the key further inside the room, away from the window.
Edgeworth:
Always, you say? Except for this time, correct?
Byrde:
Well, I admit that was a bit careless, but I had my reasons! I left it out because I was sorta using it at the time. It was after I had used it that I left it sitting out on the ledge.
Edgeworth:
(She used the master key?)
Portsman's Office Door
Byrde:
I've had to open Mr. Portsman's office up for him a number of times before. I've also had the chance to see the inside of his office on a number of occasions, too. He's got shelves upon shelves of sports memorabilia, trophies, and awards in it... ...to the point where it's almost beyond gaudy, sir. ...But maybe I just feel that way because I'm jealous since I don't have even a single one.
Gumshoe:
Don't say that, Maggey! I... I'll make a special "Guard of the Month" award, just for you!
Byrde:
...Thanks for trying, but I've already got a mountain of consolation prizes, sir. They're proof of just how unbelievably unlucky my life has been. Plus, getting an award from you just isn't the same as getting a real award, sir!
Gumshoe:
N...Nnnnnnnnngh!
Anything else
Byrde:
I'm just a lowly security guard, so... ...I'm not sure what I should do with that other than to guard it!
Edgeworth:
(*sigh* It's like talking to another Gumshoe.)
Prosecutor
Prosecutor:
It looks like you're in quite the pinch, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
To be sure, a murder within the walls of the prosecutor's office is no trifling matter. We must find, apprehend, and punish the killer accordingly post-haste.
Prosecutor:
Sounds like a messy case you've got on your hands. If you ever feel lost, or need some advice, my door is always open!
Edgeworth:
How gracious. I will keep your offer in mind. (...Who is this guy again?)
Officer
Edgeworth:
Is everything alright?
Officer:
Yes, sir! If you must know, I weighed myself this morning, and I'm finally at 154 pounds!
Edgeworth:
...Congratulations, but I was asking about this hallway and this room.
Officer:
Oh! Everything's OK, sir!
Edgeworth:
A word of advice. Stay focused, or you may start to lose even more weight.
Sofa
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
File
Edgeworth:
...? It's...
Gumshoe:
Ah! isn't this that missing 0-series file, sir!?
Edgeworth:
No doubt about it. The bloody letters mark it clear as day. ...There seem to be a few pages missing. Our thief took only what was necessary, and left the rest behind.
Gumshoe:
So what are these 0 files about, sir? I guess they've got something worth stealing in them, huh.
Edgeworth:
Not particularly. It's just a collection of court case files. However... ...the cases within these files are not mine.
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
They belonged to the high prosecutor that used to occupy my current office. I have my reasons, but let's just say I was charged with keeping them as they were.
Gumshoe:
Then that means the thief must've also wanted the file for a specific reason, right?
Edgeworth:
It would seem so. Only the pages related to that case from 10 years ago are missing.
Gumshoe:
I wonder why anyone would care about such an old case?
File (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
It's the stolen file... But what's it doing under here?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and why would you steal something and then leave it behind?
Edgeworth:
It looks like our thief took only what was needed.
Gumshoe:
So what are these 0 files anyway?
Edgeworth:
(Didn't I just explain that a few minutes ago?)
Gumshoe:
I guess they've got something worth stealing in them, huh.
Edgeworth:
Not particularly. It's just a collection of court case files. However... ...the cases within these files are not mine.
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
They belonged to the high prosecutor that used to occupy my current office. I have my reasons, but let's just say I was charged with keeping them as they were.
Gumshoe:
Then that means the thief must've also wanted the file for a specific reason, right?
Edgeworth:
It would seem so. Only the pages related to that case from 10 years ago are missing.
Gumshoe:
I wonder why anyone would care about such an old case?
Cushions
Edgeworth:
A well-crafted, high-quality sofa for visitors. The stitching is excellent.
Gumshoe:
Talk about a luxury waiting area. These babies are also great for napping, you know!
Edgeworth:
You would sleep even out here, Detective? In a hallway?
Gumshoe:
Whenever I do, I always wind up dreaming about giving testimony up on the stand. But it always ends the same way: me getting trounced by a lawyer! Isn't that awful!?
Edgeworth:
(Maybe I should give it a try sometime... To envision myself winning, naturally.)
Space under sofa
Edgeworth:
I bet the thief's... not under here...
Gumshoe:
I guess there isn't enough space for anyone to hide under here anyway. I mean, if someone could contort themselves to fit, I'd be REALLY impressed!
Edgeworth:
(Sounds to me like somebody has already tried at least once before...)
Sofa (subsequent times, after examining file)
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Left office door
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Door
Edgeworth:
A minimalist, yet classy door made of top-quality wood. It's sturdily made, making it near impossible to break in by force.
Gumshoe:
It's almost... majestic, sir. I wish I could be as stately as this door.
Edgeworth:
(Only Gumshoe would praise a door as something greater than himself...) Being a detective has its own rewards, and a certain virtuous value... I think. If you live up to your full potential... that's a poignant trait that anyone can admire.
Gumshoe:
I see! So you're saying, sir, that me being me is the best thing I can do for everyone?
Edgeworth:
............Right.
Gumshoe:
...That long pause wasn't exactly reassuring, sir.
Number plate
Edgeworth:
1202. These four numbers on a number plate alone proclaim this to be my office.
Gumshoe:
Whoops! ...Hey! These number plates slide right out, sir!
Edgeworth:
They have to be able to take the plate off when a room becomes vacant, you know. Although... the idea that it can be so easily removed is kind of...
Doorknob
Edgeworth:
I don't see any signs of forced entry.
Gumshoe:
And according to the guard, no signs that the lock was picked, either, sir.
Edgeworth:
Meaning that the door really was opened with a key. Hmm... Did you happen to ask if any prints were lifted from the doorknob?
Gumshoe:
Apparently, the doorknob's clean as a whistle. Wiped, they think.
Edgeworth:
(Whoever this thief is, they did a good job of not leaving any clues behind.)
Left office door (subsequent times, after examining doorknob on door)
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Basketball
Edgeworth:
What is a basketball doing here...?
Gumshoe:
That's Mr. Portsman's prized possession, sir. I heard he also plays soccer, dodge ball [sic], and even tennis.
Edgeworth:
And not a single one of those sports is suitable to be played in a hallway.
Right office door
Edgeworth:
This office...
Gumshoe:
Um... 1203... 1203... Hey Maggey, whose room is this again?
Byrde:
...It's Mr. Portsman's, sir.
Edgeworth:
So he's my new neighbor, I see... I suppose he moved in while I was away overseas?
Right office door (after clearing "Forgetful Mr. Portsman" Talk option with Maggey Byrde)
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Examine
Door
Edgeworth:
A minimalist, yet classy door made of top-quality wood.
Gumshoe:
It's kinda majestic, too! Fits in really well with the ambiance of the prosecutor's offices! Even Mr. Portsman seems dignified, just because he works behind one of these.
Edgeworth:
Nonsense. A man doesn't become more or less dignified because of where he works.
Gumshoe:
Well, he still seems more dignified than Mr. Payne.
Edgeworth:
(Mr. Payne...? I suppose custodial work can also be dignified.)
Number plate
Edgeworth:
Room 1203. I take it that this is Mr. Portsman's office?
Byrde:
Yeah, you can't mistake it because of that basketball hoop, sir. Oh, that reminds me. Mr. Portsman had actually wanted room 1202 really badly. But since you were already occupying it, Mr. Edgeworth, we put him next door, sir.
Edgeworth:
So why was Mr. Portsman so particular about getting room 1202?
Byrde:
I'm not sure, but I bet it's because of something like his birthday is December 2nd...?
Gumshoe:
Yup! That's gotta be it! I can't think of another reason why!
Edgeworth:
(I can think of at least three... Bah. Why am I even wasting time thinking about this?)
Doorknob
Edgeworth:
The door is locked tight.
Gumshoe:
Heh heh, I bet the ol' credit card trick wouldn't work here, huh Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
This is the office of a high prosecutor, Detective. These doors would be pretty ineffective if the average cat burglar could get through them.
Gumshoe:
Aha! So I guess only a GREAT cat burglar could get in! That must be who our culprit is!
Edgeworth:
...Might I advise you to return that conclusion to whatever pawn shop you bought it from?
Basketball hoop
Gumshoe:
It's Mr. Portsman's personal basketball hoop.
Edgeworth:
I can't believe he put something like this in the hallway of a Prosecutor's Office.
Gumshoe:
But, you know, it's actually pretty useful, sir! I haven't gotten lost trying to get to your office since it's been here!
Edgeworth:
(How long have I had the same office, and yet you STILL managed to get lost!?)
Deduce doorknob (after examining doorknob of door and connecting "Master key was stolen" and "Used the master key" Logic)
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Present Mr. Portsman's Office
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"There's a contradiction here between reality and the evidence."
Any other deduction
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
This location contradicts this piece of evidence!
Gumshoe:
Hmm? I don't see anything wrong at all, sir...
Byrde:
Detective Gumshoe! You should think a little harder, sir! ...Although I don't really get it myself, either.
Edgeworth:
I-I see... In that case, I'll point out what's wrong once more for the two of you. (I sense that if I look a little harder, I'll find the contradiction slumbering here. I should probably also flip through my Organizer one more time...)
Leads back to examination of right office door
Edgeworth:
There's a contradiction here between reality and the evidence. If what Ms. Byrde has said is true, then why is this door locked tight?
Gumshoe:
Huh? You know, you're right!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Byrde, are you sure you didn't re-lock this door?
Byrde:
I am certain of it, sir. And I don't think Mr. Portsman noticed it himself that I hadn't...
Gumshoe:
Which means... what, sir?
Edgeworth:
It either means that he actually DOES have the key to his office... ...or that the door Ms. Byrde opened wasn't this one at all, but a completely different one.
Gumshoe:
She opened a different door? But how can you prove that?
Edgeworth:
There's an easy way to find out. All we need to do is... ...we need to examine these:
Prints on the master key
Edgeworth:
If we examine the fingerprints on the master key...
Gumshoe:
Well, if that's what you want to examine, sir, that was the very first thing we did. I can tell you that we didn't find any prints other than Maggey's.
Edgeworth:
.........
Byrde:
That's so brilliant, Mr. Edgeworth! So what can we deduce from that?
Edgeworth:
Ah, well...
Byrde:
I'll tell you what I deduced! I think this means that the culprit wiped their prints off!
Edgeworth:
............Y-Yes, that's exactly it. I'm glad you were able to come to the same conclusion. However, the more important matter is... 
Leads back to:
"...we need to examine these:"
Prints on the doorknob
Leads to:
"The prints on the doorknob will tell us everything!"
Prints on the number plate
Edgeworth:
The prints on the number plate, they will tell us all that we need to know.
Byrde:
Everything? Really? ...Like what, sir?
Edgeworth:
Like... Well, for example... And such as... Well, we know for sure that Detective Gumshoe's dinner will only consist of instant noodles!
Gumshoe:
Woooooow!!! That was amazing, sir! How did you know!?
Byrde:
Was that supposed to be a joke to cheer me up, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes, that's it. Now then, we should get back to doing what we need to do and that is...
Leads back to:
"...we need to examine these:"
Edgeworth:
The prints on the doorknob will tell us everything!
Gumshoe:
Hey, you! Yeah, you, pal! Do us a favor and see what you can lift from this, OK!?
Gumshoe:
So!? What did you find out!?
Edgeworth:
There's no need for such belligerent nostril flaring, Detective.
Forensics:
Sir! I have found only Mr. Portsman's and Mr. Faith's prints on this doorknob.
Edgeworth:
So only two people's prints were found on this, huh? That's pretty decisive...
Gumshoe:
Huh? I'm lost, sir.
Edgeworth:
Thinking logically, a certain other person's prints should be on this knob as well. (Now then, whose prints should also be on this doorknob?)
Present Maggey Byrde profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Don't you find it odd that the prints of the person who unlocked this door are absent?"
Present Buddy Faith or Jacques Portsman profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Gumshoe:
............
Byrde:
............
Gumshoe:
Um, we already found Mr. Portsman's and Mr. Faith's prints, sir...
Edgeworth:
...Urngk! I-Is that so... W-Well, there should be one other person who left their mark on this.
Leads back to:
"Now then, whose prints should also be on this doorknob?"
Present Dick Gumshoe profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Gumshoe:
And why would my prints be on this knob, sir?
Byrde:
Are you saying that Mr. Gumshoe has broken into Mr. Portsman's office before!?
Gumshoe:
Wh-What!? I've never even been inside that office! What are you saying, sir!?
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes, well... ...I was just testing your naïveté. I'll answer you straight from now on.
Gumshoe:
I wish you had done that from the very beginning, sir.
Edgeworth:
Um, sorry.
Leads back to:
"Now then, whose prints should also be on this doorknob?"
Edgeworth:
Don't you find it odd that the prints of the person who unlocked this door are absent?
Gumshoe:
You mean...?
Edgeworth:
Yes, the door that Ms. Byrde opened could not have been this one, but a different one.

Basketball
Edgeworth:
Is this basketball property of Mr. Portsman?
Byrde:
Yes, sir! He's always ready for a match!
Gumshoe:
Basketball, soccer, dodge ball [sic], tennis... It doesn't matter what sport it is, he's game. Although, I think it'd be a little hard to play tennis with this ball. Ho ho.
Edgeworth:
That isn't the point you should be focusing on, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Y-You're right, sir! Now I know what I should be focusing on! Bad Mr. Portsman! Someone should teach him to clean his toys up after he's done playing!
Edgeworth:
...I think we've reached the end of this conversation.
Lower part of basketball hoop
Edgeworth:
(Hm? What's this...?)
Gumshoe:
What are you looking at, sir? Oh, hey! How about a game?
Edgeworth:
That's OK, Detective... I just found the position of this hoop to be a little off.
Gumshoe:
Hey, you're right, sir! I guess it shifted when someone made a seriously sweet slam dunk!
Edgeworth:
(The positioning of the hoop is definitely unnatural... I'd better take note of this.)

Slip of paper
Edgeworth:
What is this?
Gumshoe:
Looks like a scrap of paper. I'll get it, sir! Let's see... Oh, there's something written on it!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It looks like a note from the victim.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and it's for Mr. Portsman.

Edgeworth:

Basketball hoop
Edgeworth:
What is a basketball hoop doing here...?
Gumshoe:
Hey, didn't this used to be just outside next to the building a long time ago?
Edgeworth:
So when and why was it moved indoors...?
Gumshoe:
I don't remember exactly, but I saw one of the officers drag it up here recently.
Edgeworth:
...Drag it!?
Gumshoe:
I heard that it wouldn't fit in the elevator, so the poor guy had to bring it himself.
Edgeworth:
(...All the way up to the 12th floor?)
Logic
Connect "Master key was stolen" and "Used the master key"
Edgeworth:
Ms. Byrde... I'm afraid there's a flaw in your story.
Byrde:
What!? No way, pal! I mean, sir!
Edgeworth:
You said that you locked up Mr. Portsman's office at around 1:30 AM, correct? However, the master key had already been stolen at that time.
Byrde:
Woooow... Nothing gets by you, Mr. Edgeworth! You saw that contradiction like a pro! I had totally forgot all about that! But thanks to you, I remember it now! You're right! It was around that very time that I realized the master key was missing.
Edgeworth:
And...?
Byrde:
Well, I'm a security guard, sir! I couldn't just admit to losing the master key, could I? So I... I pretended to lock up his room... sir.
Edgeworth:
You "pretended"?
Byrde:
Yeah, I used my house key and made it look like I was locking up, sir.
Edgeworth:
So in actuality, you never did re-lock the door, then.
Byrde:
Well, I thought that maybe I could go lock it after I found the key... Come to think of it, I guess the door still hasn't been locked properly...
Mr. Portsman's Office data jotted down in my Organizer.
Partner
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Talk
Anything of interest?
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. You look rather intrigued by something. Care to share?
Gumshoe:
Aw, it's nothing... but I noticed that Mr. Portsman calls his partner "Jim". And the detective in that Sunday night drama, "All My Cops", is named Jim, too! I bet one of them is a big fan of that show.
Edgeworth:
You seem to know a little something about it yourself. I take it you watch it, too.
Gumshoe:
Of course! The tight bond of friendship between prosecutor and detective is great, sir! But it's nothing compared to the super strong friendship we have, ho ho ho.
Edgeworth:
"Friendship", Detective? I think you're mistaking it with "pity".
Gumshoe:
H-How can you say that, sir!? And after all we've been through, too... *sniffle*
Talking to witnesses
Edgeworth:
About Ms. Byrde...
Gumshoe:
No way she's the killer! Please don't tell me you buy into that accusation, sir!
Edgeworth:
Rest assured I think she's innocent. However, I need to ask her a few things regarding her security guard position.
Gumshoe:
Well, if you're only asking, that's OK. Just stand next to her and then touch the Talk Button. Then you two can talk about whatever topic you pick. When you want to ask her about evidence, all you have to do is Present it. After you choose what to show her, touch "Present" again, and off you two go! I recommend showing different people different things. You'd be surprised by what they say!
Edgeworth:
Thank you for the explanation, though I don't recall asking for one.
Gumshoe:
Oh, just so you know, sir, you can show ME evidence in the same way, too!
Edgeworth:
I do believe it's time to get down to business and ask some questions of Ms. Byrde.
Gumshoe:
Ignored again... *sniffle*
Ace Investigator (appears after examining file under sofa and clearing "The Victim" Talk option with Maggey Byrde)
Edgeworth:
I was wondering about the investigation...
Gumshoe:
Oh, I've been waiting for this! Let a real, seasoned pro teach you how it's done!
Edgeworth:
(A real seasoned pro? Of instant noodle cuisine, perhaps.)
Gumshoe:
You know that you can always check out the really important spots in more detail, right?
Edgeworth:
... Yes...
Gumshoe:
And if the area is too big, you can always use the Arrow Buttons at the bottom, right? Oh, but don't worry, sir. The Arrows only show up when you need to use them to see more.
Edgeworth:
I knew that as well.
Gumshoe:
AND! When you think there's a contradiction or something unusual, try Deduction! First, you line up your cursor with the suspicious-looking area. Then touch "Deduce" and choose your poison, I mean, evidence. When you've settled on a piece, you've gotta Present it!
Edgeworth:
I'm pretty sure I already knew that as well, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Well, if you can remember all that, then welcome to the world of pros! I dub you, "Ace Investigator"! Class dismissed!
Edgeworth:
(And all I wanted was an update about the investigation...)
Present
Basketball Hoop
Gumshoe:
Hey, I love basketball! I play all the time when I'm off duty!
Edgeworth:
...Interesting.
Gumshoe:
You should see me dribbling, faking, and weaving like a pro with my trusty coat on, sir! They call me the "Green Supernova"!
Edgeworth:

After examining file under sofa, doorknob of left office door, lower part of basketball hoop, and slip of paper under right office door:
Investigation Complete
Edgeworth:
Poking around in this hallway has actually paid off quite handsomely.
Gumshoe:
Huh...? H-How so, sir!?
Edgeworth:
In a variety of different ways... I think it's time we had a little chat... ...with the real culprit of this case.
Byrde:
Y-You know who the real killer is!? Wow, Mr. Edgeworth!!
Edgeworth:
As long as my logic is sound, then yes... The mastermind behind this murder is none other than Mr. Portsman.
Byrde:
Whaaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Portsman!?
Gumshoe:
I knew it! That's exactly what my logic senses were telling me, too! I suspected it was him from the instant he accused Maggey of being the killer, sir!
Edgeworth:
(That is anything but logical.) Lady and gentleman. Prepare yourselves. Come what may, it's time to knock on Truth's Door.

Mr. Portsman! I've finished processing the bloody letters, sir!
Portsman:
Alright! Let me take a gander at it! Pass it here! OK, looking good! You there! Take good care of this!
Gumshoe:
Gwwwwoooooooooooooooaaar!!!
Portsman:
Well, if it isn't Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
End of the line for you, Portsman. We've got you now!
Portsman:
Call off your dog, Mr. Edgeworth. Is this some kind of joke?
Edgeworth:
It's no joke. We know, Mr. Jacques Portsman, that you are the guilty party in this case.
Portsman:
...! You must be pretty upset, getting chased out of your own room. I'd be mad, too. So I guess you can stay... If you promise to stay out of our way.
Edgeworth:
You intend to hide your crime under the guise of a prosecutor doing his job? Hmph, I can see right through the unsightly, paper-thin mask you wear upon your cowl.
Portsman:
Ha ha. Who'd have ever thought it would come to this? Actually, come to think of it, your mentor was Manfred von Karma, right?
Edgeworth:
!
Portsman:
The legendary prosecutor who never lost a single case for 40 long years. But there was always this... incessant chatter about forged evidence with that guy.
Edgeworth:
............
Portsman:
Really teaches me that I've got to stay on the lookout for false accusations, you know?
Edgeworth:
Are you done trying to play mind games with me, because they won't work. The only thing you should be using that mouth of yours for now is explaining yourself. Although that, too, will only dig your hole deeper. Either way, your game is up.
Portsman:
Well, aren't we full of ourselves? Even though you have yet to prove anything.

Look, I feel bad doing this to you, but I've got work to do, so we're done here.
Edgeworth:
Sorry, but we are not finished, yet.

Edgeworth:
Oh? And what, pray tell, kind of evidence are we talking about here?

Jim was my partner, so you can't say I had a motive for killing him!
Edgeworth:
And...? That's it? That's not even an anthill, let alone a mountain.
Portsman:
But it's more than enough, wouldn't you agree?
Edgeworth:
...Might I recommend that you review what the word "evidence" means.
Portsman:
It doesn't change the fact that the evidence doesn't point to me as the killer.
Portsman:
Besides, how, may I ask, do you propose I unlocked your door and got in here?

You claim to have had no way to open my door, however, is that really the honest truth?

So? Where's your proof? The saying, "Evidence is everything" isn't limited to just the courtroom, you know.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. You need not remind me. I'll show you all the evidence you want in time.
Edgeworth:
I believe you were able to open my office door. With the master key, no less.
Portsman:
Objection!
Portsman:
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on for a sec. I never laid a finger on that key, as you already know.
Edgeworth:
Precisely. You were able to open my door without lifting a single finger. Well, maybe you did, but only to direct.

Edgeworth:
You had asked Ms. Byrde to open your own office door for you, yes?
Portsman:
Yeah, I kind of forgot my key at home. Happens a bit too often for my taste, you know?
Edgeworth:
But the room you had Ms. Byrde open at that time was not your own, was it?
Portsman:
!
Byrde:
Wh-What!?
Portsman:
You have quite the imagination. But why don't we ask the girl herself whose door she opened, shall we?
Byrde:
Um... I'm certain that it was Mr. Portsman's door, sir. I checked the number plate to make sure I was opening the right door, sir!
Portsman:
See, Ms. Byrde backs up my story.
Edgeworth:
Yet, what if you had mislead her, to fool her into thinking what you wanted?
Portsman:
Hah! And how do you suppose I did that!?
Edgeworth:
By switching the number plates on our doors, for example.
Byrde:
That's right! They do slide out pretty easily!
Edgeworth:
Furthermore, you then used one other thing to give a very strong impression... ...that the door she was opening was yours and not, in fact, mine. (What was it that Mr. Portsman used to make Ms. Byrde think that it was his room?)

Even I wouldn't get tricked by something like that, sir.
Edgeworth:
I-I suppose not...
Gumshoe:
Was Maggey really mislead, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I believe so, and Mr. Portsman used this to give her the wrong impression!
Leads back to:
"What was it that Mr. Portsman used to make Ms. Byrde think that it was his room?"
Byrde:
What!? The basketball hoop, sir!?
Edgeworth:
It's quite the peculiar fixture in any hallway, let alone a hallway in this building. Which is why it left an unusually strong impression on you. It's an object perfectly suited to sit just outside the office of a peculiar prosecutor.
Portsman:
Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Byrde:
That's very true, sir! Because there was a basketball hoop sitting there... ...I thought the door I was opening had to be Mr. Portsman's!
Edgeworth:
There are signs that the hoop has been moved. To sit it in front of my office, to be sure.
Portsman:
I...I see. So that's how you throw suspicion on people. Thanks for the tip. But I think your conjecture is a little off the race track.

Objection!
Portsman:
It's all circumstantial! No judge would convict on such flimsy evidence!
Edgeworth:
(He seems to be trembling a little... One more little push... All I have to do is find the flaw in his testimony!)
Edgeworth:
That, was a lie.
Portsman:
Wh-What are you talking about!? How was that a lie!?
Edgeworth:
This is a note that the victim left for you, Mr. Portsman.
Portsman:
A note?
Edgeworth:
It was left under your door. Or did you not notice? And right here, it says, "but you're out."
Portsman:
............
Edgeworth:
You were not in your room when the victim came to call on you. So then, where were you and what were you doing?
Portsman:
Aaaaaaaaah!
Edgeworth:
Shall I explain it in full detail for you? You were busy snooping around in my room, the very room you had Ms. Byrde open for you!
Portsman:
Objection!
Portsman:
Th-That's just nonsense! You have no evidence that I made the girl open your door for me!
Edgeworth:
Oh, but I do. I have very decisive evidence!
Portsman:
N-No way!!
Edgeworth
This is proof positive that you had Ms. Byrde open the door for you!
Present Mr. Portsman's Office
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I had your door dusted for prints."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Portsman:
I think you need to take a good look at this piece of evidence!
Portsman:
You know... Nope, I've got nothing. Getting sleepy, are we? I guess it is getting kind of late.
Edgeworth:
Argh! I'll have you know I'm wide awake! And I'll prove it to you!
Leads back to:
"This is proof positive that you had Ms. Byrde open the door for you!"
Edgeworth:
I had your door dusted for prints.
Portsman:
My door? Hah, what for? Come on, I bet you didn't find anything. You sure are good at wasting time.
Edgeworth:
You're right. I didn't find anything, and definitely not Ms. Byrde's fingerprints.
Portsman:
Her prints? What do they have to do with anything?
Edgeworth:
Let's put it this way. If she really was the one who opened your door... ...then her prints should naturally be on the doorknob she touched!
Portsman:
Aaaack!
Edgeworth:
Further, all of the prints on my office door's knob have been wiped clean off. I can only assume it's because Ms. Byrde's fingerprints were on it. Don't you think it's time you gave up your charade? We know you stole into my office with the intent of stealing something from me. And Detective Faith found you out. Possibly because he heard sounds coming from a room whose occupant was on leave. Mr. Portsman, you killed Mr. Faith to silence him. And I had the misfortune to return when I did; you had to threaten me as you escaped.
Portsman:
............
Edgeworth:
As I said when you had the gun to my back... ...no one gets away with committing murder in my office.
Portsman:
.........Heh heh. Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh...
Edgeworth:
.........!
Portsman:
Haaaaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Gumshoe:
And just what's so funny, pal!?
Portsman:
Well, that look of stiff seriousness on the face of this office's finest prosecutor... ...as he makes a huge mistake in accusing me is simply too much to bear. There's just nothing else like it in the world!
Edgeworth:
What!?
Byrde:
Mr. Edgeworth just explained it all, and he even backed it up! You're the murderer! Stop trying to be slippery and just admit to the crime already!
Portsman:
And as I said earlier, it's all so circumstantial, so full of conjecture. You say you checked my doorknob for prints? Well, I can readily confess that I had wiped that knob down well.
Byrde:
Eh?
Portsman:
I'm a little obsessive-compulsive, you see. I didn't want to touch a doorknob that you had touched. Which is why I wiped the knob down as soon as I could after you opened the door. After that, it makes perfect sense that only Jim's and my own prints would be on there.
Gumshoe:
You! You made that up just now, didn't you!?
Portsman:
Furthermore, as for the note Jim left for me, do you know exactly when that was? For all we know, he could've left it there before I arrived at the office. Like, early evening, for example.
Edgeworth:
Are you saying you failed to notice a note in your doorway?
Portsman:
Hey, even geniuses fail at times. I was probably too preoccupied by work-related matters, although that's no excuse.
Byrde:
Now that's just a flat-out lie! There's no way you didn't notice a note that size!
Portsman:
Ah, but you can't prove that, can you?
Edgeworth:
............
Byrde:
Say something, Mr. Edgeworth! Back me up here, sir!
Edgeworth:
(Nngh... Portsman makes a good point. I can't prove that he didn't simply overlook it.)
Portsman:
Besides, I have an airtight alibi.
Edgeworth:
Airtight, you say?
Portsman:
I only realized that I had one just now as we were talking. I guess it would've been better for all of us if I had told you sooner!
Argument
-- Portsman's Alibi --
Portsman:
If memory serves, you came back to this office at around 2 AM, correct?
And it was then that you had that unfortunate confrontation at gunpoint with the culprit.
But at exactly that time, I was down in Criminal Affairs!
Ask around. I'm sure the other detectives will corroborate my story. It's the perfect alibi!
Edgeworth:
Do you really think it's that perfect!?
Portsman:
Like I said, I don't care. Ask around all you like! You'll see for yourself.
Edgeworth:
......... Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Sir, yes, sir! I'll go check out his alibi, sir! Be right back!
Gumshoe:
M-Mr. Edgeworth, sir! I think we're in trouble! It's just like Mr. Portsman said! The guys down in Criminal Affairs said they saw him at around 2 AM!
Portsman:
You see?
Edgeworth:
............ (All of the evidence points to him being the culprit. So there must be a contradictory point in his alibi somewhere!)

Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
You are correct; it was around 2 AM...
Portsman:
Are you sure? It's really important to me that you're spot on with the time.
Edgeworth:
I remember checking my watch then, and make no mistake, it was 2.
Portsman:
Ooh! Giving testimony like a pro! OK, so you came back to your office at 2...
Portsman:
And it was then that you had that unfortunate confrontation at gunpoint with the culprit.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
It is as you say, however...
Portsman:
Yes, however, you are the only one who claims to have bumped into the culprit. So tell me, did you see the person's face? Was it me who you saw?
Edgeworth:
...It was pitch black, so I couldn't actually see.
Portsman:
Objection!
Portsman:
Oh, come now. I'm sure you saw something! Try a little harder why don't you?
Edgeworth:
(I'm beginning to feel like I'M the one being interrogated here...)
Portsman:
Oh well, it doesn't matter if you remember or not. It only matters that you ran into the culprit.
Portsman:
But at exactly that time, I was down in Criminal Affairs!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you paid the Criminal Affairs Department a visit...
Portsman:
Yup! Right after I left the Prosecutors' Building, I headed straight for the precinct.
Portsman:
Ask around. I'm sure the other detectives will corroborate my story. It's the perfect alibi!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Hmm, well, we did go and ask around to confirm your testimony.
Portsman:
And it was just as I said, right?
Gumshoe:
...Yes, sir. A number of detectives said that they saw you at around that time.
Portsman:
See! I have the perfect alibi! That's the ace I had up my sleeve.
Edgeworth:
(Argh...!)
Edgeworth:
(Portsman's alibi may seem perfect at first glance... ...but I know there's a hole in it somewhere. All I need to do is "Press" him a little and see what comes of it.)
After pressing all statements:
Edgeworth:
(Impossible! He actually DOES have the perfect alibi!)
Portsman:
What's wrong? Why the sudden sullen look on your face?
Gumshoe:
Can't you say anything back, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Portsman:
Heh, I think we've reached the end of the line and it's time to get off this crazy train. You there!
Officer:
Sir!
Portsman:
Please escort the young lady out. But remember, be gentle.
Gumshoe:
M-Maggey!!
Byrde:
Detective Gumshoe!!
Edgeworth:
(Is there... nothing I can do? There must be a way to turn this situation around! If I only had a clue... Did I miss something that can help me cast doubt on his alibi (Mr Portsman's alibi – The intruder I met could not have been Portsman. Then who could it have been?)? I need to calmly think this through one more time, and with Logic!)
Logic
Connect "Files in disarray" and "Mr. Portsman's alibi"
Edgeworth:
Evidence points to the shelves being disturbed once before and once after the murder. But who is to say that the person who did it the second time is the same as the first? 
Leads to:
"Which could mean..."
Connect "Mr. Portsman's alibi" and "Another handgun"
Edgeworth:
There were two bullets left at the scene of the crime. One that robbed Mr. Faith of his life... ...and one that nearly robbed me of my jacket. However, the murder weapon only shows signs of being fired once. Meaning that it is entirely possible... ...that a second gun was used in my office tonight. But, seeing as how the killer had to steal Mr. Faith's gun... ...I doubt the killer had another gun up their sleeve. Therefore... ...the second gun could've been the property of an entirely different person.
Leads to:
"Which could mean..."
Edgeworth:
Which could mean... ...that there was another person (Another visitor – Maybe the victim and his killer weren't the only visitors to my office tonight.) who paid a visit to my office tonight.
Logic
Connect "Another handgun" and "Another visitor"
Edgeworth:
If, indeed, there were two culprits... ...then that resolves the contradiction behind our murder weapon. Despite the fact that there are two bullets here in this room... ...the murder weapon only shows signs of being fired once. Leaving the possibility that the other bullet was fired from the other visitor's gun. Furthermore...
Leads to:
"If we suppose that the second culprit's gun was the one that was pointed at my back..."
Connect "Files in disarray" and "Another visitor"
Edgeworth:
Supposing that there was yet another visitor tonight... ...that would also resolve the issue of why my shelves were upended twice. We know that the shelves were disturbed once before and once after the murder... ...so it shouldn't be much of a stretch to think that it was the work of two different people. Once by the person who stole the victim's gun and then killed him with it... ...and once again after the murder by our second culprit... ...who was the owner of the second gun.
Leads to:
"If we suppose that the second culprit's gun was the one that was pointed at my back..."
Edgeworth:
If we suppose that the second culprit's gun was the one that was pointed at my back...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Portsman. It seems that I need to amend my assumptions regarding this case.
Portsman:
Great! So you've finally come to your senses.
Byrde:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Gumshoe:
Sir! What are you saying!?
Edgeworth:
This has been a big misunderstanding on my part from the start. I had assumed that the person I ran into was the killer, but that may not be the case.
Portsman:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
The person I ran into was just your average thief.
Gumshoe:
A thief...? But, sir doesn't that cause some sort of contradiction in the facts?
Edgeworth:
Not at all. It simply means that the killer was someone else. And it means that in actuality, two culprits stole into my office tonight!
Gumshoe:
Wh-What do you mean TWO!?
Edgeworth:
It explains both why my shelves were disturbed twice and how there were two guns. Mr. Portsman tricked Ms. Byrde and gained entry into my office.
Portsman:
Objection!
Portsman:
Now you're just leading the argument. You still don't have any actual proof, you know!
Edgeworth:
If you could please go along with my hypothetical scenario for now, Mr. Portsman. In the end, if you really are innocent, you should have nothing to worry about.
Portsman:
Grr...!
Edgeworth:
Now then, returning to my scenario, Mr. Portsman was out to steal something from me... ...which is why he checked my secret safe and ransacked my shelves. This is the first time.
Gumshoe:
So then... this would be when the files were put back in the wrong order, right?
Edgeworth:
Correct. And then, just when he was about to look somewhere else... ...who should walk in but his own partner, Mr. Faith.
Gumshoe:
But why did Mr. Faith come into your room, sir?
Edgeworth:
He probably had business with Mr. Portsman, which is why he was in the area. But that's when he noticed sounds coming from my office would be my guess.
Byrde:
Oh! Because you were supposed to be away, right!?
Gumshoe:
And he must've thought it was odd, so he came into this office to check it out!
Edgeworth:
Correct. And as a detective, that was the right thing to do.
Byrde:
But when he came in, he found his own partner standing there...
Edgeworth:
Because it was Mr. Portsman, Mr. Faith probably let his guard down. But Mr. Portsman was not so merciful as to let him leave alive. He waited for a chance and stole Mr. Faith's gun from him, and then...! He killed him. He silenced Mr. Faith for catching him in the act of stealing.
Portsman:
..................
Edgeworth:
This was the moment in which the first shot was fired, the one that landed in my files. Following that, Mr. Portsman wiped the gun down and left it behind as he made his exit. He could afford to do that because he had also left the fake dying message behind.
Gumshoe:
You're such a complicated troublemaker, you know that!?
Edgeworth:
Well, if things were as simple as that, then all would be solved. However... ...there was yet another visitor to my room, and this is where it gets complicated.
Portsman:
There was another...?
Gumshoe:
...Visitor, sir?
Edgeworth:
Yes, and this other person's objective was also to steal something from me. Now then, even after Mr. Portsman left, the door to my office remained unlocked. However, this new visitor had no way of knowing that, and so... ...they stole the master key from the security guard's room... ...and then entered my room and searched through my shelves. This was the second time they were disturbed, and it seems the thief found their prize.
Gumshoe:
The stolen 0 file, right, sir!?
Edgeworth:
Correct. Only, just as the thief was about to leave with the file, I appeared. The thief then threatened me with their own gun, and made their escape. The second bullet was fired during that brief encounter.
Gumshoe:
So the shelves getting messed up twice and the two bullets... It was all because two different people were doing those things at two different times!
Edgeworth:
Precisely. So now do you see, Mr. Portsman? The person I met was just a thief, and was not, in fact, Mr. Faith's killer! Your alibi for the time frame in which I ran into the other person is now irrelevant... ...because we now know that the murder took place during the first culprit's visit!
Portsman:
Objection!
Portsman:
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Gumshoe:
What's so funny, pal!?
Portsman:
Absolutely splendid! Your scenario explains everything!
Gumshoe:
Of course it does! It's Mr. Edgeworth, after all!
Portsman:
But you know, it still doesn't change the fact that it's all circumstantial.
Edgeworth:
!
Portsman:
Supposing if, and that's a big "if", your theory is right... ...it would indeed render my alibi, which has withstood scrutiny, mind you, irrelevant. But there is still one defining point of your argument for which you have no evidence. Your supposition that I was the "first visitor".
Gumshoe:
Grrrrrrr! Mr. Edgeworth! You can't let him get away with that, sir!
Edgeworth:
.........But he has a point. I have absolutely no proof at this point.
Byrde:
Don't say that, sir...
Gumshoe:
I-I don't believe this! Don't worry Maggey, I'll do something if I must!
Portsman:
You know something? I find your attitude to be somewhat peculiar, Mr. Edgeworth. If the person you met really was just a plain ol' thief... ...then why is that person not your main suspect? That is, if your theory is correct.
Argument
-- Portsman's Alibi, Pt. 2 --
Portsman:
That thief you ran into should be your real suspect, wouldn't you say?
We should be out there looking for that thief right now. They might still be nearby.
I hate to repeat myself, but as I've already said, I was training in my room.
And when Jim came to deliver some evidence to me, I was down at Criminal Affairs.
So I can't be expected to know what happened around here after I left.
Edgeworth:
So you think we should be out there looking for the thief?
Portsman:
Of course! Now isn't the time to be wasting time on dead-end discussions!
Edgeworth:
I don't think it's at all "dead-ended". I find your alibi to be fascinating. Let's continue where we left off, shall we?
Portsman:

Edgeworth:
Actually, no, I wouldn't.
Portsman:
Wh-Why not?
Edgeworth:
That's elementary. The dying message, of course. Mr. Faith's killer very clearly left those letters on the spines of those files... And it was after they were on there that the thief stole one of them.
Gumshoe:
You mean the 0 files, right!?
Edgeworth:
And that's how we also know the letters themselves were a set-up, and not from Mr. Faith. If the thief was the killer, do you think they would try to undermine themselves?
Portsman:
Aaaah! Err, maybe the killer just didn't think of that either? Yes, that must be it! Maybe, just maybe...
Portsman:
We should be out there looking for that thief right now. They might still be nearby.

Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Once escaped, I highly doubt a thief would linger nearby.

Well, you never know. Maybe they didn't get what they were really after.

Ah, it's nothing like that! I have no idea about anything. After all...

Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
But according to Mr. Faith's note...
Portsman:
Hold on, I thought we already cleared that up. Didn't we say that Jim left that note for me in the early evening? If you have proof that he left it at a different time, say, just before he was murdered...
Edgeworth:
...I don't have any, no.
Portsman:
You see! So I insist again that I was in my office the entire time...
Portsman:
And when Jim came to deliver some evidence to me, I was down at Criminal Affairs.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Why didn't you go there with Ji... Mr. Faith?
Portsman:
Ah, that's because he said he was tired and was going to take a quick nap. You know those sofas in the hallway? He likes to sleep on those. It's one of his habits.
Edgeworth:
And what of the evidence he brought?
Portsman:
They were related to yesterday's case. Just two items: a gun and a pendant.
Edgeworth:
(...Interesting. This piece of testimony seems too crucial to let slip through the cracks.)

Edgeworth:
A gun and a pendant...?
Portsman:
Yes, this gun, which was the murder weapon... ...and this pendant, which belonged to the victim.
Edgeworth:
And why were you taking them to Criminal Affairs?
Portsman:
There was something in a past case file I wanted to compare these two to. But all this has nothing to do with this case right now. Anyway, I believe you'll find the long paper trail I left to be to your satisfaction.

Present Note Left by Victim

I can't expect you to know, can I?
Portsman:
Nope. But I guess you can expect me to take a guess based on logical deductions.
Edgeworth:
Oh? Then let's see you deduce.
Portsman:
Jim waited for me to leave, and then stole the master key. For the purpose of sneaking into your room, of course. And that's when Ms. Byrde caught him red-handed... and the murder occurred. It's all exactly as I had laid out earlier.
Edgeworth:
(I know he's lying. I know he was here, at the scene of the crime. I just have to find a way to prove it.)
Edgeworth:
Only two pieces? I believe the proper phrase here is, "you fail."
Portsman:
E-Excuse me?
Edgeworth:
You fail as a prosecutor, Mr. Portsman, as you intend to keep evidence hidden from me.
Portsman:
What are you talking about? I-I haven't hidden anything from you...
Edgeworth:
Well, here's a piece I think you should read. Carefully.
Byrde:
Ah! It says that Mr. Faith was bringing three pieces!
Edgeworth:
Yes, and this is the victim's real dying message to you, Mr. Portsman.
Portsman:
He...! I can't believe...! To get tripped up by simple arithmetic...!
Edgeworth:
Where is the missing piece of evidence!?
Portsman:
...I... It's...
Edgeworth:
You have it, don't you? Only the guilty would make such a face. Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
You don't have to say it, sir! I'll pat the guy down from head to toe!
Portsman:
Wh--! Don't come any closer! I'm warning you!
Gumshoe:
This is all part of the investigation, PAL, so don't even think about stopping me!
Portsman:
Noooooooooooooooo!!!
Gumshoe:
Hey! What's this!? He had this on him, sir!
Edgeworth:
Despite what you said, it would appear that you do have something to hide.
Gumshoe:
But why would he hide something like that!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. There's only one reason why anyone would hide evidence of this caliber. Because it would unequivocally point to that person himself as the real killer.
Portsman:
.........Nnngh...
Edgeworth:
Let's examine this video tape in a little more detail! For the section of the tape that will drive the last nail into his coffin!

Gumshoe:

Edgeworth:
Interesting... However, what's recorded on this isn't what's important right now. Let's give the casing a thorough once over.
Gumshoe:
Ah! That's blood, isn't it!?
Edgeworth:
Yes, and I believe this is what the "good prosecutor" was trying to hide from us! This blood is still fresh.
Gumshoe:
You mean, this might be Detective Faith's blood!?
Portsman:
...N-N-N-N-No! No! You've got it all wrong!
Edgeworth:
Hmph, no amount of denial can save you. We have but to run a blood test to find the truth.
Portsman:
Nnngh...
Edgeworth:
You told us that you had received evidence from the victim earlier. Now you will tell us when and how did the victim's blood find its way onto this video.
Byrde:
Yeah! It's totally suspicious!
Edgeworth:
Was it at the moment of his death!? Did Detective Faith have this video tape on his personage when you killed him!?
Portsman:
You know very well there's no way to prove that!
Edgeworth:
Not even if we were to examine this tape for fingerprints?
Portsman:
Gnaagh!
Edgeworth:
If I had to take a guess... ...I'd say that the only ones on here would belong to the murderous you, and Mr. Faith!

Gumshoe:
Mr. Portsman has been placed under arrest for the murder of Detective Buddy Faith, sir!
Edgeworth:
Very good.
Gumshoe:
And the results we got back from the lab techs on the tape turned out to be real solid, sir! The bloodwork came back, and it was definitely Mr. Faith's blood on there. And as a bonus, they were also able to lift a few of Mr. Faith's fingerprints as well!
Byrde:
Thank you so very much, Mr. Edgeworth! I still can't believe I got to see your cool deduction skills outside the courtroom! I'm impressed beyond words, sir!
Edgeworth:
It was nothing. I'm just sorry you got caught up in a murder in my office. Please accept my apologies.
Byrde:
Aww, it was nothing. Really. Compared to what I've been through, I mean! I consider myself lucky that it was only a burglary and a murder this time, sir! If it had been a hold-up, or a hostage situation, I'd have thrown my hands up in the air. I think I'm finally rising up from a "Goddess of Misfortune" to just an "Unlucky Person"!
Edgeworth:
(Something tells me we should have hired a different person for security detail...)
Gumshoe:
You know something, sir? That Mr. Portsman really was one corrupt prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
And why would you say he was "corrupt"?
Gumshoe:
Well, I heard that there were a number of suspicious things related to his court cases. There's even rumors about how some of the evidence he uses is forged, sir.
Edgeworth:
(Forged evidence, huh...)
Gumshoe:
And they say he even decided not to prosecute a few cases for some really vague reasons.
Byrde:
Oooh! That guy was a complete disgrace to the entire profession!
Edgeworth:
We never did get around to asking what his reason was for breaking into my office.
Gumshoe:
Yeah... Whenever we got near that topic, he just clammed up.
Edgeworth:
(Although, we can be pretty certain that it was to steal something.)
Gumshoe:
This is just between you and me, sir, but... ...there's a rumor that some sort of huge organization is involved behind the scenes.
Edgeworth:
Oh? Well, well...
Edgeworth:
With Mr. Portsman not willing to divulge anything, it certainly lends credence to that rumor. ...It would seem that we haven't heard the last of this.
Gumshoe:
Huh!? Then Mr. Portsman isn't the bad guy!?
Edgeworth:
I didn't say that. But rather, that there are still many more mysteries for us to solve. For example, we still haven't figured out the significance to this piece of evidence...
Present Stolen 0-Series File
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The person who stole this file... the other villain of the night..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Gumshoe:
Um, sir... I don't think there's any mystery left to that piece...
Edgeworth:
You... might be right there...
Gumshoe:
I think you've solved the case already, Mr. Edgeworth. The only thing left that we still don't know about is maybe this.
Edgeworth:
Yes, the 0-series file. The significance of which we have yet to fully comprehend.
Leads to:
"The person who stole this file... the other villain of the night..."
Edgeworth:
The person who stole this file... the other villain of the night...
Gumshoe:
...Yeah, I wonder who it was?
Edgeworth:
And what happened to the stolen pages? (I wonder... Who in the world was it that held me up at gunpoint?)
Forensics:
Mr. Edgeworth, sir!
Edgeworth:
Yes?
Forensics:
I came across this while I was processing your office earlier, sir.
Edgeworth:
This card--!
Gumshoe:
What is it, sir? Is that a bird or something on there?
Edgeworth:
It's not just any bird... It is the mark of the raven. A three-legged raven. Even you should know what this is, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Oh! It's about that thing, isn't it? That Great Thief everyone's talking about!?
Edgeworth:
Yes, it is the mark of the Great Thief "Yatagarasu"! Under the mark of a legendary bird, the Yatagarasu is noble to the end, a modern Robin Hood. Labeled "mysterious" and "phantom-like", the Yatagarasu appears and vanishes at will. Though we don't know much about this thief's ultimate goal, we do know the targets. The Yatagarasu likes to find and make public, evidence of corrupt dealings of all sorts. The theft is always performed in silence and always with perfection. Once a target is chosen, no dramatic calling card or announcement is sent forth. Instead, the chosen corporation is infiltrated without even the target noticing. Some days later, the evidence that was found is sent out to the mass media... ...along with this single card. Although, it has been a while since the Yatagarasu's last appearance...
Gumshoe:
Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! Look, something's written on the back!
Edgeworth:
What? Let me see!
Gumshoe:
It's the location of where the thief put the stolen files!
Edgeworth:
(So the person who stole the contents of the file was the Yatagarasu...?)
Edgeworth:
"Yatagarasu". "Organization". Quite a few key words are popping up in this mystery. The murder in my office... The return of the Great Thief "Yatagarasu"... Looking back, I can't say I didn't see these events coming... ...for they were heralded by the incidents that began to occur two days ago.
THE END
Nothing to examine
Edgeworth:
There's nothing of interest here.
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right...)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.)
Too many penalties (before Jacques Portsman arrives)
Edgeworth:
(Tsk... Where has the time gone...?)
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! You must be really worn out from your trip. Are you jet-lagged? You really should go home and take it easy, sir! Remember, a man's gotta have his health!
Edgeworth:
I understand... However, I can't allow this case to go unsolved.
Gumshoe:
Nope! You shouldn't push it, sir! Leave it to me! I'll get to the bottom of it! I promise!
Edgeworth:
But... But...
Edgeworth:
A few days passed, and as I suspected, the case went unsolved. Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Too many penalties (after Jacques Portsman arrives, but before first argument)
Portsman:
Looks like even the mighty "Genius Prosecutor" is no match for me!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What are you...!?
Portsman:
I have already figured out who the real culprit behind this caper is!
Edgeworth:
...!
Portsman:
Sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to get out of my crime scene, Mr. Edgeworth. ...No offense or anything, but you're cramping my game.
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Presenting wrong evidence during argument
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I must object to your line of logic!
Portsman:
And which part do you have an objection to?
Edgeworth:
...It's... Yes, well...
Gumshoe:
Stay cool, Mr. Edgeworth! You're no good when you're all flustered.
Portsman:
The detective's right, for a change!
Edgeworth:
(H-How did it come to this!? Calm down, Miles. Listen carefully and think everything through a bit more rationally.)
Presenting wrong evidence during argument
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
It would behoove you to take a good look at this.
Portsman:
I see it, but I fail to see how it has anything to do with me.
Edgeworth:
I-Is that so...?
Portsman:
You're not at the top of your game today, are you, Mr. Genius Prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
(I can't allow him to set the pace here. I must remain calm. Only by doing so can I find the fatal flaw in his reasoning!)
Presenting wrong evidence during argument
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Portsman. There is a large flaw in your logic...
Portsman:
Really? I think it holds up rather well, actually. What do you think is wrong with it?
Edgeworth:
Ack! Um, nothing. Let's move on.
Gumshoe:
This isn't like you at all, sir! Concentrate!
Edgeworth:
(That was careless of me. I can't afford to do that or the truth will slowly slip away. Remain calm, Miles! It's the only way!)
Too many penalties (during rebuttal segment "Mr. Portsman's Logic")
Portsman:
Unfortunately, your faulty logic was only able to carry you so far. And now I'm afraid I have to place Detective Gumshoe under arrest.
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Please do something! Get me out of this!!
Edgeworth:
(Argh! Is this the best I can do...?)
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Too many penalties (during rebuttal segments "Reason for Suspicion", "Mr. Portsman's Rebuttal", or "Conjecture's Rebuttal")
Portsman:
So, how about it? By now, even you must see that the girl is clearly the culprit. You hear that, Jim! I finally got the one that did you in!
Edgeworth:
H-Hold on there!
Portsman:
Save your breath. There's no one left to listen to your inane ramblings.
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Too many penalties (in hallway)
Gumshoe:
You! What are you doing here!? ...Sir.
Portsman:
I've come to announce that the investigation is over. And that the girl is under arrest. Game, set, and match.
Byrde:
Mr. Edgeworth! Please, help me, sir!!
Edgeworth:
(Nnrgh! Is there nothing I can do!?)
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Too many penalties (during or after rebuttal segment "Portsman's Alibi")
Portsman:
I know you'd love to pin this on me, but swing and a miss, Edgeworth. Swing and a miss.
Edgeworth:
E-Excuse me...?
Portsman:
Look, I have an alibi. If you have evidence to the contrary, I'd sure like to see it.
Edgeworth:
(There must be a way for me to squash Portsman's alibi...)
Portsman:
In the meantime, I'm taking the girl with no alibi into custody, thank you very much.
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
