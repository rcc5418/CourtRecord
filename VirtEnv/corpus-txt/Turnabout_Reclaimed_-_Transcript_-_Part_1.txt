Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright... ...head of the Wright Anything Agency, and a lawyer. Although, I was doing something else entirely for a while there. As for why I decided to formally get back into lawyering... ...let's just say there's unfinished business to take care of. Anyway, I thought I'd reminisce about my first case back on the job. And what a case it was! It happened only a few months after Athena joined our office...

Whale:
*Fweet!*
Female pirate:
Cap'n Orla! Ye made it just in time!
Orla:
*Fweet fwe fwe fwe fwe fweet!*
Female pirate:
Oh we be pirates. We love to sail the seven seas.
Just a bunch o' scallywags who are as free as free can be.
We swim through storms and waves, all because, you see...
Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me!
Crowd:
YEAH!!!
July 20, 12:37 AM [sic] 
Wright Anything Agency
Phoenix:
(Today is my first day back on the job as a lawyer. Putting this attorney's badge on again really makes it hit home. Boy am I pumped! Even Trucy said, "Looking good, Daddy!") So Athena, Apollo, what do you think of the ol' attorney's badge?
Athena:
Wow! This Shipshape Aquarium's show is great! I can't get enough of it!
Phoenix:
Um... Athena?
Athena:
I still can't believe they showed the Swashbuckler Spectacular on TV! Good thing I recorded this! ...Now, who's ready for another viewing!
Apollo:
You've already watched it five times! Let's watch something else now!
Athena:
How can you even suggest such a thing?! This show is therapeutic!
Phoenix:
(Uh, boss here, asking you guys a question...)
Apollo:
What's so "therapeutic" about watching a killer whale?
Athena:
What?! Don't you know anything?! Animal-assisted therapy is an established psychiatric treatment!
Apollo:
You're kidding. That kind of thing really exists?
Athena:
It's a real thing! I've been to the aquarium myself to try it, and it really helps. I still go to there every now and then to further my psychology studies. The last time I went, I saw a dolphin and an orca swimming around together! It was so--
Phoenix:
Hey, do you two think you could quit goofing off and do some work for a change?
Apollo:
Work? But we've already cleaned the toilet... Twice. Each. ...Hey, wait a minute. Is that your badge I see?
Athena:
Wow! Congrats on getting your attorney's badge back, Boss!
Phoenix:
Thanks. Starting today, I'm officially a lawyer again! (Sheesh. Took 'em long enough to notice...)
Apollo:
Gee, Mr. Wright... With that badge on, you suddenly look so... capable!
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. Um, thanks? (It's not like I was some lazy bum, you know!)
Apollo:
But what made you suddenly so fired up to get your badge back, anyway?
Phoenix:
Ah, well... I made a promise to a certain someone... An important promise.
Apollo:
What could be so important...?
Phoenix:
Anyway, we have three lawyers now, so we'd better start taking on lots of work!
Athena:
I'm all for that! Let's get this agency hoppin'!
Phoenix:
(Well, we have plenty of enthusiasm. All we need now are some clients... It's been eight years since I last wore this badge. I feel like a rookie all over again.)
TV:
...And this just in... The owner of Shipshape Aquarium, "Captain" Jack Shipley... ...has been murdered. The suspect in the case is reportedly already in custody inside the aquarium.
Apollo:
Isn't that the aquarium we were just watching, Athena?!
Athena:
It is! ...I can't believe it! A murder at Shipshape Aquarium...?! But I love that place! We need to get to the bottom of this!
???:
R-Really? I guess I'm in luck, then! I need Phoenix Wright to save my friend!
Phoenix:
(Wh-Who in the world is this?!) Um... are you a client...?
Athena:
Wait... That costume... It looks just like... I've got it! You must work at Shipshape Aquarium!
Buckler:
That's right! You min-now it! I'm Sasha Buckler! I perform like an agile catfish in our pirate show! It'll blowfish your mind!
Phoenix:
("Minnow"? "Blowfish"? Those puns floundered a bit...)
Athena:
Hee hee! I figured out the client's identity! Chalk one up for analytical psychology!
Buckler:
My friend is under suspicion of murder, so I really need some help. That's why I've gotta find this "Phoenix Wright" guy...
Phoenix:
Well, I'm Phoenix Wright... And this is Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes. They're lawyers, too.
Apollo:
If there's anything you need, all you have to do is ask!
Athena:
The same goes for me too, Ms. Buckler!
Buckler:
Ha ha! Just call me "Sasha." And I'll call you all by your first names, too, if that's all right. Phoenix, Apollo, Athena, you have to help me! Please save my friend!
Phoenix:
(Guess we'd better start by asking her more about her defense request.)
Talk
Your defense request
Phoenix:
Ms. Buckler-- Sasha, could you tell us more about why you need our help?
Buckler:
My friend is suspected of murdering the captain of Shipshape Aquarium.
Phoenix:
"Captain"? I thought the victim was the owner of the aquarium?
Buckler:
Yeah, well, our aquarium has a pirate ship theme. That's why we call the owner our "captain." We call the employees "crew," too.
Phoenix:
That's a pretty unusual aquarium you've got there.
Buckler:
Anyway, one of the crew members, my friend, is being suspected of the captain's murder. They've already decided she's guilty. I think they're going to give her the death penalty!
Phoenix:
Wh-What?! (What happened to "due process"!?)
Buckler:
But my friend is as sweet and gentle as a whale shark! She wouldn't hurt a guppy! I know there's no way she murdered anyone, but they won't believe me! But with a name like "Wright," I figured you'd be able to help me set them straight!
Apollo:
Wait a minute... Don't tell me she picked you all because of a bad pun...
Phoenix:
Ouch. I see my reputation doesn't precede me... (But seriously. My name can't be the real reason she's here...)
Adds talk option:
"Why request me?"
Why request me?
Phoenix:
What's the real reason you picked me, Sasha?
Buckler:
...Well, to be honest, I asked a whole slew of lawyers, but they all refused. They said stuff like, "There's no merit to taking your case," or "I'm not sure I can help." They're all as cruel as sharks, with hearts punier than whitebait!
Athena:
Ooh! I can really feel Sasha's frustration!
Phoenix:
(With nobody on her side, she must feel all alone... But helping people like her is the whole reason I became a lawyer in the first place.)
Buckler:
And then I heard about a lawyer named "Phoenix Wright." They say he defends clients to the end, no matter how bleak the circumstances.
Phoenix:
Hmm, guess my reputation DOES precede me. ...Not sure how well-deserved it is, though.
Buckler:
I thought to myself, if anybody can save my friend, it's you, Phoenix.
Phoenix:
(Quite a tall order there for a man who just got his badge back... But I don't want to let Sasha down... or her friend!)
Athena:
Let's help her, Mr. Wright! Let's save her friend!
Phoenix:
That's just what I was thinking. Sasha, we'll accept your case.
Buckler:
Y-You will?! Oh, thank you! You're a life-saver, literally!
Present
Anything
Buckler:
Sorry. Sea creatures are the only things I know anything about...
Phoenix:
That's all right. Don't worry about it. (Gee, I didn't mean to put her in a funk.)
Buckler:
Well, no time to stand around and mullet over things! I want you to meet my friend right away! Come to Shipshape Aquarium with me!
Athena:
You got it!
Apollo:
And I'll go, too!
Phoenix:
Sorry, but I need you to stay here and keep an eye on the office until Trucy gets back. You never know when a new client might stop by.
Apollo:
How come I'M the one who has to stay behind?!
Phoenix:
Thanks a million, Apollo. Well, ladies, let's move to the aquarium, shall we?
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
So what do you think about this case, Apollo?
Apollo:
The murder of the owner of Shipshape Aquarium? ............Gah. I can't think with you looking at me so expectantly. I don't really have any ideas. Sorry I'm not any help.
Athena:
But you ARE a help! As long as you're the one playing officesitter, you're "fine"!
Phoenix:
Hey, there's Apollo's favorite word! I think I'll say it a few times, too. I'm fine! I'm fine!
Apollo:
Are you two making fun of me?
Phoenix:
Who, us? Of course not. (Just yanking your chain a little.)
Any ideas?
Phoenix:
So, any ideas for us?
Apollo:
Well, I think you should give that Swashbuckler video a glance.
Athena:
Starting to become a fan, too, huh? I knew you'd like it if you gave it a chance!
Apollo:
It's not so much that... I just thought it might give you some leads, seeing as it's the scene of the crime and all.
Phoenix:
That's a good idea. I'll take a look when I get a second.
Apollo:
I've got nothing better to do, so maybe I'll watch it a few times myself.
Phoenix:
Apollo... Please try to find something better to do...
Present
Attorney's Badge
Apollo:
The return of a legendary lawyer! It's kind of exciting.
Phoenix:
("Kind of"?) So how do I look with it?
Apollo:
Wow! You present that thing like a real pro! You must've done it a thousand times.
Phoenix:
It never really seems like enough to just have it pinned to my lapel, for some reason.
Apollo:
I get wanting to show it off. When I first became a lawyer, I flashed that badge left and right!
Phoenix:
(Uh, you still do that, actually.)
July 20
Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel
Athena:
Wow, this is gorgeous! It's just like being under the sea!
Buckler:
Yeah, this is the Aqua Tunnel, our pride and joy. I'm r-eel-y glad you like it! I'm going to go on ahead and fill the detective in on your arrival. Take a look around the tunnel, and then come meet me at the pool up ahead on the right.
Athena:
Hey, Boss! Look at this cute little fish!
Phoenix:
Mmm... I bet it would be delicious grilled.
Athena:
Seriously? Is that really all you can think of?
Phoenix:
Well, I didn't get to eat lunch today-- Ooh! And here comes some grilled chicken!
Athena:
That's not a chicken! It's a penguin! C'mere, little cutie!
............*kree*
Athena:
.........It ignored me...
Phoenix:
Maybe it was hungry, too... Oh, look. It dropped something.
Athena:
Ah! It's an ad for the Swashbuckler Spectacular show!
Phoenix:
That penguin had a whole bunch of these stuffed in its backpack.
Athena:
So it's passing out flyers, huh? How cute!
Phoenix:
A carrier penguin that distributes flyers? ...We could use one of those for our office.
Swashbuckler Flyer added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Well, can't keep the client waiting! We'd better get going.
Athena:
Yeah, you're right. Time to roll up our sleeves!
July 20
Shipshape Aquarium -&#160;???
Phoenix:
Huh? I don't see Sasha...
???:
Ah! Are you two the lawyers Ms. Buckler mentioned?
Athena:
Detective Fulbright! Are you the lead detective on this case?!
Fulbright:
That's right. As long as evil exists in this world, there'll be no rest for me! And who is your sea urchin-like friend there? I don't believe we've met...?
Phoenix:
(Is he talking about me?) I'm the defendant's lawyer, Phoenix Wright.
Fulbright:
Well, I'm Detective Bobby Fulbright! People don't usually get to see this area. It's only open now because of the investigation. You two are pretty lucky to get this peek behind the scenes of an aquarium!
Phoenix:
Lucky... Right... (This guy is even louder than Apollo...) So, where is the suspect being questioned? And where is Ms. Buckler?
???:
Here I be, me buckos!
Athena:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
Buckler:
Shiver me timbers! There be one of Dread Pirate Nostache's scurvy swabs!
Fulbright:
I beg your pardon?! I'm not anyone's "swab," "scurvy" or otherwise!
Buckler:
More shameless than a sea lion ye be, tryin' to make off with me best bucko! If ye want to pick a fight with us, ye'd best bring along an army o' great white sharks!
???:
*squeek*... Fweeeeeeet!
Phoenix:
S-Sasha, what's going on here...?
Buckler:
Let me introduce you! This is the friend I was telling you about! Her name is Ora Shipley... ...but she only responds to "Orla," so that's what people call her. I'm her trainer. She's the suspect in the murder, but she'd never hurt anybody.
Orla:
Fweet!
Phoenix:
SHE'S the suspect...?!
Buckler:
Yeah, and thank goodness you came before they put her down! I'm r-eel-y grateful to the two of you. I just know you'll save Orla!
Phoenix:
...WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Fulbright:
Don't tell me you didn't even know who your client was?
Athena:
A-An orca is the suspect? Our client is an orca?! Is this for real?!
Buckler:
Oh, did I forget to mention that? Oopsie!
Phoenix:
(That's one VERY BIG OOPSIE!) By the way, what was with that mustache earlier...?
Buckler:
Oh, this be part of me costume for the Swashbuckler Spectacular! When I be wearin' the mustache, I be one of Cap'n Orla's Swashbucklers! A transformation as dramatic as a puffer fish's, wouldn't you say?
Phoenix:
(I don't think I would ever say that.)
Athena:
It's a pirate-themed aquarium, so that's why Orla is wearing a pirate hat, right?
Buckler:
Yup! She really loves wearing hats. She puts them on all the time. But her fake mustache keeps falling off, so that's a problem...
Phoenix:
I-I see... Well, why don't we start with you telling us a bit more about Orla?
Talk
Orla the orca
Phoenix:
So you're really serious about me defending Orla?
Buckler:
Of course I am! You're the only one who can do it, Phoenix! I heard you once questioned an animal during a trial, and that got your client off the hook!
Athena:
No way! You did that?!
Phoenix:
I, ah... might've tried something like that at one point in my career...
Athena:
Ooh, you're gonna have to tell me all about this later, or I'll ask Apollo for all the juicy details!
Buckler:
When I heard you didn't discriminate against animals, I knew you'd hear me out.
Phoenix:
I have to warn you, though. I don't know anything about orcas. I mean, they don't... eat people, do they...?
Orla:
Fweet! FWEEEEEEET!
Phoenix:
YIKES! (I think I made her mad!)
Buckler:
I won't have you talk that way in front of Orla! Orcas have feelings too, you know!
Athena:
Yeah, Boss! They have emotions just like we do!
Phoenix:
S-Sorry! (Is anger the only feeling I inspire in women?)
Buckler:
Don't worry. She says she forgives you! Besides, orcas are very picky eaters. Orla here only eats fish. The captain went to feed Orla this morning, and then he was found dead in this very room.
Phoenix:
Could you tell us more about his death?
About the murder (appears after "Orla the orca")
Phoenix:
So the owner of the aquarium, Jack Shipley, was discovered murdered...
Buckler:
Yeah... It was about 10:10 this morning, just after the aquarium opened. A visitor was viewing the orca pool from the visitor's corridor and screamed.
Phoenix:
The orca pool is this tank here?
Buckler:
Yeah, that's right. This pool is built so that guests can see into it from the corridor on the first floor. The security guard and I heard the scream and came running into this pool room... ...where we found the captain dead at the side of the pool in his Swashbuckler costume. He was as big and tough as an ol' crocodile, the captain. I still can't believe he's dead...
Athena:
Mr. Shipley was very important to you, wasn't he?
Buckler:
Sorry. I didn't mean to get all sad goldfish on you...
Phoenix:
(Sad goldfish...?)
Buckler:
Okay. Time to snapper out of it! When it's showtime, it's time to smile! That's what the captain always said.
Athena:
...By the way, do you know why exactly Orla is being accused of the crime?
Why is Orla accused? (appears after "About the murder")
Phoenix:
Can you think of any reason why Orla would come under suspicion?
Buckler:
The police think Orla went berserk during practice for the Swashbuckler Spectacular. But Orla would never do anything like that! Right, Orla?
Orla:
Fweeeeeeet! Fwee, fwee!
Athena:
Aw, just look at that face! Isn't she adorable! The charges just HAVE to be false!
Phoenix:
Hate to break it to you, but the police don't usually base its decisions on "cuteness."
Fulbright:
That's right! We base them on facts! Take a look at this.
Phoenix:
(A photo of the victim, huh?) He's got a wound on his head.
Fulbright:
Very perceptive! The victim and the orca were the only ones here. What's more, we couldn't find a weapon of any kind around.
Photo of the Body added to the Court Record.
Athena:
So what's the theory on how Orla supposedly killed the victim?
Fulbright:
They say orcas sometimes kill their prey by ramming into them underwater. We believe this orca did just that by pulling the victim into this 65-foot pool... ...and then ramming into him while they were in the water!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Without any suspects besides Orla, this could be one tough case...)
Orca Pool Diagram added to the Court Record.
Fulbright:
No official autopsy has been ordered, but an orca attack makes sense.
Phoenix:
Why hasn't one been ordered?
Fulbright:
Accidental death due to a failure to exercise proper oversight over an animal. The medical examiner said it wasn't a homicide, so we don't need an autopsy.
Athena:
So Orla's going to be put down without a proper investigation?! That isn't fair! That's nothing short of police negligence, Detective Fulbright!
Fulbright:
The incident wasn't determined a homicide, so there's nothing we can do, Ms. Cykes! Ordinarily, the owner of the aquarium would be held responsible for the oversight failure... ...but the owner is the victim himself, so all we can do is hold the orca responsible.
Buckler:
Phoenix! Isn't there anything you can do?! They're going to put Orla down!
Phoenix:
(Sasha and Orla are depending on me. I want to do everything I can to help them! But how do I help an orca? Wait... Yes, I can do this!)
Find the real killer
Phoenix:
...I'll find the real killer!
Buckler:
Oh, thank you, Phoenix! And I'll do everything I can to help you!
Fulbright:
Wait just one moment! You're not a police officer or a prosecutor! You're not even officially the defendant's lawyer! You have no right to investigate!
Phoenix:
(I'm not officially Orla's lawyer, huh...? In that case, I know exactly what I have to do!)
Leads back to:
"(Yes, I can do this!)"
Defend Orla in court
Leads to:
"(I got my badge back now, so I know exactly what I have to do.)"
Set Orla free
Phoenix:
...I'll set Orla free.
Buckler:
Okay! I'll go open the water gate!
Fulbright:
If you think I'll just let you set the suspect free, you've got another thing coming!
Buckler:
Pollocks to you, punk!
Phoenix:
(I guess until I can actually try to prove Orla's innocence... ...I can't truly set her free... Which means...)
Leads back to:
"(Yes, I can do this!)"
Present
Swashbuckler Spectacular Flyer
Sasha:
Do you two want to be in the Swashbuckler Spectacular?
Phoenix:
You have regular people participate?
Buckler:
Of course! We even have a special tour for people who want to be in it!
Athena:
What roles would we play if we said yes?
Buckler:
Let's see... The roles of a blue seahorse and a yellow sea slug are available!
Phoenix:
Judging by the colors, I must be the seahorse.
Athena:
A-And I'm the sea slug?! No way! I won't do it!
Buckler:
But sea slugs are all fluttery and beautiful, Athena!
Athena:
They're... beautiful? In that case, I'll do it!
Phoenix:
(Her mind is pretty much an open book.)
Buckler:
Ha ha ha! I hope we can do a show together someday!
Phoenix:
(I got my badge back now, so I know exactly what I have to do.) ...I'll defend Orla in court.
Fulbright:
Huh?
Phoenix:
Even an orca deserves a fair trial. If the one responsible for Orla is dead... then I'll take responsibility for her!
Athena:
You'll what?! I guess doing crazy things just once in your career wasn't enough, huh? But what the heck! I'll take responsibility for her, too!
Fulbright:
Are you two insane?! This is a case of accidental death caused by an animal! It's not a murder case! With no evidence of foul play, this case will never go to court!
Phoenix:
Then let us investigate the crime scene. If we can prove this was a murder, we might be able to take it to trial. And then Orla would certainly need the help of a few good lawyers!
Fulbright:
Hmm... I guess so... But who's ever heard of a trial for a killer whale?!
Athena:
Just because it's never been done before doesn't mean we can't do it now!
Fulbright:
But... Hmmmmmmmmm...
Athena:
Please, Detective Fulbright! For justice's sake!
Fulbright:
............ The police have determined that an animal that has harmed a human should be put down. But I don't know for sure whether that was a just decision... If your sense of justice compels you to take on the defense of this animal... ...then my sense of justice tells me to let this case be reexamined for possible merit!
Phoenix:
Y-You mean it?!
Athena:
Really?! That's fantastic! You're not such a bad guy after all, Detective Fulbright!
Fulbright:
Just remember, this case hasn't been officially recognized as a homicide yet. I'll get in touch with the prosecutor's office, but I'm not making any promises. Anyway, I'd better be off!
Buckler:
You two are our lifeboat! I'll be right here if you need me!
Phoenix:
Thanks. I've got a feeling we'll really need your help with this investigation.
Athena:
We're still not sure if it'll go to trial, but as Orla's lawyers, we'll do everything we can!
Phoenix:
To get this case into court, we'll need a prosecutor to make an indictment... ...so we have to find enough evidence to prove it's a criminal case.
Athena:
There just has to be something that shows the culprit was somebody other than Orla!
Phoenix:
Hmm... Detective Fulbright said there were no weapons in the area, other than her... ...so we'd better look for something to prove him wrong. I'd better make a note of that so I don't forget.
Athena:
You sure are organized, Boss! Maybe I should get a notebook of my own!
Phoenix:
I just like to jot down Notes on the case in the Court Record as I go along. We can use it as a sort of "To Do" list.
Athena:
Great idea! I'll add things, too. And whenever we're stuck, we can just refer to the notes!
Phoenix:
(To read the Notes, I just open the Court Record (R). The I can switch between the tabs by touching them, or with R and L.) There! Note jotted. Now let's investigate this crime scene.
Athena:
There has to be some evidence here we can use in court! Examining the crime scene from every angle is the key here!
Phoenix:
That's right. If we change our perspective, we might come across new evidence. To change perspectives, I can touch the arrows on the bottom screen or use [D-Pad].
Athena:
Or, if there's a particular spot that's got your attention, get right up to it and look away!
Phoenix:
(Like that outline of the body in the far right there...?)
Athena:
Of course, talking to everybody involved is one of the keys to good investigation.
Phoenix:
Exactly. And if we Present items to people, we might learn even more.
Athena:
Right! It all boils down to thorough legwork! Well, let's get started!
Talk
Why is Orla accused?
Phoenix:
Okay, let's run through why Orla is under suspicion one more time, shall we?
Buckler:
The police think Orla went berserk during practice for the Swashbuckler Spectacular.
Phoenix:
(No official autopsy has been ordered but the victim's head injury can be seen in the photo. The victim and Orla were the only ones here, and there was no weapon of any kind.)
Athena:
They think Orla dragged the victim into the pool, which is about 65 feet deep... ...and then rammed him in the water.
Buckler:
But Orla would never do anything like that! You two believe me, don't you?!
Phoenix:
We do. We agreed to take on your case, and we'll believe in you to the very end.
Athena:
Great! It's all settled, then. Let's start the investigation!
Examine
Orla (from front)
Athena:
Is that show makeup above Orla's eye?
Buckler:
That's right. It's a starfish. Kinda makes her look like a punk-rockin' pirate, dontcha think?
Phoenix:
(A punk-rock pirate killer whale...? *groan* It's official -- society's on the road to ruin.)
Athena:
Well, I think Orla is one hot rockfish! Speaking of rockin', how do you get Orla to do what you want during the show?
Buckler:
I give her signals with this whistle.
Phoenix:
Oh? But I didn't hear anything just now.
Buckler:
The sound's out of the range of human hearing, just like a dog whistle. Orcas have better hearing than people do. They can even hear the whistle underwater.
Athena:
That's so cool! I wish I could give commands to Orla!
Buckler:
Anybody can do that. All they'd have to do is learn the signals. Here, Athena. You can have one of our whistles. Consider it a present!
Whistle added to the Court Record.
Athena:
Gee, thanks!
Buckler:
As for the actual commands, I'm afraid I can't teach them to you. They're top-secret.
Orla (from front, second time)
Athena:
Is that show makeup above Orla's eye?
Buckler:
That's right. It's a starfish. Kinda makes her look like a punk-rockin' pirate, dontcha think?
Phoenix:
(A punk-rock pirate killer whale...? *groan* It's official -- society's on the road to ruin.)
Athena:
Well, I think Orla is one hot rockfish! Speaking of rockin', how do you get Orla to do what you want during the show?
Buckler:
I give her signals with this whistle.
Phoenix:
Oh? But I didn't hear anything just now.
Buckler:
The sound's out of the range of human hearing, just like a dog whistle. Orcas have better hearing than people do. They can even hear the whistle underwater.
Athena:
That's so cool! I wish I could give commands to Orla!
Buckler:
Anybody can do that. All they'd have to do is learn the signals.
Orla (from left or right)
Phoenix:
(Orla's not going to notice me from here. I'd better move around to the front...)
Ladder
Phoenix:
It doesn't look like the ladder goes all the way down to the bottom of the pool.
Athena:
But there's usually water in the pool, so it doesn't need to. So apparently, the pool spans two whole floors. Ordinarily, visitors only get to see what they can from the first floor... ...but they said on TV that they sometimes give behind-the-scenes tours!
Phoenix:
Sounds likes that Swashbuckler Spectacular show you recorded is really coming in handy.
Octopus
Athena:
Yikes! Look at that huge octopus!
Phoenix:
That must be a show prop, too. One of its legs is missing, though.
Athena:
Wouldn't it be exciting to take on a huge enemy like that?! I'd like to give it a try, myself -- as a lawyer, that is!
Phoenix:
(You know you have an insufficient number of limbs to out-object it, right...?)
Backdrop
Phoenix:
A setting sun... Sunsets always remind me how quickly the day goes by...
Athena:
Oh, Boss! It's just a painted backdrop, you know!
Phoenix:
Down, Athena. Of course I know. I guess they use it for the Swashbuckler Spectacular.
Athena:
It looks handmade. Ooh, I just got an idea! Why don't we make our own "not guilty" backdrop?
Phoenix:
And present it to the judge when things aren't going our way?
Athena:
No, we put psychological pressure on the judge by hanging it behind the defendant!
Phoenix:
I... almost want to see how the judge would respond to that...
Hoist
Athena:
Hey, look! There's an apparatus here to hang from.
Phoenix:
I don't think it's for people to hang from. It looks more like a crane to move things with.
Athena:
But Sasha was hanging from it during the Swashbuckler Spectacular. I bet there are all kinds of ways to use it, not just to move things. C'mon, Boss! Try thinking outside the box!
Phoenix:
(Is she trying to say I have a narrow-minded view of things?)
Hoop or piece of meat
Phoenix:
There's a piece of meat and a plastic hoop suspended from the ceiling. Talk about a clashy décor.
Athena:
I guess Orla really likes meat. Who knew they fed her such huge chunks, though.
Phoenix:
Uh, all orcas are carnivores. You knew that, right?
Athena:
Of course, silly! And I love meat, too! Protein is your body's basic building block, after all!
Phoenix:
But that meat is made out of rubber. I doubt Orla could really eat it, even if she wanted to.
Athena:
You mean to tell me she jumps all the way up there and doesn't get her reward? The poor girl! After all that effort!
Phoenix:
I don't think Orla is as dumb as you think she is...
Door
Phoenix:
The doors are slightly open, and there are police officers standing guard outside.
Athena:
I guess they're watching to make sure we don't try any funny business.
Phoenix:
Well, now that you've said it, I suddenly feel the urge to do something.
Athena:
How about if I suddenly break out some squat exercises? That would be pretty funny.
Phoenix:
Yeah... that might cause a few raised eyebrows in ways you don't want, Athena...
Ball
Phoenix:
Oh, look. There's a ball in the water. Is that another prop for the show?
Buckler:
That's one of Orla's toys. She plays volleyball with it. It's usually in the bin. Guess I must've forgotten to put it away yesterday.
Athena:
Wow, I wish I could play volleyball with Orla!
Buckler:
You have as much fight in you as a mean, old lobster! I like it! There aren't many people who wanna be on the receiving end of Orla's fast ball!
Athena:
H-Her fast ball?!
Buckler:
Yeah. She likes to be naughty and slam the ball into things around the pool. You should hear the sound that ball makes when it crashes into stuff!
Athena:
U-Uh, well, maybe some other time...!
Phoenix:
(She suddenly went from "fighting lobster" to "reluctant hermit crab"...)
Shark cannon
Athena:
Hey, there's a cannon in the shape of a shark! I'd love to try firing that thing! Boom!
Phoenix:
Are these cannonballs supposed to look like fish eggs or something...?
Athena:
Hm? But why fish eggs? Why not baby sharks? Think about how crazy it would be to have sharks go flying through the air! Watch the thrilling life-or-death struggle as the little tykes fight to stay alive out of water! I can see it now! The drama! The mayhem! The whirlwind of teeth!
Phoenix:
(A tornado of sharks? Not even Hollywood could conjure up something that insane.)
Control panel
Phoenix:
Looks like the control panel for that crane apparatus. There sure are a lot of buttons...
Athena:
When I see this many buttons, I start to get fidgety.
Phoenix:
I know what you mean. You start itching to push them, right?
Athena:
Nah, I start itching to make a psychological study of people who want to push buttons!
Phoenix:
...Need I remind you that I'm your boss, not your guinea pig?
Boxes and props (from far away)
Phoenix:
(It's too far away to get a good look. I'd better get a little closer first.)
Boxes and props (from close up)
Athena:
What a mess! Was all this stuff knocked over when the victim struggle [sic] with his killer?
Phoenix:
It's possible, but it would be hard to prove. Let's take a closer look, shall we?
Boxes
Athena:
Look at all this stuff scattered everywhere! I see some swords! I wonder if they have anything to do with the case?!
Phoenix:
They're made of rubber. I doubt they could be used as a weapon.
Athena:
But I still bet if someone got whapped with one, it would sting quite a bit.
Phoenix:
...Yeah, I guess it would.
Athena:
But I think I could stand the pain.
Phoenix:
Yeah? Good for you... (Oh, look. There's a blow-up dolphin and an anchor, too.)
Athena:
Mr. Wright! Are you even listening to me? Stop looking at those toys!
Phoenix:
(Yikes! Guess I've been caught red-faced!)
Outline
Athena:
Ugh. So this is where the body was found, huh?
Phoenix:
If they suspect Orla, maybe they found some evidence of an attack on the victim...?
Buckler:
Orla didn't attack the captain! She loved him! The captain rescued Orla when she was little, after she got beached on the shore. He tried to release her into the ocean, but she kept coming back. I can tell Orla's sad about losing the captain. She's just not her usual chipper self.
Athena:
Orla must really love this aquarium and the captain.
Buckler:
She's the only one around here big and strong enough to play with the big, tough captain. Every day, she made a point of head-butting him and stealing his hat.
Phoenix:
Yikes! I guess you weren't kidding when you said the captain was a really strong guy.
Anything else
Phoenix:
(Nothing much to see here.)
Phoenix:
I guess that's about it.
Athena:
Under different circumstances, I would've loved to see the Swashbuckler Spectacular...
Buckler:
The three of us always performed the show together -- me, Orla, and the captain... Today's show has been canceled, but we could put on a little performance for you now! We be Cap'n Orla's Swashbucklers, me buckos! We love to sail the seven seas! We've come to rout that mangy blaggard, Dread Pirate Nostache! Avast! There he be, Nostache himself! Prepare to feed the fish!
Phoenix:
Um... am I playing the role of "Nostache"?
Athena:
Well, Sasha has a "stache," and you don't, so I guess so...
Buckler:
Hit 'im with yer water cannon, Cap'n, and spare no quarter!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaagh!
Orla:
Fwe fwe fweet. Fwe fwe fwe fweeet! Fwe fwe fwe fweet fwe fwe fweet!
Buckler:
We swim through storms and wave all because you see... Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me!
Athena:
Wow! That was awesome! Your performance packed quite a wallop!
Phoenix:
Yeah... I, for one, feel like I took quite a beating...
Buckler:
Sorry 'bout that! Can't have a show without a bad-guy role, right?
Phoenix:
But a singing orca, huh? It must've been tough to train her to do that.
Buckler:
That's Orla's best trick. She can only sing one song, though.
Phoenix:
(Well, she's still got one up on a pianist who can't play even one song...) Well, now that we've had a taste of the show, we'd better do some more investigating.
Athena:
Good idea. Let's go to the Aqua Tunnel!
Examine
(I guess we already checked this out, but no harm in giving it another look.)
Present
Whistle
Buckler:
Oh, have you been using the whistle I gave you?
Athena:
Of course! But I can't get Orla to do any tricks.
Phoenix:
I can't believe you can command that huge creature. That's pretty impressive, Sasha.
Buckler:
Pretty cool, huh? I bet there aren't too many people who can say... ...they literally get to "whistle while they work."
Phoenix:
(That must be pretty nice for you.)
Buckler:
But Orla is the one who's impressive, really, not me.
Athena:
It's easy to see how much you care about Orla.
Phoenix:
You two are a good team.
Athena:
What...?! But you and I are a great team, right? We can top that!
Wright Anything Agency:
Present
Whistle
Apollo:
What's this? Something you wear around your neck?
Phoenix:
It's a whistle they use to make the orca do her tricks.
Athena:
If I blow it at you, will you do a trick?
Apollo:
What am I, some kind of circus animal to you two?
Phoenix:
Well, you ARE one of the talents here at our Wright Anything Agency, after all. The least you could do is learn a trick or two.
Apollo:
Need I remind I'm a lawyer?! Besides, Athena doesn't know any tricks!
Athena:
Hee hee! That's what YOU think! I've got a special trick I've been waiting to bust out. I can chug an entire glass of OJ without taking a breath, all while doing squats!
Apollo:
Well... that's, uh, really something, Athena...
Phoenix:
(I don't think I want to see Athena do squats...)
Anything else
Apollo:
Evidence...? Does this mean you want me at the defense's bench in court?!
Phoenix:
No. I just wanted to see what you think.
Apollo:
Oh. Darn... In that case, I don't think you want to hear what I think.
Aqua Tunnel (before examining crime scene):
Talk
What to do
Athena:
We have to find some evidence that shows the culprit wasn't Orla! 
Phoenix:
You're really fired up for this, aren't you?
Athena:
Well, I'm getting pretty good at investigating, thanks to that last case. So I want to show you how much I've learned! Vamos a hacer esto! Let's check out the scene!
Phoenix: 
I'm glad to see your enthusiasm, but if you run like that, you're going to fall. 
Athena:
Aaaaaaaaagh!
Phoenix: 
...Too late.
Any ideas?
Athena:
Well... I have noticed there's an amazing chemistry between Orla and Sasha.
Phoenix:
Not those kinds of ideas. I mean, any thoughts on the case?
Athena:
My thoughts are that we don't have enough information yet. That is what my heart is telling me.
Phoenix:
(In other words, you don't have any ideas. Got it.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Athena:
I'm so glad you got your attorney's badge back, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Me too. I guess I was always meant to be a lawyer. I'm going to polish it up, shinier than it's ever been!
Athena:
I can top that! I'm going to polish mine until the finish comes off!
Phoenix:
Never mind. You win.
Swashbuckler Flyer
Athena:
Ooh, the Swashbuckler Spectacular is so exciting! I could watch it a hundred times! The fierce fighting, the graceful moves! Oh, Orla and Sasha are so cool!
Phoenix:
If you love the show so much, why don't you try auditioning to be in it?
Athena:
Hey, I know! The whole office could be in it together! We could be the "Anything Pirate Band"! You know, from the name of the agency!
Phoenix:
Sounds like a pretty pathetic pirate band to me. 
Athena:
What are you talking about?! It sounds cutthroat! It means we'd do "anything" to get our hands on treasure! Anything, no matter how brutal!
Phoenix:
Yikes. We're a brutal pirate band?!
Whistle
Athena:
Phwiiiiip! Phwiiip, phwiiip!
Phoenix:
I didn't ask if you could blow it. It's such a weird whistle, anyway. It doesn't even make a proper "whistle" sound.
Athena:
Most people can't hear it, but I think I can hear it a little bit. It's like a message that only Orla's heart can receive! Aw, that's so sweet!
Phoenix:
It's the same idea as a dog whistle, so I wonder if dogs can hear it, too?
Athena:
Grr! Now you ruined it! You don't know anything about girls, do you?
Anything else
Athena:
Oh, I get it. Your current state of mind is: "Gather all the information we can get." But let's concentrate on USEFUL information from now on, okay, Boss?
July 20
Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel
Fulbright:
So you all done investigating the pool already?
Phoenix:
We had a good look around, but now we're moving on to other areas.
Athena:
How is the police investigation going? Did you -- say, for example -- find any other suspects besides Orla...?
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Wouldn't that be fortunate for you if we did? But no, I'm afraid not. And even more unfortunate for you... ...I'm afraid we found decisive evidence of the orca's guilt.
Phoenix:
(What?!) P-Please tell us more, Detective!
Talk
Proof the orca did it
Athena:
So what's this "decisive evidence"?! Don't hold out on us now, Detective Fulbright!
Fulbright:
I'm very sorry, but I can't share classified information with the defense. Especially not security footage that shows the moment the orca attacked the victim! Yup, I'm to personally see to it that this baby stays safe! It will never leave my side!
Policeman:
'Scuse me, but there's a call for you, Detective.
Fulbright:
I'll be right there! Sorry guys, you know how it is!
Athena:
Well, he never said that HE wouldn't leave ITS side, I guess... Now, let's sneak a peek! Wh-What the--?!
Phoenix:
Is this supposed to be  the moment Orla attacked the victim...?
Security Footage added to the Court Record. 
Athena:
This little bit of footage doesn't prove anything!
Phoenix:
I agree. I believe in Orla and Sasha. Let's just continue with our investigation.
Athena:
Good idea! ...Huh? There's a sticker on this camera that says, "Return to the Pub O' Danger."
Phoenix:
Guess somebody there manages the cameras? Let's check it out later.
Fulbright:
Sorry about that. Prosecutor Blackquill called to remind me to go feed Taka. So where were we...? Oh, that's right! You two got any more questions for me?
Phoenix:
No, we're good. Thank you. (For leaking all your info!)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Fulbright:
So that's your symbol of justice, is it? Well, this is MINE!
Phoenix:
(...Wow. He can whip that badge out pretty fast...) 
Athena:
We can top that! Take THIS! Twin attorney's badges!
Fulbright:
Aaagh! No fair! Two against one!
Athena:
No fair! Your police badge is bigger and flashier!
Fulbright:
What?! You dare to call me... "unfair"?! Me, the very model of justice itself?!
Athena:
Boss! I'd say we won this round!
Phoenix:
Athena, in this battle there are no winners...
Photo of the Body
Fulbright:
The poor victim... It's heart-wrenching! Crime cannot go unpunished!
Phoenix:
We don't want crime to go unpunished, either.
Athena:
But we'll do our utmost to defend our client.
Fulbright:
Hmm. Your form of justice or mine... Which is true justice? I guess we'll see how it plays out.
Athena:
In other words, he doesn't have enough information right now to make up his mind. 
Phoenix:
Thank you for the translation, Athena.
Anything else
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! I have NOTHING to say about that! If you're lawyers of any mettle, you'll find the answers for yourselves!
July 20
Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger
Athena:
This looks like one of those hands-on exhibits. It has a real air of danger, don't you think?!
Phoenix:
Well, the banner does say it's the "PUB O' DANGER"... 
Athena:
Let's see. According to the description, this room is... ..."A pub where pirates gather. Explore and interact with sea creatures! Actually feel the electricity of electric eels and feed real piranhas! Experience the terror of the seas with these dangerous experiments!"
Phoenix:
All of those sounds less like "terror" and more like "torture" to me!
???:
Ahem! I'd thank you to keep it down there, blue boy. I'm conducting an experiment! Do not disturb me, unless you wish to be zapped with an electric eel!
Phoenix:
M-My apologies, ma'am. (Wow. She seems intense...)
Athena:
Excuse me, but who are you?
???:
Before you ask others, shouldn't you give YOUR name first? Basic manners, young lady. 
Athena:
O-Oh, yes! Of course! My name is--
DePlume:
Never mind. I will simply call you "yellow girl." It's easier that way. I am Norma DePlume. I am very interested in Shipshape Aquarium, and am a frequent visitor here.
Athena:
B-But... I don't want to be "yellow girl"!
Phoenix:
You think I want to be called "blue boy"? ...*sigh* Let's just see what she has to say.
Talk
Norma DePlume
Athena:
You say you're interested in the aquarium, but you don't look like a staff member. Hmm... Let's see... I got it! You're someone completely unrelated to this aquarium!
Phoenix:
(That's some deductive reasoning there champ.) 
DePlume:
I am a visitor, a patron, a customer, a guest... And  what might you be?
Athena:
I'm not a "what"! I'm a lawyer!
Phoenix:
(Hey, that's what I was going to say!) A-And I run a law office!   
DePlume:
Well, whatever you are, I don't have the slightest interest. 
Athena:
Grr! Just who does she think she is, Boss?!
Phoenix:
"A visitor, a patron, a customer, a guest," remember?
Why you're here
Athena:
I thought they closed the aquarium and weren't letting members of the public in?
DePlume:
Oh ho ho! But I have special permission, you see.
Phoenix:
And why exactly is that, if I may ask?
DePlume:
Well, because of the incide-- Heavens! I've said too much.
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
I-I remember this...! Psyche-Locks!
Athena:
Huh? Psychedelic rock? Cyborg clocks? What?!
Phoenix:
No, no. "Psyche-Locks." It's the power of this Magatama. It gives me the ability to see the  secrets locked away in somebody's heart. If I can remove the locks, I can uncover their secrets. 
Athena:
I didn't know you had a magical item like that!
Phoenix:
It looks like this lady knows something about what happened. I'll just use my Magatama and undo her Psyche-Locks. (Huh? I can't see the locks anymore!)      
Athena:
Huh? The color of that stone looks different from before.
Phoenix:
That's funny. Maybe it's just out of juice...?
Athena:
I-It can do that?
Phoenix:
Yeah. A certain girl I know poured her spiritual power into it for me. Without that power, I can't undo the Psyche-Locks.
Athena:
No way!
DePlume:
Hmph! Why do I have to keep quiet about it, anyway?! I've never been any good at keeping secrets. But I did promise after all, so I guess I had better keep my mouth shut... 
Phoenix:
Who did you promise what to?
DePlume:
No comment. Now, go away!
Phoenix:
&#42;sigh* Just when I thought we could find out more about the case...
Athena:
Let's go try to find some other way! I'm sure we'll find something!
Why you're here (second time)
Athena:
I thought they closed the aquarium and weren't letting members of the public in?
DePlume:
Oh ho ho! But I have special permission, you see.
Phoenix:
And why exactly is that, if I may ask?
DePlume:
Well, because of the incide-- Heavens! I've said too much.
Phoenix:
(Without some spiritual power, the Magatama can't help me unlock Ms. DePlume's secret. I guess we'll just have to think of some other way.)
Present
Swashbuckler Flyer
DePlume:
A Swashbuckler flyer? I have more than enough of those already. Do you have any idea how many times I've visited this aquarium?!
Phoenix:
(Hey, what are you yelling at me for?) Don't you ever get tired of coming here?
DePlume:
Hmph! You obviously don't know anything about Shipshape Aquarium. They feature different marine creatures each month, so visitors never get bored.
Athena:
So you're a fan of Shipshape Aquarium, like me?
DePlume:
Oh, please! I'm here to gather information-- the fundamental work of a great writer. But I don't suppose that's something you common folk would understand...
Athena:
Grr! That woman makes me so mad! 
Phoenix:
Now, now. Why don't we "common folk" just get back to our investigation?
Security Footage
DePlume:
Don't thrust that under my nose! I won't watch it!
Phoenix:
Are you usually pretty photogenic, Ms. DePlume?
DePlume:
Of course I am! I've been compared to a movie star! It's little wonder, with my perfect makeup and stylish figure. Wouldn't you agree?
Phoenix:
(She wants me to agree?!) Let's get a woman's opinion on this one.
Athena:
What? You're asking me?! Well, uh, let's see. I DO think you're very pretty, Ms. DePlume.
DePlume:
Hmm? I get the distinct impression your words are full of hidden meaning...
Athena:
Well... I wouldn't say "full" so much as "full-figured"...
Phoenix:
A-Athena! I'd stop right there if I were you.
Anything else
DePlume:
I have no interest in looking at meaningless trifles. As a matter of fact, I have no interest in looking at you, blue boy. 
Phoenix:
(What, so now I'm a "meaningless trifle," too?)
July 20
Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel
Athena:
Hey, Detective Fulbright's gone. It looks like the police investigation is over, too. 
Phoenix:
That's too bad. I was hoping to get a little more out of him. 
???:
Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Cleaner? Nuh uh. Feeder? That's right! Yo girl why you hidin' from me? I'm searching all 'round like this be a bad dream.
Phoenix:
(Is that somebody... rapping?)
???:
Rifle yo sometimes you make me so mad. But now that you're gone I'm just so sad. Yo Rifle just come back to me. We can be together and sing kree kree kree!
Phoenix:
What's with this guy, rapping and making strange bird sounds...?
???:
Yikes! W-Who's there?! ...You didn't hear me rappin', did ya?!
Phoenix:
Yeah, well... Maybe...
???:
Arrrrrrr! Look, just do me a favor and pretend ya didn't hear nothin'!
Phoenix:
Fine by us. And who might you be?
Rimes:
I'm Marlon Rimes. I'm an animal keeper here. But the aquarium is already closed today. Um, at least, I'm pretty sure it is...
Athena:
Pretty sure? You don't sound too certain... Oh! Are you new here or something?
Rimes:
Wow! Yeah, that's right! Pretty good guess! So who are you guys?
Phoenix:
I'm Phoenix Wright.
Athena:
And I'm Athena Cykes. We're lawyers, and we're going to represent Orla... ...by taking her case to court and proving she's innocent!
Rimes:
A-Are ya serious?! You wanna defend an orca in COURT?! ...Oh! But if you're here for Orla, that must make ya friends of Sasha's... Sorry if I came across rude.
Phoenix:
(Sounds like he's friends with Sasha.)
Rimes:
Sometimes when I'm by myself, I like to rap to pass the time. Especially when I'm around the animals I love. 
Athena:
Ooh, I love animals, too! Especially marine creatures, like dolphins!
Phoenix:
I like marine creatures, too. (But just the ones you can eat.)
Rimes:
Yeah? Well, people who like animals are good people. That's what I always say! If there's anything I can do for you two, just say the word! I just started workin' here, though, so I dunno how much help I can be. 
Athena:
Mr. Rimes seems pretty friendly.
Phoenix:
Yeah, friendly and agreeable.
Talk
Marlon Rimes
Athena:
So, what exactly do you do here as an animal keeper?
Rimes:
Mainly, I clean the place and feed the animals. Wiping all this glass takes forever!
Phoenix:
(I can imagine... This tunnel alone must take most of the day.)
Rimes:
I also prep the food the animals eat. That's the hardest part of all.
Athena:
You mean, it's really difficult to get the hang of?
Rimes:
Nah, I mean, I'm a vegetarian, so cuttin' fish and meat and stuff up creeps me out.
Phoenix:
Now there's something I never expected to hear from a pirate.
About the murder
Phoenix:
Do you know anything about the incident that took place this morning?
Rimes:
Yeah. One of our guests saw what happened and started screamin'. I came runnin', but by the time I got there, I couldn't see the orca or the captain.
Athena:
Speaking of the captain... what was he like?
Rimes:
Like a strong captain who can turn a wild bunch of ruffians into some great pirates... He always treated us fairly and equally, human and fishes alike. The real deal, man. ...Hey! Wh-what are YOU cryin' for?!
Athena:
I-I'm not crying! It's just, I can feel your heart crying, that's all.
Rimes:
G-Girl, whatchu talkin' about?! I'm not cryin', either!
Phoenix:
(I guess I won't mention that his eyes are puffier than a pair of pufferfish...)
Rimes:
I bet Sasha and our vet Dr. Crab are even more upset by his death. 
Phoenix:
Vet? This aquarium has a resident vet?
Rimes:
Yeah... Yo, hold up! I haven't seen Dr. Crab this morning. Staff are supposed to stay put. The night shift has been on duty since last night, but they won't let us go home. Sasha even had to get special permission to go out looking for a lawyer this morning.
Athena:
Hmm... We haven't seen anybody who looks like a vet.
Rifle
Athena:
Were you rapping something about looking for a weapon earlier? A rifle or something...?
Rimes:
Ha ha ha! No, not a weapon! "Rifle" is the name of one of our penguins.
Athena:
A penguin? Why would you name a penguin something like that?
Rimes:
Ahoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Prep for the battle, prep for the war! Little lady Rifle gon' even da score! Ya'll [sic] think you can escape with your pride? Nuh uh, you just gon' be straight up denied! Yo! Yo! Yo ho ho! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Anyway, that's what she's like, so we named her " Rifle."
Phoenix:
...Okay, but did you have to rap it?
Rimes:
That's just how I roll.
Athena:
Does Rifle wear a backpack, by any chance?
Rimes:
Yeah, that's the one! So you've seen her, huh? She's always runnin' away! She's such a good runner, we decided to put her to work deliverin' flyers.
Phoenix:
Do you really want a dangerous penguin like that running loose?!
Rimes:
Aw, Rifle's not dangerous. She only attacks people she doesn't like. 
Athena:
When we ran into her earlier, she didn't attack us. She straight up ignored us, actually.
Rimes:
Hey, I have an idea! If you run into Rifle again, would ya mind feedin' her for me? She didn't come back to the pool at feedin' time like usual, so I've been lookin' for her. She loves the smell of fish, so she might come over to you if you have some.
Athena:
Ooh, I would LOVE to feed a penguin! That'd be okay, right, Boss?
Phoenix:
I don't mind, as long as YOU carry the fish.
Fish handed over to Athena.   
Athena:
P-U! It smells so... fishy!
Phoenix:
(Really? What a shocker...)
Present
Swashbuckler Flyer
Rimes:
With this flyer, you can get a penguin sleep mask the next time you come in.
Phoenix:
Oh, yeah? That would be nice, especially if it's free.
Athena:
That'd be perfect for taking a nap at the office after going for a run or something!
Phoenix:
I prefer you DIDN'T take naps at the office, actually.
Rimes:
Yeah, I feel ya! Sometimes I fall asleep when I'm feedin' the animals.
Athena: 
I guess only a newbie can truly understand the feelings of another newbie!
Rimes:
Heh heh. We're kindred spirits, my sister. Kindred spirits.
Athena:
Two peas in a pod! Birds of a feather!
Phoenix:
I suddenly feel so alone.
Fish
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, about this fish...
Rimes:
I'm the master keeper! No way you can beat me! You're a pro lawyer, but an amateur feeder! Ya'll [sic] ready for a feeding throw-down? Rifle c'mon! Time to defend da crown!
Phoenix:
............ Uh, it doesn't look like Rifle's coming...
Rimes:
............I guess not, huh? Sorry about all that "throw-down" stuff, then... I just wanted to show ya the inner secrets of animal feedin'.
Phoenix:
There are "inner secrets"?
Rimes:
You know, stuff like how to debone a fish. Great care goes into each animal's food. Then of course there's the way of tossin' the food to 'em. It's different for each one.
Phoenix:
...I see. Sorry to have bothered you with mundane questions from the uninitiated.
Anything else
Rimes:
I'm new here, so I dunno.
Phoenix:
(I don't really think being "new here" has anything to do with it in this instance...)
Rimes:
Oh, yeah. Besides Rifle, I've been lookin' for Small Fry, too.
Phoenix:
"Small Fry"? Is that another penguin?
Rimes:
Nah, she's a friend I made, a high-school girl. She went off lookin' for Rifle somewhere and hasn't been back.
Athena:
Is she... your girlfriend?
Rimes:
What?! Nah, no way! Sasha is the one I--
Athena:
So you like Ms. Buckler, do you!
Rimes:
Well, I-I really respect her, ya know? We have different tastes in music, but I admire the way she lives her life! It's not like I "like" her. It's more complicated than that...
Phoenix:
(I'm pretty sure that all adds up to "like"...)
Rimes:
She tries to put on a brave face... ...but I think the captain's death is hittin' her hardest of all. After all, it was her human show partner that got killed by that orca.
Athena:
So you think Orla really did it?
Rimes:
Well, I can understand how Sasha feels... ...but she's the only one of us who doesn't think the orca did it.
Athena:
Oh, I see...
Phoenix:
(I guess it isn't easy to believe in somebody who can't even speak up for herself...)
Rimes:
Anyway, let me know if you see Rifle or Small Fry, okay? Small Fry said she was gonna go check the orca pool. 
Phoenix:
Maybe we'll head back there, then.

Phoenix:
Hey, Apollo. Think you could whip us up a little meal with these?
Apollo:
Fish? I haven't had fish for a while, come to think of it... ...The obvious question, though, is "What are you doing with a bunch of raw fish?!"
Athena:
It's to feed the penguin with!
Apollo:
Penguin?! So why are you giving it to me to cook?!
Phoenix:
Oh, I dunno. I just happened to think of it, and I was hungry.
Apollo:
Then why don't we all go out for sushi when you wrap up the investigation?
Athena:
Oh, you're going to treat us?! How sweet of you! I'll start with tuna!
Phoenix:
That's really generous of you, Apollo. Don't forget to invite Trucy, too.
Apollo:
...Why did I even open my mouth?

Athena:
That's how it goes in the Swashbuckler Spectacular! Present a fish. Start fighting. The gauntlet--I mean, the fish--is thrown down, and the glorious battle begins! Ooh, you're so cool when you're up there jumping and slashing!
Buckler:
Arr! Belay that talk, li'l lassie! Compliments will get ye naught!
Athena:
Ooh! You sound just exactly like a real pirate! Hee hee!

Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool
Phoenix:
(Huh? There's something on the left side of the pool that wasn't here before...) It looks like an electronic sword...?
Buckler:
Hey, you're back!
Phoenix:
Hi, Sasha. What's with this strange sword here?
Buckler:
Oh, that's a walkie-talkie. It's probably Rifle's.
Athena:
R-Rifle can use a walkie-talkie?!
Buckler:
She's always running away, so we attached a walkie-talkie to her. If we can hear the sounds around her, we can usually guess where she is.
Phoenix:
(But not if she drops the walkie-talkie on the floor.)
Buckler:
Every member of the crew has one, too, so we can communicate back and forth. We can even use them to broadcast to specific parts of the aquarium. Cool, huh?
Walkie-Talkie added to the Court Record.
Athena:
Well, if Rifle's walkie-talkie is here, then Rifle might still be here, too! Rifle! Come out, come out, wherever you are!
*SPLASH!*
Athena:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Orla:
Fweet?
Buckler:
Are you okay? You have to be careful around pools, or you might slip right in!
Athena:
I'm more afraid of my heart jumping right out!
Phoenix:
Hey, who's that riding on Orla? Isn't that Rifle?
Athena:
Hey, you're right! C'mere, Rifle!
Rifle:
............ *kree*
Athena:
Argh! She ignored mem again! Why doesn't that penguin like me?! Graaaaagh!
Phoenix:
Now you've scared Rifle away with all that yelling...
Athena:
Well, I'm not giving up! I'll MAKE that penguin like me if it's the last thing I do!
Anime cutscene
Athena:
Hey! Get back here, you little pipsqueak!
Rifle:
*kree!*
Pearl:
Oh, sorry Rifle. But at least you seem alright.
Athena:
Huh?
Pearl:
Oh!
Phoenix:
(Hey... It's... It's...) Pearls?!
Pearl:
Oh! Mr. Nick! I haven't seen you in ages!
Phoenix:
(Could Pearls be the "Small Fry" Mr. Rimes was talking about?)
Pearls:
Congratulations on your return to lawyering! I've been thinking about stopping by your office for a visit to congratulate you.
Phoenix:
(This is Pearl Fey. I call her "Pearls." She may dress a little funny... ...but that's because she's a spirit medium -- a real prodigy with great power, at that. I've known her since she was little, and she sometimes comes to the office to visit. She's just a little older than Trucy, so she's been like a big sister to her.)
Pearls:
I guess everyone here knows Mr. Nick, then? He's such a nice guy, don't you think?
Phoenix:
(...Is she trying to be MY big sister too, now?!)
Talk
Pearl Fey
Phoenix:
What are you doing here, Pearls?
Pearl:
My summer camp is here on a field trip. I've never been to such a big aquarium before, so I was really looking forward to it! But then that incident happened... and the police just finished questioning me.
Phoenix:
Oh, I see.
Pearl:
Um...Mr. Nick...? Who is that lady next to you...?
Athena:
I'm Athena Cykes! I'm a new lawyer at the Wright Anything Agency!
Pearl:
Oh, how do you do! My name is Pearl Fey. My cousin and my friends call me "Pearly."
Athena:
"Pearly" it is, then! Nice to meet you!
Pearl:
So... how did the two of you meet...?
Phoenix:
Well, you know how I used to travel to Europe to study their legal systems, Pearls? I met Athena on one of those trips.
Meeting Athena
Pearl:
So, tell me more about how the two of you met in Europe. 
Phoenix:
(Hey, I thought I was supposed to be asking the questions here!)   
Athena:
A long time ago, Mr. Wright helped me out of a difficult jam. That's when I started thinking about becoming a lawyer like him.
Pearl:
So you're like her mentor, huh, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Yeah, something like that, I guess.
Athena:
Mr. Wright is the whole reason I am who I am today! He was the one who told me my knowledge of psychology could help people in court!
Pearl:
Gee, Mr. Nick, it looks like you've become a real adult since the last time I saw you!
Phoenix:
(I've always been an adult the entire time I've known you, Pearls!)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Pearl:
Oh, I'm so happy you get to be a lawyer again, Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
Ha ha. Thanks. I let our friends know I was back, too.
Pearl:
I wish we could all get together. It's been quite a while! Maybe we should throw you a surprise party to celebrate your comeback.
Phoenix:
That would be really nice. But if you tell me about it, it won't be a surprise, you know.
Pearl:
Oh! B-But we could spring it on you after you had forgotten, and still surprise you!
Swashbuckler Flyer
Pearl:
I was really looking forward to seeing the Swashbuckler Spectacular... It's such a shame.
Phoenix:
Yeah. I bet you would've really enjoyed it.
Pearl:
But I was really happy to see such a large marine animal! It was quite an experience! ...I still have yet to see a blue whale, though, the largest marine animal of them all!
Phoenix:
Yeah, uh... I doubt there are any blue whales at the aquarium.
Fish
Pearl:
Oh my! Did you go fishing, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
No, this is for Rifle. We were asked to feed her.
Pearl:
Ooh, that sounds like fun! Do you think she would take food from me?
Phoenix:
Oh, I'm sure she would--from you.
Athena:
...So what you're really trying to say is that Rifle wouldn't take food from ME, right?!
Phoenix:
No, that's not what I meant. (That IS what I meant, though.)   
Athena:
Grr! I won't be bested! Pearly, it's ON!
Pearl:
Wh-What? What's "on"?
Phoenix:
Now, now, Athena. Let's be adults about this. You've got poor Pearls here all confused.
Anything else
Pearl:
You know I'd do anything I could to help you! ...But I'm afraid I don't really know anything about that...
Phoenix:
That's all right, Pearls. No worries.
Rifle:*kreeeee*
Athena:
Well, would you look at that! Rifle loves you!
Phoenix:
She sure does seem to be attracted to Pearls...
Pearl:
Hee hee! I'm so glad she likes me! Penguins are so adorable, aren't they! I even bought myself a little penguin calendar here at the aquarium gift shop. I have it hanging from my bag already!
Athena:
Oh, how cute! A calendar in the shape of a penguin!
Buckler:
That calendar is a real hit with all our female visitors. I even have one myself! But the rest of the staff thinks it's... too cutesy. 
Phoenix:
I guess it doesn't really fit the whole "rough-and-tumble pirate" image very well... But, hmm... why does this calendar smell kind of like fish...?
Pearl:
Wh-What do you mean, Mr. Nick?! Please don't be rude!
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. I got Pearls mad...)
Calendar added to the Court Record.
Talk
Rifle
Phoenix:
So you were looking for Rifle, too?
Pearl:
That's right. I was trying to help Mr. Marlon, the animal keeper.
Athena:
C'mere, Rifle! C'mon!
Rifle:
*kree!*
Phoenix:
She went towards Orla instead.
Athena:
Grrrrr! Why can't I get Rifle to like me?!
Phoenix:
Maybe you should quit chasing after her with that scowl of yours...
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! How could you speak to a lady so rudely?!
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. I got Pearls mad... again.) Why don't you try to get Rifle to take some food from you?
Athena:
Oh, great idea! And I have just the thing to offer her, too!
Present
Calendar
Pearl:
Isn't it cute? I really love this calendar.
Phoenix:
It's shaped like a penguin. It is pretty cute, isn't it? Maybe I should buy a calendar for the office before I leave. I always run out of room to write appointments in my planner.
Athena:
Why don't you just put your appointments on your phone?
Phoenix:
I'm not very good at using electronic devices...
Pearl:
Oh, neither am I. Hee hee! We have something in common!
Athena:
Aw, now I feel left out.
Fish (after clearing "Rifle" Talk option)
Leads to:
"Rifle! I have a present for you!"
Athena:  
Rifle! I have a present for you! It's chock-filled with love! Here you go!
Orla:
Fwee, fweet!
Athena:
Hey! Orla ate my love-filled fish! At least it looks like she enjoyed it, though.
Orla:
Fwee, fweet!
Athena:
I think Orla and I just had a bonding moment!
Pearl:
Friendship blossoming with the exchange of some food! Oh, isn't it moving, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
I think "moving" might be going a bit far... Anyway, how did you get Rifle to come to you so easily, Pearls? I heard Rifle was attracted to the smell of fish...
Pearl:
M-Mr. Nick! Are you saying I smell like fish?!
Phoenix:
Uh, maybe just a little, yes...
Pearl:
Hmm... I guess I need to change my clothes...
Phoenix:
(That's odd... I wonder why Pearls smells like she's holding a bucket of fish...?)
Buckler:
Hmm... Orla doesn't usually want to eat at this time of day... And we've even been giving her more food than normal at her regular meal times lately...
Talk
Orla's eating
Phoenix:
Is there something wrong with Orla's feeding habits lately?
Buckler:
Yeah, something's weird. The new guy, Marlon, feeds all the other animals besides Orla. But the captain and I, her trainer, are responsible for feeding Orla. It was the captain's turn to feed Orla this morning. 
Athena:
But Orla keeps coming to me and signaling she's still hungry. She wants my fish, chock-filled with love!
Phoenix:
How long are you going to keep saying that? (She sure is excited to make a new friend.)
Buckler:
But I don't think the captain would've forgotten to feed Orla...
Orla and Rifle
Pearl:
Rifle and that big creature there certainly seem to love each other!
Buckler:
This is Orla the orca. Rifle and Orla are best friends! They belong together like a clownfish and a sea anemone!
Phoenix:
(Care to phrase that in a way us non-biology majors can understand...?)
Pearl:
Oh! So this orca is the suspect. I-I read in a book once that orcas eat penguins...!
Buckler:
Don't you worry about that. Orla here's really gentle, and she never eats anything but fish.
Rifle:
*kree!* *kreeeee!*
Orla:
Fwee... Fwee, fwee...
Buckler:
She's an ol' sweetheart. As a matter of fact, she even tolerates Rifle picking on her!
Phoenix:
It's true, she does seem very gentle. She hardly seems like a "killer" whale...
Athena:
As lawyers, we have to do everything we can to save this beautiful, gentle creature!
Pearl:
Wow, you're going to defend her in court? She's... quite the defendant, isn't she...?
Phoenix:
She's the biggest defendant we've ever had. (Literally!)
Phoenix:
Oh, Pearls. I have a big favor to ask. 
Pearl:
What is it, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
It's about my Magatama... Its spiritual power seems to have vanished. 
Pearl:
Oh! That Magatama brings back memories! I remember pouring my spiritual power into it. That was so many years ago... I guess that's why it's almost out now. ...There you go, Mr. Nick. It should be fine now.
Phoenix:
Thank you, Pearls! Now I can break Psyche-Locks again. 
Pearl:
Hee hee. I'm glad I could help! Well, I think I'll go find Mr. Marlon now. I have to bring Rifle to him.
Athena:
Pearly sure seems right at home at this aquarium. 
Phoenix:
Hmm, you're right. But didn't she say this was her first time here...?
Buckler:
Apparently, that girl was in the staff corridor earlier this morning. That's why the detective was questioning her.
Phoenix:
What was Pearls doing in the staff corridor?
Buckler:
I dunno. I thought she was Marlon's friend or something.
Phoenix:
The staff corridor, huh...? Something about that doesn't sit well with me...
Orca Pool Diagram updated in the Court Record.
Athena:
Well, if it bothers you, why don't you just ask her about it?
Phoenix:
Yeah, good idea. Let's go catch up with her.

What to do
Athena:
Checking out the scene is important, but we can't forget to question people, too! We need to get some insight on how people are feeling.
Phoenix:
But we should give the scene another look, too, though. We might've missed something.
Athena:
Of course! That's one of the basic rules of investigating! "The lawyer always returns to the scene of the investigation."
Phoenix:
Wasn't that "The criminal always returns to the scene of the crime"?
Any ideas?
Athena:
There sure are a lot of interesting characters at Shipshape Aquarium! 
Phoenix:
I'll say. It's like a wild pirate ship. 
Athena:
I guess they really wanted to give the place an authentic piratey flavor. Like the sea-bottom Aqua Tunnel, and the Exploration Corner, "where pirates gather"!
Widget:
Arr! Let's have some fun, me hearties!
Athena:
Y-Yikes! Widget, you scared me!
Phoenix:
...Let's save the pirate fun for AFTER the investigation, shall we?

Athena:
Ugh. That smells awful! Please keep it away from me!

But you're the one who wanted it. Why do I have to carry it?

Orla sure eats a lot, doesn't she? I used to eat a lot when I was a kid. Took lots of naps, too!
Phoenix:
And you still take lots of naps, right here at the office.
Athena:
What?! You knew about that?! I-It's this new thing I'm trying out! Um... sleep learning! Yeah, that's the ticket!
Phoenix:
(Not buying it.)

Pearl:
Hee hee. It was my pleasure. See you again sometime, Rifle!

1 PSYCHE-LOCK
Phoenix:
Um, Pearls, why do I see a Psyche-Lock?
Pearl:
Um... I'm sorry, Mr. Nick... But I really shouldn't talk about it...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I don't really feel right about digging into Pearls's affairs... But she was here at the aquarium at the time of the incident... Whatever she's hiding could help us in court! Sorry Pearls, but I'll have to use my Magatama on you.)
Magatama
Phoenix:
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
Phoenix:
(A Psyche-Lock... A lock on a person's heart that only I can see... The deeper the secret is hidden, the more locks there will be. Pearls only has one lock, so I should be able to undo it fairly easily. But if I make a mistake, I'll be locked in a loop and won't be able to move forward. Okay, time to give it a try.)
-- Relation to Rimes --
Phoenix:
Pearls, you have to tell me about your relationship with Mr. Rimes. 
Pearl:
"Relationship"? There is no "relationship" between Mr. Marlon and me. We're just a visitor to the aquarium and an animal keeper at the aquarium, that's all. 
Phoenix:
But there are areas where ordinary "visitors to the aquarium" don't get to go... You were here before the incident occurred, weren't you? 
Present Staff corridor
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Yes! That's right..."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Pearl:
Do you have any proof I was there?
Phoenix:
Proof...? No, can't say that I do... (Hmm... I'd better give it another try...)
Leads back to:
"You were here before the incident occurred, weren't you?"
Pearl:
Yes! That's right... ...But how did you know?
Phoenix:
Someone told me you were there.
Pearl:
I got confused and went the wrong way. I didn't know it was a corridor just for the staff. But that's all it was, Mr. Nick! It didn't have anything to do with Mr. Marlon.
Phoenix:
(Sounds reasonable. I guess I'd better move on to my next topic.) Actually, there's something else I've been wondering about, Pearls... Why do you smell like fish?
Pearl:
F-Fish? Wh-What makes you think I smell like fish?
Phoenix:
Well, there's a certain someone who convinced me it wasn't my imagination. 
Present Rifle profile
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"R-Rifle...?!"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Pearl:
Is there something you want to say about that person...?
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, I guess not... (When it comes to sniffing out the smell of fish, there's only one nose that I can rely on!) Pearls, I want you to be honest with me. 
Leads back to:
"Why do you smell like fish?"
Pearl:
R-Rifle...?!
Phoenix:
She's apparently very attracted to the smell of fish. Rifle didn't want anything to do with Athena, even though she had a bunch of fish. So why then, was Rifle so attracted to you, Pearls?
Pearl:
Errr... I don't know...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Looks like she's still not ready to talk about it.) You had an object with you that smelled fishy, too. In fact, I think this has something to do with your secret.
Present Calendar
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The fishy smelling calendar has something to do with your secret, doesn't it, Pearls?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Pearl:
I'm sorry, Mr. Nick... ...but I don't see how that relates to me.
Phoenix:
(I guess that wasn't it. The key here is something that smells fishy.) Let me try that again, Pearls. 
Leads back to:
"In fact, I think this has something to do with your secret."
Phoenix:
The fishy smelling calendar has something to do with your secret, doesn't it, Pearls?

Relation to Rimes (after breaking Psyche-Lock)
Phoenix:
Please tell me about your relationship with Mr. Rimes.
Pearl:
I became distracted by the gift shop almost as soon as we got to the aquarium. Before I knew it, everyone else had moved on, and I got lost. I was so embarrassed to be lost at my age!
Phoenix:
Oh, Pearls. I know big, crowded places are hard for you.
Pearl:
I sort of panicked... and went down the wrong corridor. I ended up in the food prep room, and that's where I met Mr. Marlon. I really startled him when I called out to him. He jumped so much, he startled me, too, and I lost my balance and fell down. Oh, Mr. Nick! I spilled so many fish all over the floor!
Phoenix:
I guess that explains why you smell fishy, pardon the pun.
Pearl:
Yes. And my calendar fell off my bag and got buried in all the fish, too. 
Phoenix:
(But it doesn't explain why Pearls wanted to keep it a secret.)
Why did you hide it?
Phoenix:
Why did you want to hide your meeting with Mr. Rimes?
Pearl:
Well, I didn't want him to get in trouble over feed sanitation regulations because of me. And Mr. Marlon said he didn't want anyone to know he was in the food prep room.
Phoenix:
Huh? Why not? What was he doing in there?
Pearl:
Before I spoke to him, he was starting at a calendar. But, because of me, he dropped his calendar, too. We had to search for it among the fish.
Athena:
Wait a minute... This calendar of yours... It already has writing in it!
Pearl:
It does? But I didn't write anything in it yet!
Athena:
There's something written here under today's date. "Meet the captain at the orca pool at 7 am."
Pearl:
Maybe my calendar and Mr. Marlon's got mixed up?
Phoenix:
Pearls, about what time did you run into Mr. Rimes?
Pearl:
I think it was about 10:15 when he had the info desk announce that I was lost... So I must have first gone into the prep room at about 10:10.
Phoenix:
I see... Do you mind if I hang on to this calendar for a while? It might be a clue to the victim's movements before he was killed.
Pearl:
...All right. But be sure to give it back to Mr. Marlon later, okay?

DePlume:
You people again? You're becoming quite the nuisance. If that veterinarian won't come out, then I might just have to give up and leave.
Athena:
Veterinarian...? Is that the "Dr. Crab" Mr. Rimes was talking about?
DePlume:
You are correct. He likes to shut himself up in that back room there and won't come out. But I don't think he's even in there today, so I'm about ready to go home.
Phoenix:
(She sure seems to know a lot about the workings of this aquarium. And maybe a little something about the incident this morning, too.)

I'll do nothing of the sort! It would mean breaking my promise. 
Phoenix:
I don't know who you made this promise to... but you WILL tell me. You're not an aquarium employee, and yet, here you are, after the place has closed. That must mean you're connected to the incident involving the owner somehow.

Oh ho ho! I don't know anything about any "incident" involving the owner.

I witnessed the very moment the killer whale attacked the victim. I told the police what I saw as well. I'm the sort of person who simply can't rest until the truth is known.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... So both Ms. DePlume's statement and the footage point to Orla's guilt...)
Athena:
Hm? Pardon me, but you seem pretty pleased that you witnessed this incident...
DePlume:
What? "Pleased"? Shame on you! Are you implying that I am happy about an innocent man's death?!
Athena:
N-No, of course not! I... I just don't get the sense that you were afraid of Orla. It's more like you were... interested in her.
DePlume:
Are you...? You know, I wasn't sure, but I was thinking that maybe... Are you perhaps one of my fans? Is that how you knew... ...that I am THE nonfiction writer, Norma DePlume?!
Athena:
Oh! THAT Norma DePlume!
Phoenix:
So... big fan, huh?
Athena:
No! I've never even heard of her!
DePlume:
Well, now that you've figured me out, there's no sense in trying to hide who I am, I suppose. Talking to fans is part of a writer's duty, after all! Oh ho ho!
Athena:
B-But I'm not a fan, I tell you...
Non-fiction writer (appears after "Why you're here")
Phoenix:
So what exactly have you written, Ms. DePlume?
DePlume:
Oh, my. You mean to say you truly aren't familiar with my work? I write the truth. I take great pride in my craft, you know. I've been gathering information on Orla the killer whale for a year now. I've been very worried about Orla's violent tendencies... And today, my concern was proven to be well justified!
Athena:
Orla isn't violent! She's a sweet and gentle soul!
DePlume:
Oh ho ho! The moment you let your guard down with that killer whale... CHOMP! Shipshape Aquarium has always denied the killer whale's violent streak. But it has been rumored to attack people...
Athena:
But rumors are just rumors! They aren't necessarily true!
DePlume:
Yes, I realize that. But I only write the truth. That is why I questioned the owner directly. But he refused to allow my research, and he even had the audacity to say to me: "You're nothing but a nuisance, coming here day after day. Don't ever come back again!"
Phoenix:
(It sounds like her "research" was a bit too much to take...)
Athena:
But then... how did you get in here if you've been blacklisted?
DePlume:
I have my methods. Oh ho ho!
Phoenix:
(This lady is shameless.)
Orla's violent streak
Athena:
We won't let you speak badly of Orla! We're going to defend her!
DePlume:
I'm only stating what I saw with my very own eyes. I came to the aquarium today to observe the killer whale. But on my way to that thing's tank, I heard its cries. 
Athena:
You can hear Orla from the visitor's corridor?
DePlume:
There are speakers there in the corridor, up near the ceiling. Apparently, that speaker is there so visitors can hear the killer whale's sounds. In any case, as I approached the killer whale's tank, I heard its cries. And when I arrived, I saw something terrifying.
Phoenix:
What did you see?
DePlume:
The killer whale stealing the Swashbuckler Spectacular hat the owner was wearing... ...and then, the moment it bit him and shook him mercilessly to death within its jaws!
Athena:
Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!
Phoenix:
Orla... bit the owner to death...?!
Fulbright:
In justice we trust! So I take it Ms. DePlume's just finished telling you what she saw?
Phoenix:
D-Detective Fulbright! I guess you've already heard it, too?
Fulbright:
Yup, when we took her statement earlier. As you heard, I'm afraid that accidental death is really the only thing it could be.
DePlume:
Yes! And a dangerous creature like that cannot be allowed to harm anyone ever again!
Phoenix:
B-But she's not dangerous!
Fulbright:
Sorry, but the Prosecutor's Office said the case didn't have enough merit to go to trial. There was one prosecutor, though, who expressed an interest in the case... 
Phoenix:
Really?! Then could we have that prosecutor take a look at the investigation reports?
Fulbright:
Unfortunately, I doubt even he'd take action without evidence of a homicide... Look, I understand how you feel, Mr. Lawyer, but maybe you should give up on this one?
Phoenix:
Not a chance. We'll just re-examine the crime scene and strengthen our case.
Fulbright:
Well, if that's your version of justice, I won't stop you. 
Athena:  
And we won't rest until we find proof it wasn't "accidental death," Detective! You'll see! Let's go, Mr. Wright! Time to check out that crime scene one more time!
July 20
Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool
Athena:
All right, then! Let's start the re-examination! Pronto! I'm going to go check out that mess in the back one more time!
Phoenix:
Athena! Wait! No running!
Athena:
Aaaaaaaaagh!
Phoenix:
A-Are you okay? (It didn't look like she tripped, but...)
Athena:
*groan* I slipped.
Orla:
Fweet!
Phoenix:
Huh? Orla? What is it, girl?
Athena:
Aaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
Athena! Are you all right?! (She crashed into all that stuff behind her.)
Athena:
*groan* I tried to get out of the way, but all I did was slip and fall... again... 
Phoenix:
That was a pretty amazing wipeout. Are you hurt?
Athena:
I'm okay... But why did Orla spike that ball at me? After all the fish I gave her, I thought she liked me... 
Phoenix:
Maybe she thought you were the main entrée?
Athena:
Very funny, Boss!
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. In any case, let's give the ball back to Orla.
Athena:
Huh? Looks like everything got shifted around when I fell on it.
Phoenix:
Hey, you're right. There are things now that we couldn't see before. (Like another ball. I guess Orla really likes them.)
Athena:
Look! There's something new by the outline of the body, too!
Phoenix:
We'd better take a good look around.
Examine
Ball
Phoenix:
Orla sure can hit that ball hard!
Athena:
I didn't think she was gonna spike it at me like that. I guess that must mean she likes me! I gladly accept her expression of affection!
Phoenix:
...Not how I would've interpreted that, but whatever floats your boat.
Octopus leg
Phoenix:
Looks like we just found that giant octopus prop's missing leg. 
Athena:
Wow. I bet you could get a whole lot of Carpaccio from a giant leg like that! Ooh, let's go to the ocean and try and catch a giant octopus of our own!
Phoenix:
Yeah, but even if we did catch one, how are you planning to slice it up?
Athena:
Kein Problem! That's what man invented chainsaws for!
Phoenix:
(I've never seen anyone so hell-bent on chomping down some giant octopus...)    Well, I doubt we could catch one that big anywhere near the shore, anyway...
Athena:
The more roadblocks you throw up, the more I want to do it, you know. Ooh, I can't wait to get started!
Phoenix:
(It would appear that Operation Discourage Insanity has backfired...)
Footsteps
Athena:
Hey, look at this mark on the floor. What do you suppose it is?
Buckler:
That's where we stand when we want to play volleyball with Orla. 
Phoenix:
Volleyball, huh?
Buckler:
Yeah. If we stand there, she'll spike the ball right at us.
Athena:
So when Orla spiked the ball at me earlier... ...that was one of her tricks?! It doesn't mean she hates me?!
Buckler:
Nah! She wanted to play with you! She loves volleyball. She used to play with the captain all the time...
Athena:
Aw... Sasha looks so sad... 
Buckler:
Okay, time to snap out of it! This is no time to be all dejected and mopey like a blobfish!
Athena:
That's right! Time to put on a smile and stay strong, right?
Phoenix:
(What's a blobfish? ...Or do I not want to know...)
Bloody coin
Phoenix:
What's this? A coin...?
Athena:
M-Mr. Wright! There's blood on it!
Phoenix:
You're right! But it's dried. 
Athena:
Do you think it could be the victim's? And what was it doing all the way over here in the first place?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I'm not sure, but now that we've found blood outside the pool... ...it just might help us prove that there's more to this case than just "accidental death."
Athena:
Hey, you're right! Orla certainly can't leave the pool, after all!
Bloodstained Coin added to the Court Record.   
Phoenix:
Speaking of coins, take a look at this. There are a few coins around the body here, too. 
Athena:
You're right, Boss! But where did they go? They aren't here anymore. You don't think somebody picked them up, do you?
Broken sword
Phoenix:
There's a broken sword here.
Athena:
Hmm... The tip of the blade is missing. Guess it just broke off. 
Phoenix:
(Don't tell me it happened when Athena fell over...?)
Athena:
You'd better not be trying to pin the blame on me, Boss!
Phoenix:
What?! N-No! Of course not!
Athena:
No use trying to hide it. It's written all over your face! Besides, the broken part isn't even here. How could it have been my fault?!
Phoenix:
(I'd better watch what I think or I'll get every little thing thrown back in my face.)
Dummy
Athena:
Oh no! That child is hurt!
Phoenix:
What?! Call an ambulance-- Hey, it's just a dummy.
Athena:
I-It is?! Oh, I mean, of course it is! I was just testing your response to an emergency.
Phoenix:
Well, I guess we just found that you don't bluff well under pressure.
Athena:
Grr! I guess I'll just have to keep practicing, then! I wonder what the dummy is for, anyway?
Buckler:
Oh, that? We use it to train Orla. It's smaller than a human, but it does the job. Some of our tricks can be pretty dangerous, so Orla practices them on the dummy first.
Phoenix:
(Forget the tricks, those bite marks look pretty dangerous...)
Phoenix:
Hey, Sasha? Would you happen to know anything about this coin?
Buckler:
Oh, I guess I missed one. I just finished cleaning up the rest of them.
Phoenix:
You picked up all of the coins already?
Buckler:
That's right. After the police finished their investigation, they gave me the go-ahead. I haven't found them all yet, though. I'm still missing a few.
Athena:
Well, if they aren't beside the pool, maybe they're IN the pool. Let's go to that ladder over there and take a peek at the bottom of the pool, Boss!
Examine
Ladder (front or right view)
Phoenix:
(I can't see anything from here. I'll have to take a look when I'm by the ladder...)
Bottom of the pool
Phoenix:
Look! I think I see something on the bottom of the pool.
Athena:
Hee hee! I knew it! Want me to go down and check?
Phoenix:
You can't jump in dressed like that! You'll drown under the weight of your clothes! 
Athena:
No, I won't! I'm a pretty good swimmer, you know! 
Phoenix
...Be that as it may, that pool's really deep. I doubt you can hold your breath that long. But maybe Sasha can...?
Buckler:
Whew! Phoenix! Look at all these coins I found at the bottom! 
Phoenix:
Thanks, Sasha. So there really were more of them down there, huh?
Athena:
We seem to be finding them all over. I wonder how many there are all together?
Buckler:
Including the ones I put away, there are 300 of them. They're for the show.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Sounds like they'd be heavy.
Buckler:
About seven pounds, I'd say. A little lighter than a stringfish. Well, I'd better go put these coins away where they belong!
Athena:
So, seven pounds of coins, scattered around the scene, one of them with blood on it... They have to be related to the case!
Phoenix:
(I wonder how the blood got on that one coin? Wait a minute. Could it be...?) Remember how Detective Fulbright said that they couldn't find a murder weapon? Well, what if these coins were the weapon?
Athena:
Huh? How could a little coin kill a grown man?
Phoenix:
Well, one coin by itself isn't much of a threat, but... 300 coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is...
Freeze them
Phoenix:
I bet a frozen lump of coins would make for a pretty good weapon. 
Athena:
But wouldn't it make more sense to freeze just the water into a block of ice? That way, there'd be no evidence of it ever existing once it melted. 
Phoenix:
...I guess you're right. (But, wait a minute. There IS another way to bundle coins together!)   
Leads back to:
"300 coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is..."
Put them in a bag
Leads to:
"If you put seven pounds of coins in a bag and swung it at somebody..."
Throw them
Phoenix:
I bet you could kill a man if you threw them hard enough. 
Athena:
Hmm... I dunno about that. I think they'd just bounce off. Besides, how could you throw them that hard all at once?
Phoenix:
Yeah... (Wait a minute...! Maybe there IS a way to bundle them all together...)   
Leads back to:
"300 coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is..."
Phoenix:
If you put seven pounds of coins in a bag and swung it at somebody... ...it would make a pretty formidable blunt instrument, wouldn't it? It would explain how blood got on this coin.
Athena:
Oh, I get it! If that bag of coins is the weapon, then we can use it to prove Orla's innocence! 
Bloodstained Coin updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
But I don't see anything resembling a coin bag around here.
Athena:
Maybe the killer took it with them.
Phoenix:
Yeah, it would certainly make it look like Orla did it if they did...
Athena:
You know what I think, Mr. Wright?! The bloody coin alone should be enough to prove this might have been a murder!
Phoenix:
I agree. It shows the possibility of a human killer rather than Orla.
Athena:
Yes! This is just what we needed! Let's go show this coin to Detective Fulbright and Ms. DePlume right away!
Phoenix:  
Good idea. Let's hope they're still at the Pub O' Danger.
July 20
Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger
Fulbright:
Oh, you're back! So did you find anything?
DePlume:
Of course he didn't!
Fulbright:
Remember, even if you don't succeed, it's the effort you make that's important!
Phoenix:
(Is he trying to console me?)
Athena:
Let's show them the evidence we found! The one that points to a human culprit!
Phoenix:
Right. Because we won't let Orla be put down.
Present
Bloodstained Coin
Phoenix:
Please take a look at this bloodstained coin.
DePlume:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! C-Cease and desist, at once! Wh-What kind of a man shows a lady blood?
Phoenix:
Urk. (She doesn't have to get so worked up...) 
Fulbright:
What are you terrorizing this lady with?! Come on, now. Let's see it.
Phoenix:
We found this coin beside the orca pool.
Fulbright:
We did see a large number of coins beside the pool, but not one with blood on it!
Phoenix:
We just learned that there's 300 of these, weighing about seven pounds all together. Now, what do you suppose would happen if a person was assaulted with that many coins?
Fulbright:
What?! So you're saying the coins might've been used like some kind of blunt weapon?!
Phoenix:
If the blood belong to the victim, then yes, it's entirely possible!
Fulbright:
Hmm... But I wouldn't call it decisive proof that the real culprit was human... 
Phoenix:
Y-You wouldn't?! Why not?!
Fulbright:
Because there'd have to be something to put the coins in to make them into a weapon. Without that "something", it's just not going to be enough to pass muster. But I will say that your theory does seem to warrant further investigation. I'll call the Prosecutor's Office and ask to reinvestigate from a possible criminal angle.
Phoenix:
...You will?! Thank you very much!
Athena:
I really hope Detective Fulbright can convince them...
Fulbright:
Hmmmm... You won't believe the answer I got. When I explained your passion for this case, and the police's investigation... ...they said that the prosecutor I mentioned earlier would be willing to take this to court.
Phoenix:
Really?! So does that mean a new suspect has emerged?
Fulbright:
No, I'm afraid not... To be frank... ...Prosecutor Blackquill said he just wants to prove that orca's guilt in court!
Athena:
WHAAAAAAAT?! It's Prosecutor Blackquill that wants to prosecute Orla?!
Phoenix:
...That's fine, Detective. Thanks for arranging this for us.
Fulbright:
Well, I must say you're taking this rather calmly.
Phoenix:
Defending Orla in court was my idea from the start. And I'll do whatever it takes to save her.
Fulbright:
Hmm... In that case, I'll do whatever I can as well to see that justice is served. Ms. DePlume, will you be a witness for the prosecution?
DePlume:
A trial for a killer whale? I've never heard of such recklessness before in my life! But I will reveal the truth about this killer whale, and then write all about it!
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Sounds like a plan! Now, if you'll just come along with me... We have to prepare for tomorrow, and I still have to arrange for an autopsy.
DePlume:
Oh ho ho! I look forward to tomorrow! Until then, blue lawyer and yellow fan.
Athena:
I AM NOT A FAN!
Phoenix:
...Well, at least we managed to get the case to go to trial.
Athena:
But how in the world do we defend an orca in court, anyway?
Phoenix:
To be honest, I'm not really sure myself.
Athena:
Plus, Ms. DePlume said Orla bit the victim... This trial sure isn't going to be easy... ...but I love a challenge!
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. Then we ought to be just fine. Guess I should go over that Swashbuckler Spectacular you were watching this morning. 
Athena:
Yeah! We can have a formal viewing back at the office!
Phoenix:  
(There's nothing decisive against Orla in the security tape, but that doesn't mean much. I'll just have to find a more concrete way to save Orla at tomorrow's trial or else!)
To Be Continued
Orca Pool (before presenting evidence to Norma DePlume):
Examine
Ladder
Phoenix:
(I guess I've seen enough of the inside the pool... [sic] but maybe just one more look.)
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
Nothing particularly interesting here.
Exit Magatama session
Phoenix:
(I think I have enough evidence, but maybe I should do a bit more thinking first...)
