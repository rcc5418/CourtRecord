Part 2
April 6, 2:52 PMOutside Grand TowerTemporary Film Lot
Powers:
Uh, umm. Could you please give it a rest already?
Lotta:
The heck? I'm tellin' y'all, it's best for all y'alls sake to come clean!
Nicole:
The staff has their lips sealed shut as the reporters continue their tenacious negotiations!
Officer:
...If you're not here to cooperate with the investigation, I must ask you to vacate the premises.
Lotta:
...Put a sock in it, copper! Y'all couldn't even stop Moozilla's invasion!
Nicole:
Not only did they secretly raise a giant monster, but now the staff is tryin' to cover it up...?
Penny:
Like I said, we haven't been raising any monsters here at the film lot!
Lotta:
But ain't ya said ya done saw Gourdy yerself!?
Penny:
Sure, I saw it... but it's not like we were keeping it at the film lot!
???:
Mind if we butt in?
Penny:
Ah! Mr. Edgeworth!
Powers:
And John...!
Lotta:
Oh! Y'all come here to search for the monster too?
Lang:
We're searching for a criminal, not a monster. Lang Zi says: "The darkness inside a criminal's heart can be likened to a monster!" Well, when it comes to killing people, criminals aren't much different from monsters.
Officer:
A-Agent Lang! This is a problem! I can't let outsiders enter the crime scene...!
Lang:
These are all key figures in the case. I'd like them to be here when the investigation resumes.
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. Regarding what you said about resuming the investigation... Where do you intend to start?
Lang:
We'll start by reviewing the case. Today, the body of President Huang was found here at the film lot. The president's whereabouts from two nights ago are still unknown.
Edgeworth:
It seems he snuck out from under the eyes of his bodyguards and ventured outside.
Lang:
And that night was the last time he was seen alive. It was when he met with you, Judge Courtney, on the roof of the Grand Tower.
John:
!
Courtney:
......
Lang:
So, why did you meet with the president?
Courtney:
That... I cannot say.
Edgeworth:
(You can't tell us, even under suspicion of murder?)
John:
...Can't say? Why not?
Kay:
Ms. Courtney! If you don't say anything, you'll be more suspicious!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hah! She must have a reason to clam up! I think you're somehow involved in the president's assassination.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The president's body was only discovered today. That still leaves a blank of one whole day after Judge Courtney met with him unaccounted for!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Don't be so impatient. We're gonna fill in that blank right here, right now. The evening on that blank day in question is what's important... What happened here last night? So, why don't you tell us? John Marsh!
John:
Me?
Lang:
We know you were here last night.
Courtney:
Wh-What... John was... here?
Lang:
Between that little missy's testimony and the footprints we found, we can easily prove it.
Penny:
John, you were rehearsing here last night, right?
John:
...You were spying on me?
Penny:
Ah, umm, I'm sorry. I just came to check up on things. You really shouldn't be staying up so late, you know...
John:
Mind your own business.
Courtney:
John Marsh! That young lady was worried about you. You will not speak to her like that!
John:
.......Sorry.
Courtney:
How many times have I told you to be more mindful of the way you speak?
Kay:
It is just me, or does Ms. Courtney's personality seem kind of different?
Edgeworth:
She seems to be as strict with her own son as she is with those who violate the law.
Courtney:
Are you listening to me? And earlier, as well...
John:
.....
Courtney:
You should always bear that in mind, no matter the occasion...
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
...Can we get on with the investigation already?
Courtney:
Ah! ...Pardon me.
Edgeworth:
(For Judge Courtney to get carried away like that... This must be her motherly side.) Agent Lang. Do you suspect John?
Lang:
All I want is the truth. Why was the president killed...? And I want to know who killed him... I'll do whatever it takes to find out.
Edgeworth:
(It seems the president was like family to him...) John... Would it be alright if we asked you a few questions?
John:
...Sure. It's fine. I've got nothing to hide anyway.
-- John's Rehearsal --
John:
I wasn't feeling too great during yesterday's shoot, so I made a few bloopers.
They're reshooting the scene today, so...
Well, I decided to rehearse a little on my own. That's all.
I do it all the time. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary.
Courtney:
You were rehearsing alone that late at night...? John. When I called you last night, you told me you were at the hotel...
Edgeworth:
You called him? About what time was that?
Courtney:
I believe it was around 11 PM. I require him to call me every night. That's our rule whenever he stays away from home.
John:
...The truth is, I was at the film lot during that time.
Courtney:
So you lied to me...!
John:
.......... I'm sorry.
Kay:
Ms. Courtney sure is angry. I think it's admirable that he practiced on his own, even if he hid it from his mom.
Edgeworth:
I'm sure she was simply worried. Who knows what could have happened to him, out alone so late at night? And in reality, he did get caught up in yesterday's incident...
Kay:
But John said, "there wasn't anything out of the ordinary", right?
Edgeworth:
(Is that really the truth?)
Rebuttal
-- John's Rehearsal --
John:
I wasn't feeling too great during yesterday's shoot, so I made a few bloopers.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
John. You said you didn't feel well. Could you tell me more concretely what was wrong?
John:
That doesn't matter! I just wasn't feeling well, alright!?
Kay:
You weren't feeling well... Maybe you drank too much milk?
John:
Wha... How'd you...!? Ah, no, I mean, that's not it...
Edgeworth:
(So he didn't feel well because of his stomach...)
Kay:
When I was young, I was told that chewing milk makes it easier on your stomach, y'know?
John:
Th-This conversation is over! Anyways, I made a few bloopers.
John:
They're reshooting the scene today, so...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So they planned to reshoot the scene today. And you were practicing for that last night.
John:
...My mistakes caused a lot of trouble for the people around me. I'm a pro, so practicing that much more is natural.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... He certainly does have an admirable sense of responsibility.)
Penny:
John is incredibly dedicated to his craft. He didn't even make any major mistakes in those bloopers. But he said if it would make the movie just a tiny bit better...
John:
Shut up! You don't need to go around blabbering about stupid stuff like that!
Penny:
Ah... I-I'm sorry.
Edgeworth:
(If only he was a little more cooperative, I'd have no complaints.)
John:
Hmph... Anyway, that's what happened.
John:
Well, I decided to rehearse a little on my own. That's all.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
John. About your testimony just now...
Courtney:
John Marsh! Don't I always tell you!? If you're going to practice by yourself, you have to let me know beforehand!
John:
I-I-I know!
Edgeworth:
(...My time to speak was completely stolen away from me.) I shall ask you once more. John, about your testimony just now...
Kay:
But you know, John, I think that's really great!
Edgeworth:
(Mmph... A-Again!?)
Kay:
I bet putting in an honest effort like that will make someone even more talented. You'll go from a little thief to a Middle Thief, and then someday you'll become a Great Thief! I'll be doing my best, so you do your best too! OK, John?
Edgeworth:
........Ahem. Now then, if I may? John. Do you often rehearse in that way? (At last... At long last, I finally got to ask my question...!)
John:
I do it all the time. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
There are no mistakes in that testimony, correct?
John:
O-Of course there's no mistakes! It was just a normal, peaceful night! Nothing out of the ordinary happened at all!
Kay:
A... A peaceful night!? How can you say that when an incident like this has occurred!?
Edgeworth:
Kay, he is still a child. Please don't get seriously angry.
Present Moozilla's Head
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that?
John:
...! I don't know anything about it.
Edgeworth:
Is that true?
John:
I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something?
Edgeworth:
(...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after John had already gone back...)
John:
If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
We're not done talking yet!
John:
What now?
Edgeworth:
The falling monster's head wasn't the only unusual thing that happened last night. And this is something you should be well aware of. What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling?
Present Monster's Footprints or John's Practice Video
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"We have evidence right here."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
John. Take a look at this.
John:
And what's that supposed to be?
Edgeworth:
Don't you understand? This shows what happened last night.
John:
......
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Have I left you speechless?
John:
...You're so far off the mark that I have nothing to say.
Edgeworth:
Argh! (Was I really that far off...?)
Kay:
Let's review what happened here last night one more time!
Edgeworth:
Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer!
Kay:
Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night?
Leads back to:
"What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling?"
Edgeworth:
We have evidence right here.
John:
Ah! Could that be...!?
Edgeworth:
That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance.
John:
........Ugh.
Lang:
What!? You're telling me you have video from last night!?
Edgeworth:
Exactly. And in this video... ...there is clearly something that is out of the ordinary.
Lang:
Th-This is... a monster's footprint...!
Edgeworth:
Would you say that monster's footprints are commonplace on a film set?
Courtney:
John... Why did you conceal this video from us?
John:
........No reason, really.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hey, pup! This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right?
Courtney:
John Marsh! Answer him clearly!
John:
But Mom.....
Edgeworth:
Well?
John:
...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing.
Lang:
........
Kay:
........
Edgeworth:
........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice.
John:
...Yeah. Got a problem with that!?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
You're saying that's why you hid the evidence?
Courtney:
John!
John:
Eep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home.
Hold it!
Lotta:
How come yer so calm after findin' those footprints!? It's a monster, ya know!? A real live monster!
John:
...I thought it was just a part of the set. Besides, there's lots of other weird stuff around here too.
Nicole:
He's suspicious, Chief! This kid's really suspicious!
Lotta:
Yer right! The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven!
John:
...Shut up. We're done talking!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Leads to:
"Wait up..."

Edgeworth:
We're not done here yet!
John:
What now?
Edgeworth:
The monster's footprints weren't the only unusual things that happened last night. Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night?
Present Moozilla's Head
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"A monster's head fell from the roof of that building."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This shows what happened here yesterday.
John:
...And just what exactly does it show?
Edgeworth:
You don't understand, do you? You are still a child, after all.
John:
I don't need some guy who's less intelligent than a child telling me that.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (It seems that wasn't it...)
Kay:
Let's review what happened here last night one more time!
Edgeworth:
Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer!

John:
If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking!
Edgeworth:
(It seems that John doesn't really want to talk about last night. Could he be hiding something after all...?)
Leads to:
"Wait up..."
Edgeworth:
So there was nothing out of the ordinary...?
Kay:
He doesn't know anything at all about the incident. That's the impression I'm getting. But isn't there evidence that shows something did happen last night?
Edgeworth:
Yes... I don't have time to waste dealing with a child's lies. Let's present the contradiction.
Lang:
Wait up...
Edgeworth:
? Agent Lang?
Lang:
Heh heh heh. It's as I thought. Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. This video backs up my logic.
Kay:
Huh!? Is there something in the video that's related to the case?
Lang:
Yeah... Take a good, hard look at the monster costume in the top-left.
Kay:
The Moozilla costume...?
Lang:
Try comparing it with the one over there right now.
Kay:
Hmm? It looks like it's just hanging there limply though. And the zipper on its back is zipped up tightly.
Edgeworth:
(Zipper on its back...?) Wha! (Th-This discrepancy is...!)
Lang:
Yeah. The difference is plain to see. In the video, the zipper is clearly open! That's right... Someone was inside.
Kay:
WHAAAAAAAT!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Powers! Is the costume's zipper usually...?
Powers:
It's always zipped up tightly when it's not in use...
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. Do you remember? My logic from before...
Lang:
Two nights ago, Courtney pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body.
Edgeworth:
In here?
Lang:
Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body.
Edgeworth:
You're saying the body... was hidden inside the costume?
Lang:
Yeah, that's right! Judge Courtney! Two nights ago, you pushed the president off the roof of the tower. You then hid the body inside the monster costume!
Courtney:
I... I did no such thing!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Say what you want, but you're the only one who could've done it!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That should have already been proven impossible. The film lot was locked at the time! Judge Courtney could not have entered this place!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
...And what if there was an accomplice?
Edgeworth:
What?
Lang:
I'll tell you my reasoning, so listen up.
-- Mother and Son Theory --
Lang:
When the president was pushed off the roof, John was waiting at the film lot.
If John was an accomplice, the problem with the locks would be resolved.
The two of them then hid the president's body.
Inside that monster costume over there...
Edgeworth:
You think this crime had such an elaborate plan?
Lang:
To take the life of a nation's president. An elaborate plan is to be expected, don't you think?
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
John would never... take part in such a crime!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
You're the one being suspected. Your words don't carry much weight!
Edgeworth:
I wouldn't think those two had sufficient motive for something like this, though?
Lang:
Well, maybe they had a motive that we didn't know about? You were the last one to meet with the president. And you're still keeping the details secret. Don't you think it's only natural that you're being suspected?
Courtney:
......
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Is there no way for you to tell us your secret.
Courtney:
M-My apologies. I just cannot, no matter what... However, when the time I can talk about it comes, I will surely let you know. So, if you could please...
Lang:
Believe you? Is that what you wanted to say? That's what all criminals say. And you, pup... If you've got an explanation, hurry up and spit it out.
John:
Hmph. I didn't do nothing. ...That's all I'm saying.
Lang:
Both mother and son won't talk. You still gonna defend 'em like this?
Edgeworth:
It's true, Judge Courtney's actions are a mystery... ...however, we still don't know whether or not that ties in with a motive for murder.
Lang:
Yeah, that's right. Their motive for murder can wait. For now, let's talk about the situation surrounding the crime. ...And the fact that these two are the only ones who could've done it!
Rebuttal

Lang:
When the president was pushed off the roof, John was waiting at the film lot.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. Don't tell me you're saying John was an accomplice?
Kay:
John still looks like a grade school kid, he's even got a kiddy backpack to boot! How could he be an accomplice...? There's just no way!
Penny:
Like I said, John's already in middle school, and the backpack is a part of his costume...
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Lang Zi says! "No matter how young the cub, never pity an ungrateful pup." He may be a little brat, but a villain deserves no mercy.
Kay:
Uuuh... So Mr. Lang Zi didn't make any allowances for age...
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. You're not just defending him 'cause he's a pup, are you?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Of course, that was never my intention. I shall present suitable evidence in due course.
Lang:
Oh? I'm looking forward to it. My logic's just getting started.
Lang:
If John was an accomplice, the problem with the locks would be resolved.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
How would that... resolve the problem!?
Lang:
I figured you'd ask that, Mr. Prosecutor. But y'know, it's actually quite simple. Listen up... First, that woman pushes the president off the roof.
Kay:
Hmm... she pushes him off.
Lang:
Then, that brat, who knew the combination for the lock, unlocks the film lot.
Kay:
I see... the combination unlocks the brat!
Edgeworth:
Kay, it's the opposite.
Lang:
...That's all it takes. With this, the problem of the lock is solved. Your theory that she couldn't get in because she didn't know the combination no longer files!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... Regarding the lock, that certainly is a plausible explanation...) Agent Lang. Thank you for your clear explanation. Please, continue with what you were saying before.
Lang:
Hmph. If you're gonna give up, you better do it now.
Lang:
The two of them then hid the president's body.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Supposing those two were accomplices... Why would they have needed to leave the body hanging there for an entire day!?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Why don't you give it a rest, and take a good hard look at reality. Thanks to their trickery, our investigation has been confused up until now. Doesn't that about answer your question!? ...Got it? Those two hid the body.
Lang:
Inside that monster costume over there...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
In the video, we cannot see the inside of the costume. So can you really say for certain that the body was placed inside?
Lang:
...Yeah, I'll give you that much. In that case, why don't we try examining it? The inside of that costume! There might be some traces left inside.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Powers, may we examine the inside of the costume?
Powers:
Sure. Go ahead. But it might be kinda stinky, since I sweat a lot in here...
Edgeworth:
This is... incredibly dirty.
Powers:
That's strange... We always make sure to clean it after using it, so that the sweat doesn't damage the costume.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Isn't this just proof that someone besides you used this costume? I'd say that dirt from the body probably got into the costume.
Kay:
The president's body did fall on top of the monster's footprint. That must be where the dirt came from!
Lang:
...Are you satisfied now?
Add statement:
"There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside."
Lang:
There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, dirt got into the costume when the body was hidden inside. Wouldn't that mean... ...that the dirt was transferred from the body?
Lang:
Hah! Isn't that obvious? How else would you say it got there?
Kay:
...There's dirt stuck everywhere inside the costume. It looks particularly bad around the chest area.
Edgeworth:
(Dirt around the chest...? We cannot overlook this fact.)
Present Crime Scene Notes
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it..."
Kay:
Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense...
Edgeworth:
Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point.
Kay:
In that case, what should we do?
Edgeworth:
Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail. Let's draw out more information.
Edgeworth:
Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it... Is that really the case?
Lang:
You have a problem with that?
Edgeworth:
There is a fair amount of dirt inside the front of the costume.
Kay:
Yeah, that IS a lot of dirt...
Edgeworth:
However, I would like you to focus on the state the body is in. It's lying on top of the dirt, and yet there's no dirt on the front of the body. If the body really was inside the costume... ...then it's strange that the front of the body isn't stained with more dirt!
Lang:
Rrgh! Well then, how would you explain it? How did the dirt get inside the costume!?
Edgeworth:
(From the video footage, it's very likely that someone was inside the costume. But just who could it have been...?)
Kay:
Hmm... Where have I seen this?
Edgeworth:
What's the matter, Kay?
Kay:
I just feel like I remember seeing something that looked like this dirt somewhere before... ...but where was it? There were these bits of gray fragments mixed in with the dirt.
Edgeworth:
(Gray... fragments? There does seem to be something other than normal dirt mixed into it...)
Kay:
Something must've gotten stuck to it, and lots of it I might add. Hmm...
Edgeworth:
(Something got stuck to it? This may merit a closer look. Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?)
Present Mechanic's Gloves
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is what you're thinking of, isn't it, Kay?
Kay:
Oh! Mr. Edgeworth, you sure are sharp!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Naturally.
Kay:
...But too bad! Not this time!
Edgeworth:
Argh! (You should have just said that in the first place!)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, can't you remember? Dirt, dirt... Where else did we see this dirt?
Edgeworth:
(Dirt... Wasn't there a piece of evidence that had dirt on it?)
Kay:
It's on the tip of my brain, but I just can't quite place it. Where on earth have we seen dirt like this before?
Leads back to:
"(Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?)"
Edgeworth:
This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it.
Lang:
Huh? And what of it?
Edgeworth:
We found an item belonging to a certain man, that was covered in the same type of dirt. That is to say, these gloves.
Lang:
Those dirt stains... certainly look the same. But, tell me... Just what exactly is this grey substance!?
Edgeworth:
This grey substance is...
Plastic
Edgeworth:
Yes, I believe it's plastic. Your thoughts?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hah! You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Prosecutor! Put more "BANG!" into your claims, like you usually do!
Edgeworth:
Ah... Hmm.
Lang:
As for my opinion on the matter... I'll tell you right now, that stuff is definitely not plastic!
Edgeworth:
Nngwaaah! (So that wasn't it...)
Kay:
Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it?
Edgeworth:
Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally.
Leads back to:
"This grey substance is..."
Concrete
Leads to:
"This grey substance must be fragments of concrete."
Paint
Edgeworth:
No matter how you look at it, this must be paint!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor! When did you become so scatterbrained!? No matter how you look at it, this doesn't look like paint!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (I suppose not...)
Kay:
Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it?
Edgeworth:
Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally.
Leads back to:
"This grey substance is..."
Edgeworth:
This grey substance must be fragments of concrete.
Kay:
You mean... the stuff that was scattered around the monster's footprints?
Edgeworth:
Exactly. Meanwhile, who do these gloves, which are stained with the same kind of dirt, belong to?
Kay:
Oh, I remember! We found it at Blaise's place!
Edgeworth:
Earlier today, we went to Blaise's garage. There, we discovered these dirt-stained gloves. Come to think of it, there were also hammers, shovels, and other tools placed inside, as well. Why would mechanic's gloves, intended to be used on machines, be covered in dirt? If he broke the concrete with the hammer, and then dug into the soil with the shovel... ...then it's only natural for dirt like that to get on the gloves.
Kay:
Then, maybe...!
Edgeworth:
Yes. The true nature of the monster's footprints... has been made clear. It's possible that these footprints were dug up by Blaise Debeste himself.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
It's possible...? Hmph! It's possible, you say!? Please do enlighten me. 'Cuz I honestly have no clue! Why on earth would he do something like that?
Edgeworth:
(Why did he make the monster footprints? Thinking about it, the answer must be...)
He was digging something up
Edgeworth:
It's possible he was digging something up.
Leads to:
"It probably went something like this."
He buried something
Edgeworth:
Could it have been because he buried something?
Kay:
He buried something!? I smell treasure! So, what did he bury?
Edgeworth:
If we want to find that out, we'll have to dig it up ourselves.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
You think the police wouldn't have already investigated that? There was absolutely nothing buried beneath those footprints!
Edgeworth:
Nngwaaah! (It seems that was wrong...) In that case, we should assume the opposite: he dug something up.
Leads to:
"It probably went something like this."
Edgeworth:
It probably went something like this. Last night at this spot, there was something that Blaise needed to dig up. For that reason, he broke the lock on the back door ans sneaked into the film lot... Using the hammer and shovel, he set to work. He placed the items he dug up into his bag, but before he could fill in the holes...
Kay:
Ah! That's when John came to practice!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. Blaise panicked, and had no choice but to hide himself in the Moozilla costume nearby.
Lang:
Grr... To think you would deduce so much from just a pair of dirt-stained gloves... However! All of this is merely a possibility! There's still no proof that he was the one who was hiding inside that costume! For all we know, he might've left the scene once he finished digging!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
On the contrary. Such proof does exist, and can be seen... in the video. When this video was recorded, Blaise was definitely inside the film lot.
Lang:
Whaaaaat!?
Edgeworth:
(Though I can't blame Agent Lang for not noticing... ...the difference between the current flim lot... ...and the one in John's video. Along with the state of Blaise's garage... ...it's all too clear that Blaise was still here!) What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded?
Present duffel bag beside monster costume
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This bag placed near the costume..."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This proves that Blaise was still at the film lot!
Kay:
Umm... How exactly does it prove that?
Lang:
Yeah, I'd like a better explanation as well!
Edgeworth:
...Argh! (So this has nothing to do with Blaise...)
Kay:
If something belonging to Blaise could be seen in this video, then proving it would be easy... Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything that comes to mind?
Edgeworth:
(Something belonging to Blaise... Does anything like that appear in the video?)
Lang:
Well, Mr. Prosecutor!? How about it...? Is there really any evidence that Blaise Debeste was there?
Edgeworth:
There's no need to rush, Agent Lang.
Leads back to:
"What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded?"
Edgeworth:
This bag placed near the costume... There was an identical one inside Blaise's garage.
Lang:
!
Edgeworth:
First, the dirt on the gloves, and now the bag... It seems there is a connection.
Mechanic's Gloves data updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
And that's my proof. Blaise was inside the costume. Ergo, the president's body could not have been hidden inside it!
Lang:
Aiyaaaaaaaaa!
Edgeworth:
(It seems I was able to refute Agent Lang's reasoning.)
Gumshoe:
Someone needs to go investigate Blaise's house right away, pal! We need to know what was inside that bag!
Officer:
Yessir!
Hold it!
Lotta:
Y'all pipe down and listen up! Y'all just been sayin' whatever works best for y'all!
Edgeworth:
(...And the noisy one returns.)
Lotta:
That there's the footprints of the Mighty Moozilla! They ain't just some random holes dug up by that old coot!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I believe the true nature of these footprints has already been proven quite logically.
Lotta:
Logic schmogic, I ain't buyin' it! Say whatcha want, but I know what I saw, and I saw Moozilla!
Edgeworth:
(Is she referring to how she saw Moozilla out of the window of the Grand Tower...? Preposterous.)
Nicole:
Upon our journalist's souls, we ain't havin' none of it!
Edgeworth:
(That statement is an insult to journalists everywhere...)
Nicole:
Ah! That's right! There's more to them monsters than just those footprints! I remember hearin' that sonny over there was seen with the monster earlier! I reckon that gal over there said she witnessed it herself!
Edgeworth:
(When these two are together, all meaningful talk grinds to a halt...)
Kay:
If we only knew just what the "monster" really was, I think those two would quiet down. Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything you can do?
Edgeworth:
(The monster's true identity...?) We don't have much choice... Let's see what we can do.
Lotta:
Isn't there somethin' y'all ain't tellin' us about the monster!? Nicole! Ask 'em! Ask 'em right now!
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
....Please settle down. Regarding the true identity of that "monster", I already know what it is.
Lotta:
Wha'd ya say!?
Edgeworth:
That's right. The video John recorded provided the hint that I needed...
Lotta:
Whatchu talkin' bout?
Edgeworth:
(Ms. Nichols saw Gourdy... ...when she went to check up on John's practice. At that times, she mistook "something" for Gourdy.) The "monster" can be seen in this photograph.
Lotta:
What!? Ain't that just some plain old souvenir photo!? Y'all don't really think ya can pull the wool over the eyes of a pro like me, do ya?
Edgeworth:
(What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?)
Present camera crane
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was..."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
The "Gourdy" that Ms. Nichols saw... was actually this!
Lotta:
There ain't no foolin' a real pro! Yer sayin' this is Gourdy!? It don't look nothin' like it!
Edgeworth:
Argh! (I had my suspicions...)
Kay:
Let's double-check what Gourdy looks like. Something with a similar shape might be in the photo!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. (Gourdy's shape...?)
Leads back to:
"(What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?)"
Edgeworth:
Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was... ...this camera crane!
Lotta:
Wh-What!?
Edgeworth:
The video John recorded was shot from fairly high up. A shot from this position would be impossible without a camera crane.
Hold it!
Nicole:
But...! There ain't no way Ms. Nichols would mistake a camera crane for Gourdy!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I wonder about that. ...Ms. Nichols.
Penny:
Y-Yes!
Edgeworth:
Earlier, you said the prescription for your glasses didn't match your eyesight anymore, correct?
Penny:
Yes. Lately, it seems like my eyesight has suddenly gotten a lot worse.
Edgeworth:
So would you say that you weren't able to see Gourdy very clearly in the dark?
Penny:
That's right... Its silhouette was all I could make out...
Nicole:
But, remember what Ms. Nichols said!? And I quote, "Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile..."!
Lotta:
Camera cranes ain't got no flesh on 'em, let alone skin! It's just a bare steel frame!
Edgeworth:
That is certainly true. At least, in the case of this photo... However, last night it did have skin.
Hold it!
Lotta:
Y'all just doin' whatever ya can to get in the way of our big scoop, ain't ya!?
Edgeworth:
(That was not my intention... ...but since I've come this far, it's time to put an end to your nonsense.) Gourdy's skin is right before our very eyes. This is the "skin" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw!
Present vinyl sheets
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is the true identity of Gourdy's skin!
Lotta:
And just how could somethin' like that be taken for skin, ya heinous prosecutor!? Yer just spoutin' nonsense, tryin' to take our whole scoop for yerself! Yer pure evil! Yer a demon prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (That is decidedly not what I'm trying to do.) On its own, the crane bears no resemblance to Gourdy at all.
Kay:
Something must have been draped over the crane.
Edgeworth:
(Last night, it looked like it was going to rain... And if that's the case, there's only one thing it could have been!)
Leads back to:
"This is the "skin" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw!"
Edgeworth:
As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night. While it never actually rained... ...John still covered the camera crane with a rainproof sheet. Which, to Ms. Nichols... looked like a monster's skin!
Nicole:
Whaaaaaaaat!
Lotta:
Y-Ya gotta be kiddin' meeee!
Edgeworth:
Isn't that right, John?
John:
Man, you saw through it all. .....Not bad, old man.
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, the "Gourdy" that Ms. Nichols saw was nothing more than an illusion.
Lotta:
Not again... Looks like my dream has shriveled up and died once again...
Nicole:
M-Mentor!
Kay:
Seems like things have finally settled down.
Lotta:
I really thought the boy was hidin' somethin' from me... Guess I had it all wrong.
Lang:
...Now that we've figured out the true form of the monster, everyone seems refreshed.
Kay:
Actually, there's two people here who are totally bummed out.
Forensics:
Agent Lang! The report is in, sir! We've got the results of President Huang's autopsy!
Lang:
Good! Show it to me!
Lang:
"Contusions and bone fractures found across the body, resulting from tremendous pressure." So, this was the cause of death. In other words... he was crushed to death.
Edgeworth:
(I thought as much...)
Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer.
Lang:
The yellow stain on his chest is currently under investigation... ...but it seems that gunpowder residue was found on his right hand.
Kay:
Sunflower residue!? I didn't know the president was into gardening!
Edgeworth:
No, gunpowder residue. Traces of it are left behind when a gun is fired. Since it has been found on his right hand, it's possible that the president fired a gun.
Kay:
A gun, huh? But we didn't find any guns when we investigated this area.
Edgeworth:
(...Unexplained gunpowder residue? I'll have to look over the autopsy report later.) Now then, Agent Lang. It seems we have our answer. The president did not die from falling off the roof of the Grand Tower. Rather, he died from being crushed under Moozilla's head!
Lang:
I can't deny it... Looks like your logic was right after all.
Kay:
This means the suspicions surrounding Ms. Courtney should be cleared up, right!?
Edgeworth:
Yes... Not only the cause of death, but the time of death proves her innocence as well. Judge Courtney met with the president two nights ago. However, according to the autopsy report, the time of death was around 11 PM last night. Moozilla's head also fell last night... It matches up perfectly.
Kay:
That's a relief!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
...Isn't it a bit too early to be relieved?
Edgeworth:
(Agent Lang?)
Lang:
The president died after being crushed by the Moozilla's head. That, I will admit. But the problem is, who was responsible for the falling head...?
Edgeworth:
Moozilla's head fell last night. And last night, the one who was at the film lot was...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
What are you saying!? Surely, you're not implying...
Lang:
That's right. You killed him, didn't you? John Marsh!
John:
........
Lang:
That pup is hiding something. He was at the scene where the body was discovered last night. He also saw the "footprints". And despite that, he still claims to know absolutely nothing about the incident? Isn't that a bit too convenient?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
These footprint-shaped holes have not been proven to be related to the case! Just because he saw the holes, doesn't necessarily mean that he's involved in the incident!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
You sure about that? Take a look at the pup's face.
John:
..............
Lang:
He looks pretty shaken up to me.
Edgeworth:
(It looks like he hit the mark... but John doesn't want to talk about it.)
Lang:
If he doesn't feel like talking, then I have an idea of my own. Let's check the tape.
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. What is your intention?
Lang:
The police have a device that lets you analyze the video footage up close and personal.
Courtney:
Agent Lang. You would suspect John enough to go that far...
Edgeworth:
(As long as John's lips are sealed... ...this may be the only way for us to get closer to the truth.) Detective Gumshoe! If I'm not mistaken you have that device with you, correct?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Analysis is ready to go, sir!
Lang:
Now we're talking!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Would you please perform the video analysis for us?
Edgeworth:
(She wants me to do it...?)
Courtney:
Who knows what kind of faults that wolf-man will find in it!
Edgeworth:
(This isn't exactly my strong suit, but I suppose I have no choice... Are there any new clues shown on the video?)
Monster costume
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
It's the Moozilla costume. If you zoom in, you can see that the back is unzipped.
Kay:
Yeah. Mr. Powers was supposed to get inside to play the monster in the movie. ...But, I don't really get it. The Mozilla in the movie is supposed to be big enough to demolish an entire building. Once he's inside the costume, how does he activate its megazord form?
Edgeworth:
...I think you have a big misunderstanding. The costume doesn't actually become big.
Kay:
I see. So what's big is not the costume, but the misunderstanding. Hmm... I think I kinda get it now. Thanks!
Edgeworth:
(Does she really understand...?)
Leads back to:
"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)"
Dirt ground
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
Blaised Debeste used the tools in his garage to dig up something.
Kay:
There was a huge hammer in his garage too.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. That was probably used to break the concrete. As it turns out, these weren't Moozilla's footprints at all. Are you disappointed?
Kay:
A Great Thief needs to have the strength to accept the truth, no matter how hard it is. I must become stronger. Much, much stronger!
Edgeworth:
(...I guess she couldn't handle the truth.)
Leads back to:
"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)"
Di-Jun Huang (after zooming)
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"(Th-This is...!)"
Anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
There's nothing of interest here.
Leads back to:
"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)"
Edgeworth:
(Th-This is...!)
Kay:
What's the matter? I wanna see too! ...Hm? Eeeeeeeeeek!
Lang:
Hey! What's wrong!? Show it to me!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth! I request you submit the evidence to the court!
Edgeworth:
...Please take a look at the top right corner of the zoomed-in video.
Lang:
Th-This... This person is...! ...th-the presideeeeeent!
Courtney:
Impossible!
John:
Huh!? N-No way!
Lang:
It seems we've finally found it at last. The evidence that points to the true killer...!
Edgeworth:
(This video places John at a major disadvantage...!)
John:
Y-You're wrong! That's not right! I didn't know anything about this!
Lang:
That's not gonna cut it. It's clear that you and the victim were together at the same place where his body was later found! John Marsh! There's no doubt. You killed the president!
Courtney:
N-No! This can't be...! Why, why would you...? John... please don't tell me... Did you really kill the president?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Is this really decisive evidence...?
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. Looks like even you can't object to this.
Edgeworth:
(Ngh...!)
Lang:
That pup said he didn't know anything, right? And yet, the president's right here in the video!
John:
........
Edgeworth:
John! What are you hiding?
Courtney:
John...! Please tell us the truth!
John:
.......... The truth is... The truth is... It's all my fault...
Courtney:
John Marsh! What did you do!?
John:
M-M-Moozilla's head falling was all my fault!
-- During the Rehearsal --
John:
While I was setting up the equipment on the roof, I used the heater...
After that, I went down to practice, but I forgot to turn it off.
Then my mom called me, so I left the film lot.
When I came back to the lot, after the phone call was over...
Moozilla's head that was on the roof had fallen...
And right next to it was the president, lying dead on the ground...
Courtney:
H-How can that be...?
Edgeworth:
I see. There were indeed traces that something had caught fire on the rooftop.
John:
..It was just a small fire, so I was able to put it out by myself.
Kay:
So... the president's death was John's fault?
Gumshoe:
But, wouldn't that make this an accident, sir?
Edgeworth:
...And then, what did you do with the fallen head?
John:
I took it apart, brought the pieces up to the roof, and put it back together.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
So, you put out the fire, and even put the fallen head back on the roof. Which means you were hiding evidence... We can't be having that, you naughty little pup.
Hold it!
John:
I didn't do it on purpose! I really did just forget to turn off the heater...
Edgeworth:
When the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand...
Kay:
...it would've fallen off! So, the head fell down because of the fire!
Edgeworth:
Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
...Was it really just an accident? If that's the truth, then what was the president doing here?
John:
I-I don't know! There was no one else around when I was there!
Lang:
You expect me to believe that!? The president wouldn't have just come to a place like this without a reason, you know!
Edgeworth:
(Indeed, the president's reason for coming here is still a huge mystery... Two nights ago, he met with Judge Courtney on the roof of the Grand Tower... ...and last night, he was here at the film lot. Did he meet with John...? I'll have to listen to John's testimony very carefully...!)
Rebuttal
-- During the Rehearsal --
John:
While I was setting up the equipment on the roof, I used the heater...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
John. You are still young. I know it can get a little cold in early spring, but you shouldn't have to resort to a heater...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
It is precisely because he is young that he must make sure to take good care of himself!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
However, while it can get a bit chilly during this time of year, I wouldn't necessarily say...
Hold it!
John:
Hold it, old man. Is this really the right time to be having this argument?
Edgeworth:
G..... Gah! (He's completely right.)
Courtney:
John. You did well to get the better of Mr. Edgeworth, but please mind your language.
Edgeworth:
(Let's not forget that he got the better of you too, Your Honor...)
John:
I-I know, Mom... So, umm... where was I?
John:
After that, I went down to practice, but I forgot to turn it off.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You forgot to turn off the heater? You didn't check it before leaving the roof?
John:
I meant to turn it off, but I was too focused on practicing, so... And come on, everyone forgets stuff like that sometimes!
Kay:
Yeah, I gotcha! I forget small things like that all the time too! Like sometimes, I'll forget to turn off the AC or the lights in Mr. Edgeworth's office... ...or I'll jump off the ladder for his bookshelves, or leave prank calls on his answering machine. But forgetting to turn off the heater is really dangerous, so you've gotta be careful!
Edgeworth:
(Some of those things had nothing to do with forgetfulness...) John. Please continue.
John:
Looks like you've got it rough too, old man. Well, back to my story...
John:
Then my mom called me, so I left the film lot.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
It was late at night at the film lot... and not a single member of the film crew was around. So then, why did you have to leave the premises in order to answer the phone call?
John:
I totally forgot about the phone call thing... so I kinda panicked. If I didn't answer it fast, I would have been busted for leaving the hotel without permission.
Edgeworth:
In that case, why didn't you just answer it here?
John:
B-Because I was rehearsing, all the cameras and mics were on. If I talked here, every last word I said to Mom would've been caught on camera!
Edgeworth:
(So he was embarrassed that the conversation with his mother would be recorded.)
John:
Anyways, I stopped practicing for a bit and rushed out of the film lot.
John:
When I came back to the lot, after the phone call was over...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
In that phone call, you lied and said you were at the hotel, correct?
Kay:
Why didn't you tell your mom that you were rehearsing?
John:
If I told her that, she would've called the hotel and made them send me a taxi or something.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Of course I would have! A child alone on the streets at the time of night... What sort of parent would allow their child to be in such a dangerous situation!?
Edgeworth:
Hmm. I guess kids just don't understand how their parents feel.
Kay:
It goes both ways, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...Indeed. Now then, John. Please tell us about what happened after the phone call.
John:
Huh? O-Oh yeah. Of course. When the call was finished and I came back here...
John:
Moozilla's head that was on the roof had fallen...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Was there any indication that the head was about to fall?
John:
...I-I don't know. I was focused on my rehearsal.
Edgeworth:
So you forgot to turn off the heater, which led to a fire on the roof. I would think you should have at least heard something.
John:
Heard something...? Oh, I was wearing headphones, so...
Edgeworth:
Headphones?
John:
Listening to the movie's soundtrack helps me get into the scene... I had it on full blast. That's why I didn't hear anything.
Edgeworth:
And yet, you noticed your mother's incoming call?
John:
I had my phone on vibrate, old man. That's how I noticed. Anyways, the head had fallen...
John:
And right next to it was the president, lying dead on the ground...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
What was the state of the body?
John:
...I didn't get a good look. 'Cause it was dark. ........
Edgeworth:
(Hm? He's suddenly become as quiet as a mouse.)
Kay:
I guess John doesn't really want to remember anything about the body...
Edgeworth:
(...Is that the only reason why he's gone so quiet? Should I press him for more details?)
Press him further
Leads to:
"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?"
Leave him be
Edgeworth:
(It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.)
Edgeworth:
You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?
John:
! Th-That's... well...
Edgeworth:
(He's clearly shaken. ...He must be hiding something.) Wouldn't you normally call for help if you see someone collapsed on the ground? However, you did nothing of the sort...
John:
But... But he...! He was already dead...
Edgeworth:
Is that so? You seem quite certain that the president was already dead... Now, is there a reason for that, I wonder?
Hold it!
John:
The guy was collapsed on the ground, and right next to him was the fallen monster's head. I'm not stupid. It wasn't hard to imagine what happened...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You can imagine whatever you want, but there was no way for you to know that he was dead! You actually checked to make sure the president was dead, didn't you?
John:
Urk.....! Y-Yeah... that's right! I was scared... but I got up close to the body and checked to see if he was breathing.
Edgeworth:
(I thought as much... However, why would he hide that? There must be a reason...) ...Please tell me the state of the body at that time.
John:
A-At first, I didn't know he was dead... I would've realized sooner if there had been any blood... ...but there wasn't a single drop, and his clothes were completely spotless. Either way, he wasn't breathing. That's how I knew he was already dead...
Edgeworth:
...Would you please append those statements to your testimony?
Add statements:
"I didn't know right away that he was dead. There was no blood, and his clothes were spotless." and "But he wasn't breathing at all when I checked, so I knew he was already dead."
Press (after fully pressing this statement)
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, you knew immediately that it was the president?
John:
Not right away. It was dark, so I had to get a bit closer. But... I knew his face because we worked together briefly, after all.
Kay:
Y-You worked with the president!? Wow, John...! When did you do that!?
Edgeworth:
Have you already forgotten, Kay? The president had a cameo in this movie.
Kay:
Ah! That's right! Of course... N-Now I remember!
Edgeworth:
Good for you. So, John. You confirmed he was dead?
John:
I didn't know right away that he was dead. There was no blood, and his clothes were spotless.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you were unable to tell if he was dead because of the lack of stains on his clothes... Are you certain of that?
John:
Of course I am. You guys saw the body too, right? So what's the big ideal!?
Edgeworth:
You said that the area was dark. And yet, you were still able to make that observation?
John:
I'm telling you, there wasn't a single stain on his entire body! Give it a rest, old man!
Edgeworth:
Heh... Thank you, John. That was all I needed to hear.
Kay:
Are clean clothes that important to you, Mr. Edgeworth? Mine are freshly washed though!
Edgeworth:
Next... could you tell me how you determined that the president was dead?
John:
Well, there wasn't anything to let me know right away that he was dead, you see...
Present Crime Scene Notes
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"His clothes were "spotless"...?"
John:
But he wasn't breathing at all when I checked, so I knew he was already dead.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
How did you check if he had stopped breathing?
John:
They taught us how at school. You get right up close to the person's nose... ...and check to see if you can feel their breath. I never thought I'd have to do it for real, though...
Kay:
That was really brave of you, to be able to do something like that. John, you sure are amazing for an elementary school kid.
Edgeworth:
Kay, he's in middle school. Please try to get that into your head sometime soon...
Kay:
It'd be pretty scary to see a corpse just suddenly appear out of the blue like that... Not to mention the fallen monster head lying next to the body.
Edgeworth:
Panic would certainly be an understandable response to such a situation.
Kay:
But still, all things considered... This was just an accident, right?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. That is, if we decide to take John's words at face value... (I wouldn't mind having some more concrete details on the state of the crime scene...)
Edgeworth:
His clothes were "spotless"...?
John:
Y... Yeah, that's right. You got a problem with it, old man?
Edgeworth:
John. It is painfully obvious that you are desperately trying to hide something from me.
John:
Wh-Wh-What are you going on about!? I-I'm not hiding anything!
Edgeworth:
You are hiding... ...something about this yellow stain on the president's clothes, correct?
John:
!
Edgeworth:
Why did you leave it entirely out of your testimony? The fact you made no mention of it only serves to cast more suspicion upon yourself!
John:
...Ugh! Th-That's because...
Edgeworth:
I hope you have a convincing explanation.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
........
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney?
Courtney:
Allow me to explain.
Edgeworth:
Why are you...?
Courtney:
The yellow stain left on the president's chest... ...is almost certainly Lion Lily pollen.
Lang:
Lion Lily...?
Courtney:
When I met with the president on the roof of the Grand Tower two nights ago... ...I brought him a bouquet of Lion Lilies. Lion Lilies are beautiful flowers with stunning golden petals. Some of the pollen from the lilies must have gotten on the president's suit.
Kay:
Huh? But... ...I didn't see any lilies in the security footage though?
Courtney:
They were simply obscured by the president's body.
Edgeworth:
Why did you bring a bouquet?
Courtney:
Th-That..... I... I cannot say.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hey, hey! You're keeping way too many secrets! You won't tell us why you met with the president OR the reason you brought him flowers!?
Courtney:
.....My apologies. However, I did give him the bouquet. That much is true.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But when the president's body was discovered, we didn't find any flowers.
Courtney:
I... I honestly don't know how that could be...
Lang:
Hah! Hey, Ms. Judge! All your answers have been too vague... You "can't say" this, and you "don't know" that! Do you accept flimsy testimony like that in your trials!?
Hold it!
John:
Hey! Cut it out!
Courtney:
J... John!
John:
I... threw the flowers away.
Edgeworth:
You threw them away? So, there were flowers near the body when you found it?
John:
.....Yeah, that's right. They were right on top of the president's body. They had been crushed as flat as pancakes, though...
Kay:
Ah! I see! So the flowers were squashed by Moozilla's head too...
Edgeworth:
And a large amount of pollen got stuck to the president's suit. ...That seems to be the gist of it. However, why did you go out of your way to dispose of the flowers?
John:
..........No reason.
Edgeworth:
(So John's not going to tell us anything either...)
Kay:
I guess mother and son both have a lot of secrets, huh.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
That is not true. At the very least, I can tell you why John threw away those flowers.
Kay:
Huh!?
Courtney:
John. You saw me leaving the house with those flowers in hand, did you not?
John:
........
Kay:
Ah! I get it! John saw the flowers and thought of his mom!
Edgeworth:
...He threw them away in order to protect Judge Courtney from being suspected.
John:
Th-That's not true. You're all wrong!
Edgeworth:
(...That was his worst lie yet...)
Bouquet data jotted down in my Organizer.
Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer.
Courtney:
I often decorate our house with those flowers. The bouquet must have reminded him of me.
Lang:
So the pup just happens to find the flowers from his mother's bouquet on top of the body... That's why he threw them away and kept silent about the body? Hah! That's a tidy little story if I've ever heard one.
Kay:
And what's wrong with that!? I suppose you prefer untidy, messy stories, Agent Lang?
Lang:
Don't tell me you've forgotten already, Missy? This pup confessed that he caused the monster's head to fall last night.
Kay:
Oooh... That's true, but...
Lang:
He's currently the only suspect in the president's murder!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. It is true that there are many reasons to suspect John...) ...However! There is someone other than John who is far more suspicious!
Lang:
What'd you say?
Edgeworth:
John himself was kidnapped by that very person not too long ago.
Gumshoe:
And we rescued him from the refrigerated warehouse near the harbor, pal!
Lang:
A refrigerated warehouse?
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! The refrigeration wasn't turned on, so he wasn't about to freeze to death... ...but if he hadn't yelled out for help, we would've never found him.
Kay:
Once the sleeping drugs wore off, he was finally able to call out for help.
Edgeworth:
Sleeping drugs... huh. If I recall correctly, when you were kidnapped...
Kay:
That's right! There was a bottle lying on the floor of the refrigerated warehouse... I think it was the same thing that was used one me not long ago. That Sleepy zZz stuff! It's super powerful!
Sleeping Drugs data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
How about it, Agent Lang? John is clearly a victim. There is a mastermind at work behind the scenes of this case.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
I don't know anything about this so-called "mastermind". You say they were here last night?
Edgeworth:
I... still don't know for sure yet...
Lang:
Hah! It's not like you to be so vague, Mr. Prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
(...Indeed, I still don't have any evidence that ties the mastermind to this murder... Is there someone else? Is there anyone besides John who had the opportunity to murder the president...? That's it...!)
Lang:
...As I thought. In the end, that pup is our only suspect.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Isn't there one more suspect, Agent Lang...?
Lang:
What's this!?
Edgeworth:
Didn't we prove it earlier? Last night, there was one more person here!
Lang:
.....Blaise Debeste. You're saying he's the one who did it?
Edgeworth:
Last night, John was not alone. Blaise Debeste was here too. Shouldn't we consider him to be a new suspect?
Lang:
Blaise Debeste... killed the president!?
Edgeworth:
It's entirely possible.
Lang:
........ .....Blaise Debeste... It can't be...! The same guy from 12 years ago?
Edgeworth:
(Hm? 12 years ago? That keeps popping up...)
Lang:
......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life.
Roland:
Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...?
Lang:
You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree?
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang! What happened 12 years ago?
Lang:
.....Nothing that concerns you.
Edgeworth:
On the contrary. It might just have some sort of connection with this case.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
.....Hmph. And I suppose you have some proof, Mr. Prosecutor? Show me evidence that there's a connection between this case and the one 12 years ago!
Edgeworth:
Evidence... you say?
Lang:
If you don't have any evidence, then there's no point in talking about it.
Edgeworth:
(Is there any evidence that connects this case with what happened 12 years ago?)
Present Letter from Unknown
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This letter was sent to Jill Crane, who was murdered two days ago. Although the sender is currently unknown... Here, it is written as follows: "Please get revenge for 12 years ago".
Lang:
What!? 12 years ago!?
Edgeworth:
That's not all. Take a look at this as well. This is a report written by Patricia Roland to Blaise Debeste regarding Knightley. ...Please read this part here.
Lang:
"That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago"...?
Leads to:
"Agent Lang... Something big is happening here."
Present Report on Knightley
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is a report written by Patricia Roland to Blaise Debeste regarding Knightley. ...Please read this part here.
Lang:
"That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago"...?
Edgeworth:
That's not all. Take a look at this as well. This letter was sent to Jill Crane, who was murdered two days ago. Although the sender is currently unknown... Here, it is written as follows: "Please get revenge for 12 years ago".
Lang:
What!? 12 years ago!?
Leads to:
"Agent Lang... Something big is happening here."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. Could you take a look at this?
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor, get that thing out of my face! Lang Zi says: "The sun sets fast in Zheng Fa..." We don't have time to waste looking at your useless junk!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (So this doesn't show the connection...)
Kay:
Let's look over the evidence one more time, Mr. Edgeworth! Wasn't there something written about 12 years ago somewhere in there?
Lang:
How about it, Mr. Prosecutor? Got any evidence?
Leads back to:
"(Is there any evidence that connects this case with what happened 12 years ago?)"
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... Something big is happening here. Jill Crane's murder two days ago. And now, the president's murder today. There has to be some connection there. And the key to solving it lies in what happened 12 years ago, does it not?
Lang:
......You're asking me to reopen the old wounds of the Lang clan?
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. I beg of you.
Lang:
........
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
(Who was that just now?)
???:
Shifu!
Lang:
Y-You guys! What are you all doing here!?
MIB:
We followed you here, Shifu! We heard that Shifu was investigating the incident from 12 years ago...
Lang:
You idiots...! I'm not your boss anymore. Get back to your own posts!
MIB:
Sir......... We can't do that!
Lang:
What'd you say? Are you disobeying my order?
MIB:
Shifu! We also beg of you! Reinvestigate... the SS-5 Incident from 12 years ago! None of us could ever forget that case! We know you feel the same way, Shifu...
Lang:
........
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. Even your former subordinates desire to reinvestigate the case.
Lang:
And you think you can solve the mysteries of that case?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps I can... with your help.
Lang:
Tch! ...I got it. I accept your invitation.
MIB:
Shifu! Shifu! Shifu!
Kay:
Now then! With that decided, I guess it's my turn to shine!
Edgeworth:
Kay?
Kay:
We're investigating a case from the past, right? And guess what the best tool for that is?
Edgeworth:
The Little Mr. Thief...
Kay:
Right! If we have the case files from the past case, I can re-create it!
Lang:
Unfortunately... I don't have the case files.
Kay:
Huh!? What do you mean?
Lang:
Access to those case files is restricted. It's being treated as highly classified information.
Edgeworth:
Why is that?
Lang:
I don't know, but it seems like there were a lot of things that they wanted to keep hidden. Even what I know... ...is limited to what was published in the newspapers back then.
Edgeworth:
That will not be a problem. In any case, please tell us what you know.
Lang:
Sure... The SS-5 Incident... The incident occurred on a winter day 12 years ago... It was the 10th of February. The police department in this country received a call from a group of kidnappers. "We've kidnapped President Huang" ...they said.
Edgeworth:
Kidnapped?
Lang:
The SS-5 Incident was the case of President Huang's kidnapping. They demanded a ransom of 100 million dollars.
Kay:
100 million!? ...Wait, just how much is that?
Edgeworth:
(It's such a large amount, she's having trouble visualizing it.)
Lang:
That night, my old man was the last person to meet with the president. They were together at the Zheng Fa embassy until midnight on February 10th. After that, no one knows what the president was doing up until he was kidnapped. With the president's life at stake, the Zheng Fa government frantically gathered the money. After that, the ransom was delivered and the president was returned safe and sound.
Kay:
So... President Huang has been the president since 12 years ago. That's really amazing.
Lang:
Well... being in office for so long is just a small part of how amazing the man is.
Edgeworth:
(Lang seemed a bit happy when he said that.) And, what happened to the kidnappers?
Lang:
Well, a top secret covert investigation was carried out, then a secret trial was held.
Edgeworth:
A trial? Does that mean the suspect was caught?
Lang:
The suspect was... Patricia Roland.
Edgeworth:
! Then, the reason you came to the prison a few days ago...
Lang:
Yeah. I was put on extended leave from Interpol... ...so I decided to go back and reinvestigate what happened 12 years ago. First, I had to get a look at the face of my target.
Courtney:
...So the trial 12 years ago ended with a Not Guilty verdict.
Lang:
Yeah... Back then, my old man was in charge of every aspect of the president's security. He took responsibility for the kidnapping and was relieved of his post as bodyguard... ...but he continued to investigate as a regular police officer, until... he finally found the culprit. And it was none other than Patricia Roland. There was no way she could be innocent! However, the result was a Not Guilty verdict. In the end, the case went unsolved... Crushed in both body and soul... my old man resigned from the police.
Edgeworth:
What was the basis for arresting Patricia Roland?
Lang:
There was a lot of evidence. At least, that's what I think. But, I can't see those documents for myself... ...so that's where my story ends.
Kay:
What should we do? With only this much information... ...even the Little Thief would have a hard time producing a re-creation.
Edgeworth:
(Ngh... Is there really nothing we can do...?)
Hold it!
???:
Looks like you could use some help.
Lang:
Who's that?
Edgeworth:
Franziska!
Kay:
And Mr. Shields too!
Ray:
We finished up with the trial and finally managed to catch up with you guys.
Franziska:
Here, take this.
Edgeworth:
This is...?
Gumshoe:
Ah! It's the case files for the SS-5 Incident, sir!
SS-5 Incident Files jotted down in my Organizer.
Franziska:
When Roland mentioned "12 years ago" during the trial, it caught my interest. I looked into it immediately, and got it touch with Interpol.
Edgeworth:
I expected no less from you, Franziska.
Franziska:
...Don't get the wrong idea, Miles Edgeworth. I didn't prepare these documents for you, the former prosecutor. I did it for the sake of the investigator taking up the case his father left behind.
Lang:
Sis...! But, I thought information on the SS-5 Incident was restricted to the public.
Franziska:
That restriction was placed by the prosecutor in charge of the case: Blaise Debeste.
Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste was the prosecutor in charge!?
Lang:
Him...!
Franziska:
However... ...as a result of the trial just now, Blaise's authority has been revoked. It's all thanks to his son...
Edgeworth:
Sebastian...? (By bringing down his father, the door to this past case has been opened.)
Franziska:
Prosecutor Debeste is currently wrapping things up in Patricia Roland's trial. He told me to relay this message to you. "Leave Pops and his cohorts to me. You guys just take care of the case on your end."
Edgeworth:
Heh. He's become quite reliable, right before our very eyes...
Courtney:
Truly...
Kay:
Alrighty then! This is perfect! Now that we have the files, just leave the re-creation to me!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Well then, let us begin. According to these documents... ...it appears that the incident took place right in front of the Tower Plaza.
Kay:
Then let's head to the plaza right away!
April 6, 3:25 PMOutside Grand TowerTower Plaza
Edgeworth:
Kay. Would you please activate the Little Mr. Thief?
Kay:
Right! With these case files, re-creating everything should be a snap! Where should I start?
Edgeworth:
Where indeed. According to these documents... ...it seems there was a witness to the kidnapping of the president. A freelance journalist by the name of Jack Cameron. However... ...he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and was murdered by the culprit...
Lang:
So that would mean the place he saw the president at was here.
Kay:
Here? ...At the Grand Tower?
Edgeworth:
No. The Grand Tower was only built around a year ago, Kay. Before that, this place contained mostly old abandoned buildings. However, 12 years ago, this place was...
Lang:
Hah! Now you're finally talking about some stuff that I know.
Edgeworth:
!
Lang:
Yeah... 12 years ago, at the very spot was... ...the Happy Family Home.
Gumshoe:
What's that, pal?
Lang:
It was a place where children who had lost their parents could live... ...or to put ot simply, it was an orphanage.
Edgeworth:
So the president was kidnapped at that orphanage...
Lang:
...and, the head of that facility at the time was Patricia Roland. ...Apparently, Roland always referred to it as her Home.
Edgeworth:
!
Courtney:
It seems that suspicion would naturally fall upon her...
Edgeworth:
(Patricia Roland, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang... The darkness that remains from the SS-5 Incident still casts a shadow on the present case.) Kay, I'd like you to input the investigation data from Jack Cameron's murder case. We can probably assume that he was killed by one of the kidnappers.
Kay:
So if we solve the murder case, we'll know who the kidnappers were, right!?
Edgeworth:
Precisely. I'm counting on you.
John:
Wh-What the heck is this!? Everything's green!
Edgeworth:
(I've come to expect such reactions...) This is a re-creation of the grounds of the facility that stood here 12 years ago... ...based on the documents from the police investigation.
Kay:
I re-created the scene to show what it looked like when police arrived at 7 AM the next day!
Edgeworth:
...It appears a fair amount of snow had piled up here.
Lang:
Yeah. I heard that the footprints in the snow were prime pieces of evidence. The snow fell during the day, on the day of the incident.
Edgeworth:
(So the snow only fell before the crime took place... ...which means the footprints wouldn't have been erased by any further snow. I must make sure to pay close attention to these footprints.)
Begin Investigation
OrphanageFront Yard
Logic
"Three footprints" and "Flowerbeds"
Edgeworth:
Perhaps this is the true nature of the monster's footprints...
Kay:
True nature?
Edgeworth:
Compare the positions of the three footprints and the three flowerbeds on the left.
Kay:
Ah!
Edgeworth:
The exposed areas of dirt match the areas where the flowerbeds were!
Kay:
So Blaise dug holes in front of where each of the three flowerbeds used to be...
Edgeworth:
Exactly. Now, why would he do such a thing? I believe we have a piece of evidence that tells us why. Why did Blaise dig holes in the ground near the flowerbeds?
Present Report on Knightley
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The report from Patricia Roland to Blaise Debeste."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is the reason why Blaise dug holes in the ground near the flowerbeds!
Kay:
Aha! ...So, what does this tell us?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Isn't it obvious?
Kay:
No, it's not!
Edgeworth:
Obviously, this tells us absolutely nothing at all!
Kay:
Please be more serious, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
...Mmph! (Well, that wasn't it.)
Kay:
Let's take another look at the evidence! There must be something in there!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. There must be some piece of evidence that explains Blaise's actions.
Leads back to:
"Why did Blaise dig holes in the ground near the flowerbeds?"
Edgeworth:
The report from Patricia Roland to Blaise Debeste. It said that something was "laid to rest in front of the flowerbed".
Kay:
So Blaise was following Ms. Roland's instructions to dig it up? But, why would he dig up three holes?
Edgeworth:
The report didn't state which of three flowerbeds the item was in front of.
Kay:
Oh. So Blaise didn't know exactly where to dig... That's why he had to dig up all three spots!
Edgeworth:
Most likely, yes. I'm sure Blaise himself was none too happy about that.
Kay:
He went through all that trouble. I wonder what he was trying to dig up (What did Blaise dig up? - Instructed by Patricia, something was dug up near the flowerbeds...?)?
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Notice anything?
Kay:
So there was an orphanage here 12 years ago! And what's more, the head of the orphanage was Ms. Roland. Talk about a surprise!
Edgeworth:
So that means this was where the SS-5 Incident occurred 12 years ago.
Kay:
The one where the president of Zheng Fa was kidnapped, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. And the only witness, Jack Cameron, was then subsequently murdered. However, when you consider that this case was classified as top secret...
Kay:
...it starts to smell fishy, like there's something hidden behind this case! Even so, the people involved in this incident... Aren't they all people that we already know?
Edgeworth:
(Patricia Roland, Blaise Debeste, and the president of Zheng Fa...) The cases that we've been involved in recently, and the SS-5 Incident... It's hard to think they're not related.
Kay:
Let's steal the truth hidden behind this case! I'll keep updating the info if we find out anything new, so... ...let's focus on the areas that have changed in the re-creation.
Little Thief
Edgeworth:
To think that your Little Mr. Thief would help us out once again.
Kay:
It's just "Little Thief"! And now matter how useful Little Thief is... ...if there's an error with the info, the re-creation could come out a bit strange. If you find anything strange, please present some evidence!
Edgeworth:
So I can examine things like I normally do, even if it's just a re-creation?
Kay:
Yup! Please go all out and investigate every suspicious-looking nook and cranny! I don't have enough data to do it now, but... ...once you gather enough info, I can re-create the scene at a different moment in time.
Edgeworth:
Alright. I'll ask for your help when the time comes.
Kay:
Is that so? But in science, a bit of danger always comes with the territory...
Edgeworth:
(That's not exactly what you would call "a bit of danger"!)
Present
SS-5 Incident Files, Cameron's Autopsy Report, Cameron's Testimony or Cameron's Photo
Kay:
This is a case that's gone on for over 12 years? That's a really long time... Back then, I was just a small kid. Mr. Lang and his clan have been agonizing and suffering all this time... We definitely have to solve this case. I'll do my best as well!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. I'll ask you to check the case files when necessary.
Kay:
Right! I'll read every word loudly and with great feeling!
Edgeworth:
(No, there's no need to put such emotion into it...)
Fire
Kay:
Hmm, it looks like only this section of the front yard was burned by the spilled kerosene. It seems there was no damage to the building itself.
Edgeworth:
Hmm. That's why it didn't turn into a bigger incident.
Kay:
But, the kid should of known better. There are some pranks that you can and can't do!
Edgeworth:
(While that's certainly true... ...I doubt the kid would want to hear that from someone calling herself the Great Thief.)
Swing
Edgeworth:
It's a swing decorated with the face of an elephant. It looks like there's some kind of motor attached to the other side of the elephant.
Kay:
There's one thought that has crossed the minds of every top-class swinger. If only I could do a full 360˚... With that powerful motor rotating the swing, that dream can finally be achieved!
Edgeworth:
Rotating, with a motor... But, wouldn't that be dangerous?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. You can't fulfill your dreams unless you're willing to take some risks.
Edgeworth:
(Is that the real problem here...?)
John Marsh
John:
...What d'ya want?
The kidnapping
Edgeworth:
John. I'd like you to tell me the exact details of your kidnapping.
Kay:
You were kidnapped at the garbage pickup area, right? Why'd you go there?
John:
You don't have to act as a go-between. I can just talk to the old man directly.
Kay:
...So he says. Looks like he's finally starting to warm up to you!
John:
I went to the garbage pickup to throw away the flowers I found on the body. It was nearby, and I thought it'd be harder to find there than if I just tossed them in a trash can. I went there last night too, but the gate was locked.
Edgeworth:
And that's why you went there again today to dispose of them.
John:
Yeah. But when I got there, someone suddenly grabbed me from behind...
Kay:
...and used Sleepy zZz on you, right? "Catching Z's is now super easy with Sleepy zZz!"
Edgeworth:
(Even though she was also a victim to it, she seems to have taken a liking to the slogan...)
John:
Whoever grabbed me was really strong. But that's all I know... I have no idea who it was.
Edgeworth:
I see. So that's what happened.
The place of captivity
Edgeworth:
After the drugs wore off... did you notice anything about your surroundings?
Kay:
"Those drugs were brought to you by Sleepy zZz. Catching Z's is now super easy with Sleepy zZz!"
John:
It was kinda cold when I woke up. I was in a dark, empty room. Boxes with foreign writing on them were lying around. So I figured I was in a warehouse.
Kay:
The whole place was like a giant refrigerator. It was a commercial warehouse.
Edgeworth:
(That's right, John was rescued thanks to the collective efforts of Kay and Detective Gumshoe.)
John:
Since it was still a bit cold, the cooling unit's power must not have been cut for too long. For some reason, they didn't think to take my phone, so... ...I used it to call for help.
Edgeworth:
I see. In any case, it's good that you're safe and sound, John.
John:
Hmph. I don't need your fake sympathy, old man.
Edgeworth:
(...What an incorrigible child.)
Kay:
He's just like a certain someone I know!

Bouquet
John:
...That's right, I was trying to protect my mom. But, what's so wrong about that!?
Edgeworth:
Your desire to protect your mother is rather admirable. However, the same can't be said for your perjury.
John:
Hmph. Call it what you want! There's no way I could stand by and do nothing while my Mom was being suspected!
Courtney:
J-John...! You...
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth was only praising your bravery. He's also saying it would've been better if you were a bit more honest about it... That about sums it up! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Umm... W-Well, more or less.
Kay:
And aren't you glad that he praised you, John?
John:
Hmph... W-Well, I guess. More or less...

Courtney:
Please, ask me anything you wish.

Courtney:
You have my heartfelt thanks for bringing John back. Oh... even the thought of him not coming back makes me...

Edgeworth:
N-No, that wasn't my intention...
Kay:
Whoo, look at him go! Mommy's little knight in shining armor! He's so cool!
John:
I-It's not like that! Quit blabbering stupid stuff about me...
Courtney:
John, please wait. May I proceed, Mr. Edgeworth? My actions were unbecoming of one who calls herself a servant of the Goddess of Law. I won't ask for forgiveness. However... I...
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. I am not as well acquainted with the Goddess of Law as you are. However... isn't that goddess also a mother of other gods?
Courtney:
...Ah!
Edgeworth:
The law makes exceptions for extenuating circumstances. It understands a mother's heart. I'd say perhaps your Goddess sympathizes with you more than you think.
Courtney:
M... Mr. Edgeworth...!
John:
I don't get it... What the heck are you two blabbering about?
Kay:
It's OK, John. I don't have a clue either!
Patricia's trial
Edgeworth:
It seems the durst has settled on day one of Patricia Roland's trial.
Courtney:
Yes. While a decision has yet to be reached, I would say a Guilty verdict is quite likely. I'm sure a thorough investigation into her connection with Blaise will be conducted as well. ...After seeing Sebastian today, I know we can put our faith in him.
Edgeworth:
Just like Kay, Sebastian is also in the midst of training for the future ahead.
Kay:
Hmmm, I see. When you say it like that, I guess we have more in common than I thought. I said a few mean things to him, so the next time we meet, I'd like to apologize to him.
Courtney:
I'm sure you will get your opportunity. But, for now...
Edgeworth:
Yes. At present, solving this case is our top priority.
Present
Yatagarasu's Badge
Courtney:
The young lady there seems to have made a full recovery.
Kay:
Yup. When you returned my father's notebook... ...I was able to return to my old self! Thank you so very much!
Courtney:
Think nothing of it. I did not do anything. The return of your notebook and the return of your memories... They were all simply the works of the Goddess of Law.
Edgeworth:
(I don't think either of those things had any relevance to the law...)
Letter from Unknown, Grand Tower, Mechanic's Gloves,Report on Knightley or Knightley's Mementos
Courtney:
The incident at the Grand Tower... It is utterly inexcusable. How dare someone commit such an impure act in the presence of the Goddess of Law.
Kay:
It really is unforgivable! I'd like to give 'em a good whack with your gavel!
Courtney:
Ms. Faraday. Even if the person is a criminal... ...that does not give us the right to mete out punishment outside of the law.
Kay:
Not even just a light tap?
Courtney:
Certainly not.
Edgeworth:
Kay. That is what Prosecutors and Judges are for. Don't worry, we will be sure to bring them to justice.
Kay:
Hmm, alright then. Let's follow this investigation down to the end! That's one of my rules!
Edgeworth:
(...I thought you had promises, not rules?)
Monster Movie Flyer, Commemorative Photo or John's Practice Video
Courtney:
Seeing John's performance on the silver screen... I always look forward to it.
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. About that...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
In fact, until I personally go and see John's movies in the theaters... ...I try to avoid learning any information about them. Please, let us not talk about it.
Edgeworth:
No, Judge Courtney. That wasn't what I...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Although I've already come to learn a little about the plot in the course of this case... ...if you intend to divulge any more details, be prepared to face the wrath of the Goddess of Law!
Edgeworth:
(It seems the Goddess of Law does not take spoilers lightly...)
Crime Scene Notes, Moozilla's Head, Moozilla Doll, Security Camera Photo or Bouquet
Courtney:
I suppose you would like me to tell you... ...what exactly took place two nights ago, and my reason for meeting with the president.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. I'm sure you yourself understand the importance of this matter.
Courtney:
Yes..... However, I cannot tell you yet. Not now, at least.
Edgeworth:
(She's determined to keep her heart closed. And without the ability to break the locks in her heart... ...I have no choice but to give up for now.)
Courtney:
...Mr. Edgeworth. May I just say one thing? This case was thrown into chaos because John tried to cover for me. I would like to take this time to offer my deepest apologies.
Edgeworth:
Do not worry yourself. My logic won't be swayed by a child's lies. Besides... (...I'm not so tactless as to condemn a child for trying to protect his mother.)
Courtney:
Besides... you were saying?
Edgeworth:
No, pay it no mind. (Mother and child... huh.)
IS-7 Incident Documents
Courtney:
18 years ago, Blaise Debeste was the Chief Prosecutor. His tacit approval allowed forged evidence to become the truth.
Edgeworth:
And as a result... many people have suffered over these past 18 years.
Courtney:
That one who was tasked with upholding the law would violate it to serve his own needs... I jointed the P.I.C. in order to correct this vulgar distortion of the law. However... just recently, even I have wavered from that path...
Edgeworth:
Your son was taken hostage. ...It would be more concerning if your heart had not wavered.
Courtney:
.......I am glad that you and Sebastian were able to discover the truth. Truly, you have my thanks.
SS-5 Incident Files, Cameron's Autopsy Report, Cameron's Testimony or Cameron's Photo
Courtney:
Blaise Debeste and Patricia Roland are both connected to this case. That much we know for sure.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. However, it seems there's more to it than that.
Courtney:
Jill Crane and President Huang. The key to understanding the link between their deaths... ...lies here as well.
Edgeworth:
(The connection between them is tenuous at best... For that reason, we must tread carefully to follow it to its conclusion.)
Kay:
In that case, we should take our time and carefully examine every nook and cranny! I even just replaced the Little Thief's batteries with new ones!
Edgeworth:
(...It runs on batteries?)
Anything else
Courtney:
What is this? Do you wish for me to crush it with my gavel?
Edgeworth:
A-Absolutely not!
Courtney:
It was merely a joke. The Goddess of Law does not permit this gavel to be used trivially.
Edgeworth:
(...You looked quite serious about it though.)
Lotta Hart and Nicole Swift
Lotta:
What a scoop! Would ya look at that! Those folks have done turned green!
Nicole:
Maybe they're sick or somethin'? But their clothes are green too...
Lotta:
Well, I'll be! Their clothes are all green too! I reckon this ain't no ordinary disease! Ya picked up on somethin' good. Looks like yer takin' it to the next level!
Nicole:
Y-Yes, Chief!
Kay:
...It looks like there's no way we'll be getting a word in.
Edgeworth:
(Not that I have any desire to intervene.)
Burnt pillar
Edgeworth:
This pillar appears to be burnt...
Kay:
According to the files, it seems there was a fire on the evening of the incident.
Edgeworth:
A fire?
Kay:
Umm. Let's see here... huh!? It says that one of the children at the orphanage spilled kerosene and set it on fire as a prank.
Edgeworth:
I guess that kid had far too much energy... And thanks to that, we can't make out any of the footprints near the main hall...
Fire data jotted down in my Organizer.
Flowerbed with yellow flower
Edgeworth:
A flowerbed...?
Kay:
According to the data, this facility had three gardens... ...and each of these gardens contained three flowerbeds (Flowerbeds - Facility had three gardens. Each one had three square-shaped flowerbeds.).
Edgeworth:
(Hm? The way these flowerbeds are lined up... Have I seen this arrangement somewhere before...?)
Kay:
Since it was during the winter, there were no flowers in bloom. What a shame!
Edgeworth:
Hm? What's this yellow flower?
Kay:
Huh? Why is there a single flower here?
Franziska:
That is a Lion Lily. It's a very rare type of lily.
Edgeworth:
Did you say Lion Lily?
Kay:
That's the flower Ms. Courtney gave to the president!
Edgeworth:
(What's it doing here? Could it be... just a coincidence?)
Franziska:
If I recall, the Lion Lily originates from Asia. In the language of flowers, it means "the bond between parent and child"...
Edgeworth:
I never knew you were so familiar with flowers.
Franziska:
That much is common sense. You're simply lacking in your studies, Miles Edgeworth.
Footprints on left side
Edgeworth:
These footprints stop near the body.
Kay:
They must be Mr. Cameron's footprints. He sure has some big feet! They look like a size 11! According to the data, his shoes matched these footprints!
Door
Kay:
Th... This door! I remember seeing it from somewhere!
Edgeworth:
Of course you would. It looks exactly like the Grand Tower door we saw earlier.
Kay:
But, this is a re-creation from 12 years ago! That means this door has been here since then.
Edgeworth:
It seems when the Grand Tower was built, they decided to reuse the door, rather than destroy it.
Kay:
It's like the old saying goes, "Discover something new by hearing up something old."
Edgeworth:
(Oh. It seems she's understood the correct meaning of a saying for once.)
Kay:
Hmm... But if you're using a microwave to do it, don't heat it for over 5 minutes.
Body
Edgeworth:
So this is the eyewitness of the president's kidnapping, Jack Cameron... (What exactly did he witness?)
Kay:
I've re-created the state of his body based on the photos taken by the police.
Edgeworth:
It appears he was struck in the head from behind.
Kay:
The murder weapon was a brick, right? It looks like the ones from this garden.
Edgeworth:
(The blood that flowed from his head has splattered all over the surroundings.)
Kay:
Here! Take this! It's Mr. Cameron's autopsy report!
Cameron's Autopsy Report jotted down in my Organizer.
Before examining cell phone, body, camera and brick
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining cell phone, body, camera and brick
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Yellow flower
Kay:
A yellow flower has fallen here. ...In the language of flowers, it means "a stolen treasure".
Edgeworth:
Kay. Please stop making things up. Still, this flower seems to be of a different variety from the ones growing nearby.
Kay:
Hmm. Well then, why is it in a place like this?
Edgeworth:
(This bothers me a little... We should examine the flowerbed itself after this.)
Kay:
I knew it, someone must've stolen this from somewhere and brought it here!
Edgeworth:
...Kay.
Kay:
And in the language of flowers, this means "an angry prosecutor".
Yellow flower (after examining flowerbed with yellow flower)
Kay:
A yellow flower has fallen here. ...It's called a "lion lily".
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Franziska told us earlier. Apparently, it comes from Asia.
Kay:
Yup. In the language of flowers, I think it means... the "bond between partners in crime".
Edgeworth:
(...It's the "bond between parent and child".)
Shoes
Edgeworth:
The key to this case lies in the footprints. Do the case files say anything about his shoes?
Kay:
Umm, shoe size:11. No athlete's foot or corns on his feet to speak of. His socks were beige, just like his trousers. Feels kind of like an old man's. Perhaps he should try wearing a bolder, brighter color to better accent his feet? ...Huh. Those fashion tips were surprisingly helpful.
Edgeworth:
(It's supposed to be an investigation report, though...)
Cell phone
Edgeworth:
I assume this is the victim's cell phone.
Kay:
That's right! Umm, apparently Mr. Cameron gave his eyewitness testimony over the cell phone.
Edgeworth:
What do you mean by "over the cell phone"?
Lang:
After Cameron found the president, it seems that he called his girlfriend. But she didn't answer the phone, so Cameron left a message on her answering machine.
Kay:
The tape is in the case files too. You wanna hear it?
Edgeworth:
Please.
Cameron:
Hello, Jill? Are you asleep already? I'm in front of the facility now, but... something's not right. President Huang is here of all places. And what's more... Crap. The light just went off. I can barely see a thing now. I can't believe it, but it almost looks like he's being kidnapped. I thought I'd let you know...
Edgeworth:
What was that sound at the end...?
Lang:
It seems he was attacked while he was still on the phone.
Courtney:
Agent Lang, may I ask... ...what was the name of Mr. Cameron's beloved?
Lang:
I'm pretty sure I heard her name was Jill Crane.
Courtney:
So, it was true...
Kay:
D-Did you say Jill!?
Edgeworth:
This was why she was seeking revenge for 12 long years...
Courtney:
The feelings and the items Ms. Crane inherited from her beloved... ...brought her to the auction. She had come to exact revenge on the Conductor... Blaise.
Kay:
But, Ms. Crane tried to get revenge on Blaise, right?
Edgeworth:
She may have wanted to get revenge on him for covering up the kidnapping case. Or perhaps she thought Blaise himself was the kidnapper.
Cameron's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.
Body
Edgeworth:
Jack Cameron was a freelance journalist. He was killed because he witnessed the president's kidnapping.
Kay:
The blood really stands out in the re-creation. It's giving me the heebie-jeebies...
Edgeworth:
Even in the original photo, it looks brutal enough. ...A lot of blood was spilled. The back of his head is covered in blood. That must be where all the blood spilled from.
Kay:
According to the autopsy report, he was struck in the back of the head with a brick...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It's likely that the killer approached Mr. Cameron from behind. Hm? Is the victim holding something in his right hand?
Kay:
That's also written in the case files! Umm... It seems he was holding onto a button.
Edgeworth:
(A button? Did he tear it off the culprit's clothes?)
Bloodstain Button data jotted down in my Organizer.
Camera
Edgeworth:
Hmm. The victim was carrying a camera.
Kay:
Oh! According to the case files, it seems he only managed to take a single photo. Umm... Here it is!
Edgeworth:
Th-This is...!
Kay:
I-Isn't that the president!?
Edgeworth:
He's being held at gunpoint. (This must be the scene the victim witnessed...!)
Kay:
So, the person in the coat must be the kidnapper!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It seems like some sort of disguise. (If the logic of Agent Lang's father is correct... ...then this person should be Patricia Roland...)
Kay:
But, why's there only one photo?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps he was killed before he could take any more...?
Cameron's Photo data jotted down in my Organizer.
Brick
Edgeworth:
This is the brick that was used as the murder weapon (Murder weapon: Brick - Found near Cameron's body. Did it come from the facility grounds?).
Kay:
You can find bricks like this all over the garden... They must have used one of them as a weapon.
Footprints on right side
Edgeworth:
The footprints here seem to lead to and from the body.
Kay:
These footprints were believed to be the culprit's. The shoe size is about a size 7. That's fairly average. It seems we won't be able to tell who the culprit is from these footprints.
Melted snowman
Edgeworth:
This... has mostly melted, but it appears to be a snowman?
Kay:
It has a scarf and a hat. It must have melted since it was dressed so warmly. The poor thing has even lost one of the buttons that was used for its eyes.
Edgeworth:
The temperature reaches its lowest point at dawn. Perhaps it would have refrozen later.
Kay:
He he he. Not so fast, Mr. Edgeworth! Once a snowman melts, even if it freezes up again... ...it becomes an iceman, instead of a snowman!
Edgeworth:
(Ngh...! Wh-Whaaaat!? Is that what she was expecting me to say?)
Shi-Long Lang
Lang:
........ Three flowerbeds... and snow...
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang? What's the matter?
Lang:
...Something's strange. I wasn't able to read the SS-5 Incident case files until now.
Edgeworth:
Since Blaise had all access to that information restricted.
Lang:
Yeah, that's right. And yet, I feel like I've seen this exact scene somewhere before...
Edgeworth:
What do you mean?
Lang:
Where did I see this? If I could just remember...
Edgeworth:
(He looks deep in thought... I should leave him alone for a while.)
Father and the president
Lang:
After the SS-5 Incident... the president completely changed. Well... He must have felt like his trust had been betrayed. I guess it's only natural. He cut off all ties with the Lang clan, putting an end to our deep bond of trust. My old man wanted to at least apologize in some way... ...so he tried to go see the president more times than I can count. Of course, the president refused to meet with him. He wouldn't even give him the time of day. I don't know if it was from the bodyguards, but there were times he'd come back all beaten up. ...Hmph. But me standing around talking about the past doesn't do jack, does it?
Edgeworth:
I shall be the judge of that. For now, just keep telling us what you know.
Lang:
You're still as tactless as ever. Well, I figured you'd say as much.
The SS-5 Incident
Lang:
The fall of my old man was also the fall of the Lang clan. "The family that failed to protect the president." ...That's what we became. My old man started to investigate the case like he was possessed.
Edgeworth:
...Could someone so driven by obsession truly conduct a proper investigation?
Lang:
Sheesh... You really don't pull your punches, Mr. Prosecutor. Don't think I blindly trusted in his investigation just because he's my old man. His investigation was meticulous down to the last detail. Apparently, he even conducted a thorough interview with each and every kid at the orphanage.
Edgeworth:
(He interviewed every child... I wonder how fruitful his results were.)
Present
SS-5 Incident Files, Cameron's Autopsy Report, Cameron's Testimony or Cameron's Photo
Lang:
The SS-5 Incident that occurred 12 years ago... I guess I should tell you everything. My old man failed to protect the country's number one VIP. Because of that... ...he put everything on the line in his hunt for the culprit after the incident. During that time, my old man... He was like a lifeless ghost. If he had just caught his prey, he might have been able to forgive himself. But... that shrew, Roland, she managed to get away scot-free! My old man couldn't repay his debt to the president, nor could he unravel the case... And so began the nightmare that our wolf pack still haven't woken up from to this day. Satisfied?
Edgeworth:
(When his clan's honor was damaged, young Lang's heart was wounded just as badly. Agent Lang. I can sympathize with your father's regrets. However...) ...all we can do is perform a thorough investigation of this case. I hope your words will serve as some kind of clue.
Lang:
Tch! That's all you have to say!? Sheesh. All that talking was a real waste of time.
Fire
Lang:
What kind of pup dumps out kerosene and lights it on fire as a prank?
Kay:
Thanks to that, some valuable evidence for this case has gone up in smoke.
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. Your father relentlessly investigated the SS-5 Incident. During his investigation, did he find any information on the child who started the fire?
Lang:
So you noticed it too, huh? Truth is, I've thought about the same thing myself. But...
Edgeworth:
Your father never revealed his own thoughts to anyone... Is that right?
Lang:
Yeah, that's right. The truth is like a needle hidden in a haystack...
Edgeworth:
(It seems his feelings on the matter are more complicated than he lets on...)
Kay:
Heh heh heh... Mr. Lang! Haven't you forgotten something important? A wolf's nose should be able to sniff out the truth from a haystack!
Lang:
...Tch! Hahahahahahaha! You're right. To think the little crow-girl would be the one to tell me that.
Edgeworth:
(She is my assistant for good reason...)
Kay:
I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant for good reason, you know!
MIB
MIB:
Shifu. I know it's not my place, but I have a request. Please... Do a roll call, just like old times!
Lang:
Just like old times, huh? Heh. What a lark... Guess I have no choice. Roll call!
MIB:
1! ...... I-I'm sorry. A roll call with one person is really lacking...
Lang:
That's nonsense. It's got nothing to do with numbers. Even though you're the only one here, the pack is always one, right? If you think it's lacking, then howl loud enough to make up for the rest of the pack! Roll call!
MIB:
1! 1! 1... O... ne...
Edgeworth:
(That man... Is he on the verge of tears?)
Igloo
Kay:
This bear-shaped igloo is both cute and scary at the same time. I hereby declare this a beargloo!
Edgeworth:
Hmm. It looks as though this igloo could fit three people inside.
Kay:
Yeah. I bet you could live up to three years in this beargloo!
Edgeworth:
Three years? What about the summertime? The bea... The igloo would melt.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Say that again! Say that one more time!
Edgeworth:
The igloo would melt.
Kay:
Tsk.
Franziska von Karma and Dick Gumshoe
Franziska:
...Scruffy! Don't you dare say a word. I'm warning you!
Gumshoe:
Eek! Mr. Edgeworth! P-Please help me, sir!
Edgeworth:
What is it, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
It's about the story behind this "SS-5 Incident", sir! Even though Blaise may have lost his authority... ...there's no way you can get confidential documents this quickly. That got me curious, so I made a few calls and asked around... ...and I found out that Ms. von Karma used all sorts of forceful tactics to...
Franziska:
Scruffy! I thought I warned you!
Gumshoe:
Aiiieeeee!
Edgeworth:
(...You've done a lot for us, Franziska. I promise I will bring this to an end with my own hands.)
Raymond Shields
Ray:
This scene sure puts a chill in your bones. Uncle Ray needs a hot babe to keep him warm.
Kay:
...Could you please try to be a little more serious?
Ray:
Oh? If that's what Kay wants, I guess I have no choice. Miles. This is where it all began... Isn't that right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. I fear that is the case.
Ray:
What was Patricia and Blaise's true goal? There are still many mysteries yet to be solved.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It is just as you say.
Ray:
Particularly, the mystery of... What will happen to Kay-Ray's love!? Isn't it suspectful?
Kay:
Not even a little. ...You just couldn't resist, could you, Mr. Shields!? Why can't you ever stay serious for more than a minute!?
Edgeworth:
(I think he's genuinely incapable of staying serious for that long.)
Spring riders
Edgeworth:
These playground toys are modeled after a hare and a tortoise, like from the fable. The tortoise and the hare competed in race, and in the end the hare lost.
Kay:
And now, for something completely different... It's time for a Kay Quiz! Why did the hare lose? There are three choices!
Edgeworth:
(Hmph. I already know the answer. It's because the hare took a nap...)
Kay:
1) The hare's favorite shoes were stolen by the Yatagarasu. 2) The tortoise trained with the Yatagarasu until it became faster than the hare. 3) Unbeknownst to the two animals, the Yatagarasu stole the victory from the shadows!
Edgeworth:
(Those are my only choices...?)
Kay:
Is it too hard for you? 'Kay, I'll give you a hint. It starts with a "th"!
Edgeworth:
(Sh-She wants me to pick number 3...)
(Connecting all possible Logic, examining two footprints, burnt pillar, cell phone, body, brick and camera, talking to Lang leads to:)
Edgeworth:
We've learned pretty much all that we can about the situation at the time of the murder.
Kay:
Oh! In that case, is there another scene you'd like to re-create?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Would you do the honors? I would like you to re-create the scene when the victim witnessed the president's kidnapping.
Kay:
Right! I'll re-create the scene based on Mr. Cameron's photo!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Cameron is standing in the middle of the flowerbeds...
Kay:
...and the president and his kidnapper are standing on the road.
Lang:
My old man based his initial investigation on this man's eyewitness testimony. As a result, it led him to believe that the kidnapping and this facility were related.
Edgeworth:
And that's how... he came to suspect the head of the orphanage, Patricia Roland.
Lang:
Yeah... But in court, Blaise Debeste treated this testimony as if it meant nothing.
Edgeworth:
Why would he do that?
Lang:
The president and his kidnapper were not standing inside the orphanage grounds. So a connection between the orphanage and the kidnapping was difficult to prove.
Kay:
I see. It's not like they were seen inside the orphanage, after all...
Lang:
Tch! No matter how much evidence the detectives gather at the crime scene... ...it doesn't mean squat if the prosecutor won't use it in court! Blaise Debeste had some kind of connection with Patricia Roland. I figure they had some kind of deal going on.
Kay:
In other words, you think that Blaise was one of the kidnappers (Was Blaise a kidnapper? Blaise had Patricia found not guilty. Were they partners in crime?)?
Edgeworth:
However, your father was convinced that Patricia Roland was the culprit... Your father was a highly capable investigator, I presume? Might he have had some other basis for his conclusion besides the eyewitness testimony?
Lang:
Yeah... I figure he did. But I have no idea what it was. My old man never really talked much about this case...
Edgeworth:
(Agent Lang's father, Dai-Long Lang... President Huang's most trusted confidant. The truth he discovered was suppressed by Blaise Debeste. First, we must find that hidden truth...)
Logic
"What did Blaise dig up?" and "Was Blaise a kidnapper?"
Edgeworth:
If we suppose that Blaise was one of the kidnappers... ...it becomes more likely that what he dug up yesterday is connected to the abduction.
Kay:
Ah!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What is it!?
Kay:
I've figured it out! It was treasure! Treasure! Couldn't Blaise have dug up the ransom money?
Edgeworth:
The 100 million dollar ransom... ...buried in the ground until the head had died down. It's certainly possible.
Kay:
I know, right!?
Monster's Footprints data updated in my Organizer.
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Change Re-creation (while recreating Moment of the Incident)
Kay:
So you want to re-create the scene based on the "police investigation" data? This is the Time the Body Was Discovered, when the police were investigating the scene!
Kay:
I've re-created the scene!
Change Re-creation (while recreating Time the Body was Discovered)
Kay:
So you want to re-create the scene based on the "Mr. Cameron's eyewitness testimony"? This is the Time the Body Was Discovered, when the president was being kidnapped!
Kay:
I've re-created the scene!
Using Little Thief
Kay:
Oh! You wanna hear about the Little Thief's newest feature?
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Not particularly.
Kay:
Wha...!? C'mon, don't say that! Using the latest feature, we can now re-create the scene at different times.
Edgeworth:
(She just went ahead and started explaining it...)
Kay:
Right now, we can re-create the scene based on the "police investigation report"... ...and "Mr. Cameron's eyewitness testimony"! Please let me know whenever you want to switch scenes!
Mr. Cameron's photo
Kay:
I re-created the scene based on Mr. Cameron's photo... Doesn't something seem off to you?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. If you compare the re-creation with the information we've gathered... ...there appears to be a clear contradiction.
Kay:
Oh! I knew something was off.
Edgeworth:
Let's compare the evidence we have on hand... ...with the scene re-created from the photograph.
Scene of Cameron being killed
Edgeworth:
Cameron took a photo of the president from this spot...
Kay:
...and he also called Ms. Crane, right?
Edgeworth:
At that time, the killer was already behind him.
Kay:
Holding the murderous brick...
Scene of Huang being kidnapped
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Street lamp
Kay:
This is the photo he took... but it looks kinda dark. I guess he wasn't able to bring out the subject's charm and make it a brighter photo.
Edgeworth:
Kay. The reason this photo is so dark is not because of the subject... It's because the street lamp nearby was broken, you see?
Kay:
Huh? A-Aaah! So you don't have to rely on natural lighting, you can use lamps to light up the subject! I never thought about that! Nice one, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(I don't think she understood what I was trying to tell her...)
Snowman
Kay:
Umm, about this snowman... When we re-created the scene where Mr. Cameron was killed, it has already melted. Its scarf was all soggy, and one of its button eyes was missing.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. At this stage, it appears that most of its original form was still intact. Although, there's one spot that looks unnaturally lacking...
Kay:
Poor thing! I bet some naughty kid must've plucked it off. Although, from a thief's perspective, that kid does have some promise.
Edgeworth:
(Was it plucked off by one of the children at the orphanage? No, perhaps... ...it was taken by an entirely different person altogether...?)
Di-Jun Huang
Edgeworth:
Di-Jun Huang. 12 years ago, he was still the president of Zheng Fa.
Kay:
Doesn't he seem a bit younger? Though it might be hard to tell, since it's so dark.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. And with the situation being what it was, his facial expression seems a bit strained.
Kay:
I wonder where the president was taken after this?
Edgeworth:
We don't know that yet. However, if the answer to that question lies here... ...it should become clear when we continue the investigation.
Kidnapper
Edgeworth:
It's the president's kidnapper. Let's try drawing out whatever we can from their appearance.
Kay:
Right, I got it! Their appearance, their appearance...
Edgeworth:
First things first. The kidnapper threatened the president with a gun.
Kay:
Look at how they're holding the gun, it's like they're trying to show it off. Totally not cool!
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, we cannot see the person's face because it's hidden by their coat and hat.
Kay:
And look at that popped collar, it's like they're trying to be all that. Totally not cool!
Edgeworth:
Their body seems relaxed, suggesting that they had a composed mental state.
Kay:
Thet even have one hand stuffed in their pocket. Totally not cool at all!
Edgeworth:
Kay. I'm sorry, but that's...
Kay:
...stuff I've drawn out from their appearance!
Edgeworth:
(...That may be true, but...)
Deduce (after examining Snowman)
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce snowman and present Bloodstained Button
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"This snowman... Wouldn't you say it's missing something?"
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
Compare this piece of evidence to the state of this area. Do you notice anything?
Kay:
Hmm... I think I do... Aha! I noticed that your logic is wrong!
Edgeworth:
Ngh! (It seems I was wrong after all...)
Kay:
Let's double check the area for anything out of place! Perhaps there's something that's related to the evidence we have!
Edgeworth:
This snowman... Wouldn't you say it's missing something?
Kay:
Ah! Its right eye is missing!
Edgeworth:
Precisely. And what's more, that missing eye happens to be in our possession.
Kay:
The button that Mr. Cameron was holding onto! It's got the exact same design as the snowman's left eye!
Edgeworth:
If we assume this button was indeed the snowman's eye... ...a huge contradiction arises. If this button is the snowman's eye, what contradiction arises?
The location of the victim
Leads to:
"The victim was holding onto the button. Furthermore, the button was stained with blood."
The location of the snowman
Edgeworth:
It contradicts with the location of the snowman!
Kay:
So, you mean the snowman was actually in the middle of the garden? But, there were no signs that it was moved, right?
Edgeworth:
Gah! (So it wasn't this... If the button used as the snowman's eye was grabbed by the victim... ...there can only be one answer!)
Leads back to:
"If this button is the snowman's eye, what contradiction arises?"
The location of the president
Edgeworth:
It contradicts with the location of the president!
Kay:
The location of the president? But, I thought the president had nothing to do with the button...
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (It seems I was wrong... If the button used as the snowman's eye was grabbed by the victim... ...there can only be one answer!)
Leads back to:
"If this button is the snowman's eye, what contradiction arises?"
Edgeworth:
The victim was holding onto the button. Furthermore, the button was stained with blood. In other words, he grabbed the button after he was attacked. For example, if we were to picture it in this way... After being struck in the back of the head, Mr. Cameron lost his balance. As he was falling, he reached out his hand towards the nearby snowman. However, it could not support his weight, and he collapsed while still grasping the button.
Kay:
Huh!? Th-That means... ...Mr. Cameron was near the snowman when he was attacked!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. At the very least, he must have been within arm's reach, however... ...it's quite clear that he would not have been able to reach it from his current position.
Kay:
But! Mr. Cameron's footprints only lead towards the flowerbed!
Edgeworth:
Can we be certain that those footprints really are Mr. Cameron's...? It seems we'll need to investigate them one more time.
Kay:
Understood! I'll re-create the Time the Body Was Discovered scene one more time!
Kay:
These footprints should match up with Mr. Cameron's shoes, right?
Edgeworth:
Let's inspect them again.
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
The three disasters
Kay:
A kidnapping, a murder, and a fire on top of that. So much thing happened that it's hard to keep things straight...
Edgeworth:
The fire was caused by a child on the evening of the incident. Which means, the fire occurred before the kidnapping and the murder.
Kay:
Did you notice something about when the fire started?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. There's one thing that caught my attention. (If the fire occurred first, then something left at the crime scene should not have been there. What has changed at the scene due to the fire, and the evidence that I have on hand... It seems I'll need to take a moment to compare the two.)
Footprints on left
Edgeworth:
These footprints... Are they really Mr. Cameron's?
Kay:
They're from size 11 shoes, and these huge footprints match up with Mr. Cameron's shoes. No matter how you look at it, they're moving steadily towards the center of the flowerbeds.
Edgeworth:
But when Mr. Cameron was attacked, he grabbed the button from the snowman.
Kay:
Even with a Great Thief's peak human conditioning, your arm just can't stretch that far. Let alone an ordinary civilian, it'd be completely impossible.
Edgeworth:
(The footprints come from the shoes worn by the victim, just as the case files say. ...However, does that mean Mr. Cameron was the owner of these shoes? We should re-examine Mr. Cameron's shoes.)
Body
Before examining shoes
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining shoes
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Shoes
Edgeworth:
(These shoes should match the footprints, however...) Hm? These shoes... it seems like they were not the ones originally worn by the victim.
Kay:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
If you look closely, you'll see the laces were tied up strangely. And the size doesn't seem to fit quite right either.
Victim's Shoes data jotted down in my Organizer.
Kay:
That would mean, these huge footprints leading up to the victim's feet...
Edgeworth:
...were most likely made by someone other than the victim.
Kay:
So then. the footprints leading to and from the victim's head must be Mr. Cameron's.
Edgeworth:
No, not necessarily. They seem a little too small to be the victim's footprints.
Kay:
So none of the footprints are his...? Then, which way did Mr. Cameron walk from?
Edgeworth:
It's quite simple. The victim did not walk here on his own accord, but rather... ...he was carried here (Body was moved - There are signs that Cameron's body was carried from somewhere.) after he was murdered, by the culprit. (The question now becomes, where was he killed and carried from... Perhaps it was near the snowman after all?)
Melted snowman
Edgeworth:
(Mr. Cameron's body was moved. If we consider the button he was holding on to... ...it's highly likely that he was killed near this snowman. I should take a closer look.)
Before examining gap between the bricks
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining gap between the bricks
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Footprints
Kay:
There are some size 7 footprints going back and forth. According to the police files, these are the culprit's footprints.
Edgeworth:
Indeed... They seem to grow faint and disappear as they approach the road.
Kay:
There's not much snow left on the road after all.
Edgeworth:
As expected, it'll be difficult to determine who these footprints belong to.
Melted snowman
Kay:
This snowman has become a sad sight to look at.
Edgeworth:
It can't be helped. Snow and ice both melt away with time.
Kay:
Just like the mysteries of the cases you've solved, Mr. Edgeworth! As time passes, those mysteries melt away while you continue to keep your cool!
Edgeworth:
(You do realize I'm wracking my brain trying to solve those mysteries during a case...)
Plants
Edgeworth:
It appears that the outside of the facility was also decorated with flowerbeds.
Kay:
Wow. So there are flowers that bloom in the winter. Snow has even piled up on the flowerbed.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It seems a little cold, and it gives off a refined taste. Even though it's just a re-creation.
Kay:
Indeed. It gives off a little cold, and tastes quite refined. Even though it's just a re-creation.
Edgeworth:
As expected, it'll be difficult to determine who these footprints belong to.
Gap between the bricks
Kay:
Huh? There's a brick missing here (Missing brick - One of the bricks near the snowman is missing.).
Edgeworth:
The rests are all in order. It's strange that only this one is missing.
Moment of the Incident
Burnt pillar
Kay:
According to the files, it seems there was a fire on the evening of the incident.
Edgeworth:
A fire?
Kay:
Umm. Let's see here... huh!? It says that one of the children at the orphanage spilled kerosene and set it on fire as a prank.
Edgeworth:
I guess that kid had far too much energy... And thanks to that, we can't make out any of the footprints near the main hall... The place Cameron was killed was not near the flowerbeds.
Kay:
So then, whose blood is this...?
Edgeworth:
Just now, the state of the re-creation has changed completely. Regarding this bloodstain... ...the Time the Body Was Discovered scene has probably been greatly impacted as a result.
Kay:
Then, let's go check it out right away! Preparations are ready!
Edgeworth:
(Since the state of the re-creation has changed once again... ...I should press the Y Button and select Change Re-creation. Let's give it a try.)
Snowman
Kay:
It's the one-eyed snowman. It goes all the way up to my shoulders! At this size, it's a Gigaton class! You gotta hand it to the kids who made this.
Edgeworth:
..I was hoping for some more diverse information, instead of just its size.
Kay:
A bucket hat, button eyes, and a wool scarf. It's fully equipped! All that's left is to knock it down with countless punches and kicks!
Edgeworth:
...I was hoping for some more objective information, instead of what you'd like to do to it.
Scene of Huang being kidnapped
Edgeworth:
This is the president just before he was kidnapped at gunpoint.
Kay:
The president was strong, but there's no way he'd win against a gun.
Edgeworth:
And Mr. Cameron photographed this scene from the middle of the flowerbeds... There's something highly unnatural about this.
Kay:
It would've been impossible for him to grab the snowman's button from there!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. We should examine the state of the other re-creation once more.
Time the Body Was Discovered
Logic
"Murder weapon: Brick" and "Missing brick"
Edgeworth:
Perhaps the missing brick (Brick near the snowman - The brick used to kill Cameron was from near the snowman.) was the one used as the murder weapon.
Kay:
Ah! Yeah, it seems to be just the right size to fit in that gap perfectly!
"Body was moved" and "Brick near the snowman"
Leads to:
"As I thought, it seems the murder actually occurred near the snowman."
Edgeworth:
As I thought, it seems the murder actually occurred near the snowman.
Kay:
Both the button Mr. Cameron was holding and the murder weapon came from there...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Also, if we assume that the killer picked up the brick near the snowman... ...and then tried to sneak up behind Mr. Cameron...
Kay:
Oh! Mr. Cameron totally would've seen the person picking up the brick!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. Kay. Please update the re-creation. Mr. Cameron was not in the middle of the flowerbeds, but near the snowman.
Kay:
'Kay! I'm on it!
Bloodstain
Edgeworth:
The place Cameron was killed was not hear the flowerbeds.
Kay:
So then, whose blood is this...?
Edgeworth:
We'll have to investigate this bloodstain in more detail later, however... ...for now, our top priority is to ensure that the re-creation of the crime scene is complete. Let's confirm the location of all parties involved once again.
Scene
Leads to:
"No matter how you look at it, this is strange."
Kay:
No matter how you look at it, this is strange.
Edgeworth:
All the people involved in the case are gathered in the same place.
Kay:
Did we make a mistake here or something?
Edgeworth:
(One piece of evidence this re-creation is based on is odd. If I had to choose which piece of evidence is fake... Which piece of evidence is likely to be fake...?)
Present Cameron's Photo
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Was this photo... really taken by Mr. Cameron?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Kay. Take a look at this evidence.
Kay:
Don't tell me you're gonna say this piece of evidence is fake! No matter how you look at it, I don't think that's right.
Edgeworth:
Argh! (So I was wrong...)
Kay:
The people involved in this case couldn't have all been in one place, right? If we've proved that this was the spot where Mr. Cameron was actually standing...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It means "that" piece of evidence must be fake.
Leads back to:
"(Which piece of evidence is likely to be fake...?)"
Edgeworth:
Was this photo... really taken by Mr. Cameron?
Kay:
Ehhh!? What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
We have proven that whoever killed Mr. Cameron also moved the body. For what reason would they have to deliberately move his body? Perhaps the culprit wanted to falsify the scene that Mr. Cameron witnessed.
Kay:
And that's why they took a fake photo?
Edgeworth:
They made the president stand under the street light, and took a photo with Cameron's camera. It would have been quite simple.
Kay:
Now that you mention it... Mr. Cameron's camera only had one photo on it, right?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. In all likelihood, the original roll of film had been removed from the camera... ...and after loading a new roll of film into the camera, the fake photo was taken.
Kay:
I see! So, this photo must've been taken after Mr. Cameron was killed, right?
Cameron's Photo data updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Exactly. This was not the scene Mr. Cameron actually witnessed. It's likely that this photo is forged evidence!
Kay:
Then, where did Mr. Cameron witness the president and his kidnapper?
Edgeworth:
The photo isn't the only piece of evidence that indicates what Mr. Cameron witnessed...
Kay:
Ah! The testimony he left on the answering machine!
Edgeworth:
Precisely. We should listen to the recording one more time and confirm what was said. (Where else could the president and his kidnapper have been?)
Present under the up-left lamp
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Mr. Cameron said this on the answering machine..."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Kay:
They were over there!? So, what's the basis for that claim?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Do I really need a basis for my claims?
Kay:
In other words, you don't know, do you?
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (So It wasn't there...)
Kay:
Let's try remembering what Mr. Cameron said in his eyewitness testimony! Didn't he say something about the situation at the scene?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Mr. Cameron's testimony should provide a major clue.
Leads back to:
"(Where else could the president and his kidnapper have been?)"
Edgeworth:
Mr. Cameron said this on the answering machine... "The light just went off. I can barely see a thing now." There are only two places here where the lights are broken...
Kay:
The light by the orphanage!
Edgeworth:
Kay. Could you please update the re-creation?
Kay:
Roger!
Lang:
This is...! So the kidnapper was near the orphanage!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. With this, we've shown the connection between the orphanage and the kidnapping.
Lang:
So that's why they moved the body and took a fake photo to create false testimony! In order to remove any suspicion towards the orphanage in court!
Edgeworth:
...Hmm. With this, the state of the re-creation has changed completely. The Time the Body Was Discovered scene has probably been greatly impacted as a result.
Kay:
Then, let's go check it out right away! Preparations are ready!
Edgeworth:
(Since the state of the re-creation has changed once again... ...I should press the Y Button and select Change Re-creation. Let's give it a try.)
Scene of Huang being kidnapped
Kay:
So this is where the president and his kidnapper were really seen.
Edgeworth:
That is correct. However, now the orphanage can no longer avoid suspicion in the kidnapping. That's why it was necessary to distance the kidnapping site from the orphanage grounds.
Kay:
Oooh... sneaky. So that's why they took the fake photo!
Edgeworth:
They disposed of Cameron's film and threatened the president near the road. Then, using new film, they took the false photograph.
Kay:
If Blaise was in league with the kidnappers, he could conceal any incriminating evidence.
Edgeworth:
In fact, the SS-5 Incident case files had been sealed away until Blaise's recent downfall.
Kay:
Oooh. The truth of this case is being revealed, little by little!
Edgeworth:
Indeed... (However, some mysteries still remain. We'll need to thoroughly investigate any changes in the previous re-creation.)
Bloodstain
Edgeworth:
The place Cameron was killed was not near the flowerbeds.
Kay:
So then, whose blood is this...?
Edgeworth:
Just now, the state of the re-creation has changed completely. Regarding this bloodstain... ...the Time the Body Was Discovered scene has probably been greatly impacted as a result.
Kay:
Then, let's go check it out right away! Preparations are ready!
Edgeworth:
(Since the state of the re-creation has changed once again... ...I should press the Y Button and select Change Re-creation. Let's give it a try.)
Scene of Cameron being killed
Edgeworth:
There's no mistaking it. Mr. Cameron was originally here when he took the photo. The killer took a brick from that flowerbed and attacked him. Mr. Cameron was hit in the back of the head, and grabbed the snowman's right eye as he fell.
Kay:
And since we now know that Mr. Cameron's body was here... ...the state of the other re-creation must have changed as well.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. In that case, perhaps we should go and investigate it.
Time the Body Was Discovered
Body
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Originally, Mr. Cameron's body was here. In order to be consistent with the fake photo... ...he was moved to the center of the flowerbeds.
Kay:
Then, the footprints going back and forth from the body, could theu be!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. There's only one possibility at the moment... These footprints were probably left when the body was moved to the flowerbeds.
Bloodstain
Before deducing
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After deducing
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Dirt ground
Kay:
This seems to be the only area without any snow.
Edgeworth:
It must have been melted by the fire caused by the child at the orphanage.
Kay:
The disasters just kept coming for this orphanage. After the fire, multiple murders occurred.
Edgeworth:
(Hm? After the fire...? If the snow had melted, wouldn't that mean...?)
Bloodstain
Edgeworth:
The blood splatter above the snow.. There certainly was a substantial amount. It's almost as if the murder was actually committed here...
Kay:
But, Mr. Cameron should have been attacked near the snowman!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. In that case, this blood must belong to someone else.
Kay:
Whaaat!? But, the police reports said this was Mr. Cameron's blood...
Edgeworth:
The one in charge of this case was Blaise Debeste. It would have been simple for him to falsify that information.
Kay:
But! Wouldn't it be faster to just clean up the bloodstains, rather than falsify the information?
Edgeworth:
He wouldn't be able to do that. Think about it... Blaise knew that Mr. Cameron's body would be discovered here. In which case, the forensic department would naturally become involved.
Kay:
Ah! A luminol reaction! They would've discovered it with the power of science!
Edgeworth:
Precisely. It would have been difficult to completely erase all traces of the blood. However, falsifying the results of a blood test would be much easier in comparison. He would just have to switch the results from the forensics reports.
Kay:
Aww, what a bummer... Knowing those documents I read were falsified. Err, it looks like Mr. Cameron's clothes were completely soaked in blood.
Edgeworth:
Hmm. If the blood scattered here got onto Cameron's clothes... ...that would mean, at the time, the bloodstains here had not dried yet.
Kay:
I see. So then, this certain somebody's blood... ...was splattered here just a short while before Mr. Cameron was murdered!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. That's exactly right. (However, if that's the case... ...wouldn't a new contradiction arise in this re-creation...?)
Mysterious Bloodstain data jotted down in my Organizer.
Snow around the bloodstain
Kay:
...So then, I've placed the body near the snowman. Now that he's gone, it feels a little lonely around here.
Edgeworth:
(That's not a very proper way of putting it...) Since the body isn't here, we might be able to find some new clues. Let's thoroughly investigate this area.
Kay:
Aye aye, Mr. Edgeworth!
Deduce (after examining bloodstain)
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce bloodstain and present Fire
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"This is a clear contradiction!"
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
This evidence clearly contradicts the state of this area!
Kay:
Oh! And specifically, where does the contradiction lie!?
Edgeworth:
Umm. Around here, perhaps?
Kay:
If you don't know, just say so...
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (I should think this over one more time.)
Kay:
So the snow was melted by the fire? We should keep in mind when exactly the fire started and take a closer look at the area!
Edgeworth:
This is a clear contradiction!
Kay:
Huh? You mean this bloodstain?
Edgeworth:
Do you see how this bloodstain is broken up by the remains of the fire? This is proof that the fire occurred after the blood had scattered around the area.
Kay:
Huh? But I thought the fire occurred before the murder...?
Edgeworth:
It seems that information is suspect as well. If the fire had broken out after the murder...
Lang:
! ...then the child who started the fire should have seen the body and the bloodstains.
Edgeworth:
Why then, did they not come forward as a witness? It's likely that would have put Blaise at a great disadvantage!
Lang:
Guess we'll need to investigate this fire in more detail. Hey, you!
MIB:
Yes, sir!
Lang:
There should be some records of the fire in the police department under a different case file! I want you to bring me every last investigation report about the fire!
MIB:
Understood, Shifu!
Lang:
Oh, and one more thing...
MIB:
What is it, sir?
Lang:
Contact the House of Lang in Zheng Fa. There should be evidence from this case in my old man's room.
Edgeworth:
What do you mean?
Lang:
I just remembered... why I recognize this scene. A long time ago, I saw a picture in my old man's room. It was a drawing resembling this scene...
Edgeworth:
What did you say!?
Lang:
However, I think it looked like something a child drew.
Edgeworth:
A child...? Then the artist may have been the culprit behind the fire.
Lang:
It should still be somewhere in my old man's room. Have them send it over here.
MIB:
Understood, sir!
(Connecting all possible Logic and deducing bloodstain leads to:)
Investigation Complete
MIB:
Shifu! I'm back! I've brought the info on the fire the kid started and a photo of the drawing in your father's office... And also...
Lang:
Oh, I've been waiting for this! Hurry up and hand 'em over!
Edgeworth:
(The information held by Agent Lang's father...!)
Lang:
This is it...! It's exactly what I remembered!
Edgeworth:
...This was the picture drawn by the child, depicting the night of the incident?
Kay:
It sure looks like it was drawn with a child's touch!
Edgeworth:
As I thought, the one who drew this... is most likely the child who started the fire.
Child's Drawing data jotted down in my Organizer.
MIB:
...Sh-Shifu!
Lang:
What now? Sorry, but it's gonna have to wait. ...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Why do you think my old man had this?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps he obtained it during the course of his investigation into the incident. Although I don't know why he would have concealed it... Agent Lang. Might I be able to see the details of the fire?
Lang:
Yeah, sure.
Edgeworth:
Allow me to read it posthaste. The boy who started the fire snuck out of bed on the night of the incident. Hm? It seems this boy went missing several days later.
Lang:
What? Don't tell me that he witnessed something he shouldn't have?
Kay:
That's horrible! He was only a child, after all!
Edgeworth:
(While I'd hate for that to be the case, we can't rule out the possibility entirely.)
Lang:
Huh? Apparently, the boy left some stuff behind at the orphanage, and it was taken as evidence... What's this...?
Edgeworth:
Th-That's...! (What's that doing here?)
Lang:
Hm? Mr. Prosecutor. Do you recognize this?
Edgeworth:
Yes... I know one piece of evidence that's related to it. Which piece of evidence is related to what the boy left behind?
Present Moozilla Doll
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I don't know what it's doing here..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Lang:
You're saying this thing's related to that piece of evidence?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. There is no doubt in my mind.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
You seriously think that? Lang Zi says: "Soy sauce in cream puffs!" In other words, I can't see how these two things go together at all!
Edgeworth:
...Gwaaah! (So that wasn't it...? There should be something like this among the evidence. I'll need to compare it with the evidence one more time...)
Lang:
How about it, Mr. Prosecutor? Do you recognize this thing?
Leads back to:
"Which piece of evidence is related to what the boy left behind?"
Edgeworth:
I don't know what it's doing here... ...but, isn't that the missing horn from this Moozilla doll?
Lang:
N-No way, you mean, this came off the president's...?
Edgeworth:
You know of it?
Lang:
Yeah. I've noticed the president kept it close by as a decoration. I always thought it was strange how one of the horns was missing.
Edgeworth:
If you twist the horn... this doll will play back any previously recorded audio.
Kay:
So if we put the missing horn back in place... we might be able to hear a different recording!
Edgeworth:
Indeed... It is possible. The doll is currently on the 51st floor of the Great Tower.
Lang:
Hey, you! You heard that, right?
MIB:
Yessir! I'll be right back!
MIB:
Shifu, I've got it! The Mighty Moozilla doll!
Lang:
Well done. Give it to the prosecutor over there.
Edgeworth:
(If we insert the horn found at the orphanage into the doll...)
Kay:
It's a perfect fit!
Lang:
Well? Can you hear anything?
.......Mr. Huang. It's Amy. It's been a while. I saw the news that you would be coming to this country... I was really nervous about doing this, but I decided to send you a message.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
P-Please stop the playback!
Edgeworth:
(Judge Courtney?)
Kay:
Wh-What's wrong!?
Courtney:
Stop it! Now!
It's a boy... Your son. He's just been born. I'm sorry. That's all I wanted to tell you. His name is John. John Marsh... It's a fine name for him, don't you think?
Courtney:
Aah...!
Edgeworth:
M-Marsh...!?
Lang:
Did she say... John?
I'll be waiting in the courtyard of the orphanage at midnight on February 9th. Even if it's just once, I want John to be able to meet you. I'm sorry if I'm being selfish, but... I'll be waiting.
John:
No way... That was my...?
Courtney:
John...
Lang:
What's the meaning of this? Ms. Courtney...
Courtney:
John is... not my biological son. He's... adopted.
Edgeworth:
Did John know about this?
Courtney:
Of course he knew. John's mother... Amy Marsh, passed away about 5 years ago. She and I were cousins. Since we were young, we've always been really close. We were often mistaken for sisters. That's why, when she passed away... ...I thought it was only natural that I look after John. Also... There were circumstances which prevented me from revealing his father's identity. I never even told John his father's name...
John:
......
Edgeworth:
(And now it's all been revealed, thanks to the recording on that doll. Did John's mother send the doll to the president?)
John:
...Hey.
Courtney:
John...!
John:
Was he... the president, really my dad?
Courtney:
.........Yes, he was. Before you were born... Amy worked as a diplomat in Zheng Fa.
Edgeworth:
(A diplomat? So that must be how she became acquainted with President Huang...)
John:
Hang on! Didn't you tell me she worked at the orphanage!?
Courtney:
Yes. After returning to this country, Amy left her job as a diplomat. She always had great passion for charity work... so she began working at the orphanage.
John:
........
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hey... Ms. Courtney... ...So this Amy girl, she called the president there herself, but... ...she never showed up at the scene of the SS-5 Incident. What's with that?
Courtney:
Amy... couldn't make it. Apparently, someone had been following her the whole night.
Edgeworth:
Perhaps it was Blaise? I can't say for certain, but it's possible that it was his doing.
Courtney:
After that, Amy never got another chance to see the president again...
Edgeworth:
(So, she died 5 years ago... This conversation must be painful for John.)
Kay:
Oh right. H-Hey, John, you thirsty? How about I buy us both some juice? We can go together...
John:
I'm a part of this, too. I'll listen until the end. Besides, I can afford to buy my own juice.
Kay:
Oooh! Shot down by a kid...
Courtney:
...John. Do you understand the reason I met with the president two days ago?
Edgeworth:
(The secret meeting from two nights ago...!)
Courtney:
I wanted to tell him. About Amy's death, and... ...that you were alive and well.
John:
But... I-I.....
Edgeworth:
I see. That's why you couldn't tell us your reasons for meeting with the president until now.
Kay:
I get it... She would've had to reveal his connection with John.
Courtney:
I brought a bouquet of lion lilies... ...so that he would understand I truly did know about Amy. Those flowers are a dear memory to the president and Amy. The first present she received from the president was a bouquet of lion lilies. But now, even he has passed away. If only he were still alive... ...perhaps I could have introduced him to John.
John:
..........
MIB:
Shifu! I-I'm sorry to interrupt this atmosphere, but there's something I need to say...
Lang:
Oh, what is it now!? Can't this wait?
MIB:
Well... actually, there's one last item that's been delivered here from Zheng Fa! I have here... the president's will!
Lang:
Wh... What!?
Edgeworth:
(...The president's will?)
Lang:
My old man received a great number of special medals from the president himself... As a token of his trust, the president left his will in the protection of the Lang clan. Those medals and that will, they were the pride of our clan. Our family treasures, so to speak.
Lang:
........ Ngh... Th-This is...!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. Does that will have something to do with the current case?
Lang:
You bet it does. It says here... "I hereby acknowledge John Marsh as my own son."
Hold it!
Courtney:
What...!? John's name is in the president's will...?
Edgeworth:
Are you certain that will was written by the president?
Lang:
Yeah. He entrusted it to the Lang clan even before the SS-5 Incident took place. They'll have to appraise it back home, but by the name of the Lang clan, this is the real deal.
Edgeworth:
(Di-Jun Huang was the president of an entire nation. The existence of his son would have caused... ...considerable controversy. However... he left behind a will, just in case.)
Lang:
This makes it doubly sure. I still can't believe it myself, but there's no room for doubt. John Marsh... You are the son of Di-Jun Huang, President of Zheng Fa.
John:
..............
Courtney:
John!
Edgeworth:
John!
To be continued.
April 6, 4:51 PMOutside Grand TowerTemporary Film Lot
Courtney:
...John.
John:
......So that guy was my dad...
Edgeworth:
(He found out about his own birth so suddenly. And furthermore, his new found father is no longer in this world...)
John:
I'd always been searching for my dad...
Courtney:
...John.
John:
I get it, alright! He's the president. I know it's a complicated situation. But... we even met face to face during the filming. So then, why!? Huh!? Why didn't he tell me who he really was?
Courtney:
I'm sorry. John...
John:
M... Mom, you don't need to apologize. No matter how you look at it, it's all my fault. Yesterday, I broke my promise with you and didn't even notice the fire on the roof... ...so I destroyed everything. I crushed it all. My dad... and those flowers that my mom carefully grew!
Courtney:
John! Please. For now, just don't think about anything. ...Just stay like this for a little while. Just for a little while... OK?
Lang:
..."The bond between a parent and child". That's the meaning behind Lion Lilies. I know it's not my style, but that flowers is from Zheng Fa.
Edgeworth:
(However, we have no means of protecting that bond...) Agent Lang, allow me to say this. The case won't be solved by sentimentality alone. Therefore, shouldn't we do all that we can to solve it?
Lang:
...Yeah. You're right.
Edgeworth:
The re-creation of the past has finished. Were your father's deductions correct?
Lang:
...My old man took his deductions to the grave. He never told anyone about them. So, who knows if they were right or not.
Edgeworth:
In that case, what about your own deductions? I would like to hear what you think happened based on the re-creation. In order for us to get closer to the truth of 12 years ago.
Lang:
Yeah. I was thinking it's about time. I can see it now. My old man's back, real close... I'll catch up to him for sure... ...to the truth that my old man uncovered!
-- Truth of the SS-5 Incident --
Lang:
There's no mistake that the president went to the orphanage.
The stuffed toy is proof of that. He was planning to meet with Amy Marsh.
However, the president was kidnapped. And Cameron just happened to witness it.
If Cameron hadn't been there, it probably would've just been a kidnapping with no murder.
Afterwards, the body was moved to the flowerbeds and a fake photo was taken.
Edgeworth:
(Was that what really happened 12 years ago...?)
SS-5 Incident Case Files updated in my Organizer.
Lang:
However, there's one thing I still don't get.
Edgeworth:
(Something you don't get?)
Lang:
It's this. Why did they need to take a fake photo? Why would they go through all that trouble and even make the president take part in the photo?
Edgeworth:
...That's true. However, the answer to that riddle must lie somewhere within... Once we get past the layers upon layers of deductions, we shall surely reach it.
Lang:
Yeah... That's right. I'd like to hear your deductions as well.
Rebuttal
-- Truth of the SS-5 Incident --
Lang:
There's no mistake that the president went to the orphanage.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. I'd like to verify a few things that may have seemed obvious at first glance. Are we certain that the president actually went to the orphanage?
Lang:
OK, I get it. You're saying you want proof?
Kay:
Everyone's always demanding proof from Mr. Edgeworth, after all.
Edgeworth:
(You didn't have to tell him that...)
Lang:
The stuffed toy is proof of that. He was planning to meet with Amy Marsh.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You mean this stuffed animal? The one with the recording device.
Lang:
That's right. Inside that toy was a recording from John's birthday mother, Amy Marsh...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. She said that she would meet with him at midnight.
Kay:
Wow! You two are perfectly in synch! The truth is becoming clear, like you're peeling off the layers of a scallion!
Edgeworth:
Kay. A scallion doesn't have anything on the inside. Please don't make such foreboding analogies.
Kay:
........ The truth is becoming clear, like you're peeling off the skin of a wolf!
Lang:
C-Can you stop making those foreboding analogies...? ...Ahem. Let's get back on track.
Lang:
However, the president was kidnapped. And Cameron just happened to witness it.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I'd also like to verify the details of this point as much as possible. Mr. Cameron witnessed the president and his kidnapper near the orphanage.
Kay:
And Mr. Cameron was standing by the snowman near the road.
Lang:
Then, the murderer picked up a brick, snuck up on him from behind, and... WHAM!
Kay:
Eeeeeek!
Edgeworth:
Kay. We are simply verifying what actually transpired. There's no need to be scared.
Kay:
...That was so intense. Half the details of this case just vanished from my brain. Mr. Edgeworth. Mr. Lang. Let's carefully verify all the facts of this case!
Lang:
Yeesh... Well, if you're gonna listen, I'll talk as much as you want.
Lang:
If Cameron hadn't been there, it probably would've just been a kidnapping with no murder.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
If he hadn't been there, you say? That's an interesting theory. Care to explain in more detail?
Lang:
It's simple. Cameron was killed because he saw the kidnapping. The kidnapping itself was a success. If he hadn't been there, no blood would've been spilled.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... No blood would have been spilled?)
Kay:
You make it sound like it was his own fault for being there.
Edgeworth:
Kay, that's not it. When Agent Lang's trying to say is... ...simply, besides Mr. Cameron, there was no other casualties at the crime scene.
Kay:
Oh, was that all? Of course, that's obvious. The president was kidnapped, but... ...once the ransom money was paid, he was returned safe and sound.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... That sounds like an obvious point, however, something about it bothers me. I may need to re-evaluate the evidence once more.)
Lang:
You done explaining things to your assistant? I still have one last thing to confirm.
Present Mysterious Bloodstain
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"If the eyewitness, Cameron, had not been there, no murder would have taken place..."
Lang:
Afterwards, the body was moved to the flowerbeds and a fake photo was taken.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
That's also an important point. I'd like to take another good clean look at the information.
Lang:
Yeah, I'm with you there. Let's start with what Cameron saw before he was murdered. Cameron witnessed the president and the kidnapper in front of the orphanage.
Edgeworth:
However, the culprit wanted to conceal the connection between the incident and the orphanage.
Lang:
That's right. That's why Cameron's original roll of film was disposed of... ...and a fake photo was taken of them standing outside the grounds of the orphanage.
Edgeworth:
Yes. And Cameron's body was then moved to match the photo.
Lang:
Grrr...! It's finally becoming clear. The secret that was buried in the snow for 12 years...!
Kay:
Is this the truth of the SS-5 Incident?
Edgeworth:
........
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. What's the matter?
Edgeworth:
There is still something hidden behind this case...
Kay:
Huh!? What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
There is a piece of evidence that cannot be explained by Agent Lang's theory. As long as there's a contradiction, we'll have to present it in order to advance our reasoning...!
Edgeworth:
If the eyewitness, Cameron, had not been there, no murder would have taken place... Is that really the case?
Lang:
...The criminal's goal was only to kidnap the president. If there were no witness, there would've been no need to commit murder. Right?
Edgeworth:
And what if Cameron wasn't the only one who was murdered? There was a large bloodstain near the flowerbeds. However, Cameron was murdered... ...near the snowman. Ergo, this bloodstain could not have belonged to Cameron! Someone else's blood was spilled. And quite a vast amount at that...
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
......Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Do you have any idea what you're saying?
Edgeworth:
I do... It's hard to believe, however, that is what the evidence indicates... On that night, 12 years ago, there were two murders.
Lang:
Are you saying that the other murder was covered up!? Who... just who the heck could have been killed?
Edgeworth:
(A murder that was cleverly concealed. All traces of it were erased... And the incident itself was completely deleted from the case files. However, there's one thing... One piece of evidence that still remains intact after 12 years!) This piece of evidence shows that something happened that night!
Present Child's Drawing
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The other murder incident was buried in the dark by Blaise Debeste..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. This is the piece of evidence that shows what happened on that night!
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Is that really it? That piece of evidence doesn't tell me anything at all!
Edgeworth:
...Argh! (Looks like this wasn't it... There should be one more eyewitness who saw what happened on that night. I should show Agent Lang the evidence that proves that.)
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! Just who are you saying was killed on that night?
Leads back to:
"This piece of evidence shows that something happened that night!"
Edgeworth:
The other murder incident was buried in the dark by Blaise Debeste... However, there is still one piece of evidence that remains. Agent Lang... It survived by your father's hands.
Lang:
My old man... you say?
Edgeworth:
Please recall. There was one more thing that was hidden along with the traces of the murder. And that is, the existence of the boy who caused the fire...! Why did Blaise make the boy disappear? It's because he saw something that he wasn't supposed to see.
Kay:
What was the thing he wasn't supposed to see!?
Edgeworth:
Everything is drawn in this picture.
Lang:
The drawing my old man had!
Edgeworth:
The person drawn on the right is most likely the president. The Moozilla doll is also drawn near him. And the person standing opposite him is...
Present Sirhan Dogen profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"A man with a knife and a large, black dog. He is none other than... Sirhan Dogen."
Present anyone else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Isn't this the person standing opposite him?
Kay:
Is it really that person? They don't look very similar...
Edgeworth:
Given that it's a child's drawing, it can't be helped if they're not too similar.
Gumshoe:
Even if it's a child's drawing, I don't think that's it, sir...
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (To think even the detective rejected my theory!)
Gumshoe:
I think the person in the picture has some unique characteristics.
Kay:
That's right. It looks like he has a knife and a black dog with him.
Edgeworth:
(A knife and a black dog...? I think I have a hunch who that person is.)
Lang:
So in the end, who's the person in this drawing?
Edgeworth:
Sorry. There's no mistake that the person drawn on the right is the president.
Leads back to:
"And the person standing opposite him is..."
Edgeworth:
A man with a knife and a large, black dog. He is none other than... Sirhan Dogen.
Kay:
Whaaaaaaaaaat!? The assassin!?
Edgeworth:
Why would an assassin appear before a president? The answer is clear. Indeed, what occurred that night on the orphanage grounds 12 years ago was not a kidnapping. It was a presidential assassination!
Lang:
HOOOOOOOOOOOWL!
Kay:
Th-Then, Ms. Roland and Mr. Blaise were...
Edgeworth:
Yes. The two were likely partners in crime. One furnished the orphanage to use as the scene of the incident... ...and the other covered up the young boy's testimony. It's likely that Mr. Cameron was murdered because he witnessed the assassination itself. After all, the kidnapping never actually happened!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Stop messing around! You're saying that the president was assassinated 12 years ago? We just found his body today! He's been alive up until now!
Kay:
That's right! I mean, we met him ourselves!
Edgeworth:
If the president was assassinated 12 years ago, and the president's body was found today... ...that would imply there were two presidents.
Kay:
Yeah! And that can't be right!
Edgeworth:
Are you sure about that? There is the possibility that there were two presidents. (That's right... Up until now, I've been getting a strange feeling from the president...)
Lang:
Even so, I still respect the man. Zheng Fa is a small country. But he carried the nation with his strength.
Edgeworth:
(The image of President Huang that Agent Lang described...)
Huang:
You... you are wrong... I...
Edgeworth:
(...He revealed his true form.)
Edgeworth:
(...differs far too greatly from the President Huang we know! It's as if they were two entirely different people! If there were, in fact, two Zheng Fa presidents... ...exactly how would such a scenario be possible?) What would make the existence of the two presidents possible?
The president had a twin brother
Edgeworth:
Perhaps President Huang had a twin brother?
Gumshoe:
If that's the case, it certainly wouldn't be strange if there were two presidents, sir!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Unfortunately for you... The president was an only child!
Edgeworth:
What!? (Is that so...?)
Lang:
As I thought, it's impossible for there to be two presidents, isn't it?
Edgeworth:
No. There was a possibility that there were two presidents.
Leads back to:
"What would make the existence of the two presidents possible?"
One of them was a body double
Leads to:
"If we were to assume that one of them was a body double, wouldn't it be possible then?"
The victim looked like the president
Edgeworth:
The person killed 12 years ago just happened to look like the president... If we think of it like that, wouldn't it all make sense?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Take a good look at the boy's drawing that you brought out! No matter how you look at it, this guy is President Huang!
Edgeworth:
Argh! (It's just as Agent Lang says...)
Lang:
As I thought, it's impossible for there to be two presidents, isn't it?
Edgeworth:
No. There was a possibility that there were two presidents.
Leads back to:
"What would make the existence of the two presidents possible?"
Edgeworth:
If we were to assume that one of them was a body double, wouldn't it be possible then?
Lang:
A body double...!
Edgeworth:
President Huang possessed immense power and authority in Zheng Fa. I'm sure there were those who envied his position and made attempts on his life. Yes. Just as he was attacked a few days ago at Gourd Lake.
Lang:
It's true, there were those who sought Huang's life from time to time. But, I can't easily believe there were two presidents. At least, not without any evidence!
Edgeworth:
(Do I have evidence that proves there were two presidents?)
Present SS-5 Incident Files
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"(Has Agent Lang not noticed this contradiction?)"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
If you look at this evidence, you'll see that there were two presidents.
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Unfortunately, I have no idea what you're talking about! Lang Zi says: "Evidence doesn't speak!" Evidence with no meaning won't tell us anything!
Edgeworth:
Argh! (Looks like this wasn't it.)
Kay:
If only we knew that the president was in two different places at the same time... ...then we could prove that there were two people.
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Let's look at the evidence and reorganize the incident again.
Lang:
How could there have been two Mr. Huangs? As I suspected, it's impossible! If you want to say there were two people, show me the proof!
Leads back to:
"(Do I have evidence that proves there were two presidents?)"
Edgeworth:
(Has Agent Lang not noticed this contradiction? Or... has he noticed it, but can't admit it?)
Lang:
What is it, Mr. Prosecutor? Don't shout something out only to suddenly clam up.
Edgeworth:
According to the recording on the doll, the president visited the orphanage at midnight. However... that should not have been possible.
Kay:
Huh!? Why's that?
Edgeworth:
Why? Because at the time, the president should have been at the embassy. He was together with Agent Lang's father...
Lang:
............
Edgeworth:
(So, Agent Lang, you really did notice.) He was in two places at the same time. Ergo, there must have been two presidents.
Lang:
HOOOOOOOOOOWL!
Courtney:
Then, which of the two was the real president on that day 12 years ago!?
Edgeworth:
Most likely the one who died.
Lang:
Who!? Who contracted Dogen to murder Huang?
Edgeworth:
(In order to learn that, first... ...we must have a look at the evidence that we proved was false earlier. And the piece of evidence... we know to be false is...!)
Present Cameron's Photo
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The photo taken with Cameron's camera was taken after he was murdered."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. Take a look at this.
Lang:
What about it!?
Edgeworth:
This is the evidence that shows who planned the assassination plot against President Huang!
Lang:
........
Edgeworth:
...Agent Lang. I know it's hard to believe, but this is the truth.
Lang:
No. Mr. Prosecutor. I was just speechless because your reasoning was so crazy.
Edgeworth:
Argh! (He sure doesn't hold back... The person who killed the real president and took his place... That person is without a doubt the one behind this incident. I must show Agent Lang the evidence that proves who that person was!)
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. You already realized who's behind the plot, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. I will show you that evidence right now.
Leads back to:
"(And the piece of evidence... we know to be false is...!)"
Edgeworth:
The photo taken with Cameron's camera was taken after he was murdered. And he was murdered because he witnessed the presidential assassination... In other words, the photo must have been taken following the assassination. Given that, who is the president pictured in the fake photo? ...We must consider him to be the body double.
Lang:
In other words, the body double had the real president murdered and then took his place!
Edgeworth:
Patricia Roland and Blaise must have cooperated in that plan.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hold it! Huang's body was never found! Just where could it have disappeared to!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The answer to that is already quite apparent...! This is where the real president's body was!
Present Monster's Footprints
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Last night, there was something Blaise had to unearth with his own two hands."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Can you put the jokes aside? I can't believe that Mr. Huang's body was in that kind of place!
Edgeworth:
Gah! (I guess it wasn't there... This is the place that the real president was killed. Furthermore, what was the person responsible doing here? If I think about that, I'm sure to know the location of the president's body!)
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Where did the president's body disappear to? Maybe you really don't have an answer for that?
Edgeworth:
No, Agent Lang. The answer to that is already quite apparent...
Leads back to:
"This is where the real president's body was!"
Edgeworth:
Last night, there was something Blaise had to unearth with his own two hands. That item was not the ransom... It was something far more important.
Kay:
Ah! So Blaise unburied the...!
Edgeworth:
...the real president's body! The possibility is quite high.
Lang:
What'd you saaaayy!?
Edgeworth:
The bones from the body buried 12 years ago would have still remained. According to Mr. Powers, construction was to begin soon at this lot. That was the deadline... ...both for the movie and retrieval of the body.
Kay:
Because they would've found the body when they started the construction!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang! Let us search the footprints that Blaise dug up!
Lang:
...Yeah. If the body was buried there, there'd be traces of it. Hey! Somebody call forensics!
Forensics:
I have the results of the search! We've found traces in the dirt that suggest a body was buried here!
Lang:
Tch... So, it was Huang after all?
Forensics:
We also recovered the skeletal remains that Blaise Debeste dug up. They were in his home. In addition to the bone structure, the dental records and the bone fractures all match up. We can confirm that it was indeed President Huang!
Edgeworth:
So the real President Huang was indeed killed 12 years ago. The SS-5 Incident was a murder.
Monster's Footprints data updated in my Organizer.
Kay:
So the SS-5 Incident was actually a murder incident! But there's so much information, it's way too confusing...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Let us take this opportunity to review the details of the case.
Kay:
First, the real president came to the orphanage, right?
Edgeworth:
Twelve years ago... ...the true President Huang visited the orphanage in order to meet his son. The footsteps in the snow that we thought belonged to Mr. Cameron... ...were most likely made by the president at that time. President Huang was supposed to meet his son here... However, the one who actually showed up was the assassin, Sirhan Dogen.
Kay:
He came here to meet his son, but was murdered instead... How horrible...
Edgeworth:
A man like Dogen... shows no mercy. ...And after that, the second tragedy occurred.
Kay:
You mean Mr. Cameron's murder?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Mr. Cameron saw the decisive moment. After the real president was killed by Dogen... ...his body was carried to the rear courtyard by the team of kidnappers. Mr. Cameron must have witnessed that moment... ...from the orphanage entrance. Although, he himself believed that he had actually witnessed a kidnapping. Furthermore, by this time...
Kay:
...the body double, who had come to meet up with Blaise and Ms. Roland... ...was already standing behind Mr. Cameron.
Edgeworth:
And then the witness to the incident, Mr. Cameron...
Kay:
...was killed by the body double. So, was Mr. Cameron's corpse also carried by the body double?
Edgeworth:
Yes, that seems likely.
Kay:
But, there wasn't anything at the crime scene that looked like the body double's footprints!
Edgeworth:
Heh. I've already figured out how he accomplished that. There is a piece of evidence that would've made it possible. What did the body double use to move the body without leaving any footprints?
Present Victim's Shoes
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is almost certainly how the body double carried Mr. Cameron's corpse."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
The double likely used this to move Mr. Cameron's body.
Kay:
Whoa! He used that to move the body? How would that actually work?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... he... er... used trick after trick and put in a lot of effort...
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Let's be honest and recognize our mistakes, OK?
Edgeworth:
Argh! (It appears this wasn't it... The body double's footprints should have been left at the scene, but they aren't... On the other hand, the victim's footprints are clearly there... I already have the evidence to tie these two facts together!)
Leads back to:
"What did the body double use to move the body without leaving any footprints?"
Edgeworth:
This is almost certainly how the body double carried Mr. Cameron's corpse. After Mr. Cameron was killed... ...the president's body double carried him into the middle of the garden. I suspect the body double was wearing the same shoes as the real president at the time. If he made sure to step precisely on top of the footprints left by the real president...
Kay:
Ah! Since the shoes were the same... ...there would only be one set of footprints left behind in the snow. I think I've got a pretty good grasp on the SS-5 Incident now. But, there's still one thing I don't get.
Edgeworth:
What's that?
Kay:
Why did they need to stage the abduction?
Edgeworth:
Because Mr. Cameron witnessed the incident. He saw the president at the orphanage. He left behind witness testimony on Ms. Crane's answering machine. Even Blaise couldn't make that disappear. Ergo, the body double needed a reason for the president to have been at the orphanage.
Kay:
And that's why they prepared the fake kidnapping charade.
Edgeworth:
The people in the fake photo are the body double, and most likely, Patricia Roland.
Kay:
The person in the coat is Ms. Roland? What makes you say that?
Edgeworth:
The two would have to leave the orphanage in order to take the picture. Just like when he moved the body, the double used the real president's footprints.
Kay:
Ah! So the second set of footprints must belong to the person in the coat!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. We originally believed that those footprints belonged to Cameron's killer. They were size 7 footprints, too small for Blaise's feet. Thus, we can presume that the person playing the part of the kidnapper was Patricia Roland. Hidden in the shadow of the presidential kidnapping was a presidential assassination...
Lang:
I see... So that's why my old man...
Edgeworth:
Why he... what?
Lang:
The old man must have realized that a murder had taken place. ...After all, he had the kid's drawing.
Courtney:
However, that picture was never presented as evidence...
Edgeworth:
Your father likely took it from the young witness during the investigation and hid it.
Lang:
He had to have known that Huang was dead. But what if he had revealed that back then?
Edgeworth:
Reveal the death of the president, the backbone of Zheng Fa? It would have caused chaos...
Lang:
...and that's why my old man took the secret to his grave. He even took the blame for the kidnapping, knowing that would be the fall of the House of Lang!
Edgeworth:
So this is the truth that Agent Lang's father hid 12 years ago...
Kay:
And now, it's all become clear.
SS-5 Incident Case Files updated in my Organizer.
???:
...Is that really the case, I wonder?
Kay:
Huh!?
Edgeworth:
What!?
Lang:
Who's there!?
Edgeworth:
(That bell... it's...!) ...Sirhan Dogen!
Lang:
You! Why are you here!?
Gumshoe:
How can you just brazenly show up here!? Who do you think you are, pal!?
Dogen:
I found the conversation most intriguing, and I just... well...
Edgeworth:
Heh. Are you feeling nostalgic about an old murder of yours?
Lang:
You're the one who killed Huang...!
Dogen:
Keh heh heh heh. Nostalgia? I think not. You were speaking about the person I am searching for.
Edgeworth:
You're searching for someone?
Dogen:
I escaped from prison in order to meet with a young acolyte... The one who wore the red raincoat...
Edgeworth:
The red raincoat!?
Kay:
Wh-Who is this person?
Dogen:
I suspect that it's the same person as the mastermind you are searching for.
Edgeworth:
!
???:
Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood...
Edgeworth:
(The red hood?)
Dogen:
Don't they seem surprised, Anubis? Yes, yes they are, my boy. Twelve years ago, this young acolyte saved my life...
-- Dogen's Savior --
Dogen:
Certainly, it was I who killed President Huang.
However, my life was also targeted on that day.
The body double, Blaise, and Patricia all sought to seal my lips.
Had I not been reunited with the young acolyte back then, I would have been in danger.
But alas, even to this day, I do not know what has become of the young acolyte...
Edgeworth:
So your client was indeed the body double, who was the main perpetrator of the crime.
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. It was a long time ago, but I remember his words even now.
There have been countless attempts on my life. Not just once or twice. Countless! And yet, why must I be the only one to face the danger? When I stand before the people, I garner the same respect as the president does. Tell me, just what is the difference between him and me!?
Dogen:
The difference was great. While the voice and style of speech may be the same... Keh heh heh. One can mimic the body, but the heart cannot be reproduced.
Edgeworth:
(I suppose his own weaknesses cost him in his quest to become a leader.)
Knightley:
Now that Rooke's gone, I'm in charge!
de Killer:
I'm not sure if you're as capable as Rooke was...
Knightley:
Wh-What are you saying!? I'm totally the leader now!
Edgeworth:
(Hmph... perhaps the king and his knight were not so different after all.)
Dogen:
The double believed that the president's only weakness was a woman called Amy. To find the woman, he needed the assistance of someone from this country.
Edgeworth:
So, he joined forced with Blaise...
Dogen:
After determining her whereabouts, he simply waited for the right opportunity.
Kay:
That chance came with the meeting at the orphanage.
Dogen:
Indeed. The director of the orphanage was bribed and brought in as an accomplice.
Edgeworth:
(He must be referring to Patricia Roland.)
Dogen:
Well. Given what I've told you, do you realize the whereabouts of the young acolyte now?
Edgeworth:
You mean the boy who saved you. But, how do you know that he is the mastermind?
Dogen:
...That day, the young one caused a fire at the garden of the orphanage.
Kay:
Ah! You're talking about the kid who started the fire as a prank!
Dogen:
A prank...? Keh heh heh, not at all. On that night 12 years ago, the young acolyte was hiding inside the igloo... It seems he witnessed Patricia Roland and Blaise moving the body from his hiding place. Apparently, he heard them talking during that time. It would seem that they were planning to kill me because I knew the truth. He immediately came to the main hall to tell me that. I learned this about the young acolyte some time later... It seems he was wearing a red raincoat at the time. He led me out of the main hall. And then, the young acolyte... ...said he was going to get rid of our footprints. So he scattered some lamp oil near the igloo over the snow. Then he boldly set the oil ablaze!
Kay:
Ah! No way! So he set the fire in order to...!
Dogen:
All their focus was diverted towards the burning flames. I took the opportunity to escape through the rear exit.
Edgeworth:
So, the boy in the red raincoat is the mastermind behind this case?
Dogen:
Exactly. Isn't that right, Anubis? Yes, boy. Yes it is.
Rebuttal
-- Dogen's Savior --
Dogen:
Certainly, it was I who killed President Huang.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You admitted that rather easily.
Dogen:
These days, I have long grown tired of killing. ...Keh heh heh. But in those halcyon days, I devoted myself to the path of an executioner. If one cannot admit that much, what can he admit? Right, Anubis? Yes, yes, my boy.
Kay:
I feel like he's saying something scary, but it's kind of hard to understand him!
Edgeworth:
This fallen priest is saying he has no feelings about the president's death. (Dogen, the assassin and escaped prisoner. He should be a despicable opponent, but... ...silencing him now would be imprudent. I must keep my composure and let him talk!) I understand your point. ...You killed the president.
Dogen:
That is correct. The aim of my blade never misses its mark.
Dogen:
However, my life was also targeted on that day.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Your life was targeted? You, the assassin?
Kay:
The hunter becomes the hunted. The Buddhist becomes the Buddha.
Edgeworth:
Kay, you don't have to make up strange proverbs.
Dogen:
...Life is transient. Especially for an assassin, whose life is always exposed to danger.
Kay:
So, does that mean people you've tried to kill have fought back?
Dogen:
That is a rare occurrence... However, this was different.
Dogen:
The body double, Blaise, and Patricia all sought to seal my lips.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Sirhan Dogen. You are a master assassin. As such, could you not have evaded an attack from those three and fled the scene...?
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. You greatly overestimate me. Without Anubis by my side, I would not even be able to walk about. If those three were to attack me all at once, I would not stand a chance.
Edgeworth:
I see. So even an assassin will fall to superior numbers in a frontal assault.
Dogen:
I suppose one could say that. I, Sirhan Dogen, would have suffered a shameful defeat.
Dogen:
Had I not been reunited with the young acolyte back then, I would have been in danger.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Reunited...? So, when did you first meet with him?
Dogen:
That would be 18 years ago, on the 24th of December.
Edgeworth:
(That is a rather long time ago...)
Dogen:
On that day, our roles were reversed. I saved the young one's life. There was an unusual snowstorm on that day. The temperature was well below freezing. I took Anubis for a walk in the snow. That's when Anubis noticed something and started running. I followed after him and found a car. I had great difficulty opening the door. It had frozen shut. In the back seat... there were two young children, shivering from the cold.
Edgeworth:
Two children?
Dogen:
Had they remained in the car for an hour longer, they surely would have frozen to death. I brought the two of them to a nearby orphanage...
Edgeworth:
(Is there anything about Dogen's story that concerns me?)
There is something
Leads to:
"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?"
Leave him be
Edgeworth:
(I don't think there's anything in particular that stands out...) Dogen, please continue your testimony.
Edgeworth:
(What concerns me is...)
The date
Leads to:
"The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that?"
The number of children
Edgeworth:
There were two children in the car... you're sure of that?
Dogen:
It may have been 18 years ago, but I remember it clearly. There were two children in the car, there is no mistaking it. Does the good prosecutor have a problem with that number?
Edgeworth:
(Right now, the number of children isn't what I have a problem with.)
Dogen:
Are we done talking about this subject yet?
Leads back to:
"(What concerns me is...)"
The model of the car
Edgeworth:
What was the model of the car the children were in?
Dogen:
The model of the car? What would you want to know that for? It was a typical mid-size car, the kind you see everywhere. Other than the freezing children sitting inside, there was nothing unusual about it.
Edgeworth:
(...Looks like the car model is of no real importance.)
Dogen:
Are we done talking about this subject yet?
Leads back to:
"(What concerns me is...)"
Edgeworth:
The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that?
Dogen:
There is no mistake.
Ray:
C-Could that mean...!?
Edgeworth:
(I know... the significance behind that date.) What shows the significance of the date when Dogen found the children?
Present IS-7 Incident Documents
Edgeworth:
Take that!

This piece of evidence is connected to that date, isn't it?
Kay:
Ummm... How exactly is it connected?
Dogen:
I don't know what the good prosecutor brought out... ...but I can sense that there is no real connection behind it.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (Dogen saw through it.)
Kay:
Mr. Dogen found the children on December 24th! Let's try looking at the evidence again with that date in mind!
Leads back to:
"(I know... the significance behind that date.)"
Dogen:
But alas, even to this day, I do not know what has become of the young acolyte...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
And now you're searching for the boy from all those years ago? Surely, you're not saying you want to thank him for saving you?
Dogen:
Keh heh heh... Well, who knows. However, the young one did save my life. That is the truth. Even Anubis took a liking to him. He would do tricks for him, such as "shake" or "roll over".
Kay:
I thought that the tricks Dogen taught his dog were a little bit different from the norm, though.
Dogen:
You are right about that. For Anubis, "roll over" means first biting the victim's foot...
Kay:
Stop! Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear any more!
Dogen:
Keh heh heh... There is no need to worry, I only showed the young one ordinary tricks.
Edgeworth:
(...Hmm. I get the feeling that Dogen, in his own way, felt indebted to the boy.)
Kay:
Mr. Dogen and that "acolyte" seem to share a complicated relationship, huh.
Edgeworth:
Perhaps there is a hint to the mastermind's motive hidden somewhere in his testimony. Dogen is one of the few people who knows the mastermind first hand... Let's try to draw out as much information as possible from him.
Edgeworth:
That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered.
Kay:
Ah!
Edgeworth:
During that incident, two young boys went missing. The sons of the victim, Isaac Dover, and the culprit, Dane Gustavia...
Ray:
We never did find out where those two boys went after the case 18 years ago...
Dogen:
Oh? They were the sons of a victim and a culprit? It all makes sense now.
Edgeworth:
What makes sense?
Dogen:
One of the youths was bound, so that he could not move.
Kay:
Mr. Dover did it so that Mr. Gustavia's son couldn't come to the contest venue.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Gustavia was using his own son as a taste tester.
Dogen:
Keh heh heh heh. To think that was what transpired. Neither child seemed to recall what had happened.
Edgeworth:
They lost their memories?
Dogen:
The acolyte told me this when we were reunited 12 years ago. The pair were placed in an extreme situation, on the verge of freezing to death... That trauma led them both to suffer from amnesia. Neither could so much as remember his own name.
Kay:
So they didn't even know that they were the sons of Mr. Dover and Mr. Gustavia.
Edgeworth:
Indeed, while we cannot say it conclusively, the probability is quite high. (However, we still don't have enough information to deduce the mastermind's identity...) Dogen... Would you please continue your story?
Dogen:
Keh heh. Very well.
-- Dogen and the "Acolyte" --
Dogen:
I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison.
Recently, that has all come to an abrupt halt, however. It left me quite concerned.
Furthermore, those involved in the crime 12 years ago were all drawn into incidents one by one.
I grew more and more curious. And so I absconded briefly from the prison.
Edgeworth:
Those involved 12 years ago... ...were Patricia Roland, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang's body double.
Kay:
And Ms. Roland was the warden of Mr. Dogen's prison.
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. I blackmailed the warden. That woman had tried to kill me. Perhaps the good prosecutor has already deduced the reason?
Edgeworth:
You murdered President Huang... However, the world still believed he was alive. If you were able to prove the president was a fake... ...both Patricia Roland and Blaise Debeste would have been in danger.
Dogen:
That is correct. And I had heard the proof with my own ears.
I'll be waiting in the courtyard of the orphanage at midnight on February 9th. Even if it's just once, I want John to be able to meet you. I'm sorry if I'm being selfish, but... I'll be waiting.
Huang:
...Who might you be? My apologies, but I am presently waiting for someone...
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. I am well aware of that... President Huang. Are you not meeting with your son? However, I do not spill blood needlessly. You may relax. I seek only the president's life.
Huang:
.........It can't be. P-Please wait. I am just about to meet my son for the first time. I'm sure this will be the first and the last time. Please, at least wait until we are finished...
Dogen:
I had thought the president would beg for his life, but he was of a different sort. Officially, the president had no son. However, he shook his head and said... ...this illegitimate son was his, and he intended to recognize him publicly. Furthermore, he claimed that he had already made preparations towards that end... Would that son of his be the boy with horns over there by any chance?
Kay:
Boy... with the horns? Wait, you can see John's horns?
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. There is no need to see them. From the moment I escaped from prison until now... ...I have been closely lending an ear to your voices.
Edgeworth:
(He said that the president made "preparations" towards recognizing his son... ...but the word "preparations" alone would be insufficient for blackmail.) ........That's it!
Lang:
There was one thing that could prove Huang's words: the will held by the House of Lang. It was also proof of his trust in us. His son's existence would've been revealed to the world.
Dogen:
The name on the recording, the mention of preparations, and the will in Zheng Fa... Keh heh heh. Together, they sufficed to make the Warden bow to my words.
Edgeworth:
(With those three pieces of information, one could prove the identity of the double... ...by using John!)
John:
..........
Dogen:
The president blocked the first strike of my knife with something soft. As pieces of it fell atop the snow, I struck once more. This time, the blow proved fatal.
Edgeworth:
(So Dogen cut off the Moozilla doll's horn...)
Dogen:
None but I heard his final words. Only myself and that child knew of the president's secret son.

Edgeworth:
In other words, you contacted him from prison?
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. That is correct. A post-office box was used.
Kay:
A post-office box...?
Edgeworth:
It would allow one to send and receive letters without revealing the recipient's location.
Dogen:
I could not use a form of correspondence that would reveal the acolyte's location. ...There was someone keeping watch over my correspondences, after all.
Edgeworth:
(He must mean the prison warden... Patricia Roland.) Could you be more specific about the nature of your correspondences?
Dogen:
Well. They were mainly moves from my correspondence chess matches.
Kay:
C-Correspondence chess? If I recall, the person you were playing against...
Edgeworth:
This might be hard to believe... but Dogen's chess opponent was...
Kay:
Ah! Are you saying he was playing against Mr. Knightley? Wasn't it Horace Knightley?
Edgeworth:
We certainly found the correspondence chess memo in Knightley's cell.
Correspondence Chess Memo jotted down in my Organizer.

Mr. Shields. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence.
Ray:
What about it? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think it has anything to do with the incident at all, though.
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (Perhaps I should think it over one more time?)
Ray:
Why don't you look over Knightley-boy's belongings one more time? Something related to the IS-7 Incident just might pop out!
Edgeworth:
(Knightley's belongings, huh? Let's look over them one more time...)
Edgeworth:
(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within? Which should I investigate? The ring or the chessboard...?)
The ring
Leads to:
"This ring is...!"
The chessboard
Edgeworth:
(Obviously, we should investigate the chessboard.)
Ray:
Huh? Miles, what are you doing taking out the chessboard? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think the chessboard has anything to do with the IS-7 Incident.
Edgeworth:
Argh! (He may be right... In that case, the only piece of evidence left to investigate is...)
Leads to:
"This ring is...!"
Edgeworth:
This ring is...!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, what is it?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields, please take a look at this ring!
Ray:
Th-This pattern is... It's Pierre Hoquet's!
Edgeworth:
I thought so... He had Mr. Dover's seal turned into a ring. However, why would he have this? Shouldn't it have been held by the police as evidence from the IS-7 Incident?
Ray:
After the incident, the seal was returned to the victim's next-of-kin. And Mr. Dover's only family was his son. But since no one knew where the son had gone to, it took a while to get it to him. I'd heard that the police had finally found him and delivered his inheritance, but...
Edgeworth:
...So the seal was thereby safely delivered to his son. And then, he turned the seal into a ring and wore it on his person.
Knightley's Mementos data updated in my Organizer.
Kay:
So... Mr. Knightley was Mr. Dover's son...
Ray:
The police aren't fools. I'm sure they did a thorough check before handing over the seal.
Kay:
If someone involved in the IS-7 Incident was his chess opponent...
Lang:
Knightley, huh. Then that man must be the mastermind behind this case!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But, Knightley is dead! He cannot be involved in this incident.
Ray:
How about that. The only one who could be the mastermind was himself a murder victim...?
Kay:
But a dead guy can't be the culprit! So there's no way that's right!
Edgeworth:
(It certainly is strange... In that case, who is the culprit?)

Kay:
His chess opponent was Horace Knightley, right?
Edgeworth:
The ring Knightley wore... Mr. Shields, please have a close look at it.
Ray:
Yeah, there's no mistake. This is the evidence from the IS-7 Incident. The police found Mr. Dover's son and returned it to him. If you're saying that the son was Knightley, then... ...the acolyte, who was Dogen's chess opponent and the mastermind, was Knightley?
Edgeworth:
No, Knightley has already been murdered. He cannot be at the center of the incident. There is no doubt that the mastermind is still hiding somewhere out there.
Kay:
...Well then, Mr. Dogen. Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Dogen:
Hmm... that was a rather interesting tale. Wasn't it, Anubis? I shall continue my story about the acolyte. Our longstanding chess match continued...
Edgeworth:

Dogen:
Good boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt.
Dogen:
Recently, that has all come to an abrupt halt, however. It left me quite concerned.

Edgeworth:
It came to a halt? Now, of all times?
Dogen:
Quite odd, is it not? Anubis told me again and again how odd it was.
Kay:
That scary dog talked? Was he like, "Something's odd, woof!"?
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. I can understand Anubis's heart, even if he does not voice his thoughts.
Kay:
Umm... Then, there's something I'd like to ask, just in case. Your scary dog's staring at me right now... He's not saying, "I'm hungry. I want some meat", right?
Dogen:
Keh heh heh... Perhaps.

That certainly does seem too much for a mere coincidence. The body double of Di-Jun Huang, the president of Zheng Fa faked an assassination plot. Patricia Roland, the prison warden, murdered Horace Knightley. And Blaise Debeste, the Chairman of the P.I.C, murdered Jill Crane. (Come to think of it, as I have been investigating these cases... ...I have felt the presence of some force behind the scenes.)

Gumshoe:
B-But even so, you can't just escape from prison, pal! Arrest him! Arrest him!
Dogen:
That won't be necessary. Once my business is done, I shall return to my cell.

Dogen:
Keh heh heh. The Wolf may say that... ...but one can see that the Wolf and his pack also share an interest in the tales of my past.
Lang:
Tch...!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, Detective Gumshoe. There are still a few things I must ask Dogen. Please postpone matters until then.
Gumshoe:

Kay:
OK, OK... Umm... But even so, I don't really get it. Who exactly is this "acolyte"?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Dogen himself has not yet made that clear. (What's important is the thread connecting Dogen and this "acolyte": their correspondence. And not just the letters. We should pay attention to the means that was used as well.)
Edgeworth:
I'm certain you said... You wrote your letters in braille.
Dogen:
Correct. The good prosecutor must know that I am lacking in sight, do you not?
Edgeworth:
The correspondence chess letter we found had been typed out using a word processor.
Dogen:
What? That... cannot be.
Edgeworth:
What do you mean...?
Kay:
So, someone went of their way to retype the letters on a computer?
Edgeworth:
Could another person have acted as a middleman between Dogen and Knightley?
Kay:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
Dogen wrote his letters in braille. However... ...by the time it reached Knightley, it had been rewritten on a word processor. ...We must assume that some middleman rewrote those letters.
Ray:
And the reverse can also be said. That same somebody might've taken the letters Knightley wrote and redelivered them to Dogen.
Edgeworth:
Yes, that is indeed true.
Correspondence Chess Memo updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Knightley and Dogen both communicated through a certain individual... Dogen, were the letters that reached you...
Dogen:
They were in braille, of course.
Ray:
So Knightley-boy's letters must have been transposed by that same person as well.
Dogen:
Oh...? Then that somebody must be...
Edgeworth:
...the mastermind behind the case.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
You're saying there's someone else who's the mastermind behind this case!? Then who the hell is it!?
Edgeworth:
Dover's son, Knightley, is already deceased. In that case, there is one more youth that we should consider to be the mastermind.
Lang:
You mean, Dane Gustavia's son...? But, who the heck is he?
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
...Would this decisive evidence of yours be something you recorded on that tape recorder?
Nicole:
That's Mr. Edgeworth for ya! Yer good at figurin' things out, aren't ya!? It's the sound of Moozilla spewin' out fire. This place nearly became a sea of flames!
Nicole:
That's right. I ain't actually seen it with my own eyes, though...
Edgeworth:
Could you let us listen to the tape?
Nicole:
Sure thing. ...There we go!
Edgeworth:
(This sound, it's as I thought...! So, it seems that my reasoning was correct. The true nature of the monster and the mastermind... all of my logic is coming together!) Ms. Hart! You said that you captured a giant eye on film, did you not?
Lotta:
Sure did, right here in this photo.
Edgeworth:
(Though we cannot confirm it like this...) Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
Lend us your film analysis device!
Gumshoe:
OK, but... What do you want to analyze, sir?
Edgeworth:
This photo, please!
Gumshoe:
I'm on it!
Edgeworth:
(Is there a new clue in this photo?)
Present giant eyeball (after zooming)
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"Th-This is...!"
Present Jill Crane
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Kay:
I can't really tell since the person is wearing a raincoat... ...but, this should be Ms. Crane before she died, right?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. She was Mr. Cameron's love interest. He was murdered 12 years ago.
Kay:
And she was murdered while investigating the mysteries of that past case... I'm sure she must've been very sad and frustrated by all that happened... We're... gonna finish what Ms. Crane set out to do! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. That was my intention all along. Just leave it to me.
Leads back to:
"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)"
Present ladder
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Kay:
Ah! It's a ladder! We climbed up this ladder earlier, right!?
Edgeworth:
Yes, we did. (...Countless times since yesterday.)
Kay:
Take a look at this ladder... It's not bad, per se, but you can see how the gap between the steps is a little too wide. And these handrails would be way easier to grasp if they were just a bit more rounded. And also, the steps don't fell quite right when you're climbing on them for some reason. Hmm. I don't want to be too critical, so I'll give it around... 198 points!
Edgeworth:
(...Out of what?)
Leads back to:
"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
There's nothing unusual about this area.
Leads back to:
"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)"
Gumshoe:
Th-This is...!
Lotta:
See!? Ain't the Moozilla's eye right where I said it would be!?
Edgeworth:
Heh... I see. I have finally grasped... ...the true form of the giant monster that was being controlled by the mastermind!
Lotta:
.......G
Nicole:
.....G-G
Gumshoe:
...G-G-G
Kay:
Giant Monster!?
Hold it!
Lotta:
A-Are ya admittin' it? You are, ain't ya!? Yer admittin' that the Mighty Moozilla is real!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
No... This is not Moozilla. This is the eye of a different monster. Please have a look at this.
Kay:
It's a flyer for the Berry Big Circus...? Aah! Th-This is...!
Edgeworth:
Precisely. There is a rather large balloon with the head of a lion pictured here. This balloon is the true identity of the Giant Monster! In addition, the sound Ms. Swift recorded, which she believes to be Moozilla spewing flames...
Hold it!
Nicole:
Mr. Prosecutor... don't tell me, yer gonna say somethin' that'll shatter my dreams of a scoop...
Gumshoe:
Hot air balloons fly by using burners to hear the air, right, sir?
Edgeworth:
Precisely, Detective. The mastermind used this monster of his... ...to bring Kay to the rooftop of the Grand Tower without using the elevator!
Kay:
Wouldn't that mean... that the mastermind is someone connected to the circus?
Ray:
He's a member of the circus, Knightley's friend, and... Dane Gustavia's son. Wh... Who'd have thunk it...!?
Edgeworth:
An apprentice beast tamer? Heh..... He's no amateur. For the beast he has tamed is none other than this entire case! Simon Keyes! He is the mastermind behind this whole incident!
Kay:
M-Mr. Keyes... was really behind it all...? N-No way...! I don't believe it! I mean, we trusted him! How could it all have been a lie!? That's just... heartbreaking...
Edgeworth:
Kay.....
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Hm...? What is it?
John:
Hey, you! Stop! Where do you think you're going!?
Dogen:
Keh heh heh heh... The boy with horns is rather perceptive. ...The good prosecutor has done a remarkable job. Now that I have heard that, I have no further business here.
Edgeworth:
What... Wait! Dogen!
Grrr... *ruff, ruff!*
Lang:
Dammit! Where'd he vanish to!?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Are you OK!?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I'm fine. However...
John:
.....That guy...!
Edgeworth:
...John?
John:
That Dogen guy... he's the one who killed my dad, right?
Edgeworth:
(There is no question more difficult to answer. However...) There's no use in denying the truth. Yes, John... You are correct.
John:
He'll pay for this... I swear he's gonna pay...! I... I'll make him pay myse...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
John! You mustn't finish that thought! ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please pay us no mind.
Edgeworth:
......
Gumshoe:
Sir! I've put out an APB on Dogen! All available police units will be searching for him!
Lang:
...You heard the man, kid. I don't mean to be heartless, but we need to hurry, too. So Mr. Prosecutor, where's the mastermind right now?
Edgeworth:
...Agent Lang is right. Our top priority right now should be catching the mastermind. He said he would be practicing. He is most likely at the Berry Big Circus tent. But first... Agent Lang, I have a request.
Lang:
A request...? What is it?
Edgeworth:
Now that we've identified the Giant Monster, our next order of business... is to capture it. The moment we arrive at the tent, I need you to locate that specific item posthaste. And Detective, I ask that you perform a follow-up investigation on the kidnapping incident.
Gumshoe:
Roger that, sir!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. I wanna help out too!
Edgeworth:
Hmm. In that case, you'll be in charge of calling for backup. If he is truly the mastermind, we may require assistance from a certain someone... (I met him so many times, yet his facade always fooled me into sympathy. He may have got the better of me in the past... but this time, I'll settle it once and for all!)
To be continued.
April 6, 5:30 PMBerry Big CircusStorage Tent
Regina:
Ah! Mr. Edgeworth!
Simon:
Are you guys here for the show?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes... Ms. Berry...
Simon:
You're a little early... I'm sorry, but we're still getting ready... But, I'm so happy you came! You remembered our promise!
Edgeworth:
Yes, I remembered... You asked us to come and see the show when you gave me this.
Simon:
...I'm so happy you came! Please enjoy yourselves! I'm sure my performance will surprise you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Your "performance" has already surprised me, Mr. Keyes.
Simon:
..........
Regina:
Umm. But he hasn't performed yet...
Edgeworth:
Regina. Please have a look at this photo. Is this balloon the property of the Berry Big Circus?
Regina:
Ah! I-It is! Did you see it flying around somewhere?
Edgeworth:
It's highly likely that this balloon was used by the culprit in the case we are investigating.
Regina:
Huh!?
Edgeworth:
Who is in charge of the balloon?
Regina:
Well, th-that would be S-Simon, but... A-Are you saying...!?
Simon:
.........
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes. You flew this balloon in the middle of the night. Did you not?
Simon:
...I do occasionally practice alone at night. I'm not much of a pilot though. I'm... a little clumsy.
Edgeworth:
Heh. So for practice, you'll do something as challenging as flying a balloon at night? Wouldn't that be rather difficult for someone who is clumsy and "not much of a pilot"?
Simon:
Then... what do you think I was doing, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
You brought Kay to the roof of the Grand Tower... ...in order to frame her for the murder of Jill Crane! Not a single security camera recorded Kay using the elevator. Therefore, the only way she could have gotten up there was through flight. And the only one who could have flown her up there... was you, Mr. Keyes.
Simon:
No way... Mr. Edgeworth, how can you say that?
Edgeworth:
That's not all. You drugged John at the garbage pickup, and kidnapped him. Wasn't that why you were late when you came to watch the trial of Patricia Roland?
Simon:
No way... I have no idea what you're saying. There's no way I could do things like that. Please believe me... Mr. Edgeworth, please!
Edgeworth:
I wanted to believe you. However... you have broken that trust yourself!
Simon:
Th... That's horrible. Why would you say that? Didn't you once say that you would trust me? That you'd believe in me?
Kay:
Don't you worry about that. We're your allies! That's because... we're like birds of a feather! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
(Birds of a feather, huh? ...I suppose that's true.) We have sufficient information about your past. I doubt you had a motive to kill Knightley. Rather, you are probably the most affected by his death. And I doubt someone as timid as you could work up the courage to murder someone. Alright. I'll get you out of here. ...We'll believe in you.
Simon:
I'm so sad... Those words were all lies...
Kay:
I-It wasn't a lie! We really did trust you...!
Simon:
Kay, even you? You said we were like birds of a feather, and yet... I'm hurt, Kay. You've hurt me deeply...
Kay:
I-I-I... oooooh... Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Maybe Simon isn't a bad guy after all...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I see. So that's how you operate. I understand now, all too well. No matter who you face, you find an emotional weakness and exploit it. You guide each person towards the outcome you desire, without them even noticing it. That... is how you were able to mastermind the entire case!
Simon:
........
Edgeworth:
I may have fallen for your tricks before... but, not this time. Simon Keyes. I indict you!
Simon:
...........Hmm. So, it's come to this after all. You were always so full of confidence, Mr. Edgeworth. But, I rather like that. Because now... I can rip that confidence to shreds. Hah... Good work, everyone.
Edgeworth:
(Ngh..... His personality has completely changed!) So, the animal tamer who could not tame animals... That was all a facade. This is the real Simon Keyes.
Regina:
S-Simon! That's not... true, is it!?
Simon:
Truth or lie... What difference does it make?
Regina:
Huh!?
Simon:
Mr. Edgeworth's just made me a little upset, that's all. Keh heh heh heh. ...You'll take responsibility for upsetting me, right?
-- Balloon Practice --
Simon:
It's true. I practiced with the balloon two nights ago.
That photo must have been taken when the balloon and I passed near the building.
I often fly around that area for advertising purposes.
There's nothing unusual about that, right?
Edgeworth:
You often fly around the Grand Tower in the balloon?
Simon:
Yeah. Even the circus needs to advertise.
Edgeworth:
Regina, is that true?
Regina:
Y-Yup. It was Simon's job to advertise using the balloon. Most people who live around here should have seen it.
Edgeworth:
That balloon was used in the crime we were investigating.
Simon:
Like I said, it's just a coincidence. I simply happened to pass by the Grand Tower when that photo was taken.
Edgeworth:
I shall determine whether or not it was a coincidence after I hear your full story.
Rebuttal
-- Balloon Practice --
Simon:
It's true. I practiced with the balloon two nights ago.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Was the balloon launched from this tent?
Simon:
There's a nice, big park near the Sunshine Coliseum. I always launch the balloon there.
Edgeworth:
I see. In that case, how do you transport the balloon to the park?
Simon:
Well, it's too heavy to carry by hand. It weighs several hundred pounds. And yet, it can fly in the sky... Amazing, isn't it?
Edgeworth:
I asked you how you transported it. Now answer the question.
Simon:
Aww, I can't even make some small talk...? You're mean, Mr. Edgeworth. I used a truck. The balloon is loaded onto the back of the truck.
Edgeworth:
A truck...?
Simon:
Yeah. The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. I cannot overlook that piece of testimony...!)
Add statement:
"The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago."
Simon:
The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Allow me to confirm... You haven't driven the truck since then?
Simon:
Do you really need to confirm that? I mean, I just said it five seconds ago.
Edgeworth:
Answer the question. Or would it be inconvenient for you to do so?
Simon:
Ha ha. That's a pretty weak provocation, coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth! What could be inconvenient about something I've already said? Fine, I get it... That truck has been parked behind the dressing rooms since two days ago. And the balloon and basket are still inside. Is there a problem?
Edgeworth:
There's no problem. I simply wanted to express my thanks for that piece of testimony. (So the truck was parked here for the past two days... Heh! That was exactly what I wanted to hear, Mr. Keyes!)
Simon:
...May I continue? So then, regarding the balloon...

Present Blue Truck
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"The truck you put the balloon into. Was it blue, by any chance?"
Simon:
That photo must have been taken when the balloon and I passed near the building.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You're saying it was simply a coincidence that you were photographed near the tower?
Simon:
Ah, I get it. I know how you operate now, Mr. Edgeworth. You'll insist that a coincidence is impossible until you get your way. When you say it like that, everything will inevitably go your way! How scary!
Kay:
Ugh! You're wrong! Mr. Edgeworth isn't like that...
Edgeworth:
Kay, calm down. He's only trying to provoke an emotional response. He intends to goad us into losing our focus, in order to derail the topic at hand. ...Now, why do you think he would do that?
Kay:
Umm, because he's a clown...? No, I mean, because he's trying to hide something, I guess?
Edgeworth:
Exactly, Kay. We must not let up on him. However, we must continue to keep our composure... Understand?
Kay:
Yep! So, Simon. Allow me, as the assistant, to ask you a question! When you passed by the Grand Tower at that precise moment, was it really just a coincidence?
Simon:
...We could've just left things at that. But... ...for the sake of your assistant, I shall explain my reason for being there.
Simon:
I often fly around that area for advertising purposes.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, in addition to advertising with the balloon, maintaining the balloon is also your job. Am I wrong?
Simon:
You're a real stickler for the details, y'know. Yeah, that's right. Ask the boss if you want. ...Right, Boss?
Regina:
Yup. Simon is in charge of cleaning and fixing and all that stuff with the balloon. I don't think anyone besides Simon has used the balloon for a while now.
Edgeworth:
(...Hmm. That confirms he was the one riding the balloon in the photo taken two days ago. However, if he is the mastermind, he must have used it today as well. Am I able to prove that?)
Simon:
Looks like you're deep in thought... Is it really that hard to comprehend? Hot air balloons fly in the sky. And in other news, the sky is blue and the grass is green.
Simon:
There's nothing unusual about that, right?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I wonder about that. You flew the balloon in the middle of the night, eerily close to a certain other incident... Would you say there's nothing strange about that, as well?
Simon:
Mr. Edgeworth, isn't that like a really leading question? Won't you please stop being such a naughty prosecutor? It's kind of downer. It's a clown's job to put smiles on people's faces, after all.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... He ducks and weaves around my questions skillfully. Very well. In that case, I will simply have to make use of a more direct attack!)
Edgeworth:
(We still don't know much about the balloon. In any case, I must draw out more information...)
Edgeworth:
The truck you put the balloon into. Was it blue, by any chance?
Simon:
Blue? So what if it is?
Edgeworth:
Today, we saw a blue truck carrying a large basket. If that truck just so happened to be yours... ...then your claims that you last used it two days ago becomes a lie.
Simon:
........
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang! Ema!
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth! I've finally found you! I've been searching for you ever since the incident yesterday! I dashed right over after Kay contacted me just a little while ago!
Lang:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. The thing you were looking for. I've found it. It was placed in a blue truck at the dressing room parking lot.
Lion Balloon data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
A blue truck... as I suspected. That truck is, without a doubt, the one I saw today.
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
There are a number of blue trucks out there, you know? Who's to say you're not mistaking it for a different one?
Kay:
It's definitely that one! I got a good look at it!
Edgeworth?:
Objection!
Kay:
Huh? Mr. Edgeworth, was that...?
Edgeworth:
I-It wasn't me...!
Simon:
"Kay. Words have no strength without evidence to back them up."
Kay:
Ah! That's Mr. Edgeworth's voice!
Simon:
"Evidence! Present evidence!"
Edgeworth:
(Do I have any evidence... ...to prove that this was the truck I saw today?)
Kay:
Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck?
Edgeworth:
The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time.
Kay:
You can figure all that out just by touching it!?
Edgeworth:
What could prove that this is the truck I saw...?
Looking for bloodstains
Edgeworth:
I'd like to check to see if there are any bloodstains left on the truck.
Simon:
Bloodstains? What's the point of looking for bloodstains? Even if there's a luminol reaction, it's not like it will prove anything, right?
Kay:
I don't really see a point in looking for bloodstains either, Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (I'd better come up with something else.)
Simon:
It's not like our brilliant prosecutor to spout out such nonsense. As I thought, there isn't any evidence at all, is there?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Is there really no evidence?
Edgeworth:
(If this truck is the same as the one I saw today...)
Kay:
Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck?
Edgeworth:
The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time.
Kay:
You can figure all that out just by touching it!?
Edgeworth:
(Then there must have been something left in the truck!)
Leads back to:
"What could prove that this is the truck I saw...?"
Dusting for fingerprints
Leads to:
"I'd like to dust the truck for fingerprints."
Using a metal detector
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe! Please let me use your metal detector.
Kay:
.......... Gummy isn't here! Didn't you ask him to investigate something else for you!?
Edgeworth:
Ack! (I'd completely forgotten...)
Simon:
Using a metal detector on a truck, you sure say some funny things. The whole truck is made of metal. Of course you would get a reaction!
Edgeworth:
Mmph! (I'll have to think of some other way...)
Simon:
It's not like our brilliant prosecutor to spout out such nonsense. As I thought, there isn't any evidence at all, is there?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Is there really no evidence?
Edgeworth:
(If this truck is the same as the one I saw today...)
Kay:
Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck?
Edgeworth:
The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time.
Kay:
You can figure all that out just by touching it!?
Edgeworth:
(Then there must have been something left in the truck!)
Leads back to:
"What could prove that this is the truck I saw...?"
Edgeworth:
I'd like to dust the truck for fingerprints.
Simon:
Eh!? Fingerprints? What for? I don't see any point in that!
Edgeworth:
A certain person's fingerprints should be left on this truck. And these fingerprints will prove this truck was parked in front of the Grand Tower today! (Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?)
Miles' fingerprints
Leads to:
"Edgeworth...? Your fingerprints?"
Simon's fingerprints
Simon:
My fingerprints? Wouldn't they be all over the truck anyways? After all, I'm the one who drives the truck! Finding my fingerprints on it doesn't prove a thing!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (I guess he has a point...)
Kay:
We're looking for whoever left fingerprints on the truck in front of the tower, right? In that case, there's only one person it could be!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It's obvious who must have touched it.
Leads back to:
"(Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?)"
Lotta's fingerprints
Lotta:
Eh!? Yer sayin' they're MY fingerprints...!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. We should be able to find your fingerprints on the truck. You touched the truck when it was in front of the tower, did you not?
Lotta:
I hate to break it to ya, but... ...I... don't reckon I ever touched that truck at all.
Edgeworth:
Argh! (It seems I was mistaken...)
Kay:
We're looking for whoever left fingerprints on the truck in front of the tower, right? In that case, there's only one person it could be!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It's obvious who must have touched it.
Leads back to:
"(Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?)"
Simon:
Edgeworth...? Your fingerprints?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Earlier today, I touched a truck at the plaza in front of the Grand Tower. I'd like to dust for my prints. Ema, might I request a scientific investigation?
Ema:
That's what I'm here for! Just leave it to me! Alright, we're all set! Go ahead, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Wait... You want me to do it?
Ema:
Of course. Who else but Mr. Edgeworth would be up to the task? Here, I'll show you how it's done!
Edgeworth:
Umm... Alright, then. (You're the scientist, why don't you just do it yourself...?)
Ema:
First, we sprinkle some aluminum powder over the area you want to investigate. Like this.
Edgeworth:
(Touch the screen to sprinkle the aluminum powder.)
Ema:
The powder will adhere to the fingerprints, so once you've sprinkled enough... ...you blow it away!
Edgeworth:
Blow it away?
Ema:
Yeah, just blow on it, with your breath. Fwooosh.
Edgeworth:
(Blow the powder away by blowing into the microphone.)
Ema:
Got it?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I think so. (I guess we'll do it for real this time...)
Ema:
Just so you know, the key point is to sprinkle the powder all over.
Obtain fingerprint
Leads to:
"We got one! That's a nice, clean fingerprint!"
Ema:
We got one! That's a nice, clean fingerprint!
Edgeworth:
Let's run the prints against mine posthaste.
Ema:
Alright! Just leave it to me! These are definitely your fingerprints, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Well, it seems to me that we have just proven your statement to be a lie.
Simon:
Ugh!
Lang:
What were you doing when you were driving this truck around?
Simon:
Just... taking it for a joyride?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Kay was abducted two nights ago. Your balloon was sighted not far from the scene. Today, there was another kidnapping, in which a garbage truck was used... ...and once again, your truck was seen nearby.
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
This all sounds like nothing more than a pure coincidence to me...
Edgeworth:
So it was pure coincidence that you parked near two separate kidnappings? I doubt that. You were involved in both kidnappings, weren't you?
Simon:
Isn't it a bit rash to automatically assume that the two kidnappings were connected?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
And what if I had evidence to prove that the two crimes were performed by the same culprit?
Simon:
Oh! You're serious!? I can't wait to hear this!
Edgeworth:
What did Kay and John's kidnappings have in common?
Present Sleeping Drugs
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Kay was knocked out with a powerful sleeping drug."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence shows that the same culprit was behind both kidnappings!
Simon:
Oh? And just what part of that evidence shows that, exactly?
Edgeworth:
Hmm. I'd say... around here?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Try to sound a bit more confident, will ya!?
Simon:
Gyahahaha! You don't actually have a clue what you're talking about, do you?
Edgeworth:
...Ugh! (He saw through me...)
Kay:
If the same culprit was behind both kidnapping cases, he must have used the same method... Let's look at the evidence related to the kidnappings again!
Edgeworth:
Right. Perhaps then all will become clear.
Simon:
What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Run out of evidence?
Edgeworth:
No. I have evidence, and I can prove that the culprit in both kidnappings was the same!
Leads back to:
"What did Kay and John's kidnappings have in common?"
Edgeworth:
Kay was knocked out with a powerful sleeping drug. And a bottle of sleeping drugs was found lying in the place where John was confined. The contents of the bottle were a match with the drugs used on Kay.
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
......So that's all you've got, huh? And here I was, getting my hopes up. So the same sleeping drugs were used. So what? You think that connects the two incidents? Surely, you must realize it yourself? That doesn't prove a thing.
Edgeworth:
Ngh...! (Th-There must be something... Evidence that proves he is connected to those cases...!)
Simon:
The police, prosecutors, and even you, Mr. Edgeworth. In the end, you're all the same. You make up evidence as you see fit, just so you can send some poor soul to prison. Isn't there someone like that here? A poor soul who was wrongly accused in the past?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You're wrong! Wh... Who would do such a thing!?
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
Then show me the evidence! If you're going to accuse me of a crime, it's only natural!
Edgeworth:
(Ngh......... It's no use. I can't seem to find any other threads linking him to the kidnappings...!)
Simon:
Now then. Have you finally run out of ammo, Mr. Edgeworth? I still have preparations to make at the circus, so if you'll excuse me...
Ray:
Objection!
Ray:
Now, now, you two... No need to get so heated. And Simon... You're looking good in that clown makeup!
Simon:
H-Hey, what's your deal!? Don't just butt in like that...
Ray:
Uncle Ray's not so good in such a stiff environment. I mean, why so serious, right? Hey, Kay! How about a little trick?
Kay:
At last, my moment has arrived! The Great Kay Faraday presents... a Simon impression! "O-Objectiooon...!"
Simon:
Wha... Wh-Why you! Enough already!
Ray:
...Psst. Hey, Miles. I'm buying you some time to get all your ducks in a row. There's probably a better way to stall for time than this, but whatevs. Woo! Nice one, Kay!
Edgeworth:
(I'm not so sure about this method, either... ...but I have to find something that connects Simon to the case... And I need to find it now! Is there evidence not related to the kidnapping that's connected to the mastermind's identity? That's it...! The mastermind is the same person as the young acolyte Dogen was looking for. If I can just connect the young acolyte to Simon... Which piece of evidence could be connected with the mastermind's true identity...?)
Present Correspondence Chess Memo
Edgeworth:

I've found it...! This is the evidence that connects you to the case!
Simon:
Really, now? That's interesting. Well then, show me how it's connected!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Leave it to me. If you hold it like this, and turn it this way...
Kay:
"Too baaad! Epic fall, Mr. Edgewooorth!"
Edgeworth:
Gwooooh! (Wh-Whose side are you on, anyways...? Something... I have to find something! It simply must exist! Evidence that shows the mastermind is connected to those involved in this case...!)
Leads back to:
"(Which piece of evidence could be connected with the mastermind's true identity...?)"
Edgeworth:
Knightley and Dogen both communicated through a certain individual...
Dogen:
Oh...? Then that somebody must be...
Edgeworth:
...the mastermind behind the case.
Edgeworth:
(That's it... The mastermind played a role in the correspondence chess... If I can prove that it was Simon, then...!)
Simon:
That's enough. I can't stomach any more of your sorry excuse for a performance. If you have no more objections, then I ask that you let me get back to preparing for the show.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...Thank you for the help, Mr. Shields. (Though you may have taken it a little too far...)
Ray:
You sure look happy. I take it you've found something?
Kay:
"Look at me! I'm Zimon! Zimon ze Klown...! Ze funny, funny klown!"
Edgeworth:
Kay, you can stop now. Now then... Mr. Keyes. Do you happen to like chess?
Simon:
Hmph. That was rather out-of-the-blue. But since you asked, I can't say that I dislike chess.
Edgeworth:
The mastermind played correspondence chess with Sirhan Dogen.
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
If I recall, it was Knightley who had been playing chess with Dogen, wasn't it? Are you saying that he was the mastermind?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There was no way Knightley could have been the mastermind. The reason being... ...the mastermind had continued to work behind the scenes even after Knightley's death. That being the case, who could have written this letter? I believe someone acted as the middleman between Dogen and Knightley.
Simon:
So, you're saying that you think I'm the middleman? Ha ha ha! And just why would I have to go to all that trouble and do something like that?
Edgeworth:
Most likely, to make it appear as if there was a connection between Knightley and Dogen. And, as a result... Knightley was killed by Patricia Roland.
Kay:
N-No way! Are you saying it was all set up so that he would be killed by her!?
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
What are you saying!? There's no way I could manipulate a person that far! Look at me! It takes all I have just to get the animals to perform tricks!
Edgeworth:
(If only just a scrap of the letters he exchanged with Knightley still remained... ...it'd be decisive evidence!) I'd like to investigate your room. There could be decisive...
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
If it's the letters you're looking for, you won't find any in there.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Simon:
I'm the type of guy who throws his letters away as soon as he's done reading them. Where's the point in living in the past?
Edgeworth:
(Ngh! Does that mean he's already gotten rid of the evidence...!?)
Simon:
Mr. Edgeworth... Everything you have said so far has been nothing more than baseless conjecture.
Edgeworth:
(The evidence... I'm just one step behind it! What should I do? Am I all out of moves...?)
Simon:
Without evidence, I won't allow you to cast doubt on my friendship with Knightley!
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Wh-Who was that?
Regina:
Ah! Excuse me!
Edgeworth:
(Ms. Berry? What's on her mind?)
Regina:
I've been... listening in on what you all were saying, and, umm... When you say Mr. Knightley... You mean Simon's friend, Mr. Knightley, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes, that's correct... (Does she know something?)
Regina:
This morning, a letter arrived from Mr. Knightley. It was for Simon.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Simon:
What did you say...!?
Edgeworth:
(But that's impossible! Knightley's already dead...!) Ms. Berry! Please, let me see that letter!
Regina:
OK! Here you go.
Kay:
Quick, open it!
Edgeworth:
This is... a correspondence chess letter!
Kay:
This is the response to Dogen's last move!
Knightley:
Now, can you see the path to checkmate? I can't wait to see the look on your face... You weren't expecting to lose at chess against me, right?
Edgeworth:
The postmark says March 26th... The day before Knightley's death. It seems the letter arrived late.
Regina:
Since the circus moves around so much, a lot of the mail people send us arrive late.
Edgeworth:
Now, why was this letter addressed to you?
Simon:
.....Ngh!
Edgeworth:
This is proof that you were the middleman between Dogen and Knightley. Normally, you would transcribe this letter into braille before sending it to Dogen. And in doing so, you created a connection between him and Knightley!
Simon:
Dammiiiiiit! Curse you, Knightley! Why must you continue to interfere!?
Kay:
Simon... Why!? Wasn't Knightley your only friend?
Simon:
Hah! Don't be ridiculous. I stopped thinking of him as a friend 18 years ago.
Edgeworth:
18 years ago...? Would that have been the day of the IS-7 Incident?
Simon:
...Thanks to Knightley, I nearly died that day in the snowstorm. While I was on my way to the contest venue, where my father was waiting... ...Knightley suddenly appeared. He held me down... tied up my hands and feet, and with tears streaming down his face... ...he kept apologizing, "My dad's too scary, I can't disobey him. Please forgive me! I'm sorry!"
Simon:
Stop it, Horace! I promised my dad! I said I'd taste his desserts... If I'm not there, Dad will be in trouble! I'm gonna let everyone know my Dad's desserts are the best in the world...!
Simon:
After that, he locked us inside a car. It was so cold, I could see my own breath. Before we knew it, the doors had frozen shut, and not even he could get them open. And then... I lost my father!
Edgeworth:
Wha...!
Kay:
Your father...!
Simon:
Horace Knightley was the son of the murderer who killed my father!
Edgeworth:
(What could this mean? His confession runs contrary to the information we have...)
Ray:
But the name of the victim in the IS-7 Incident was Isaac Dover...
Simon:
Isaac Dover is my father's name. 18 years ago, my memories were muddled from the shock of my near-death experience... So it wasn't until later that I learned the truth. On that day, my father was murdered.
Edgeworth:
...The culprit of the IS-7 Incident was a confectioner by the name of Dane Gustavia.
Simon:
Heh... So that was the name of Knightley's father. That lowlife scum of the earth killed my father. Just the thought of him makes me sick.
Edgeworth:
So you knew who the culprit was all along?
Simon:
Hah... Of course not. Had I known, I would've tipped off the police a long time ago. All I knew was that Knightley's father was trying to set up my own father. That's why I immediately knew that the one who died that day was my dad. Knightley had a hand in my father's murder, that traitor! He was the son of a killer! It's only natural that he ended up dead!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...It would appear that you are a victim of a very serious misunderstanding.
Simon:
Misunderstanding...? Just what're you talking about?
Edgeworth:
Isaac Dover... At the time, he was actively working as a sculptor in France... ...under the name Pierre Hoquet.
Simon:
Is that right? Well, I'm sorry to say, I don't remember that at all.
Edgeworth:
Heh... It's only natural you don't remember. After all, he's not your real father.
Simon:
...Huh? What, is that supposed to be a joke? I am not amused.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... You won't be able to laugh at all, once I reveal the truth to you. This piece of evidence proves that you are not Isaac Dover's son!
Present Knightley's Mementos
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"What's that? Isn't that Knightley's chessboard and his ring?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Simon:
What's that supposed to tell me?
Edgeworth:
Can't you see? This shows that you and Dover aren't...
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
Mr. Edgeworth. That doesn't prove anything. I honestly don't have a clue what you're trying to get at.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (It seems I was wrong...)
Ray:
Hang in there, Miles. Who was really Mr. Dover's son...? If you keep calm and think it through, the answer should come naturally.
Edgeworth:
(Isaac Dover's real son...?)
Simon:
Mr. Edgeworth. Stop joking around. There's no doubt that I'm Isaac Dover's son.
Edgeworth:
No. I'm sorry, Mr. Keyes, but that's just simply not possible.
Leads back to:
"This piece of evidence proves that you are not Isaac Dover's son!"
Simon:
What's that? Isn't that Knightley's chessboard and his ring?
Edgeworth:
I want you to take a good look at this ring's design.
Simon:
...There are two letters inscribed in it.
Edgeworth:
That is the seal Pierre Hoquet used as his signature. 18 years ago, it was found lying near the body of Isaac Dover.
Simon:
! Wh... Why would Knightley have my father's memento with him!?
Edgeworth:
The police had found Isaac Dover's son and gave it to him. Isaac Dover's real son... is Horace Knightley.
Simon:
Wh... What!? B-But that means, I'm...!
Edgeworth:
In other words... you are Dane Gustavia's son!
Simon:
That's... that's a lie! After all, I'm... My... father is.....! My memories are.....! I lost my father because Knightley locked me up in the car...! That's why, I thought it would be fitting if he were killed as well!
Knightley:
Really!? I'll be able to see a circus show, even in prison? Heh. I enjoy playing chess with you, but I'm looking forward to your performance as well.
Simon:
......Yes. Please look forward to it.
Knightley:
Alright! You better drop by again. I'll be thinking about my next move!
Simon:
Oh yeah. I've left something special inside that chessboard for you. You should check it out later.
Knightley:
Something special? I'm not quite sure what you mean, but thanks. I owe you one, Simon.
Simon:
......If only you hadn't stopped me 18 years ago... ...it wouldn't have had... to come to this.
Knightley:
Huh? Did you say something?
Simon:
Nope. Not a word. ......Goodbye, Horace.
Simon:
After all that...! You're saying it was my father who killed Knightley's? Then, that means... Was it all for nothing...!? I didn't want to become some weakling who could be killed by anyone... That's why... I thought I'd follow in Mr. Dogen's footsteps!
Edgeworth:
This finally proves it... Simon Keyes! You are Dogen's correspondence chess partner... ...and the mastermind behind this case!
Simon:
............ GYAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That's right! It was me! I'm the mastermind behind it all!
Edgeworth:
(He's finally showing his true colors...!)
Simon:
As you all know, I witnessed the incident 12 years ago.
Edgeworth:
(President Huang's assassination...! So the child who drew that picture was Simon Keyes...)
Simon:
When I was found out... ...I was subjected to horrible interrogations over and over by that heartless Patricia. I'd spend the nights trembling in my bed, terrified of what the next day would bring! I'm sure you can understand why I'd want to sneak out of there, right?
Edgeworth:
However... Blaise would have likely sent pursuers after you.
Simon:
Exactly. I was on the run from them every waking moment. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I couldn't even sleep at night, I'd jump at the slightest noise. ...And that's why I became a circus performer. Blaise Debeste was the Chief Prosecutor, and Patricia Roland was the warden of the prison. No ordinary person would be a match for those two. And there were no adults I could rely on. Furthermore, behind the scenes was the body double who had set those two in motion. Though he was a fake, I was up against a nation's president... Talk about utter despair, right? My only ally was Mr. Dogen... He saved my life, after all. He actually helped me out. Unlike Knightley.
Edgeworth:
(If this story is true... Hmph. It's ironic. Dogen, the fiendish assassin, was idolized by the child he saved.)
Simon:
If I followed in his footsteps, I'd no longer have to worry about being eaten alive. That's right. Now it's my turn... My turn to devour those who would feed upon me!
Edgeworth:
And I suppose you never thought to seek help from the police.
Simon:
Nowaynoway! As long as Blaise was around, any evidence would be destroyed by him. Actually, didn't something like that almost happen today during Patricia's trial? I knew from the very beginning. That things would turn out like this.
Edgeworth:
(The evidence from Patricia Roland's trial... So he's saying that he expected the evidence would be destroyed...) I see. So that's why you kidnapped John... ...to force a Guilty verdict, even in the absense of evidence!
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
Who's to say. But, in order to expose the crimes of 12 years ago, there was no other choice.
Edgeworth:
That's according to you. However, Blaise also... ...attempted to kidnap John in order to manipulate the trial in his favor... Your methods are no different than those of the people you so despise!
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
That's only if I were actually the kidnapper. But I would never do anything so evil. Nowaynowaynoway, I just simply couldn't! Besides, Mr. Edgeworth. I'm actually quite thankful to the real criminals... ...for giving me the opportunity to extract such sweet revenge! Ke he heh... Gyahahahahahaha!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...So you admit it. Your motive was revenge.
Simon:
Yeah, I admit it. So what? Sure, I held a grudge against those creeps. But... it's not like I'm the one who actually killed them, ya know?
Edgeworth:
.....!
Simon:
Truth be told, all I did was send some letters. I let Jill in on Blaise's secrets, and let Blaise in on Jill's secrets. And then, the two simply ended up trying to kill each other.
Courtney:
Do you mean to say the murder was nothing more than a result of that!?
Simon:
Yep! Just like the case at Gourd Lake. It's way easier than trying to control wild animals. All I did was come up with the fake assassination plan for Knightley.
Edgeworth:
(So that was also a part of his plan...!) If that's the case, then Rooke's murder was also your...
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
Whoa! Don't try to pin that on me. Knightley killed him all on his own. Well, it ended up creating the perfect opportunity for me... It's funny how things work out!
Kay:
How can you say such a thing...!?
Simon:
It was the same for Patricia Roland. I made it look like there was a connection between Knightley and Dogen... ...by using the correspondence chess match and the chisel in the chessboard.
Edgeworth:
What!? You mean to say that you were the one who prepared that chisel!?
Simon:
That's right! I thought it would bring Dogen to mind. Quite a thoughtful little gift, wouldn't you agree? And that was all it took to get Patricia to murder Knightley! Oh, the feeling that everyone around you is an enemy. Heh heh. I know it all too well. The tiniest spark can set off an explosion of fear, resulting in... horrific mutual destruction. All I did was watch the comedy of errors unfold from the audience. And you were my final pawn, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
A pawn... Me...?
Simon:
When you solved their cases, you brought both Blaise and Patricia to their run... ...and the weapon that delivered the coup de grâce was your own logic!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I didn't solve those cases for your sake!
Simon:
Oh, I know. You never really cared about saving me. You just wanted to pretend to be a defense attorney, didn't you?
Edgeworth:
What did you...!?
Simon:
All I had to do was go, "nowaynowaynoway" and act all scared... ...and you totally believed me. You were giving it your all trying to save me.
Edgeworth:
Ngh...! So even your arrest was just a ploy to make me use my logic...?
Simon:
To be fair, getting arrested wasn't part of the plan. When people began to suspect that the chisel I sent was the murder weapon... ...honestly, I broke out in a cold sweat. I thought for sure it would be curtains for me. But then, a turnabout of miraculous proportions! The genius prosecutor himself had come to my rescue! Well? Doesn't it feel nice to be thanked by me, the one that you saved? You should be grateful! I gave you this chance to play the ace attorney!
Kay:
You're wrong! He wasn't pretending to be a defense attorney! Mr. Edgeworth is always serious about saving people...! Even the times when he saved me in the past...!
Edgeworth:
(Kay...!)
Simon:
Gyahahahahahaha! Is that so? Are you sure he's not just trying to emulate his own father, the one he admires SO much!?
Kay:
Absolutely not! That's not true at all!
Ray:
Now, now, Kay. The person he's talking about now isn't Miles, but rather, Simon himself. Clearly, he is not able to trust others. The desire to save someone other than himself is something he cannot even comprehend...
Simon:
Say what you want. But make sure you think about it long and hard. Sure, all my targets for revenge got what they deserved in the end. However...
-- Instigating Murder? --
Simon:
Think about it. Can any one of my actions really be considered a crime?
I instigated murder? There's not a single word about that in the letter, is there?
If I had said the word "kill" even once, I guess it could be considered instigation.
Well, maybe I did say it. But there's no way for you to prove it.
Kay:
What are you saying!? You kidnapped me!
Simon:
I'm sorry, but that hasn't been proven yet, has it? The only thing I admitted to was sending the letters.
Kay:
That's...!
Simon:
Besides, those letters contained no threats or coercions. I simply conveyed information. Information that each recipient would find beneficial.
Edgeworth:
Ngh... (You crafty little...!)
Kay:
Can't we do something about it? Umm... what was it he said? Integrating murder?
Edgeworth:
Instigating murder is when a person directs someone else to commit murder. The person who directed the murder can be charged as if he committed the crime himself.
Kay:
So we just have to find proof that he directed those murders!
Simon:
You make it sound so easy... To be honest, it kinda pisses me off a little. You're all trying to frame an innocent person for murder. Don't you understand? I'm not obligated to waste any more time on this pointless discussion.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
The police are waiting for you outside of this tent! You have nowhere to run!
Simon:
Really now? You think I wouldn't have an escape route prepared? For example, let's say... ...I gave an order so that all the animals here attacked you! Now, what if I were to take my leave during the ensuing chaos?
Lang:
What'd you say!? You... can't be serious...
Simon:
Gyahahahaha! It was just an example! Wouldn't that make for an interesting show? Here's another idea: what if I pulled out a hidden gun and took John hostage? Mmm. That might be more exciting!
Courtney:
I-I will never allow you to do such a thing!
Edgeworth:
(I can't tell whether or not Simon is being serious... ...however, when it comes to him, we should consider anything a possibility!)
Simon:
If you continue to bore with your drivel, I'll end the show right here. I'd like you to keep that in mind before you make any baseless objections!
Edgeworth:
(Ngh...! I cannot make any careless remarks...! Isn't there some way I can charge him with his crimes?)
Rebuttal
-- Instigating Murder? --
Simon:
Think about it. Can any one of my actions really be considered a crime?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You incited others to commit murder, and they did so. If proof of that was established, you would be charged as if you yourself committed the murders.
Kay:
...Umm, I know I heard it just a while ago, but what's the technical term again?
Edgeworth:
It's "instigating murder", Kay. Blaise, Patricia Roland, and Knightley... Their crimes are unforgivable, of course. However, the one who pulled the strings from behind the scenes, and drove them all to murder... ...was none other than you, Simon Keyes!
Simon:
Aha, aha, gyahahahahah! Mr. Edgeworth, you really do speak your mind freely. But you know...
Simon:
I instigated murder? There's not a single word about that in the letter, is there?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
There's not... a single word?
Simon:
Oh, does that surprise you? You'd reach the same conclusion if you examined it.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. Given his composure... I'd say he's not bluffing. Does this mean that every single word in his letters had been carefully calculated...!?)
Simon:
Well, I guess you could say this is like teaching a monkey to climb a tree. Unless you can somehow prove that I caused those murders, you've got nothing on me. ...Ergo, you can't assume me of instigating murder. Heh heh heh... What a shame, Mr. Edgeworth.
Simon:
If I had said the word "kill" even once, I guess it could be considered instigation.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I know you instigated the murder!
???:
Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Edgeworth:
You told me yourself.
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
But you know, the funny thing is, it means absolutely nothing if you have no proof. I mean, there's no way I'd ever say something like that. Nowaynowaynoway!
Edgeworth:
(Ngh... that's certainly true. It means absolutely nothing if I can't prove it. If there was some evidence that could prove what he said over the phone...)
Simon:
Well, maybe I did say it. But there's no way for you to prove it.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
"Maybe you did say it"? Did you or didn't you!?
Simon:
Gyahahahah! It doesn't really matter whether I did or didn't! That's not what's important. I'm sure you know full well, Mr. Edgeworth. There's no way to prove it. There's no way any proof could exist!
Edgeworth:
Ngh...! (Until I find some sort of proof, my arguments are meaningless. Should I press him to draw out more information, or review the evidence...? At any rate, I must find some way to break through his defense!)
Present Nicole's Tape Recorder
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"It is my firm conviction that you instigated the murders."
Before pressing third statement
Kay:
Is Simon really innocent of instigating the murders?
Edgeworth:
That's impossible. I'm certain that it was all part of his murder plot.
Kay:
Yeah.
Edgeworth:
We know he had the will to commit the crimes... We just need some way to prove it...
After pressing third statement
Edgeworth:
(He confessed to me over the phone. He told me he had Blaise kill Mrs. Crane... If only there was some evidence that could prove what he said over the phone...
Edgeworth:
It is my firm conviction that you instigated the murders. After all, you told me so yourself...
???:
Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Simon:
Did I say that? I really don't remember.
Edgeworth:
You may think you can deceive us as much as you want... ...but unfortunately for you...
Simon:
Unfortunately...?
Edgeworth:
You used a bug to eavesdrop on our conversations... ...but there was someone else who wiretapped that bug of yours and recorded the whole thing.
Simon:
It was... recorded?
Lang:
In other words, the conversation between you and that clown is recorded on that tape!?
Simon:
Ngh.......!
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "A schemer drowns in his own schemes!" And this is what he meant!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift. I'd like to listen to your tape.
Nicole:
Rooooger! Ah! It's right about here!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Judge Courtney's cellphone is ringing!
Edgeworth:
Who is this? ...Are you the person who ambushed Kay?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too!
Edgeworth:
Very well.
Edgeworth:
(This is where it starts...)
???:
Well, I must say...... ..............
Nicole:
Huh? That's odd...
Edgeworth:
What's wrong?
Nicole:
Well... there ain't nothin' recorded past this point!
Edgeworth:
Whaaaaaaaat!?
Kay:
Why!? Why wasn't it recorded!?
Simon:
.......Keh heh heh heh. Gyahahahahahahahahah! Too bad, so sad. Did you really think I'd leave behind any incriminating evidence? The bug I planted has a special feature. It can be turned on and off with a remote control.
Kay:
Whaaaaat!? That sort of thing exists!?
Lang:
Certainly, remote controlled listening devices do exist. However...
Courtney:
Are you saying you switched off the device so that your own voice would not be recorded?
Simon:
Precisely!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Impossible! You couldn't have done that unless you knew you were being recorded...!
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
Isn't it obvious I knew? I guess you just don't get it. ...You could call it a hunch. I had a feeling I was being wiretapped. Ms. Swift... was it? I figured things out because you knew about the kidnapping.
Edgeworth:
(Don't tell me...) You were listening in on that conversation!?
Simon:
That's right! Though come to think of it... I'm surprised you didn't realize it until now! Some genius prosecutor you turned out to be, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Ngh!
Simon:
Oh my? And what was the end result of all this? Ah! Since you don't have any proof of the instigation charges, it's Game Over.
Edgeworth:
Ngh...
Nicole:
Mr. Prosecutor, was my recordin' no help to you at all? Ain't there... somethin'... anythin' at all in my recordin'...?
Edgeworth:
(Ms. Swift...)
Ray:
Kay.
Kay:
Y-Yes?
Ray:
The bug was planted in your badge, right? Do you have any ideas?
Kay:
How do you expect me to come up with an answer right off the top of my head!?
Franziska:
You were the only one who came into contact with the culprit!
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
How unsightly. You're all fussing over useless evidence. Let's move on to the next topic! Next!
Edgeworth:
(What's this...? He seems a bit eager to change the topic of conversation...?)
Franziska:
You were the only one who came into contact with the culprit!
Edgeworth:
(Only Kay... came into contact with Simon... If any sound was recorded at the time she was with the culprit...) Ms. Swift! How long have you been recording?
Nicole:
Since two nights ago, I reckon...
Edgeworth:
(Since two nights ago... In that case... When could a conversation with Simon possibly have been recorded?)
Two nights ago
Leads to:
"(Two nights ago... Simon brought Kay to the roof.)"
Last night
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift! Could we listen to last night's recording?
Nicole:
Last night? I don't mind, but...
Edgeworth:
The culprit's conversation should have been recorded at that time.
Ray:
Miles! Last night, Kay was... ...with you! That would make you seem like the culprit!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (It seems I was wrong...)
Nicole:
Mr. Prosecutor, was my recordin' no help to you after all?
Edgeworth:
(At the time when Kay was kidnapped by the culprit... ...it's possible the bug may have picked up the culprit's voice. In which case, the culprit's conversation should still be left on the tape!)
Leads back to:
"(When could a conversation with Simon possibly have been recorded?)"
This morning
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift! Could we listen to this morning's recording?
Nicole:
This morning? Sure, that's fine, but...
Kay:
Didn't you have my badge with you this morning, Mr. Edgeworth? And also, don't forget that you were inside the detention cell... So wouldn't your voice be the only one on there?
Edgeworth:
Nwaaargh! (I had forgotten that...)
Nicole:
Mr. Prosecutor, was my recordin' no help to you after all?
Edgeworth:
(At the time when Kay was kidnapped by the culprit... ...it's possible the bug may have picked up the culprit's voice. In which case, the culprit's conversation should still be left on the tape!)
Leads back to:
"(When could a conversation with Simon possibly have been recorded?)"
Edgeworth:
(Two nights ago... Simon brought Kay to the roof. If we listen to the recording from that time frame...!) Ms. Swift! Please let us listen to the recording from two nights ago!
Nicole:
Huh? O-Okie-dokie!
........
Kay:
Th-This is...! The sound of a hot air balloon!
Edgeworth:
That's right. At the time, Simon was carrying Kay in a hot air balloon. Ergo, he was near Kay.
Simon:
........
Edgeworth:
(Isn't there anything recorded?)
........ .....*BANG*... *CLANG*
Kay:
Ah! Th-That was...!
Lang:
...a-a gunshot!
Simon:
........
...*vrrr*... *bzt*
Edgeworth:
Heh. It seems you were quick to deactivate the bug. However... you were a little too late. You can't run anymore. That gunshot ties you to the case!
Simon:
Huh? What are you saying? There's no gun involved in this case, is there?
Edgeworth:
(No... there should be someone connected to the case who fired a gun. Let's strike with the evidence that points to that person!) Which piece of evidence connects the gunshot to the case?
Present Crime Scene Notes
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It's written right here, in the body double's autopsy report..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Simon:
What's that supposed to tell me?
Edgeworth:
Could you perhaps take a look at this piece of evidence?
Simon:
Are you saying that this proves a gun is related to the case?
Edgeworth:
...That is what I believe. Are you saying that I'm wrong?
Simon:
Gyahahahah! I don't think it has any connection at all!
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (It seems this wasn't it.)
Ray:
This isn't like you, Miles! Think about it a little harder!
Edgeworth:
...I-I'm sorry.
Kay:
The person who fired the gun could be the same person who kidnapped me, right?
Edgeworth:
That's possible. However... It seems we can't be sure. To see if there is something that connects those involved in the case with a gun... ...we should review the evidence once more.
Simon:
What are you mumbling about? As I thought, the gun isn't related at all, is it?
Edgeworth:
No, the gunshot that was recorded is greatly related to this case.
Leads back to:
"Which piece of evidence connects the gunshot to the case?"
Edgeworth:
It's written right here, in the body double's autopsy report... Gunpowder residue was detected on his right hand.
Simon:
...Ngh.
Edgeworth:
Where was Kay at the time this gunshot was recorded? That's right. She was being carried to the roof of the Grand Tower in your balloon. And as it turns out, there were a few more people on that very same rooftop at the time...
Courtney:
You mean the double and me... Ah! Certainly, after we talked for a brief moment... ...the body double noticed something and had me leave before him.
Edgeworth:
Now, what if the gunshot rang out after that? We clearly hear it in the recording. I doubt that you wouldn't have noticed it.
Simon:
.......
Edgeworth:
Do you intend to feign ignorance until the very end?
Simon:
That's nothing more than mere conjecture.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
What we heard on the recording was not just a gunshot...
.....*BANG*... *CLANG*
Lang:
If you listen closely, you can hear the bullet hitting something!
Edgeworth:
(If the body double was aiming at Simon, then...) The bullet may have struck which piece of evidence?
Present Lion Balloon
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The body double likely fired the gun at the balloon."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Kay:
Ehhh!? Did the bullet really hit that thing?
Simon:
Gyahahahah! That surprised me too!
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. It looks like he's totally clowning around with you. Well... I don't think that's the right evidence either.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhooh! (To be rebutted this much...)
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. Do you really understand? If you think about who the double was aiming at, the answer should be clear.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. The bullet could only have hit that piece of evidence.
Leads back to:
"The bullet may have struck which piece of evidence?"
Edgeworth:
The body double likely fired the gun at the balloon. If we assume that the bullet hit something... it would have been the balloon's basket.
Kay:
Let's examine it immediately!
Examine basket
Edgeworth:
This basket needs to be examined from every angle. Please be thorough.
Kay:
Yep! I'll start with this end!
Lang:
Hey! You guys give 'em a hand!
MIB:
Yes, Shifu!
Kay:
.....Aww, nothing here. Did you guys find anything on your end?
MIB:
Nothing at all! Not a even single speck of dust!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. I expected as much. The sound made on impact... ...sounded more metallic than anything the basket's woven material could produce...)
Examine rope on inside
Kay:
There's a long rope all coiled up inside.
Edgeworth:
We must examine it closely for any signs of it being cut by a bullet.
Kay:
Got it! Mr. MIB, you start from that end!
MIB:
Y-Yeah! Nothing here... or here... Nope! There's no sign of it being hit by a bullet!
Kay:
There's nothing on this end either. I guess it didn't hit the rope.
Edgeworth:
Let's not waste any time. On to the next spot.
Examine gas tank on inside
Edgeworth:
There's a gas tank here. It's attached to the basket.
Kay:
Umm... I don't think we would be looking at this tank right now if a bullet had hit it. In fact, neither Simon or I would still be here. We would have been blown sky high.
Edgeworth:
Let's look elsewhere, then.
Examine bullet hole on under
Leads to:
"This hole...!"
Edgeworth:
This hole...!
Kay:
It's a bullet hole!
Edgeworth:
A bullet hole was found in the basket. You won't be able to talk your way out of this one.
Lion Balloon data updated in my Organizer.
Simon:
Ngh!
Examine evidence
Basket on Lion Balloon
Kay:
I... took a ride in this basket, didn't I?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. You had been drugged, so it would make sense if you don't remember it.
Kay:
Aww... He could have at least kept me awake so I could enjoy the hot air balloon ride. I'll never forgive you, Mr. Mastermind! Beat him to a pulp, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry to disappoint, Kay, but if I did that I would be arrested for battery...
Rope on inside of Lion Balloon
Kay:
Once we've proven he's the culprit, let's tie him up with this rope! As an expert in rope escapes, I know how to make knots that can never be untied!
Edgeworth:
I appreciate the enthusiasm, but handcuffs seem like a more reliable alternative.
Gas tank on inside of Lion Balloon
Kay:
Never fear! I'll guard the gas tank! I'll stop Simon from trying to escape with the balloon!
Edgeworth:
I... find it hard to imagine that he would try a stunt like that.
Kay:
Never fear! Just focus on putting him behind bars, Mr. Edgeworth!
Bullet hole on under Lion Balloon
Edgeworth:
The gunshot fired by the body double was recorded on the tape. And this was where the bullet hit its mark. There's no way Simon can deny that now!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, you absolutely HAVE to expose the truth! I even got kidnapped in order to steal this evidence!
Edgeworth:
(Leaving aside whether or not I would call that "stealing"...) Of course, that was my intention all along. I absolutely won't let him escape!
Edgeworth:
How do you intend to explain the gunshot and bullet hole?
Simon:
Keh heh heh. So you've figured it out. You're good. I guess it's impossible to hide anything from you.
Lang:
Spit it out already!
Simon:
OK, OK. No need to be impatient!
-- Two Nights Ago --
Simon:
It happened when I was riding the balloon to the rooftop.
I saw the body double and you, Ms. Courtney, on the roof. Talk about a surprise.
Only the double noticed me. He told Ms. Courtney to leave ahead of him.
He then pointed a gun at me and fired.
Kay:
Why did he want to shoot down the balloon?
Simon:
It's simple. The body double had intended to kill Ms. Courtney.
Courtney:
K-Kill me...?
Simon:
That's right! You talked to the double about John, didn't you? Well, it's not like the body double would have met with you otherwise... From his point of view, it was like showing him evidence that he was a fake.
Edgeworth:
You mean, he was afraid of Judge Courtney because she knew about John's past?
Simon:
Afraid... That's exactly right! That body double was a coward, after all. I even remember how his hands were trembling when he fired the gun at my balloon. Are we all clear now? I was only there by chance. Just a friendly witness who was passing by.

It happened when I was riding the balloon to the rooftop.

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Around what time was that?
Simon:
I think it was around 11 PM. It should coincidence with the time Ms. Courtney and company were on the roof, right?
Courtney:
...Yes. It was indeed around that time.
Edgeworth:
(There doesn't seem to be any contradictions... However, the time frame is important.)
Simon:
And it was at that moment...
Simon:
I saw the body double and you, Ms. Courtney, on the roof. Talk about a surprise.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you saying this rooftop rendezvous was beyond your expectations?
Simon:
There's no way I could've known about that beforehand. Well, once the dust settled, I could guess what would've happened though. The double had intended to kill Ms. Courtney. Hey, did you realize that?
Courtney:
N-No. I did not... realize it.
Simon:
It's because you were blabbing on and on about that kid.
Courtney:
Th-That's...... I... Uugh...!
Simon:
What kinda mother are you? If things had gone badly, your kid might've died because of you!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I'm your opponent, not her. Don't change the conversation! ...Judge Courtney. I'd like you to please leave this to me.
Courtney:
My apologies, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Oh, Goddess of Law... ...please watch over this man and grant him aid!
Simon:
Hahaha! You're making me laugh. This lady didn't even notice the balloon.
Simon:
Only the double noticed me. He told Ms. Courtney to leave ahead of him.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
He had her leave ahead of him? Didn't you say the body double had planned to kill her?
Simon:
Maybe he thought it would be bad if someone saw the scene of the murder? At the time, no one knew that the president was a fake, right? Once he got the info on John, he'd be able to kill both mother and son whenever he wanted. Thank goodness he's dead! Now you're both safe. You should be happy. Gyaha... hahahahahahah!
Edgeworth:
Whatever emotions you have towards that man, please put them aside until it's all over. For now, please continue your story.
Simon:
Keh heh heh... As you wish. And so, that cowardly body double... ...must have panicked when an eyewitness suddenly appeared from the skies.
Simon:
He then pointed a gun at me and fired.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The bullet struck the balloon's basket cleanly...
Simon:
I panicked and quickly tried to get away so he wouldn't shoot me down, but... ...talk about a close call.
Edgeworth:
You say you tried to get away right then?
Simon:
That's right. Is there a problem?
Edgeworth:
(Is there a problem with his statement?)
There is a problem
Leads to:
"You must have placed Kay on the rooftop."
There is no problem
Edgeworth:
No... there is no problem.
Simon:
I see. In that case, it's fine.
Edgeworth:
You must have placed Kay on the rooftop. You couldn't have gotten away before then, correct?
Simon:
...Yeah. That's right. I forgot. After the body double fired one shot, he entered the hatch to the 51st floor. I looked around for a bit, and then landed on the roof.
Edgeworth:
Please add that statement to your testimony.
Simon:
Sure, I don't mind...
Add statement:
"After the double fired one shot, he entered the hatch to the 51st floor."
Press (after fully pressing this statement)
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Surely, you must have been surprised. So what did you do?
Simon:
What else could I do in that situation? I tried to get away as quickly as I could. But, that body double... He's nothing but a coward hiding behind a steel gun.
Kay:
...Inside his plane at Gourd Lake, he had tons of personal security goods as well.
Edgeworth:
It is said that when a coward is backed into a corner, they can become aggressive.
Simon:
Oh. If that's the case, are you going to get more aggressive now, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Sorry to disappoint, but I try not to become aggressive or defensive. Instead... I attack when I need to be forceful, and defend when a delicate touch is needed. Back to the matter at hand, could you testify about the body double's actions?
Simon:
Hmph... don't be so cold, man.
Simon:
After the double fired one shot, he entered the hatch to the 51st floor.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You mean the hatch that leads to the hidden storeroom for the black market auction?
Kay:
Black market auction... Huh? I don't really want to remember, but... that was 2 days ago, right?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. The black market auction was held on the 50th floor of the Grand Tower.
Kay:
A lot of people must have been coming and going through the storeroom during the incident...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. If the double truly did enter the storeroom as Simon said... ...it's strange that no one noticed him! (The problem here is when this incident occurred... If we know the precise moment, then a certain piece of evidence may come in handy.)
Present Lotta's Testimony
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Once again, you lied."
Edgeworth:
(Eyewitness testimony from the balloon...)
Kay:
So that means, if Simon hadn't come...
Edgeworth:
...Judge Courtney would probably have been in danger.
Kay:
So, wouldn't that mean he saved her life!?
Edgeworth:
The motive behind Mr. Keyes' actions was probably not so noble. After all, this man was there to commit a crime just like the fake president. (To expose his crimes, I'll need to listen carefully to his testimony... There must be an opening somewhere!)
Edgeworth:
Once again, you lied.
Simon:
Lied?
Edgeworth:
The body double could not have entered the storeroom on the 51st floor two nights ago. Ms. Hart's testimony proves it.
Simon:
What!? How can you trust that sham journalist's testimony?
Lotta:
What'd ya say!?
Nicole:
You can't insult my Mentor like that!
Lang:
Two nights ago, that lady was staking out the 51st floor. Given that, just how did that body double leave the roof?
Edgeworth:
...Indeed. That is what we must now prove. (If he did not use the elevator or the 51st floor to leave the roof... ...then only one route remains!) How did the body double leave the roof without using the elevator or the 51st floor?
Present Lion Balloon

Simon:
Yeah. Because your logic is so stupid, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Mmghhoooh! (So it wasn't this...?)
Kay:
If he didn't use the elevator or the secret passage... ...then, he must have scaled the walls!
Edgeworth:
I think only you and a ninja would think of using that kind of escape route.
Kay:
Then, maybe he flew! Zooooom! To the moon!
Edgeworth:
(He flew...?)
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. Just how the heck did that body double get off the roof?
Leads back to:
"How did the body double leave the roof without using the elevator or the 51st floor?"
Edgeworth:
The body double... flew.
Lang:
He...?
Kay:
...flew?
Edgeworth:
Simon Keyes. He rode in your balloon!
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
Hey, hey! Stop joking around! Why would I have needed to give the body double a lift?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The elevator had a security camera. And the 51st floor was being watched by Ms. Hart. Your balloon was the only way the body double could have left the roof!
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
......Heh heh heh heh. ...At the circus, we often perform dangerous stunts, in order to surprise the audience. You think you've got me cornered? Sorry, but... the show ends here.
Edgeworth:
What...?
Simon:
Hey, you. Lotta, was it? I'd like to ask you something... Are you saying you stood watch on the 51st floor the entire time, without any breaks?
Lotta:
W-Well, reckon course! There ain't no mistake in my testimony...
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
Really now? But didn't the sound of Mr. Edgeworth's assistant falling into the storeroom... ...cause you to faint?
Lotta:
I didn't mention it before, but after that I might've dozed off a while. To be more precise... I fainted? Well, somethin' like that.
Edgeworth:
S-So something did happen!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Hart, I have determined the sound that made you faint. It was likely the sound of Kay falling onto the storeroom floor.
Lotta:
Wh-What's yer point!? Nobody's perfect!
Simon:
Heh heh heh. Look at her, Mr. Edgeworth. That's the kind of person you're relying on.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Kay fell into the storeroom after the body double had left the roof!
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
In that case... heh heh heh. I have a theory on how things happened. After that cowardly double fired a shot at me... ...he went and hid in the shadows until Kay fell into the storeroom!
Edgeworth:
What!
Kay:
S-So what if he was hiding!?
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
"Good grief, you guys still haven't noticed?" What if the body double stayed hidden until Lotta had fainted... ...and then he went down to the 51st floor?
Edgeworth:
Th... That can't be...!
Simon:
"Heh... Precisely. The locked room mystery on the roof has been unlocked!"
Edgeworth:
Gah... GWOOOOOOOH! (He even said it in my voice!)
Simon:
Gyaha, Gyaha! Gyahahahah! But wait, there's more... I told the hidden body double about John Marsh. That's why he attacked John the next day during practice, but got himself killed instead. In other words, the one who murdered the body double was none other than John!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
John had no motive to kill the body double!
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
...He knew. He knew he was the real president's son.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. And how would he have known that?
Simon:
Because I told him so. ...In a letter.
Edgeworth:
Wh-What did you say!?
Courtney:
That is a lie!
Simon:
Yup! It's all a lie!
Kay:
Huh?
Simon:
...But then again, maybe not. Maybe I really did tell him? ...Right, John?
John:
It's true that I caused Moozilla's head to fall... ...but... I didn't know about my dad until today!
Simon:
Oh really... I wonder about that. I found out about the head falling thanks to the bug... Now, if you were the one who caused it to fall... and the body double was crushed to death...
John:
Ngh...
Simon:
That settles it. You're the culprit. You successfully carried out your revenge. Congratulations! All the pieces of the puzzle are now in place. As Mr. Edgeworth would say... "...the logic fits. Now then... any rebuttals?"
-- The Murder of the Double --
Simon:
Manipulating humans into fighting with each other. Sounds just like me, right?
I did the same thing to Knightley and Blaise.
At any rate, there's no way the body double could've gone for a ride in my balloon.
The double was crushed by the monster's head, right?
And who was it that caused the monster's head to fall?
Simon:
Do you understand now? Who the body double's real killer is? The "truth" that I provided them with gave them a big motive for murder. Get it? Those two tried to kill each other because of the "truth" you're so fond of!
Edgeworth:
(I... Impossible...!)
Simon:
Hey! You detectives over there! Hurry up and arrest this murderer! What's wrong? Why aren't you moving?
Lang:
D........ Damn!
Simon:
......Heh heh heh. I thought so. Just admit it. In the end, aren't you all the same as Blaise and the body double? You ignore the prime suspect and come after me without any evidence! How easily it can be distorted to best suit your needs, this "law" you all believe in!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
That... is by no means true!
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
Hmph! If you're not gonna arrest anyone, maybe I should have a talk with the policemen outside. If I tell them that John Marsh is the killer, they'll be forced to take action!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Simon Keyes. Your testimony isn't over yet!
Simon:
Heh heh... Really? I figured you'd try to stop me, Mr. Edgeworth. You don't have any evidence, do you? Which means... there's no chance for you to win, right? But if you still plan to stop me, you should be prepared to take on this much risk!
Edgeworth:
Wha...! (Th-That much!?)
Simon:
It's only natural. After all, the fate of the true culprit, John Marsh, is at stake here.
Ray:
.....Hey, Miles? Why don'tcha take a nice deep breath?
Edgeworth:
M-Mr. Shields?
Ray:
At times like this, you should take a breather and think back. "Defense attorneys always remain calm in a pinch, and smile in the face of danger." The point of contention between your logic and his claims lies in the body double's escape route. How's about... for example, we think of it like this... What's important isn't whether or not the body double got on the balloon, but rather... ...if we were to assume he did, "what circumstances would have allowed for that?"
Edgeworth:
(..."Turn my thinking around!")
Ray:
...Well, all I'm doing is a cheap imitation of your old man. Did it help?
Edgeworth:
(Circumstances that would have allowed the body double to get on the balloon...? That's right. The body double not only had a large build,  but he also had a gun. And in spite of that, no traces of sleeping drugs were found in his system... Which means..... it can't be!)
Simon:
Mr. Edgeworth, are you ready yet? Hope you haven't forgotten about "this".

The Lion Balloon...?
Edgeworth:
A monster made of cloth that expands when filled with hot air... It suits you quite well, wouldn't you agree?
Simon:
Sorry, but... I have no idea what you're talking about.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You've been fixated on your claims that you manipulated John and the body double. Probably because it's an impossible fantasy of yours. ...After all, even an animal tamer cannot tame the dead. The body double had already been murdered while he was on the roof... ...and the murder weapon was the balloon you were in!
Simon:
...Ngh!
Lang:
I see. Although it floats in the air, that balloon still weighs several hundred pounds.
Edgeworth:
When the double threatened you on the rooftop... ...you immediately came up with a plan to defend yourself. And that plan was to crush him with your balloon. Whether the body double wanted to get on, or that he was carrying a gun... None of that matters. Because what you carried in your balloon was the body double's corpse!
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
Hold on a second, Mr. Edgeworth. You're saying the double was killed on the rooftop two nights ago? Well, that simply doesn't match up with the time of death!
Edgeworth:
What... did you say?
Simon:
That's not like you at all, Mr. Edgeworth. Take a good look at the autopsy report. The time of death was around 11 PM last night!
Edgeworth:
Nngghhh!
Kay:
L-Last night...!
Simon:
That's right... the very night that Moozilla's head fell!
John:
......!
Simon:
Well, Johnny-boy! Come on! How about telling us the truth! You killed your father, right!? I know the feeling... You hated him, didn't you? Your father who left you all alone forever!
John:
Y-You're wrong! I had no idea that guy was my dad!
Simon:
Not this again. Didn't I personally tell you myself!?
Edgeworth:
(Ngh! Was my logic wrong?)
Simon:
Mr. Edgeworth. Allow me to thank you once again. For chasing down Blaise and Patricia and bringing them both to ruin. My revenge was a success, all thanks to your logic!
Edgeworth:
(If only the time of death matched up, then my logic would fit... Perhaps... he did something to throw off the time of death?)
Simon:
And what's more, Dane Gustavia... was it? You even took down the culprit of the IS-7 Incident.
Edgeworth:
(Dane Gustavia... and the IS-7 Incident...! That's it! Gustavia killed Dover and hid his body in a block of ice...!)
Edgeworth:
...Mr. Gustavia intended to freeze the body in order to throw off the time of death. If the time of death had coincided with the tea party, Mr. Gustavia would have been suspected.
Gustavia:
NWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That is correct.
Simon:
GYAHAHAHAHAHAHA! It's a shame that I didn't get to witness his destruction!
Kay:
H-How can you say that!? Wasn't Mr. Gustavia your father, Simon?
Simon:
............
Simon:
I'm scared... I'm so scared. Ms. Roland keeps asking me about that day. Daddy, help me...! Why won't you come save me? Is it... because I broke my promise with you and didn't eat your sweets......?
Simon:
I couldn't care less. My father left me all alone. Even if we share the same blood, that man is not my father!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I hate to say it, but... Like father, like son. You're the spitting image of him, Simon. The father you hated so much...
Simon:
Huh? What are you talking about?
Edgeworth:
It must have been fate... By sheer coincidence, you just happened to use the exact same method your father did... ...to throw off the victim's time of death!
Gumshoe:
And we rescued him from the refrigerated warehouse near the harbor, pal!
Lang:
A refrigerated warehouse?
Simon:
You're saying that I threw off the time of death? H-How would I have done that?
Edgeworth:
The answer lies in where you hid the body double's body! This was the place you used to hide the body!
Present Sunshine Warehouse
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Throwing off the time of death by freezing the body, along with John's kidnapping."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is where you hid the body!
Simon:
Oh? I hid the body in a place like that?
Edgeworth:
It's useless to play dumb, Simon Keyes!
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. Sorry to interrupt while you're all fired up, but... ...that place couldn't have thrown off the time of death!
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (Indeed, it can't be this place...)
Lang:
You say he threw off the time of death? Lang Zi says: "To preserve freshness, store items in a cold place!" If he wanted to preserve the body in the state it was after the murder... ...doesn't that limit the number of places where he could've stored it?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. And we must consider the places that Simon would have access to.
Leads back to:
"This was the place you used to hide the body!"
Edgeworth:
Throwing off the time of death by freezing the body, along with John's kidnapping. Hmph... it seems that everything is coming together.
Simon:
The kidnapping? Why are we going back to that? ...I don't know a thing about it.
Edgeworth:
Don't forget. John was confined in a refrigerated warehouse. That's right... you kept the body double's corpse in that very same warehouse! 18 years ago, your father hid a body in the same way!
Simon:
W... What? My father... the one who abandoned me, did the same thing?
Edgeworth:
Who would've gussed... that both father and son would use the same method.
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
Stop it! Don't lump me in with that guy! My father... I'm nothing like him! There's not a single connection between us!
Ray:
Objection!
Ray:
You may think so, but even now, your bond with Mr. Gustavia still remains. Didn't you say once before, "I don't like sweets"? That... may have come from the shock of losing your father, don't you think?
Simon:
Ngh...! You guys have no idea what you're saying...!
Edgeworth:
Even if you deny your father, aren't your thoughts and actions the same? Particularly, your belief of "sacrificing others to protect yourself". And finally... your crimes were brought to light, just as his were!
Simon:
Uuh... UUuuungh........ Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa .....Just kidding. Ahahahaha! I don't know anything about that warehouse. I had nothing to do with the kidnapping, after all.
Edgeworth:
In order to threaten Judge Courtney... it's clear that you partook in the kidnapping!
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
How scary. Those who get involved with you will be charged with all sorts of crimes. In the end, there's no evidence. For the instigation, and for the kidnapping. None at all. Or what? Are you gonna forge some evidence? Just like Blaise and the rest?
Edgeworth:
Ngh! I-I'll do nothing of the sort! (I-I can't let him provoke me...)
Simon:
You always say, "I'll pursue the truth, no matter what," right? Hah! Don't you mean only the "truth" that's most convenient to you? After all, that's how the police pull the wool over the eyes of those without power! And that's why my revenge was necessary! Gayha, Gyahahaha! None of you can catch me! Not Patricia! Not Blaise! .....And not even you!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, at this rate...! Isn't there something, anything, we can do?
Edgeworth:
(Even though all my logic points to this man... ...I just need evidence... even a single piece of evidence would suffice!)
Simon:
...Well. It's been a fun show, but it looks like it's time for the curtains to close. If you'd like, why don't you come and see my next performance? I'll let you, if you admit defeat. ...Gyaha, gyaha, Gyahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Hold it!
Simon:
...Wh-Who was that!?
Gumshoe:
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Edgeworth!
Kay:
Gummy! Where'd you go?
Gumshoe:
I was just doing the job that I'm able to do, pal!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe...! Your report, please.
Gumshoe:
I did a quick investigation, sir! About the warehouse John was at!
Simon:
......!
Gumshoe:
That refrigerated warehouse is currently being rented by... ...the Berry Big Circus, just as Mr. Edgeworth said!
Lang:
Hahaha! So it's finally here... Our trump card!
Edgeworth:
Well done, Detective Gumshoe. .....Now then, Mr. Keyes?
Simon:
Hmph. There must be some mistake. Maybe it has something to do with the circus?
Edgeworth:
I see. Indeed, we are not well informed with the affairs of the circus. In that case, why don't we get your boss' opinion on this? ...Regina.
Simon:
Ngh.....!
Regina:
We are renting a refrigerated warehouse to store the animal's food, but... ...I don't know much about the place. After all... I let Simon handle everything.
Simon:
Nnngh! C-Curse yooouuuu!
Regina:
Kyaaaah! S-Simon... how scary!
Edgeworth:
What a shame... It seems your desperate actions after the crime were in vain. If the body was found in the warehouse, suspicion would've fallen on you, the one in charge. That's why you specifically moved the body back to the Grand Tower, wasn't it?
Simon:
Ngh!
Edgeworth:
However, us finding John confined at the warehouse was a fatal mistake on your part. Our resident Great Thief and Detective are both rather exemplary. What's wrong? I can even tell through your face paint that you're looking pale.
Simon:
Keh heh heh... Ahahahaha! It's not over yet, Mr. Edgeworth. Your logic is missing the most important piece of evidence.
Edgeworth:
Oh? Please do tell.
Simon:
Isn't that obvious!? Evidence that I killed the body double with the balloon! You can't present it, can you? After all, there's no way such evidence could possibly exist!
Edgeworth:
The evidence..... it exists.
Simon:
What'd you say!?
Edgeworth:
(If Mr. Keyes murdered the victim...) Traces of the murder should still remain here!
Present Lion Balloon
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It should become clear once we examine the basket of this balloon."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Care to look at this piece of evidence? Traces of the murder still remain on it.
Simon:
I honestly have no clue why you'd show me that. Mr. Edgeworth. You're a genius prosecutor, aren't you? Do you really think such a thing could be evidence?
Edgeworth:
Uoooh! (So he saw through me...?)
Kay:
Simon killed the double with the balloon, right? In that case...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. If traces of the murder remain, it must be there!
Simon:
What's wrong, Mr Edgeworth? Don't have any evidence after all?
Edgeworth:
No. Traces of the murder clearly remain! Simon Keyes! I'll show them to you right now!
Leads back to:
"Traces of the murder should still remain here!"
Edgeworth:
It should become clear once we examine the basket of this balloon.
Simon:
Gyahaha! The balloon again? Didn't you already find the bullet hole? There's no way you'll find anything else there!
Kay:
That's... I-It'll be fine! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!? Mr. Edgeworth is a hero who always finds the truth no matter what he's up against!
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! Of course it's gonna be fine! Mr. Edgeworth has gotten out of more impossible situations than I can count!
Ray:
Miles, I believe in you too. But more importantly... I'm sure your old man watching over you believes in you as well.
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth. Calm down and think. You're just one step away from the perfect proof!
Edgeworth:
The body double was killed by this balloon. The proof lies in the traces left on the basket. ...Simon Keyes. It's time for you to atone for your crimes.
Lang:
...I'll see it with my own eyes. The moment this past case is settled once and for all!
Courtney:
Please... Prosecutor Edgeworth. Deliver the final blow to this unforgivable person!
Edgeworth:
This is the final piece of evidence that proves your crimes! (What traces were left on the balloon that crushed the victim?)
Present Bouquet
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"When John found the body..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Simon Keyes! This proves...
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
Gyahahahaha! Mr. Edgeworth. Your final move is pathetic! Did you really think you could corner me with that? There's no way that was left on the balloon!
Edgeworth:
Argh! (So it wasn't this...?)
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. This isn't like you!
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! Calm down and think it over!
Kay:
We're almost there, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's present Simon with the decisive evidence!
Edgeworth:
(If any traces remain, they might not only be left on the balloon. So, I'll also have to consider if anything else was stained.) Simon Keyes! This is the final piece of evidence that proves your crimes!
Leads back to:
"(What traces were left on the balloon that crushed the victim?)"
Edgeworth:
When John found the body... ...a bouquet of Lion Lilies was there as well.
Lang:
Lion Lilies? The flowers from Zheng Fa that represent the bond between parent and child...?
Simon:
That's your evidence? Surely, they must be buried under a mountain of garbage by now. Moreover, the one who threw it away was John himself. That's not much of a bond now, is it?
John:
Grrr... That language of flowers stuff has nothing to do with this!
Edgeworth:
Calm down, John. Certainly, you may have thrown the flowers away. However, I believe those emotions remain as strong as ever. Those bonds will surely protect you from that man, in the form of my final piece of evidence...
Simon:
What..... the heck are you talking about?
Edgeworth:
Those flowers were crushed... Ergo, they must have come into contact with the murder weapon! Perhaps we'll find the very same pollen still stuck to the basket of your balloon?
Simon:
Nowaynowaynoway! You guys examined the basket just a few moments ago. If there had been any yellow pollen stuck on there, wouldn't you have noticed it then?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...Mr. Keyes. Evidence is not restricted to what you can see with the naked eye.
Simon:
What...?
Edgeworth:
Ema!
Ema:
Yes!
Edgeworth:
Would you perform one more scientific investigation for us?
Ema:
Leave it to me! The balloon's basket, right!? Ah! A reaction! This is clearly pollen from a yellow flower! We'll find out soon enough whether or not it's from the same flower!
Simon:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAT!?
Edgeworth:
I'd say this proves that... ...the body double's death was caused directly by your own hand!
Simon:
No way! That's...! That can't be! I...!
Edgeworth:
You crushed the body double to death on the roof of the tower! Then, you retrieved the body and hid it in the warehouse.
Lang:
Why... did he have to go to the trouble of retrieving the body?
Edgeworth:
Two nights ago, he knew, that a separate incident would occur at the tower.
Kay:
Ah! Ms. Crane's...!
Edgeworth:
Precisely. Leaving the body there would have disrupted his plans.
Lang:
I see. But even so, he couldn't leave the body in the circus warehouse either.
Edgeworth:
Exactly. So the next day, when he was bringing the body back to the tower once again... ...he saw the small fire John started, which caused the Moozilla's head to fall! Was that when the idea came to you? Your plan to pin the crime on John.
Simon:
Gaaaaah...!
Courtney:
You made it look like the murder weapon was the fallen head. Such foul, cowardly behavior...!
Edgeworth:
For that reason, you carried the double's body in the balloon and lowered it into the film lot. At that time, the figure of the body double being lowered down by a rope... ...was captured in John's video recording!
Simon:
D-Damn... I-It was all... You saw through it all!? Damn it... DAMN YOUUU!
Edgeworth:
You manipulated animals, you manipulated people, and you manipulated cases... ...almost as if you were a king. However, it's now all come to an end...
Regina:
Simon. The animals have gotten angry. Even Money and Astique. You never thought of them as your friends at all... How sad.
Simon:
D-Damn it! Don't you look at me with those eyes!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. It's about time you went back to being a mere clown. A fitting end to your... pitiful jester's act.
Simon:
U... Uwah... S-Stay away! Get away from meeeeeee! Stop it! Please stop it...!
Simon:
"Daddy...! Help me! I'm scared... I'm so scared...!"
Simon:
I don't know anything! I didn't do anything bad! They were the bad ones, weren't they!?
Simon:
"Horace... Why? Why did you stop me...?"
Simon:
If he hadn't done that, I......! I couldn't even trust the police! Nobody would help me!
Simon:
"But that man...! Back then, he saved me...!"
Simon:
The only one who helped me was Dogen! So, I used everyone else! What's wrong with that!? S-Stop it! Don't come any closer! STOOOOOOOOOOOOP! OWIE! OWIE! OWIE! AIIIEEEE! HYAAARGH! U... Uuugh... N-Not you...! UGHYAAAHIIIIIII! HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA P-Please..... NO MOOOOOOOOORE!
???:
It seems the game is finally over.
Edgeworth:
Shelly de Killer!
de Killer:
Mr. Edgeworth. I must thank you. You have exposed the true identity of the mastermind. Now... I am free to...
Edgeworth:
What!?
de Killer:
...Drawing a gun would be most inadvisable. Stay where you are and do not move.
Simon:
Ngh... I-I don't have a gun...
de Killer:
You do have a gun, do you not? You intended to draw and fire it without anyone noticing.
Edgeworth:
(He must have taken it from the body double when he killed him...)
de Killer:
This man has betrayed his bond of trust with me. He would have me kill the president, while knowing full well he was the body double. Lying about a target is an extremely dangerous thing to do to an assassin. Not having all the cards on the table can seriously jeopardize an assassination.
Simon:
Uuggghh!
de Killer:
However, what is even more unforgivable... ...is your deception and your attempt to manipulate me. The time has come... for your retribution.
Edgeworth:
Stop!
de Killer:
Y-You are...!
Dogen:
It has been far too long, Shelly.
de Killer:
Please step aside. That man is my prey.
Dogen:
I must ask you to spare his life. Please permit this young acolyte to receive his proper punishment in prison.
de Killer:
........
Simon:
........
de Killer:
And if I refuse?
Dogen:
His is the first life I have ever saved... I will not allow it to be taken away so easily.
de Killer:
You saved a life...? The assassin, Sirhan Dogen?
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. Ironic, is it not? That I, the one who has taken countless lives, am making a plea for this young one's life. He saved my life, just as I have saved his. Before I knew it, I grew quite fond of the lad. You may laugh at me as much as you wish. However... I must ask that you spare the life of the boy. From one assassin to another... Please make this allowance.
de Killer:
........ ...I understand. If you are willing to go that far...
Dogen:
You have my thanks. I am in your debt.
de Killer:
......No need for thanks. I simply felt there would be no merit in a fight to the death with you. That is all. And with that, I must take my leave.
Lang:
Damn it! Wait!
Dogen:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I must thank you as well. It was necessary for this young acolyte to be put in his place. And that, you have done. ......Now then, it's time for me to return. To my humble cage, surrounded by iron bars. Right, Anubis? Right, boy?
Hold it!
Dogen:
......Oh? Look who's here...
John:
...Hey, priest guy. You killed my dad, right?
Dogen:
...Indeed. I am not one to forget those I have slain. Keh heh heh... I see. You must despise me, boy with horns. In that case...
John:
.....Ugh!
Courtney:
J-John!
Dogen:
Do not panic. I simply lent the boy with horns my knife. Take that knife... And run it through my throat! A single stab should do it. I've long grown weary of my wooden carvings. Keh heh heh.
John:
.......Revenge...
Kay:
J-John! Don't do it!
Courtney:
John... Please, I beg of you!
John:
...Until just now, I had intended to seek revenge... no matter how many years it took.
Simon:
Revenge...? Revenge is good, really good. ...All your pain and suffering slips away. Everything becomes numb, and you'll feel nothing.
John:
Yeah, you may be right. I thought about that while I listened to what you had to say.
Edgeworth:
...John!
John:
But, the only one who would be satisfied with revenge would be myself, right? If I became a murderer, my mom would go through even more pain and suffering. My friends from the movie too, and all those people who care about me as well...
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. The boy with horns... says some interesting things.
John:
That's right. I finally get it now. I'll never forgive you, but... I'm not the one who should punish you. After all, isn't that what my mom... and that prosecutor guy are here for?
Courtney:
John...!
Kay:
John... you just said some really profound stuff just now!
Edgeworth:
(Kay, perhaps you should study up a little more yourself...)
Dogen:
Is that so? ...Well then, young one. It is time for us to depart.
Simon:
Wh-Where to?
Dogen:
To prison, of course. That place will be our home.
Simon:
Our home...?
Edgeworth:
And with that... the case that involved and affected so many people came to a close. However, there was still one last thing I had to do...
April 8, 2:54 PMGrand TowerP.I.C. Meeting Room
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Sorry to keep you waiting!
Ray:
Why'd you call Uncle Ray and the rest of us out here?
Edgeworth:
..........
Courtney:
Mr. Edgeworth. The formal proceedings have just come to a close.
Ray:
Hm? What are you talking about?
Edgeworth:
This is the place where I once relinquished my prosecutor's badge.
Courtney:
! This is... your prosecutor's badge! Prosecutor Edgeworth! What is the meaning of this!?
Edgeworth:
...Consider this my resignation. I am... no longer a prosecutor!
Kay:
In order to save me when I was suffering from memory loss, you...
Edgeworth:
......A certain man once said... ...the only ally a defendant has is their attorney. By trusting in their client, an attorney draws closer to the truth... The sight of that man still shines brilliantly in my eyes... ...just as the image of my father fighting in court does.
Ray:
...Gregory...
Edgeworth:
However, this is nothing more than that man and my father's way of life. ......It is not mine.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
I think I shall live as a prosecutor after all.
Ray:
.........I see. So, you've made your decision.
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry...
Ray:
No, no, I understand... That's your answer, isn't it?
Edgeworth:
It is.
Ray:
OK! Then that's the end of this conversation! Don't regret it. Even if you beg me later, I won't let you work for me ever again!
Edgeworth:
I-I understand.
Ray:
But you know, Miles... Mind if I ask why you chose to live as a prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
.......... Mr. Shields. You asked me this before...
Ray:
To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. I want you to think carefully, about how you want to live your life from now on.
Edgeworth:
I've thought long and hard about that question ever since. How should I live my life...? ...And after this case concluded, I finally found my answer. I want to save people as a prosecutor.
Ray:
As a prosecutor...?
Edgeworth:
Simon Keyes... He, too, was a victim. He lost a parent in a past murder, and with it, the ability to believe in anything else. (I, too, know that feeling... The feeling of losing what's important to you and being unable to believe in anything. I doubted everything during my lonely battles in those days.)
Edgeworth:
All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared "guilty"!
Edgeworth:
(The one who saved me was...)
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes must have been all alone... Unable to find salvation from the law, he had no choice but to turn his hand to revenge.
Edgeworth:
And I suppose you never thought to seek help from the police.
Simon:
Nowaynoway! As long as Blaise was around, any evidence would be destroyed by him. Actually, didn't something like that almost happen today during Patricia's trial?
Edgeworth:
I want to save those like Simon Keyes.
Ray:
So, how would you save him?
Edgeworth:
I'm sure this tragedy could have been avoided if only he could have relied on the courts.
Courtney:
But instead, he was cornered by Blaise Debeste, who used the power of law for evil. The form of the law can change depending on who wields it. It can be at once a shield to protect... and a blade to harm. That, too, is a contradiction of the law...
Ray:
A contradiction, huh...
Ray:
That's true... It sure is a contradiction in the law. The way the law is right now... it isn't always completely right.
Edgeworth:
The only way to right those contradictions is by joining in the court system... The one who could save Simon Keyes was not an attorney... ...but rather a watchman of the law: a prosecutor. I shall face the contradictions in the law as a prosecutor.
Ray:
.......... I see. That's just like you. But you know... It'll be tough. It won't be just a walk in the park. You'll be going up against the law itself... You do realize that, right?
Edgeworth:
I do. However, someone must.
Ray:
.....Yup, yup. Uncle Ray believes in you too. The law evolves and grows, just like all of us do. I'm sure you can pull it off. After all, you're Gregory's son. Your old man would never give up, no matter what. His eyes always saw only what laid straight ahead. Miles... When you chose to live as a prosecutor, your eyes looked just like your father's. It looks like you've grown a bit. I really wish your old man could see you now...
Edgeworth:
Thank you very much, Mr. Shields.
Courtney:
...So then, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Allow me to formally return this to you.
Edgeworth:
Please do.
Courtney:
I, Justine Courtney, as a member of the P.I.C, do hereby return to Miles Edgeworth... ...the rights and privileges of a prosecutor, in the name of the Goddess of Law...!
Prosecutor's Badge data jotted down in my Organizer.
Kay:
And with that, Prosecutor Edgeworth is revived!
Examine evidence
Front side of Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.
Back side of Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!
Gumshoe:
That's great, sir!
Ray:
So then, Prosecutor Edgeworth, it's time for Uncle Ray to make his exit. I have to report to your old man all about the traitor in the Edgeworth family.
Edgeworth:
...Thank you for everything, truly.
Ray:
The next time we meet just might be in the courtroom. I hope you'll be ready. ...Uncle Ray might not look it, but he's an ace attorney, after all.
Edgeworth:
I'll look forward to seeing the attorney my father trained in action.
Ray:
Take care!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth... Welcome back.
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. I must give my thanks to you as well.
Courtney:
To me?
Edgeworth:
You sought to fix the corruption within the P.I.C. from the inside. That must truly have been a lonely battle.
Courtney:
No, it was not... for I was never alone.
Kay:
Because the Goddess of Law is always by your side, right!?
Edgeworth:
You made me realize that one could fight in such a way. The Prosecutor's Office, no, the entire legal world is caught up in this contradiction. If that cannot be set right, there is a truth that will never see the light of day... It was only through your help that I was able to find this new path. One that fights against the contradictions in the law.
Courtney:
I, too, find that promising, as one in the service of the Goddess of Law. You shall certainly succeed in helping the law grow.
Edgeworth:
Let us meet again in the courtroom.
Courtney:
Yes. I must apologize for my shameful acts during the trial two days ago... Next time, I shall fulfill my duties as a judge perfectly.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor...... I do not intend to speak regarding your ideals.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
However, the greatest judge I know... ...is one overflowing with humanity. Even during a trial, that judge experiences happiness, anger, sadness, and joy... ...but nevertheless, always hands down the correct verdict in the end.
Courtney:
........
Edgeworth:
It's difficult to say... ...but sometimes, I feel that... ...perfection is not always correct.
Courtney:
So, a judge, too has the right to behave in such a manner... ...Thank you very much. ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. When I pursued and fought against Blaise Debeste... ...the Goddess of Law was not the only one by my side.
Kay:
Ah! It's John!
Courtney:
When I have this cutout with me, I feel a strange sense of courage well up from within. No matter how painful things became, no matter how strong the foe... ...when I remember that I am not alone, I'm able to keep moving forward. Wrongs must be put right. For John's sake, as well...
Edgeworth:
(John, too, lost his father in a past crime...)
Courtney:
That is more important to me than even the words of the Goddess of Law. Ha ha. Though I'm sure the Goddess would be angered by those words.
Edgeworth:
Heh. Your bond with your son is the secret to your strength, I imagine.
Courtney:
I don't have to be perfect, I just want to grow little by little. Both as a judge, and as a mother. ...That is how I feel.
Edgeworth:
Heh. It seems there is much each of us has yet to learn.
Courtney:
Agreed. We are still but children before the world. Let us grow in our respective paths, until we meet again. I shall look forward to that reunion... May the blessings of the Goddess of Law be upon you as you follow your new path!
Edgeworth:
Though I once lost my position as Prosecutor, I have now reclaimed it... ...so that I may tread a new path as a prosecutor. I shall surely reach the truth waiting at the end of this path. No matter how difficult the path may be... ...if any seek to stop me on my path, they shall receive no mercy. No matter who they may be, I will shout just one word.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Nicole:
...Chief! What sorta scoop are ya aimin' for next?
Lotta:
Hey... Ain't you a journalist? There ain't nothin' more important than information. You may be my apprentice, but yer still my business rival. I ain't gonna tell ya everythin'.
Nicole:
Th-That's my Mentor alright... I reckon yer even more prepared than me. I understand! I'll get my information using my own two feet!
Lotta:
Yeah! That's the spirit! By the way... Would ya mind me askin' what sorts scoop yer aimin' for next?
Nicole:
...Huh? Ch-Chief?
Lotta:
Ain't no need to be stingy... I'm yer mentor, after all.
Nicole:
Th-That's just heinous...
de Killer:
It seems... that the wound on my left arm has yet to heal. The bodyguard who inflicted this wound upon me... His is a name I will never forget. Now then... Shall I return to being a simple ice cream salesman? Perhaps this time I should try being a crepe salesman instead. For now, I shall live a calm life. ...Until my services are required once more.
Elbird:
I mighta been knocked out once by that prosecutor named Edgeworth... ...but I'll keep on trying to escape. I won't let him dampen my fighting spirit. Ain't that right, Rocky? The gong that'll sound off my next escape will ring out soon enough. Until then, let's keep working out.
Sahwit:
Are you inquiring into my studies to become a pet groomer? I am working as hard as ever. I spend every day covered in mud... Perhaps this suits my true nature far better than the life of a newspaper salesman. Once I leave the prison, I hope to earn an honest wage as a pet trimmer. ...Huh? My sentence has been extended? Because I was Warden Roland's accomplice? Oo... ooo... oooh. UOOOOOOOOH! Why do you think I've been giving a rat's ass about these stupid animals' well being!? To hell with the pet trimmer's license! Daaammiiiiiiiiit!
Regina:
Regina was really shocked by the truth about Simon too... I mean, I trusted him as my subordinate... But there's no use fretting over it. The show must go on. I have to do my best so that I won't lose to the magic or ventriloquist divisions! I'll put on the greatest performance ever! One that'll blow away this entire case!
Dogen:
It seems I have grown soft in my old age. Right, Anubis? Right, boy? To think the life I saved on a whim 18 years ago would drive me to such lengths. Thanks to that, I am confined to my humble cell once more. Well... This time, that child is here as well. Perhaps it won't be such a bore. Right, boy?
Master:
♬ Today's desseeert is chooocolate caaake!
Kate:
♪ Thaaat geeently meeelting moment of alluuure!
Master:
I will wait for you forever, Kate. I shall come here every day just as you and Raymond did for me.
Kate:
Monsieur Shields, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I am truly grateful to them. I cannot believe I am able to eat your desserts once more, Monsieur Master!
Master:
Ho ho... I have been allowed to distribute my treats in both the detention center and the prison. For the past 18 years, I have brought joy to one and all with my delicious sweets!
Delicia:
Yessie! Thanks for everything, boys! Of course... I owe Greggy my thanks too! After all, I get to stuff myself with Jeffy's delicious desserts once again! Oi! Next time, maybe I'll use one of Jeffy's sweets to create a new drug. "The Tuck in Diet"... You'll tuck in your stomach while you tuck into desserts! It'll be delicious and slimming, and also good for your health!
Larry:
Man! I'm glad I got to meet and sketch so many beauties! ...But, Mandy caught a glimpse of my beauties sketch. She had a misunderstanding, and clobbered me in the face with my sketchbook. So in exchange for my sketch of beauties, I had one beauty walk out on me. Maybe it's time for me to start getting more serious about my life. Do I take the path of an artist, or do I follow the path of my heart...? Oh, and by "heart" I mean the heart of my new lady!
Ray:
Mr. Badd. Thanks for all your help today.
Badd:
Hmph... I'll testify about the IS-7 Incident as much as you need me to... ...Prosecutor Edgeworth... seems pretty active too.
Ray:
He chose not to take the same path as Gregory, but rather, to live as a prosecutor. Well, I am kinda sad that I won't get to work with him, but I'll continue to watch over him.
Badd:
Heh... It looks like you've grown up quite a bit yourself.
Ray:
He he heh. I'm so happy. Mr. Badd actually praised me! If you ever need a hand from attorney Raymond Shields, give me a call, any time, any place!
Karin:
My crimes were punished far more leniently than I expected. Once it was proven that I had been threatened... Ouch! "No crime is more heavy or light than any other"...? I'm sorry. Of course I regret what I did. However... I'm so glad I can still be together with you, Granny. Huh? You want to hurry back to work? Ha ha. That's right. The next corpse is waiting for us, after all!
Ema:
I'm glad that my scientific investigation came in handy this time around as well. Good thing I rushed back here all the way from Europe! And now... I have to leave again. That kinda takes the fire out of a girl, as you can imagine. Aha ha... But, this is all so that I can become an actual forensic scientist! ...So then, I guess it's time to go. Ah. If anything comes up, be sure to call me right away! The second I get the word, I'll dash right over!
Franziska:
The greater the father, the greater the expectations are for their children. Prosecutor Debeste... was it? His way of life shall be tested henceforth... ...just as mine was. Miles Edgeworth chose to live a different life from his father, as a prosecutor. I suppose... That, too, is an answer.
Lang:
I could never have imagined... the truth that my old man was hiding. Unlike me, who only thought about the Lang clan... ...my old man was trying to protect an entire nation. But I swear to you all that I will carry on his will. Even if the president was a fake, and the real one was murdered... ...I swear that I, together with my men, shall revive Zheng Fa! Someday, I will surely show you all a Zheng Fa brimming with life.
Debeste:
I've asked everyone to stop calling me "The Best". ...I don't like it. It makes me feel like I'm just borrowing Pops' power. I shall study even harder than before and triumph over Pops! I'll become strong enough so that I won't lose even to Mr. Edgeworth! Now then! Let's start by thinking up my new nickname!
Powers:
A lot has happened, but thankfully, the film was a roaring success.
Penny:
The gossip articles about the murder made our movie the talk of the country. "A Monstrous Man Appears from the Mighty Moozilla! This Is the True Face of the Monster Who Murdered the President of Zheng Fa!" ...Huh? Isn't that you in the photo, Mr. Powers?
Powers:
Huh!? How could something like this happen!?
Penny:
Now, now, it's fine, isn't it? It's thanks to those articles that our film is a big hit.
Powers:
*sigh*... M-Much obliged.
Courtney:
John. I greatly enjoyed watching your movie.
John:
...I-It's no big deal. It's not like I had a major role or anything.
Courtney:
What are you saying!? You played the key character who connects Moozilla and Gourdy! There is no one else besides you who could have played the part!
John:
...Y-Yeah, I guess. Well, it would be nice if there's a sequel. I really enjoy working as an actor. ...Mom, before we head home, can we go buy something? I'd like to decorate our home with a Lion Lily, for dad.
Courtney:
Then, one will not suffice. You will need two more: one for me... and one for Amy.
April 8, 4:17 PMHigh Prosecutors' OfficesRoom 1202
Gumshoe:
Wow! We were really busy with all those cases, weren't we, sir!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed, we were. Why did all these incidents happen in such quick succession?
Kay:
I feel like things are always busy whenever I'm around!
Gumshoe:
Wait, Kay, wouldn't that mean you're a magnet for crimes...?
Kay:
Hey! Gummy, that was rude.
Edgeworth:
(I do get the impression that he's not entirely wrong...) So then, Kay, do you intend to resume your training to become a Great Thief?
Kay:
Hmm. I dunno...
Gumshoe:
Huh? Is something on your mind, pal?
Kay:
How should I put it...? Until now, I've always been chasing after my father... ...so that I could become a Great Thief, just like him!
Edgeworth:
(Like the previous Yatagarasu, I suppose...)
Kay:
But... watching you, Mr. Edgeworth, made me think. Maybe, instead of chasing after my father, I should find my own path. ...I mean, you didn't become a defense attorney either.
Edgeworth:
(Chasing after a parent's shadow isn't the only path in life for a child, after all...)
Kay:
I'm going to aim to be a hero in my own way!
Edgeworth:
...That sounds good.
Kay:
But of course, that doesn't mean I'm gonna throw away the name of the Great Thief Yatagarasu!
Gumshoe:
No matter what sort of hero you become, Kay will always still be Kay!
Kay:
Thanks, Gummy! And Gummy will always be Gummy!
Gumshoe:
Of course, pal. I plan to keep pushing forward on my path of a detective, after all! Mr. Edgeworth! I look forward to continuing to work with you, sir!
Edgeworth:
Yes. I'll be counting on you, Detective Gumshoe. Detective, you saved me many times during these past cases. ...You have my gratitude. I suggest you look forward to your next salary assessment.
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Kay:
Whaaaat!?
Gumshoe:
......D-Does that mean... what I think it means...!?
Edgeworth:
What's wrong? I am saying that your salary ought to be raised.
Gumshoe:
R-Really, sir!? I can't believe it!
Kay:
Isn't that great, Gummy!?
Gumshoe:
It's like a dream come true! I can finally say goodbye to my instant noodle lifestyle!
Edgeworth:
However, that doesn't mean you can start slacking off. The real work begins from here on out. ...You should prepare yourself.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! Roger that! I'll devote my body and soul to following after you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
The path Mr. Shields and Judge Courtney taught me... ...is to take a stand against the contradiction in the law... ...and to reach the truth at the end of that road. (What am I able to do? That is a question I must continue to dwell upon. Certainly, this path will not be easy. However...)
Courtney:
...Prosecutor Edgeworth. When I pursued and fought against Blaise Debeste... ...the Goddess of Law was not the only one by my side.
Kay:
Ah! It's John!
Courtney:
When I have this cutout with me, I feel a strange sense of courage well up from within. When I remember that I am not alone, I'm able to keep moving forward.
Edgeworth:
Heh. Your bond with your son is the secret to your strength, I imagine.
Edgeworth:
(Bonds... huh.)
Kay:
Ahh! I completely forgot!
Edgeworth:
Th-That was sudden. What's wrong?
Kay:
I was searching for members for the new Yatagarasu team!
Edgeworth:
(Now that you mention it, I do remember you saying something to that effect...)
Kay:
But in the end, I wasn't even able to find a single person. Can you imagine it? A team, combining their powers, in order to steal the truth! I wanted to create an invincible team like that, but...
Gumshoe:
What are you saying, pal!? Don't you already have a team!? Together, the three of us can solve any case that comes our way!
Kay:
Yeah! You're right! A prosecutor, a detective, and a Great Thief! We're the invincible trio of heroes that steals, captures, and pursues the truth!
Edgeworth:
(Hearing all that kind of makes me feel sorry for the truth...)
Gumshoe:
As long as the three of us are together, there's nothing to fear! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Yes, you are correct...
Edgeworth:
Even until his last moments, my father ran along his own path. I, too, shall advance along mine... ...accompanied by my somewhat boisterous comrades. As long as they are by my side, I can walk forward without hesitation... ...on this new path as a prosecutor. Prosecutors and attorneys... The path I walk is not my father's. However, I am certain that the two paths are not separate. Though we may walk in opposite directions, our destination is the same. Why, you may ask...? Because both paths lead to the one and only Truth.
THE END
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right... I need to reconsider the information.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information. I need to think this over one more time.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (John Marsh)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
John. Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
John:
...No.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Do you think your selfishness will pass by unchallenged?
John:
...It's not selfishness. Just one glance at that piece of evidence told me it was useless...
Edgeworth:
Argh! (So this wasn't it...?)
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. Doesn't it look like this pup's making fun of you?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. In that case, I just need to present evidence that he can't make fun of.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (John Marsh)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
John. Your statement is clearly incorrect.
John:
*glug, glug, glug, glug* ...Ahhh!
Edgeworth:
Don't just drink milk! Haven't you been taught to drink milk and listen to others at the same time?
John:
...What's that, old man? Were you talking to me?
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (He wasn't even listening?)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. John's making a fool of you, isn't he?
Edgeworth:
It seems it will be necessary to teach him the harshness of the real world. I must silence him with evidence so he can't make any more of these cheeky remarks.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (John Marsh)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
John. Your testimony contradicts this piece of evidence.
John:
........
Edgeworth:
It appears you have been humiliated beyond words.
John:
...Old man. I don't even get what you're trying to say!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (So I'm the one who's being humiliated...!)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. Why are you getting all riled up when your opponent is just a child!?
Edgeworth:
I'm not getting riled up. However... for John, a bit of punishment is in order.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... Just don't go overboard, OK...?
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Shi-Long Lang)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, that statement contradicts this piece of evidence!
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor, are you playing games with me?
Edgeworth:
The evidence says it all.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
In that case, the evidence is lying through its teeth!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (So that wasn't it...)
Kay:
Even if you defang him, he's still a wolf! As expected, he's tough.
Edgeworth:
Yes. He's a worthy opponent indeed.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Shi-Long Lang)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. Please take a look at this piece of evidence.
Lang:
Hah! Just what are you trying to say with that evidence!?
Edgeworth:
If you don't even know after looking at it, you certainly have fallen to a new low.
Lang:
Brazenly shoving such a meaningless thing into my face... Aren't you the one who has fallen to a new low here!?
Edgeworth:
Urgh! (So it wasn't this piece of evidence...)
Kay:
What are you doing!? You realize who you're up against, right!? If you're not careful, you're gonna get bitten!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. I'd better be wary of those fangs.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Shi-Long Lang)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, it seems there is a clear contradiction in your statement.
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "Always question words without evidence!" Hah! But it seems I don't even need to question the words that you're saying. It's clearly a pathetic bluff!
Edgeworth:
Argh! (So that was wrong?)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! A bluff won't be effective against Mr. Lang!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. In that case, I'll have to face him head-on!
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Sirhan Dogen)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Dogen, what do you think of this piece of evidence?
Dogen:
Ask as you will, I am still lacking in sight. However... ...if one would like to retract that, now would be the proper time to do so, wouldn't you think?
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (Is he trying to say I was wrong?)
Dogen:
Although, if one were to retract it, perhaps one should not have brought it out to begin with. Right, Anubis? Right, boy?
Lang:
That old man really doesn't miss a beat, does he?
Edgeworth:
(I was overwhelmed and put the evidence back into my Organizer... I should probably think things over a little more carefully.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Sirhan Dogen)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Dogen! There is a clear contradiction in your testimony!
Dogen:
There is no need to raise your voice. I can hear the good prosecutor perfectly well. Talking so loud only makes it harder to conceal your mistakes.
Edgeworth:
...Argh! (I guess that was his roundabout way of saying I was wrong!)
Gumshoe:
You can't let an old man like that beat you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(My opponent is not an ordinary old man. However, I will prove that I can break his testimony without fail!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Sirhan Dogen)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Dogen, there is a contradiction in your testimony!
Dogen:
I can't see any problems, but... Anubis, what do you think? Heh... Anubis also says there is no contradiction.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (Refuted by a dog!)
Kay:
He can talk to the dog, just like John can talk with the Mighty Moozilla!
John:
Hmph... Don't put me in the same class as gramps.
Edgeworth:
(Talking with dogs aside... I need to think things over one more time.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Simon Keyes)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes. Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
Simon:
Well... what about it, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Don't you understand? The significance of this piece of evidence.
Simon:
No, I don't get it! But you don't get it either, do you, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
Gaaaargh! (So it wasn't this...)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Don't get caught up in your opponent's face!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It seems I was a bit too careless. Simon Keyes! You won't get the better of me!
Kay:
Attaboy, Mr. Edgeworth! Steal the truth! For great justice!
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Simon Keyes)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes. This piece of evidence...
Simon:
Objection!
Simon:
Mr. Edgeworth. Why don't you take that back?
Edgeworth:
I haven't said anything yet!
Simon:
You don't have to say anything. After all... ...the look on your face tells me you're about to make an idiotic stuff.
Edgeworth:
Nwargh! (What's wrong with my face!?)
Ray:
He's one tough cookie, but... Miles, you'll be okay, right?
Edgeworth:
I'll be fine, Mr. Shields. I won't give up here.
Ray:
He he heh. I thought you'd say that. Uncle Ray believes in you. You're an Edgeworth, after all. I'm sure you'll reveal the whole truth for us!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. I shall expose the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth!
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Simon Keyes)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Simon Keyes! Your statement contradicts this evidence!
Simon:
Really now? What do you think, Ms. Courtney?
Courtney:
M-Me...? Prosecutor Edgeworth... I'm terribly sorry, but... ...I do not believe there is any correction.
Edgeworth:
Gaaargh! (So I was mistaken...)
Simon:
Gyahahaha! Even your little support team is rejecting your arguments, Mr. Edgeworth! Just what I'd expect from the GENIUS prosecutor! There's no way I could EVER mimic YOU!
Kay:
Simon thinks he's already won. Are you fine with that!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I won't back down now. Let's silence him with evidence!
Too many penalties
Edgeworth:
Ngh! To come this far, only to lose the truth...! But... it seems there's nothing I can do now...
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Nothing to Examine
Edgeworth:
There's nothing of interest here.
