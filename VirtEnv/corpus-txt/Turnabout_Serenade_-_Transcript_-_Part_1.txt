Episode 3Turnabout Serenade
Let's rock!!!
Klavier:
We love you! Rock on, everyone! This party's not over yet! Get out your handkerchiefs for our special guest! That's right, baby! The night's just getting started!
Thank you for coming to the Gavinners: "Guilty as Charged" Tour! This ends the first part of tonight's show. There will now be a 20-minute intermission.
July 7, 8:05 PM
Backstage Hallway
Trucy:
This is so cool! Us, at a Gavinners concert! 
Apollo:
Huh? Did you say something? My ears are still ringing... The Gavinners: putting the "sick" back in "music".
Trucy:
Well, I thought Mr. Gavin was really nice! Sending us those tickets at 20% off! They're hard to get ahold of, you know.
Apollo:
When you invite people to a concert it's usually free.
Trucy:
Let's head to his dressing room, Apollo! You know, like we're a couple of VIPs. I've always dreamed of being a VIP at a Gavinners show!
Apollo:
Um, Trucy... You didn't know who Prosecutor Gavin was before that case. What kind of fan doesn't know the lead vocalist's name?
Trucy:
Oh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in...
Trucy:
Klavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy!
Trucy:
Yeah, but I'm a girl! I'm supposed to swoon over gods of rock!
Apollo:
God-awful, maybe.
Trucy:
I bought all their stuff on the way home from the trial! I got twelve Gavinners albums, and fifteen concert videos!
Apollo:
...That was quite a bit of impulse shopping.
Trucy:
I got an advance on my next 15-years-worth of allowance.
Apollo:
...For Mr. Wright that sounds like a real act of generosity.
Apollo:
(Who would have imagined me here... ...at a Gavinners concert, watching Prosecutor Gavin "rock". To be honest... ...he was kind of cool. And I'm kind of envious. Not that I'd ever admit that to Trucy.)
Examine evidence
Attorney's badge
Back side
Apollo:
There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it.
July 7
Gavinners's Dressing Room
Klavier:
Ah, you made it.
Trucy:
Mr. Gavin! Thanks so much for the tickets!
Apollo:
...And the invoice you sent along with them.
Trucy:
You were incredible up on stage, Mr. Gavin!
Klavier:
Nothing like music to brighten the mood after a trial, ja? ...And we're almost ready for our next act. I'm looking forward to it myself.
Trucy:
Lamiroir's singing, right!? The "Siren of the Ballad"?
Apollo:
Oh yeah... That flyer said she flew all the way over for this show.
Klavier:
That's right. I happened to catch her show while overseas. Her voice... is divine. I knew I had to invite her to perform with us.
???:
Lamiroir says... "You praise me too highly."
Apollo:
(Whoa! Who's this guy? He's huge!)
Klavier:
Ah, allow me to introduce Mr. Romein LeTouse. ...Lamiroir's manager. And her interpreter, incidentally.
LeTouse:
It is a great honor for us to be here. And a great honor for Lamiroir to be heard in this country.
???:
[Borginese speaking]....
Apollo:
(That voice... I wish I could understand it... It's beautiful.)
???:
[Borginese speaking]....
Trucy:
Ooooh! It's Lamiroir! I'm actually meeting Lamiroir!
Apollo:
(Lamiroir... Mysterious songstress... Her quiet, deep song glides through the air... Lilting above a sparse, but elegant piano accompaniment. Now this is music. She's a real artist.)
Lamiroir:
[Borginese speaking]....
LeTouse:
Lamiroir says... "We have long looked forward to this joint performance."
Klavier:
Ah, Lamiroir... Your voice... ...It is art.
Lamiroir:
[Borginese speaking]....
LeTouse:
"Yet without his piano to guide me... ...it is but a voice."
???:
....................
Apollo:
(I've seen this kid somewhere before.)
Trucy:
He plays piano at all of Lamiroir's concerts! He's cute! And he's a really good pianist.
Apollo:
Good pianists are a dying breed, I hear.
LeTouse:
Allow me to introduce Machi Tobaye. ...He is blind. This is why he never strays far from Lamiroir. They are always together.
Machi:
....................
Apollo:
(They're like characters from some fairy tale..)
Trucy:
Lamiroir's so, um, what's that word... Exotic! ...And mysterious!
Apollo:
She does seem quite pretty. At least, her eyes do.
Klavier:
Hers is a kind of "sight-seeing musique"...
Trucy:
Huh?
Klavier:
She travels the globe, putting the sights she sees into song. Even though her appearance and voice are exotic... ...her songs remind us of something close, and warm.
Trucy:
Sights into song... That's so poetic!
Klavier:
She was gracious enough to put music to my lyrics tonight. "The Guitar's Serenade". ...I hope you enjoy it.
Trucy:
I can't wait!
Klavier:
...And now it is time. For the next part, we're giving the Gavinners's hard rock a little rest. Lamiroir, the stage is yours.
Lamiroir:
[Borginese speaking]....
LeTouse:
The band members will not play during Lamiroir's ballad. Only Machi's tender tones, and Lamiroir's dulcet voice...
Klavier:
...And my guitar, of course.
Trucy:
Woo hoo! Nights like this make it all worthwhile, you know!
Apollo:
(I should have learned to play the guitar. There's not much romance in Chords of Steel.)
Klavier:
Shall we hit the stage, then?
Trucy:
Good luck, Mr. Gavin!
Klavier:
Take care your hearts aren't stolen away, ja?
Trucy:
Let's get back to the concert hall, Polly!
Sugar, Sugar...
O that night, in your embrace.
When you stole away the keys
my heart held on to so tight.
Pleasure...
But a fleeting melody
It wraps itself around me,
And now through the air I fly.
Woh... Woh...
Burning on in my heart. Fire.
Burn my love away. All away.
Like a bullet of love. Fire.
Take my life away. All away.
Guitar, Guitar...
Up together to the sky.
July 7, 9:05 PM
Backstage Hallway
Trucy:
Wow, wasn't Lamiroir amazing? I *sniffle* I even cried a little!
Apollo:
I was surprised Prosecutor Gavin actually burned his guitar.
Trucy:
Yeah! That even surprised me, and I'm a magician! What a production!
Apollo:
What a destruction. (I don't think Prosecutor Gavin was expecting it either, oddly. He looked as surprised as I was.)
Trucy:
Is that what they call "risking life and limb for art"? I think he's my new hero!
Apollo:
I'm not sure I'd call that "art".
Trucy:
Well, what are we doing here? Let's get going to Mr. Gavin's dressing room! There's twenty minutes till the last part of the show!
Apollo:
How many breaks does this band need?
July 7
Gavinners's Dressing Room
Klavier:
What the heck was that!? I was never consulted about it!
Staff:
S-Sorry, Mr. Gavin, sir! I've asked the man in charge...
Klavier:
I play new rock, not Great Balls of Fire! Speaking of fire, I have a good mind to fire whoever's responsible!
Trucy:
...He seems upset.
Klavier:
Apollo Justice! Were you the one who tried to torch me!?
Apollo:
Hey, I didn't do it!
Trucy:
So much for risking your life for art...
Klavier:
"The Guitar's Serenade" is ruined! Ruined!
Trucy:
Well, let's try to talk to him at least.
Apollo:
...I'm not sure that's the best move right now.
Examine
Black gloves
Apollo:
Those are some pretty heavy-duty gloves. Maybe they have to carry around hot pots or something?
Trucy:
They are a little thick. I couldn't even stuff a pigeon in those.
Apollo:
...... That's exactly what I was thinking.
Bowl of stew
Apollo:
Why is that plastic bowl of stew sitting there?
Trucy:
Maybe they use it for interrogating bad guys... "'Fess up to what you did, and we'll let you eat that stew!"
Apollo:
That's just mean.
Trucy:
It gets worse! See, if the bad guy confesses, they say: "OK, eat it... If you can! See, it's made of plastic!" It's like, you don't know which ones are the real bad guys!
Apollo:
I think you need to take a deep breath, Trucy.
Chains
Apollo:
This place is decorated like a high-school dance. Though I think our decorations were paper, not... chains.
Trucy:
The Gavinners are into chains. It's part of their image.
Apollo:
Huh, no kidding.
Trucy:
Ever since they used chains on the cover art for "Gunna Lock U Up".
Apollo:
They're really into the whole police thing, aren't they.
Trucy:
It'd be cooler if they turned that red light on.
Apollo:
...They don't have to turn on the red light.
Cruiser Guitar
Trucy:
Ooh! A "Cruiser Guitar"! They sold those to commemorate five years of the band.
Apollo:
Rocking it hard... under the speed limit.
Trucy:
There's a "Cruiser Bass", and a "Cruiser Drum Set", and a "Cruiser Keyboard"... ...Even a "Cruiser Whistle".
Apollo:
...I'm not so sure about that last one.
Trucy:
It's for blowing the whistle on criminals!
Apollo:
...I don't think that requires an actual whistle, Trucy.
Lipstick on mirror
Apollo:
Someone drew the Gavinners's mark in lipstick here.
Trucy:
Lipstick... I'd like to wear lipstick someday.
Apollo:
Oh? You don't use lipstick yet, Trucy?
Trucy:
Daddy won't let me. "Not until I learn to play piano," he says.
Apollo:
You'll be waiting a long time then, I'm afraid.
Police uniform
Apollo:
A police uniform hangs on the stand here.
Trucy:
Ooh! I want to try it on! "Nothing to see here, move along."
Apollo:
...It's OK, you don't have to go that far to be "special". I mean, you're not exactly the type who's "just another face in the crowd".
Trucy:
Really? You think so? Hmm... I guess you're right!
Apollo:
(...Now I feel like a meanie for making that insinuation.)
Postcards
Trucy:
Look! It's a postcard of Lamiroir!
Apollo:
What are these letters at the bottom? I've never seen these before.
Trucy:
It must be her native tongue, Borginese!
Apollo:
Borginese, huh...?
Postcard added to the Court Record.
Postcards (subsequent times)
Apollo:
It's a stack of Lamiroir's postcards. They have an air of mystery to them that matches her voice.
Red Badger Guitar
Trucy:
That guitar! That's the legendary AA-400! The "Red Badger".
Apollo:
I thought rock was supposed to be rebellious, not... civic.
Trucy:
Every aspiring guitarist wants one of these! They even paint their own guitars to look like it.
Apollo:
Ah, the fickleness of youth.
Trucy:
You should dye your hair "Badger Red", too!
Apollo:
I like my hair the way it is, thank you very much.
Trucy:
Argh, the stubbornness of age!
Speaker
Apollo:
That speaker looks familiar.
Trucy:
Oh?
Apollo:
Yeah, like the one for the P.A. system back in school.
Trucy:
Oh, we have one of those in my classroom, too!
Apollo:
(That's right, she's still in junior high. ...I feel old.)
Wall poster
Apollo:
What's a police recruitment poster doing here? "Rock on ...with the police."
Trucy:
Maybe they're trying to trick kids into thinking the police are some kind of band.
Apollo:
But that's just silly. Who'd name a band the "police"?
Move
Trucy:
Apollo! Where do you think you're going!?
Apollo:
Huh? Oh, I was just...
Trucy:
Let's talk to Mr. Gavin while we have the chance!
Apollo:
(OK, I suppose...)
Talk
The flaming guitar
Trucy:
You mean, the guitar... That wasn't part of the act?
Klavier:
Part of the act!? Who'd burn up a guitar on purpose!?
Trucy:
But, it worked really well with the lyrics just then... Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away. All away.
Klavier:
......&#160;! Wait, you think the audience thought it was...?
Apollo:
(Sounds like he got lucky.)
Trucy:
They probably thought it was part of the act. At least, I did.
Klavier:
......
Apollo:
(He got lucky, and he didn't realize it...)
Klavier:
A-Anyway, that guitar was the Ferrari of guitars! All the speed, all the sound ...and all the price. If I burned one of those at every show I'd go broke!
Apollo:
Unusually frugal for a rock band.
Trucy:
Try saying that to Mr. Gavin.
Klavier:
Achtung! Today's been one disaster after another... My hog won't run, my guitar case's broken...
Trucy:
Daddy told me there'd be days like these.
Lamiroir's song
Trucy:
W-Wasn't Lamiroir's song incredible!? You worked on it too, right, Mr. Gavin?
Klavier:
Ah, yes, thanks. It was a collaboration. I wrote the lyrics, and she wrote the melody.
Trucy:
You know... I was surprised she could sing in English...
Klavier:
I'm sure she practiced a long time for this day. Ah, here.
Apollo:
What's this...?
Klavier:
A lyrics sheet. It's yours. Signed by myself and Lamiroir.
Trucy:
Yippee! Thanks so much!
Apollo:
(All I ever get to sign are client defense agreements.)
Lyrics Sheet added to the Court Record.
Lamiroir's song (subsequent times)
Klavier:
For that song, I wrote the lyrics and she wrote the melody. It was a collaboration.
Trucy:
That's so cool... I'd love to do a collaboration myself some day, or a song...
Apollo:
You can't do a collaboration alone, you know, Trucy.
Trucy:
I know that!
Klavier:
Then practice singing those lyrics. If you get good, I'll invite you into the band.
Trucy:
Eeeek! R-Really!? I'll sing 'em every day!
Apollo:
What about your magic act?
Trucy:
...... Maybe I can be a singing and dancing magician!
Apollo:
Then you'd end up only being average in both, no?
Klavier:
Not at all. Why, I'm a rock star and a star prosecutor.
Apollo:
Urk! (That's right, he is. I'd totally forgotten.)
Trucy:
Ooh! See, you can excel in more than one thing!
Apollo:
(Ugh... I'm having trouble enough with just one thing.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Klavier:
...... Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
Y-Yeah?
Klavier:
Understand that I am not Prosecutor Gavin now. I am lead vocal of the Gavinners. That badge sings a different song... on a different stage.
Apollo:
Right... (I wish I had an alter-ego to hide behind sometimes.)
Postcard
Apollo:
What are those postcards there, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
Eh? Lamiroir's, you mean? It's part of her PR campaign. I received a stack. You can have one if you'd like.
Apollo:
...Ah, that's good to hear. Trucy already swiped one, is why.
Trucy:
Eh! B-But that... But I... ... What's the big idea!? Making me look like a criminal... It was... a collaboration! I've always wanted to do a collaboration!
Klavier:
Usually, a collaboration is for creating, not stealing.
Apollo:
...Let the kid dream.
Lyrics Sheet
Klavier:
I wrote those lyrics, you know. Though it was Lamiroir who gave them life.
Trucy:
Wow... That's beautiful!
Apollo:
(Grr. Maybe I should try to write some lyrics someday.)
After clearing all Talk options:
Klavier:
Almost time for the third act of the night.
Trucy:
Oh! There's more?
Klavier:
Yes! Lamiroir's part is done. Now it's time for us to drop our groove again, ja? Hope you're ready to catch it.
Trucy:
Woo hoo! Ready, Apollo?
Apollo:
Uh... I think I'll pass.
Trucy:
Eh.
Apollo:
I liked the bit with Lamiroir. But the rest could use a volume knob. Turned way down.
Trucy:
Ah, Apollo, you're getting old!
Apollo:
Ack! (Does 22 quality as "old" to a 15-year-old...?)
Trucy:
Well, I'm going!
Klavier:
Let the old folks rest backstage, ja? ...Time to rock.
Apollo:
(Hey, you're older than I am!)
Examine
Black gloves
Apollo:
Thick leather gloves and sunglasses... Maybe I'll try these on... ...On second thought, no. They might be evidence for one of Prosecutor Gavin's cases.
Bowl of stew
Apollo:
A delicious bowl of stew! ...Made of plastic. Huh, the bottom of the bowl has a "G" on it. They sell these at concerts? Whatever happened to T-shirts?
Chains
Apollo:
Chains dangle from the ceiling. They aren't "glimmerous", but I bet Detective Skye'd have something to say about them.
Cruiser Guitar
Apollo:
That guitar looks like it was made out of a cop car door. ...... That's right. Trucy's not here to set me straight. Now I feel kinda lonely.
Lipstick on mirror
Apollo:
There's graffiti on the mirror... in lipstick. Wait, but the Gavinners are all guys. ...Maybe Prosecutor Gavin wears lipstick?
Police uniform
Apollo:
A police uniform. Next to it is a policeman's hat, and a pair of handcuffs. One of the band members must like the police. Must be Mr. Gavin's "bad influence". ...... I thought rock 'n' roll was all about being rebellious.
Postcards
Apollo:
A postcard of Lamiroir... I can't read a single word of the sentence at the bottom. Hmm. Trucy might want one of these. I'll show it to her next time we're here.
Red Badger Guitar
Apollo:
That's an odd guitar. The design is that character I saw in the hallway, but with sunglasses. What a strange mascot. He looks like he's crying. Since when was rock about crying? ...They should name this guy "Emo".
Speaker
Apollo:
An old-fashioned speaker hangs from the ceiling. That must be to monitor what's happening out on stage. I think we had the same kind for my school's P.A. system.
Wall poster
Apollo:
...That police officer looks ready to rock. Some kids must see this and actually want to be cops. Somehow I don't think a rocking defense attorney would work too well.
July 7
Backstage Hallway
Ema:
Hey, it's you! That Wright kid.
Apollo:
Detective Skye! (I'll let that "Wright kid" business pass.)
Ema:
Call me Ema. There's no need for titles once you've shared a bottle of fingerprinting powder!
Apollo:
That's a new one. So, um, Ema, what are you doing here?
Ema:
...Isn't it obvious? I'm snacking. You think I want to be here!? Me, in charge of security in this pit!?
Apollo:
Security...? Did something happen?
Ema:
There's no knowing with that glimmerous fop. Apparently, he's all upset because something was stolen. He wanted security back here during the concert. Where does he get off acting like he's some big rock star?
Apollo:
(...He is a big rock star.)
Ema:
Hey! You listening to me?
Apollo:
So... Where's this door here lead to?
Ema:
This one? That's Lamiroir's dressing room. Don't even think of going in there unless you want a piece of Snackoos in your face!
Apollo:
(Is she ever in a good mood, I wonder?)
Examine
Blue Badger doll
Apollo:
What's that odd looking doll doing there?
Ema:
MUNCH MUNCH... oh, MUNCH, that's the Blue MUNCH Badger.
Apollo:
Could you try either talking or munching, but not both?
*ka-tonk*
Apollo:
(She hit me with a snack.)
Ema:
Serves me MUNCH right MUNCH for going MUNCH out MUNCH of MUNCH my MUNCH way MUNCH
Apollo:
...... (Sorry, I don't speak Snackoos.)
Ema:
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
Earpiece
Apollo:
What's this? Some kind of headset earpiece?
Ema:
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
Apollo:
Why would someone leave this in the hallway?
Ema:
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
Apollo:
Maybe Lamiroir's bodyguard dropped it?
Ema:
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
Apollo:
Ema! Will you stop eating those snacks for one second and listen!?
Ema:
Hah! If you think you're going to pull me away from my snacks just to hear you mumbling... ...on and on about whatever, you're going to be sorely disappointed!
Apollo:
(...At least I got her to stop munching.)
Instrument trunk
Apollo:
That's a pretty sturdy-looking box there. Maybe it's an instrument case. There's a guitar next to it.
Ema:
Don't even think about taking that!
Apollo:
I don't think I could even carry it...
*ka-tonk*
Apollo:
(She Snackoo'd me.)
Left hallway door
Apollo:
That's Prosecutor Gavin's... er, the Gavinners's dressing room.
Ema:
Put so much as a hand on the door and I'll Snackoo you.
Apollo:
Hold on! But I just came out of there!
Ema:
Don't play smart with me!
Apollo:
(*sigh*)
Right hallway door
Leads to:
"So this is Lamiroir's dressing room."
Vending machine
Apollo:
Come to think of it, I am a little thirsty.
Ema:
I'll have some tea.
Apollo:
...... I think I'll get a water.
Ema:
I'll have tea!
Apollo:
If you want tea so bad go buy it yourself!
*ka-tonk*
Apollo:
(She Snackoo'd me.)
Ema:
I'll take a tea.
Wall poster
Apollo:
A Gavinners "Guilty As Charged" tour poster.
Ema:
They're plastered all over the place. It's annoying.
Apollo:
Well, this is the concert venue. It makes sense.
Ema:
Why? Everyone here is already here! Why advertise to them?
Apollo:
People like to see the poster at the concert... It's part of the experience.
Ema:
Do you have to find fault with everything I say?
*ka-tonk*
Apollo:
(She Snackoo'd me.)
Talk
Any option
Apollo:
Um... Ema?
Ema:
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
Apollo:
(I've never seen someone eat snacks with such vehemence. Better give her a wide berth...)
*ka-tonk*
Apollo:
(She Snackoo'd me.)
Present
Anything
Apollo:
Ema, could you take a look at this?
Ema:
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
Apollo:
Um... What do you think?
Ema:
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
Apollo:
(That must be a bottomless bag of snacks.)
Apollo:
So this is Lamiroir's dressing room.
Ema:
If you even think about going in there, I'll--
...BANG...!
Apollo:
......
Ema:
......
Apollo:
What was that?
...BANG...!
Apollo:
Was that... a gunshot?
...CRASH...!
Apollo:
(Something's going on!)
Ema:
You, out of my way!
Apollo:
E-Ema!
Ema:
Lamiroir! Lamiroir!
......
Ema:
It's not locked... I'm going in!
July 7, 9:30 PM
Lamiroir's Dressing Room
Apollo:
(What's that awful noise... Oh, it's the concert.) Aaack! That's-- (It's Lamiroir's manager! Mister what's-his-name...)
Ema:
LeTouse! Oh no... Hey, you!
Apollo:
M-Me?
Ema:
Watch this room for me. I have to call for backup!
Apollo:
R-Right, understood. You want me to make sure no one comes in, right?
Ema:
And don't touch anything! I'll be right back!
Apollo:
(...What's going on? I just talked to him, and now...)
LeTouse:
......Nnnh......
Apollo:
...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?
LeTouse:
...Sh...Shot. ...I was...shot.
Apollo:
Who? Who shot you!?
LeTouse:
...I don't know... Ask...
Apollo:
Ask? Ask what?
LeTouse:
Ask... wi...witness...
Apollo:
Witness... There was a witness!? Who!?
LeTouse:
...Cold... so cold... Witness...
Apollo:
You're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!
LeTouse:
...Can't s...see...
Apollo:
Hang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?
LeTouse:
The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...
Apollo:
(..."Siren"? How can a siren witness anything...?) Mr. LeTouse! Yipes! Ema!? (What was that!?) Wh-Who's there!?
Ema:
What's wrong?
Apollo:
Ema! Did you see anyone just now!?
Ema:
Huh? No...
Apollo:
(I could have sworn I heard a door close...)
Ema:
The concert's been cancelled. Backup's on its way. Is Mr. LeTouse... ...He's dead, isn't he? That's terrible.
Apollo:
...! (I lost him!)
Apollo:
(Romein LeTouse... shot. And I heard his last words... "The witness is the siren"... Whatever that means.)
July 7
Backstage Hallway
???:
The venue's locked down. We took names and addresses before letting the crowd go.
Klavier:
Good work, Daryan.
???:
I'll let you know if I find out anything about the victim. Later.
Klavier:
It's investigation time, then, ja, Fräulein Detective?
Ema:
I don't need some rock 'n' rolling prosecutor to tell me that.
Klavier:
One request I must make... Tell no one, on staff or otherwise, anything of this.
Trucy:
Ooh, a gag order!
Klavier:
No word gets out, other than that Mr. LeTouse is dead. No word of the cause of death, or of the murder.
Apollo:
Tell no one... Not even Lamiroir?
Klavier:
Not even her. We must keep everything under wraps. Oh, one other thing. I'll need your signature on this, Herr Forehead. Yours too, Fräulein.
Apollo:
On that? Hmm... An "Investigation Request"...?
Trucy:
Why just us?
Klavier:
You two are civilians. It's standard procedure.
Apollo:
(That should be OK to sign, I think...)
Signed Prosecutor Gavin's Investigation Request.
Klavier:
Right, well, get started with the investigation!
Ema:
I'm on it already!
Klavier:
Ah, and one tip for you.
Apollo:
Huh? Me?
Klavier:
Try not to get in the Fräulein detective's way. ...She's in a foul mood today.
Apollo:
(Gee, I wonder why...)
Apollo:
(We were all questioned as witnesses... ...And now none of us can go home. We'll investigate alright. ...Our way!)
Trucy:
...Somehow I don't see us getting back to that crime scene any time soon.
Apollo:
I still can't believe I was there when it happened. Not an experience I care to repeat any time soon.
Trucy:
This is no time for navel-gazing! Let's crack this case!
Apollo:
(I worry about Trucy. She seems to have a very loose idea of what it means to be an "attorney". Of course, that's not surprising considering who her father is...)
Trucy:
Something the matter?
Apollo:
No... Let's get cracking!
Apollo:
(I'm the only one who was there... The only one who heard Mr. LeTouse's last words.)
LeTouse:
The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...
Apollo:
(First order of business is to find out what he meant by "siren"!)
Examine
Blue Badger doll
Trucy:
That's the Blue Badger, the police mascot!
Apollo:
Does the Blue Badger have something to do with the band?
Trucy:
Well, yeah! The Blue Badger is the Gavinners's mascot, too!
Apollo:
Huh. Go figure.
Trucy:
I hear those things fly off the shelves.
Apollo:
(I'll have to take a closer look at one some day.)
Earpiece
Trucy:
What's that? It looks like some kind of future-phone!
Apollo:
Not a phone, a transceiver. It's called a "headset".
Trucy:
What's a headset doing on the floor? Wait! Do you think Mr. LeTouse might have been wearing it? Like one of those bodyguards?
Apollo:
Hmm. I don't think he was wearing one when we first met. (The L.E.D. on this thing is lit. It must be on.)
Instrument trunk
Apollo:
Looks like an instrument case. A big instrument case.
Trucy:
There's a great magic trick you can do with one of these!
Apollo:
Huh? What kind?
Trucy:
The "Miraculous Beautiful Girl Escapes the Case" illusion.
Apollo:
So it's the girl who's miraculous, not the escape?
Trucy:
So picky!
Left hallway door
Apollo:
That's the Gavinners's dressing room. The crime scene was Lamiroir's dressing room... ...Next door.
Trucy:
Never know where clues might be hiding, Apollo! Let's case this joint!
Apollo:
(After you, Trucy, P.I.)
Right hallway door
Apollo:
Lamiroir's dressing room...
Trucy:
The scene of the crime!
Apollo:
We're not supposed to go in there.
Trucy:
But aren't we involved? Aren't we duty-bound to investigate!?
Apollo:
Sadly, no. (Though, the situation being what it is... Now may be our best chance to do some snooping...)
Vending machine
Trucy:
I'm thirsty, Apollo!
Apollo:
...Want something to drink?
Trucy:
Hmm... How about... this one! A Steel Samurai Soda!
Apollo:
("Now in Real Steel flavor.") ...Hmm.
Trucy:
Huh?
Apollo:
...Here, my treat.
Trucy:
Hey! This isn't enough change.
Apollo:
The machines outside are cheaper. This one is highway robbery.
Wall poster
Apollo:
A concert poster for the "Guilty as Charged" Tour.
Trucy:
I love that name! "Guilty As Charged"!
Apollo:
...Seems kind of negative to me.
Trucy:
Well, why don't we do the opposite! Magician Trucy presents the "Innocent as Charged" tour!
Apollo:
It kind of loses its impact, doesn't it?
July 7
Gavinners's Dressing Room
Trucy:
Huh. Looks like nobody's here.
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin's probably busy with the case, too. No rest for the wicked.
Trucy:
No rest for us, either, Apollo! Let's get rocking! Rock, rock!
July 7
In the Wings
Trucy:
Hmm. The stage looks empty.
Apollo:
I was hoping to get a chance to talk to Prosecutor Gavin...
Trucy:
Oh well. Nothing to do but go to the crime scene, I guess!
Apollo:
I guess...
Examine
Computer
Apollo:
Look at all these electronic devices. I'm guessing they have something to do with sound.
Trucy:
Why guess when we can fiddle? Hmm... let's see here...
Apollo:
Don't touch that!
Trucy:
A healthy curiosity is the key to a good investigation! When in doubt, fiddle! That's what Daddy always says.
Apollo:
(They should require parental testing, clearly...)
Guitar case
Apollo:
Now that's a big instrument case.
Trucy:
That's a case for a contrabass, I think.
Apollo:
You could fit twenty violins in there, I bet.
Trucy:
It may look like a violin, but it's a completely different instrument!
Apollo:
You could fit five Trucys in there, I bet.
Trucy:
Hey! Are you comparing me to an instrument? Hmm. I wonder who left it sitting open like that.
(Step)ladder
Apollo:
Look, a ladder. I guess they need one to work on the lights and such.
Trucy:
Why don't they use a stepladder? I prefer stepladders, really. ...Is that so wrong?
Apollo:
Not wrong, just... well, why do you prefer stepladders?
Trucy:
...... They're so much more flexible than plain old ladders!
Apollo:
...... (I prefer my ladders rigid and stable, thank you.)
Piano
Trucy:
Wow, that piano looks much bigger close up! Machi played so beautifully...
Apollo:
Yeah, like a real pianist.
Trucy:
That's just silly, Apollo! How can you call someone as good as Machi a "pianist"? Why, that's like throwing him in the same class as Daddy!
Apollo:
...Good thing Mr. Wright didn't hear that one.
Stage
Trucy:
What a big stage! It's on a whole other scale than the Wonder Bar!
Apollo:
The lights were so bright I couldn't see the whole first part of the concert.
Trucy:
I'd love to do my act on a stage like this some day!
Apollo:
Just hold back on the lights, for my eyes' sake, please.
Trucy:
You'll be too blinded by my magic to worry about lights!
Apollo:
You probably don't want to blind the audience if you plan on showing them magic.
July 7Lamiroir's Dressing Room
Ema:
Oh, it's you. I figured you'd come.
Apollo:
You have to let us investigate the scene, please!
Ema:
You're attorneys, no? Shouldn't you wait until you have a client...?
Apollo:
(LeTouse did tell me to ask the witness, the siren... ...With his dying breath, no less. Doesn't that count?)
Ema:
...G-Glare at me all you want, you'll get no snacks from me.
Trucy:
Please! Think of poor Lamiroir!
Ema:
Hmph. Oh well, I suppose. You did find the body with me.
Apollo:
Great! Let's get to it!
Trucy:
Right!
Ema:
Just try not to touch anything!
Apollo:
(She's letting us look! And she's not munching her snacks! This bodes well. There are clues here, I can feel it! Leave no hanger unhung, no spot unspotted!)
Examine
Air vent
Apollo:
......
Trucy:
What's wrong, Apollo? Your mouth is catching flies.
Apollo:
Ah? Um, nothing. It's nothing.
Ema:
"Maybe that's how the killer escaped." ...That's what you were thinking, right?
Apollo:
Eh.
Ema:
When we arrived on the scene, the killer had already fled. He or she must have had a way out. And that air vent is one possibility.
Trucy:
But it's much too small.
Apollo:
Hmm... Not if the killer were about your size, Trucy...
Trucy:
......
Apollo:
......
Trucy:
I didn't do it!
Apollo:
Eh.
Trucy:
I was cutting up the dance floor at the time, thank you!
Apollo:
I know, I know! Of course I don't think you did it.
Trucy:
It's hard to tell with you, sometimes, Apollo.
Apollo:
(Hey! What have I done?)
Brooch
Trucy:
Ooh, what a pretty brooch! Oh, Ema...?
Ema:
You're not going to say, "Can I have it, please," are you?
Trucy:
Oh.
Ema:
Look you may be a cute little girl of fifteen... ...but that doesn't get you any special treatment with me!
Trucy:
Oh...
Apollo:
It's not healthy to envy the young, Ema.
Ema:
It's not about envy! It's about tampering with evidence!
Apollo:
(Note to self: Ema lacks a sense of humor. Use caution.)
Ema:
You need to learn to respect your elders a little!
Apollo:
(...Something seems so familiar about that brooch.)
Brooch added to the Court Record.
Brooch (subsequent times)
Trucy:
......
Apollo:
(Trucy's still after that brooch, clearly...)
Ema:
No way! If you want one that bad, get your daddy to buy it for you!
Trucy:
Daddy always says: "Trucy, if you want something go find or borrow it." Oh, and "When in doubt, beg."
Ema:
Leave it to Mr. Wright...
Apollo:
(I'm a little concerned for Trucy's future... But I'm more concerned about the owner of that brooch.)
Bullet holes
Trucy:
Are these... bullet holes?
Apollo:
Looks like it. There are two here in the wall.
Ema:
From the look of it, the victim was shot once in the shoulder. The first shot must have missed.
Trucy:
But there are two holes. Wouldn't that mean two misses?
Ema:
The murder weapon is a 45-caliber revolver. It's very powerful. I believe what we're seeing here... ...is the mark left by the second bullet after it passed through his shoulder!
Trucy:
Ouch... Sounds painful.
Apollo:
(No kidding. I wonder about this murder weapon...)
Fruit basket
Trucy:
Ooh! Apollo! Can I eat some of those, please!?
Ema:
Absolutely not!
Trucy:
I know. I know! But still, I yearn!
Ema:
Look, you're not the only one eyeing that fruit here.
Trucy:
Well then, what are we waiting for? Let's eat!
Ema:
Right!
Apollo:
Whoa whoa whoa! Stop it! Are you two crazy? Ema, you of all people should know better...
Ema:
But she tempted me! She's a... She's a temptress!
Apollo:
(Please, grow up...)
(Step)ladder
Apollo:
Huh, another ladder.
Trucy:
Actually, it's technically a stepladder.
Apollo:
Well hello, Ms. Fancy Pants! Please forgive my lack of ladder discrimination.
Trucy:
! ......
Ema:
I'm less worried about the stepladder, and more worried about why it's there.
Apollo:
(Why is the ladder there? Well, to climb, right? To reach something on the ceiling?)
Trucy:
...... I still say it's a stepladder.
Poster next to TV
Apollo:
What's this poster...?
Trucy:
Let's see... "This Summer: A Legal Eagles Production of 'Case Closed'." ...Looks like a poster for a different show.
Apollo:
...One I wouldn't mind seeing real soon.
Poster over TV
Apollo:
There's another Gavinners poster here.
Ema:
I'm just about sick of seeing those, personally. Maybe I'll tear it down! Ha ha!
Apollo:
No tampering with the crime scene, Ema!
Ema:
Hmph. Maybe there's something else I can tear to shreds...
Trucy:
D-Don't look at me!
Speaker
Apollo:
That speaker was blaring at the time of the murder...
Ema:
Ah, that's for monitoring the stage from this room.
Trucy:
Monitoring?
Ema:
It pipes in a real-time feed from the stage microphones. Useful for knowing when your set is coming up.
Apollo:
Yes, I seem to recall it being loud and vaguely musical. (It made it hard to hear Mr. LeTouse's last words.)
Television
Trucy:
Ah, ah, Apollo! Look at that thing! It's huge! That... That's a TV!!!
Apollo:
Um, yeah, a wide flatscreen TV. I want one of those.
Ema:
You'll be wanting for a long time on your salary, junior. Wait till you're as famous as Mr. Wright was, then dream.
Trucy:
I don't think Daddy was ever rich, even when he was in law.
Apollo:
Great, just stomp on my dreams why don't you.
Flower bouquet
Apollo:
What an amazing bouquet. I mean, it's giant.
Ema:
Not sure I approve. It'd be better if this flower was a bit more... Oh.
Trucy:
Eek! The flower fell off!
Apollo:
What happened to preserving the crime scene, Ema?
Ema:
It's fine! Fine! I'll just put it back, see?
Apollo:
(How scientific...)
Hairdryer
Apollo:
This is one of those... uh, things, right? At the barbers?
Ema:
A permanent dryer. Want me to curl those bangs of yours?
Apollo:
Um, no thanks.
Trucy:
Better not mess with his hair, Ema. It's part of his identity, you know.
LeTouse's body
Trucy:
Th-That's a body, isn't it?
Ema:
Sure is. The victim, no less. Let's take a closer look.
Trucy:
Eeek! G-Go ahead, Apollo. You first.
Apollo:
Me!? No, you should go first, Trucy, really...
Ema:
Will you two stop bickering and get over here!?
Apollo:
(She's munching on Snackoos again. Hope she's not too annoyed.)
LeTouse's left hand
Trucy:
Apollo, look at this hand...
Apollo:
Hmm. He's holding something.
Ema:
Hey! No touching!
Apollo:
You can throw all the snacks at me you'd like, Ema. But sooner or later... you're going to run out of them.
Ema:
Hmm. You raise a good point. ...I'm a bit intrigued by this scene. Let's take a look.
Trucy:
Ah... see there? He's holding something! What's this...?
Apollo:
...A key ring?
Trucy:
You think it might belong to the killer!?
Ema:
Certainly a possibility...
Apollo:
(What an unusual key ring... And what unusual keys. This could be a vital clue.)
Key Ring added to the Court Record.
LeTouse's left hand (subsequent times)
Apollo:
The body was holding a key ring...
Ema:
I wonder what it could mean?
Trucy:
It must mean something!
Apollo:
It doesn't look like the kind Mr. LeTouse would use. So the question is, whose key ring is it?
Ema:
Well, you're practically a detective there, Apollo.
Trucy:
Practically!
Apollo:
...... (I'm glad it brings them so much joy to mock me.)
Smeared blood
Trucy:
Eeek! Is that... blood? Umm... Why don't you examine this one, Apollo. You know more about, uh, red stuff than I do. Yep!
Apollo:
...Says who? (Something is strange about this blood, though... Is that what it looks like?)
Mirror dresser
Apollo:
Seeing these mirrors lined up like that makes me think I'm really in a dressing room.
Ema:
You are in a dressing room. Hmm... This must be makeup. ...I've never heard of most of these brands.
Ema:
Maybe they're Borginian?
Trucy:
Well, I haven't got a clue, and I doubt those are.
Presents
Apollo:
Look at all these presents. Lamiroir sure is popular.
Trucy:
Ooh! I wonder what's inside? We... can't open them, can we?
Ema:
Probably not a good idea. You never know what you might find in one of these boxes. Bombs, razors, ransom notes... It could be anything.
Trucy:
...... I'm never having a birthday party again.
Revolver
Apollo:
This is the murder weapon, isn't it? This revolver...?
Ema:
That's right. A big 45-caliber revolver.
Trucy:
Wow. I wonder who brought this in here? I thought only police were allowed to have one of those.
Apollo:
......
Ema:
Why are you giving me that look!? I didn't do it!
Apollo:
I didn't...
Ema:
Listen, I was out in the hall eating Snackoos when it happened!
Apollo:
I know, I know! No one here thinks you did it, Ema.
Ema:
It's hard to tell with you, sometimes, Apollo.
Apollo:
(Hey! What have I done?)
Trucy:
Wait... If the killer brought a revolver... ...it must mean they had planned this from the start. That's right, right?
Revolver added to the Court Record.
Revolver (subsequent times)
Apollo:
A 45-caliber revolver, very deadly.
Trucy:
You know, Apollo, I was wondering... What's a caliber? And what does the "45" mean?
Apollo:
Huh?
Ema:
Heh, you want me to tell you? It's the size of the barrel. Simply put, the larger the caliber, the bigger the round. ...The bullet, in other words. Bigger bullets do more damage.
Apollo:
Wow, chalk one point up for forensic science.
Ema:
You know it!
Trucy:
...But it's not 45 inches, right? That'd be too big. What's the unit of measurement they use, Ms. Science? Well?
Ema:
...... Hush. Kids shouldn't ask so many questions.
Small window
Trucy:
Look, there's a little window over here! Maybe the killer escaped through that!
Apollo:
It's barely big enough for me to get my head through.
Ema:
Not to mention it only opens a crack.
Trucy:
...What? I was just saying it's possible.
Apollo:
Right, right, no harm in that. (Except I'm pretty sure it is impossible.)
Ema:
You could peek into the room through it, though, you know.
Talk
The victim
Ema:
Mr. "Romein LeTouse", wasn't it? He was Lamiroir's manager. And interpreter, apparently. This was his first time in the country.
Trucy:
Hmm... So I'm guessing he didn't know many people here.
Ema:
It doesn't seem likely. Nor can I think of anyone with a motive to murder him. ...Except for one person, of course.
Trucy:
One person...? Who?
Apollo:
Lamiroir. No one here might have had a motive, but she's from...
Trucy:
What are you talking about!?
Apollo:
Urk! H-Hey, it was Ema's idea!
Ema:
I said nothing. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
Apollo:
(Always with the snacks...)
Trucy:
He's a big man. Or was. I don't think even I would win in a fight with him.
Apollo:
Which is why whoever it was used a revolver, I'm guessing.
Ema:
We've sent a request to the Borginian Embassy for more info on him.
The crime
Ema:
Well, you and I know more about the crime than anyone.
Trucy:
Y-You do?
Apollo:
That's true. It was us who found the body.
Trucy:
Whaaaa-!? Hmph. I guess that's what I miss for watching the concert.
Apollo:
Hey, I wish I was watching the concert. ...Anything would be better than this.
Ema:
Well, we know the crime took place during the concert.
Apollo:
And when we heard the shot and entered the room... ...the killer was already gone.
Trucy:
What? But that doesn't make sense! You came in when you heard the shot and no one was here? How did they leave the room?
Apollo:
Hmm, that window is a little too small, isn't it?
Ema:
......
Apollo:
(The mystery of the disappearing killer...)
The murder weapon (appears after presenting Revolver)
Ema:
What do you think about this revolver?
Apollo:
Well... it's pretty big. And heavy.
Ema:
That's right. It's a 45-caliber. That makes it one of the deadliest revolvers around. Even the police don't carry guns this big.
Apollo:
Really?
Ema:
Yeah. It doesn't make sense... You don't need so much power to kill at such close range. ...It's overkill.
Trucy:
I'm not sure I see the problem. I mean, whenever I go out to eat curry... ...I order it "extra spicy". Just to be sure it's spicy. Of course, I can only ever eat one or two bites.
Apollo:
...Um, and that's not a problem?
Ema:
There's another thing about a gun this big. It puts a lot of strain on the shooter.
Apollo:
Strain...?
Ema:
Yeah. Say, if you were to fire this revolver... ...the recoil would probably dislocate your shoulder.
Trucy:
Ouuuuuch! It's like the shooter's a victim, too!
Ema:
Yet, the killer used this revolver, and quite well. I'm guessing whoever did it was used to shooting.
Apollo:
(Used to shooting a high-caliber weapon? Hmm...)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Ema:
You always carry that around, do you? ...Just like Mr. Wright.
Apollo:
Huh?
Ema:
It's good to never let yourself forget who you are. I'm proud of you. Keep up the good work.
Apollo:
(...Come to think of it, why do I carry this around? Though I suppose that's one compliment it's got me.)
Revolver
Apollo:
So this... is the murder weapon? (This revolver is incredibly heavy!)
Ema:
It's been fired twice. You can still smell the gunpowder... ...That's odd.
Apollo:
What's odd?
Ema:
Hmm? Oh, nothing.
Trucy:
Hey, no fair! Tell us!
Ema:
It's just, something about this revolver seems... strange.
Apollo:
Strange...?
Anything else
Ema:
Hmm, sorry. I can't comment on anything not scientifically relevant. I am a forensic scientist after all.
Apollo:
(A self-styled one, at least.)
Examine evidence
Brooch
Back side
Apollo:
A sort of pin-fastener for attaching things to clothes. Not a safety pin-type, though.
Trucy:
So if it's not a safety pin... ...is it a danger pin!?
Apollo:
I suppose if you stuck it in your eye, then yeah, sure. But you could do that with a safety pin, too, for that matter.
Trucy:
...... Thanks for taking the fun out of my danger pin.
Apollo:
(Aw, you're driving a danger pin through my heart here.)
Revolver
Muzzle
Apollo:
Yikes! Don't point that thing at me!
Trucy:
Don't worry! I'm an old hand with firearms. I have one that shoots "Bullets".
Apollo:
I don't want it shooting any bullets, thank you!
Trucy:
Not those bullets, silly! My gun shoots "Bullets, the Magic Cat".
Apollo:
A cat... comes out of a gun?
Trucy:
I can tell your expression you've never heard of that trick. It's a great one!
Apollo:
(Honestly, That one sounds halfway interesting.)
Chamber
Apollo:
The middle of the weapon is a revolving chamber. That's where you load the bullets. A revolver, see?
Trucy:
Revolver... Revolver... That sounds a bit like "Wonder Bar"! Especially if you say it really fast!
Apollo:
Uh... I guess.
Trucy:
You know what I always used to think? I used to think the closest sound to "Wonder Bar" was "One Liver"! There's just so many words in the world, Apollo! Isn't it amazing!?
Apollo:
...... So many different words, so many different people. (...People like Trucy.)
Key Ring
Guitar-shaped key
Apollo:
There are three keys on this heart-shaped key ring. Hmm? This middle key is shaped like... a guitar?
Trucy:
I get it! It must be the key to a guitar case!
Apollo:
A guitar case key... (I'll bet I know who this belongs to.)
Trucy:
...... Thanks for taking the fun out of my danger pin.
Apollo:
(Aw, you're driving a danger pin through my heart here.)
After examining brooch, revolver, and LeTouse's right hand, and clearing all Talk options:
Ema:
Well, that's about it. I think we've looked at just about everything there is.
Apollo:
I guess you're right.
Ema:
I know how you're feeling. It is hard to know when to stop. But anything more involved has to wait until the squad gets here.
Trucy:
Argh... I suppose...
Ema:
I'll go report the evidence. Sorry, but could you wait here till I get back?
Apollo:
Huh? Oh, actually, we have to--
Ema:
Great! Thanks!
Apollo:
...She left.
Trucy:
What do we do, Apollo? She told us to wait...
Apollo:
Great. Now how am I supposed to investigate?
Trucy:
Oh well, I guess it can't be helped. Let's go.
Apollo:
Huh? Go?
Trucy:
Time's a wasting, Apollo! We've got a lot of ground to cover!
Apollo:
Well, that's true, but... ...On second thought, why not. I'm sure everything will be fine.
Trucy:
Of course it will! Let's go!
Examine
Air vent
Apollo:
...... That air vent bothers me. If Ema and I came in through the door... That makes that vent the only exit from the room.
Trucy:
But it's much too small.
Apollo:
Hmm... Not if the killer were about your size, Trucy...
Trucy:
......
Apollo:
......
Trucy:
I didn't do it!
Apollo:
Eh.
Trucy:
I was cutting up the dance floor at the time, thank you!
Apollo:
I know, I know! Of course I don't think you did it.
Trucy:
It's hard to tell with you, sometimes, Apollo.
Apollo:
(Hey! What have I done?)
Brooch
Trucy:
......
Apollo:
No snatching people's brooches.
Trucy:
Darn... Maybe there's another one lying around here somewhere.
Apollo:
If there is, you can't have that one either.
Trucy:
...Don't be so stingy, Apollo.
Apollo:
...I think the word you're looking for is "principled".
Bullet holes
Trucy:
Are these... bullet holes?
Apollo:
Looks like it. There are two here in the wall.
Trucy:
Well, if there are two marks, they must have missed twice.
Apollo:
Not necessarily... Some revolvers can put a bullet through a person. So it wasn't necessarily a miss.
Trucy:
Ouch... Sounds painful.
Fruit basket
Trucy:
Ooh! Apollo! Can I eat some of those, please!?
Apollo:
Better not. Ema will find out. Somehow, she will. "How could you eat those without telling me!?"
Trucy:
Yeah... I'll make sure to leave some for her to eat, too.
Apollo:
(I don't think that's the issue here...)
(Step)ladder
Apollo:
Huh, another ladder.
Trucy:
Actually, it's technically a stepladder.
Apollo:
Well hello, Ms. Fancy Pants! Please forgive my lack of ladder discrimination.
Trucy:
! ......
Apollo:
I'd say this ladder is used to climb up to reach things. ...Is there something on the ceiling?
Trucy:
I still say it's a stepladder.
Poster over TV
Apollo:
Look, there's another Gavinners poster. Ema didn't seem too happy about it.
Trucy:
Maybe I should take it down before she rips it up.
Apollo:
You walk around with that thing and she'll sniff it out.
Trucy:
...Maybe I'll pass then.
Apollo:
(It's probably wise to be wary of Ema...)
Speaker
Apollo:
That speaker was blaring when it happened. Apparently, it monitors sound from the main stage. ...Which made it hard to hear Mr. LeTouse's last words.
Trucy:
Well, you know what I do at loud concerts? I wear earplugs! It really cuts down on the noise.
Apollo:
...And this would have helped me hear him how?
Television
Trucy:
Ah, ah, Apollo! Look at that thing! It's huge! That... That's a TV!!!
Apollo:
Um, yeah, a wide flatscreen TV. I want one of those. Someday when I'm a famous attorney, I'll get one...
Trucy:
But Daddy never had one. I don't think he ever even had money when he was a lawyer.
Apollo:
Great, just stomp on my dreams why don't you.
Flower bouquet
Apollo:
What an amazing bouquet. I mean, it's giant.
Trucy:
That's super dazzle-frazzle!
Apollo:
..."Dazzle-frazzle"?
Trucy:
Yeah, it's super, and it makes you feel all dazzle-frazzle!
Apollo:
Um... Who taught you to say that?
Trucy:
Oh, Daddy.
Apollo:
(...I knew it.)
Hairdryer
Apollo:
This is one of those... uh, things, right? At the barbers? It's one of those permanent hair things.
Trucy:
I've never tried one.
Apollo:
Want to?
Trucy:
Hmm... I think I'll stick with my top hat. We have an understanding, me and my hat.
Apollo:
(It's... just a hat, Trucy.)
LeTouse's left hand
Apollo:
The body was holding a key ring...
Trucy:
Do you think it belongs to the killer?
Apollo:
If it's not Mr. LeTouse's, that seems like a possibility.
Mirror dresser
Apollo:
Seeing these mirrors lined up like that makes me think I'm really in a dressing room. Look at all that makeup.
Trucy:
Well, I haven't got a clue, and I doubt those are.
Apollo:
(I guess she's not into makeup yet.)
Presents
Apollo:
Look at all these presents. Lamiroir sure is popular.
Trucy:
I got a present once, from a person in the audience.
Apollo:
That's pretty cool.
Trucy:
Isn't it! Maybe you'll get one someday. ...From someone you defend!
Apollo:
(That's called getting paid, and I certainly hope I do.)
Revolver
Apollo:
A 45-caliber revolver, very powerful. This is definitely the murder weapon.
Trucy:
I wonder who brought this revolver in here? It's huge.
Apollo:
Someone unusual, that's for sure.
Trucy:
No one I want to meet, that's also for sure.
Apollo:
Me either. Unless it's in court, of course!
Small window
Trucy:
Look, there's a little window over here! Maybe the killer escaped through that!
Apollo:
It's only big enough to stick your head through. And it doesn't even open all the way.
Trucy:
...What? I was just saying it's possible.
Apollo:
Right, right, no harm in that. (Except I'm pretty sure it is impossible.)
July 7
Backstage Hallway
Trucy:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Apollo:
Who's there!?
Trucy:
We... didn't just imagine that, did we?
Apollo:
He was wearing a silk hat. ...Friend of yours?
Trucy:
Hardly!
Apollo:
(Whoever that was, he sure looked suspicious!)
July 7
In the Wings
Klavier:
What is it with today!? Problem after problem! Achtung!
???:
You ain't kidding.
Trucy:
It's the two leading members of the Gavinners, Apollo! Klavier on vocals, and Daryan on guitar! They're so cool!
Apollo:
I have a hard time thinking of "Klavier" as anything but a prosecutor, honestly.
Trucy:
Huh? What are they arguing about?
Apollo:
Probably the case, I'd bet.
Klavier:
My hog won't start. My guitar case is busted... ...my guitar's been burnt to a crisp, and to top it all off, someone's dead! ...And then there was that performance just now. What was that all about!?
Daryan:
Hey, man, don't blame me. You were the one who missed the cue.
Klavier:
Me? Miss a cue!? How could I conceivably get the most important part of that song wrong? How!? And what was all that tinny playing of yours?
Daryan:
Who you calling "tinny"!?
Trucy:
...Sounds like they're having a spat. One of those "differences in musical direction" bands are always splitting up over.
Apollo:
This is hardly the time...
Klavier:
...Hmm? What are you two doing here?
Apollo:
Ah, um, hiya. ......
Klavier:
We were just discussing the investigation, if you don't mind.
Apollo:
Sorry. Wait... You were what?
Klavier:
Listen... You need to confirm that with the Republic of Borginia, Detective Crescend.
Daryan:
Right. Anything else?
Apollo:
What did he just call him? "Detective...?
Daryan:
Ah, greetings. Daryan Crescend... Criminal Affairs, Division 3.
Apollo:
Uh... H-Hello. ("Criminal Affairs"!?)
Trucy:
*sigh* Apollo... You really don't know anything  about the Gavinners, do you?
Apollo:
(Something tells me that's about to be remedied.)
Talk
The case
Apollo:
Um, about the crime...
Klavier:
...Which crime do you mean?
Apollo:
The murder, what else!?
Klavier:
Oh, that. For me, today has been a hit parade of crimes, you see.
Trucy:
Prosecutor Gavin was singing the blues earlier, wasn't he? ...Something about his hog, and his guitar case.
Klavier:
...Anyway. I'm afraid you know more about the killing of Mr. LeTouse than I do. ...For now, at least.
Apollo:
Huh?
Klavier:
You were the one who found the body, ja? While we were in the middle of a performance, no less.
Trucy:
Aren't you going to examine the crime scene, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
I'll leave that to Fräulein Detective. Wouldn't want to step on her toes.
Trucy:
They're not exactly best buddies are they. Ema and Prosecutor Gavin, I mean.
Apollo:
Well, what to do next. We've already checked out the scene. (Prosecutor Gavin may be right. We might be the most informed, for once.)
Trucy:
Maybe Prosecutor Gavin can shed some light on things we've found!
The Gavinners
Trucy:
I don't believe you, Apollo! How can you come to this concert and not know about the Gavinners!?
Klavier:
It's not surprising. Why, even our ancestors knew nothing of America's existence once.
Apollo:
Um... I know America exists.
Trucy:
The Gavinners aren't just an average rock band, Apollo. Each member is connected to the police somehow!
Apollo:
The Police?
Trucy:
The real police! By day they pack heat, but by night they heat up the stage! By day those lips interrogate, by night they sing songs of unrequited passion!
Apollo:
...Um, OK.
Trucy:
They debuted seven years ago with "13 Years Hard Time For Love"... Then came "Love With No Chance Of Parole", and "My Boyfriend Is The Prosecution's Witness". The list of hits goes on and on!
Klavier:
This here's my right-hand man. ...Daryan Crescend. I make the melodies, and he attacks them with his guitar. He's a bit of a rogue, really.
Daryan:
Heh. And this guy's a bit of a perfectionist. When a performance goes the least bit wrong he goes into this funk... Just like today.
Apollo:
(I'd hope murder would be a bit more off-putting than a ruined concert...)
Klavier:
The concert today? A disaster! I'll get to the bottom of this and then we'll see who missed a cue!
Trucy:
The missed cue... They were arguing about that before...
Apollo:
(Great, I love nothing more than questioning tormented artists.)
The missed cue (appears after "The Gavinners")
Trucy:
What's this missed cue you keep talking about?
Klavier:
Ah ha, you heard it, didn't you? From the audience?
Trucy:
Um, actually, I didn't notice anything...
Daryan:
See! No amateur is going to pick up on that!
Klavier:
Can you guarantee an entire audience of amateurs? No! Now take a listen to this!
Trucy:
What's that...?
Klavier:
A mixing board. We used it to record our concert tonight.
Apollo:
(Aren't we supposed to be investigating a murder...?)
Trucy:
Well, we've come this far, might as well go all the way! I've always wanted to learn about the recording industry!
Klavier:
This is but one of the devices used in recordings. We're a five-part band... This lets us record each member's performance separately. You use the sliders to adjust the volume for each part. Check it out!
Trucy:
Wow, neat! So, could you, say, hear only the drum part?
Klavier:
Of course. That's how we'll find the criminal guilty of missing his cue tonight!
Apollo:
I'm more concerned with the other criminal. The one who kills people.
Klavier:
You want help on the case? Then help me with mine!
Apollo:
(I guess rock 'n' roll comes before prosecuting.)
Klavier:
Let's begin! First, we bring up the part of the performance in question. You simply choose the section of the song you wish to hear on the bottom-most bar. Like so. There it is. Now, listen.
Trucy:
...Was something wrong?
Klavier:
You couldn't hear it? Listen again, closely...
Trucy:
Ah... the timing's a little off, isn't it!?
Klavier:
You see? There! Right at the most important part! And even an amateur can hear it!
Daryan:
An amateur with a mixing board, maybe.
Klavier:
You're missing the point! We'll never stamp out crime until we're perfect. Perfect!
Daryan:
Here he goes again...
Klavier:
Right. Herr Amateur, you will prove my point.
Apollo:
Huh? Me!?
Klavier:
You will find the missed cue! You will tell us which instrument, which part, is the guilty party!
Apollo:
But how...?
Klavier:
Did I not just explain it? Use these sliders to adjust the volume for each part. Then you will find the part that hopelessly bungles the cue! You'll find it, with your untrained amateur ears!
Trucy:
Nothing to do but try, Apollo!
Apollo:
(I guess... I'll admit, this looks kind of fun.)
Klavier:
First, a quick review: use the sliders to adjust volumes. Press the section of the song you wish to hear on the bottom bar.
Apollo:
(Sliders and the bar, got it.)
Klavier:
Once you've found the guilty part, press the corresponding number! Time to rock!
Present track 2
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This part is off."
Present any other tracks
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
This part sounds a little off.
Klavier:
Let's see............... ...Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
Yes?
Klavier:
Let me guess... ...You got a D in high school chorus, didn't you?
Apollo:
(How'd he know!?)
Klavier:
This part is perfection. Absolute perfection. I'd bet all the royalties from my last platinum-selling album on it. The guilty part is elsewhere.
Apollo:
(Yeah, yeah, I know you sold a bazillion records.)
Trucy:
Focus, Apollo! I'll cheer you on!
Apollo:
Actually, it's probably better if you stay quiet... (Let's give this another shot.)
Leads back to track selection
Apollo:
This part is off.
Klavier:
Which is that? Hmm... 2nd Guitar.
Daryan:
Ah.
Klavier:
It was you Daryan!
Daryan:
...... Ah well, looks like the cat's out of the bag.
Klavier:
"Ah well"? That's all you have to say!? That kind of attitude lets killers walk free, Daryan!
Trucy:
Here they go again.
Apollo:
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to ask about the concert. It's starting to feel like we're just wasting time.
Trucy:
It's all experience under our belts! That can't be bad!
Mixing Board added to the Court Record.
Apollo:
(I still can't get over the title for that song... ..."Guilty Love"...?)
The missed cue (subsequent times)
Apollo:
(Best to avoid bringing up that topic again... I'm sure I can think of something else to ask about.)
Gavin's troubles (appears after presenting Key Ring)
Apollo:
You were saying something about your motorcycle not starting?
Trucy:
And something about your guitar case being busted?
Klavier:
...You're well informed.
Trucy:
You mentioned it a few times.
Klavier:
Ach. Ach! It all happened this morning. It's all this key ring's fault.
Apollo:
The key ring...
Klavier:
It's got all my keys on it, ja? My bike key, my car key... and the key to my guitar case.
Trucy:
Wait, so this key ring...
Klavier:
...It disappeared. I thought I'd put it in my jacket pocket...
Apollo:
(Prosecutor Gavin's key ring... disappeared?)
Klavier:
I had to come to the concert by taxi. How embarrassing! And in order to get my guitar out, I had to break the lock.
Apollo:
Wait, this guitar wasn't the one that...
Klavier:
The very one. Up in flames... ...And right on stage, too.
Trucy:
I actually thought that was part of the show.
Klavier:
Crazy. ...And to top it off, Mr. LeTouse's life was taken. Nobody told me 'bout days like these.
Apollo:
Strange days, indeed.
Klavier:
...You think?
Trucy:
......
Apollo:
What's wrong, Trucy?
Trucy:
Well, I was just trying to make sense of everything. First this heart-shaped key ring gets stolen. Then a very expensive guitar flares up on stage. Then Mr. LeTouse dies...
Klavier:
Yes, and...?
Trucy:
Could it all really be just a coincidence?
Klavier:
Coincidence...? Meaning...? Daryan, can you make any sense of all this?
Daryan:
...Hey, don't look at me.
Trucy:
What do you think, Apollo?
Apollo:
Huh?
Trucy:
I mean, either Mr. Gavin's having a really bad day... ...or all this was planned.
Klavier:
...... You... aren't thinking what I think you're thinking... ...are you, Fräulein?
Trucy:
I am!
Daryan:
What? What!? Hey, don't leave me in the dark with Spike, here.
Apollo:
(...The name's Apollo, but yeah, I agree... Don't leave us in the dark! What are you talking about?)
Trucy:
Haven't you noticed a connection, Apollo? ...A curious connection between all of Mr. Gavin's troubles today?
Apollo:
Um, well...
I have noticed
Apollo:
You know, something was bugging me, too! That key ring, and the guitar, and the body...
Trucy:
Slow down there, Polly. You look a wee bit dizzy.
Daryan:
He's bluffing. He hasn't figured it out. Fess up, if you're a man. You're as clueless as I am!
Apollo:
Huh?
Klavier:
No, no, give Herr Forehead a chance. Let's see your evidence of the connection, shall we?
Apollo:
E-Evidence!? (Ack! I'd better think of something pronto!)
Trucy:
C'mon c'mon c'mon! Let's see it! What's the connection between all of Mr. Gavin's troubles?
Present Lyrics Sheet
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It's this, isn't it?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
The connection... is this! Right?
Trucy:
Um, I would say you were close, but really, you're kinda far. Remote, even.
Apollo:
(Oops. Try not to anger the Trucy, Apollo. No sudden motions... Just find that evidence slowly.)
Leads back to:
"C'mon c'mon c'mon! Let's see it!"
Apollo:
It's this, isn't it?
Leads to:
"A lyrics sheet? ..."The Guitar's Serenade"...? What's that got to do with anything?"
I haven't noticed
Trucy:
You haven't!?
Apollo:
...I just don't see the connection. Sorry.
Trucy:
Well don't just give up! Give it a little more thought!
Apollo:
Wait... You don't mean this, do you?
Leads to:
"A lyrics sheet? ..."The Guitar's Serenade"...? What's that got to do with anything?"
Daryan:
A lyrics sheet? ..."The Guitar's Serenade"...? What's that got to do with anything?
Klavier:
It has everything to do with everything. Though I wouldn't have believed it if the Fräulein hadn't pointed it out.
Daryan:
What are you talking about, man? Enough with the riddles!
Klavier:
Maybe it is a coincidence, or perhaps it means something. Don't you think, Fräulein?
Trucy:
I do. Everything that's happened to Mr. Gavin today... ...is predicted in the lyrics to this song!
Daryan:
Wh-Whaaat!? No way!
The song's prediction (appears after "Gavin's troubles")
Trucy:
Look, just think about everything that's happened to Mr. Gavin. Let's list them in the order that they occurred... ...while reading this lyrics sheet!
Apollo:
First, the key ring was stolen.
Trucy:
And not just any key ring! A heart-shaped key ring!
Apollo:
That's right here! "When you stole away the keys my heart held on to so tight." This is a "heart" holding "keys"!
Trucy:
And next, his guitar burst into flame.
Apollo:
"Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away..."
Trucy:
And then Mr. LeTouse was killed...
Apollo:
"Like a bullet of love. Fire. Take my life away..." But... But that's crazy!
Trucy:
Yeah, no kidding!
Daryan:
So everything that happened today, here... ...This song predicted it all?
Klavier:
Or perhaps it was the other way around...
Apollo:
Huh?
Klavier:
The criminal could have based his crime on the lyrics.
Apollo:
But who would go through all that trouble...?
Klavier:
Someone who moves in mysterious ways, no doubt. I believe you've stumbled upon something quite vital... and quite annoying, Fräulein.
Trucy:
Eh heh.
Apollo:
(She looks pleased...)
Present
Key Ring
Apollo:
Um, I was wondering if you knew anything about this?
Klavier:
Th-That...!
Apollo:
Does it look familiar?
Klavier:
Familiar! It's mine! That's my key ring! I've been looking all over for it!
Trucy:
Whaaaaaat!? This is yours, Mr. Gavin!?
Apollo:
(I knew it...)
Trucy:
Apollo! How can you make that "I knew it" face!? This is the key ring that was...
Apollo:
Yeah, I know.
Klavier:
Thanks, anyway. So, where did you find it?
Apollo:
Erm, actually, the victim was holding it. Like he was trying to keep it from the killer. Even if it meant his life.
Klavier:
...... Wh-Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? The victim... you mean, Mr. LeTouse had my keys?
Apollo:
Indeed.
Klavier:
Hrmm... When will my trials be over?
Trucy:
Speaking of trials, I've never heard Mr. Gavin whine in court like he has been today.
Apollo:
Ema was right about the fop, I'll give her that.
Trucy:
Apollo! Mr. Gavin, maybe we can help. Tell us about your troubles today.
Klavier:
I really don't think that's...
Trucy:
Tell us... ...and we'll keep mum about the key ring for now.
Klavier:
Are... you blackmailing me, Fräulein?
Key Ring (subsequent times)
Klavier:
Anyway... Thanks for finding this. If you'd found it under different circumstances, I'd be even happier.
Trucy:
I wonder why Mr. LeTouse was holding it?
Apollo:
Maybe he was trying to tell us something? Maybe that Prosecutor Gavin is the killer?
Klavier:
Herr Forehead, save your wild accusations for the court. I do so enjoy the penalties.
Anything else
Klavier:
Sorry, but I'm not in the mood to talk about that right now. Even I can only take so much in one day.
Apollo:
(Funny, I always thought of Prosecutor Gavin as one of those cool, stoic types. The sort that never complains. How wrong I was!)
After clearing "The missed cue" and "The song's prediction" Talk options:
Daryan:
The lyrics predicting the crime... Klavier?
Klavier:
Seems a bit more than just a coincidence to me.
Daryan:
I have to agree. The key ring, the guitar, and the murder...
Apollo:
The key ring might have been dropped by accident.
Klavier:
Yet the victim was holding it. Hard to think that it was unconnected.
Apollo:
That's true. (Prosecutor Gavin's as calm and collected as ever...)
Trucy:
So the criminal matched their actions to the lyrics?
Daryan:
That sounds likely.
Apollo:
Why would anyone do that?
Daryan:
...While we think about that, I'm going to get cracking on the biggest crime here. I'm going to talk to the Borginian Embassy about this Mr. LeTouse.
Klavier:
Ah, right. Thanks, Daryan.
Daryan:
I'll leave the pondering of mysteries to you. I'm outta here.
Klavier:
A foreign national, Mr. LeTouse was killed... It seems like that would have to be the "point" of all this. But they did more than that. They left us with not only a murder, but a mystery!
Trucy:
Mr. Gavin sure is irritable today.
Apollo:
Maybe this is the real Prosecutor Gavin we don't get to see in the courtroom.
Klavier:
...I've had enough, frankly. If you find any more mysteries, do me a favor and keep them to yourselves, ja?
Apollo:
Ja... (I guess this is all we're going to get from Prosecutor Gavin. That leaves Lamiroir to question.) Prosecutor Gavin... do you know where Lamiroir is now?
Klavier:
Ah, I had her go to my dressing room. With that pianist, Machi Tobaye, of course. She seemed rather shocked by Mr. LeTouse's sudden passing.
Apollo:
(The Gavinners's dressing room. Got it!)
Talk
The Gavinners
Trucy:
I don't believe you, Apollo! How can you come to this concert and not know about the Gavinners!?
Klavier:
It's not surprising. Why, even our ancestors knew nothing of America's existence once.
Apollo:
Um... I know America exists.
Trucy:
The Gavinners aren't just an average rock band, Apollo. Each member is connected to the police somehow!
Apollo:
The Police?
Trucy:
The real police! By day they pack heat, but by night they heat up the stage! By day those lips interrogate, by night they sing songs of unrequited passion!
Apollo:
...Um, OK.
The song's prediction
Trucy:
Look, just think about everything that's happened to Mr. Gavin. Let's list them in the order that they occurred... ...while reading this lyrics sheet!

So this song prerdicted everything that was going to happen!?

Huh?
Klavier:
The criminal could have based his crime on the lyrics.

July 7
Backstage Hallway
Trucy:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Apollo:
Who's there!? ...There he goes again. Who is that guy!?
Trucy:
......
Apollo:
Huh? Trucy?
Trucy:
You know, he did look sort of familiar...
Apollo:
...So he is a friend of yours!
Trucy:
No, that's not it. ...Sorry, I don't remember.
Apollo:
(Curiouser and curiouser...)
Examine evidence
Guitar shaped key on Key Ring
Apollo:
There are three keys on this heart-shaped key ring. And this guitar-shaped key was the key to a guitar case.
Trucy:
Wasn't he saying he had to break his case because he couldn't get it unlocked? I could open a lock like that in 10 seconds, easy! He should have given me a call.
Apollo:
...So he could slap handcuffs on you after you opened it?
Trucy:
Handcuffs? 20 seconds, tops!
Apollo:
(I'm glad she's on my side.)
July 7
Gavinners's Dressing Room
Trucy:
Ah... Lamiroir!
Lamiroir:
What... What has happened? I heard that Mr. LeTouse has died!
Apollo:
L-Lamiroir! You speak? I mean, you speak English?
Lamiroir:
Ah... Yes. I was invited here from the Republic of Borginia... But I am not Borginian by birth.
Trucy:
But wasn't Mr. LeTouse your interpreter...?
Lamiroir:
Ah that. Yes, well... It was Mr. LeTouse's idea. He thought it would add to the mystery, you see.
Apollo:
Then, your pianist is also...?
Machi:
....................
Lamiroir:
No, Machi Tobaye is Borginian. He does not speak English. Now, please tell me! What has happened to Mr. LeTouse? Why did he...
Trucy:
Actually, Mr. LeTouse was...
Apollo:
Trucy!
Trucy:
Huh!
Apollo:
Remember what Prosecutor Gavin said? "Not a word"!
Trucy:
B-But Mr. LeTouse is Lamiroir's manager! That's not fair to her! I mean, isn't she a related party?
Apollo:
(Precisely who Prosecutor Gavin doesn't want to alert, I'd suspect.)
Lamiroir:
All we have been told is to wait here in this room. It is very unsettling.
Apollo:
I'm sorry, we're trying to figure it out ourselves. Do... you think I could ask you some questions?
Lamiroir:
Of course. I am always willing to help.
Apollo:
(She's as calm as she looked on stage... I can't put my finger on why, but I like this Lamiroir.)
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]....
Lamiroir:
What is it, Machi?
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]....
Lamiroir:
What... but you'd be alone!
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]....
Apollo:
Um, what seems to be the problem?
Lamiroir:
Machi... he is not good around strangers. He wishes to go out for a breath of fresh air. Would that be alright?
Apollo:
Uh, sure, of course.
Machi:
....................
Lamiroir:
Very well. What is it you wished to ask me about?
Examine
Postcard
Trucy:
Look! It's a postcard of Lamiroir!
Apollo:
What are these letters at the bottom? I've never seen these before.
Trucy:
It must be her native tongue, Borginese!
Lamiroir:
"A landscape painter in sound"... This is how it would translate, roughly. Please, take one.
Apollo:
("A landscape painter in sound"...? That's a nice image...)
Postcard added to the Court Record.
Postcard (subsequent times)
Lamiroir:
You see the words written upon the postcard? They say "a landscape painter in sound".
Apollo:
("A landscape painter in sound"...? That's a nice image...)
Talk
Lamiroir
Apollo:
The Republic of Borginia... that's in Northern Europe, right?
Trucy:
I've never even heard of it...
Lamiroir:
I started out singing in a restaurant... Then a producer called me. Before I knew it... here I am.
Trucy:
You don't say! You know, my daddy plays piano in a restaurant!
Apollo:
Producers tend to look for talent, Trucy. ...Lamiroir, you're not from Borginia originally? Were you born here?
Lamiroir:
Well...
Apollo:
Oh, is that supposed to be a secret?
Trucy:
Image is everything when you're a star! I know a bit about that, of course...
Lamiroir:
Ah, yes, it is something like this. A contract, you might say. I'm also not to speak anything but Borginese in public.
Apollo:
Image is important, I guess.
Trucy:
She's not all image, though! Her songs are lovely! A real "landscape painter in sound"!
Apollo:
A painter in what?
Trucy:
She travels the world, turning the sights she sees into music! That's the secret to your music's beauty, right?
Lamiroir:
You're very perceptive.
Trucy:
Oh, I use your songs all the time in my stage act. ...I don't have to pay royalties for that, do I?
Apollo:
Stop while you're ahead, Trucy.
Lamiroir:
This "landscape painter in sound", too, is an image. Yet without it, my songs would not be so widely heard.
Trucy:
They even call you the "Siren of the Ballad", right?
Lamiroir:
Yes. In Borginese, "Lamiroir" means "the Siren". I fear that, perhaps, already I am not the siren I once was.
Machi
Trucy:
Your pianist... Machi, was it? He's cute! Like a porcelain doll...
Apollo:
He's very "European".
Lamiroir:
I met him while singing in restaurants in Borginia. He is an orphan... yet his playing is exquisite. Soon he came to live with me.
Trucy:
It's like a fairy tale, almost...
Apollo:
I noticed he hardly leaves your side.
Lamiroir:
Yes, well, he is blind. At first, I hesitated at dragging him across the world.
Apollo:
He doesn't speak English, either, does he?
Lamiroir:
He had never left Borginia before we met. I made his presence part of  my contract. Machi and I together are "Lamiroir". Together, always.
Mr. LeTouse
Lamiroir:
Mr. LeTouse... was my new manager.
Apollo:
New?
Lamiroir:
Yes, from three months ago. Around when I received Mr. Gavin's invitation to come. I met Mr. LeTouse at my office. He was to be my manager and bodyguard... And, as it turned out, my interpreter.
Apollo:
Interpreter... even though you speak English.
Lamiroir:
Yes... but we were to visit more places than just here. We had a concert in Japan scheduled after this one. Though I fear that may have to be cancelled now...
Trucy:
Was Mr. LeTouse from the Republic of Borginia, too?
Lamiroir:
Well... he was only with me for three months. I'm afraid there is much I do not know about him. And now, I shall never know. No one will even tell me why he has died.
Apollo:
I-I'm sorry... Prosecutor Gavin said we weren't to talk to anyone...
Lamiroir:
Mr. LeTouse... was a talented man. The "Siren of the Ballad"... That phrase was his idea, you know. I am happy for him that it has become so well known.
After clearing "Lamiroir" and "Mr. LeTouse" Talk options:
Apollo:
The "siren"... That's what he meant!
Trucy:
Huh? Apollo?
Apollo:
You are "the Siren", right Lamiroir?
Lamiroir:
That is the meaning of my name in Borginese, yes. It was the name my producer gave me. But why do you ask?
Apollo:
...It's very important. I had to know for sure if the "Siren" was you.
Lamiroir:
What do you mean, important?
Apollo:
...I'll tell you. You deserve to know.
Talk
The "Siren"
Apollo:
"Siren"... It turns out that's a very important word in this case.
Trucy:
H-How?
Apollo:
When we found Mr. LeTouse... ...he was still alive.
Lamiroir:
What...?
Apollo:
I heard him say something... ...his last words.
Apollo:
Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?
LeTouse:
Ask... wi...witness...
Apollo:
Hang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?
LeTouse:
The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...
Trucy:
He said "siren"... Really?
Apollo:
I was the only one there to hear it... ...but I'm sure that's what he said!
Lamiroir:
Mr. LeTouse said that!? "Ask the witness"...?
Apollo:
And you're the Siren, Lamiroir.
Lamiroir:
......
Apollo:
Did you see what happened?
Lamiroir:
......
Present
Brooch
Apollo:
That reminds me... Does this brooch look familiar to you?
Lamiroir:
My brooch... yes! Well... It may be mine.
Apollo:
Yours, Lamiroir...?
Lamiroir:
I was wearing a brooch earlier, you see. I must have lost it.
Trucy:
Well that explains the brooch we found. It was Lamiroir's!
Lamiroir:
Thank you. I was wondering where I'd dropped it.
Apollo:
(So this brooch belongs to her... That begs the question...)
Trucy:
Is something wrong, Apollo?
Apollo:
(...What was this brooch doing at the crime scene?)
Brooch (subsequent times)
Lamiroir:
I believe that brooch is mine, yes. ... I was wondering where I had dropped it.
Apollo:
(So it's Lamiroir's brooch, which begs the question... ...what was it doing at the crime scene?)
Anything else
Apollo:
Would you mind taking a look at this, Lamiroir?
Lamiroir:
...... I'm sorry, I'm not sure what to say. I wish I could help you.
Apollo:
Ah, don't worry about it. (Certainly one of the most pleasant refusals I've had.)
After clearing "The "Siren"" Talk option:
Apollo:
Lamiroir...?
Lamiroir:
Might I ask, are you with the police?
Apollo:
Eh! Uh, well, no. I'm a defense attorney.
Lamiroir:
An attorney? Yet there have been no arrests, yes?
Apollo:
...Is that a problem?
Lamiroir:
Does an attorney not work for a "client"? If you have no client, you should leave the investigation to the police, I think.
Trucy:
But Lamiroir, we...
Lamiroir:
I am sorry, but I cannot answer your questions. I'm afraid you lack the authority to ask them.
Apollo:
Ack... (Why...? If she witnessed the crime, why won't she tell us...?)
Lamiroir:
I believe we are through here.
Apollo:
...I believe so.
After examining postcard, clearing "The "Siren"" Talk option, and presenting Brooch in Gavinners Dressing Room:
July 8, 12:22 AM
Backstage Hallway
Apollo:
Whoa! Who's there now!?
Ema:
Ah, it's you. ...Where were you!?
Apollo:
Ack! Ema! ...Is something wrong? (She's looks grumpier than usual.)
Ema:
You bet something's wrong! The impossible's happened! Arrgh! It's all your fault, you know!
Apollo:
(Oops. Maybe this is about us leaving the crime scene.)
Trucy:
What do you mean by "impossible"?
Ema:
Well it's gone! Utterly gone!
Trucy:
...What's gone?
Ema:
The body, stupid! What else?
Trucy:
Eh...
Ema:
Mr. LeTouse's body has disappeared!
Trucy:
Whaaaaaaaaaat!?
July 8
Lamiroir's Dressing Room
Apollo:
Ah... Prosecutor Gavin.
Klavier:
From your vacant stare, I gather you've heard the news.
Apollo:
I heard Mr. LeTouse's body has gone missing...
Klavier:
Look for yourself. Quite the pickle. Quite. The. Pickle.
Ema:
How can you just stand there!? We have to start the investi...
Klavier:
There's no need for alarm, Fräulein Detective.
Ema:
...!
Klavier:
All entrances and exits have been sealed. The body will not leave the building. So, I suggest we go find ourselves a cadaver. There will be plenty of time to ponder the "whys" later.
Trucy:
Well, you seem pretty sure of yourself, Mr. Gavin.
Klavier:
Oh, we'll find him. I'm rather enjoying this.
Apollo:
(How could Mr. LeTouse's body just "disappear"?)
Trucy:
Well, you heard the man. Let's get searching!
Daryan:
...Hey, I don't know if this's exactly the right time, but...
Klavier:
Yes, Daryan?
Daryan:
See, Geeter's gone missing. It was in the dressing room.
Trucy:
Geeter? Who's Geeter!?
Daryan:
That's what I call my guitar! You like, man?
Klavier:
Your guitar... was stolen?
Ema:
This hasn't been a good day for guitars or geeters.
Klavier:
OK. Body first, then guitar. And if someone finds that guitar, please bring it to our dressing room.
Daryan:
Geeter's like a missing person, not lost 'n' found,  man.
Examine
Floor
Apollo:
There should be a body here. But there's not. How could this have happened? And why?
Talk
Disappearing act
Ema:
Well, this sure is a... what did he call it? A sausage? No wait, it was a pickle. And it's your pickle! I told you to stay in the room!
Apollo:
...Sorry. (Not much else I can say.)
Ema:
...It's alright. Top priority now is finding that body. ...You can make it up to me later. Ten bags or so of chocolate Snackoos should do the trick nicely.
Apollo:
(You should watch your sugar intake, Ema.)
Present
Anything
Apollo:
Ema, could you take a look at this?
Ema:
Just hold it right there. This is not time to be waving a bag of Snackoos in my face!
Apollo:
Um, it's not a bag of Snackoos.
Ema:
Look. What's important is that Mr. LeTouse's body is missing! And we've got to find it!
Apollo:
(She would be more convincing if she wasn't standing around eating her precious Snackoos.)
July 8, 12:57 AM
In the Wings
Trucy:
Hmm. Does something seem different to you, Apollo?
Apollo:
Something is definitely different here.
Trucy:
Let's check it out!
Examine
Stage tower
Leads to:
"That stage there must have been lowered before."
Anywhere else
Trucy:
I'm not sure that's all that important right now. Let's check out that thing in the middle of the stage!
Trucy:
That stage there must have been lowered before.
Apollo:
That's the tower that Lamiroir and Prosecutor Gavin were singing on.
Trucy:
Someone must have raised it. Hmm. I don't see a way to control it from here. Apollo, what about that ladder there against the wall? We could use that to take a look up top...
Apollo:
...... Maybe we should get Ema.
Trucy:
What are you talking about? We have to see this sort of thing for ourselves!
Apollo:
(I'm... not so good with heights.)
Trucy:
Stop whining and start climbing!
Apollo:
Urk...
Apollo:
(It didn't look that high from below, really. But when we got to the top, I felt every one of those 20 feet down. Of course, I wasn't thinking about the height any more. Not after what we found up there.)
Trucy:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Apollo:
(We found two things we were looking for, and one thing we never expected to find.) ...The body, guitar in hand, and the pianist, Machi Tobaye.
July 8, 10:09 AM
Wright Anything Agency
Apollo:
Wow, that concert last night sure went south in a hurry!
Trucy:
No kidding. Why did they arrest Machi!? Why!?
Apollo:
Don't look at me like it's my fault! (Machi Tobaye, the blind pianist... ...arrested on suspicion of murdering Romein LeTouse.)
Trucy:
I can't believe such a cute little boy could do something so horrible!
Apollo:
I guess they had proof of some kind.
Trucy:
What proof could possibly prove that!?
Klavier:
Mornin'.
Apollo:
P-Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
What a night, eh? I apologize for being so upset...
Trucy:
Mr. Gavin, do you know what's going on? Why did they arrest Machi!? Why!?
Apollo:
Don't look at him like it's his fault either.
Klavier:
It was tough for me, too. We performed together that night, after all. Yet...
Trucy:
Yet?
Klavier:
The powers that be say that, given the circumstances, it could only have been him.
Apollo:
What do you mean by the "circumstances"?
Klavier:
Lamiroir was invited from Borginia as an ambassador of goodwill. It is vital that this case be wrapped up swiftly. That's all the powers that be want, really.
Apollo:
Well those are circumstances, alright. But what makes Machi the only possible suspect?
Klavier:
Herr Forehead... You seem to have forgotten that you're talking to the prosecution... the enemy.
Apollo:
Ah. Right. (I think I like this side of Prosecutor Gavin better, actually.)
Klavier:
I'm not at liberty to discuss the particulars of the case. ...Especially not to the defense attorney.
Apollo:
What... did you just say? Me? The defense attorney?
Klavier:
That's what I came to tell you. He's down at the detention center... He wants to request your services.
Apollo:
He...? You mean Machi? Machi wants me...?
Trucy:
This is what we've been waiting for, Apollo! Let's get going!
Apollo:
Uh... Right...!
Klavier:
Good luck. I'm off to question Lamiroir.
Apollo:
R-Right. Later! (I hope I'm up to this...)
July 8
Detention Center
Visitor's Room
Trucy:
Well, I just don't get it. I refuse to believe a cute little kid like that could do something so terrible.
Apollo:
...You said that already.
Machi:
...........................
Trucy:
Machi! Everything's going to be OK! We're here for you!
Apollo:
Um, h-hi. Maybe you can tell me about last night...
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]....
Trucy:
Huh?
Machi:
[Borginese speaking].... [Borginese speaking]!
Apollo:
(That was when I realized how tough it must be... A little kid like this... ...in a country so far from everything he's ever known.)
Trucy:
Um, maybe Lamiroir can help?
Apollo:
But didn't Prosecutor Gavin say she was with him?
Klavier:
Good luck. I'm off to question Lamiroir.
Trucy:
Well, what are we going to do?
Apollo:
That's, um, a good question. (I can't think of anything we can do but go with this. ...And hope for the best at the trial tomorrow.)
Machi:
[Borginese speaking].... [Borginese speaking]....
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Apollo:
No clues here.
