February 24, 9:41 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Ema:
So, what do you think, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I think the prosecution is as confused as we are. After all...
Lana:
the victim was murdered in two different places at the same time, and a different suspect was arrested at the other crime scene.
Ema:
Lana!
Lana:
Good morning, Mr. Wright. I apologize for yesterday. I was... indisposed.
Phoenix:
I hope they didn't hold you too long for questioning.
Lana:
We just finished, actually. I'm used to all-nighters, though.
Ema:
So, how'd it go?
Lana:
It's as Mr. Wright suspects. The police are clueless. I figured as much, so I struck a plea bargain.
Ema:
A plea bargain? What do you mean by that?
Lana:
We agreed that if I told them the truth behind this "simultaneous murder," they wouldn't seek capital punishment. That's what I mean, Ema.
Ema:
But Lana! Don't tell me you...
Lana:
Much to my regret, I'm as much in the dark about this as they are.
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye.
Lana:
Hmm?
Phoenix:
We discovered traces left by a certain person in the Police Department's evidence room. They belonged to Officer Jake Marshall.
Lana:
You found Officer Marshall's... traces?
Phoenix:
Blood-stained fingerprints, to be exact.
Lana:!
Phoenix:
That's the trump card I have up my sleeve today. You do understand what this means, don't you?
Ema:
In order to defend my sister, you're going to accuse Mr. Marshall?
Phoenix:
We have to play the cards we're dealt. Isn't that right, Ms. Skye?
Lana:
... Do what you have to do, Mr. Wright.
February 24, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is... Hmph.
Judge:
... Hmph? I'm afraid you'll have to clarify.
Edgeworth:
It takes 30 minutes by car to reach criminal affairs from the Prosecutor's Office. The victim, Bruce Goodman, was slain at both places at the same time.
Judge:
But, that's not physically possible, is it? What's more, I hear the victim from the evidence room just "disappeared"!
Ema:
Yes, and the body eventually reappeared in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car.
Phoenix:
(Wow... this is one messed up trial...)
Edgeworth:
One of my duties as prosecutor is to present impartial evidence. Today I will present evidence relating to the murder at the Police Department. In so doing, I believe the way in which we should proceed will reveal itself.
Ema:
Now that's what sets Mr. Edgeworth apart. He sounds so on top of things... even though he doesn't know what's going on himself!
Phoenix:
And that's supposed to be an admirable trait?
Judge:
Very well, let the trial resume. On the day of the crime, what exactly transpired at the Police Department? Mr. Edgeworth, you may call your first witness of the day to the stand.
Edgeworth:
For its first witness, the prosecution calls... the suspect of the murder that occurred at the Police Department!
Judge:
The suspect!? You mean, the so-called murderer!?
Phoenix:
(Hoo boy. Things are getting wild from the get-go.)
Edgeworth:
Will the witness please state his name and occupation.
Meekins:
Yes, sir! I am Officer Mike Meekins, sir! My occupation is, um... that would be murderer, sir!
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
... Er... So you're telling us you're a "professional killer"...
Meekins:
Sir. It was me, sir! I'm the one who did it! I'll never kill anyone again, sir! You've got to believe me, sir!
Judge:
Uh... Actually, what we'd like to hear from you is...
Meekins:
Sir! I'm what you would call part of the "younger generation," sir! A person whose actions adults can't possibly comprehend!
Judge:
Please, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Help me, sir!
Edgeworth:
Officer Meekins.
Meekins:
Y-yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
Give us your report of the crime. Consider that an order.
Meekins:
Yes, sir! As you wish! After all, I am part of a generation that must be told what to do, sir!
Ema:
You can't fault him for a lack of enthusiasm.
Witness Testimony
-- Crime Report, Sir! --
Meekins:
Although it's not my normal duty, I was assigned to guard the evidence room that day!
I spotted a suspicious man on the security screen, and rushed into the room!
I was only doing what I was trained to do, sir!
I was suddenly attacked!
I fought for my life! Then I... I did it!
After that I passed out... until another officer smacked me awake!
Judge:
Hmm. So the victim, Detective Goodman, attacked you?
Meekins:
"Do unto others before they do unto you"! That's the Meekins family motto, sir!
Judge:
I see. Then you fainted, and a colleague helped you regain consciousness.
Meekins:
Yes, sir! He knocked me upside the head, sir!
Judge:
Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination.
Phoenix:
(What I need here is more info to work with!)
Cross Examination
-- Crime Report, Sir! --
Meekins:
Although it's not my normal duty, I was assigned to guard the evidence room that day!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Mr. Meekins. You work in the General Affairs Department, do you not?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! I am in charge of hiring new recruits, sir!
Phoenix:
(Yikes! Now there's a scary thought.)
Edgeworth:
Evidence transferal was taking place on the day of the crime, which meant many officers were given special tasks not ordinarily performed.
Meekins:
I was in charge of guarding the Blue Badger, sir!
Judge:
The Blue Badger?
Meekins:
Yes, sir. The lovely police mascot created by the Head Detective, sir! I was to ensure it wasn't broken during the transferal process. That was my sole mission for the day, sir!
Judge:
I see. Sounds like a very... uh, important mission.
Meekins:
After the awards ceremony finished that day, there were so many people running around that I relocated the Blue Badger to the evidence room!
Judge:
Oh... So that's why you went to the evidence room.
Edgeworth:
Tell us... what did you see when you got there?
Meekins:
I spotted a suspicious man on the security screen, and rushed into the room!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
In order to enter the evidence room... you need an ID card, am I correct?
Meekins:
Precisely, sir! I have one right here around my neck!
Phoenix:
So then... your ID number should be listed in here, right?
Meekins:
... There it is! I found it! This is the one right here.
Judge:
Could you please read us the number?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! It's "4989596." That's my number, sir!
Phoenix:
I see... Huh? But the number 4989596... is shown as being used twice!
Edgeworth:
Please explain, witness.
Meekins:
It's n-no real mystery, sir! The first time is when I relocated Blue Badger to the evidence room, and the second time is when I went to go get him after everything settled down.
Judge:
I see. So it was during that second time when?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! That was when I spotted the man on the security screen!
Data added to ID Card Record.
Meekins:
I was only doing what I was trained to do, sir! I was suddenly attacked!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you were attacked... Can you please tell us exactly what happened to you?
Meekins:
It was a knife, sir! A knife!
Judge:
Detective Goodman pulled a knife on you? What happened then?
Meekins:
Well, with me charging in on him like that, he looked as surprised as I was!
Phoenix:
(You aren't exactly the kind of person someone would want to run into...)
Meekins:
That's when I reacted, sir! I swung my arms like an octopus, struggling to detain him! That's how I got this gash on my hand.
Ema:
Maybe if you'd just kept your cool your hand wouldn't be...
Meekins:
When I saw the blood trickling down my arm, I panicked! I grabbed the man by his collar!
Meekins:
I fought for my life! Then I... I did it!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What exactly do you mean when you say you, "did it"?
Meekins:
I know I don't look the type, but I'm really into kung fu films, sir! The man let his guard down for just an instant, so I snatched his knife from him!
Phoenix:
You took his knife?
Meekins:
I spun him around and performed a disarming maneuver! I made sure to close my eyes like a man!
Phoenix:
I, uh, see... (He must have been desperate.)
Meekins:
The next thing I knew, his white coat was drenched in a sea of my blood, and then... Then, the next thing I knew...
Judge:
Yes?
Meekins:
He punched me right in my face, sir!
Meekins:
After that I passed out... until another officer smacked me awake!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
About what time did you regain consciousness?
Meekins:
No offense, sir, but how am I supposed to know that? I was unconscious!
Phoenix:
Oh... right.
Edgeworth:
According to the report from the officer that woke up the witness, it was about 5:30.
Meekins:
He hit me right in the head too! I woke up crying tears of pain!
Judge:
That's nice... Er, I mean... it's nice that you recovered, that is...
Meekins:
When I came around though, I made sure to finish my mission, sir!
Phoenix:
Your "mission"...?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! The Blue Badger, sir! I returned him to the entrance before things got out of hand!
Phoenix:
(Well, we can all rest easy now...)
Ema:
This is what he was telling us yesterday.
Phoenix:
Well, we need to try and skim some more detail from him. For starters, what was an officer from the General Affairs Department doing in there in the first place?
Ema:
Right! Let's press him for all he's worth!
(Pressing all statements leads to:)
Judge:
I believe we now have a fairly accurate picture of what happened.
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor. Only one thing remains unclear. Was the man this officer "murdered," really the victim?
Phoenix:
(He's got a point...)
Meekins:
Um...
Judge:
Yes, Officer Meekins?
Meekins:
With regard to that, sir... Take a look at this. It was sent to my cell. Chief Gant delivered it to me just this morning sir!
Edgeworth:
The Chief?
Phoenix:
Delivered it...?
Judge:
What is that? A... videotape?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! That's absolutely right, sir! A videotape, sir! It contains footage from the security camera in the evidence room.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
What!? But I specifically asked if there was such a tape, and was told it had been mistakenly erased!
Judge:
That's quite a mistake.
Meekins:
I just do what I'm told, sir. It's the only thing I'm really good at.
Phoenix:
(Looks like communication with the Police Department is as good as ever...)
Judge:
Well then, let's have a look! Show us the video of you murdering the victim!
Meekins:
Oh... Please stop using that word, "murder," sir! It scares me!
Phoenix:
(A video of a real murder... Just what are we getting ourselves into...?) ...
Edgeworth:
...
Meekins:
...
Judge:
Well, I believe we're all thinking the same thing. How can we deal with these unsettling feelings stirred within us...?
Edgeworth:
What the hell was that wriggling piece of plywood!?
Meekins:
Sir! That is the pride and joy of the entire Criminal Affairs Department, sir! It's the Blue Badger, sir!
Phoenix:
(Why am I not surprised this isn't going smoothly?)
Security Video added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Yes, well anyway... this tape seems to prove that that the witness did indeed encounter... er, "someone" in the evidence room, and some sort of... er, "activity" did take place...
Edgeworth:
Your Honor... instead of relying on clearly incomplete footage, the witness's testimony will suffice. Is that alright with you, Officer Meekins?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! As you wish, sir!
Witness Testimony
-- Mystery Man --
Meekins:
His face can't be clearly seen in the video,
but there's no question that the other person was Detective Goodman, sir!
I mean, he opened the locker, which required Detective Goodman's fingerprint to do!
The locker he opened is unquestionably Detective Goodman's locker, sir!
So it must be him! No one else could have unlocked it!
Judge:
What's this about a fingerprint?
Edgeworth:
Each detective has been given a locker, equipped with a fingerprint-activated lock. These locks ensure that each locker can only be opened by the detective it belongs to.
Judge:
Intriguing... That would mean... the victim at the crime scene would have to have been Detective Goodman. Very well! The defense may begin its cross-examination!
Phoenix:
(I don't know where this cross-examination will lead, but everything begins with contradictions. That's where I have to start!)
Cross Examination
-- Mystery Man --
Meekins:
His face can't be clearly seen in the video,
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Tell me, were you able to get a good look at him? At the face of the man who attacked you with a knife?
Meekins:
S-sir! If you must label people as having "seen" or "not seen" the man's face... I believe I would be classified as... the latter?
Phoenix:
The latter? But you were standing right in front of him, were you not?
Judge:
More to the point, you are the person who fought him, aren't you?
Meekins:
Oh, yes sir! But... I didn't get a clear look at his face, sir. I'm not the kind of guy who looks directly at people when talking with them, you see...
Phoenix:
(Yeah, that's a good trait for a police officer...)
Meekins:
Still, I'm sure it was him! I'd bet my badge on it!
Meekins:
but there's no question that the other person was Detective Goodman, sir!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
But you don't know that for sure, do you? You never actually saw Detective Goodman's face.
Meekins:
Well... I suppose you might say that. That is, if you must label people as having "seen" or "not seen" it.
Judge:
Since his face can't be identified in the video, only you can verify it.
Meekins:! W-w-why is everyone l-looking at me? If I had to label your stares as "disturbing" or...
Edgeworth:
Meekins!
Meekins:
Eek!
Edgeworth:
Having been shown a questionable video at best, we are not in the best of moods. Now please be more certain when you testify!
Meekins:
Y-y-yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
You claimed the man who brandished a knife on you was Bruce Goodman. Tell us why you are positive it was him!
Present Security Video
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Regarding the video contained on this tape, there is one thing in particular that seems rather strange.
Judge:
Strange?
Phoenix:
This contradiction leads to the possibility that... the man may not be Detective Goodman.
Judge:
What? This video contains such a contradiction?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Interesting... Your Honor, I have a proposal.
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I propose we have the defense... point out to us this alleged "contradiction" in the video.
Phoenix:
(He would want me to point it out...)
Judge:
Very well, proposal accepted. Let us further inspect this piece of evidence. I will now play the security tape. Mr. Wright. Please show us this contradiction you speak of.
Phoenix:
(I have to point out a problem in the video? This is the first time I've ever had to do that.)
Ema:
You can do it, Mr. Wright! It's set up so you can Fast Forward, Rewind or Pause the video. Just take a good look and be sure to point out the right thing!
Meekins:
Please don't play it too many times. I-I can't stand watching this video!
Phoenix:
(How did this guy ever become a police officer?)
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Please enlighten us! Where is the contradiction that indicates the man may not be Detective Goodman?
Present Unlock light above Goodman's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this!"
Present Item falling out of Goodman's locker or White cloth from Marshall's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this!
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, that is strange. Something certainly seems unnatural about that. What could it mean?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Wright... but you seem to have forgotten the point of this exercise.
Phoenix:
The point...?
Edgeworth:
What you are looking for is one thing and one thing only: Something that indicates the man may not be Detective Goodman.
Phoenix:
Oh, yeah.
Judge:
Whew... I almost walked right into the defense's trap!
Meekins:
I'll place him under arrest, sir!
Phoenix:
(Rats... I need to slow down and tackle these things one piece at a time. Now what do I do?)
Play video again
Phoenix:
Very well. Let's try this again.
Edgeworth:
Just remember one thing, Mr. Wright: Every time you point your finger, someone gets hurt.
Ema:
But he's the one pointing his finger...
Leads back to:
"I will now play the security tape. Mr. Wright."
Cross examine again
Phoenix:
(It seems I've been taking the wrong approach.)
Judge:
Now then, the defense may resume its cross-examination. Assuming the witness is still willing to continue, that is. Officer Meekins?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! It is my duty as a police officer to help those lost, sir!
Phoenix:
(Great. Now they think I'm lost...)
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... would have to be... uh, this?
Judge:
... Hold on a second. I need to use my eye drops. ... Well, I don't get it.
Phoenix:
... Um, would you mind if I borrowed your eye medicine?
Judge:
Don't look at me with those bleary eyes!
Edgeworth:
Before your eyes get too teary, perhaps you should think this through again, hmm?
Phoenix:
(Now what do I do?)
Play video again
Phoenix:
Very well. Let's try this again.

Meekins:
I mean, he opened the locker, which required Detective Goodman's fingerprint to do!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
About these lockers... Is there no other way to open them?
Meekins:
No, sir! I myself tried all kinds of methods in the past! They only respond to registered fingerprints, sir!
Phoenix:
(I wonder what kind of methods he's tried...?)
Judge:
If the man opened the locker's lock, which only responds to its registered fingerprints, then he must be the person the locker was assigned to.
Meekins:
Exactly my point, sir! And this too!

How do you know that information?

I've heard rumors, sir! From people in the know, sir!
Phoenix:
"People in the know"?
Meekins:
The workers in the department cafeteria, sir! They keep me informed! They also listen to my... romantic troubles, sir!
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
For the record... the opened locker did indeed belong to Detective Goodman. I verified this information through a more... reliable source.
Judge:
Hmm... So the victim opened the locker with his own fingerprint.

S-sir! If I may say something, sir!
Judge:
Please do. After all, you are the one being examined.
Meekins:
I don't understand why the man's face is so important in this case, sir! I mean, it was his hand that opened the fingerprint lock... and it was his hand that tried to thrust his knife into my body, sir! My unsettled state can testify enough to this, sir! Yes, you have a point. The footage doesn't lie.
Edgeworth:
That is... unless the defense can find a problem with it?
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Let's check the Court Record again!
Phoenix:
(Is there a problem with the security video?)
No problem
Phoenix:
The tape was provided by the Police Department, so there's no problem with it.
Edgeworth:
I admire your trust in the Police Department Mr. Wright.
Ema:
But if you ask me, I think there's a problem with what's shown on the tape... rather than with the actual tape itself.
There's a problem
Leads to:
"Regarding the video contained on this tape, there is one thing in particular that seems rather strange."
Phoenix:
Regarding the video contained on this tape, there is one thing in particular that seems rather strange.
Judge:
Strange?
Phoenix:
This contradiction leads to the possibility that... the man may not be Detective Goodman.
Judge:
What? This video contains such a contradiction?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Interesting... Your Honor, I have a proposal.
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I propose we have the defense... point out to us this alleged "contradiction" in the video.
Phoenix:
(He would want me to point it out...)
Judge:
Very well, proposal accepted. Let us further inspect this piece of evidence. I will now play the security tape. Mr. Wright. Please show us this contradiction you speak of.
Phoenix:
(I have to point out a problem in the video? This is the first time I've ever had to do that.)
Ema:
You can do it, Mr. Wright! It's set up so you can Fast Forward, Rewind or Pause the video. Just take a good look and be sure to point out the right thing!
Meekins:
Please don't play it too many times. I-I can't stand watching this video!
Phoenix:
(How did this guy ever become a police officer?)
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Please enlighten us! Where is the contradiction that indicates the man may not be Detective Goodman?
Present Unlock light above Goodman's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this!"
Present Item falling out of Goodman's locker or White cloth from Marshall's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this!
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, that is strange. Something certainly seems unnatural about that. What could it mean?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Wright... but you seem to have forgotten the point of this exercise.
Phoenix:
The point...?
Edgeworth:
What you are looking for is one thing and one thing only: Something that indicates the man may not be Detective Goodman.
Phoenix:
Oh, yeah.
Judge:
Whew... I almost walked right into the defense's trap!
Meekins:
I'll place him under arrest, sir!
Phoenix:
(Rats... I need to slow down and tackle these things one piece at a time. Now what do I do?)
Play video again
Phoenix:
Very well. Let's try this again.
Edgeworth:
Just remember one thing, Mr. Wright: Every time you point your finger, someone gets hurt.
Ema:
But he's the one pointing his finger...
Leads back to:
"I will now play the security tape. Mr. Wright."
Cross examine again
Phoenix:
(It seems I've been taking the wrong approach.)
Judge:
Now then, the defense may resume its cross-examination. Assuming the witness is still willing to continue, that is. Officer Meekins?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! It is my duty as a police officer to help those lost, sir!
Phoenix:
(Great. Now they think I'm lost...)
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... would have to be... uh, this?
Judge:
... Hold on a second. I need to use my eye drops. ... Well, I don't get it.
Phoenix:
... Um, would you mind if I borrowed your eye medicine?
Judge:
Don't look at me with those bleary eyes!
Edgeworth:
Before your eyes get too teary, perhaps you should think this through again, hmm?
Phoenix:
(Now what do I do?)
Play video again
Phoenix:
Very well. Let's try this again.

(Great. Now they think I'm lost...)
Phoenix:
(This all sounds true enough, but the victim's body was found at the Prosecutor's Office. There has to be a mistake somewhere...)
Ema:
The real thing's so much more intense than in the movies! Here, you can use the player to watch it as much as you'd like.
Phoenix:
The security video... (Maybe I should take another look at the footage...)
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this! Officer Meekins.
Meekins:
Sir! D-do you mean me, sir?
Phoenix:
As I understand it, the locker apparatus works like this: When you grab the handle, a sensor reads your fingerprint. If the print matches the registered data, the light turns on and the lock is released.
Meekins:
A-according to my very limited experience, that's the way I understand it, sir!
Phoenix:
If so, then something is seriously wrong with this picture! When the victim reaches for the handle to open the locker... Let's rewind to a little earlier... Here! Notice the light?
Judge:
What's this!? It's... already lit!
Phoenix:
Precisely my point, Your Honor. The locker was already open before the victim grabbed the handle!
Meekins:
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
Judge:
Order! Order! What's the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
It's very simple, Your Honor. The locker wasn't locked on the day of the crime!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But the locker locks are controlled by an electronic system. When a door is shut, a sensor is triggered... and the locker is automatically locked!
Judge:
Oh, I know! It must have broken down! Of course, I'm not an expert in this...
Edgeworth:
That's not likely, Your Honor. The sensor would detect and report any malfunction.
Judge:
Oh well. It just goes to show novices should keep their mouths shut. So then, Mr. Wright. Do you have an explanation?
Phoenix:
Me, Your Honor?
Judge:
Yes. Why wasn't the locker locked?
Phoenix:
Me, Your Honor? ... Yes, well. You see... This isn't exactly my field... What do you think, Miss "Scientific Investigator"?
Ema:
Huh? Oh, um... Maybe something, like, jammed the electronic system?
Phoenix:
(Something... jammed the sensor? Say... There's something else that seems out of place in this video.)
Ema:
Yeah, I thought so too! There's got to be another clue somewhere in this footage!
Judge:
Very well. Let's inspect the video once more. The locker wasn't locked... Mr. Wright. Please point out the cause for this!
Present Item falling out of Goodman's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Please watch closely. This is the continuation of the part I showed you earlier."
Present White cloth from Marshall's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this!
Judge:
Oh yes, that! I found that quite disturbing myself! Such sloppiness should not be accepted in any law enforcement agency!
Phoenix:
Uh, no Your Honour. That's not exactly what I meant...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
It seems yet again you've lost sight of the problem at hand.
Phoenix:
What?
Edgeworth:
The reason the locker was not locked. That is the one and only thing you must point out here, Mr. Wright.
Judge:
Whew... It seems I almost walked right into the defense's trap again!
Meekins:
Now I'll REALLY place him under arrest, sir!
Phoenix:
(I've got to stay focused on that locking mechanism.)
Leads back to:
"Very well. Let's inspect the video once more."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... would have to be... uh, this?
Judge:
... Hold on a second. I need to use my eye drops. ... Well, I don't get it.
Phoenix:
... Um, would you mind if I borrowed your eye medicine?

Don't look at me with those bleary eyes!
Edgeworth:
Before your eyes get too teary, perhaps you should think this through again, hmm?
Leads back to:
"Very well. Let's inspect the video once more."
Phoenix:
Please watch closely. This is the continuation of the part I showed you earlier.
Judge:
What's this? Something white fell out of the locker!
Meekins:But sir! It's been my experience that things fall out when doors are opened! I often fall out and roll great distances when I open my car door, sir!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
We can't be sure that item was in the locker to begin with.
Judge:
What do you mean?
Phoenix:
The sensor triggers the lock when the door is shut... What if something was inserted, say, between the sensor and the door?
Judge:
In... Inserted...?
Phoenix:
This white thing wasn't inside the locker... It was stuck between the door and the sensor!
Meekins:
Oh, I understand now, sir! It's just like my tie! Two out of three times it gets stuck in the door when I get out of my patrol vehicle, sir! Instead of the door closing, My tie chokes me!
Judge:
But the object would have to be extremely thin to fit in the door.
Edgeworth:
Not only that, it would also have to block electrical currents... It would need to be an insulator.
Judge:
Yes, an insulator! But at the crime scene...
Phoenix:
there just might have been something that fits the description.
Meekins:
But s-sir! By "insulator," you don't mean...
Phoenix:
(I think I've finally got this figured out.)
Judge:
Very well! Will the defense please present the relevant evidence! What was this insulator that was stuck in the door?
Present Rubber Glove
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I found this near the locker: a thin rubber glove."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Behold! This was stuck in the locker door!
Edgeworth:
How about sticking your finger in instead?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
You are rather thin. It just might fit...
Phoenix:
(I think my own current's just been blocked.)
Ema:
Instead of being sarcastic, why don't you think this through again?
Phoenix:
(Something thin enough to slip in the door, yet not conductive to electricity...)
Leads back to:
"Very well! Will the defense please present the relevant evidence!"
Phoenix:
I found this near the locker: a thin rubber glove.
Judge:
But we can't be sure that was in the victim's locker.
Phoenix:
It has a tag that says, "SL-9 Incident."
Edgeworth:!
Phoenix:
The video seems to depict the victim opening the locker, but that isn't the case! The lit lamp attests to this. On the day of the crime, even I could have opened that locker! Is this not so, Officer Meekins!?
Meekins:
Sir... It would appear so, sir!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! So are we to believe then, that the "victim" whom this witness stabbed in the evidence room... was not Detective Goodman?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Do not be misled, Your Honor.
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
The defense has merely demonstrated that possibility, and nothing more. The "victim" in the video was indeed Bruce Goodman. The prosecution will offer one more testimony to prove this!
Phoenix:
What!?
Edgeworth:
Officer Meekins, please testify about this.
Meekins:
Sir! M-me, sir!? I'm not sure what you're referring too, sir...
Edgeworth:
...
Meekins:
O-oh! You mean that, sir! Of course, sir!
Phoenix:
(Is this a joke...?)
Judge:
Very well, begin your testimony!
Witness Testimony
-- Mystery Man (2) --
Meekins:
There's one other thing that proves the man was Detective Goodman, sir!
To enter the evidence room, one must use their ID card!
When an ID card is used, there's a record of it!
At the time of the crime, the detective had used his card!
Judge:
An ID card record. I see...
Edgeworth:
I have the ID card record right here, Your Honor. The ID used at 5:14... is that of the victim.
Judge:
Just before the crime, hmm? Yes, without a doubt this is the victim's ID! However, one thing does strike me as unusual... Several hundred cases should have been due for transferal. Why were there so few people using this room?
Edgeworth:
This particular evidence room is only used for storing certain special cases.
Phoenix:
"Special" cases...?
Edgeworth:
Extremely violent cases involving police staff.
Ema:
Just hearing that makes my hair stand on end!
Phoenix:
(Me too, although it doesn't make much of a difference...)
Edgeworth:
There were only a few cases up for transferal there, and most were cleared up by noon.
Judge:
Right... I see. Now, Let us move on to the cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Mystery Man (2) --
Meekins:
There's one other thing that proves the man was Detective Goodman, sir!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, unlike your earlier testimony, you believe this to be rock solid, do you?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! Solid as stone, sir! If my hand wasn't wrapped in bandages... I'd even give the 'V for Victory' sign, sir!
Ema:
Couldn't he just use his right hand for that...?
Judge:
Let's hear him out. The witness can't afford to make any more mistakes.
Meekins:
To enter the evidence room, one must use their ID card!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Is that card hanging from your neck one of these ID cards?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! This card right next to my cuffs, sir! I keep it here so I won't ever forget it!
Phoenix:
But what if someone were to steal it from you, keeping it out in the open like that?
Meekins:
... Maybe I shouldn't wear it around my neck... Remember when I said two out of three times my tie gets stuck in my car door when I get out? Well, the remaining time my ID card gets stuck. Instead of the door closing, my ID card chokes me!
Phoenix:
(Maybe I should just leave this one alone...)
Edgeworth:
At any rate, each police officer has only one ID card. Both the Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office can attest to this.
Judge:
Please proceed with your testimony.
Present Goodman's ID or Goodman's Lost Item Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait one moment, Officer Meekins."
Meekins:
When an ID card is used, there's a record of it!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Let it be noted that this is the record the witness referred to.
Judge:
Let me see... yes, that would be it. Detective Goodman...
Phoenix:
? (What's the matter?)
Judge:
A-according to this... Mr. Edgeworth! Your name is on here!
Edgeworth:
So it is, Your Honor.
Not that prosecutor again...
Hey, maybe he's behind all this! Being a prosecutor, he could hide the evidence!
Mommy! Is that man in blue a murderer?
Ssh! Don't stare at him!
Phoenix:
(You've got the wrong color, kid.)
Judge:
It would seem... the inquiry committee will want to speak with you again today.
Edgeworth:
I have nothing to be ashamed of regarding my actions, or their consequences. For now, let us continue with the cross-examination.
Ema:
Poor Mr. Edgeworth... It must be so difficult for him...
Present Goodman's ID or Goodman's Lost Item Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait one moment, Officer Meekins."
Meekins:
At the time of the crime, the detective had used his card!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Earlier I believe you testified that when you asked the man to show his ID card, he pulled a knife on you.
Meekins:
Yes, sir! He didn't show me any ID card, sir!
Phoenix:
Don't you think that's odd? I mean, if he had his ID card, all he had to do was show it to you. There wouldn't be any reason to draw a knife!
Meekins:
... M-maybe he just panicked?
Phoenix:
(Everything stems from contradictions. Let's point them out...)
Present Goodman's ID or Goodman's Lost Item Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait one moment, Officer Meekins."
Ema:
Mr. Wright! What do you think?
Phoenix:
I'm... confused.
Ema:
What?
Phoenix:
(The problem with this ID card testimony is far too obvious. It's not like Edgeworth to miss something like this...)
Ema:
You're thinking too hard about it. Come on, let's show them what we've got!
Phoenix:
Wait one moment, Officer Meekins.
Meekins:
I-I'm not good at waiting, sir!
Phoenix:
I have the victim's ID card right here. I found it at the crime scene.
Judge:
That makes sense.
Phoenix:
When I say, "crime scene," I'm not referring to the evidence room at the Police Department. I mean the "other" crime scene... The underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office!
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
Your Honor... I have one more piece of evidence to present. It's a very important clue regarding the victim's ID card.
Judge:
A... Lost Item Report? It's only half completed,
Phoenix:
but it shows that Detective Goodman had lost "something" on the day of the crime. Something important enough to fill out this report.
Edgeworth:
Let me guess. You believe this "something" to be his ID card, right?
Phoenix:
I can't say for sure... but there is a high probability! On the day of the crime, Detective Goodman was not carrying his card!
Judge:
Order! Order! So now... what does this all mean?
Phoenix:
It can only mean one thing. It doesn't require much thought! The man Officer Meekins encountered in the evidence room... was not Detective Goodman, but rather the man who stole his ID card!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Does the prosecution have a response?
Edgeworth:
... I have only one thing to say to the defense.
Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
Bravo, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
B-bravo...?
Edgeworth:
Allow me to summarize the defense's argument. At 5:15 PM on the day of the crime, the man Officer Meekins encountered in the evidence room was not Detective Goodman. There are two grounds to support this. First, the locker in the evidence room was already unlocked. Second, the victim lost his ID card. Am I correct so far, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes... (What's he up to?)
Edgeworth:
That being the case, we must inevitably arrive at a single conclusion: If the "victim" in this video is a fake... then the murder in the evidence room is also fake! In other words, the security camera does not show the instant of the murder.
Phoenix:
Uh... Th-that is... Well, I guess that's right...
Edgeworth:
Is something wrong, Mr. Wright? Only moments ago you seemed content to be pointing your finger around.
Phoenix:
This isn't good...
Edgeworth:
Well, well... It seems you've finally realized... exactly what you've gone to such lengths to prove!
Judge:
Explain yourself, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
The defense has already done the explaining for me. The victim in this video is a fake... which means a murder did not take place at the Police Department at 5:15 on the day of the crime.
Judge:
So...
Edgeworth:
So the real crime could only take place at one location: the underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office! The murderer being Ms. Lana Skye, the defendant! The evidence is compelling! A trustworthy witness... observed the moment the defendant used the murder weapon!
Phoenix:
Aaaah! (I knew that testimony was way too shabby. It was all a trap from the beginning!)
Judge:
The activity in the evidence room still leaves many questions unanswered: Who exactly was the "victim" Officer Meekins encountered? And where did this person disappear to...? However... This trial's purpose is to examine only the murder of Detective Goodman.
Edgeworth:
Just so, Your Honor.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! You have to do something, or else Lana...
Phoenix:
(What do I do? How am I supposed to get myself out of this mess?)
Object
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"One moment, Your Honor!"
Wait and see what happens
Phoenix:
(I'd better pace myself. If I rush ahead, I might run right into another trap!)
Ema:
But Mr. Wright! If you don't do anything...
Judge:
It seems the defense is out of ammunition.
Edgeworth:
The surrender flag has been raised. Your Honor, may we have your ruling now?
Ema:
Don't give up, Mr. Wright! Get up and fight!
Phoenix:!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"One moment, Your Honor!"
Phoenix:
One moment, Your Honor!
Edgeworth:
What now, Mr. Wright? Don't tell me you're objecting to what you've just proven.
Phoenix:
Of course not. But I almost walked right into the prosecution's trap!
Edgeworth:
What are you talking about?
Phoenix:
This cross-examination has proven one thing and one thing only. The security video did not show the actual murder. However! It cannot be said that it is unrelated to the murder in the parking lot. Specifically, large amounts of blood traces were found in the evidence room!
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
The defense demands further examination into the truth of the matter!
Judge:
...Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
If this court were to examine this further, other witnesses will be necessary. Is the prosecution prepared?
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, Your Honor... The prosecution considered the incident at the Police Department to be unrelated. We have not prepared any other witnesses for this incident.
Phoenix:
(This just might be my chance. Time to call a certain Texas ranger to the stand!)
Ema:
Mr. Wright... Do you mean...
Phoenix:
Your Honor. The defense would like to request a specific witness.
Judge:
Oh? Whom do you have in mind?
Phoenix:
Someone we have reason to believe knows the truth... The truth behind the activities that took place in the evidence room.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution requests to hear this person's name before deciding whether or not to comply.
Judge:
Very well, then. Mr. Wright! This person whom you would have testify... What is his or her name?
Present Jake Marshall profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Officer... Jake Marshall."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, I'm not even going to bother asking you why. I've never seen a more obvious stall tactic in my entire career!
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Don't you remember what you said this morning!? You know, about your "trump card"?
Phoenix:
(That's right! Those bloody fingerprints we found in the evidence room... Now's my chance to bring him in to testify!)
Leads back to:
"Very well, then. Mr. Wright!"
Phoenix:
Officer... Jake Marshall.
Edgeworth:
Why him?
Phoenix:
(I can't let him know everything just yet...) He's in charge of the evidence room. I feel we should hear what he has to say.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution agrees to the defense's request. Since he was responsible for guarding the room, we should hear his testimony. Fortunately he works in the Police Department. We shouldn't need longer than 20 minutes to prepare.
Judge:
Very well. The court will take a 30 minute recess while the witness is subpoenaed. Will the prosecution please prepare the witness during this time?
Edgeworth:
We will, Your Honor.
Judge:
Court in recess!

Ema:
Lana... You're the one who knows everything!

Sorry, Detective.

You better be, pal...Hey... Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Hey!!!! I didn't see you there, Ms. Skye!
Lana:
That's ok. So... Have you brought what I asked?
Gumshoe:
Oh... Oh ho! Oh ho ho! Oh ho ho ho! Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho! You mean this, right!?
Lana:
My apologies, Detective. Due to my present circumstances, I was forced to use Mr. Wright's name when making my request.
Phoenix:
My name!?
Gumshoe:
Never in a million years would I have thought it was you who asked me, "Could I bother you to bring me the SL-9 Incident files?" "I'll need them by noon." Talk about crazy...
Phoenix:
The "SL-9 Incident"?
Ema:
But Lana! That's...
Lana:
I thought Mr. Wright might need them, so I had them brought here. Here. You might do well to read them.
Gumshoe:
I can't believe you, the Chief Prosecutor, were a witness in that case!
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye... was a witness?
Received file of SL-9 Incident Files.
Gumshoe:
Take it from me, you don't want anything to do with serial murders.
Phoenix:
...
Gumshoe:
Oh, what? Now that I've brought you your stuff, you're just gonna ignore me?
Phoenix:
E-Ema! But why... Why is your name in here?
Ema:
What? My name's in there!? I don't know... Unless... No, it couldn't be... Lana! This "SL-9 Incident"... Is that...
Lana:
... That's the classification number the police filed it under. Two years ago, the rest of the world knew it as... the "Joe Darke Killings."
Ema:
The... Joe Darke... No... No, Lana! That's over with! No!!!
Phoenix:
Ema, wait! (She ran away...)
Examine evidence
Back of Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
A number is engraved on the back of the badge. I wish they'd put my name on it instead...
Identification on Goodman's ID
Phoenix:
His name and ID number is written on it. "Detective Bruce Goodman, ID# 5842189"
Bottom of Prosecutor Trophy
Phoenix:
"King of Prosecutors." The names of past recipients are etched on the plate. Manfred von Karma's name appears too... How ironic.
Blood on Edgeworth's Knife
Phoenix:
The victim Bruce Goodman's blood still remains on the blade. I wonder if Edgeworth got this knife because the handle matches his clothes...?
Front of Parking Stub
Phoenix:
"Miles Edgeworth - 17:12"... It's dated the day of the murder.
Strap on Cell Phone
Phoenix:
Come to think of it, I don't have a strap on my mobile phone at all. I hate having useless things dangling off it.
Redial button on Cell Phone
Phoenix:
The redial button. It dials the number of the last person called. The last call was to Ema. I wonder what they spoke about...?
Blood on Victim's Shoe
Phoenix:
Blood is splattered over the white enamel surface. It must be Lana's blood, form the cut on her right hand she now has bandaged.
Blood under Victim's Shoe
Phoenix:
These blood traces are from Bruce Goodman, the victim. He must have tried to run after he was stabbed.
Tag on Switchblade Knife
Phoenix:
"SL-9" is written on a small tag attached to the knife. It was the weapon used in that incident two years ago; and has known many victims.
Bottom of Luminol Testing Fluid
Phoenix:
Ema Skye is written on the side in permanent marker. She seems awfully possessive about a can of luminol.
Tag on Screwdriver
Phoenix:
"AI-16" is written on the tag. That means it has nothing to do with the current case.
Tag on Rubber Glove
Phoenix:
"SL-9 11" is written on the tag. It seems this is more evidence from that incident.
Bloodstain on Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
There's a trace of old blood on this jar. This was evidence in the SL-9 Incident... The blood must be from back then.
Bottom of Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
The jar has no bottom, so the hole goes right through. I wonder if it's really jar, or some kind of weird telescope...?
Gumshoe:
Uh, ya know what? I just remembered... I gotta be somewhere. Sorry pal, but I'm outta here!
Phoenix:
(Jake Marshall, Angel Starr, Damon Gant, Miles Edgeworth... Not to mention Lana and Ema...) Everyone involved in this case is connected to those killings two years ago... This can't be just a "coincidence."
Lana:
Knowing you, you just might be able to figure it out. Time to get back to the trial, Mr. Wright. Best of luck.
Phoenix:
(I'd better take a good look at this file...)
To be continued.
February 24, 12:14 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
The court will now reconvene for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
Phoenix:
(Ema didn't come back...)
Edgeworth:
Allow me to call the next witness to the stand: the officer in charge of guarding the evidence room on the day of the crime.
Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and occupation.
Marshall:
Me, pardner? Oh, I'm just a man, same as you, wanderin' the trails of civilization,
Edgeworth:
occasionally helping the elderly cross intersections when needed.
Judge:
Oh, I know! You're a "patrolman"!
Marshall:
As for my name, if you listen hard 'nuff, you can hear the howling wind calling it out.
Edgeworth:
To be exact, it's Jake Marshall... Your Honor.
Phoenix:
("Howling wind"...? I've never heard Edgeworth described that way before...)
Edgeworth:
Now, Mr. Marshall. Let me ask you something. You were in charge of guarding the evidence room on the day the crime took place. Is this correct?
Marshall:
According to the papers, pardner.
Judge:
What do you mean?
Marshall:
A desperado's soul is as boundless as the desert sands. No "paper" can sum it up.
Judge:
Maybe it's best we get on with this quickly. Please share with us your testimony of the day of the crime... in English!
Witness Testimony
-- Day of the Crime --
Marshall:
My job was to keep a wary eye on that bone orchard.
They said I was supposed to make rounds three times a day, but that ain't my style.
Besides, the room's protected by two security systems, anyway.
If I remember right, I was at a street-side saloon at the time it went down.
I'm just an innocent travelin' man, so if you're out of ammo it's time I hit the trail.
Judge:
I can't say I particularly care for your attitude...
Marshall:
I can't say I care for your beard, but you don't see me complainin'.
Phoenix:
Wait a minute... What do you mean by "two security systems"?
Marshall:
I mean the security cameras and the ID card reader. I reckon even a cowpoke like you knows about those.
Phoenix:
Yes, well, what about the fingerprint activated locks inside the evidence room?
Marshall:
Fingerprint activated locks? What kind of new-fangled doohickeys are those?
Phoenix:
(He's not being very helpful...)
Edgeworth:
He's not that good with machines... or with following orders.
Marshall:
Everyone's got their weaknesses, now don't they, Mr. Prosecutor?
Judge:
This one seems like trouble. Okay Mr. Wright, he's all yours.
Cross Examination
-- Day of the Crime --
Marshall:
My job was to keep a wary eye on that bone orchard.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How exactly did you "keep an eye" on the evidence room?
Marshall:
I just made sure nothing moved in the security camera monitor. That room's so still, even time dies in there. I was just a caretaker who interred the recordings.
Phoenix:
You "interred" them?
Marshall:
Videos of nothing aren't that useful. When the time would come, I'd erase the tape.
Edgeworth:
If nothing unusual is recorded, tapes are to be erased every six hours.
Marshall:
Each time I'd erase a tape, it felt like I was erasing a part of my life.
Phoenix:
(This guy has a flare for the dramatic, but it isn't going to do him any good.) So, in actuality you don't physically enter the evidence room?
Marshall:
They said I was supposed to make rounds three times a day, but that ain't my style.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
But you made your rounds on the day of the crime, right?
Marshall:
Ain't you heard a word I said, pardner? I told you that ain't my style.
Phoenix:
... Um, I'm afraid I don't understand.
Marshall:
No desperado I know lets "rules" get in his way.
Phoenix:
(No desperados I know join the police force...)
Judge:
So, Officer Marshall. On the day of the crime...?
Marshall:
Just between you and me, I didn't set foot in the evidence room that day.
Judge:
There was a rubber glove stuck in the victim's locker. Do you know anything about that?
Marshall:
Sorry pardner, can't say I do. I haven't been in that crypt in weeks.
Phoenix:
(How does this guy avoid being fired...?)
Marshall:
Besides, the room's protected by two security systems, anyway.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You used to be a detective, so you've used the evidence room in the past, correct?
Marshall:
Of course. Back in the day my locker was a goldmine of evidence!
Phoenix:
And yet... you didn't know about the fingerprint locking mechanism?
Marshall:
Sorry, pardner. I ain't good with machines. I couldn't even tell you how a bike works.
Phoenix:
That's quite, uh... incredible.
Edgeworth:
The sensors on the locker handles cannot be seen. It's well known that some detectives are unaware of their presence.
Phoenix:
(Now that he mentions it, Detective Gumshoe said something like that too...)
Judge:
At any rate, it doesn't seem that this is relevant to the crime. Can you tell us what you were doing when the crime took place?
Marshall:
If I remember right, I was at a street-side saloon at the time it went down.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What were you doing in a place like that?
Marshall:
I was eating spaghetti. Not even Angel's steak lunches can beat that parlor's vongole sepia pasta.
Judge:
Do you mean to tell us... you abandoned your police duties to eat some noodles?
Marshall:
Not all desperados eat tacos, pardner.
Judge:
That's not what I meant... I hope this has at least taught you a lesson!
Phoenix:
(That's strange... This is usually where Edgeworth says, "Did you not want a raise this year?"...)
Present Marshall's Prints
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Officer Marshall. Doesn't it strike you as odd?"
Marshall:
I'm just an innocent travelin' man, so if you're out of ammo it's time I hit the trail.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Out of "ammo," officer Marshall?
Marshall:
That's right, pardner. Or as you'd call it, "evidence." If you plan to pin me to this crime, then you'd better draw. Otherwise, you're just wastin' my time. My steel horse is waitin' to carry me back west into the sunset.
Judge:
Hmm... One thing seems clear. Despite being responsible for guarding the evidence room, the witness doesn't appear to have seen anything.
Marshall:
Texans don't take orders from anyone. Everyone knows that.
Phoenix:
(Apparently your superiors don't...)
Present Marshall's Prints
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Officer Marshall. Doesn't it strike you as odd?"
Phoenix:
(Okay... I have a trump card up my sleeve, so I'd best keep my cool. Before I use it though, I'd better up the ante...)
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall. Doesn't it strike you as odd? That is, you being called in to testify like this?
Marshall:
...
Phoenix:
After all, you weren't in the security room at the time of the crime.
Marshall:
And yet you dragged me down here. Explain yourself, pardner.
Phoenix:
It's quite simple. You left a very large trail behind at the scene. Or, to be exact... a handprint.
Marshall:
Hmph! Listen real good, pardner. Like I said, I'm the caretaker of that crypt. I pay my respects... that is, make my rounds, about once a month. It's only natural my fingerprints would be in there.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I only wish it were, Officer, but you see... your fingerprints were covered in blood!
Judge:
Witness! What's the meaning of this!? Your bloodstained fingerprints were at the crime scene...!?
Phoenix:
The blood was wiped away. However! A luminol test clearly revealed this! Well, Officer Marshall?
Marshall:
... It seems to me... there ain't a person in this room with a head on his shoulders.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
I take it you have an explanation then, Officer Marshall? About the "bloodstained" fingerprints?
Judge:
Very well, you may begin your testimony about your fingerprints, found at the scene of the crime!
Witness Testimony
-- Bloodstained Fingerprints --
Marshall:
Like I said, it's only natural for my fingerprints to be in that evidence room.
One of them just happened to be at the same place as the bloodstained handprint.
The murderer touched the locker where my fingerprint was by chance.
The bloodstain and the fingerprint are completely unrelated.
Or didn't you know the murderer was wearing gloves?
See? I had nothing to do with it.
Judge:
Hmm... The witness's explanation appears valid, although there's room for doubt.
Marshall:
Life wouldn't be any fun without any doubt, pardner.
Judge:
The defense may now cross- examine the witness.
Phoenix:
(This guy's hiding something, I can feel it! Now's my chance to prove it.)
Cross Examination
-- Bloodstained Fingerprints --
Marshall:
Like I said, it's only natural for my fingerprints to be in that evidence room.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
That's because you... how did you put it... "pay your respects," once a month?
Marshall:
Yeah, that's right. That, and one more thing... That locker happens to be mine.
Judge:
What!? What do you mean?
Marshall:
I mean what I said. That's the locker I used when I was a detective... the locker I still use. All that's in there now though is a heap of broken dreams.
Phoenix:
I see...
Marshall:
It'd be strange if my prints WEREN'T all over that locker.
Phoenix:
(Apparently his fingerprint data was never changed. He must have been using the fingerprint lock without even knowing it.)
Marshall's Fingerprints updated in the Court Record.
After pressing fifth statement
Marshall:
Are you starting to get the picture, pardner?
Phoenix:
The picture...?
Marshall:
This seal of blood... in the desert, it's just food for the buzzards.
Phoenix:!
Marshall:
There's only one reality, and that's this.
Phoenix:
(The security tape...)
Marshall:
So long as my trail isn't in there... you can't say otherwise.
Judge:
This isn't getting us anywhere, Mr. Wright. Please consider carefully where you're going with this cross-examination.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Now then, continue your testimony, Officer Marshall.
Add statement:
"Too bad it wasn't me in that video, right, pardner?"
Marshall:
One of them just happened to be at the same place as the bloodstained handprint.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So then... What about the bloody handprint?
Marshall:
Wasn't mine. It's no mystery.
Judge:
Please explain.
Marshall:
My locker is covered with my fingerprints. It just so happened...
Marshall:
The murderer touched the locker where my fingerprint was by chance.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The chances of that happening are a million to one!
Marshall:
On the contrary, one could argue just the opposite. The chances of that not happening are a million to one! Get one thing straight, pardner. You ain't gonna get no reward for me with a mere fingerprint. You wanna know why?
Marshall:
The bloodstain and the fingerprint are completely unrelated.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Unrelated?
Marshall:
They're as different as night and day. Kinda like "cereal" an' "serial." One's got to do with breakfast while the other's a type of murder.
Judge:
He's right... although seemingly alike, they're totally different.
Phoenix:
(I don't see what homonyms have to do with this...)
Marshall:
Or didn't you know the murderer was wearing gloves?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How do you know that!?
Marshall:
I may be a loner, but I still do my job. I keep up on the reports.
Edgeworth:
There was a bloodstain at the scene, thought to be left by the murderer.
Phoenix:
That's right, it was found on Detective Gumshoe's locker.
Edgeworth:
However, no fingerprints were detected on that handprint.
Phoenix:
(Oh yeah, I think we tried that too.)
Judge:
Hmm...So that would mean... the murderer, wearing gloves, happened to place his hand on top of Officer Marshall's fingerprint.
Marshall:
That's the only logical conclusion.
After pressing first statement
Marshall:
Are you starting to get the picture, pardner?
Phoenix:
The picture...?
Marshall:
This seal of blood... in the desert, it's just food for the buzzards.
Phoenix:!
Marshall:
There's only one reality, and that's this.
Phoenix:
(The security tape...)
Marshall:
So long as my trail isn't in there... you can't say otherwise.
Judge:
This isn't getting us anywhere, Mr. Wright. Please consider carefully where you're going with this cross-examination.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Now then, continue your testimony, Officer Marshall.
Add statement:
"Too bad it wasn't me in that video, right, pardner?"
Marshall:
Too bad it wasn't me in that video, right, pardner?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean by that?
Marshall:
You want to tie me to this crime, isn't that right, pardner?
Phoenix:
...
Marshall:
If so, that video is the only direct evidence you have.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But that video is next to useless! It's full of blind spots!
Judge:
Blind spots?
Phoenix:
Places you can't see! The camera's panning back and forth, the floor isn't shown... If someone was familiar with the camera's position, he could leave the room without being caught on tape!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
We don't have time for your speculations, Mr. Wright.
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright. If you can show us evidence in this video that indicates Officer Marshall was present, please do so now.
Show evidence
Leads to:
"Very well. Allow me to point out your mistake, Officer Marshall!"
No evidence in video
Phoenix:
(I might be walking right into Officer Marshall's trap. It's better to find out a little more information.)
Edgeworth:
It seems we should be moving back to the testimony.
Judge:
Very well. Officer Marshall, can you please give your testimony again?
Leads back to:
"Like I said, it's only natural for my fingerprints to be in that evidence room."
Phoenix:
Very well. Allow me to point out your mistake, Officer Marshall!
Edgeworth:
Tread carefully, Mr. Wright, or you might wind up being the one making the mistake.
Judge:
Now then, let's have another look at the video. Show us this incriminating evidence of the witness... Officer Jake Marshall!
Present White cloth from Marshall's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Bringing our attention back to the security camera..."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
There! How's that for evidence!?
Judge:
...
Marshall:
...
Edgeworth:
Please allow me to apologize for my colleague, Your Honor. He gets carried away sometimes.
Judge:
Yes, well, this certainly isn't a first.
Edgeworth:
Will you forgive him too, Officer Marshall? He's not a bad man, just a bit... disillusioned.
Marshall:
Of course. I'm not one to gun down unarmed boys.
Phoenix:
(Oh great, now Edgeworth is defending me. Guess that means I missed the mark.)
Judge:
Very well, let's get back to the cross-examination.
Phoenix:
(I can't let him squirm out of this one. I've got to find something, something decisive, to tie Officer Marshall to this crime!)
Phoenix:
Bringing our attention back to the security camera... is a mistake I'm afraid you'll soon not forget, Officer Marshall.
Marshall:
... The days are short in Texas... and so are our tempers. Could you sum up what you have to say in eight words or less?
Phoenix:
Very well. You can clearly be seen in this video!
Marshall:
Exactly eight words... Not bad, pardner.
Phoenix:
The key... lies in a certain locker shown in the video.
Judge:
See this locker that has a white cloth sticking out? This is the witness's locker.
Phoenix:
Now then, let's rewind the video a bit.
Judge:
Oh! The white cloth... it's gone! What's the meaning of this, Officer Marshall!?
Phoenix:
When the crime took place... The white cloth wasn't there. Then... it suddenly appeared! There's only one explanation: Officer Marshall! You were in the evidence room at the time of the crime! What's more, you opened your locker when the camera was turned away!
Judge:
Order! Order! It would seem that's the only-
Marshall:
Hold your horses! Sorry, pardner... but you got the wrong man.
Phoenix:
...
Marshall:
So what if my locker was opened? That doesn't mean I'm the one who opened it!
Edgeworth:
...
Marshall:
The murderer needed to hide something, so he opened a locker and stuck it in. It's not my fault he happened to choose mine!
Judge:
...
Marshall:
... Why's everyone staring at me like I'm a wanted man?
Phoenix:
(This guy isn't just playing dumb... He really doesn't know!) Uh, I hate to rain on your parade, but you're the only person who can open that particular locker.
Marshall:
Oh yeah? I call your bluff. You say I opened that locker... Now prove it!
Present Evidence Locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"A... "fingerprint" sensor?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Marshall:
... You can talk the talk alright, but you got a long ways to go before you can walk the walk!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... I think even I could prove this one.
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor... (If that's Officer Marshall's locker... Then only he can open it. I should know this!)
Marshall:
Come on, pardner. A revolver only holds five bullets. The question is, how many you got left?
Leads back to:
"You say I opened that locker... Now prove it!"
Marshall:
A... "fingerprint" sensor?
Phoenix:
We talked about this earlier today. The lockers can only be opened by the detectives they belong to.
Marshall:
W-what kinda crazy talk is this!?
Phoenix:
(Well, Detective Gumshoe did mention something about this...)
Gumshoe:
In any case, the locks aren't that obvious. There's even some people in the force that don't know about the fingerprint locks!
Phoenix:
So, sheriff! What do you have to say... in eight words or less?
Marshall:
I only got one word for you, pardner. NOOOOOO!!!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Witness! Explain yourself!
Marshall:
If this is a joke, it's the worst I've ever heard...
Phoenix:
I assure you this is no joke, Officer Marshall. Now then, please tell us what you were doing in the evidence room at the time of the crime?
Marshall:
...
Judge:
Olé! Please answer the question!
Phoenix:
(What is he now, a bullfighter?) That's alright, Officer Marshall. I believe we can figure the rest out from here.
Judge:
We can?
Phoenix:
Have a look at these floor plans. There is no place for someone to hide in the evidence room. Yet, Officer Meekins didn't see Officer Marshall.
Judge:
If that's so, then... where was the witness?
Edgeworth:
It seems Mr. Wright has an answer.
Phoenix:
(That's right. The only possible conclusion!)
Judge:
Well then? Let's hear it. Where was Officer Marshall at the time of the crime?
Present Victim's location
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Officer Marshall was standing right here!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall was standing right here!
Judge:
Hmm... So Officer Meekins didn't notice him standing there... That's almost as credible as Meekins's warp theory.
Marshall:
Your chamber's empty, pardner. Better reload.
Phoenix:
(Now they're ganging up on me!)
Judge:
Perhaps... You should think a little more about where Officer Marshall was.
Phoenix:
(Officer Meekins should have seen him in the evidence room. That means the only place he could have been would be...)
Leads back to:
"Well then? Let's hear it."
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall was standing right here!
Judge:
There? But that's... That's where the victim, Detective Goodman, was!
Phoenix:
Correct... unless the man wasn't Detective Goodman. I believe the "victim" in the video is... Officer Marshall! It was you, dressed up like Detective Goodman!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But that's preposterous! Officer Meekins witnessed the detective at the crime scene! Once he saw the man's face, he'd know for sure!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
May I point out though, that Officer Meekins did not know Detective Goodman. He also testified about the man's reaction when confronted.
Meekins:
When I entered the evidence room, I asked him to show his card, sir!
Phoenix:
Yes? And how did Detective Goodman respond?
Meekins:
He suddenly pulled a knife on me!
Phoenix:
Something about the Officer's story puzzled me. If the man had his ID card, why didn't he just show it?
Judge:
Yes, he would have needed it to enter the evidence room, so he must have been carrying it.
Phoenix:
The answer is simple. He couldn't show it.
Edgeworth:!
Phoenix:
As you can see, Detective Goodman's picture is on his ID card.
Judge:
Oh, I get it.
Phoenix:
If he showed that, his cover would have been blown! Officer Meekins would have realized the man wasn't Detective Goodman. Do you have anything to say to this, Officer Marshall?
Marshall:
... You've got quite an imagination, pardner. We got a term for that. It's called "circumstantial evidence."
Phoenix:
Circumstantial evidence...? (He's still denying it!)
Marshall:
You're gonna have to do better than that to break a detective. Unless you have hard evidence proving I dressed up as the victim...
Judge:
Hmm... I can't say I particularly care for your uncooperative disposition...
Marshall:
I can't say I care for your beard, but you don't see me complainin'.
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Do you have any evidence? Any evidence proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that Officer Marshall dressed up as the victim?
Phoenix:
Well... (Who am I kidding? I don't have anything like that...)
Marshall:
I can see the fear in your eyes, pardner. Seems you're the one who couldn't take the desert heat!
Phoenix:
Ack! (This can't be happening! It's so obvious he's the one! What can I do...?)
Edgeworth:
... Hmph. It looks like your lack of experience has finally been exposed.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
I'll pass onto you what someone told me when I was just starting out. When you've run into a wall with no place to go, return to the basics.
Phoenix:
The basics... (For me, that would be what Mia used to tell me!)
Nick! Try thinking outside of the box!
Phoenix:
(I shouldn't look for proof that Officer Marshall was in disguise... but rather I should look for evidence that came about because he was in disguise!)
Edgeworth:
Why do you think this locker was opened in the first place?
Judge:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
There's no reason for Officer Marshall to open his locker at the time of the crime. Yet he did, despite the chance that it might be discovered later as it has been.
Phoenix:
(Which means he didn't originally plan to open his locker...!)
Judge:
According to the defense's argument, Officer Jake Marshall dressed up as Detective Goodman at the time of the crime. Then, after the crime was "committed," he opened his own locker for some unknown reason.
Edgeworth:
The fact that a white "cloth" is sticking out of the locker seems to indicate that he opened it in order to put the cloth inside.
Judge:
So... just what exactly is this piece of cloth?
Phoenix:
Perhaps... Perhaps the video is the key to all our unanswered questions. (I don't have any evidence, so this video's my only shot!)
Marshall:
...
Judge:
Very well. Let's take yet another look at the security tape. After commiting the crime, the witness opened the locker to put away the white cloth. Please show us why the witness had to open his locker!
Present Blood-soaked coat
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"For some reason, you disguised yourself as Detective Goodman,"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well, what do you have to say to that!?
Marshall:
Alright, pardner. You really want to know the reason I had to open my locker?
Phoenix:
Why?
Marshall:
So I could stuff you in there!
Phoenix:
Huh!?
Marshall:
I'm sure the world would be a better place with you sent off to the boneyard.
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately unsolved cases can't be stored in the evidence room.
Phoenix:
(Now I'm an "unsolved case"? Something went wrong in that evidence room... That's why Marshall had to open his locker. The accident itself is the reason! I'd better have another crack at this...)
Leads back to:
"According to the defense's argument, Officer Jake Marshall dressed up as Detective Goodman at the time of the crime."
Phoenix:
For some reason, you disguised yourself as Detective Goodman, and entered the evidence room. I don't know what that reason was... yet.
Marshall:
"Yet"?
Phoenix:
However, something unexpected happened. Officer Meekins barged in on you. When asked to show your ID card, you pulled a knife on him. However! Officer Meekins panicked, and the white coat you were wearing was soiled with blood!
Judge:
A bloody white coat...
Phoenix:
You couldn't just walk out like that, so you hid the coat in your locker.
Marshall:
... Not bad, huh "pardner"?
Judge:
Now then, Officer Marshall. Are you ready to tell us the truth?
Marshall:
Looks like I underestimated y'all. I hope you're happy now, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...
Marshall:
Two years ago... if you were only half as persistent then as you are today, we all wouldn't have to be here, now would we?
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall! Tell the court what you did... all of it.
Marshall:
Alright. It seems the time has come.
Witness Testimony
-- Marshall's Confession --
Marshall:
I had to do it that day. I couldn't just stand by and let it die.
I stole the detective's ID and dressed like him. I planned to take out the evidence.
I wasn't expecting Officer Meekins. I knocked him out...
and managed to escape. I knew which areas wouldn't be caught on the camera.
There wasn't any murder in the evidence room at 5:15.
Judge:
So the supposed "victim" was really you...
Edgeworth:
But there's one thing I still don't understand. Large quantities of blood traces were found on the floor of the evidence room. If no one was murdered, then how could that be?
Marshall:
Officer Meekins managed to cut his own hand. My guess is he's the donor.
Phoenix:
(It looked like too much blood for that...)

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
When you say "it," you mean...
Marshall:
Do you even have to ask, pardner?
Phoenix:
(The SL-9 Incident...)
Edgeworth:
Two years have passed since that case was closed. It was going to completely end with the transferal that day.
Marshall:
Not if I have anything to do with it. That incident's not over!
Phoenix:
But what did you hope to accomplish by sneaking into the evidence room?
Marshall:
When a case is closed, only the detective who was in charge of it can look through the evidence. I wanted to have a look at it myself one more time... no matter what the cost. I don't care what anyone says, pardner. That case is mine.
Phoenix:
(But Officer Marshall wasn't in charge of that investigation. Why does he care so much about it?)
Marshall:
That day was my last chance. That's why I...
After pressing all other statements
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall. May I ask you one thing?
Marshall:
Fire away, pardner. It's a free country. Just remember, I'm also free to decide whether or not to answer.
Phoenix:
Why did you do this? Stealing a detective's ID, injuring a police officer... This is no small offense!
Edgeworth:
Moreover, you're an officer yourself. This will have serious consequences. It can't just be forgiven with a simple cut in salary.
Phoenix:
(Not that salary cuts are ever a valid solution...)
Marshall:
... Like I said. This isn't your case. This one is mine. And I'll do anything it takes to get an answer I'm satisfied with.
Judge:
Hmm... The witness has an unusual amount of zeal. Let's hear more.
Add statement:
"I can't just forget the SL-9 Incident... You know why?"
Marshall:
I stole the detective's ID and dressed like him. I planned to take out the evidence.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why did you disguise yourself as Detective Goodman?
Marshall:
If I didn't make it look like Goodman was carrying out the evidence transferal... I'd be arrested for stealing evidence, which wouldn't get me anywhere.
Edgeworth:
So you did it to fool the security camera.
Judge:
And the detective's ID card?
Marshall:
I stole that the morning of the incident.
Phoenix:
(So that really was why Goodman started filling out that lost item report.)
Marshall:
I returned his ID card. I left it on the floor in the Prosecutor's Office parking lot.
Phoenix:
(The ID card I found was left there by Officer Marshall!)
Edgeworth:
So essentially... You managed to succeed despite your lack of foresight.
Marshall:
What do you mean... pardner?
Edgeworth:
I mean the fingerprint- activated lock, of course. No matter how well you disguise yourself, you can't change your fingerprints. Normally, that locker shouldn't have opened.
Phoenix:
(So it opened because a rubber glove was stuck in the door by chance...? Then Detective Goodman must have opened the locker before Officer Marshall!)

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You pulled a knife on Officer Meekins and tried to drive him off?
Marshall:
Let's just say I was a little surprised. I only planned on being in the evidence room for no more than five minutes. I didn't think anyone would actually come in during that short time.
Judge:
Officer Meekins... certainly is a one-in-a- million type of person. Mistaking a detective for an intruder and demanding to be shown his ID...
Edgeworth:
I'll have to think a little more about his raise this year...
Phoenix:
(When did Edgeworth get so much influence...?)
Marshall:
Anyway, he threw himself at me, and I ended up cutting him slightly. I'm sorry it had to turn out that way... with me knocking him out and everything.
Phoenix:
By the way, what happened to your knife?
Marshall:
Oh, you mean this one?
Phoenix:
... (I don't know what to say...)

Hmm... So, what happened next?

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you did your research beforehand.
Marshall:
Those who go into the desert unprepared don't live long, pardner. I didn't think it would make a difference though. The security tape is erased every six hours. If all had gone as planned, no footage would have been left.
Edgeworth:
However... You bloodied your coat in your struggle with Officer Meekins.
Marshall:
If someone was in the security room when I came out, the jig would have been up. I opened my locker and stashed it in there.
Phoenix:
What was Officer Meekins doing during that time?
Marshall:
What else? He was sleeping like a baby.
Judge:
So what you're saying is, on that day...

Marshall:
What are you, blind? The "victim" shown on that tape is me, and I'm not dead yet, pardner.
Edgeworth:
So, you stole the evidence from the locker?
Marshall:
Actually... no, I didn't.
Edgeworth:
Why not?
Marshall:
When I opened the locker, the evidence was already gone.
Judge:
What!? Mr. Edgeworth. Where is that evidence?
Edgeworth:
It's still missing, Your Honor.

Phoenix:
But that case was solved two years ago, wasn't it?
Judge:
That's the reason the evidence was stored in the evidence room.
Edgeworth:
Joe Darke was convicted for those crimes. One thing I can say for sure, he deserved his sentence.
Judge:
I remember the Joe Darke case... It involved serial murders, didn't it?
Marshall:
I don't intend to complain about how it turned out, but there's something that still bothers me. Something went down at that trial. Something no one will talk about.
Judge:
What happened?
Marshall:
I don't know. That's what I'm trying to find out.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Why is he so concerned with that incident? Maybe I should present him with what I think his real reason is...)
Present SL-9 Incident Files
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Officer Marshall, I think I understand."
Phoenix:
(I had a feeling we'd wind up here sooner or later... Everyone involved here is related in some way to that case... I'd better take another look at the files.)
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall, I think I understand. I think I know why you care so much about the SL-9 Incident.
Marshall:
Sounds like you've been sipping too much cactus juice, pardner.
Phoenix:
I have the SL-9 Incident file here. The name "Marshall" is mentioned in here...
Marshall:!
Phoenix:
in a list of murder victims. "Neil Marshall"... Are you related to this man?
Edgeworth:
Neil Marshall...?
Marshall:
Yeah, I'm sure you've heard the name. Two years ago... he received the same lousy prosecutor award you got.
Judge:
What!? A prosecutor...?
Phoenix:
(He must be talking about the King of Prosecutors award.)
Edgeworth:
Now I remember... Prosecutor Neil Marshall. He handled the SL-9 case before I did.
Marshall:
That's right. He was killed... and the case fell into your hands.
Judge:
But what's his relation to you...?
Marshall:
He was my brother. He was investigating the murders with Damon Gant, Chief Detective at the time. The group of detectives I was part of worked under them. We were desperate to prosecute the killer. Joe Darke... My brother fought Darke and was killed. That was the first time Darke left behind any evidence. That was all we needed. He was arraigned and incarcerated. The case was finally closed... at least, according to the public records.
Judge:
What do you mean?
Marshall:
My brother couldn't have been killed by Joe Darke. I knew my brother better than anyone... No one could have beaten him in a fight.
Edgeworth:
And that's it? That's your reason for your insane actions?
Marshall:
There's more to my brother's death than what the records say. No matter how much you try to hide it, you can't fool me.
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
Well... at least one thing's for certain. Now we know what happened at the Police Department on the day of the crime.
Edgeworth:
That was the last day the SL-9 case could be reopened. Not satisfied with its resolution, Officer Marshall planned to steal the evidence.
Phoenix:
Disguising himself as Detective Goodman, he entered the evidence room. Officer Meekins confronted him, so he rendered him unconscious and fled.
Edgeworth:
Yes, this mystery has finally been cleared up. No murder took place at the Police Department that day!
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
The things that happen by chance never cease to amaze... At exactly the same time as the murder at the Prosecutor's Office... this fake murder was going on at the Police Department.
Phoenix:
(Chance...? It's got to be more than just that...)
Judge:
So if no one was murdered at the Police Department on the day of the crime, that means the murder in the Prosecutor's Office's parking lot was the real one.
Edgeworth:
Which, in turn, means... only one person could have committed the crime: Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
B-but wait! A verdict wasn't reached in yesterday's trial!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Which is why we examined the incident at the Police Department today.
Phoenix:
But...!
Edgeworth:
There's only one reason the defendant was not convicted yesterday: there yet remained the mystery of the simultaneous murder at the Police Department.
Marshall:
It seems to me... this boy's got the draw on you, pardner.
Edgeworth:
All the mysteries at the Police Department have been uncovered. No contradictions remain. The murder took place at the Prosecutor's Office! The only suspect is Lana Skye. There were no errors in the testimony of the witness, Angel Starr! If you have a response... make it one word or less.
Phoenix:
... ARRRGHHHH!!!
Edgeworth:
I rest my case.
Judge:
It seems this trial has reached its conclusion. There's no room for doubt.
Edgeworth:
Well done, Mr. Wright. Thanks to you, I didn't need to waste my time... disproving the alleged "murder" at the Police Department.
Phoenix:
(There's no doubt what I proved today is true... The apparent murder on the security camera's tape really was fake! But I didn't realize... that would end up proving Lana guilty!)
Judge:
Now then, the time for the verdict has arrived. This court finds the defendant...
Hold it!
Ema:
Y-your Honor! Wait!
Phoenix:
Ema!
Ema:
The defense has an objection. A scientific objection! Right?
Phoenix:
What do you mean, "right?"
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Are you this girl's guardian?
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Oh, uh... in a sense...
Ema:
Please, Your Honor. All I'm asking is for a minute of your time! Please hear me out! Mr. Edgeworth, please...
Edgeworth:
... I don't want to leave any loose ends. You want a minute? I'll give you three.
Ema:
I... I was kind of in shock. I mean, finding out that the SL-9 incident referred to the Joe Darke Killings!
Phoenix:
(Now that she mentions it... the names of both Skye sisters were in that file.)
Ema:
But that's when I figured it out. I mean, what Officer Marshall was trying to do that day... So I knew his fingerprint had nothing to do with the crime. That left only one thing... the other handprint!
Edgeworth:
You mean the traces of blood found on Detective Gumshoe's locker...
Judge:
But no fingerprints were found on it, right?
Ema:
No, but I figured if I examined it scientifically... I'd be sure to find a clue! So I ran over there and looked at it again!
Phoenix:! So did you find something?
Ema:
Um... No!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
Sorry. I guess I'm not much of a scientific investigator after all.
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
Um... Is that all?
Ema:
Please don't be mad. I'm just a high school student!
Phoenix:
(And I'm just an attorney...)
Ema:
But Mr. Wright! Those traces of blood are the only clue we have! If we can't find something wrong with them... Please, Mr. Wright. You're a professional. If anyone can save Lana, it's you!
Phoenix:
Me? Oh boy...
Judge:
Time's up. Now then, Mr. Wright. With regard to the incident at the Police Department... Does any reasonable doubt remain?
Phoenix:
Um...
Edgeworth:
It appears the defense is troubled by the other blood mark. Looking at the floor plans, a handprint was discovered around here. Is there a problem with this?
Ema:
Mr. Wright! I'm sorry I can't be of more use... But still! If you can't find anything wrong with that blood mark, Lana will be...
Judge:
Please answer my question, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (If ever I've needed to concentrate, it's now! What could be wrong with that handprint on Detective Gumshoe's locker? Could there be something I'm missing...?)
I object!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"This handprint left at the crime scene..."
There's no problem!
Phoenix:
(I've got to be honest... I don't see anything wrong with it! Still... If I give up now, Lana's going to be convicted for sure...)
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"This handprint left at the crime scene..."
Phoenix:
This handprint left at the crime scene... clearly shows a contradiction!
Edgeworth:
The only thing that seems clear is you're grasping, Mr. Wright.
Judge:
You've been staring pretty intently at those floor plans. Tell me... is there a problem with them?
Phoenix:
... (Yes, this is strange...!) Take a good look at these floor plans. Something is missing.
Edgeworth:
"Missing"...? You mean, something hasn't been drawn on there?
Phoenix:
Yes. Something that, when drawn, will completely change the meaning of the blood mark!
Judge:
Let us pray the defense isn't simply trying to buy time. Very well, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(With all this evidence here... there's got to be something I can use!)
Judge:
The question is... which item can prove something is missing in the floor plans?
Present Blue Badger Panel
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"What about that piece of plywood?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Marshall:
As they say back west... "Even a blind man can hit with buckshot." That is... so long as he's facin' the general direction.
Edgeworth:
It seems Mr. Wright's not sure which direction to face.
Phoenix:
(It's no use! The more evidence there is, the more wrong choices!)
Ema:
Just calm down, Mr. Wright. Try and remember what the evidence room was like on the day of the crime!
Phoenix:
(What is it that bothers me about this blood mark..?) Please allow me another chance, Your Honor. I'll prove it this time!
Leads back to:
"Let us pray the defense isn't simply trying to buy time."
Marshall:
What about that piece of plywood?
Phoenix:
The Blue Badger! Mascot of the police force! Defender of truth, guardian of proof!
Edgeworth:
Explain yourself, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Please look at the floor plans of the crime scene. The Blue Badger is not here.
Marshall:
So?
Phoenix:
So watch what happens when we put him in. This is where he was dancing at the time of the crime. Well...?
Judge:
Well... what?
Edgeworth:! *gasp!*
Phoenix:
That's right. So long as the Blue Badger is dancing here... it would be impossible... to place a handprint at this spot on the locker!
Marshall:
Whaaaaat!?
Judge:
So that means... Uh... just exactly what does that mean!?
Phoenix:
It means it can't be done!
Judge:
What are you saying? Blood traces were undeniably found on that locker!
Phoenix:
Don't look at me, I didn't put it there!
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Think it through scientifically!
Phoenix:
Ema!
Ema:
On that afternoon... Officer Meekins was the one who brought the Blue Badger to the evidence room, right? After he put it down, it would be impossible to leave a handprint on that locker.
Phoenix:
...! So that must mean this blood mark... was left there before the Blue Badger was brought in...?
Judge:
Just one moment! I will not allow such farfetched balderdash in my courtroom!
Phoenix:
It may sound farfetched, Your Honor... but it's the only possible explanation! On February 21st... in the Police Department's evidence room... blood was spilled not once, but twice!
Edgeworth:
B-but how...!
Phoenix:
One time was captured on this tape, taken by the security camera. Officer Meekins cut his hand, from which a trivial amount of blood fell. The problem is... the "other" time. Someone bled prior to the struggle shown on this tape. It had to have been... Detective Goodman, when he was really murdered!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That's ridiculous! I refute you!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The murder portrayed in the security tape has been proven to be a fake. However! That does not explain the blood mark found on the locker!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
So then... assuming this "murder" you purport really happened. When did it take place!? I demand you show evidence that proves it occurred!
Phoenix:
(When did the first incident occur...)
Judge:
To surmise, the defense claims that... prior to Officer Meekins being cut by Jake Marshall, who was disguised as Detective Goodman, another "incident" took place in that evidence room.
Phoenix:
The blood mark on the locker proves this.
Judge:
Very well. Then tell us... When did this "first" incident occur? Proof must be presented.
Phoenix:
(Proof that shows when the murder took place... There's only one piece of evidence that can show that!)
Judge:
Now then. Will the defense please present its evidence? What shows when the "first" crime took place?
Present ID Card Record
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"If the crime took place inside the evidence room, then the perpetrator would had to have"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is the proof! It's quite simple, you see.
Edgeworth:
If it's so simple, then don't get it wrong.
Phoenix:
... Huh?
Judge:
If "huh" was an acceptable excuse, we wouldn't need police.
Ema:
The first crime took place before the Blue Badger was brought to the room, right? Say... When was the Blue Badger brought there, anyway?
Phoenix:
Don't we have a time chart among our evidence items that lists the time?
Leads back to:
"(Proof that shows when the murder took place...)"
Phoenix:
If the crime took place inside the evidence room, then the perpetrator would had to have entered the room. In order to do so, an ID card is required.
Judge:
An ID card... Oh! The ID Card Record!
Phoenix:
Officer Meekins brought the Blue Badger panel into the evidence room at...
Judge:
Let's see here... 4:50 PM. If the crime took place before that time, then it would be... 4:40 PM... Ah! AAAAAAAHHH! M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-Miles Edgeworth! Just what have you done!?
Marshall:
I never figured you had nerve, boy.
Edgeworth:
Put off the act, witness. It doesn't take a lot of thought to figure out it couldn't have been me.
Marshall:
Hmm... Nope, I ain't gettin' it...
Judge:
Hmm... I'm afraid I don't understand either.
Edgeworth:
It's clear from the luminol test that blood was there. However, when the "second" crime took place... both Officer Meekins and Officer Marshall failed to notice the blood.
Phoenix:
That means... the blood from the first crime was wiped away... by the real murderer.
Edgeworth:
I would have had just ten minutes to murder the victim, carry his body away, and clean up the blood... Unfortunately that's physically impossible.
Judge:
That would mean... the crime must have taken place before Mr. Edgeworth entered the evidence room.
Phoenix:
Let's look at the chart again. There's only one other card number remaining: "7777777"!
Marshall:
Talk about a lucky number...
Judge:
But wait... That doesn't make sense! How could Officer Goodman have entered the evidence room?
Phoenix:
Since there's no record of his card being used beforehand... he must have entered along with the real murderer. That's the only plausible explanation. He went in with "7777777"!
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth! Please look into this ASAP! Find out whose ID number is "sevensevensevensevensevensevensevenseven"!
Edgeworth:
That's one "seven" too many, Your Honor. Unfortunately... I'm unable to look up the owner of that ID card. At least, at present.
Phoenix:
What!?
Marshall:
Explain yourself, son.
Edgeworth:
The ID number "7777777" belongs to someone with a rank of Captain or higher... Someone who is a so-called "executive officer." We don't have the authority to inquire into such a person's identity.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But that's ridiculous! Just how...
Edgeworth:
I'm not finished talking, Mr. Wright. There is one situation in which we can be granted such authority.
Judge:
If an official charge filed against an executive is accepted.
Phoenix:
An "official charge"...
Marshall:
You're all alike, aren't you? With your "cover-ups" and your "forgeries"... That's how the Prosecutor's Office operates!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I take pride in my work, Officer Marshall. I would appreciate it if you would keep your slander to yourself.
Marshall:
"Slander," is it? Okay. Let me ask a question.
Edgeworth:
Yes?
Marshall:
No, not to you. To her, the defendant sitting over there. Your own little "executive."
Phoenix:
(L-Lana?)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Don't be stupid. She's been charged with murder. Of course we've looked up her ID number... and it's not "7777777."
Marshall:
Don't play me for a fool, pardner. That's not what I want to ask. All I want to know is one thing... about that incident.
Judge:
The SL-9 Incident?
Marshall:
Answer me this, Chief Prosecutor! In that trial two years ago... Did you really only use legitimate evidence!?
Edgeworth:
Do you need the witness to repeat his question, Chief Prosecutor?
Lana:
I heard him fine, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Two years ago... I was in charge of the prosecution for that trial. At the time, we...
Lana:
Occasionally... we felt the powerlessness of the law. At least... I did.
Phoenix:
...!
Ema:
L-Lana...
Lana:
I became a prosecutor in order to suppress crime with the law. But before I realized it, we were the ones being suppressed by the law.
Judge:
Defendant! Just what are you saying!?
Marshall:
I'll ask you again, Chief Prosecutor. During that trial two years ago... did you really present all the evidence in court? Can you look me, an investigator in that crime, in the eye and say that you did?
Judge:
Chief Prosecutor! You didn't...
Lana:
... I don't have to, Officer Marshall.
Edgeworth:! Why don't you answer him!?
Lana:
Drastic crimes require drastic measures... That's just the way it is. We did what we had to... in order for him to get the verdict he deserved.
Ema:
But Lana!
Lana:
Even if it involved "forging" evidence.
Marshall:
See? That's what I'm talking about.
Edgeworth:
No... NNNNOOOOOOO!!!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ORDERRRRR!!!
Lana's remarks caused such a stir... the chaos in the courtroom could not be quelled. The conclusion of the trial... would have to wait until the following day...
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!

Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:

Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over
