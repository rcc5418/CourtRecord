February 23, 2:15 PMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Ema:
Uh... um, Mr. Wright! So... What's going on with the case, anyway!? I... I'm a little confused.
Phoenix:
Huh!? W-well, um... let's see. (What is going on?) The victim, Detective Bruce Goodman, was stabbed to death after&#160;5:00 PM on the 21st. He died in the Prosecutor's parking lot... and the Police Department's evidence room.
Ema:
What's this "and the evidence room" part!? The Prosecutor's Office and the Police Department are 30 minutes apart by car.
Phoenix:
... Well... that's what we're going to find out. (Or try to, at least...)
Ema:
... Alright! Let's do it!
Phoenix:
(Glad she's in good spirits, but I'm not sure she's going to be much help with this...)
Ema:
Don't be so sure, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
Would you mind coming with me? I'll prove that these thick- rimmed glasses of mine aren't just for show! Let's go! Science awaits us!
February 23Prosecutor's OfficeUnderground Parking Lot
Ema:
You know, I really don't think we should worry about the Police Department murder! There wasn't even a body found there! Who cares?
Phoenix:
(Of course it was our victim who was killed at the Department...)
Ema:
And my sister would never do such a thing! I know it...
Edgeworth:
That oil drum... Was it empty?
Angel:
The oil drum kicked over by the Chief Prosecutor... was brimming with water!
Ema:
My sister, erasing evidence at the crime scene? Never!
Phoenix:
(Even though she says they don't get along, Ema really likes her sister...)
Ema:
That's not it at all! It's just... We're both professionals at what we do... and I trust her!
Phoenix:
(Big words for a high school student.) Well, whether there was blood stains or not... The water in that oil drum washed it all away.
Ema:
He he heh. Ignore the strength of my science at your own peril, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Huh? What's that grin for?
Ema:
This situation calls for one thing, and that is... Luminol testing fluid!
Phoenix:
L-luminol?
Ema:
Blood is sticky stuff, you know. You can't just wash it away with a little water. Even if you can't see it, it's still there...
Phoenix:
But wouldn't the police have already done those tests?
Ema:
Never trust anyone's eyes but your own, Mr. Wright! Just give it a try!
Phoenix:
M-me? Why do I have to do it!?
Ema:
I'm a minor! I can't even drink yet!
Phoenix:
(We're testing blood stains with this stuff, not drinking it...)
Ema:
Here, look, I'll lend you these glasses.
Phoenix:
Huh? You had an extra pair of those things?
Ema:
To test for a blood reaction, just spray the luminol on it. Like this, see? Touch the screen to spray it on. Okay! Let's find us some bloodstains!
Spray luminol between oil drum and car
Leads to:
"(I can see her eyes shining behind those glasses...)"
Phoenix:
(I can see her eyes shining behind those glasses...) So, is this a bloodstain?
Ema:
Uhhhh... It's so... ugh!
Phoenix:
Ema, you're shaking.
Ema:
It's just... this is my first time seeing real blood!
Phoenix:
(Scientific investigation in action...)
Ema:
O-okay, well, we definitely know that this is a bloodstain. But, doesn't something strike you as odd? Scientifically speaking, of course?
Phoenix:
(What's odd about this... scientifically?)
The bloodstain's location
Phoenix:
Why, the blood stain's location is odd! Elementary!
Ema:
H-huh? Why is that "elementary"? I mean, I would think that if there was a fight, you'd expect some bloodstains here.
Phoenix:
... I suppose you might think that.
Ema:
C'mon, Mr. Wright! We're all counting on you!
Phoenix:
(There is something odd about this bloodstain... But if it's not the location of the blood, then maybe...) Maybe it's the amount of blood that's odd?
Leads to:
"I definitely think so!"
The amount of blood
Phoenix:
The perpetrator and Detective Goodman fought here, right? Don't you think there'd be a little more blood?
Leads to:
"I definitely think so!"
Ema:
I definitely think so! I mean... Look at all the blood on the sole of the victim's shoe!
Phoenix:
(It's strange! If they fought here, there'd have to be more bloodstains than this.)
Ema:
Uh, h-hey, Mr. Wright! See how I'm marking up the floor plans when we find a blood stain? See... I'm pretty handy to have around, right?
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. That's very... useful information to have.
Ema:
I saved up my allowance to buy this!
Phoenix:
Luminol Testing Fluid information received from Ema.
Ema:
We can't be sure that the police will reveal all their evidence in court. Sometimes they fail to mention evidence that doesn't fit with their view of the case.
Phoenix:
And we'll drag that "hidden evidence" out into the light of day!
Ema:
Yeah! It feels like we're really investigating a crime now, doesn't it?
Phoenix:
(This luminol stuff is going to come in handy.)
???:
Hah!
Angel:
I wonder how that fluid of yours would react to a nice Deli Box?
Ema:
Ms. Starr!
Angel:
You only trust your own eyes, hm? Not bad,&#160;you two... This day-old Deli Box is on the house...
Phoenix:
Sorry, it's just, that kind of lead in doesn't really get my mouth watering.
Examine (left side)
Security room
Ema:
So that's where Ms. Starr saw the incident from.
Phoenix:
You can probably see quite a lot from up there. (Hmm... That probably means she wasn't lying when she saw Ms. Skye stab him...) Where's the security guard, anyway?
Ema:
Well, this is just something I heard... But apparently he went out to buy coffee for Ms. Starr.
Phoenix:
(That woman is a force to be reckoned with...)
Wall
Ema:
So, this is the famous divider.
Phoenix:
It sure helped us knock a hole in that testimony today. Come to think of it, this divider helped our case more than the actual witness.
Ema:
The great divider! A chip off the old parking block!
Phoenix:
It's just a wall. (Scientifically speaking...)
Oil drum
Phoenix:
So, this is the famous oil drum.
Ema:
Well, no time like the present! I'll try to kick it over myself! Hii-yah! ......
Phoenix:
Th-that's okay. Don't cry. (That Lana Skye must be a powerful woman...)
Examine (right side)
Car
Ema:
That's about as red as a sports car can get.
Phoenix:
Yup, it's pretty red alright. (The body was found in Edgeworth's car trunk... And the lock on the trunk was broken too... So, the question is why did Ms. Skye chose his car?)
Ema:
So, what model car is it?
Phoenix:
... I think it was called a "Sedan" or a "Coupe." Something like that.
Ema:
Those are car types, Mr. Wright. Not models. You're a guy, aren't you, Mr. Wright? Your supposed to know these things!
Phoenix:
(Maybe it is about time I got my driver's license...)
Trunk
Ema:
That's where we found that note.
Phoenix:
"2/21 SL-9"... The SL-9 Incident.
Ema:
A case that was due for transferal the day of the murder.
Phoenix:
(And the detective in charge of the case was the victim.)
Ema:
I wonder what kind of case this SL-9 Incident thing was?
Phoenix:
It's kind of hard to guess just knowing the case number.
Fence
Phoenix:
"B Block" is through there. That's where visitors park.
Ema:
So... Ms. Starr climbed over this fence!?
Phoenix:
I-it seems so, yeah. (That fence is 9 feet high at least!)
Ema:
Well no time like the present! I think I'll give it a little try! Eeeek! ......
Phoenix:
I-it's okay, don't cry. (Maybe there's a Lunchland Olympics team?)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Angel:
That looks like a petrified piece of provolone.
Phoenix:
Huh? I-it's not! It's my attorney's badge!
Angel:
... I'd think a petrified piece of provolone would fetch more on the open market.
Phoenix:
Look, my badge isn't up for sale. Not yet, at least.
Goodman's ID
Angel:
I had one of those up until two years ago...
Ema:
Back when you were the Cough-up Queen, right?
Phoenix:
We found this ID card here in this parking lot...
Angel:
Well, there's no mistaking that. It's definitely Goodman's.
Phoenix:
But... It's the same ID as the man who was killed at the Police Department.
Angel:
... That's impossible.
Phoenix:
(I wish I could be so sure...)
Edgeworth's Knife
Phoenix:
A body with Edgeworth's knife stuck in it was found in Edgeworth's car.
Angel:
I'd think he owes me his gratitude.
Phoenix:
Gratitude?
Angel:
Why, if I hadn't witnessed the crime...
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth would have been the suspect!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I wonder.)
Angel:
Still, it's strange. Why didn't our Chief Prosecutor have her own murder weapon ready?
Victim's Note or Switchblade Knife
Ema:
Um... What do you think about this?
Angel:
"SL-9 Incident"... On that knife... And on that note... Goodman... Goodman was the head detective on that case, you know.
Ema:
Really?
Angel:
That knife was evidence from that case... the murder weapon. It was due for transferal the very day that Goodman was killed. As I suspected... SL-9 isn't over! Not yet!
Phoenix:
Do you think you could tell us more about the SL-9 Incident?
Lana's Cell Phone
Angel:
It was when I grabbed the Chief Prosecutor on the shoulder... She dropped that phone on the pavement.
Phoenix:
That's when you heard her talking about the "muffler," right?
Angel:
Little did I know... it was a trap! The red car's muffler, and the prosecutor's red muffler!
Phoenix:
(What was Ms. Skye really trying to say, I wonder?)
Crime Photo
Angel:
If you think about it, I could have taken that picture from the guard room. But... even I get flustered sometimes.
Phoenix:
So, you went straight to the scene of the crime?
Angel:
And climbed the chain link fence in an effort to stop the murder? That's when I took this photo, yes.
Ema:
In other words... five minutes after the crime?
Angel:
Those five minutes are the whole problem... The hole in my testimony, as it were.
Ema:
The five minutes weren't the problem, Ms. Starr, you lying was the problem!
Angel:
Listen, little girl. I've had my testimony "disregarded" before... And I wasn't going to have it disregarded again! Just like that time...
Phoenix:
(That time...?)
Anything else
Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this?
Angel:
You!
Phoenix:
Y-yes!?
Angel:
You said you wanted some hot tea, right?
Phoenix:
Uh, no, but thanks. (She didn't even look at it.)
Ema:
Mmm! You must have to brew the leaves a long time to get rich flavor like this!
Angel:
We "pre-infuse"&#160;the leaves with steam before brewing.
Ema:
I knew it! So that's the secret to their aroma! Exquisite!
Phoenix:
(The only thing I'm smelling here is wasted time...)
Examine evidence
Bottom of Luminol Testing Fluid
Phoenix:
(Someone used a marker to write their name on this.) "Ema Skye" Don't tell me you bring this with you everywhere you go.
Ema:
Well, you never know where something might go down!
Phoenix:
(Just what kind of a world do you think we live in...?)
Spray luminol
Phone
Phoenix:
This blood must be from when Lana...
Ema:
No! My sister isn't the murderer!
Phoenix:
But she did call you, didn't she? At the time of the crime?
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
And her right hand is bandaged.
Ema:
Hey! Just whose side are you on!?
Phoenix:
This has nothing to do with "taking sides." (So... This means that Lana's hand had blood on it. This just keeps getting worse...)

Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.
Ema:
Oh, I tried studying one of those just now. Remember what they were talking about in the trial today...?
Phoenix:
Oh, right, evidence law. So, did you learn anything?
Ema:
Well, when I tried reading it made my head hurt.
Phoenix:
Oh...
Ema:
Then, when I closed it, it slipped out of my hand and fell on my foot.
Phoenix:
(Oddly enough I find myself identifying with her on this one...)
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
Mia's plant, "Charley." I've been taking care of him in Maya's absence. Huh? He looks a little yellow today...
Ema:
Oh, I watered him just now. I mixed in a lot, too.
Phoenix:
Mixed in... what?
Ema:
Why my very own scientific additive! Well, Charley? You like it?
Phoenix:
I told you, he's turning yellow!
Mia's desk
Phoenix:
Mia's desk. I sit here even less now that I've stopped taking cases.
Ema:
Uh oh! I have a history test coming up next week! I'd better study! I'm borrowing this desk, okay? Let's see... George Washington was the first king of America...
Phoenix:
(Sorry, Mia...)
Window
Phoenix:
Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. Egad! The bellboy was staring right at me.
Ema:
He looks wimpy, but you can tell, there's a sharp edge under that facade. That bellboy is going to be someone someday.
Phoenix:
(Wish someone would say that about me...)
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
Well... where should we begin?
Ema:
Oh, well, isn't it obvious? We should begin with that, y'know... that thing.
Phoenix:
The mystery of the victim I guess. How could one man, Detective Goodman... be killed in two places simultaneously?
Ema:
Oh, well, you see...
Phoenix:
We should go to the Police Department... the evidence room was it?
Ema:
Uh... I'm not being very useful here, am I...
Phoenix:
(No, no! You're being very... helpful.)
Any ideas
Ema:
Poor Mr. Edgeworth...
Gant:
You are becoming a thorn in my side, Worthy... There've been rumors... After all, you were in the defendant's chair just last year...!
Edgeworth:
...!
Ema:
There was that business with him not reading that officer's report...
Phoenix:
Ah, about the killing at the Police Department, right. (The Chief of Police was right about that... But I can't help but think... Someone at the Police Department doesn't like Edgeworth...)
Present
Goodman's ID
Ema:
That number was the clincher, wasn't it!
Phoenix:
5842189... It's in the record.
Ema:
The ID number of the detective killed at the Police Department that day at 5:15. But... we found this card in the parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
... (Something to think about later when I'm not so busy.)
Ema:
Don't leave me here to do all the thinking alone!
Prosecutor Trophy
Ema:
I bet you'd be pretty happy with a "King of Attorneys" shield, too, huh?
Phoenix:
We defense attorneys are a scattered, unrecognized bunch.
Ema:
Still... I wonder why the trophy shield is broken?
Phoenix:
It is pretty odd, huh? (I doubt it has anything to do with this case though...)
Edgeworth's Knife
Ema:
So... Mr. Edgeworth's knife was the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
Right... or so the witness, Ms. Starr, claims. She saw your sister stab Mr. Goodman with this knife.
Ema:
Ugh... You know, all of this is that Angel Starr's fault!
Phoenix:
She's not the one on trial here.
Ema:
Well, no, but she must have seen it wrong!
Phoenix:
Her eyesight isn't on trial here, either.
Lana's Cell Phone
Phoenix:
According to Ms. Starr's testimony... Ms. Skye used her phone right after the murder... she called you, right?
Ema:
B-but...! She hung up right away. And it was a bad connection. I couldn't hear anything.
Phoenix:
(Because it was an underground parking lot, I suppose...)
Ema:
She did say something about a "muffler"... but got cut off...
Crime Photo
Ema:
Th-this photograph... Ms. Starr must have been seeing things!
Phoenix:
And photographing things? (This proves Ms. Skye was there at the scene of the crime! She is connected to this crime somehow... but how?)
Switchblade Knife
Phoenix:
Why would this have been in the car's exhaust pipe?
Ema:
It's evidence from an old case, right?
Phoenix:
Right... the SL-9 incident. It was already solved, apparently. (This knife was stolen on the day of the evidence transferal... Maybe I should look into this "S-L9 ([sic]) Incident"...)
Luminol Testing Fluid
Ema:
This stuff is pretty expensive.
Phoenix:
You don't say. How much does it cost?
Ema:
I'd say about $10 per gram! I save up my allowance to buy it.
Phoenix:
Your allowance...? Does your sister give you that?
Ema:
Yes. We don't have parents...
Phoenix:
R-right...
Ema:
Sometimes she even gives me a bottle instead of my allowance!
Phoenix:
A bottle of luminol testing fluid...? (Man, I'd just take the allowance myself...)
February 23Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Phoenix:
Looks like Ms. Skye is in questioning...
Ema:
I hope the detectives aren't yelling at her... "How did you kill him in two places at the same time!" Can you imagine?
Phoenix:
How's she supposed to answer that! (Wait a second... The Chief said they'd caught the criminal at the Police Department!)
Ema:
Let's come back later!
Examine
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. One murder at the Prosecutor's Office... one at the Police Department... He must be frozen with fear thinking that he might be next...
Ema:
Don't scare the poor guy!
February 23High Prosecutor's OfficeRoom 1202
Ema:
Well, this place is certainly tidy today.
Phoenix:
And it will be tidy tomorrow, too. Incidentally, he's not here.
Ema:
I'm sure he's off doing important investigations!
Phoenix:
I hope that's what he's doing.
Ema:
...?
Phoenix:
(I guess we'll have to come back.)
Examine
Window
Ema:
Whoa! What a view! It must be nice to have an office on the 12th floor.
Phoenix:
I guess you would feel... important.
Ema:
Incidentally... Were you to jump out this window, the speed at the time of impact would be... ... Got it! Approximately 70.71 miles per hour!
Phoenix:
(That's handy to know...)
Trophy
Ema:
He won such a prestigious award. Why would he just leave it on the couch?
Phoenix:
Better this than that giant Steel Samurai. (Edgeworth has always been like that.)
Ema:
Really? Hey, I should write this down. Tell me what he was like as a kid!
Phoenix:
Back in elementary school, he won awards for all kinds of things. Speech contests, essays, playing the flute, golf tournaments...
Ema:
That doesn't exactly sound like typical elementary school stuff.
Phoenix:
But he always hated receiving awards. He'd make some smart remark like,
Edgeworth:
"I know the path I've walked. No one else needs to tell me."
Phoenix:
That's how he's always been.
Ema:
Kind of gets under your skin, doesn't it?
Spray luminol
Ground in front of desk
Ema:
What? It looks like some blood has dripped down here!
Phoenix:
Judging by the amount, my guess is it's from a nosebleed.
Ema:
A nosebleed, hm? Maybe in his wrath, Mr. Edgeworth slapped someone for their incompetence.
Phoenix:
(Why does Detective Gumshoe's face come to mind...?)
February 23Police DepartmentEntrance
Phoenix:
It's even busier here today than it was yesterday.
Ema:
The detectives are running around so fast they're blurring.
Phoenix:
(I suppose it makes sense--a detective did get killed in their own department.)
Ema:
So... the evidence room. The scene of the crime! According to the pamphlet we got at the front desk... Here it is!
Phoenix:
(She's like a kid at an amusement park.)
Ema:
Ooh, a real crime scene! Let's go take a look!
Examine
Blue Badger
Ema:
The Blue Badger is still writhing around today.
Phoenix:
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt and say he's dancing. (Speaking of "dancing"... The whole Police Department has been dancing around like crazy since yesterday...)
Ema:
Can I take out his batteries? I just can't help but feel he's going to do something naughty!
Officers
Phoenix:
Look, that patrolman is saluting the other guy. He must be a detective!
Police:
You idiot! What were you thinking!? Where's your head?
Patrolman:
S-sir, it's r-right here sir.
Ema:
... I guess he wasn't saluting, he was showing the detective where his head was.
Phoenix:
They make a good pair.

February 23Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs
Phoenix:
Wow, everyone looks deadly serious here...
Ema:
Well, there was a vicious murder of a detective in this department, after all.
Phoenix:
Yes, but the same detective was also killed at the same time in the Prosecutor's lot.
Ema:
Ugh... It makes my head hurt.
Phoenix:
Well, first things first. I want to check out the crime scene here.
Ema:
Yes, you sound "dead"-set on investigating! But don't mess up, or we could wind up... dead!
Phoenix:
I doubt anyone wants more mysteries or dead bodies around here right now. (But... it doesn't look like anyone's going to help us much, either.)
Examine
Poster
Phoenix:
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.
Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"I know! The killer used dry ice! If you put it between the latch and the door, the room could be sealed shut!" This is good! I'll win a writer's award for sure.
Phoenix:
... He's not writing a report... he's writing a novel.
Desk
Phoenix:
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.
Blue Badger
Phoenix:
So this is the police mascot, is it?
Chief:
The Blue Badger! The future star of the police force!
Ema:
The design's a little changed from the one outside...
Chief:
Ah, well, the Dancing Blue Badger(tm) is still under development, you see.
Ema:
You have it trademarked?
Chief:
Absolutely! It's cutting edge stuff. Very "now." I showed this doll here to my daughter and she burst into tears!
Phoenix:
(Don't show her the moving mock-up outside then, you'll give her nightmares.)
Chief
Phoenix:
That must be the Head Detective. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
Wha...!? "Detective killed in the evidence room"! "Tell no one outside the Police Department"!? Nooo! I told the old lady at the restaurant everything!
Phoenix:
(Someone's getting a demotion...)
February 23Evidence Room EntranceGuard Station
Phoenix:
What's with the decor in this place? It's very... eccentric.
Ema:
According to the pamphlet, this is the guard station for the evidence room.
Phoenix:
So, beyond that door is the evidence room... the scene of the crime?
Ema:
It sure seems that way... Oh. Ohhh...
Phoenix:
What's wrong?
Ema:
It's those cacti! They're so prickly... so imposing! It's hard to think straight.
Phoenix:
(If you can't handle the cacti, stay out of the desert...) What I want to know is, if this is a guard station, where is the guard?
Ema:
I have a feeling I know who this guard is already...
Examine
Ponchos
Ema:
There's a security guard uniform hanging there.
Phoenix:
It looks more like a costume than a uniform, honestly.
Ema:
A leather jacket, leather pants, a leather... What was that called again? A punchy? A paunchy? A pinchy? I know! A poochy! Hmm... Wait, maybe that wasn't it.
Phoenix:
(It's a "poncho," but I think I'll keep that information to myself for the time being.)
Cacti
Ema:
Yipes, that sure is prickly. It must be the real deal.
Phoenix:
I would think just one big one would be sufficient.
Ema:
This cactus... is a lot like my sister, actually.
Phoenix:
M-Ms. Skye?
Ema:
Encased in a cold, rigid shell, with thorns pointing in every direction... Just like her.
Phoenix:
... You know, I've been looking at this cactus a while now, and I don't see the resemblance.
Ema:
... It's more an attitude thing than a physical similarity.
Monitors
Phoenix:
It looks like there's a video feed from the evidence room here.
Ema:
There's a light blinking below the monitor. It says "Recording"! I bet we could use this computer to check on who went in and out of here!
Swinging door
Ema:
This swinging door makes the place look like some kind of saloon!
Phoenix:
But look, it's nailed shut. You can't get in that way.
Ema:
Of course not! If you went in through here.. The cactus would fall over. Ouch!
Phoenix:
I'd say it'd be more of an "Yeeeeaargh," myself.
Lasso
Ema:
Look, on the floor, a lasso!
Phoenix:
Hmm... looks like it's set up to trap something.
Ema:
A trap, here? Wait, I know! Maybe someone was trying to catch a wild bull in here... But the lasso missed!
Phoenix:
You sure have an active imagination.
Door
Phoenix:
The evidence room is beyond that door.
Ema:
Let's just walk in! ... It won't open.
Phoenix:
You thought it'd be open? (I think we'd need someone's permission to go in there first...)
Spray luminol
Top of large cactus
Ema:
Wow! We got a reaction!
Phoenix:
Hm. There's clearly blood around the thorns here. This room's pretty messy. Someone must have tripped over something... and planted their head right in these thorns.
Ema:
... I think that might be more painful than being murdered.
Underground Parking Lot
Talk
Today's trial
Angel:
You certainly put me in a tight spot today.
Phoenix:
My apologies, Ms. Starr, but...
Angel:
No, no, it's okay. It was my fault.
Ema:
Oh, we know.
Angel:
I witnessed everything from that security room right there. But... I was afraid that wouldn't sound convincing enough, you see... I was wrong to think that. I'm sorry.
Ema:
Sorry? You lied on the witness stand! That's unforgivable!
Angel:
... Little girl, don't forget what's important here. Even if the place I witnessed the events from was different, I still saw what I saw. I saw Chief Prosecutor Skye stab a man in cold blood, and that testimony still stands!
Ema:
Ah...
Angel:
I swear it on my honor as a detective! She stabbed Goodman!
Ema:
...!
Phoenix:
(I know this photograph has something important to tell us... but what?)
Detective Starr
Ema:
So... you were a detective, weren't you, Ms. Starr?
Angel:
Yes... It was a long time ago. Well, two years ago. No matter how hardened the criminal, when they faced me... They coughed it up.
Phoenix:
Coughed it... up?
Angel:
They confessed. They babbled like babies. You know, I may seem like a demon sometimes... But I can be an angel, too.
Phoenix:
I wouldn't doubt it.
Angel:
Every day, I dragged the dirt out of the mouths of suspect after suspect... And before long, they called me... The Cough-up Queen!
Ema:
Oh, and here I had thought someone had gotten food poisoning from your lunches.
Phoenix:
And... you were "let go"? Er... fired?
Angel:
I felt that I had found my dream job when I became an investigator... And if these prim and proper prosecutors hadn't let me go, I'd still be one today.
Angel:
It's all because of that case... The SL-9 Incident.
Phoenix:
Ess... el..? (Wait! She doesn't mean...!)
SL9 Incident (appears after Detective Starr, presenting Victim's Note or Switchblade Knife, and presenting Crime Photo)
Angel:
That's when I learned the truth. We're nothing to them. Disposable.
Ema:
Disposable?
Angel:
Two years ago... it was the biggest case I'd ever handled. The police and the prosecutors were desperate for decisive evidence.
Ema:
So... they didn't solve it?
Angel:
On the contrary. It was solved quite cleanly. The criminal was caught and executed.
Phoenix:
(E-executed...?)
Angel:
Yes, the criminal got what was coming to him. It doesn't get any cleaner than that. The only problem was... they never did find decisive evidence. Not even a little.
Phoenix:
What!? But the criminal was executed, right?
Angel:
Evidence... of a sort. Made up evidence.
Ema:
Wh-what? You mean they executed someone with fabricated evidence!?
Angel:
... The best part came several months after the trial. Every detective involved with the case was dealt with. Some were demoted to patrolmen, others found themselves out of a job...
Ema:
And... you were one of those?
Angel:
Myself, and one other person you know well.
Phoenix:
(Wait, could it be...?)
Angel:
Exactly. Officer Jake Marshall. He's on security detail in the Police Department, isn't he?
Detective Marshall (appears after SL9 Incident)
Angel:
As professional detectives, we investigated that case from every angle. Jake was particularly determined. And then... it was over. And he was demoted. However... He hasn't forgotten. And neither have I!
Phoenix:
You haven't forgotten SL-9?
Angel:
There was another side to that case, a hidden side. That's what we're after now. And no one up in their fancy offices can stop us.
Ema:
Wait! Th-those lunches you sell...
Angel:
There is only one reason I come to sell lunches in this accursed office. I come here to meet old friends... boyfriends that can help me investigate.
Phoenix:
(Ms. Starr's old boyfriends... How many does she have, anyway?)
Leads to:
"(Just when the detectives on this case have disappeared, we find new evidence...)"
Phoenix:
(Just when the detectives on this case have disappeared, we find new evidence...)
Ema:
There has to be a connection!
Angel:
So, Rookie...
Phoenix:
Wh-what!
Angel:
It seems like you're serious about investigating this case...
Phoenix:
Yes.
Angel:
Then you should take this.
Phoenix:
A... Salisbury Steak Lunch?
Angel:
I know a certain guy who might help you if you tempt him with this treat...
Steak Lunch received from Ms. Starr.
Ema:
Um, Ms. Starr...? Officer Marshall... is he your... uh, are you his...? Are you g-g-g-going out!?
Angel:
Why do you want to know?
Ema:
I was just wondering what happened to him? A long time ago, when he was helping my sister do cases, he was so nice. He got along so well with my sister, it made me jealous. And... he was nice to me too, back then.
Phoenix:
(This would be when Officer Marshall was a detective.)
Ema:
But now... now he's so cold!
Angel:
... Jake and I are merely cooperating on this investigation. We're putting the past to rest, as it were. Nothing more than that.
Ema:
I... I see. Thank you.
Phoenix:
(Officer Jake Marshall... Hmm...)
Present
Steak Lunch
Angel:
You'll give that to Jake like I asked, won't you?
Ema:
Um...! Y-you, and Officer M-Marshall, you... uh... A-a-a-a-are y-you... Are you going out!?
Angel:
... Jake and I are cooperating on an investigation, that's all. We're just putting the past to rest.
Ema:
Thank you.

Steak on Steak Lunch
Ema:
Wow, my mouth is watering! I can almost hear the sound of steak frying on the grill!
Phoenix:
No doubt it's all cold and tough by now.
Ema:
No, I'm sure it's delicious! Ms. Starr poured her heart into making this!
Phoenix:
So long as she didn't put any other organs in there...
Bottom of Steak Lunch
Phoenix:
Let's see... "Ingredients: Meat"
Ema:
She must mean "beef." She probably just wrote it generically.
Phoenix:
Uh... yeah. Let's hope so.
Ema:
Of course, as a scientist I have to check what additives she used.
Phoenix:
Go to town.
Ema:
Huh? It says here... "Hours of sweat and labor."
Phoenix:
So that's why the sauce is so salty...

Gumshoe:
One steak lunch, please! Oh, it's you.
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Now's no time for chit-chat, pal. I'm a busy man! What I really need is a steak lunch from Lunchland.
Ema:
Oh... you mean one of these? Actually, it's not for sale...
Gumshoe:
......
Phoenix:
(I think I just heard the sound of his heart breaking.)
Gumshoe:
Now's no time for despair! We've caught our criminal! Now we just need evidence!
Phoenix:
The criminal... you mean...?
Gumshoe:
You heard about the stabbing in the Police Department evidence room, pal?
Phoenix:
On the same day that a detective was killed in the Prosecutor's parking lot... Another detective... was killed at the Police Department!?
Edgeworth:
And the perpetrator? Do you have a suspect?
Gant:
Well, there was a suspect. Just arrested 'em, in fact.
Gumshoe:
It's the biggest scandal to hit the station in ages! Everything's topsy-turvy.
Phoenix:
But, Detective Gumshoe, who was it?
Gumshoe:
Listen, pal, all I know is I need me a steak lunch, pronto! Standing around here talking isn't going to fill my belly!
Ema:
W-wait! Don't leave!
Gumshoe:
If you want to know more, head on down to the detention center, pal. Questioning should be over, so I figure he's down there having a good cry. Later!
Ema:
He ran off to the evidence room...
Phoenix:
Well, this investigation is off to a running start.
Examine

Phoenix:
Look, that patrolman is saluting the other guy. He must be a detective!
Police:
Answer me! How many fingers do you see!?
Patrolman:
... I-I'm sorry! I don't know!
Police:
Well, that's 20 for the left, but nowhere near that for the right... Get glasses, officer!

Phoenix:
They make a good pair.

Phoenix:
Uh, yeah, I guess they did. (Best to not go too far down that road right now. Things will just get confusing.)
*WHEEEEEEEEEEEEN*
Ema:
Wh-what was that!?
???:
Sir! That's what I'm saying! Me, a perpetrator? I-I-I'd say I-I-I was the perpetrated against, sir! That's what I'd say! Ah, oh, uh. Hi. Greetings, sir!
Ema:
Wait, I know who you are...
Officer:
Excuse me! But is Mr. Edgeworth, uh... anywhere on the premises? I'm here, sir, at the request of the Chief, sir! I've got your report, sir!
Ema:
Officer Meekins! So you're a guard here at the detention center?
Officer:
No, sir! I'm not, sir! I'm a little lost patrolman, like a little lost lamb, sir!
Ema:
Oh, I get it. You're here to deliver a report?
Officer:
No, sir, I, uh, how should I say this...
Phoenix:
(Wait... he isn't... is he?) You... Officer Meekins... You didn't... did you?
Officer:
Err..........
Meekins:
Perpetrator Officer Meekins reporting, sir!!!
Ema:
What...!? Whaaaaaaaaat!?

(Now this is an unexpected turn of events...)
Examine
Surveillance camera
Phoenix:
Smile for the camera... Poor Officer Meekins... I think he knows he's being watched.
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. Seeing a fellow patrolman in here must make him worry about his own fate in life.
Ema:
No comments from the peanut gallery!
Talk
The day of the crime
Meekins:
Sir! I'm a patrolman with General Affairs, sir! SIR!
Phoenix:
Ow. I can hear you fine, Officer Meekins.
Meekins:
I had some business that day, sir, and so I went to the evidence room, sir... The guard office in front of the room was empty, sir!
Ema:
So, normally there's a guard at the evidence room?
Meekins:
That's right, sir! Because evidence is kept in the evidence room, sir! Now, the security officer... was none other than Officer Marshall!
Phoenix:
(M-Marshall!?)
Meekins:
Then, sir, I happened to glance at the security room monitor! That's when I saw him, sir! A suspicious person in the evidence room! A suspicious person, sir! A suspicious person! Yowwowowowowowow!!!
Phoenix:
(What the heck is this guy doing?)
Ema:
So what happened then?
Meekins:
After that, sir, I... I... everything went white! I saw red! I blacked out! And... when I came to, I was here. In the detention center.
Phoenix:
(How long were you out!? Days!?)
Ema:
Um, might I ask... what happened to your hand?
Meekins:
Sir! There was no one to bandage me, sir! So I did what I could to wrap it up, sir!
Phoenix:
(A bandage on his hand... just like Ms. Skye.)
Ema:
Yet another similarity between this case and the one at the Prosecutor's Office...
Phoenix:
First things first... tell us how you hurt your hand!
The victim
Phoenix:
Um, I don't mean to pry, but you are the perpetrator, correct? You killed Detective Bruce Goodman in the evidence room... right?
Meekins:
Sir... Please don't look at me with those sad puppy dog eyes, sir! If you have to label me as persecutor or victim, sir... Then label me victim!
Phoenix:
Um, I would, but you happen to be in detention. And alive and well at that.
Meekins:
Ah, yes, well, that's true, sir. I suppose you could say that.
Phoenix:
Did you know the victim, Detective Goodman?
Meekins:
Well, sir, if I had to label him as a "stranger" or a "total stranger"... Then I'd say he leans heavily on the "total stranger" side!
Phoenix:
So... you didn't know him?
Meekins:
Sir! I work in a tiny department, devoid of light or other creature comforts! I don't know any detectives!
Ema:
So, if he was a total stranger, why did you stab him?
Meekins:
Sir! I had n-no intention of killing him, sir! None! N-nor do I have any recollection of k-killing him, sir!
Phoenix:
(At least someone around here is more confused than I am.)
Crime details (appears after The victim and presenting Goodman's ID)
Phoenix:
Can you tell me what it is you do "remember"?
Meekins:
Well sir, you might say I'm a lost little patrolman. A lost little lamb, if you will! I didn't know Mr. Detective Goodman who was in the evidence room.
Phoenix:
And that's why you thought he looked suspicious...
Meekins:
Sir, I entered the evidence room, and asked the man to display his ID card!
Ema:
Well, that sounds pretty much by the book so far.
Meekins:
Th-that's right, sir! That's what I've been trying to tell you!
Phoenix:
So you asked Detective Goodman to show his ID card. What did he do?
Meekins:
That's the thing! Suddenly he pointed a knife at me!
Ema:
What...!?
Meekins:
Sir, I assure you I was as flustered as you are right now! So I whooped and leapt at him!
Phoenix:
(Detective Goodman pointed a knife at him?)
Meekins:
"Do unto others before they do unto you"! My father's own words, sir!
Ema:
Wh-what happened then?
Meekins:
Well... My eyes, sir... everything went white. When I awoke, I was here.
Phoenix:
(Right...)
Bandaged hand (appears after The day of the crime)
Phoenix:
And your hand... that happened when Detective Goodman was stabbed?
Meekins:
Well! You see, sir, I, er...
Ema:
Don't you think you should just confess?
Meekins:
But, sir! Sir! But! There was nothing I could do!
Phoenix:
"Nothing you could do"...?
Meekins:
Sir, to tell the truth, sir, when it happened... When the detective pointed that knife at me, I just hollered, sir! And the next thing I knew, I was unconscious!
Phoenix:
The next thing you knew you were... huh?
Meekins:
Then, when I opened my eyes... I was alone in the evidence room, sir! All alone! Alone, because... Because Detective Goodman had disappeared!!!
Ema:
What!?
Meekins:
Then when I looked down, I was gushing blood from my hand, sir! Oh, the shock! Oh, the sorrow, sir! Can you imagine how I felt?
Phoenix:
(The victim's body... disappeared...?)
Ema:
Hmm... That's some story.
Reason for arrest (appears after Crime details)
Ema:
So, Officer Meekins, why was it that they arrested you?
Phoenix:
What do you mean, Ema?
Ema:
Let's look at what we know. Now, Officer Meekins didn't know Detective Goodman... And the "victim" whom he met at the scene of the crime didn't show his ID card.
Phoenix:
In other words, we have no way of knowing if the victim was really the victim!
Ema:
And if this "body" just "disappeared" from the evidence room... We don't even know if anyone actually died!
Meekins:
That's it, sir! That! That's what I wanted to say! That is... I did say something along those lines.
Ema:
Huh? But you still ended up here...?
Meekins:
They told me that it had to be him, sir. "On that day, at that time..." Detective Goodman was definitely in the evidence room." That's what they said.
Phoenix:
But... you don't remember the events clearly?
Meekins:
No... but the video tape is quite clear.
Ema:
Huh? Video tape...?
Meekins:
From the security camera. The crime, my crime, the crime I swore to stamp out! It's there! It's me! It's on tape!
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
...
Meekins:
...
Ema:
And you wait until now to tell us this!?
Meekins:
I'm sorry, really sorry, sir! I'll hand over my badge! I don't deserve it!
Phoenix:
N-no thanks, I have my own. (Well, guess we'd better go check out the crime scene.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Officer Meekins, have a look at this.
Meekins:
... Go ahead, sir, laugh! Laugh at me, sir!
Phoenix:
Ha ha... huh?
Meekins:
I know what you want to say! You're going to tell me how she has one just like it!
Ema:
M-me? Why would I...?
Meekins:
I know, sir, I know. I'm the only one without a girl with matching badges! Nowhere! I'm alone! All alone! Is that so wrong!? Life isn't all about high school sweethearts and youthful romance, sir!
Phoenix:
(Is he talking about those badges on her coat?)
Ema:
Hmph.
Phoenix:
(I'd like to think there's a difference between my badge and a fashion accessory...)
Goodman's ID
Ema:
Um... do you think you could take a look at this?
Meekins:
... Hey! That's it, sir! That's it! That's it!!!
Ema:
That's what!?
Meekins:
My head was a blank until this very moment! But, sir, now I remember! I remember, sir!
Phoenix:
You mean you remember what happened?
Meekins:
Correct! That card, that card was the cause of it all!
Ema:
This... ID card?
Meekins:
Exactly, sir! That's exactly it! Nothing could be more exact, sir! Nothing!
Phoenix:
(I'd better pry into this one a little deeper.)
Edgeworth's Knife or Switchblade Knife
Phoenix:
Officer Meekins, this is for you!
Meekins:
Eeeek! I-I'm scared of knives, sir!
Phoenix:
It's okay, I just wanted you to take a look at it.
Meekins:
That's it, sir! Last night, sir! That's the one! I was an apple sir, in my dream, sir, and I was... I was being peeled!
Ema:
On second thought, you don't have to look at the knife.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... He's overreacting to the knife, but I guess he's been through a lot.)
Crime Photo
Meekins:
Hey! Why do you have that? That's...
Phoenix:
From the day... It was taken at the Prosecutor's Office.
Ema:
The day that Detective Goodman's body was found in the trunk...
Meekins:
So this means... This means I'm a free man! Innocent! If this is a dream, sir... Then I hope I never wake up!
Phoenix:
(If this is a dream you'd better wake up right now!)
Anything else
Phoenix:
Officer Meekins, could you take a look at this?
Meekins:
I'm sorry, sir, really sorry, but I have no idea what that is. Maybe you should ask Mr. Edgeworth, sir?
Ema:
He's passing the buck, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
It takes a special kind of man to pass the buck to Edgeworth...

Are you sure this is all, hmm? You know what it means if there is anything missing!
Chief:
Sir! I'm sure it's most likely totally perfect! We checked the drawers, the lockers, the garbage cans, the coat pockets... the pillowcases, behind the computer monitors, the coffee machine...

Detective

That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"I know! The killer used a cassette tape! What a crafty trick! That gunshot was a fake!" This is good! No one will expect a cassette tape in this day and age!

Chief:
Ooh, sorry you had to see that.
Ema:
Uh... what exactly did the Chief of Police want you to do?
Chief:
Well, see over there? That's Goodman's desk. He wanted me to check it for anything that might be a clue... They took away every last piece of garbage in the trash can.
Ema:
So, nothing belonging to Detective Goodman is still here?
Chief:
Of course not! Well, except for this.
Ema:
What!? You kept something!?
Chief:
Sure, why not? It's not important. He didn't even finish writing it! It's a lost item report but it's only half complete.
Ema:
A lost item? Did Detective Goodman lose something?
Phoenix:
The date on it is February 21. (I'll make a note of that just in case.)
Goodman's Lost Item Report added to the Court Record.

(I should probably get a quick look around the crime scene...)

Edgeworth

Um... is Edgeworth going to be okay?
Gant:
Oh, Worthy? Oh, you know, they're doing a little inquiry committee with him.
Ema:
Sounds like an inquisition...!
Gant:
Yep, well, we've had no end of trouble with the boy since last year...
Phoenix:
You mean... the incident on Gourd Lake?
Gant:
It doesn't look good having one of our top people sitting in the defendant's seat. Now, you got someone else found guilty in that case, right, Wrighto?
Phoenix:
(von Karma...)
Gant:
A legend he was, undefeated in his forty year career! But in court you fixed it so he was caught for forging evidence...
Phoenix:
W-wait! I didn't do anything wrong! He did forge evidence.
Gant:
In any case, the Prosecutor's Office is in a bit of turmoil, you might say. Why, they'd do just about anything to restore their reputation. Now, depending on what that inquiry committee decides... It could be bad for Worthy.
Ema:
Wh-what!?
Evident incident
Gant:
It's downright odd, I tell you. I mean, it happened at exactly the same time!
Phoenix:
(The murder at the Prosecutor's Office...)
Ema:
Scientifically speaking, it's impossible!
Gant:
Yes, but that's what the evidence is saying. "Goodman was stabbed in two locations at the same time!" That's what it says.
Phoenix:
What evidence is this...?
Gant:
Now, now, Wrighto, I can't give away all our secrets just like that! And this in particular, well it's a little sensitive... and I can't talk about it.
Phoenix:
(I wasn't expecting much anyway.)
Gant:
You know, one thing I hate most of all is hiding stuff. Secrets. Can't stand 'em! But you know... It's a full time job just keeping the Head Detective's trap shut!
Ema:
Ah, he was the one you were picking on earlier?
Gant:
Huh? You saw that? Whoops!
Phoenix:
(I wonder what it was that he wanted the Head Detective to do?)
Ema:
Let's see if we can kind of discreetly ask him.
Permission granted (appears after Edgeworth and Evident incident, and examining Chief)

Hmm? Well, I never thought the day would come when Wrighto asked me for help!

I was wondering if we could investigate the evidence room?
Gant:
Now, Wrighto...
Phoenix:
A-actually, I'm sorry, I d-don't need to investigate after all!
Gant:
Wrighto, please, do I look like a selfish man?

Huh?
Gant:
Heck, if anyone asked me "sir, can I borrow $50?" I'd give them $50, no problem. So, go ahead! Investigate that room to your heart's content! Knock yourself out!

It just goes to show, you never know until you ask!
Gant:
And for you, here, you can borrow this.

The guy who can't sit still... does he mean Detective Gumshoe?
Phoenix:
Either him or the Dancing Blue Badger.

Cacti
Ema:
This cactus sure is prickly. It must be real.
Marshall:
Best keep your distance from Billy there. You're liable to get hurt.
Phoenix:
Billy... The cactus has a name?
Ema:
Billy, you're wearing your cowboy hat on your hand.
Marshall:
Ah, my rawhide cow skin 10-gallon hat! I just picked that up, but Billy took a fancy to it.
Phoenix:
(Looks like it got stuck on the thorns and he couldn't get it off.)
Monitors
Ema:
You sure have a lot of monitors in here!
Marshall:
There's eight cameras in the evidence room in all. One for each section.
Ema:
Which monitor shows the section where the crime took place?
Marshall:
Why do cattle sit before the rains come? It's not for man to know.
Ema:
Unless you're the security guard responsible!
Swinging door
Ema:
Look at this swinging door! Just like a wild west saloon!
Marshall:
Ah... Sorry, pardner, but we're closed for the day.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Marshall:
Y'all get along home now!
Ema:
I think Officer Marshall really wanted to be a wild west bartender.
Marshall:
I always wanted to say that.
Lasso
Ema:
Look, on the floor, it's a lasso.
Phoenix:
Hmm... looks like it's set up to trap something.
Marshall:
I just roped me a steer with this here lasso.
Ema:
What!?
Marshall:
It was a' bellowing "moo, pal! moo!"
Phoenix:

Talk
Any option (before presenting Steak Lunch)
Ema:
Um, I was wondering if we could talk to you...
Marshall:
Sorry, bambina. But I'm off to roam the lands, like a tumbleweed on the wide prairie. Like a gunslinger loading his six-shooter, I say a little prayer. GRROOOOORRK
Ema:
What was that all about, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I think he was just too hungry to talk.
Ema:
You're just saying that because his stomach was growling! You have no idea what he was talking about either!
Phoenix:
(Well, in any case, we need to get cracking on this investigation, pronto!)
Guard office (after presenting Steak Lunch)
Ema:
Officer Marshall, you're in charge of security for the evidence room, right?
Marshall:
You got good eyes, pardner. It's an easy job, and I'm grateful for it.
Phoenix:
Actually, Officer Meekins at the detention center told us.
Marshall:
Ah, that poor little dogie? Poor guy, I keep getting his name wrong and calling him "Meekly."
Phoenix:
He told us something. He said that, when the stabbing occurred... you weren't at your station.
Marshall:
... Well, maybe I shouldn't be telling you this... But since I got demoted from detective two years ago... Well, it might not look it, but I lost my fire for the job, you know?
Ema:
So... what were you doing around 5:15 when the murder took place?
Marshall:
Well... I reckon I was galloping down the highway on the back of my steed, Zippy.
Ema:
Note: he was riding down the highway on his horse named "Zippy."
Marshall:
There's no need for people here, anyhow. These newfangled machines do a bang-up job of keeping an eye on the place.
Phoenix:
You mean the security camera system?
Marshall:
I don't take to machines much. Kinda like that stewed broccoli they sneak in next to your steak, you know?
Marshall (after presenting Steak Lunch)
Ema:
Ms. Starr told us something... She said that you were a detective until two years ago.
Marshall:
It was always my dream to be a rawhide wrangler on the scene of the crime... That's all gone now... Like a drinking hole in a prairie fire.
Ema:
You're still investigating the SL-9 Incident with Ms. Starr, aren't you?
Marshall:
That was my case... It's all "solved" on the record books. But it smells like a bad game of poker. I can't let it go... That's all there is to it.
Ema:
What kind of case was it, anyway? We've heard the name so many times, but no one tells us what actually happened.
Marshall:
... There are some things you're better off not knowing, Bambina. Anyway, that case is officially dead as of two days ago.
Phoenix:
Two days ago... the day of our case!
Marshall:
That's right... The evidence transferals.
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth was talking about the transferals, too.)
Security system (appears after Guard office)
Marshall:
I know what maybe two of the machines in here do.
Ema:
O-only two of them? There must be a dozen!
Marshall:
Like I said, bambina, Me and machines, well... I like them about as much as I like stewed cauliflower with my steaks. The easiest ones to understand are these here security cameras.
Phoenix:
(Those are the ones that Officer Meekins mentioned.)
Marshall:
If nothing happens, the tapes are automatically erased every few hours.
Ema:
And Officer Meekins and Detective Goodman, are they on one of those tapes?
Marshall:
I reckon they might be.
Phoenix:
(You're the security guard and you "reckon"!?)
Marshall:
One more thing. When you go into the evidence room... You need an ID card.
Phoenix:
(Thus the card reader by the door.)
Marshall:
The card reader leaves a record of every ID card passed through.
Phoenix:
(So this is the ID card record...)
Ema:
Hey! I've seen that somewhere before!
Marshall:
Sorry, Bambina. I can't show you more than that.
Ema:
Huh?
Marshall:
I haven't heard whether this is related to the case, yet.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! I saw a number on that record just now! I've seen that number before!
Phoenix:
(Maybe there's some way I can prove that record is tied to the stabbing.)
Transferal (appears after Marshall)
Phoenix:
Sorry, but could you explain what this whole "transferal" thing is about?
Marshall:
We keep only evidence from solved cases in this room. They're kept here under the presiding detective's supervision for two years. So we can re-investigate them if it turns out there was a mistake, see?
Phoenix:
So, what happens to the evidence after two years?
Marshall:
It goes to sleep forever in the underground vault at the Police Station. That's what we call "transferal." We do it every February.
Ema:
I see now...
Marshall:
"Transferal" is like a funeral for old cases. Two years after a case is solved... it's closed forever. Dead. Never to be reopened again. Never to be reinvestigated.
Phoenix:
(And that happened to SL-9 two days ago...)
Present
Goodman's ID (after Security system)
Ema:
See this? This is the victim's ID card.
Marshall:
Ah, the one that was on the ground in the parking lot?
Phoenix:
The number on this is... "5842189."
Ema:
Officer Marshall! Show us the ID number on that ID card record! Look, the fourth number! It's a perfect match!
Phoenix:
It was used at... 5:14. Right before the stabbing!
Marshall:
What's more, there's only one of them cards in the world!
Ema:
So, when the incident occurred, Detective Goodman was in the evidence room!
Phoenix:
(But wait, what did Officer Meekins say?)
Meekins:
Sir, I entered the evidence room, and asked the man to display his ID card!
Phoenix:
So you asked Detective Goodman to show his ID card. What did he do?
Meekins:
That's the thing! Suddenly he pointed a knife at me!
Phoenix:
(If he had his ID card then... Why would he have pointed a knife at Officer Meekins?)
Marshall:
Alright, compadre, you win. I guess I can give you this ID card record.
ID Card Record added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I've got an idea... Maybe I should show this list to other people with IDs here...)
Steak Lunch
Marshall:
......... That smell... Ah! Reminds me of Texas!
Ema:
So, Officer Marshall... You're from Texas?
Marshall:
No, I just saw a special on television the other day. Is this from my baby?
Ema:
Uh, yeah, Ms. Starr...
Marshall:
Wh-what's this!?
Ema:
What? What's wrong?
Marshall:
A filet steak lunch! I see... I see!
Ema:
I don't see. I wonder what it means?
Steak Lunch given to Officer Marshall.
Marshall:
Alright, bambina. You win. Ask mmph mmph munch munch Anything mmph munch snack.
Phoenix:
(Finally, it seems like...)
Ema:
He's willing to talk!
Anything else
Marshall:
The sheriffs back in the wild west didn't place much faith in evidence. About the only thing they trusted was their shooting hand.
Ema:
Um... this is neither "Wild" nor "West" here...
Marshall:
Ah hah! But that and this are two different things entirely!
Ema:
... I... guess so? Huh? I'm lost.
Phoenix:
(Looks like we need some evidence to get anywhere with this guy.)

Evidence Room
Leads to:
February 23
Evidence Room
Sector Three
February 23Evidence RoomSector Three
Phoenix:
(It's quiet... the investigation must be over here.)
Ema:
So this is the evidence room? It really is kind of like a graveyard.
Phoenix:
Graveyards are supposed to have grass and trees. This feels more like a morgue.
Ema:
N-nice try, M-Mr. Wright. Y-you can't scare me! Eeeeeeek!
Gumshoe:
Whoooooah!
Ema:
S-sorry, I thought you were a ghost!
Gumshoe:
I wouldn't recommend going around smacking ghosts on the head, pal. So, is it true what I heard?
Gant:
Wrighto, please, do I look like a selfish man? Heck, if anyone asked me "sir, can I borrow $50?" I'd give them $50, no problem. So, go ahead! Investigate that room to your heart's desire! Knock yourself out!
Phoenix:
Yeah, it's true.
Gumshoe:
So, Chief of Police Gant... will loan anyone 50 bucks? Even me!?
Ema:
Oh, so that's what you were talking about...
Gumshoe:
Actually, I was put in charge of the investigation for today.
Phoenix:
Just for today?
Ema:
Boss for a day...
Gumshoe:
But guess what!? You got permission from the Chief... So now you're boss for a day!
Phoenix:
(Gee, thanks...)
Gumshoe:
First of all, you'll want to have this.
Evidence Room Floor Plans added to the Court Record.
Examine (left side)
Door
Ema:
That's the door we just came in through.
Phoenix:
Looks like you don't need an ID card to get out.
Ema:
I wonder what would happen if Officer Marshall cut the power while we were inside?
Phoenix:
... (Let's hope he remembers we're in here.)
Junk near door
Ema:
Wow! Look at this big pile of junk in the corner!
Phoenix:
That looks like... a car door.
Ema:
There's a pair of handcuffs attached to the frame.
Phoenix:
Maybe the guy they caught was some sort of escape artist and he got away.
Ema:
Hey, that's one of those human profiles for range testing.
Phoenix:
He's been shot square in the forehead.
Ema:
Better him than us.
Locker with white cloth
Phoenix:
There's something sticking out of here.
Ema:
Looks like a shirt. I guess it must be evidence for some case.
Phoenix:
I wonder if Detective Gumshoe put this here.
Gumshoe:
There you go, pal, making me out to be some kinda slob! I'm not responsible for the evidence here. That said... I bet that evidence locker was opened recently.
Ema:
How do you know?
Gumshoe:
If you leave things hanging out like that, the evidence gets dirty or ripped. The guard checks on that kind of stuff and notifies the detective responsible. How many times have I had him breathing down my neck about some silly evidence...
Ema:
Sounds like Detective Gumshoe leaves evidence hanging out a lot, too.
Phoenix:
I bet he doesn't tuck in his shirt under that trench coat, either.
Gumshoe:
If you're going to talk behind someone's back, don't do it right in front of them, pal!
Closed lockers
Ema:
This place is stuffed with evidence... stuffed with dreams.
Phoenix:
I'm not so sure about the dreams.
Ema:
Mmph! It won't open.
Phoenix:
I guess I should have known.
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal, our security is high-tech around here!
Junk between lockers
Phoenix:
Some sort of bulky equipment is gathering dust here.
Ema:
What a sorry looking fishing pole that is.
Gumshoe:
Ah! That's my personal pole! I never did get around to using it...
Phoenix:
Wait, I've seen that somewhere before...
Gumshoe:
Right, pal. That's that metal detector! The one that led to the solving of that case out on Gourd Lake, remember?
Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wow, that feels like it was ages ago. And... hmm, I don't think I've seen this one before.
Gumshoe:
Oh, that! That's a radiolocator! I'm sure it will come in handy in solving some case sooner or later.
Phoenix:
(That cheap-looking box?)
Gumshoe:
You can't judge a person or a machine by their cover! You gotta look at their heart!
Examine (right side)
Locker with bloody handprint
Phoenix:
Wh-what's this...!? Blood!
Ema:
It's a little worn... but there's definitely a handprint here!
Phoenix:
It looks like someone tried to wipe it off.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! What if there are other bloodstains left in the room!?
Phoenix:
(We should use her testing fluid to check it out.)
Clay shards
Ema:
Wow, someone must have broken something big to make all these pieces.
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, perhaps?
Gumshoe:
There you go, pal, making me out to be some kind of hooligan! That's apparently from "the" case.
Ema:
"The" case?
Gumshoe:
The SL-9 Incident, pal. See the sticker on one of the pieces there?
Phoenix:
(Another piece of SL-9 evidence...)
Check it out closer.
Leads to:
"I wonder what shape these pieces were in before whatever it was broke?"
Look for other evidence.
Phoenix:
(Let's not waste too much time with this now.)
Ema:
We can check it out later.
Phoenix:
I wonder what shape these pieces were in before whatever it was broke?
Ema:
You want to try to put it back together?
Gumshoe:
Hah! Good luck, pal. That's no job for amateurs. Why, I spent a good three hours on that before I had to give up!
Ema:
That's why I always carry around a tube of glue!
Phoenix:
(Well, this piece looks like the bottom. Let's try putting the rest in place!)
Combine available pieces
Leads to:
"H-huh?"
Back
Phoenix:
It's no use. These pieces just don't add up to anything!
Ema:
Maybe some of the pieces are missing? Let's just try to put as many of the pieces in place as we can!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe I'll give it another shot later.)
Ema:
H-huh? Well, I think we did it. But some of the pieces are missing.
Gumshoe:
That only took me two minutes to do! The problem is finishing it!
Ema:
Were some pieces stolen?
Phoenix:
I bet they were missing to begin with.
Gumshoe:
Still... It doesn't look like the most stable kind of jar.
Ema:
I kind of understand how it got broken.
Unstable Jar added to the Courtroom Record.
Clay shards (after assembling Unstable Jar)
Phoenix:
If you put these pieces together, it makes a jar.
Ema:
There are two things that bother me. One: why are some of the pieces missing? Two: doesn't it seem a little unstable!? No wonder it broke!
Phoenix:
I'll make sure to remember that next time I make a jar.
Open locker
Ema:
Look, this one's open! And there's a indicator tag stuck on it still!
Gumshoe:
That locker is coded with Detective Goodman's fingerprint.
Phoenix:
(Detective Goodman's locker!)
Ema:
Are you sure it's okay to leave it open like that?
Gumshoe:
Well, it'd be hard to get it open again if we closed it.
Phoenix:
(It's empty... they must have taken the contents elsewhere.)
Rubber glove
Ema:
Someone left a glove here... but only one.
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, maybe?
Gumshoe:
There you go, pal, making me out to be some kind of absent-minded detective! That's evidence from "the" case, you know.
Phoenix:
You mean SL-9? (It does have a tag on it...)
Rubber Glove added to the Court Record.
Saw and paint cans
Ema:
What is a saw and paint doing here?
Gumshoe:
Since the dawn of time... True art has always been a war against oppression.
Ema:
True art...? I noticed that there's blue and yellow paint here.
Phoenix:
Perhaps we're witnessing the birthplace of the Blue Badger?
Gumshoe:
Well... You might say this is my studio...
Phoenix:
(Here? In the evidence room!?)
Talk
Boss for a day
Ema:
So, Detective Gumshoe, you're boss for the day?
Gumshoe:
That's right! It's an honor! After all, the murder took place right here, in the Police Department!
Ema:
But, if you're boss... why are you all alone!? Where are your underlings?
Gumshoe:
... They're using our findings from yesterday's investigation to prepare for the trial.
Phoenix:
(In other words, Detective Gumshoe got kicked out of the investigation again...)
Gumshoe:
I'm adamant, though! I'm going to take control and put this case to rest! And in my own evidence locker, pal!
Phoenix:
You have a locker in here, too, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Hah hah, of course! I am a detective, after all. They gave me a locker that only I can open, pal!
Ema:
"Only you can open"...?
Edgeworth
Gumshoe:
I'll always believe in Mr. Edgeworth, no matter what happens.
Ema:
So... Mr. Edgeworth is with the inquiry committee now, right?
Gumshoe:
They're trying to figure out who's responsible for the mess-up in court today.
Phoenix:
I see...
Gumshoe:
I guess this is what you call "fate." Mr. Edgeworth just can't get away from that case...
Phoenix:
That case...?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, that case! The SL-9 Incident, of course! That was the beginning of the end for Mr. Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
(Maybe we can get him to tell us more about the case...)
Evidence safe (appears after Boss for a day)
Gumshoe:
This place is more high-tech than you might think. Every locker is fixed so that only one detective can open it.
Phoenix:
Using this ID card?
Gumshoe:
Well, that's the thing, pal. ID cards can be lost. Why, I'm on my third card since entering the force already.
Ema:
That sounds like a lot.
Gumshoe:
Yes, but even I can't lose my own right hand!
Ema:
"Right hand"...? Oh! You mean, your fingerprint?
Gumshoe:
Exactly, pal! The lock for each locker is coded with a fingerprint! And that's the only locker we can open.
Ema:
Funny, they look like normal lockers...
Gumshoe:
These are the latest model! There's a trick to the handles, see?
Ema:
The handles?
Gumshoe:
On the other side of the handles is a sensor, and if the wrong person touches it...
Ema:
Bzzzap! You get a shock!
Gumshoe:
If that's what happened, my hand would be black and smoking every day! In any case, the locks aren't that obvious. There's even some people in the force that don't know about the fingerprint locks!
Evidence Locker added to the Court Record.
SL9 Incident (appears after presenting Victim's note or Switchblade Knife)
Gumshoe:
Now that was a bloody, violent case.
Phoenix:
Violent... so it was a murder?
Gumshoe:
A serial killing!
Phoenix:
(A serial killing... Maybe I don't want to get involved in this after all.)
Gumshoe:
But the killer made a mistake, and Mr. Edgeworth built his case around that to nab him.
Ema:
And this was two years ago?
Gumshoe:
That put Mr. Edgeworth right in the spotlight... and started the rumor mill.
Phoenix:
Rumors... (About forged evidence?)
Gumshoe:
It was supposed to be all cleaned up with the "transferal" the other day. It was the last job he ever did... Detective Goodman, that is.
Ema:
Huh? What do you mean?
Gumshoe:
Detective Goodman was the detective in charge of the SL-9 Incident, see.
Ema:
So, so... That switchblade knife...
Phoenix:
The victim took the knife out of the evidence locker himself?
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Detective... here's my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
You show this to me every time we meet, pal. Real men show their police badge. 'Nuff said!
Ema:
I wish had a badge... Even an ID card would be nice...
Goodman's ID
Gumshoe:
That's the victim, Detective Goodman's ID card. These days, everything's cards and secret numbers. I can never relax!
Phoenix:
That's only because you always lose your card.
Gumshoe:
I always forget my secret number, too. Scary, huh? My face should be ID enough! What's the world coming to!?
Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe, rebel against the system.)
Prosecutor Trophy
Gumshoe:
Hey, that's it! That's the "King of Prosecutors" award that Mr. Edgeworth got recently!
Phoenix:
Were you at the awards ceremony, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Of course, pal! I got an award for diligence, myself.
Phoenix:
Ah... congratulations.
Ema:
I was wondering, why is the award a shield? And... why is it broken?
Gumshoe:
Oh, there's a reason. Erm... I'll tell you what it is later.
Phoenix:
(Apparently, he's forgotten.)
Edgeworth's Knife or Parking Stub
Gumshoe:
Found in Mr. Edgeworth's car, stabbed with Mr. Edgeworth's knife, huh... What would drive Chief Prosecutor Skye to do such a thing?
Ema:
...
Gumshoe:
W-wait, I didn't mean... I mean, sure, of course someone else really did it! Someone who must have, um... Someone who must have a grudge against Mr. Edgeworth!
Blue Badger Panel
Gumshoe:
This is my crowning achievement, my masterpiece, you might say. But... art is always misunderstood, pal.
Ema:
Art...?
Gumshoe:
He was dancing proudly on the day of the awards ceremony... But there were a lot of people coming and going after the ceremony... So they took the Blue Badger away for a while!
Phoenix:
Really? Why?
Gumshoe:
Oh, they said it was "shameful" or something like that. "Shameful"! I toiled night and day...
Phoenix:
(I sympathize with Detective Gumshoe... but I can see why they moved it.)
Victim's Note or Switchblade Knife
Gumshoe:
Detective Goodman's note... and that switchblade knife. I bet Edgeworth was the most surprised of anyone.
Phoenix:
Because of the SL-9 connection?
Gumshoe:
That was Mr. Edgeworth's first big case you know, two years ago. That was the first time the world knew Edgeworth was a man to be feared!
Phoenix:
But, why would evidence from that case turn up now?
Gumshoe:
I guess it's not over, pal. Maybe there are some loose ends left on that case...
Crime Photo
Gumshoe:
That's the photo that Ms. Starr took.
Phoenix:
Anything you can tell us about it?
Gumshoe:
That Ms. Starr is quite the lady. Why, I remember it was winter... I was 16. She was the only one who ever got me to talk about what happened.
Ema:
16... that's how old I am now! I wonder what happened?
Phoenix:
(I wonder if Detective Gumshoe wore a trench coat in high school, too.)
ID Card Record
Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this? This is the ID card of the person who came here on the day of the stabbing.
Gumshoe:
Ah, I heard the rumors. So it was Goodman who came in here at the time of the murder... Whoooooooooah!!!
Ema:
Wh-what is it?
Gumshoe:
Th-th-th-th-th-th! That second number...
Phoenix:
It's not your ID number is it, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Ema:
What...?
Gumshoe:
The second number on this list... belongs to Mr. Edgeworth!
Ema:
What... Whaaaaaaaaat!?
ID Card Record updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Why would Edgeworth have come to the evidence room!?)
Evidence Locker
Gumshoe:
You can't open the lockers if your fingerprint doesn't match. If you can open it... they'll give you 50 cents!
Ema:
Note: the Police Department lacks faith in its lock system.
Gumshoe:
After all, Detective Goodman was stabbed here after opening his locker... But at the same time he was found dead over at the Prosecutor's Office!
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Allow me to say one thing, speaking as a detective. If I see a piece of evidence I know nothing about, I say nothing! Nothing!
Phoenix:
That's... fine.
Gumshoe:
You bet it's fine, pal!
Spray luminol
Locker with white cloth
Ema:
...! Why am I getting a reaction here?
Phoenix:
There's no reason for the murderer to touch this spot if he fled out the door. (This just might be something significant!)
Gumshoe:
Hey... That's some pretty amazing stuff you got there, pal!
Ema:
What, this? It's called "Luminol Testing Fluid"!
Gumshoe:
Where'd you get your hands on that!?
Ema:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
I'd like to get some too! I'll just borrow 50 bucks from the Chief!
Phoenix:
Where do you get this, Ema?
Ema:
I always buy it by mail order.
Phoenix:
(Well, I'd better jot this down on the floor plans.)
Locker with bloody handprint
Ema:
I knew it! This is someone's right handprint!
Gumshoe:
WHAAAAAAT!!?
Phoenix:
What's the matter, Detective? Th-this locker... It's mine!
Ema:
It's yours?
Gumshoe:
Please! You have to help me... When they come to take me away... Promise you'll testify that I wouldn't harm a fly! You'll do that for me, won't you, pals!?
Phoenix:
(This is an important clue! I'll jot it down on the floor plans...)
Gumshoe:
I'm counting on you guys! Believe me, you can't trust the police!
Ema:
What? But you're a detective!
Crime scene floor
Phoenix:
There must have been a massive amount of blood here. (I've never seen so much before...) I'm not a professional. What's your opinion, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Hmm... Pale blue blood... Maybe Detective Goodman... was actually an alien?
Ema:
This proves that something really happened in front of this locker.
Phoenix:
I'll make a note of it on the floor plans.
Gumshoe:
Hey! If you didn't want my opinion, you shouldn't have asked!
Examine evidence
Tag on Rubber Glove
Phoenix:
The tag says, "SL-9 11." I guess this is another piece of evidence from that case.
Ema:
You know, I never did care for the word, "tag." It's confusing.
Phoenix:
Huh? What's so confusing about that?
Ema:
Do you know how many other words sound like it? "Bag," "Gag," "Nag," "Lag," "Xag"...
Phoenix:
"Xag"...? Is that a word?
Ema:
Do you challenge me...?
Phoenix:
What, are we playing a word game now?
Bloodstain on Unstable Jar
Ema:
Hey, look here! It's hard to make out, but there's a dark red stain here.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Looks like blood.
Ema:
Do you think Detective Goodman's blood somehow got on it when he was stabbed?
Phoenix:
Not likely. This blood looks like it's been here for months, maybe longer. (This jar was evidence in the SL-9 Incident... That might be when the blood got on it.)
Bottom of Unstable Jar
Ema:
Huh? This thing doesn't have a bottom!
Phoenix:
That's weird.
Ema:
I wonder which side is "up"?
Phoenix:
Better yet... What's the purpose of a bottomless jar?
Ema:
... At least it doesn't collect dust inside, right?
(Examining rubber glove, assembling Unstable Jar, clearing all "Talk options", presenting ID Card Record, and spraying luminol on all three areas leads to:)
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal, look at the time!!
Phoenix:
Was there something you needed to be going to?
Gumshoe:
It's just that Mr. Edgeworth's inquiry committee should be letting out soon. I'm going to go give them my report for the day. It might help, you know...
Ema:
R-report? You mean the note written on the back of that flyer?
Phoenix:
The one that says nothing but "No problems"!?
Gumshoe:
Hey, it's Mr. Edgeworth we're talking about! I'm sure he can use a report like this. I believe in him!
Phoenix:
(Who needs enemies when you've got friends like Detective Gumshoe..)
Gumshoe:
I'm off, pal! Later!
Phoenix:
(I should probably see what Edgeworth has to say, too.)
Examine (left side)
Locker with white cloth
Phoenix:
A piece of white cloth is sticking out... looks like a shirt.
Ema:
You'd better tidy it up or it will get wrinkled!
Phoenix:
Hey, don't look at me! I didn't leave it hanging out like that!
Closed lockers
Ema:
This place is stuffed with evidence... stuffed with dreams.
Phoenix:
I'm not so sure about the dreams.
Ema:
Mmph! It won't open.
Phoenix:
I guess I should have known.
Junk between lockers
Ema:
A pile of junk lies battered, worn and forsaken!
Phoenix:
Aren't you being a little dramatic? Looks like a fishing pole... and a metal detector. Not sure what this one is.
Ema:
They cast a withering gaze in our direction that screams, "dust me!"
Phoenix:
Can't junk just be plain old junk?
Examine (right side)
Open locker
Ema:
Detective Goodman's evidence locker. It's empty.
Phoenix:
Only Detective Goodman himself can open this locker.
Ema:
So, the person who took out this knife had to have been Detective Goodman.
Phoenix:
(And why was it wrapped in the "scarf" muffler stuck inside the "car" muffler?)
Rubber glove
Ema:
That yellow crime scene tape! You know, yesterday was my first time seeing that! It was always my dream to push through the crowd and just step over the tape! It's a little daunting to encounter it again so soon!
Phoenix:
(I think maybe you're overreacting a little...)
Saw and paint cans
Ema:
There's blue and yellow paint here. This is all I'd need to paint a portrait of you, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
I am wearing a red necktie, you know...

Bellboy:
Ah, guests! My apologies.
Phoenix:
Oh! It's you!
Bellboy:
Have we met somewhere...?
Phoenix:
Huh!?
Bellboy:
Mr. Edgeworth! I beg your leave. So long!
Phoenix:
(Is Edgeworth here...?)
Ema:
There, standing by the window, a teacup in his hand!
Edgeworth:
Ah, it's you.
Phoenix:
(He has the hotel bring him tea service!?)
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth... you're back from the District Prosecutor's Office inquiry?
Edgeworth:
Precisely.
Phoenix:
By the way, Detective Gumshoe was looking for you.
Edgeworth:
Oh yes... He brought me some information, it seems.
Ema:
Really? Was it helpful?
Edgeworth:
Apparently, a new French restaurant is opening near here. I think he was trying to console me, somehow.
Phoenix:
(Er, I think the report is on the other side, Edgeworth...)
Ema:
Poor Mr. Edgeworth... I think this whole thing is really taking a toll on him.
Talk
Inquiry committee
Phoenix:
So, how did the inquiry committee go?
Edgeworth:
Actually, they decided to treat this not as a case of concealing evidence... But as a communications error during the investigation.
Ema:
"Concealing evidence"...?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Apparently, there are some who believe... that I concealed evidence. They gave me a warning. "You were lucky this time... again."
Phoenix:
"Again"...?
Edgeworth:
I've heard them say that so many times. Ever since that case two years ago...
Tomorrow's trial
Phoenix:
Are you okay for the trial tomorrow?
Edgeworth:
Well, I'm still the presiding prosecuting attorney. However...
Phoenix:
Something happened?
Edgeworth:
They gave control of the investigation over to the Police Department.
Ema:
The Police Department!
Edgeworth:
Yes. Any further investigation for this case will be directed by the Chief of Police Gant. I can do nothing but wait for his results...
Phoenix:
I... see.
Edgeworth:
Why, I ask you? Why!? All along, I've done only what I believe is right. I have nothing to be ashamed of! But still...
Phoenix:
(Wow, I've never seen him this out of sorts...)
Allegations of forgery (appears after presenting Victim's Note or Switchblade Knife)
Edgeworth:
The SL-9 Incident was a heinous serial killing case. The head of investigation was the Deputy Chief of Police at the time... Damon Gant.
Phoenix:
(That wacky old coot was involved in the case two years ago too then...)
Edgeworth:
He was the best we had, and it was my first time working with him... I was nervous.
Ema:
Wow, you get nervous, too, Mr. Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
(What I want to know is why was a Deputy Chief of Police on the investigation?)
Edgeworth:
In truth, I used slightly more... extreme methods than normal. We were dealing with a vicious murderer. If I let him go, the blood would be on my hands. We won our guilty verdict, and the killer was executed.
Phoenix:
Wait, you didn't...
Edgeworth:
Of course not! I didn't touch the evidence. Yes, I will do anything in my power to win a trial. However... I do have a code, and I follow it faithfully.
Present
Victim's Note or Switchblade Knife
Edgeworth:
... I know you. You've probably got a hold of some information already, right?
Phoenix:
It all has to do with that case you were on... the SL-9 Incident. And some "dark suspicion" you were wrapped up in.
Edgeworth:
You are the man who revived the worst memory of my life, as I recall. I figured I'd be telling you about this sooner or later.
Phoenix:
(A bad memory... he's talking about the murder in the elevator...) Okay, Edgeworth. Why don't you tell me about it. Tell me the truth.
ID Card Record
Phoenix:
Oh, right! I'd better check this now...
Edgeworth:
As I was saying, I...&#160;! What's this? A record of ID card usage?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth, you went into the evidence room that day, didn't you? Just before the incident occurred, no less.
Edgeworth:
Yes, that's true.
Ema:
W-why, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Please don't look at me like that. I was asked to go. By Chief Gant no less.
Ema:
The Chief of Police...?
Edgeworth:
He wanted evidence for a case that wrapped up half a year ago. He told me he wanted me to keep it here in the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
But... it was solved, right? It would have to be if the evidence was already filed...
Edgeworth:
The Chief is never one to explain himself. In any case, on the day of the stabbings, I brought this back here.
Ema:
Can I ask what kind of case it was?
Edgeworth:
I... can't say. It really has nothing to do with the current case.
Phoenix:
(Now I'm curious about this other case. I'd better make a note of it.)
Unrelated evidence: Screwdriver added to the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
Stubborn as always. I told you this has nothing to do with the current case.
Anything else
Edgeworth:
... Wright, please. I'm the prosecutor on this case! You don't expect me to sit here and discuss the case with you over a cup of tea!?
Phoenix:
I'll pass on the tea. Just tell me about the case...
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Mr. Edgeworth just told you "no" in a very polite manner!
Phoenix:
(Whose side are you on, anyway? Maybe if I just show him my best evidence I can get some reaction out of him.)
Examine evidence
Tag on Screwdriver
Phoenix:
The tag says, "AI-16."
Ema:
What's that got to do with anything?
Phoenix:
Nothing, apparently. At least, that's what Edgeworth said.
Ema:
Hm. That makes it seem all the more suspicious. Who knows? This might turn out to be the clue that breaks the case!
Phoenix:
Wouldn't that be nice...
(Clearing all "Talk" options and presenting ID Card Record leads to:)
Edgeworth:
By the way, Ema. The Chief Prosecutor wanted to know something...
Ema:
M-my sister? What?
Edgeworth:
You still working on that scientific investigation?
Ema:
Huh? Y-yes! Of course! Why, just today Mr. Wright and I were using this...
Edgeworth:
Luminol testing fluid... Hm? Well then... You might have use for this.
Ema:
Aluminum powder for taking fingerprints!
Edgeworth:
It's been chemically treated for better adhesion.
Ema:
F-for me? Are you sure? We are the "enemy" you know.
Edgeworth:
I've no say in today's investigation... do as you will.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth... I'm really--
Edgeworth:
No need to thank me. Here, take your powder and these fingerprint files for everyone involved.
Phoenix:
I, uh, th-thanks! (How about giving these to Detective Gumshoe as well!?)
Fingerprinting Set and fingerprint file received.
Ema:
Well, let's get going! One last investigation!
Phoenix:
Right! (I do seem to remember seeing a suspicious handprint somewhere...)
Security Guard Office
Move
Evidence Room
Leads to:
February 23
Evidence Room
Sector Three
February 23Evidence RoomSector Three
Phoenix:
(Our investigation turned up a suspicious handprint.)
Ema:
Here, in this blood on the detective's evidence locker.
Phoenix:
Let's use the secret weapon we just borrowed!
Ema:
Right. Let's get started! First... choose a finger.
Phoenix:
A finger...?
Ema:
Each finger leaves behind a slightly different imprint. So let's choose the finger that will have left behind the clearest print!
Phoenix:
I really can't tell the difference at a glance...
Ema:
Quit procrastinating and choose a finger!
Any bloody finger
Leads to:
"Okay. Now it's time to check for prints!"
Ema:
Okay. Now it's time to check for prints! Let me show you how it's done.
Phoenix:
(Ema's starting to get that sparkle in her eyes...)
Ema:
First, we sprinkle the aluminum powder around.
Phoenix:
Huh? How do you do that?
Ema:
Just touch the screen... See?
Phoenix:
Ah... it looks like that did the trick.
Ema:
The aluminum powder adheres completely to the print. Once the powder is well spread... just blow away the excess.
Phoenix:
Huh? How do I do that?
Ema:
You just blow With your breath. Imagine you're blowing out the candles on a birthday cake. See?
Phoenix:
Wow... that looks like fun! (It might take some getting used to though...)
Ema:
It's fine! It won't go up your nose or anything. You just pour the powder on thick, and blow away the extra! Those are the basics of fingerprinting, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(I guess I'd better give it a try...)
Obtain flat print
Leads to:
"Aha! You did it! You found one!"
Ema:
Aha! You did it! You found one!
Phoenix:
But... this looks nothing like a fingerprint.
Ema:
Hmm... now that you mention it, I guess it doesn't...
Phoenix:
What does it mean?
Ema:
It think it means... we're out of luck.
Phoenix:
Out of luck...?
Ema:
The person who left this handprint must have worn gloves.
Phoenix:
... Don't tell me we've been wasting out time here!
Ema:
Hey, calm down. That's just the way it goes sometimes with scientific investigations. But... it does seem a shame. While we're at it, why don't we look for other prints?
Phoenix:
Other prints...?
Ema:
Looking at the locker door again closely...
Ema:
it seems like there are fingerprints outside the bloody handprint as well. Let's see if we can find a clear print!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... fingerprints outside the blood...)
Top non-bloody finger
Obtain fingerprint
Leads to:
"Yay! A print so clear it's dazzling!"
Ema:
Yay! A print so clear it's dazzling!
Phoenix:
D-dazzling...?
Ema:
Anyway, this print took a lot of effort to find. Let's match it up right away!
Phoenix:
So we're not over yet? This is quite a process...
Ema:
Well, there's no point in finding a fingerprint... and not knowing who the owner is, right?
Phoenix:
(I guess she's right...)
Ema:
Look at the fingerprint data we got from Mr. Edgeworth... and point out the person you think left these prints!
Phoenix:
Huh? How am I supposed to know who it was?
Ema:
I could make a pretty good guess. The bloody handprint and the fingerprints are in different places right? That means that the prints probably don't have anything to do with our case. So, whose fingerprints would we most likely find on this evidence locker?
Compare Dick Gumshoe profile
Comparing...Comparison complete.
Match found.
Leads to:
"Ah hah!"
Compare anyone else
Comparing...Comparison complete.
No matches found.
Ema:
Hmm... no match.
Phoenix:
C'mon! How am I supposed to guess whose they are?
Ema:
Isn't it obvious? The bloody handprint and the fingerprints are in different places right? That means that the prints probably don't have anything to do with our case. They most likely belong to the owner of this evidence locker.
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
S-something wrong?
Phoenix:
I was just thinking, if you're so sure who it is, why don't you match the fingerprints?
Ema:
Mr. Wright! I was doing this for your benefit, so you'd learn!
Phoenix:
F-fine, fine! (Let me think... who could have left these prints...?)
Leads back to profile selection
Ema:
Ah hah! So these prints belonged to Detective Gumshoe!
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? You gave me this "so what?" look.
Phoenix:
I guess that's probably because I was thinking "so what?"
Ema:
Okay, so we came up with nothing this time, but there's always next time! Sometimes you hit, sometimes you miss! You gotta roll with the punches, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Thanks for the sympathy. (Wait... If I remember correctly... there was one other handprint in this room. Let's check it out!)
Examine
Locker with white cloth
Phoenix:
This is where we got a luminol fluid reaction, right?
Ema:
Right! There was a handprint here! Okay! Want to try using this?
Phoenix:
(There go her eyes sparkling again...)
Check for prints
Leads to:
"Okay, let's check for prints!"
Leave it be
Phoenix:
Actually, let's not check.
Ema:
What!?&#160;Why not!? Try my patience any longer and I'll dump this powder over your head!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe I better check for those prints after all.)
Phoenix:
Okay, let's check for prints!
Ema:
That's the spirit! Oh! But I have to warn you about something first.
Phoenix:
What?
Ema:
The area with the blood was wiped away, right?
Phoenix:
We only ended up finding it using chemical means.
Ema:
Any prints in that area will have been wiped away too.
Phoenix:
Oh... right. So... that means no prints.
Ema:
Would you say the probability of your hypothesis is high?
Phoenix:
D-don't ask me!
Ema:
Anyway... We must try to find prints that weren't wiped away.
Phoenix:
(Prints other than the ones left by the bloody hand...)
Leftmost non-bloody finger
Obtain incomplete print
Phoenix:
Hmm... I gave it my best shot.
Ema:
That kind of result won't be any good for matching prints, will it?
Phoenix:
But it doesn't look like we'll get a clearer result from this print.
Ema:
Ok, let's try a different finger, then!
Leads back to finger selection
Second non-bloody finger from left
Obtain fingerprint
Compare Jake Marshall profile
Comparing...Comparison complete.
Match found.
Leads to:
"Hey, these fingerprints, they..."
Compare anyone else
Comparing...Comparison complete.
No matches found.
Leads back to profile selection
Phoenix:
Hey, these fingerprints, they...
Ema:
Whose are they? Whose!? Is it someone I know?
Phoenix:
It's Officer Marshall!!!
Ema:
Huh? O-Officer Jake Marshall!?
Marshall's Fingerprints added to the Court Record.
Ema:
Th-that's got to be a coincidence! He's not involved in the crime!
Phoenix:
Ema. This* ([sic]) are decidedly different from Detective Gumshoe's prints.
Ema:
...!
Phoenix:The luminol reaction. The blood and the fingerprints are in the same place.
Ema:
Oh... Oh!!!
Phoenix:
(So, we have Jake Marshall's fingerprints... on a wiped bloodstain!)
Ema:
But why would Officer Marshall...
Phoenix:
It looks like our investigation is finally turning up some results!
Ema:
...!
Phoenix:
I guess this is what you'd call "decisive evidence"!
Ema:
I... I don't believe it!
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
Exit fingerprint checking session
Phoenix:
(I think I'd like to try one of the other fingerprints.)
Ema:
Okay, let's move on to a different finger!
