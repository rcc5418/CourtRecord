Episode 4Turnabout Goodbyes
It's been, what, 15 years?
About that, yes.
15 years is a long time to wait...
You can't imagine how much I've suffered...
You... suffered?
And now... the perfect opportunity presents itself.
At last... I shall have my revenge!
What!?
...Merry Christmas.
December 25, 10:08 AMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?
Phoenix:
Waterfalls...? Dare I ask why?
Maya:
Duh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!
Phoenix:
... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?
Maya:
Of course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!
Phoenix:
Umm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...
Maya:
Oh. Darn.
Phoenix:
Sorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?
Maya:
... Good idea!
Phoenix:
(So much for the rushing spring waters...) 
TV:
Next in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it "Gourdy" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ... 
Phoenix:*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?
Maya:
Nick?
Phoenix:
?
Maya:
The water pressure's kind of low in that shower.
Phoenix:
... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?
Maya:
... Good idea, Nick!
Phoenix:
(Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) 
TV:
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder! 
Phoenix:
(Gourd Lake again?) 
TV:
The body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... has he thrown it all away? 
Phoenix:
(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--
Maya:
Nick?
Phoenix:
Yipes! M-Maya!
Maya:
The fireman yelled at me when I called him.
Phoenix:
We've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!
Maya:
What? You mean, the prosecutor?
Phoenix:
Yeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!
Maya:
Whaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?
Phoenix:
I-I don't know!
Maya:
Let's go find out, Nick!
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
Mia's favorite plant. Its name is "Charley." Maya's gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley's been perking up these days.
Mia's desk
Phoenix:
Mia's desk. If we had more clients, I would probably sit here more often. Lately, I've been spending more time on the couch, watching TV.
Movie poster
Phoenix:
Maya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day. We had a big fight over whether to put it up or not. I know she's just waiting for a chance to sneak it up on the wall.
Window
Phoenix:
Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. I can see the bellboy, getting the angle of that screwdriver in the drawer just right.
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What do you mean!? Let's investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(You're right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!)
Any ideas
Phoenix:
Well? Got any good ideas?
Maya:
Not really. I do my best thinking when I'm standing underneath a waterfall.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
You know, I think it's developing a nice luster.
Maya:
I'll look at your badge later, Nick. We've got work to do!
Phoenix:
(I suppose you're right...)

Maya:
You know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?
Phoenix:
I guess it comes with the territory.
Maya:
I'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!
Phoenix:
... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!
Edgeworth:
What are you doing here!?
Maya:
Nick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.
Phoenix:
Well, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?
Edgeworth:
So, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?
Maya:
Nick... Should we be laughing?
Phoenix:
Nah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.
Edgeworth:
... Yes you do.
Phoenix:
(Actually, he's right.) 
Edgeworth:
... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.
Phoenix:
(Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.)
Examine
Surveillance camera
Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room.
Talk
What happened
Phoenix:
Edgeworth. Tell me what happened.
Edgeworth:
... Why should I? What are you going to do about it?
Maya:
Duh! We're going to help you, that's what!
Edgeworth:
...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous.
Phoenix:
Sorry...?
Edgeworth:
You're a novice! You've only been in three trials!
Phoenix:
H-hey!
Edgeworth:
Sure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Nick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!?
Gourd Lake
Phoenix:
The murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct?
Edgeworth:
Yes... late last night.
Phoenix:
The lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there?
Edgeworth:
... I see no need to tell you.
Maya:
M-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...?
Edgeworth:
... Gourdy.
Maya:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
I went to see Gourdy.
Maya:
"Gourdy"? What's that!?
Phoenix:
I'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?)
Did you do it (appears after What happened, Gourdy, and presenting Attorney's Badge)
Leads to:
"Edgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask..."
Present
Attorney's Badge
Edgeworth:
Your attorney's badge...?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth. Let me defend you.
Edgeworth:
... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet.
Maya:
Wh-what do you mean by that?
Edgeworth:
Me? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!
Maya:
Wh-what!?
Edgeworth:
My case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down.
Phoenix:
What?
Edgeworth:
Simply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared "guilty."
Phoenix:
I don't believe it!
Edgeworth:
Regardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this.
(Clearing "Did you do it" "Talk" option leads to:)
Phoenix:
Edgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right?
Edgeworth:
... Think what you will. I have only one request.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Stay out of this case.
Maya:
Why!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!
Edgeworth:
I know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay?
Maya:
!!! Why not?
Edgeworth:
... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!
Maya:
Nick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he.
Phoenix:
Maya! Let's go investigate elsewhere.
Maya:
But, Nick...

December 25Gourd Lake ParkEntrance 
Maya:
This is where it happened?
Phoenix:
Yeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.
Maya:
I can see some police walking around in there.
Phoenix:
Questioning people, probably.
Maya:
Hey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?
Gumshoe:
Well, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?
Police:
S-sorry, sir... Nothing.
Gumshoe:
Idiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!
Police:
B-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--
Gumshoe:
Shaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do! I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!
Police:
Y-yes, sir!
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!
Gumshoe:
Recruits... peh! ... Aah!
Maya:
Eek!
Gumshoe:
Hey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!
Phoenix:
Wright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?) 
Gumshoe:
And just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?
Phoenix:
Huh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.
Gumshoe:
Well, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!
Maya:
He seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...
Gumshoe:
Huh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...
Examine
Trees
Phoenix:
I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?
Maya:
I don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.
Phoenix:
(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)
Sign
Phoenix:
The sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend.
Maya:
But... no waterfall.
Phoenix:
Not many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya.
Talk
What happened
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?
Gumshoe:
Huh? You don't know, pal?
Phoenix:
No...
Gumshoe:
Wow, okay, Mr. head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.
Phoenix:
Head-in-the... huh?
Gumshoe:
Never mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol.
Maya:
And... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?
Gumshoe:
A cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.
Maya:
How did he get there so fast?
Gumshoe:
Well... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake.
Phoenix:
A witness?
Edgeworth
Maya:
You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?
Gumshoe:
Absolutely not! It's impossible! I don't care if there's a witness either! I don't believe a lick of it!
Maya:
R-right! Who cares what the witness says!
Phoenix:
(I care!)
Maya:
... You really believe in him, don't you, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Course I do! But... the police are pretty sure he's the killer. Nobody's even really taking this investigation that seriously.
Maya:
Oh no!
Gumshoe:
After all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one's standing up to take his side.
Maya:
Well, at least you are, Detective. At least you are.
Defense request
Maya:
Do you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth's defense attorney in tomorrow's trial?
Gumshoe:
He hasn't got one yet.
Maya:
What? The trial IS tomorrow, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
Well, I don't know the whole story... But apparently no one he's been talking to will take his case.
Maya:
W-why not?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth won't tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he'd asked you to defend him.
Phoenix:
U-unfortunately not...
Gumshoe:
Well, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn't just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you're an attorney!
Defense request (after presenting Attorney's Badge to Edgeworth)
Maya:
I-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case?
Gumshoe:
Yeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid.
Phoenix:
(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)
Gumshoe:
Hey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai! Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!
Phoenix:
I... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said.
Gumshoe:
What!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case! He kept saying "Wright, Wright, Wright" over and over.
Maya:
... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign.
Phoenix:
Neither am I...
Gumshoe:
Why wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it.
The witness (appears after What happened)
Phoenix:
Who was this witness?
Gumshoe:
Er, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow.
Phoenix:
Was there only that one witness?
Gumshoe:
Yep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty...
Maya:
Oh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick?
Phoenix:
Talk to Santa.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Gumshoe:
That badge! You're showing that to the wrong guy, pal! You gotta show that to someone who needs it!
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Police:
Detective Gumshoe, sir!
Gumshoe:
What? Find something!?
Police:
Um, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing...
Gumshoe:
A briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?
The autopsy report
Maya:
Well, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...?
Gumshoe:
Sorry... They haven't worked up the autopsy report yet. I'm still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal!
Leads to:
"You're not coming back, Detective?"
How to get in touch with you
Leads to:
"You're not coming back, Detective?"
Phoenix:
You're not coming back, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Erm... Probably not, pal.
Phoenix:
So, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?
Gumshoe:
Ah, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.
Detective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station.
Phoenix:
Oh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
W-what!?
Phoenix:
Um, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?
Gumshoe:
Yeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.
Maya:
You know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy.
Phoenix:
Yeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...
Maya:
Right! Now, let's get investigating!

Chief:
Something wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in? Okay, what did you do? Shoplifting? Larceny? Public indecency...?
Maya:
N-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around?
Chief:
Gumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon.
Maya:
Okay, we'll come back.
Chief:
You do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that?
Maya:
... Do I look like a criminal or something?
Examine
Poster
Phoenix:
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.
Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"...your mama could see you know she'd be crying'... ...a break and spit it out, you lowlife scumbag..."
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for interrogations.
Desk
Phoenix:
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.
Blue Badger
Phoenix:
Hey, is that the police department's mascot...?
Chief:
That's the "Blue Badger"! It was my idea! I made it! It's my mascot!
Phoenix:
I... see. How nice.
Chief:
I'll get him assigned mascot of the Criminal Affairs Dept. if it's the last thing I do!
Phoenix:
Um, good luck!
Chief
Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
Wha...!? "Gourd Lake...!" "Gourdy sighted"!!! I don't believe it!
Phoenix:
(Shouldn't you be reading something more important...?)
December 25Gourd LakePublic Beach
Maya:
Wowsers! This is "Gourd Lake"?
Phoenix:
Yup. I'm not sure it warrants a "wowsers," though.
Maya:
Hmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!
Phoenix:
"Samurai Dogs"...?
Maya:
I wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great!
Phoenix:
With a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?
Maya:
They're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into "The Pink Princess" now. I mean, like, y'know!?
Phoenix:
(Nope.)
Examine
Lake
Maya:
Wow. Gourd Lake is really big.
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Maya:
Say, Nick. Why is it called "Gourd Lake"?
Phoenix:
Oh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here.
Maya:
Whoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape?
Phoenix:
Well, it is shaped like a gourd, actually. But that's just a coincidence.
Maya:
Oh. Okay.
Trash
Phoenix:
The trashcan is empty. At least the place is well maintained.
Bench
Phoenix:
A lineup of plastic benches. I guess the idea is you buy a dog and eat it here. I doubt anyone would sit here and eat on a day like this. Except maybe Maya... if she had a Samurai Dog.
Sign
Phoenix:
Huh... I almost didn't see that signpost. "Left - Boat docks" "Right - Exit"
Stand
Phoenix:
A hotdog stand. It's closed... The Christmas fringe looks a little half-baked. The banner reads "Samurai Dogs"... Somebody needs to redecorate.
Popper
Maya:
Huh. Someone left one of those poppers here. You know, you pull the string...
Phoenix:
...and it goes "pop." Yeah, I know the ones. You see them a lot around New Year's.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! It might be a clue! Let's take it.
Phoenix:
C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop it, right?
Maya:
Was it that obvious?
Phoenix:
(A popper... hmm.)
Take it
Leads to:
"I suppose it couldn't hurt. Huh? Where'd it go?"
Leave it
Phoenix:
Nah, let's leave it.
Maya:
Aww, listen to your inner child a little, Nick!
Phoenix:
(Maybe if you outer child would be quiet for just a moment, Maya!)
Phoenix:
I suppose it couldn't hurt. Huh? Where'd it go?
Maya:
I already put it in my pocket.
Popper put in pocket.

December 25Boat Rental Shop
Maya:
Nick... what is this place?
Phoenix:
A boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either.
Maya:
Boats... I've never ridden on a boat.
Phoenix:
Really? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished?
Maya:
Hey, good idea! You bet!
Examine
Trees
Phoenix:
There's more forest off that way. I doubt I'd find any helpful clues in there.
Shop
Phoenix:
A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because it's Christmas.
Boats
Phoenix:
There are some boats floating at the dock. Was one of these boats used in the murder, I wonder?
Maya:
Nick?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
I changed my mind. I don't really want to go for a boat ride.
December 25Gourd Lake Woods
Maya:
I like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping!
Phoenix:
They've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder.
Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder!
Phoenix:
(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them.
Examine (left side)
Camera
Maya:
Hey, Nick. Check out this camera!
Phoenix:
Yeah... what's with the big mic and that box on top, I wonder? It looks like some sort of automatic system for taking a photo when a noise is heard.
Maya:
Wow! Hey, let's see if it works! *cough* "Hi, I'm Nick!" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. "YO! I'M NICK!!!" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!
Phoenix:
Will you stop that?
Maya:
I think it's broken, Nick.
Phoenix:
D-don't kick it! (It must not be set up to respond to voices.)

Sign
Phoenix:
The sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.
Maya:
Wait, what if the sign said "No Setting Tents on Fire"?
Phoenix:
... I don't think they have signs like that.
Maya:
Oh...
Sheet
Phoenix:
There's food and some magazines on the sheet. It takes a pretty tough skin to camp in this cold.
Campfire
Maya:
Hey, Nick!
Phoenix:
What, don't tell me you're hungry again?
Maya:
No, no. I was just wondering, why are camping pots and pans made of aluminum?
Phoenix:
... They didn't talk about that in any of the law books.
Maya:
So, there's no law saying they have to be made out of aluminum, then!
Phoenix:
(I'm not having this conversation...)
SUV
Phoenix:
This SUV has seen better days. It's dented all over. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.
Phoenix:
This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment. It must take pictures when triggered by a noise.
Maya:
Wow! Cool! Let's try it out! *cough* "Hi, I'm Nick!" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. "HEY! I'M NICK!!!" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!
Phoenix:
Will you stop that?
Maya:

Maya:
Ah? Wha... huh? S-sorry!

Sorry's nice but it don't pay my bills! Y'all know how much a roll of film costs!?
Maya:
I-I'll pay you back!

Maya:
Uh... well...
???:
What! Don't try to play stupid with me just 'cause you think I'm some country bumpkin! Yeah, I know how y'all Yanks think! "I say, those southern folks talk with that exaggerated drawl, why they must be dumb!" Well let me tell you, just because I might be dumb don't mean we all are!
Maya:
N-Nick, help!

And who are you, now? Her chaperone?
Phoenix:
Yeah, uh, no, rather, uhh... we're sort of... friends?
???:
Jus' figure out what y'all are gonna say and say it for bejeezum's sake! Gawd, I'd rather sit through one of papa's drawls than listen to you stutter all day.
Phoenix:
(Oh boy... I guess we should pay her for the film...)
???:
Watch it!
Phoenix:
Yes ma'am. (On second thought, I'll pay later...)
Maya:
I'm really sorry!
Examine (left side)
Camera
Phoenix:
This camera is rigged to respond to noise. But it only responds to loud noises... like a party popper.

Phoenix:
Ummm...

What!? Can't ya see I'm changin' the film on my camera here! Someone--I'm not namin' any names--but someone used up a WHOLE ROLL.

Phoenix:
N-no, that's not it at all. We're here investigating a murder that took place here, on the lake.
???:
A murder...? ... Sounds cool! Why didn't y'all say that in the first place! Go ahead, ask me anything ya like!
Phoenix:
(Finally! Some cooperation!)
???:
You too. Y'all can come out of hiding now. I won't bite. Hard.

What happened
Lotta:
Oh yeah, when was that murder, anyway? I ain't seen much television lately.
Phoenix:
It happened late in the night on Christmas Eve.
Lotta:
That so? Christmas Eve?
Phoenix:
A man on a boat was shot... Did you see anything?
Lotta:
Well, lemme see. A boat, ya say? I reckon I mighta seen one... not sure though. Y'all gotta remember I've been watching this here lake for a good three days now. I seen enough boats to choke a mule. Kinda hard to remember which I seen when.
Lotta
Maya:
So, what is it you do, Lotta?
Lotta:
Huh? Me? Hah hah. Y'all don't really want to know that, do ya? Actually, I'm a research student at Country U., right in the heart of the heartland.
Maya:
Wow! Neat! Nick! She's a research student at a university! Country U.!
Phoenix:
Uh... so I hear.
Maya:
So, when did you come up here?
Lotta:
Hmm, lemme see... I guess it was 'bout three days ago.
Phoenix:

Lotta:
D-didn't I tell y'all that already? Meteors! Yep, meteor showers!
Phoenix:

That's quite a camera you have there.
Lotta:

Phoenix:

Maya:
Umm... So, what's that device you have stuck to the camera?
Lotta:
Huh? Device?
Maya:
It started moving all by itself when I fired my party popper...
Lotta:
Oh that? That triggers the shutter whenever it detects certain sounds. It's programmed to pick up loud noises right now.
Maya:
A programmable camera! Neat!

Phoenix:
Actually, the victim in the case we're researching--he was shot with a pistol.
Lotta:
A pistol...?
Phoenix:
Right. Now wouldn't a gunshot make a similar noise to our party popper...?
Lotta:
I guess it would.
Phoenix:
Your camera... didn't get a picture of the murder, did it?
Lotta:
... Hey! Y'all are pretty bright!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Lotta:
I see what yer sayin'... Tell ya what, I'll have a look-see at my film.
Phoenix:
It would have been a photo taken late last night...
Lotta:
I checked 'em once, don't remember if there was anything on 'em though. But what if I got sumtin'! I could be witness to a genuine murder! Yeehaw! I'll go check that film. Y'all come back now, y'hear?

Not a word.

So, how did the meeting go?
Gumshoe:
I can't tell you, pal! You're a lawyer!
Phoenix:
T-true...
Gumshoe:
... Y'know... I don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, Mr. Edgeworth's human like you or me. Still... I get the feeling that if he'd done something wrong, he wouldn't go hiding it. That's just the kind of guy he is. Why can't anyone else see that?
Maya:
So, they think that Mr. Edgeworth did it...?
Gumshoe:
Well, the trial's starting tomorrow, as scheduled.
Maya:
I see...
Gumshoe:
...
Phoenix:
Umm... hey, in the end you did tell us about the meeting!
Gumshoe:
... Don't go telling anyone else, pal.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, sir!
Gumshoe:
And... do me a favor! Stand by Mr. Edgeworth! He needs help, and you're the ones to help him! I'm sure he's got some reason why he won't talk to us.
Maya:
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe.
Trusting Edgeworth (appears after The meeting)
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe... How come you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much?
Gumshoe:
Well, I'd think that was obvious. We got a strong working relationship, us two. We trust each other, and that's how it works.
Maya:
A "working relationship"?
Gumshoe:
See, Mr. Edgeworth always gets his defendants declared "guilty" every time. Yeah, his methods right be a little extreme at times. But... there's a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That's why I work extra hard, pal. We've got to earn that trust he places in us.
Maya:
I see...
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth is a man you can trust... And you have my word on that!

What? Edgey's got a proboscis on his knee!?

No, no--he's a "prosecuting attorney." That's like the total opposite of a defense lawyer!
Butz:
... Huh. Go figure! He always used to talk about defending the "weak" who were "unable to defend themselves." Man, he used to go on and on about man's duty to society and all that. What a bore! I wonder that changed his mind, though? Do you know, Nick?

That was the incident where the police were so at a loss they used a spirit medium.

Yes, my dear. The spirit medium, Misty Fey, your mother, contacted the spirit of the victim. But... the case was a loss. No conviction was made.

The DL-6 Incident, yes... Happened 15 years ago. A very strange case, indeed.

They never caught the criminal, right?
Grossberg:
Correct. Misty Fey used her powers to talk to the spirit of the late victim. Her testimony led to charges being laid against one man. But Mr. Hammond won the case and the suspect was declared innocent.

Yes... she said it was to photograph "shooting stars."
Grossberg:
Hmm. Shooting stars... explosions... what's the connection? I'd be suspicious of this witness of yours.
Autopsy Report
Grossberg:
Hmm? Strange... I feel as though I've seen this man somewhere before! ... Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
Did you remember!?
Grossberg:
He was a lawyer! Here, in my office! That's Hammond! Robert Hammond!
Maya:
Mr. Hammond...?
Grossberg:
And you say this is the man Miles Edgeworth shot?
Lake Photo
Grossberg:
So this is the moment the crime took place, eh?
Phoenix:
Yes.
Grossberg:
You can't really say for sure that's Edgeworth. I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Not sure at all...
Misty Fey's Photo
Grossberg:
Misty Fey. Mother of Mia and Maya Fey. Show this photograph to Miles Edgeworth. He'll have something to say to you then.
Anything else
Grossberg:
Er... my apologies. I'm not sure I can help you with that.
(Clearing "The DL6 Incident" "Talk" option leads to:)
Grossberg:
Show him this... I'm sure he'll talk to you.
Maya:
Wait... This is a photograph of my mother!

Edgeworth:
What's this? I was hoping you'd gotten my message the first time.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth, what about your defense?
Edgeworth:
...! It's no concern of yours.
Phoenix:
(Guess he hasn't found anyone yet.)
Talk
What happened
Phoenix:
Can I ask you about the murder?
Edgeworth:
Wright. I'll ask you again, just leave me alone.
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
Please try to understand. I'm not doing this to prove I'm tough, or because I look down on you. I just don't want you anywhere near this case. Understand?
Gourd Lake
Phoenix:
Why did you go to Gourd Lake?
Edgeworth:
I have no intention of telling you.
Phoenix:
Nor, apparently, would you tell Detective Gumshoe.

Maya:
Detective Gumshoe was really worried about you!

The DL6 Incident (appears after presenting Misty Fey's Photo)
Edgeworth:
The "DL-6 Incident"... was when my father died. Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all.
Maya:
...!
Edgeworth:
My memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it's a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It's pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect's name.
Phoenix:
And Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder?
Edgeworth:
Correct.
Maya:
Umm... That spirit medium... that was my mom.
Edgeworth:
What? You mean you're...? ... It's strange. I thought that terrible incident was about to end, and now... this.
Phoenix:
"About to end"?
Edgeworth:
The DL-6 Incident happened 15 years ago. 15 years ago... on December 28.
Maya:
December 28?
Edgeworth:
The statute of limitations on the case runs out in three days.
Phoenix:
What!?
Maya:
Um, Nick? What odes that mean?
Phoenix:
When a case's statute of limitations runs out, legally, the case never happened.
Edgeworth:
Three days from now, DL-6 will be closed... forever.
The suspect (appears after The DL6 Incident)
Maya:
What happened to the suspect? The one who got off innocent?
Edgeworth:
I don't know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he's still alive, he'd be about 50 years old now.
Phoenix:
(I guess I can understand why he'd go into hiding... It'd be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.)
Your father (appears after The DL6 Incident)
Maya:
Umm... so, was your father a lawyer?
Edgeworth:
He was... Gregory Edgeworth. He was quite famous at the time, apparently.
Maya:
So, you were sort of trying to follow in his footsteps.
Edgeworth:
... I'd rather not talk about it.

Attorney's Badge
Edgeworth:
Your attorney's badge...? I can't say I really want to see one of those right now.

Edgeworth:
...! ...
Phoenix:
Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It's only been a matter of hours since you last visited. Yet you've made incredible progress in your investigation. I'll admit it, I'm impressed, Wright. You were always single-minded in your work, though. Once you start on something, you always see it through, don't you?
Phoenix:
About the "DL-6 Incident"...
Edgeworth:
Right... DL-6. I didn't want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I'm sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren't up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6.
Phoenix:
So... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away?
Edgeworth:
I don't know. But... I see no point in hiding anything from you now. Very well. Ask whatever you like, and I will answer to the best of my abilities.
(Clearing all "Talk" options and presenting Lake Photo leads to:)
Edgeworth:
... Wright.
Phoenix:
?
Edgeworth:
It pains me to ask you this now...
Maya:
I know! You want us to defend you!
Edgeworth:
Yes... Will you?
Of course we will
Phoenix:
Ah, who could have guessed this day would come?
Edgeworth:
Not me.
Leads to:
"This is my chance to finally pay you back."
Of course we won't
Phoenix:
Sorry, charley! No way!
Edgeworth:
Wright...
Maya:
Nick...!? ...
Phoenix:
H-hey, don't look so serious, guys! I was kidding! Just a little joke!
Edgeworth:
There was nothing little...
Maya:
...or joke-like about it!
Phoenix:
(I thought it was funny...)
Maya:
Nick! Do it over!
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. How could I refuse you, Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Thank you, Wright.
Leads to:
"This is my chance to finally pay you back."
Phoenix:
This is my chance to finally pay you back.
Maya:
Pay him back...?
Edgeworth:
Pay me back? For what? I don't remember ever doing anything for you.
Phoenix:
Never mind... I guess you don't really need to know.
Edgeworth:
Huh... My letter of request. Please give it to Detective Gumshoe.
Edgeworth's Request put in pocket.
Phoenix:
Well, I guess we should... ... W-what's that!?
Maya:
E-earthquake! Nick! It's a big one! Whaaaaa! I-it's calming down... ... Whew... that was scary!
Phoenix:
...? Huh? Where's Edgeworth?
Maya:
... There. He's on the floor in a ball, shivering. I guess he doesn't do so well with earthquakes.
Phoenix:
(I've heard of running, but curling up in a ball?)
Maya:
Well, I guess we're done. Mr. Edgeworth doesn't seem like he's going to stand up any time soon. Let's go, Nick.
Phoenix:
Uh.. right. We have to give Edgeworth's letter of request to Detective Gumshoe.
December 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs
Gumshoe:
What's going on here!?
Maya:
Eek!
Phoenix:
W-what's wrong, Detective?
Gumshoe:
This wild lady comes in here just a while ago... Says she came "to talk to y'all after hearing what Mr. Wright had to say"! What's this all about, pal!?
Phoenix:
(Lotta Hart...)
Gumshoe:
Why are you going around finding more witnesses!? You want to give Mr. Edgeworth the death sentence, pal!?
Phoenix:
N-no, not at all... Just... I mean, she did see something. There's nothing I can do about that. I can't go around covering up evidence!
Gumshoe:
Er... You trying to say something about the way I do my job?
Phoenix:
No sir!
Examine
Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"Never talk to people in the neighborhood... Turn all the lights in the room off, and close the curtains..."
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for a stake-out.
Talk
Lotta's testimony
Phoenix:
So... what did Ms. Hart say?
Gumshoe:
She says she saw Mr. Edgeworth fire the pistol.
Maya:
What!?
Gumshoe:
She even had a photograph to prove it.
Phoenix:
Right. I saw it too... But you really can't tell from the photo who it is shooting.
Gumshoe:
That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said "it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"
Maya:
She can do that!?
Phoenix:
(Okay, so there's going to be an enlarged photograph that shows Edgeworth in the act. Great. Just great.)
Gumshoe:
In any case, she's going to be the one testifying tomorrow.
Maya:
Huh? What happened to the other witness?
Gumshoe:
Well... Apparently, there was a cancellation.
Phoenix:
(A "cancellation"...!?)
Tomorrow's trial
Gumshoe:
I'm afraid tomorrow is going to be life or death for poor Mr. Edgeworth. We got a witness who says she saw the very moment of the murder. And we got a photo taken when the shot rang out.
Phoenix:
(I'd say that sounds like a pretty unwinnable case... But wait... What did Mia used to say? If he's innocent, there's got to be something I've overlooked...)
Edgeworth
Gumshoe:
It sound like Mr. Edgeworth is going to ask the state to assign a public defender. I was just asked to file the paperwork. But you still got time, pal! Go talk to him again, for me, please! You have to convince him! You have to make him let you defend him! Please! I know you're the only one who can do it, pal. You're the only one who can save Mr. Edgeworth!
Present
Edgeworth's Request
Leads to:
"Look what I got."
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal, there's only one thing I want to see from you! And that's a letter of request from Mr. Edgeworth for you to be his defense attorney!
Phoenix:
Look what I got.
Gumshoe:
... Hey, you did it, pal! Glad I waited till the last minute to file those papers! I'll rip 'em up and start new ones for you!
Phoenix:
Thanks, Detective. Well, see you in court tomorrow, then.
Gumshoe:
Good luck, pal.
Gumshoe:
Hey! You guys feel that earthquake a little while back? I was worried!
Maya:
Worried? We're fine! I've lived out here my whole life. I'm pretty used to them by now.
Gumshoe:
Oh, I wasn't worried about you two. I was worried about Mr. Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
(Oh, right...) He did seem to over-react a little, now that you mention it.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, well, I'm not surprised. It was a pretty big quake. I'm going to go check on him. You two go eat and get your rest for tomorrow's trial. Later!
Maya:
... I wonder what it is with Mr. Edgeworth and earthquakes?
Phoenix:
I wonder... He was never that scared of them when he was in school.
Phoenix:
(Then again, I was only in the same class as him for 4th grade. He transferred to another school after that. I wonder what happened to Edgeworth...)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
