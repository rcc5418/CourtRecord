Phoenix:
Whew, what a day.
Maya:
This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?
Phoenix:
I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.
Maya:
The director and producer...?
Phoenix:
Yeah, them.
Maya:
Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
What do you think we should do?
Maya:
W-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here.
Maya:
That's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto!
Any ideas
Maya:
Hmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
That's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
There's not enough information!
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Hey, see this?
Maya:
You... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick?
Cardkey
Maya:
Hey, you still have that! Great!
Phoenix:
Well, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell...
Maya:
Poor old WP...
Powers's(?) Photo
Maya:
You know, what if this really was Mr. Powers?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag.
Maya:
So Mr. Powers is... lying?
Phoenix:
He really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...)
Samurai Spear
Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?
Anything else
Maya:
Sorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out.

Will:
Oh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier.
Phoenix:
Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.
Maya:
You can say that again!
Phoenix:
Let's not.
Maya:
So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?
Will:
Hmm... S-sorry, but no.
Maya:
Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.
Phoenix:
We can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow.
Will:
Y-yes... *sniff*
Examine
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room.
Talk
The fanboy
Phoenix:
Do, er, "fanboys" sneak into the studios often?
Will:
No, not that I know of. That security lady's pretty strict with them.
Maya:
But, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around?
Will:
The kids really, really love the Steel Samurai. They sneak past when she's not looking, I guess.
The director
Phoenix:
Was the director present at the morning run-through?
Will:
Y-yes, yes he was. He was directing how the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate should move.
Maya:
Why didn't you tell us that before!?
Will:
W-well, just, the studio asked us to keep quiet...
Maya:
That has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big!
Will:
I... I see. *sniff*
Phoenix:
(Whose side is she on!?)
Maya:
You aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!?
Will:
N-no, I sure hope not.
Present
Cardkey
Phoenix:
We found this cardkey in your dressing room.
Will:
Oh, that's mine, yes.
Maya:
Can people outside the studios get these cards?
Will:
I don't think so. Even I have to return the card. Once the show's done filming, that is.
Maya:
Huh...
Powers's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
Regarding this photograph...
Will:
Y-yes...?
Phoenix:
This really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right?
Will:
R-right. *sniff* I was sleeping in my dressing room the whole time, honest.
Phoenix:
But who else could have worn it!?
Maya:
Your costume was in your dressing room?
Will:
Yes. I guess they snuck in and took it while I was asleep.
Phoenix:
(But who!?)
Samurai Spear
Phoenix:
Regarding the murder weapon...
Will:
Yes?
Phoenix:
Is it heavy, that spear?
Will:
It's pretty hefty, yeah. I don't think the average person would be able to swing it around effectively.
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Maya:
And... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through?
Will:
Oh yes, I goofed on a round kick, you see... I broke the spear. The security lady fixed it for me right away though.
Maya:
With duct tape. We heard.
Anything else
Will:
E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way I could help you... S-sorry. *sniff*

Maya:
No one's here.
Phoenix:
Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her...
Maya:
H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!
Examine
Computer
Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day.
Guard station
Phoenix:
The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there.
Main gate
Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there.

Maya:
Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.
Phoenix:
You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.
Maya:
So, Nick... Remember that "Studio Two" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I think that's what they said.
Maya:
Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!
Examine
Bench
Phoenix:
I'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit.
Maya:
This is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever.
Phoenix:
H-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired!
Maya:
Nick, when you start having to say "I'm still young," you know it's all over.
Phoenix:
(But... but I AM still young!)
Left path
Phoenix:
In the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem.
Maya:
This monkey head is real heavy!
Phoenix:
Well, it did knock that tree over when it fell.
Maya:
Both of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said.
Mr. Monkey
Phoenix:
The studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before!
Maya:
Why don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing.
Maya:
Probably so.
Security camera
Phoenix:
That's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.
Studio One entrance
Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
WELCOME sign
Maya:
It says "Welcome."
Phoenix:
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?
Maya:
Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
Phoenix:
Sure, if that security lady lets us in.

Maya:
I... don't really want to be in here.
Phoenix:
Yeah... It is a murder scene.
Maya:
I want to go someplace else. Nick?
Phoenix:
(*sigh*...)
Examine
Film camera
Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!
Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!
Maya:
Hey, smile, Nick, you're a star!
Phoenix:
S-stop that!
Reflecting screen
Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)
Stage backdrop
Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
October 18Studio Two Entrance
Maya:
This... is Studio Two?
Phoenix:
I thought so...
Maya:
It doesn't really look much like a "studio," does it?
Phoenix:
No, that it does not.
Maya:
Hey... There's a trailer over there.
Phoenix:
It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer.
Maya:
Are we sure this is a studio?
Examine (left side)
Incinerator
Phoenix:
An incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much.
Lunch table
Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.
Maya:
Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too.
Phoenix:
What is it with steaks around here?
Maya:
Hey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place...
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
I... don't know. It just feels "odd."
Number "2" sign
Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here.
Maya:
Probably because this is Studio Two?
Phoenix:
Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.
Studio van
Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.
Maya:
Well, let's go for a drive!
Phoenix:
Sure... if I had a license.
Maya:
Nick! You don't have a driver's license!?
Phoenix:
But, look, I have this!
Maya:
Why are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick?
Examine (right side)
Flower garden
Phoenix:
There're some flowers here.
Maya:
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
Phoenix:
Don't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous.
Storage materials
Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set.
Maya:
They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.
Trailer
Phoenix:
On closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set.
Trailer door
Maya:
Nick! Let's go inside!
Phoenix:
You think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked.
Maya:
Aww... shucks.
October 18Global StudiosEmployee Area
Maya:
Look, it's that assistant girl. Hey!
Penny:
Hi... WP's lawyers, right? I heard about the trial! Great job, guys!
Phoenix:
Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it.
Penny:
Is it true they caught the security lady!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Oh... oh hoh hoh!
Penny:
Actually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain...
Phoenix:
You mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)
Penny:
I... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?
Maya:
Yeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?
Penny:
R-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.
Maya:
Oh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!
Penny:
You're right! I won't!
Phoenix:
(Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...)
Penny:
Um, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag.
Maya:
Right! See you later, then!
Penny:
Good luck with your investigation.
Examine (left side)
Drain grate
Maya:
So, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain?
Phoenix:
So it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry.
Maya:
Hey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in.
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. I think that was the idea...?
Maya:
I feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you?
Phoenix:
What, you want to rip the grate off?
Maya:
Really, Nick? We can!?
Phoenix:
(Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...)
Rip it open
Leads to:
"Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken."
Leave it be
Phoenix:
Nah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who.
Maya:
Yeah... I guess so.
Phoenix:
(Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...)
Phoenix:
Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken.
Maya:
Yay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes.
Phoenix:
(Sometimes...?)
Maya:
Hiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy.
Phoenix:
The things we do...
Drain grate (after reopening)
Phoenix:
The drain grate is off. And I know who did it.
Maya:
Now the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that?
Phoenix:
(Must be nice to live so free of guilt.)
Lunch table
Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
Examine (right side)
Dressing room door
Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal?
Phoenix:
H-hey! We're not thieves!
Maya:
But we did take that cardkey...
Phoenix:
W-we borrowed that! There's a difference.
Vending machine
Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:
Be my guest.
Maya:
Okay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out.

October 18Global StudiosDressing Room
Maya:
This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.
Phoenix:
That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.
Maya:
But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?
Phoenix:
Huh... (She's got a point!)
Examine
Cosmetics
Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Maya:
"Samurai Boogey-Woogey," Nick! Get with the picture!
Phoenix:
Look, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)
Costume rack
Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes.
Couch
Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said.
Powers's bag
Maya:
Mr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked.
Phoenix:
Maya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!)
Table
Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Wait... Nick!
Phoenix:
W-what now?
Maya:
These snacks... they've passed the expiration date!
Phoenix:
... Then don't eat them.
Maya:
*grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!)
Window
Phoenix:
It's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside.
Studio - Main Gate
Penny:
Oh... hello.
Maya:
Ho hoh! You look a little out of place.
Penny:
It's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an "alternative guard fashion" thing.
Examine
Guard station
Phoenix:
The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.
Penny:
Oh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew.
Talk
The studios
Phoenix:
So, how are the studios doing?
Penny:
There's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me "disturbing evidence." I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder!
Phoenix:
You mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area?
Penny:
Yeah. Can you believe it?
The fanboy
Maya:
Do kids sneak in here a lot?
Penny:
Well... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though...
The director, et al.
Phoenix:
I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...
Penny:
Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet.
Maya:
So they were trying to protect the director?
Penny:
More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!
Phoenix:
(The producer, huh?)
Present
Cardkey
Penny:
Wow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys?
Phoenix:
Well, I'm sort of borrowing it.
Penny:
I see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here.
Phoenix:
(I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful.
Powers's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this?
Penny:
That's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway?
Phoenix:
(Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind.
Samurai Spear
Phoenix:
Say, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon...
Penny:
You mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around.
Phoenix:
(So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?)
Anything else
Penny:
Umm... Not really sure what that is. Sorry.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder?
Manella:
Oh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh?
Phoenix:
That's right.
Manella:
It was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch!&#160;:(
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, was it?
Manella:
Yeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food...
Maya:
Nick... what does "Sucksores" mean?
Phoenix:
No idea...
Manella:
Anyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...)
The producer (appears after The day of the crime)
Phoenix:
About the producer who was at the meeting with you...
Manella:
Oh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?
Manella:
Yeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time.
The bigwigs (appears after The day of the crime)
Phoenix:
Who exactly are these "bigwigs" people keep mentioning?
Manella:
Oh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats*
Phoenix:
Were all of them with you the entire time?
Manella:
Yeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl*
Phoenix:
(Hmm... sounds like they'd all be reliable witnesses.)
Present
Powers's(?) Photo
Manella:
... T-this is WP, right?
Phoenix:
How do you know?
Manella:
Well, look, he's obviously dragging his foot.
Phoenix:

I try not to pay much attention to things that don't interest me. LOL.

No answer.
Maya:
Pretty suspicious, if you ask me, Nick! Let's go in!
Phoenix:
I'm not sure we should be barging in... ...Huh. It's locked.
Maya:
What? Don't we have a key?
Phoenix:
No. But there's probably one in the guard station at the main gate.
Maya:
Then what are we waiting for? Let's borrow it!
Phoenix:

Oldbag:
Oh the police took me away, they did. They pulled out a spare Steel Samurai costume! Told me to "put it on." Can you imagine? How could I, a sweet little old lady, wear a giant suit like that?
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers is pretty tall...
Oldbag:
As soon as they saw there was no way I could wear it, they let me go.
Phoenix:
(I guess that would rule out her being the murderer.)
Oldbag:
Anyway! Know this, whippersnapper! This old lady NEVER forgets a slight or insult! And you won't get any information out of me! My lips are sealed!

You sure are talking a lot for someone with sealed lips.

H-hah! Hah hah! You can't fool me!
Maya:
Okay... then what's the last line said by the innkeeper in Episode 8?

Hah! Easy! "Like some fries with that?"

Left poster
Phoenix:
Another old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
Maya:
Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know.
Phoenix:
Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet?
Middle poster
Phoenix:
"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer." This poster's quite old.
Maya:
Wow! It's been years since I saw that show! It was one of those typical summer romance stories... but it was great!
Phoenix:
A typical summer romance... with a samurai on a horse?
Right poster
Phoenix:
An old movie poster. "'Dynamite Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." I guess Mr. Hammer used to be quite the star.

This is where they had that meeting. There are documents and paper cups scattered around.

Nothing in here that could be a clue. Just some paper cups and crumpled documents.

Phoenix:
Hey, don't get mad at me.
The director
Phoenix:
About the director... Sal Manella, was it? What, er, exactly is his role here...?
Vasquez:
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear? I'm looking for a script. I can't be bothered with anything else. ...

Maya:
Y-yes. Anything you could tell us would be a big help.
Vasquez:
... You know there was a meeting here at noon?
Phoenix:
Yes. With the director and the people from the network...
Vasquez:
Correct. Now, listen closely. None of the people in this trailer that afternoon went to Studio One. It was impossible for us to leave.
Maya:
Impossible? Why?
Vasquez:
The path was blocked.
Phoenix:
The... path?
Talk
The blocked path (appears after presenting Script)
Leads to:
"On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?"
Phoenix:
On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?
Vasquez:
You saw Mr. Monkey on the way here, correct?
Phoenix:
M-"Mr. Monkey"?
Vasquez:
The monkey with the broken head.
Phoenix:
Oh, right, that... (What an original name...)
Vasquez:
Its head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capsice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One.
Maya:
W-what!?
Vasquez:
It's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.
Phoenix:
B-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One!
Vasquez:
2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come.
Leads to:
"..."
Outside Studio One
Vasquez:
... That's "Mr. Monkey." When it wasn't broken, it announced the time... in "ooks." One "ook" per hour. Ook ook ook ook. Always with the ooking.
Phoenix:
(It IS a monkey, after all.)
Vasquez:
Check its head. The clock inside stopped when it broke.
Maya:
...! Nick, it's stopped at 2:15.
Phoenix:
2:15...?
Vasquez:
That's right. This path was blocked from 2:15 till after 4:00. Therefore, we're innocent.
Phoenix:
Mr. Hammer died in Studio One at 2:30...
Vasquez:
See? Good bye.
Mr. Monkey data added to the Court Record.
Maya:
What do we do, Nick? There isn't anyone besides WP who could have killed Hammer! It's over... We're finished!

I really want to take a break, but we have work to do! Still, it's kind of sad to see so many empty benches... Kind of like if you threw a party, and nobody came.

A collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure.
Reflecting screen

A stage backdrop. This is "Neo Fujiyama," according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind.
Stepladder

But that's my card! By offering me something I already own, you're in effect eschewing the very basis of our consumer society, namely the principle of fair trade! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!

Cody:
Whatever, I don't need that card.

Huh?

I got a double. Just keep it. It's yours.
Phoenix:

Cody:
If you want to trade, find me a REALLY rare card!

"Really rare"!? You mean there's something rarer than "Ultra Rare"!?
Cody:
Ultra Rare Premium cards are way rarer than plain Ultra Rare cards! Come ON! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:

After WHAT happened?
Penny:
Y-you mean, you don't know about Hammer...?
Phoenix:
No, what?
Penny:
I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.
What happened (appears after Mr. Hammer)
Phoenix:
Wait, now you have to tell me. What happened with Hammer?
Penny:
I-I'm sorry. I'm probably not the one who should tell you.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. Why do I get the feeling something's being covered up here?)
Present
Steel Samurai Card
Phoenix:
Do you know anything about this?
Penny:
Hey, that's a Steel Samurai trading card. I collect those, actually. I'm one card away from a complete set!
Phoenix:
A complete set?
Penny:
Yeah, a set of one of each card.
Phoenix:
Huh...
Penny:
... Wait...Waitwaitwaitwait!!! That's it!!! That's the card I need! You don't know how long I've been looking for it!
Phoenix:
Uh...
Penny:
I don't care what kind of girl you might think I am, I need that card! P-please! I beg you! Please trade with me!
Phoenix:
T-trade with you?
Penny:
Yes, trade cards! Look, I'll even trade you an Ultra Rare Premium card!
Phoenix:
Trade me a... huh?
Penny:
Yes, it's a good deal for your Ultra Rare! Please!!!
Mia:
Phoenix! Can't you see she's desperate?
Phoenix:
(W-what's everybody getting so excited about...?)
Trade
Phoenix:
Okay.
Leads to:
"Really!? Th-thanks!!! Then this is for you."
Don't trade
Phoenix:
No... no, I can't. See, this card isn't really even mine.
Penny:
!!! I... I see. O-of course. Of course it wouldn't be yours. Of course you couldn't trade it with me. Of course I won't ever get that card, ever. Of course I don't even really deserve that card.
Mia:
Phoenix, do something! She's blacking out!
Phoenix:
O-o-okay, okay! I'll trade!
Leads to:
"Really!? Th-thanks!!! Then this is for you."
Anything else
Penny:
Umm... Sorry. I'm really Not sure what that is.
Penny:
Really!? Th-thanks!!! Then this is for you.
URP Card added to the Court Record.
Penny:
Yaa-hoo!
Phoenix:
(And there she goes...)
Mia:
Doesn't doing good things like that make you feel great?
Phoenix:
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Dressing Room
Present
URP Card
Leads to:
"See this card?"
Phoenix:
See this card?
Cody:
Yeah, so... Wait! That's it!!! That's the last Ultra Rare Premium card I need! C'mon give it to me, please! You gotta give it to me!
Phoenix:
(Wow, I've never seen him so... eager.) R-right! Okay! How about a trade?
Cody:
You're on! I'll give you a "Samurai Spear" and throw in an "Evil Magistrate" to boot!!
Phoenix:
No no no no... not that kind of trade. I don't want cards. I want information.
Cody:
Huh? You sure? Fine by me!
Gave URP Card to Cody.
Mia:
Okay, Phoenix. Let's hear what he has to say. If he knows something that could help us, we can have him take the stand tomorrow.
Talk (after presenting URP Card)
The Steel Samurai
Phoenix:
So... you like the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
He's so cool!
Phoenix:
I... I guess.
Cody:
You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life!
Phoenix:
(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)
Cody:
You like him too, don'tcha?
Phoenix:
Uh... Oh, me? Y-yeah! I, um, love the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!
His kind nature
Phoenix:
R-right... (C'mon, think of something!) I really like his, um, his kind nature. What a guy!
Cody:
Totally! He looks so tough, but inside, he's as gentle as a kitten!
Phoenix:
Yeah...
Cody:
So, what else do you like about him?
Phoenix:
(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)
Leads back to:
"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!"
His fighting skills
Leads to:
"(Got to think of something...)"
Will Powers's acting
Phoenix:
W-well... (I've never even seen a full episode of that dumb show.) A-actually, I'm kind of a fan of Will Powers...
Cody:
Whoa! That's totally hard-core!
Phoenix:
(You're calling ME hard-core?)
Cody:
So, what else do you like about him?
Phoenix:
(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)
Leads back to:
"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!"
Phoenix:
(Got to think of something...) I like it when he, uh, he vanquishes his foes!
Cody:
Yeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album!
Phoenix:
What the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
I go to every live performance!
Phoenix:
(Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?)
Cody:
I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera!
Mia:
Wow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it?
Cody:
You bet, lady! I just got it for my birthday. My album has a name, wanna hear it? "The Steel Samurai: Path To Glory." The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Hey, if you want this, you can have it, lady.
Mia:
Really? Are you sure?
Cody:
Yeah, I took these with a digital camera. I got all the data at home so I can always make another one.
Mia:
Well, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you.
"Path to Glory" received.
Phoenix:
(What's with people always giving stuff to Mia? What a life!)
Mia:
?
The Steel Samurai (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
So... you like the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
Well, yeah! Duh! He's so strong!
Phoenix:
I... I guess.
Cody:
You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life!
Phoenix:
(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)
What happened
Phoenix:
You were here on the day of the... incident, right?
Cody:
Yeah...
Phoenix:
Did you see anything unusual?
Cody:
...
Mia:
Cody.
Cody:
!
Mia:
Cody, he needs to know because he's fighting for justice. Isn't that the Steel Samurai's motto? "For great justice"? You have to help us fight for great justice, too.
Cody:
I... I saw... I saw everything!
Phoenix:
(Well, well... We might get some useful information out of him yet.)
What you saw (appears after The Steel Samurai and What happened)
Leads to:
"Cody... I need to ask you something very important."
Present
"Path to Glory"
Phoenix:
Thanks for this.
Cody:
Hey, I gave that to the nice lady, not you, loser! No looking at that, okay!
Phoenix:
(Believe me, I wasn't going to...)
(Talking about "What you saw" leads to:)
Phoenix:
Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?
Cody:
... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that...
Mia:
What is it, Cody?
Cody:
Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.
Phoenix:
I... I see. It must have been hard for you.
Cody:
Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.
Phoenix:
(Umm... right.) Mia?
Mia:
Yes?
Phoenix:
I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.
Mia:
True enough.
Phoenix:
And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.
Mia:
Indeed.
Phoenix:
So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!
Mia:
... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be "guilty" for sure.
Phoenix:
Let's not call him then...
Mia:
I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.
???:
Not so fast, pal!
Gumshoe:
I heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct!
Cody:
No! I ain't going! Waah!
Mia:
... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court.
Phoenix:
W-what're we going to do, Mia!
Mia:
Well, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine!
Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there!
Mia:
Phoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent?
I believe
Phoenix:
Of course he is!
Mia:
... That's all I wanted to hear. Excellent. I'll see you in court, then.
Leads to:
"Great! Thanks, Mia!"
I don't know
Phoenix:
(I never expected things to go this badly for Powers's case... I'm not sure we can win this one.)
Mia:
Phoenix? If you don't believe him, who will!?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, she's mad.)
Mia:
Oh well... I'll see you in court tomorrow then.
Leads to:
"Great! Thanks, Mia!"
Phoenix:
Great! Thanks, Mia!
Mia:
See you soon.
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
