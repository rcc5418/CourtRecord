October 20, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
Today will be the final day of this trial. I hope both the prosecution and the defense will be able to present decisive evidence. Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening statement.
Edgeworth:
In yesterday's session, the defense presented us with a new theory for this case. He claims that the scene of the crime was, in fact, Studio Two. Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear.
Judge:
Hmm... very well!
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)
Judge:
You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand. Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer who was present in the Studio Two trailer that day.
Edgeworth:
Will the witness state her name and occupation?
Vasquez:
... Dee Vasquez. I am a producer for Global Studios.
Edgeworth:
On the day of the murder, you were in the trailer in Studio Two...
Vasquez:
As everyone here knows, yes?
Edgeworth:
...?
Vasquez:
I dislike needless banter. If you must pontificate, do it when I'm not here.
Edgeworth:
Mrrph!
Judge:
V-very well, Ms. Vasquez. Please give the court your testimony concerning the day of the murder.
Maya:
Nick! I know she did it! Make her pay!
Phoenix:
R-right! (If she's guilty, I'll catch her with her pants down... So to speak.)
Witness Testimony
-- The Day of the Murder --
Vasquez:
I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.
The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00.
There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One...
I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.
At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.
Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.
We found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One.
That's all.
Judge:
Hmm... I have a question about one part of your testimony. You were "fatigued" so you had Sal "take" you...?
Vasquez:
The van.
Judge:
Hmm?
Vasquez:
There's a van at Studio Two. I had him take me in that. I thought it might be risky to walk, what with that monkey's head toppling over.
Van added to the Court Record.
Judge:
I... I see! Very well. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.
Maya:
This is the final battle, Nick! Let's do it!
Cross Examination
-- The Day of the Murder --
Vasquez:
I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
By yourself?
Vasquez:
Yes.
Phoenix:
And you didn't stop in at the Employee Area?
Vasquez:
No.
Phoenix:
... Are you always this... terse?
Vasquez:
Yes.
Phoenix:
(Oh dear...)
Vasquez:
The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00..
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did no one leave during the meeting?
Vasquez:
No one. ...
Phoenix:
... C-come on... let's talk a bit more about that.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The witness did not come here to engage in idle conversation! Stop interrupting the testimony.
Vasquez:
The same could be said to you, Mr. Edgeworth. And please stop banging on your little desk. It hurts my ears.
Edgeworth:
Mmph!
Vasquez:
There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And when exactly was that?
Vasquez:
I've forgotten.
Phoenix:
...
Vasquez:
...
Phoenix:
Maybe you could try remembering?
Vasquez:
No.
Edgeworth:
The meeting ended at 4:00, and the rehearsal was scheduled for 5:00... I would think it was between those times.
Phoenix:
(You "would think"!? C'mon, all you did was state the obvious, Edgeworth!)
Vasquez:
I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Hold on! You had Sal "take" you? What does that mean!?
Vasquez:
It means what I just said. I had Sal take me in the Studio Two van.
Phoenix:
(Oh... oh, right.)
Vasquez:
At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And what were you doing during that time...?
Vasquez:
Don't hit your desk. It irritates me.
Edgeworth:
Yeah! Mr. Wright...! Oops.
Vasquez:
... It was a 15 minute break...
Vasquez:
Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Do you have someone who can verify this?
Vasquez:
Sal.
Phoenix:
N-no... I mean someone else?
Vasquez:
One person is enough.
Phoenix:
(If she committed murder during that break... She wouldn't have had time to eat a t-bone steak! If I had some evidence that proved she didn't eat that steak...)
Present Steak Plate
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Hah! As I thought!"
Maya:
Well, Nick? Find anything?
Phoenix:
I kind of wish she'd said a little more...
Maya:
It's hard. I think she's pretty used to being the boss. But I'm sure you'll find some contradiction in what she said... somewhere!
Phoenix:
Hah! As I thought!
Vasquez:
...
Phoenix:
You claim you ate a t-bone steak! But I say you did not!
Judge:
W-what's this, now, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Look at this.
Judge:
It's... a plate?
Phoenix:
This plate was on the table in the employee room. As you can see, a large bone has been left behind.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. Need I remind you it was a T-BONE STEAK!?
Phoenix:
Exactly my point! Remember if you will... Ms. Vasquez and Mr. Manella ate at a table outside the trailer. Yet there were no bones left on the plates! The plates were bare!
Vasquez:
!
Phoenix:
Ms. Vasquez? Tell me, how can a person eat a t-bone steak... and not leave the bone? I think I know how!
You ate the bone, too
Phoenix:
You ate the bone, too!
Maya:
Um, Nick... are you sure? I mean, I love steak, but even I don’t eat the bone!
Phoenix:
Hey, I don’t eat it either!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! I, too, leave the bone.
Phoenix:
Um, can I try that again?
Leads back to:
"I think I know how!"
You ate a boneless steak
Phoenix:
Elementary! You were eating a boneless steak!
Judge:
... Mr. Wright, say you are right... What would that prove?
Phoenix:
... Um, right, Your Honor.
Maya:
Nick! Remember her testimony? She said she ate a "t-bone steak"! She said "bone"!
Phoenix:
Correct! I was... testing you!
Maya:
Yeah, sure, Nick.
Phoenix:
Sorry... Can I try that one more time?
Judge:
...
Leads back to:
"I think I know how!"
You didn't eat the steak
Leads to:
"You didn't eat any steak during that break!"
Phoenix:
You didn't eat any steak during that break! You took your steak and threw it somewhere... like that incinerator!
Vasquez:
! ...
Judge:
I... I see! Then what was Ms. Vasquez doing during her break?
Phoenix:
Isn’t it obvious, Your Honor?
Meeting the Steel Samurai
Leads to:
"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!"
Picking on Sal Manella
Phoenix:
She was picking on Mr. Manella!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... Sometimes this court finds it hard to tell whether you are joking or being serious.
Phoenix:
Oh...?
Judge:
I would prefer it if you remained serious!
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. I'll do my best.
Leads to:
"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!"
Phoenix:
She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!
Judge:
Order! A-are you saying...!?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor! As Ms. Vasquez left the trailer to eat her steak... She ran into the Steel Samurai! And then you did it. You killed him with your own hands!
Vasquez:
!!!
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! I-isn't that a little presumptuous!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!?
Vasquez:
Let him claim what he wants.... You say I did it?
Phoenix:
Yes.
Vasquez:
Fascinating! And here I was worrying that today would be as boring as all the rest. ... Very well. Let us have a battle of wits, you and I.
Phoenix:
(Any day, Vasquez!)
Maya:
Good luck, Nick!
Vasquez:
Let's see... What was that murder weapon again? Oh yes, the "Samurai Spear."
Phoenix:
Yes...?
Vasquez:
I am, as you can see, a woman of petite stature. How could I possibly use that heavy spear as a weapon?
I think you could!
Phoenix:
It's not impossible!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Well, maybe it's not impossible, but--
Vasquez:
Silence. I'm speaking.
Edgeworth:
Mmmph!
Vasquez:
The victim was stabbed through the chest from the front, yes? I believe this would indicate that the victim was aware of the killer's presence. Now, the Steel Samurai costume is quite light and mobile. Compared to the victim, I am weaker and slower... I couldn't possibly win such a fight! Not to mention, there is proof I did not have the spear! The photograph of the Steel Samurai shows that the victim himself was holding it! Or do you mean to suggest that I could have wrested it away from him?
Edgeworth:
Y-yeah! Take that, Wright! If you still think she did it, show us proof!
Phoenix:
Umm... er...
Maya:
Hey, Nick. Look at the data we have on that Samurai Spear in the Court Record. Isn't there something in there that gets to you...?
Phoenix:
Something odd about the Samurai Spear...? ... Wait!
Judge:
Something the matter, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor. I'd like to take back my previous claim.
Judge:
Very well, I won't hold you to your claim. But I'm afraid I will have to penalize you.
Phoenix:
(Ugh...)
Edgeworth:
What’s this? You're taking back your claim?
Phoenix:
Let's backtrack for a moment. I want to consider whether the witness could have used the Samurai Spear or not!
Leads to:
"However, that has no bearing on this case!"
You couldn't, could you
Phoenix:
I think you would have a great deal of difficulty using that as a weapon. Pretty much anyone would.
Vasquez:
Hah. You see?
Phoenix:
Yes...
Leads to:
"However, that has no bearing on this case!"
I don't know
Phoenix:
I don't know.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You "don't know"!? What kind of a lawyer are you!?
Vasquez:
Quiet. I'm speaking.
Edgeworth:
M-m-mmph!
Vasquez:
You "don't know"!? What kind of a lawyer...
Phoenix:
I don't know whether you could have fought with the Samurai Spear...
Leads to:
"However, that has no bearing on this case!"
Phoenix:
However, that has no bearing on this case!
Vasquez:
... Meaning?
Phoenix:
The Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon!
Vasquez:
What!?
Judge:
What is the meaning of this!? The spear was found lying next to the victim's body!
Phoenix:
I have proof, Your Honor. I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!
Present Samurai Spear
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I present my proof: the so-called "murder weapon"!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Wrong, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
But I haven’t said anything yet...?
Judge:
I know you well enough by now to know when you’re going to present the wrong evidence.
Maya:
I can sense it too, with my Fey blood...
Phoenix:
(Okay, okay, so I picked the wrong evidence! Enough with all the sensing!) Right. Okay, here’s the real evidence, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!"
Phoenix:
I present my proof: the so-called "murder weapon"!
Edgeworth:
B-but, that IS the murder weapon!
Phoenix:
Not so fast. Remember that this spear broke during the morning action scene run-through? But, someone fixed the spear. It was the security lady! She fixed it with duct tape! Now tell me, how is it possible... for someone to stab a man who is wearing a thick costume with this!? Through the chest!
Judge:
O-order! Order!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! What are you driving at!? Think about what you're--
Vasquez:
Silence! I’m the one testifying here and I will be heard!
Edgeworth:
Mmmph...!
Vasquez:
Are you quite sane? Are you even aware of what you're saying? If the Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon, then pray tell what was!? How was Hammer killed?
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?
I can tell you
Leads to:
"Would I make a claim like that if I couldn’t tell you what the weapon was?"
I can't tell you
Phoenix:
Of course I can't.
Judge:
"O-of course"!?
Edgeworth:
Can the antics, Wright!
Judge:
I have to agree, Mr. Wright. At least pretend that you think you might know!
Phoenix:
(Urk. Note to self: think before speaking. Tough crowd...)
Leads back to:
"Well, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?"
Phoenix:
Would I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?
Judge:
I’m afraid your confidence can sometimes be unfounded, Mr. Wright... Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then.
Present Five-Year-Old Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Look at this photo."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Maya:
Nick! Think about this some more!
Phoenix:
Huh? Think?
Maya:
Please! How could that possibly have been the murder weapon!?
Phoenix:
(Hmm. She has a point.)
Judge:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
N-no, Your Honor. Nothing!
Leads back to:
"Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then."
Phoenix:
Look at this photo.
Judge:
W-what is this? Why, that's Jack Hammer standing at the top of the stairs! O-order! Order! If I cannot have order this trial will be suspended! Mr. Wright! What is this all about!?
Phoenix:
This photograph is from five years ago. There was an unfortunate accident at Global Studios. This is a photo of that very accident. Not a word of this was leaked to the outside. It was a close-kept secret at the studios.
Edgeworth:
What does this have to do with the current case!?
Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth... You still can't see it? See the fallen man in this photo? See how the fencepost pierced him through the chest?
Edgeworth:
Wh... what!? Are you saying...!?
Phoenix:
Yes. What happened five years ago... has happened again!
Vasquez:
!!!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Continue!
Phoenix:
It's 2:30 PM on the day of the murder! Ms. Dee Vasquez meets Jack Hammer outside the Studio Two trailer! Then she did it! She pushed Mr. Hammer off the stairs onto the fence! Just like Mr. Hammer had himself done five years ago! Though whether she did it on purpose or by accident, I cannot say.
Vasquez:
...!
Edgeworth:
I-in other words... th-the victim, Mr. Hammer... He died in the same way that he caused another man to die... five years ago!
Phoenix:
Precisely. Ironic, isn’t it?
Vasquez:
... Hoh hoh. Very creative, Mr. Wright. I could use a man like you on my script writing staff.
Phoenix:
You deny that what I say is true?
Vasquez:
... Mr. Wright. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Hammer died at the trailer as you say. Yet the body was found at Studio One, was it not? And in the Evil Magistrate's costume, no less. Are you then claiming that I carried the body to Studio One... And returned to the trailer all in the space of a 15 minute break? How could I have disposed of the body!?
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
The break in the meeting at the trailer lasted 15 minutes, from 2:30 to 2:45. Could Jack Hammer have been pushed off the stairs to his death... then carried to Studio One and placed inside his costume? There wasn’t enough time!
Judge:
Hmm... indeed. Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?
She couldn't deal with it
Phoenix:
15 minutes is kind of a short amount of time...
Vasquez:
You see? Even I cannot do the impossible. Therefore, Mr. Wright. I didn't do it. Agreed?
Phoenix:
Not agreed!
Vasquez:
?
Leads to:
"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?"
I bet she could move it
Phoenix:
You’d be surprised! I bet she could do it! When people think their life depends on it, they can do amazing things!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, this is not an episode of "That's Incredible."
Edgeworth:
If you claim she did everything in 15 minutes...
Phoenix:
(Let me guess: "Show Me Proof!")
Edgeworth:
Correct! Show me proof!
Phoenix:
(How am I supposed to do that...?)
Edgeworth:
Then I won't have you making any unsubstantiated claims!
Phoenix:
(... Wait a second, how does he know what I'm thinking!?)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I need only look at the cold sweat running down your face to know what you're thinking!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Perhaps you’d like to reconsider your claim?
Leads back to:
"Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?"
She had another way
Leads to:
"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?"
Phoenix:
What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?
Vasquez:
For instance?
Phoenix:
Actually, for that matter, there was no need for her to do the deed in 15 minutes! And there was a way for you to carry that body.
Vasquez:
!!! I-interesting! Let's hear it then.
Judge:
Mr. Wright? Please show us how she carried the body.
Present Van
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ms. Vasquez."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Dee Vasquez used this to carry the body to Studio One!
Vasquez:
...
Judge:
Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
Your Honor?
Judge:
Mr. Wright, how can you carry a dead body with that?
Phoenix:
Umm...
Judge:
Please rethink your statement.
Leads back to:
"Please show us how she carried the body."
Phoenix:
Ms. Vasquez. You carried the body to Studio One. And you used the studio van to do it!
Vasquez:
!!!
Phoenix:
Recall your testimony...
Vasquez:
There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One. I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me. There was a van there, right? I had Sal drive me.
Phoenix:
You used the van to carry the body to Studio One! Then, before everyone else got there, you put the body into the Magistrate costume!
Vasquez:
...!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hold on, Wright! Don't forget, it was Sal Manella that drove the van! Are you suggesting that Mr. Manella was a conspirator?
Of course he was
Leads to:
"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!"
Of course he wasn't
Phoenix:
Of course he wasn't!
Edgeworth:
Hah! So, without Mr. Manella noticing anything, she put the body in the van... Then managed to put the body into the costume...? Are you seriously suggesting that is possible!?
Phoenix:
... Of course I'm not serious.
Edgeworth:
Ha... hah!?
Phoenix:
I was kidding. To, er, lighten up the proceedings.
Edgeworth:
Li..light... Lighten!? Y-you can't lighten up a murder!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. The court requests you refrain from making claims in jest.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Leads to:
"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!"
Phoenix:
Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator! The body had to be placed in the van, and put into the costume. There's no way Ms. Vasquez could have done that alone! Also, don't forget that they had to dispose of the Steel Samurai costume. They had to... because it was covered in Mr. Hammer's blood! They probably burned it in that small incinerator. Well, Ms. Vasquez! Shall I continue?
Vasquez:
... No need. You're smarter than you look, Mr. Wright. Hmph. I lose. You win. It... was fun.
Phoenix:
(I... win!?) ...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
...
...
Phoenix:
Umm... So... what happens next?
Vasquez:
?
Phoenix:
Don't "?" me! Don’t you have anything to say!?
Vasquez:
What would you like me to say?
Phoenix:
Huh? "I lost"? Something like that!
Vasquez:
I just said that.
Phoenix:
W-wait, so you mean... Dee Vasquez! So, it was you? You killed Jack Hammer! ...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
...
...
Vasquez:
Who can say?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Vasquez:
Are you sure I did? Mr. Wright... We just engaged in a battle of wits. And the result of that battle? You proved the possibility that I murdered Hammer.
Phoenix:
R-right!
Vasquez:
But... that is only a possibility. Proof is another thing altogether. You lack decisive proof, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Wha... wha... wha... wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT!?
Judge:
Order! Mr. Edgeworth, your thoughts?
Edgeworth:
Umm... uhh... mmmph. O-of course, it's as the witness says! ... Certainly, it does seem very likely she did it... but, uh, there's no proof!
Phoenix:
(...! Edgeworth isn't sure!)
Vasquez:
... Well? I came here as a witness today. If you've no more questions, I'll be leaving.
Phoenix:
(Urk! What do I do now!?)
You did it, Vasquez!
Phoenix:
Ms. Vasquez! You did it!
Vasquez:
... That wasn't a question.
Phoenix:
... Um, did you do it?
Vasquez:
No.
Judge:
Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
I'm not sure that question helped this court get any closer to a verdict.
Leads back to:
"(Urk! What do I do now!?)"
Testify again, Vasquez!
Phoenix:
I... I'd like you to testify again!
Judge:
Testify... again?
Vasquez:
Know when to give up, Mr. Wright. Think about it. Even if I were to testify again, what's the point? I can only say what I said before. The truth, Mr. Wright. I've already said all there is to say. What would happen if I said it again?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Vasquez:
You'd ask the same questions, get the same answers. A waste of time.
Leads to:
"(Damn... damn!)"
No further questions, Vasquez!
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I was hoping I'd come up with a question while pounding on my desk. I didn't.
Judge:
... You have my sympathies.
Leads to:
"(Damn... damn!)"
Phoenix:
(Damn... damn! To come so far, only to fail...)
Judge:
As it seems there are no further questions... I would like to end the cross-examination of the witness, Ms. Vasquez.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I was hoping I'd come up with a question while I was objecting, Your Honor... I didn't.
Judge:
I see... Very well.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! I request that the witness testify again!
Vasquez:
You are the prosecutor, are you not? Why are you badgering me? I'm your witness!
Edgeworth:
I... I just want to hear your testimony again.
Vasquez:
Does this make any sense to you, Your Honor? I don't see that we have anything to gain by repeating the last several minutes.
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... I, too, see little point in making Ms. Vasquez repeat herself. What exactly did you want her to testify about?
Edgeworth:
Mmmph! Well, yes, um... ... Indeed! Verily, I say... Ergo! I want to hear about what happened... after they found the body!
Judge:
After they found the body...? Very well. The witness will testify to the court concerning this matter.
Vasquez:
Hmph.
Maya:
Nick! Why did Edgeworth...?
Phoenix:
Who knows? He probably realized she did it, too.
Maya:
But... but! Wasn't he the one that said he always gets a guilty verdict...? After all that...
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth...)
Witness Testimony
-- After Finding the Body --
Vasquez:
I was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body.
The assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent.
I immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up.
The security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying "he did it!"
I asked to be left out of the proceedings.
I went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes.
Then I went home.
Judge:
Hmm... I see no issues raised by this testimony... Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.
Maya:
Okay, Nick, we're close, real close! She may be acting tough now... But if you put her on the spot she's sure to falter! Find the key you need and twist the truth out of her, Nick!
Phoenix:
Right!
Cross Examination
-- After Finding the Body --
Vasquez:
I was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What time was that?
Vasquez:
We were to meet at 5:00 for the rehearsal. So I'd say it was then.
Phoenix:
When exactly did you and Mr. Manella arrive at the studio?
Vasquez:
About 10 minutes before. I wasn't stuffing any bodies into costumes, mind you.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Press harder
Phoenix:
Where were the other employees when you got to the studio?
Vasquez:
They weren't there yet.
Phoenix:
Well!? Then you could have put Hammer in that costume, with Sal Manella's help!
Vasquez:
Oh? What did I just say? Did I not just say "I wasn't stuffing any bodies into any costumes"...? You should try to listen to what people are saying, boy.
Phoenix:
(B-boy!?)
Judge:
The witness will continue her testimony.
Hold back
Phoenix:
(I'd better leave this one be. I'm sure she'd see through anything I had to throw at her, anyway.)
Vasquez:
The assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers was taking a nap, correct?
Vasquez:
So he says.
Phoenix:
Did no one go to call him?
Vasquez:
Remember...
Phoenix:
Remember... what?
Vasquez:
There was a dead body lying in front of us. Yet you expect me to be calm?
Phoenix:
(You certainly seemed calm enough when I accused you of murder! *sigh*)
Press harder
Phoenix:
Wait a second! Wouldn't that be the other way around!?
Vasquez:
The other way around?
Phoenix:
You discovered a murdered body, and one person was missing, right? Wouldn't you normally go looking for the missing person!?
Judge:
Hmm... I have to agree with the defense on this one. Well, Ms. Vasquez?
Vasquez:
Hmph. Logically speaking, perhaps. But no one there was thinking very logically, I assure you. Also. Without his Steel Samurai costume, Powers doesn't really stand out. We often left him on the bus when shooting at location. No one noticed he was missing.
Phoenix:
(Poor Powers...)
Judge:
Hmm... Well, I suppose that explains that. Very well, Ms. Vasquez. You may continue.
Back off
Phoenix:
(I'll hold off. She'd just blow off anything I had to say, anyway.)
Vasquez:
I immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What was everyone else doing at that time?
Vasquez:
No one said a thing. It was silent. Completely silent. So we stood there until Powers finally arrived on the scene. "Sorry! Sorry I'm late!" Then... silence. Dead silence.
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
...
...
Vasquez:
Silent.
Maya:
Hey... Hey, Nick. Why's everyone so quiet? Someone should do something to lighten things up!
Vasquez:
The security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying "he did it!"
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
(Oldbag... the security lady.) Why did the security lady think Powers had done it?
Vasquez:
She said because she saw him going toward the studio.
Phoenix:
(Right... the Steel Samurai.)
Press harder
Phoenix:
Did the detective arrest Mr. Powers based solely on the security lady's word?
Vasquez:
Perhaps not. She seems to have given the detective that photograph... Of course, I heard all this after the fact.
Phoenix:
(That photograph... meaning the one taken by the security camera.)
Vasquez:
She's not known for exhibiting the best sense of judgment when it comes to Hammer.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. I don't think there's anything in there I can use.)
Back off
Phoenix:
(I'll hold back, I think. I'm sure she's already anticipated anything I could throw at her.)
Vasquez:
I asked to be left out of the proceedings.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You "asked to be left out"?
Vasquez:
Yes. It seems that everyone else was questioned. And I'm really not fond of that sort of thing.
Phoenix:
But, you can't decide who the police will and won't question!
Vasquez:
Thankfully, the studio thinks otherwise. They were nice enough to understand that, since we were in a meeting... There was no way we could be involved. Thus, they covered for us.
Phoenix:
(Covered for you... or covered it up for you? There must have been a lot riding on it, with all those bigwigs at the meeting... I'm sure her "professionals" helped convince everyone they didn't require questioning.)
Vasquez:
I went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The script and your direction notes?
Vasquez:
Yes, they're quite valuable. It wouldn't do to have them stolen.
Phoenix:
No, I guess not.
Press harder
Phoenix:
Wait a second! I thought you came to Studio One for a rehearsal! Why didn't you bring your script and notes!?
Vasquez:
Well, I was under the impression that we wouldn't be able to rehearse anything.
Phoenix:
Why?
Vasquez:
There was a murder, after all! Who could think of rehearsing after that!
Phoenix:
(Oh, yeah, I guess...)
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Ms. Vasquez, please continue...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor!!! I have an objection to the witness's last statement!
Phoenix:
(Huh...!?)
Edgeworth:
Think! Ms. Vasquez said she didn't bring the script because there wouldn't be a rehearsal. Don't you see what that means? She would have had to know about the murder before going to Studio One!
Vasquez:
...!
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
What you have just said... is a reasonable observation. However, I find it hard to understand why the prosecution would make such a move! Or are you thinking of a career change to defense!?
Edgeworth:
... I... appreciate the concern, Your Honor. I will stand by my statement, however, regardless of how the court sees my role here. Now, Ms. Vasquez... Do you have an explanation?
Phoenix:
(I can't believe Edgeworth is helping me!)
Vasquez:
Hmph. So the prosecution is in cahoots with the defense? What kind of court is this? No matter. I think you misunderstood me. I had a perfectly good reason to believe there would be no rehearsal.
Judge:
Hmm... Very well, the witness will change her testimony to reflect this reason.
Change statement:
"Then I went home." to "I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind."
Back off
Phoenix:
(I'll hold back, I think. I'm sure she's already anticipated anything I could throw at her.)
Vasquez:
Then I went home.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you weren't questioned?
Vasquez:
That's correct. I find these things... distasteful.
Press harder
Phoenix:
Thinking back to when we first began this trial... We were under the impression that there was no one in the trailer at all.
Vasquez:
I suppose.
Phoenix:
Why is that?
Vasquez:
Well, we were in a meeting the whole afternoon. What's the point of talking about that to the police?
Phoenix:
(She has got to be the least guilt-ridden guilty person I've ever met...)
Back off
Phoenix:
(I'll hold back for now. I'm sure she's anticipated anything I had to say...)
Vasquez:
I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How did you know about the injury?
Vasquez:
H-how did I know!? Sal. He told me.
Phoenix:
(Sal the director... Hm...)
Present Powers's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"You "knew that Hammer was injured"...?"
Maya:
You have to find something to peg this on her here... Or everything we've done till now will have been wasted! I believe in you, Nick! Go get 'em!
Phoenix:
You "knew that Hammer was injured"...? Don't you think that's a little funny? I mean, it was the Steel Samurai who was injured! It was Will Powers!
Vasquez:
Wh... what!?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!
Phoenix:
Yes, Mr. Hammer is dragging his leg in this photo. But that's because he was pretending to be Mr. Powers!
Vasquez:
P-pretending...?
Phoenix:
One person was inured in the run-through that morning. That person was Mr. Powers, not Mr. Hammer! Now, why did you think it was Mr. Hammer who was injured?
Vasquez:
...! I-I already said it was Sal who told me! Th-that's right! He must have gotten it wrong.
Phoenix:
I think not. Mr. Manella was at the run-through that morning. He would have known it was Mr. Powers who was injured. He saw it happen! Why would he tell you the wrong person? Ms. Vasquez!
You heard Mr. Manella wrong
Phoenix:
You must have heard Mr. Manella wrong! Even though he said Mr. Powers was injured... You thought he was talking about Mr. Hammer!
Vasquez:
... Now that you mention it... Yes, I believe you're right. I'm sure that's what happened.
Phoenix:
Yeah! ...
Maya:
Nick! You're supposed to be putting her on the spot, not helping her out!
Phoenix:
Oh, right... I kind of talked myself out of that one, didn't I?
Maya:
Quick! Start over!
Leads back to:
"Ms. Vasquez!"
You saw Hammer limping
Leads to:
"Actually, you didn't hear anything from Mr. Manella."
Phoenix:
Actually, you didn't hear anything from Mr. Manella. You saw Mr. Hammer limping with your own eyes!
Judge:
Yes, but... Wasn't it Mr. Powers who was injured...?
Phoenix:
Yes, but remember! Mr. Hammer was dragging his leg, too! He was pretending to be Mr. Powers!
Judge:
Aah!
Phoenix:
And when was he doing this...?
Edgeworth:
Well... It would have been after he put on the Steel Samurai costume... and went to Studio Two. Where he was murdered!
Phoenix:
Exactly! Ms. Vasquez! You met him, didn't you? You saw the Steel Samurai limping! And Mr. Hammer was in that Steel Samurai suit! That's why you were confused! That's why you thought it was Mr. Hammer who had been injured that morning!
Vasquez:
...!!!
Judge:
Order! Order! I will have order!
Edgeworth:
Witness! Can you refute this claim?
Vasquez:
Hrrmmmm... hmph! ... ...
Phoenix:
(Yeah, let's see you sneak out of this one, Vasquez!)
Vasquez:
... Very well! I have a question for you!
Phoenix:
(Urk... Why are the real killers always so... persistent?)
Vasquez:
Why in the world would I want Mr. Hammer dead? Yes, he'd fallen on hard times, but he was a star! I had nothing to gain from his death! Nothing!
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, you would need a motive. Why would she have killed the victim? If there is a reason, it is unclear to this court. Does the defense have anything to say on the matter? In other words, can you prove she had a motive?
Of course I can prove it!
Leads to:
"Okay."
Of course I can't prove it!
Maya:
Nick, no! Saying you can't prove it now would be admitting defeat! She'll get away!
Phoenix:
But... but what proof could I possibly have!?
Maya:
I don't care if it's impossible, you still have to fight this one!
Phoenix:
Ugh...
Leads to:
"Okay."
Phoenix:
Okay. I have proof, and I'll show it to you! I present to the court evidence as to Ms. Vasquez's motive in this murder.
Present Five-Year-Old Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is my proof!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Psst, Maya, look. This is it.
Maya:
...! Why... are you showing that to me, Nick? And why are you whispering?
Phoenix:
I was just testing it out on you.
Maya:
Huh. Well, I'm afraid your test results are negative.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor!
Judge:
Hurry up with it! We have a certain tempo we have to maintain here!
Phoenix:
Yes... yes, Your Honor. Right. Here goes!
Leads back to:
"I present to the court evidence as to Ms. Vasquez’s motive in this murder."
Phoenix:
This is my proof!
Judge:
This is... the photo from before?
Phoenix:
This photo reveals the motive in this murder!
Vasquez:
...!
Phoenix:
I'm right, aren't I, Ms. Vasquez?
Vasquez:
Hrrrrrrm... hmph!
Phoenix:
Five years ago, Mr. Hammer was at the height of his fame. With Dee Vasquez's help, a terrible accident was swept under the carpet... Ladies and gentlemen, the case currently up for trial... It began on that day, five years ago!
Vasquez:
...
Phoenix:
Ironically enough, that accident precipitated Mr. Hammer's fall... His fall from stardom!
Edgeworth:
His guilt weighed him down, no doubt.
Phoenix:
However! You, Dee Vasquez, used Mr. Hammer. You made him work for you for petty change!
Vasquez:
Hmph!
Edgeworth:
Bringing us to the present day... and Mr. Hammer's last role as the Evil Magistrate!
Phoenix:
Yes! Undoubtedly, it was a constant source of shame for the ex-star...
Edgeworth:
Hmm...
Judge:
One moment, Mr. Wright. We are talking about motives, here... yet you have only talked about Mr. Hammer. It almost seems as if... As if it was Mr. Hammer who had killed Dee Vasquez, not the other way around! What motive would Ms. Vasquez have?
Vasquez:
Y-yes, that's right. According to what you say... I would have no reason to kill Hammer. He was a good source of income for me! And I never get rid of useful men. It's a policy of mine.
Judge:
Mr. Wright? Please explain Ms. Vasquez's motive for murder.
Reveal evidence
Phoenix:
Okay... Allow me to present to the court evidence proving Ms. Vasquez's motive!
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is my proof!"
Phoenix:
This is my proof!
Judge:
And... this tells us why Ms. Vasquez wanted to kill Mr. Hammer?
Vasquez:
I’d say all it proves is that the defense attorney has completely lost his marbles.
Phoenix:
(Urk!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! The court requests that you find your marbles immediately. And, I'm afraid I have to penalize your [sic] for this waste of the court's time.
Maya:
Nick! We’re so close! Think this one through, please!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, I'll ask you again.
Leads back to:
"Please explain Ms. Vasquez's motive for murder."
She had no motive
Leads to:
"She had no motive, Your Honor."
Phoenix:
She had no motive, Your Honor.
Judge:
What's that now!?
Phoenix:
It was Mr. Hammer who was out for blood! All Ms. Vasquez did was push him off the stairs... in self defense!
Edgeworth:
What's that now!?
Phoenix:
It's simple! Mr. Hammer was intending to kill Ms. Vasquez!
Edgeworth:
Wha-!? WHAT!?
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Jack Hammer drugged Mr. Powers with sleeping pills! Jack Hammer snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume! Jack Hammer wore the costume to fool the security lady into thinking he was Powers! Then Jack Hammer made his way to the trailer! And for what purpose, you ask? To kill Dee Vasquez, who had so cruelly taken advantage of him all those years!
Phoenix:
So, you did do it, didn't you?
Vasquez:
... Yes. I am guilty. It was me...
"Someone call an ambulance!"
"Th-there's blood everywhere! We're too late!"
"Aah! Ms. Vasquez!"
"What...? What happened here!?"
"Manuel fell from the trailer stairs...!"
"Manuel! Manuel!"
"Ms. Vasquez, please, try to remain calm..."
"No...! No! How could this...?"
"It was an accident..."
"Mr. Hammer was doing an action scene and..."
"No! Manuel! Manuel!!!"
"D-don't touch him! Ms. Vasquez!"
"Nooooooooooooo!"
"Please... please don't die."
"Please..."
Vasquez:
Congratulations, Mr. Wright. I lose... again.
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... Where's Dee Vasquez?
Edgeworth:
In the waiting lobby, Your Honor. As calm and collected as ever...
Judge:
I see... Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
It appears you have brought about yet another miracle.
Phoenix:
I... thank you, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
I think not, Your Honor. Will Powers was innocent. That he should be found so is only natural... not a miracle.
Judge:
... Yes. Yes, you're right. Very well. This court finds the defendant, Mr. Will Powers...
Not Guilty
Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned!

Will:
I... I don’t know what to say! Thank you so much!
Phoenix:
I’m just glad you’re okay.
Will:
Yes... but... it's sad. I know now that Mr. Hammer stole my costume. It's bad enough that he wanted to kill Ms. Vasquez... But to think that he tried to frame me for the murder! It makes me sad... Tell me why, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
H-huh?
Will:
Tell me! Why did Mr. Hammer want to blame me...?
I don't know
Phoenix:
I guess we'll never know.
Will:
Y-yes, of course.
Phoenix:
(Whew... I'm not sure I wanted to go down that road.)
Leads to:
"Congratulations, WP!"
Show evidence
Phoenix:
Well, this is what I think. Mr. Hammer wanted to put the blame on you because...
Present "Path to Glory" OR Power's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
It's because you were the Steel Samurai.
Will:
Because I was the Steel Samurai?
Phoenix:
Mr. Hammer was a big star, once. But he was reduced to acting in a kids' show... and as the villain, to boot! The kids love the Steel Samurai. And so, he hated you.
Will:
I... I think I understand. H-he could have just told me. I would have changed places with him any time!
Phoenix:
(I think you’re missing the point...)
Will:
... Thank you. I'm just glad it's all over.
Phoenix:
(So am I... so am I...)
Leads to:
"Congratulations, WP!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Will:
... S-sorry? What does that mean?
Phoenix:
Yeah, what does that mean, Maya?
Maya:
Um, Nick? You know that problem of yours? That problem where you present evidence that makes no sense? You're doing it again.
Phoenix:
(Oh...)
Will:
...?
Leads to:
"Congratulations, WP!"
Maya:
Congratulations, WP!
Will:
Oh? Oh! Heh heh. Thanks to you, I'll be able to don the Steel Samurai outfit once more! I can't wait to get back into that sweaty costume and... ...? Is... something wrong?
Maya:
N-no! O-of course not... Aah! N-Nick! Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
... Say something, Wright. I'm not good at small talk.
Phoenix:
Huh? What? ... Umm... that was too bad, Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
You don't waste any time gloating, do you?
Phoenix:
No... I really wanted to thank you. Vasquez would have gotten away if you hadn't stepped in.
Will:
Ah, uh, pleased to meet you. I'm Powers. *sniff*
Edgeworth:
Ah, er, Edgeworth. I'm a big fan of your work, Mr. Powers.
Phoenix:
(Liar!)
Edgeworth:
... Wright. I must say, I hadn't expected to meet you again after all these years.
Maya:
Meet "again"...?
Edgeworth:
However. In retrospect, it would have been better had we not met. Thanks to you, I am saddled with unnecessary... feelings.
Phoenix:
Unnecessary feelings?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Unease... and uncertainty.
Phoenix:
Aren’t those kind of necessary?
Edgeworth:
They only serve to get in my way. You listen to me, Phoenix Wright. Don't ever show your face in front of me again. That's what I came here to tell you.
Will:
Umm... Mr. Wright? Is... this guy your friend?
Maya:
What? Friends? As if! They’re rivals! Rivals! Right, Nick?
Phoenix:
For now we are... I guess.
Maya:
Huh!? Why do I get the feeling I'm missing something? C'mon, Nick! Tell me! What’s the deal with you and Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
And so the curtain closes on another trial... I caused quite a stir by revealing that accident from five years ago. It was the talk of the town. Thankfully, Global Studios rethought its programming change. They went back to making kids' shows again.
Maya:
Nick! This is it! The new show starts today! You're going to watch it with me, right?
Phoenix:
(I'll admit, I was kind of surprised... I didn't think they'd seriously go through with it...)
Maya:
You have to buy trading cards too, okay! We have to trade with Cody and that assistant!
Phoenix:
Fine, fine. I'll do it.
Maya:
Isn't it great that WP gets to play the lead again? I wonder if they'll show his real face this time...
Phoenix:
I dunno... I don't think the world is ready for the real Will Powers...
THE END
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh...)
Judge:
This court finds the defendant, Mr. Will Powers...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over
