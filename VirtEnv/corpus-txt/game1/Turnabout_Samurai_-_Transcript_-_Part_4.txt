Will:
... ... Umm... Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes?
Will:
Why do you look so... unhappy?
Phoenix:
O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)
Mia:
Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.
Phoenix:
This is no time for dead-people jokes, please.
Mia:
You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.
Phoenix:
Something "overlooked"...?
Mia:
We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.
Phoenix:
(This isn't going to be easy.)
October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4
Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.
Edgeworth:
An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios! Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.
Judge:
Very well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
(I wonder if that producer is going to come out...)
Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.
Phoenix:
(... or that director.)
Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and profession?
Manella:
... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL!
Edgeworth:
...
Manella:
S... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.
Judge:
Were you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?
Manella:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.
Mia:
Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!
Phoenix:
R-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)
Witness Testimony
-- The Day of the Murder --
Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.
Manella:
That's about it.
Judge:
Hmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Cross Examination
-- The Day of the Murder --
Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Is that when you always come in to work?
Manella:
Oh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the "industry" way.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your "industry"...)
Manella:
Still, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day.&#160;:(
Edgeworth:
Tell us more about that.
Manella:
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
In the Employee Area?
Manella:
That's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate.
Phoenix:
Was anyone else at the run-through?
Manella:
Oh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it.
Phoenix:
(She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else?
Manella:
Nope, just us four.
Manella:
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why did it go on so long?
Manella:
Um, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see...
Phoenix:
(Oh, right, thus the limp.)
Manella:
Which of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS!
Phoenix:
(ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?)
Manella:
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What exactly did they have for lunch?
Manella:
T-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.)
Edgeworth:
"Everyone else" meaning that the witness did not eat with them.
Manella:
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, in the end, you didn't get to eat?
Manella:
Yeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it?
Phoenix:
That must have been tough.
Mia:
Phoenix.
Phoenix:
Yeah?
Mia:
Doesn't something about that seem odd to you?
Not at all
Phoenix:
Well, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.
Mia:
Oh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.
It's a little vague
Phoenix:
Actually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said "steak, at least." So you ate something other than steak?
Manella:
Yeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation!
Phoenix:
I see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)
It's contradictory
Phoenix:
Yeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!
Manella:
H-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*
Phoenix:
When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table. There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area. Who ate lunch there?
Manella:
M-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all.
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, you mean?
Manella:
Yeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later.
Phoenix:
(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?
Manella:
We took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*
Phoenix:
(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)
Manella:
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What were you discussing?
Manella:
The Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, "Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children." Can j00 believe it!?
Phoenix:
(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?
Manella:
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You didn't take a single break?
Manella:
Er... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*
Phoenix:
(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea...)
Before pressing 5th statement and selecting 'It's contradictory'
Phoenix:
(I'll wait for one to come up and hit him with it later.)
After pressing 5th statement and selecting 'It's contradictory'
Phoenix:
(Wait a second... Maybe I do have an idea!)
Press harder
Leads to:
"Wait a second!"
Leave him be
Phoenix:
(No, on second thought, I'm drawing a blank. If I press too hard in the wrong place, I'll just end up scaring him into silence. Maybe I'll just sit back and see what happens.)
Mia:
Phoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!
Phoenix:
R-right!
Phoenix:
Wait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?
Manella:
Oops! ROFL!
Phoenix:
Well?
Manella:
Umm...
Judge:
Mr. Manella, what's this all about?
Manella:
W-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.
Mia:
Phoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.
Manella:
Urk!
Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh...
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)
Witness Testimony
-- The Break --
Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!
But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*
Judge:
Hmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- The Break --
Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What time exactly did you take this break?
Manella:
Hmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so untl 2:45.
Phoenix:
(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)
Edgeworth:
...
Manella:
But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What were you doing for those 15 minutes?
Manella:
Eating my t-bone steak! What else!?
Phoenix:
There were two plates on the trailer table...?
Manella:
Oh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate.
Phoenix:
(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)
Edgeworth:
To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.
Manella:
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why is that?
After pressing 1st statement
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning?"
Manella:
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.
Manella:
Well, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOL
Mia:
Well, Phoenix?
Phoenix:
That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!
Mia:
All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!
Phoenix:
(Oh, great. Is that all...)
Edgeworth:
Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!
Phoenix:
What!?
Edgeworth:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?
Mia:
Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!
Judge:
Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?
I claim it, and claim it loud
Phoenix:
(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose you might say that...
Phoenix:
(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)
Edgeworth:
Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
What's your point, Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.
Phoenix:
The Court Record...?
Edgeworth:
Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!
Phoenix:
Whoa! You're right!
Edgeworth:
True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Judge:
No counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."
No, it's impossible.
Phoenix:
(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.
Edgeworth:
Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."
Edgeworth:
I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.
Phoenix:
(Wh-what? It's over?)
Judge:
Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.
Judge:
Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!
Judge:
Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!

Mia:
...
Phoenix:
What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...
Mia:
... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.
Phoenix:
M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?
Mia:
... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.
Will:
Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!
Mia:
Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.
Will:
I... You... Thanks. *sniff*
Mia:
Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!
October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4
Judge:
Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!
Phoenix:
(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)
Edgeworth:
However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?
Judge:
Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.
Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and grade in school.
Cody:
...
Edgeworth:
Witness!
Cody:
What!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!
Edgeworth:
Mrph...
Mia:
Cody? Answer his question, okay?
Cody:
H-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!
Phoenix:
(I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.
Edgeworth:
M-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.
Phoenix:
(He's having trouble with this "gentle" thing.)
Edgeworth:
You were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?
Cody:
You got a problem with that!?
Edgeworth:
Please tell us what you saw that day.
Cody:
What, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?
Edgeworth:
Just.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.
Judge:
I prefer "bearded gentleman" myself.
Phoenix:
(A very long day...)
Judge:
Incidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.
Edgeworth:
M-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.
Phoenix:
Wait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?
Cody:
Hey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!
Mia:
Phoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.
Cody's Camera added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Very well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
Cody:
I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.
I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.
I went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.
I was going for the studio.
I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.
When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!
It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!
Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!
If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.
Cody:
Anyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.
Cody:
...
Phoenix:
(This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...)

Phoenix:
You really like the Steel Samurai, huh?
Cody:
Course I do! I've taped every show! And I go to all the live performances!
Phoenix:
That's impressive. Have you been to the amusement park?
Cody:
Course! Duh! My Dad always takes me!
Phoenix:
(Poor, poor Dad...)
Cody:
I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Was that day the first time you'd been to the studio?
Cody:
Uh, actually I've been a couple of times. I never manage to get there on a rehearsal day! And that security lady's always yelling...
Edgeworth:
Right, right. Please continue.
Cody:
Chill, pops! I'm getting to it! How am I supposed to talk with you cuttin' me off all the time? Geez!
Edgeworth:
...
Cody:
I went through the woods, off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Off the path"...?
Cody:
Yeah, you know how the studios are in a valley there? If you go off the path a little, there's woods. That's where I was!
Phoenix:
I see.
Cody:
Anyhow...
Cody:
I was going for the studio.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did nothing unusual happen on your way to the studio?
Cody:
"Unusual"?
Phoenix:
Did you see this monkey by any chance?
Cody:
Oh, you mean Mr. Monkey? Yeah I saw him, but his head wasn't busted!
Edgeworth:
So you went straight to the studio?
Cody:
I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You got lost in the woods?
Cody:
Yeah. I couldn't figure out which way I was walking. Man, was I relieved when I saw the blue studio doors. But guess what happened next!
Cody:
When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai?
Cody:
Yeah, he was standing by the studio gate. It looked like he was thinking about something before going in. Then he opened up the gate and went inside.
Phoenix:
I see. What then?
Cody:
It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What sort of "bad guy" was it?
Cody:
A guy. A person. Kinda tall. Skinny.
Phoenix:
Are you sure it was a guy?
Cody:
... I dunno. He was kinda far away.
Phoenix:
(Huh, he's being awfully vague...)
Mia:
...
Cody:
Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What happened to the bad guy?
Cody:
Huh? Well... Well, he kinda didn't move. Not a bit. Like he was dead. I-I guess he's a real pro! What a great actor!
Phoenix:
Y-yes, I suppose he was.
Cody:
If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"If" you had your camera? You mean, you weren't carrying your camera then?
Cody:
N-no, I wasn't. I-it's not like I have it all the time!
Phoenix:
(Really...?)
Present Cody's Camera
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange."
Phoenix:
(I guess seeing the killing freaked him out and he went home...)
Mia:
Phoenix. Remember, he's a child. Use gentle words... but be firm.
Phoenix:
(Easy for you to say...)
Phoenix:
Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange. Didn't you say before that you always bring your digital camera wherever you go? You were quite clear about that.
Cody:
Huh!?
Phoenix:
Cody, you shouldn't lie here. You understand that, right?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! A word with you...
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... was I putting the pressure on too much?)
Judge:
What is this "digital" camera contraption you're talking about?
Phoenix:
It's umm... a digital camera, Your Honor. It's kind of a new sort of camera. (How do I explain that!?)
Judge:
I see.
Phoenix:
Anyway, Cody... I can't believe you wouldn't bring your camera on a trip to the studios! You did bring it, didn't you?
Cody:
Umm...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! How cruel you are, to terrorize a poor child so!
Phoenix:
I don't care if he's a child or a prosecuting attorney! No one should lie in court!
Edgeworth:
What do you mean "or a prosecuting attorney"!?
Phoenix:
Well, Cody?
Cody:
Wh-what! Yeah, so I had my camera. So what!? You got a problem with that!?
Judge:
So, you did have a camera? And did you use this camera?
Cody:
W-why would I use it? I... I was too busy watching.
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about what you were so busy watching.
Witness Testimony

Cody:
Y-yeah, I had my camera with me.
But I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!
The Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!
Then... then the bad guy stopped moving!
He's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules!

Hmm... Ah? Is that all? Well, that was brief. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.

Okay, then tell us exactly what happened.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So the bad guy attacked him first?
Cody:
Yeah!
Phoenix:
What sort of person was this "bad guy"?
Cody:
I told you, a person. He was a person.
Phoenix:
How was he dressed?
Cody:
... I kinda don't remember. I was too busy watching the Steel Samurai!
Edgeworth:
I see. And what happened next?
Cody:
Then... then the bad guy stopped moving!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why?
Cody:
Huh? Whaddya mean, "why"?
Phoenix:
Why wasn't the bad guy moving?
Cody:
W-well 'cause the Steel Samurai brought him to justice!
Phoenix:
And how exactly did he do that?
Cody:
H-how did he do it? With a Samurai Kick! And a Samurai Punch! Samurai Chop! ... Samurai Slap! S-something like that.
Phoenix:
(He's still being vague about this...)
Cody:
What! Don't give me that look, pops!
Phoenix:
(How should I play this?)
Wait and see what happens
Phoenix:
(Yeah... If I press too hard now, the judge might keep me from continuing. I'll sit back and see how the rest of this goes.)
Press him harder

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What did you do after the bad guy fell, Cody?
Cody:
... Um, actually... The fight was so... so intense that I got kinda scared. So I went straight home.
Phoenix:
(Something isn't adding up here...)
Phoenix:
(Something about his account doesn't seem right...)
Mia:
Phoenix. It doesn't seem right because he's being deliberately vague! Press him on the facts, Phoenix! Find out what he saw!
Phoenix:
Cody.
Cody:
Wh-what!?
Phoenix:
Something's bothering me. Before you said that you "couldn't take your eyes off" the action.
Cody:
Y-yeah? So what?
Phoenix:
Yet you missed the most important part!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
What is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You know as well as I do that he's being vague! Tell me, what kind of murderer uses a "Samurai Slap"!?
Edgeworth:
M-mmph!
Phoenix:
My point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow!
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital?
Phoenix:
Um, well... er, that's the thing...
Mia:
Phoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?
He couldn't watch it
Phoenix:
Because he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Just a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched!
Phoenix:
Umm... huh.
Judge:
I have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation?
Leads back to:
"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai..."
He was watching something else
Phoenix:
He missed the climax of the fight... because he was looking at something else! Probably!
Edgeworth:
"Probably"?
Judge:
"Something else"?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright, explain yourself! What could possibly distract this boy from seeing his idol, the Steel Samurai, fight!? What do you claim he was looking at?
Phoenix:
O-ooof! (C'mon, think of something... think of something... Nothing.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please refrain from making baseless claims!
Phoenix:
Y-yes... Sorry, Your Honor.
Judge:
Do you have another explanation for this?
Leads back to:
"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai..."
Show evidence
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I have evidence."
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I have evidence.
Judge:
"Evidence"...?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. Why did Cody look away from the fight?
Present Cody's Camera
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Here's my proof!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Here's my proof!
Judge:
Proof?
Phoenix:
Um, uh... Can I... do that again? (This doesn't prove anything...!)
Edgeworth:
Hah! Lost your nerve, have you?
Judge:
Very well... I'll ask you the question again.
Leads back to:
"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai..."
Phoenix:
Here's my proof!
Judge:
What's that? The camera...?
Phoenix:
The witness stated that he recently received this camera.
Judge:
Yes, I'm aware of that.
Phoenix:
He wasn't entirely familiar with its operation.
Judge:
I'm aware of that, too. Ah!
Phoenix:
Correct! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture!
Cody:
Hey!
Phoenix:
Bullseye!
Cody:
W-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!?
Phoenix:
(Pressing, not picking...)
Mia:
Good job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!
Phoenix:
Right! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?
Cody:
... ... ... Yeah.
Mia:
Well, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!
Phoenix:
R-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.
Judge:
V-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?
Cody:
Umm...
Phoenix:
(Welcome to the real world, kid!)
Witness Testimony
-- No Photo? --
Cody:
Yeah, you're right, pops.
The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.
So I held up my camera to take a picture!
But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.
Th-that's all that happened. Yup.
Judge:
Hmm... Anything strange in that testimony, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure... But I'd like to proceed with the cross-examination anyway.
Cross Examination
-- No Photo? --
Cody:
Yeah, you're right, pops.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Pops"...?
Cody:
Yeah, I called you "pops," you spiky-haired geezer!
Phoenix:
G-geezer...?
Edgeworth:
I'm "Mr. Edgeworth."
Judge:
And I guess I'm the "bearded gentleman"...
Cody:
That's what I hate about grown-ups. You're all so self-conscious!
Phoenix:
Okay, off with the kid gloves! Testify, witness, testify!
Cody:
Yipes!
Cody:
The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you did see the beginning of the fight?
Cody:
Yeah.
Phoenix:
Did you notice anything unusual?
Cody:
Umm... well... uh... I guess the Steel Samurai was moving a little strange...
Phoenix:
(Moving... strangely?)
Cody:
So I held up my camera to take a picture!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why couldn't you take a picture?
Cody:
My new camera has too many buttons. I couldn't figure it out. I tried to take a picture, I really tried.
Cody:
But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
When the lens opened, what did you see?
Cody:
Uh... well, a person on the ground. And the Steel Samurai!
Cody:
Th-that's all that happened. Yup.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
That's all?
Cody:
Y-yeah! I told you, I didn't take a picture!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I would have, once I got that lens open... Did he really not take a picture? Not even one?)
Press him hard
Phoenix:
(Nah, he definitely would have taken a picture. There's got to be something here I can use!) Cody! Listen up, Cody Hackins. I know exactly what happened that day. You took a picture!
Cody:
... Hey!
Phoenix:
(Bullseye...?)
Cody:
H-how did you know!?
Phoenix:
I see through all your lies Cody Hackins. It's one of my powers!
Cody:
W-wow!
Phoenix:
(This feels great!)
Cody:
Y-yeah... Yeah, I took a picture.
Judge:
Perhaps you can change your testimony to reflect this, Cody?
Change statement:
"Th-that's all that happened. Yup." to "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em."
Let it slide
Phoenix:
(He looks ready to burst into tears... I'd better lay off him for now.)
Cody:
I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You "erased" them?
Cody:
Y-yeah!
Phoenix:
Why would you erase a picture of your beloved Steel Samurai, victorious?
Cody:
Well... y'know. W-why would I want to keep a picture like that?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... he's becoming less and less cooperative. I better find a clear contradiction soon... or some solid evidence.)
Present "Path to Glory"
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Cody!"
Phoenix:
(How can I pick holes in such a short testimony?)
Mia:
There has to be something. Dig up the dirt, Phoenix! Find out what this kid's all about!
Phoenix:
Cody!
Cody:
Wh-wh-what!? Man, every time you say "Cody" you follow it with something bad.
Phoenix:
I just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day.
Cody:
Huh? O-oh... right.
Phoenix:
What was it you told me then?
Cody:
I go to every live performance! I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection!
Phoenix:
Cody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album?
Cody:
Ah!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... What exactly is this album?
Phoenix:
It's called "Path to Glory." It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won!
Judge:
I... I see.
Phoenix:
Don't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day!
Judge:
Order! Mr. Wright. Have you an explanation? If the Steel Samurai had just defeated his adversary... I certainly would expect to see a picture of it in this album...
Phoenix:
Exactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! (No... wait... no way!)
Mia:
Phoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is!
Phoenix:
M-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...?
Mia:
Yes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what is going on here! Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder? Why would the boy have erased the photos he took?
The photos were blurry
Phoenix:
I believe that Cody Hackins is what we call an "artiste."
Judge:
An... "artiste"...?
Phoenix:
He didn't like the photos he had taken! They were blurry, or maybe his framing was off... Anyway, for some reason, he erased the data!
Judge:
Is that right, Cody?
Cody:
Wh-what do you mean "framing was off"!?
Judge:
It seems the only thing "off" is your guesswork, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Um, uh... Yes, well, I'm sure the reall reason is...
Judge:
Yes? The real reason is?
Leads back to:
"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?"
He erased them by mistake
Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. Cody wasn't used to using his new camera. He erased those photos he took by mistake!
Mia:
W-wait a second, Phoenix. If that's your answer, we're back where we started!
Phoenix:
Huh? You mean, that wasn't it?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! If you have something to say to the court, speak up!
Phoenix:
Um, well... S-sorry, Your Honor. Can I change my answer?
Judge:
Hmm... *sigh*
Leads back to:
"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?"
The Steel Samurai didn't win
Leads to:
"I can think of only one reason, your honor."
Phoenix:
I can think of only one reason, your honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos.
Judge:
You mean the Steel Samurai... lost?
Phoenix:
Well, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai!
Cody:
N-n-n-no way! No! I-it's impossible! Th-the Steel Samurai never loses! He never loses to anyone! Ever!
Phoenix:
Your Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. He couldn't handle the truth!
Judge:
O-Order! I will have order! W-witness! I mean, Cody! Is this true!? W-what did you see? Tell the court what you saw!
Cody:
I...... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
Phoenix:
Cody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right?
Cody:
Waaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay okay! Y-you're right! Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell down... Th-then he didn't m-move... Waaaaaaaaah!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Edgeworth:
What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was the murderer, not the victim!
Phoenix:
Yet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's going on?
Phoenix:
Apparently, we have all made a serious error.
Edgeworth:
An... error? What's this all about!?
Hammer was the victim
Phoenix:
Quite simply, the victim was Jack Hammer!
Judge:
...
Edgeworth:
...
...
Judge:
Umm... Mr. Wright? We all know that.
Phoenix:
Right.
Judge:
Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your last statement?
Phoenix:
... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.
Edgeworth:
Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?
Phoenix:
L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!
Edgeworth:
If you're so sure, then tell us what it is!
Leads back to:
"What's this all about!?"
Steel Samurai was the victim
Leads to:
"If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple."
There was no victim
Phoenix:
There was no victim in this case!
Judge:
Wh-wh-what!? Has the defense taken leave of its senses!?
Phoenix:
Of course, Jack Hammer died. But the Steel Samurai fell too! It was a draw!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
... Sorry. I was too shocked to say anything for a bit there. Listen, Wright! Only one person died in this incident, and that is Jack Hammer! Yet now you claim there "was no victim"? Are you insane?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, he's pulling out all the stops now.) ... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.
Edgeworth:
Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?
Phoenix:
L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!
Edgeworth:
If you're so sure, then tell us what it is!
Leads back to:
"What's this all about!?"
Phoenix:
If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not the killer, he was the victim! Don't you see? Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! So, the Steel Samurai in this photograph... You're saying the man in this costume was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer?
Phoenix:
That's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury.
Judge:
B-but wait! Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone to Studio One already?
Phoenix:
That's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony?
Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.
Phoenix:
Mr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume.
Judge:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
But why would the victim do such a thing?
Phoenix:
I... don't know.
Cody:
... I get it!
Phoenix:
?
Cody:
I thought that the Steel Samurai was moving strange. So it was a different person inside the suit! Pops!
Phoenix:
Huh, me? What?
Cody:
Actually, there was one piece of data I saved.
Phoenix:
Data?
Cody:
Yeah, a photo on my digital camera!
Phoenix:
! W-what!?
Edgeworth:
Show us, quick!
Cody:
No way man, not if you're gonna look at me like that!
Judge:
Now!
Cody:
*sniff* Here... This is it.
Judge:
... Well, looking at this it's still a little hard to say. I'm afraid that it could be anyone in that costume. Your opinion, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence.
Judge:
I'm sorry, this doesn't look like it's the proof we need. I'll give it back.
Mia:
Wait, Phoenix!
Phoenix:
Mia? What?
Mia:
Look at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial!
Phoenix:
Wh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please?
Judge:
C-certainly. I don't see why not.
Mia:
Phoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo!
Phoenix:
(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)
Present Number "2" sign
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Your Honor! Look at this!"
Present Steel Samurai
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
It's right here!
Judge:
The Steel Samurai...?
Phoenix:
Yes, that's about the only thing in this picture that could be inconsistent. The Steel Samurai is inconsistent with... something.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Wright! This is no time for daydreaming and pointless pontification! Think about your client, and us, who are forced to listen to your rambling!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please rethink your position.
Leads back to:
"(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
I think it's here.
Judge:
You seem to be lacking even more confidence than usual.
Phoenix:
I suppose that's because I'm not confident about it at all.
Judge:
Maybe you want to rethink your case, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, please, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)"
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Look at this!
Judge:
I see... a gate?
Phoenix:
Might I draw your attention to the number on that gate?
Judge:
The number? Ah yes. Well, it's hard to see, but it looks like a "2."
Phoenix:
Clearly not a "1," Your Honor, correct?
Edgeworth:
Aaaaaah!
Phoenix:
I believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at.
Edgeworth:
B-but... Th-that's impossible!
Judge:
Hmm? Eh? What's this all about? Please explain so that I might be shocked along with the rest of the court.
Phoenix:
I'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say "1" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! (Show the judge where the murder took place!)
Present Studio Two
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Here, at Studio Two."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
It was here!
Judge:
What does that have to do with the number on the gate in the photograph...?
Phoenix:
Umm... well... Sorry, Your Honor, I guess I hadn't thought it that far through yet.
Judge:
Think it through before you point at the map this time, Mr. Wright! Once again! Where is he scene of this crime?
Leads back to:
"(Show the judge where the murder took place!)"
Phoenix:
Here, at Studio Two.
Judge:
I see! That would explain the "2" on the gate in the photo.
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!
The trailer is there
Phoenix:
As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime! The path to the trailer was blocked!
Judge:
So we have heard.
Phoenix:
The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!
Judge:
Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.
Phoenix:
Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two!
Leads to:
"O-order! Order!"
The path was blocked
Phoenix:
The path to the trailer was blocked!
Judge:
So we have heard.
Phoenix:
The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!
Judge:
Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.
Phoenix:
Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two! As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime!
Leads to:
"O-order! Order!"
No filming is done there
Phoenix:
Studio Two is no longer being used for filming!
Judge:
I see... And this is significant... why?
Phoenix:
(Good question! I really should think these things through more.)
Judge:
Would you like to take another stab at it? So to speak?
Phoenix:
S-stabbing away, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!"
Judge:
O-order! Order!
Phoenix:
The defense makes the following claims: The scene of the crime was Studio Two! The person that the security guard, Ms. Oldbag saw was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer! Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! The victim! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!?
Phoenix:
W-well, no, of course not...
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
Or do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume!
I have proof
Phoenix:
I have proof!
Edgeworth:
Y-you do!?
Judge:
You do, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Now that they're so surprised suddenly I'm much less confident... I think I'm right, though!)
Leads to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"
I don't have proof
Phoenix:
(Proof? Uh oh... I'm pretty sure I don't have anything like that...)
Mia:
Phoenix. Even if you're not 100% sure about this, you have to try. And I think you've got proof that's good enough to win them over! Just go for it! All or nothing!
Phoenix:
Your Honor...
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Actually... I do have proof.
Leads to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"
Phoenix:
Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!
Present Empty Bottle
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is it."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(Wait, no, that can't be right... I've got to have some proof that will knock their socks off...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! We don't have all the time in the world, here.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"
Phoenix:
This is it.
Judge:
An empty... medicine bottle?
Phoenix:
I found this on the table in the Employee Area. The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads "sleeping pills."
Judge:
"Sleeping pills"...?
Phoenix:
The defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer!
Judge:
Wait a moment... That bottle does raise some suspicions, yes. But there is no proof that Mr. Hammer used it.
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I have an idea.
Test Powers's blood
Judge:
An... idea? Continue.
Phoenix:
Run a test of Powers's blood. You should find traces of the sleeping pills.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This much time after the day of the murder!? Even if there were traces it still proves nothing! No blood test could tell that Hammer was the one who drugged him, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(He's right. Darn. That didn't work. Time to try another idea.)
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I have an idea."
Fingerprint the bottle
Leads to:
"An... idea? Very well, let's hear it."
Examine Hammer's body
Judge:
An idea, Mr. Wright? And that would be?
Phoenix:
Er... we should examine Mr. Hammer's body.
Judge:
Mr. Hammer...? I thought that it was Mr. Powers who was made to take the sleeping pills?
Phoenix:
I-indeed it was, Your Honor. (Wrong again...)
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I have an idea."
Judge:
An... idea? Very well, let's hear it.
Phoenix:
I want to check this bottle for fingerprints! If my claim is true, Mr. Hammer's fingerprints should show up on this bottle!
Edgeworth:
Hmm...
Judge:
I suppose you're right. Very well. The court will take possession of the bottle.
Empty Bottle given to the judge.
Judge:
This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Cody Hackin's [sic] testimony has revealed new possibilities in this case. In fact, things may have happened very differently than we previously thought. The Steel Samurai seen by Ms. Oldbag may have been the victim, Jack Hammer. The scene of the crime was not Studio One, but Studio Two. And those in the trailer did have time to commit murder. Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
Your homework is to find the answer to the following question: Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Also, who killed him, and why? Find the answers for me by tomorrow.
Phoenix:
(That's a lot of homework!)
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Mm?
Judge:
You will need to reconsider your stance in this case. Above all, you will need to reconsider your suspicion of Mr. Will Powers.
Edgeworth:
As you say, Your Honor.
Judge:
This trial will be extended until tomorrow. This is the last extension! Very well... Court is adjourned!
October 19, 2:47 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Phoenix:
Whew! That was a close one!
Mia:
We were saved by a hair, but that's all that counts. I thought seriously about going home about three times during the trial.
Phoenix:
M-me too!
Will:
Really? You both seemed so... so confident!
Phoenix:
Hah! Maybe I should take up a career in acting? I was ready to pronounce you dead about three times back there.
Mia:
Me too!
Will:
D-dead!?
Mia:
Hoh hoh. Of course, we're kidding.
Will:
Are you sure?
Phoenix:
(I wasn't kidding...) Now, Mr. Powers. We have to go make our final investigation. But I promise you, we'll find the true killer by tomorrow's trial!
Will:
R-right! Thanks! *sniff*
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh...)
Judge:
This court finds the defendant, Mr. Will Powers...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over
