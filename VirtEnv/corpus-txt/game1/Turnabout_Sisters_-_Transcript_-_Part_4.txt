September 9, 9:52 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Maya:
Well... I guess this is it!
Phoenix:
Yeah. One way or another, this case gets decided today.
Maya:
Aaa! Ph-Phoenix! Look!
Phoenix:
(...! Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)
Edgeworth:
I received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.
Phoenix:
?
Edgeworth:
He told me that whatever Mr. White says today, it will be the "absolute truth." No matter how you try to attack his testimony... If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.
Phoenix:
(What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?) So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?
Edgeworth:
... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.
Maya:
Why... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?
Edgeworth:
"Innocent"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared "guilty"! So I make that my policy.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth... You've changed.
Maya:
Hmm? Phoenix! You know him!?
Edgeworth:
Don't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.
Maya:
Ph-Phoenix...?
Phoenix:
Well... court will be opening for session soon.
Maya:
What? But wait! Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! He's not...
Phoenix:
I'll be defending myself.
Maya:
Whaaaat!?
Phoenix:
Okay, let's do this.
September 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1
Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
Mr. Wright... Are you sure you're up to doing this?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.
Judge:
Understood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.
Edgeworth:
As the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.
Judge:
I see. The prosecution may call its witness.
Phoenix:
(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)
Objection
Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court.
Judge:
Excellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Great. He gets to show off and I get nowhere.)
Leads to:
"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!"
Let it go
Phoenix:
(Forget it. I smell a trap.)
Leads to:
"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!"
Edgeworth:
I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!
Edgeworth:
Please state your full name.
White:
You wish to know the title of my personage?
Edgeworth:
Er... your name?
White:
Yes! That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?
Edgeworth:
Name!
Phoenix:
(These two are great together...)
White:
My name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp.
Edgeworth:
Did you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?
White:
That would be a negatory! No, I did not.
Edgeworth:
... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?
White:
Correct.
Edgeworth:
And you witnessed the murder from there?
White:
Ahem. Why tell you what you already know?
Judge:
Very well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.
Phoenix:
(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)
White:
Ho hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!
Phoenix:
...!
Maya:
Let him have it, Phoenix!
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
White:
Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.
I was quietly perusifying... er, that's "reading" to you, some papers by the window.
Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!
Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.
It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!
Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!
I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was flabbergasted of course.
The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!
Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...
Judge:
Hmm... If things occurred as you testify, then I'm afraid the defendant is guilty. Very well, defendant... er, I mean, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination...
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Cross Examination
-- Witness's Account --
White:
Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How do you know what time it was?
White:
Because I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect, you know?
Phoenix:
No no no, you're not getting away with that!
White:
You are so mistrusting, Mr. Lawyer! So... what was the proper term for "secretary" again...? Anyway, Miss May ordered room service for 9:00. It happened soon after the room service arrived.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. That's what Miss May said, too.)
Press further
Phoenix:
True, the bellboy who brought the coffee saw Miss May. But he testified that he did not see you at the time!
White:
Ahem. This is your concern? Silly Lawyer! Miss May received the coffee outside the room! Of course he could not see me. He would need X-ray vision to pull off something like that!
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Edgeworth:
Tell us, what were you doing at the time?
Hold back
Phoenix:
(I don't see anything to gain by attacking him on this point any further.) Okay, what were you doing at the time?
White:
I was quietly perusifying... er, that's "reading" to you, some papers by the window.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
By window, you mean the one directly across from the Fey &amp; Co. Law Office?
White:
Correct! That is the only window, you see.
Phoenix:
And there you were reading... papers?
White:
Correct! The Gatewater is a businessman's hotel, and I am a busy man who had business to do!
White:
Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
A "bedlam"?
White:
It must have been when you attacked, I assume.
Edgeworth:
We see. Continue.
White:
Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you were reading your papers until you heard that sound?
White:
But of course. I am no snoop, peeping out of windows at night.
Phoenix:
(No snoop? Yeah, right! You've made a career out of snooping!)
White:
It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
S-spiky-haired!?
White:
Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What you just said directly conflicts with Miss May's testimony! Miss May clearly stated that the assailant looked like a "girl"!
White:
I've always been proud of my eyesight, Mr. Lawyer.
Phoenix:
Just what is your eyesight?
White:
Counting both eyes... 40!
Phoenix:
40!? Don't add them together!
Judge:
I think the witness is trying to say his eyesight is good.
Phoenix:
(Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?)
Edgeworth:
And what did you do then?
White:
I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was surprised of course.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What was Miss May doing at that time?
White:
She had just finished watching a soap opera on the TV, and was weeping openly.
Phoenix:
Did you know she had been tapping the Fey office phone?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Irrelevant! That has nothing to do with the case at hand.
White:
I care not. I will answer the lawyer's bold inquiry. Miss May was acting alone when she tapped the phone of this Fey woman.
Phoenix:
You'd make a good politician, Mr. White.
White:
Ho hoh! After all, I am "El Presidente."
Judge:
Please continue.
White:
The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Can you be a little more detailed about that? I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened.
White:
Of course! Comprende! I understand! The victim was attacked, by you, and ran to the left. You gave chase, and struck her down!
Edgeworth:
Are you sure?
White:
As you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect!
Judge:
Perhaps you could change your testimony to reflect this new detail.
Change statement:
"The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!" to "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!"
White:
The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure about that?
White:
How many times must I say it? I am abso-posi-lutely perfect! End of story!
Phoenix:
(How many times must I hear that?)
Maya:
Psst! Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as a little odd?
Present May Testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait right there!"
White:
Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Um... "impaction"? Don't you mean just "impact"?
White:
Ridiculosity! I think you need to brush up on your language skills!
Phoenix:
(On second thought, perhaps I'd better leave the whole language thing alone...)
Phoenix:
(Did Edgeworth "prep" this guy, too, I wonder? Anyway, I'd better find a weakness in there...)
Phoenix:
Wait right there! Mr. White, you've dug your own grave!
White:
What is this!?
Phoenix:
You said the victim ran to the "left." But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran "right"!
White:
...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.
Phoenix:
I think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?
White:
! Very strange... I did see her run to the left... I did.
Maya:
Phoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.
Phoenix:
True. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
Miss May says "right," and Mr. White says "left." Can you explain this contradiction to the court?
Mr. White is right
Phoenix:
As Mr. White testified, Mia ran to the left.
Judge:
But... But if that's the case... Why would she run in the opposite direction from the door?
Phoenix:
She did not. She was running towards the door, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
Bwah! Now you're the one making a contradiction, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Not at all.
Leads to:
"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!"
Miss May is right
Phoenix:
As Miss May has stated, Mia ran to the right after she was attacked.
White:
What is this? I am not fashioning fabrications, I assure you! That lady ran to the left! I am sure of it!
Phoenix:
Then there can be only one explanation.
Edgeworth:
Eh...? And that is?
Leads to:
"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!"
Both are right
Phoenix:
Both witnesses are telling the truth. (For once...)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I doubt it! Er, rather, that does not clear up the contradiction!
Phoenix:
There is one scenario that would explain their conflicting accounts.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Leads to:
"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!"
Phoenix:
Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
Yes, what do you mean, he was not "viewing the crime from the hotel"!? If he was not in the hotel, where could he have been!?
Phoenix:
In the law offices of Fey &amp; Co., of course! More specifically, he was standing here! (Show the court where Mr. White was standing!)
Present killer's location
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is where he was!"
Present victim's location
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
That's where he was!
Edgeworth:
M-Mr. Wright! We are not fools! How could he have been exactly where the victim was standing!?
Phoenix:
(Oh... oh, right!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honor! Sorry! Let me try that again...
Leads back to:
"(Show the court where Mr. White was standing!)"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
That's where he was!
Judge:
Hold it right there, Mr. Wright! If he was there during the very act of murder... That would make him an accomplice!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Impossible! There was no one other than the criminal and victim in the room! There is no evidence, no proof to the contrary! None!
Phoenix:
S-sorry! Er... let me try that again!
Leads back to:
"(Show the court where Mr. White was standing!)"
Phoenix:
This is where he was! Look! When the victim ran for the door... If he was watching from this point, to him it would appear that she ran to the "left."
Edgeworth:
Please! This is no time for jokes in ill taste! That is where the killer was standing!
Judge:
Order! I will have order! Anyone disturbing the order of this courtroom will be held in contempt! Mr. Wright! What are you suggesting!?
White:
R-r-rapscallion!!!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The postulations of the defense are a distortion of the truth, Your Honor!
Judge:
Indeed. They do seem a bit far-fetched...
White:
... Ho hoh hoh! You provide us with so much entertainment, Mr. Lawyer!
Phoenix:
(What now!? He's... laughing!?)
White:
The hilarity of the moment made me remember something... It appears I have been unclear, and for this, I apologize. Mr. Your Honor... Might I be allowed to testify once more?
Judge:
Very well, let's hear your revised testimony.
Phoenix:
(Good luck. You can't fix a broken testimony, buddy!)
Witness Testimony
-- She Ran to the "Left" --
White:
Miss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!
When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left.
And then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw.
Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.
You chased her, and delivered the final blow.
That is what Miss May saw.
You see? You hit her twice!
Don't you remember, Mr. Lawyer?
Judge:
Hmm... That does seem to make sense. Will you be cross-examining the witness's testimony?
Phoenix:
You bet I will! I mean, yes, Your Honor.
Cross Examination
-- She Ran to the "Left" --
White:
Miss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean by that!
White:
That is what I am about to explain! You Americans, always so impatient! It does not become you.
Phoenix:
(Hey buddy, you're an American, too!)
White:
When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean "first"?
White:
"First"? That is what comes before what happens "next." You do speak English, right? Please, sit back, relax. I will try to use simple words for your benefit. First, she ran to the left, and then...
White:
And then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
I didn't hit anyone!
White:
Now, now, Mr. Wright. There is no point hiding things from this court.
Phoenix:
I'm not hiding anything!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The prosecution requests that the defense refrain from interrupting the testimony!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, you have been warned.
Phoenix:
(Why's he mad at me!?)
White:
Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean "next"!?
White:
"Next" is what comes after "first."
Phoenix:
I know that!
White:
Then that is all you need to know, Mr. Lawyer. As I said, she turned and made a desperate dash to the right.
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. White!"
White:
You chased her, and delivered the final blow.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Stop saying it was me!
White:
But, it was you.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! If you claim that it was NOT you, then show us proof!
Phoenix:
(Argh! Can I do nothing right? Nothing!?)
White:
May I continue?
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. White!"
White:
That is what Miss May saw.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So each of you saw different parts...?
White:
Abso-posi-lutely! That's right, of course!
Phoenix:
(Where did he pick up that annoying phrase...?)
White:
Anyway, moving along!
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. White!"
White:
You see? You hit her twice!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So were you watching both times?
White:
I suppose I was. And please excuse me for not testifying to this sooner!
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. White!"
Maya:
What do you think Phoenix?
Phoenix:
I think we've got him right where we want him! He slipped! Let him laugh for now. I'll soon wipe that smile off his face!
Phoenix:
Mr. White! The victim died from a "single" blow!
White:
...!
Phoenix:
What do you have to say to that?
White:
Er... Erp!
Phoenix:
(Now's my chance to hit him where it counts!) Mr. White. Wasn't it you who told this court you were "abso-posi-lutely perfect"?
White:
Mmph. I will refrain from using this phrase from now on.
Phoenix:
Your Honor, if you could ask the witness for a new testimony...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The witness is obviously confused, Your Honor! I would like to request a 10 minute break!
Judge:
Yes... yes, quite.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness is confused because he's lying! I emphatically request that there be no break, Your Honor!
(Yeah! We want justice...!)
(Don't let him get away!)
Judge:
Very well. If the witness would care to revise his testimony...
Phoenix:
(The crowd's on my side! No slipping out of this now, White!)
Judge:
Mr. White?
White:
O... okay...
Witness Testimony
-- The Two Accounts --
White:
Umm, well, see--I looked at the other window when I heard that thing fall.
Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!
The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged.
Umm... and then...
She turned, and ran for the door!
Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!
Judge:
Hmm. "Thwap" indeed. Very well, you may begin the cross-examination.
White:
Mr. Your Honor... My stomach, you see, it is hurting...
Phoenix:
Deal with it. This is almost over.
White:
...!
Cross Examination
-- The Two Accounts --
White:
Umm, well, see--I looked at the other window when I heard that thing fall.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You heard "that thing fall"? What exactly was "that thing"?
White:
Huh? Oh... oh, that? Umm... the glass light stand!
Phoenix:
(Right... the one that had fallen over at the scene.)
Maya:
Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as odd?
Yeah, very odd
Leads to:
"(Yeah, that is odd. I'll press further.)"
Nope
Phoenix:
Huh? No, not really. Please continue your cross-examination.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, that is odd. I'll press further.) Mr. White.
White:
Huh? W-what?
Phoenix:
You're saying you saw the glass light stand?
White:
Y-yes.
Phoenix:
Then change your testimony to reflect that!
White:
S-sorry. My bad...
Judge:
The witness will revise his testimony.
White:
Okay okay. Of course.
Change statement to:
"A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked."
White:
A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The "glass stand was lying on the floor"? That's the first I've heard of this. Why didn't you tell us about the stand before?
White:
W-why? Me? W-well... I was instructed not to... wait! One moment! Give me a minute to gather my thoughts. I am so... so confused.
Phoenix:
(White's falling apart.)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! Please, I ask that you do not allow the witness to be badgered any further!
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright. Please refrain from badgering the witness...
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (Edgeworth is on the ropes!)
Judge:
Very well. The witness may continue his account.
Present Glass Shards
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Mr. White. It was impossible for you to have seen the light stand!
White:
Whaaaat!?
Phoenix:
The stand broke into pieces when it fell!
White:
Ooof!
Phoenix:
Just by seeing the broken pieces you would have no idea it was a light stand! So tell me, exactly when was it that you saw the stand? Answer the question!
White:
...! I-isn't it obvious? I saw the stand before it fell over!
Phoenix:
So... you saw the stand before the victim was attacked, then?
White:
C-correct! That would be no problemo, right?
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
No problemo
Phoenix:
Right. I guess there isn't a problem.
Judge:
Very well. Now...
Maya:
Ph-Phoenix! Wait!
Phoenix:
Huh? What?
Maya:
He saw the stand through the office window before it fell over... That's what he's saying, right?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess so.
Maya:
How could that be possible?
Phoenix:
Huh...? Why not?
Maya:
There's no way he could have seen it! And you have proof!
Phoenix:
... Oh!
Judge:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honor! I guess there is a problemo, er, I mean, a problem.
Judge:
I see. Please try to think before you speak, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honor. But, I have proof!
Leads to:
"A person in the hotel could not have seen the stand before it fell over!"
Big problemo
Phoenix:
There's a big problemo, er, I mean problem here.
White:
What problem is this?
Phoenix:
Mr. White, let me make sure I have this straight... You saw the glass light stand through the window, from the hotel... before the incident occurred?
White:
Correct! That is so! It's conclusive, definitive, undeniable... unimpeachable!
Phoenix:
No, it's impossible! You couldn't have seen the stand!
Judge:
What? Why couldn't he? You have proof?
Phoenix:
I sure do, Your Honor!
Leads to:
"A person in the hotel could not have seen the stand before it fell over!"
Phoenix:
A person in the hotel could not have seen the stand before it fell over!
Present Floor Plans
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Look at this!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is the proof! ...
Judge:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
N-no... it's just...
Maya:
Phoenix... I don't think that's what you meant.
Phoenix:
(I don't think so either.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright. The courtroom is no place to play practical jokes.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Your Honor. Let me try that again.
Leads back to:
"A person in the hotel could not have seen the stand before it fell over!"
Present Floor Plans
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Mr. White. It was impossible for you to have seen the glass stand!
White:
Whaaaat!?
Leads to:
"Look at this!"
White:
Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Miss Mia"...? Mr. White, did you know the victim personally?
White:
No no no, triple no! How would I? How could I!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I see nothing odd about the witness knowing the name of the victim. Mr. Wright! I will not have you harrying the witness!
Phoenix:
(You're looking a little flustered, Edgeworth!)
White:
The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Now before, you said that she was hit before she ran.
White:
Y-yes, I must have been confused. But don't worry! We all know what happened now.
White:
She turned, and ran for the door!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What did you do then?
White:
I gave chase, of course! ...! No! No! Not me. Th-the killer, I mean! He gave chase!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. White, please try to remain calm. Mr. Wright here is only trying to fluster you with baseless accusations!
White:
Oh... oh right. Thank you, Miles.
White:
Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Thwap"...? That doesn't sound like the "savage" attack from your earlier testimony...
White:
Ho! Hoh hoh! Yes, well, I am a man of peace, you see.
Maya:
Phoenix! He's getting a lot less talkative.
Phoenix:
He's probably afraid I'll catch him on something! (But it won't be easy!)
Phoenix:
Look at this!
Judge:
These are the floor plans to the scene of the murder, yes?
Phoenix:
Correct, Your Honor. Now, look... If you were to look through the window at the office... This is the area you would be able to see! Here! Well...? Note that the stand is not within the visible area! Well, Mr. White! What do you have to say to that!?
White:
Er... erp! Ri... dicu... losity...
Phoenix:
Mr. White. If you were in the Gatewater hotel as you claim, you could not have seen the stand before it fell over! In fact, you wouldn't have been able to see it after it fell, either! There's no way you could have recognized the broken shards as a glass light stand! So, when did you see the stand, Mr. White? It must have been the moment that it fell! And the only place you could have seen that from... is inside the Fey Law Offices! In other words, you were at the scene of the crime, when the murder took place!
White:
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
Judge:
Mr... White?
White:
...
Phoenix:
Mr. White.
White:
...
Phoenix:
You did it, didn't you?
White:
... Mr. Your Honor. I... I... Miss Mia... ...
Phoenix:
(Heh. Looks like we're about to get our verdict!)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That's far enough, Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:
W-what!? (Urk! I forgot about Edgeworth!)
Edgeworth:
Mr. White...
White:
...
Edgeworth:
I think the time has come. Shouldn't you confess your crime now, hmm?
White:
W... what?
Edgeworth:
I said, you should confess your crime. Ergo, confess that you placed the wiretap!
Phoenix:
The w-wiretap!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! Explain to the court what you mean by this!
Edgeworth:
Distinguished members of of the court... Mr. White is slightly confused. Allow me to explain.
Phoenix:
(I really don't like the way this is headed...)
Edgeworth:
As you know, Mr. White is the CEO of Bluecorp. He ordered his secretary, Miss April May, to tap the law offices of Ms. Fey.
Judge:
What does that have to do...?
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The question is: when was the wiretap placed in the office, and by who?
Phoenix:
No! You wouldn't!
Edgeworth:
Mr. White. In order to place the wiretap, you entered Ms. Fey's office. Am I correct...?
White:
...&#160;! C-correct! You are most correct, Miles!
Phoenix:
Give me a break!
White:
Yes... in order to place the wiretap, I breached the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices! That is when I saw that accursed light stand!
Judge:
Now I'm confused. Please explain to the court what all this means, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Gladly, Your Honor. Mr. Phoenix Wright has made his position quite clear. He has determined that Mr. White knew the glass stand was in the office. He has shown that there was only one time Mr. White could have seen the stand: At the very moment of the murder! Thus, Mr. Wright would like you to believe that Mr. White was the murderer!
Judge:
I see.
Edgeworth:
However! It is a fact that Mr. White had been to that office well before the murder took place! He went to place the wiretap! He could have seen the glass light stand then. Ergo, Mr. Phoenix Wright's theory is revealed for the baseless conjecture it is!
Judge:
Mr. White! You will testify to the court about this wiretap!
White:
Ahem. Leave it to me!
Phoenix:
(I... I feel faint.)
Witness Testimony
-- The Wiretapping --
White:
It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.
I had entered the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices.
Of course, I had done so to place the wiretap.
That is when I saw this glass light stand.
Judge:
Hmm... So, you saw the stand before the night of the incident... And this is how you were able to identify what had fallen over. By the sound?
White:
Correct! That is right.
Judge:
I see. Very well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine.
Phoenix:
(Gah! What am I supposed to do now...!?)
Maya:
Good luck, Phoenix...

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
D-do you have proof!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Miss April May knew the details of Ms. Fey's phone conversation! This proves that the wiretap was placed before the murder!
Phoenix:
Huh... right.
White:
I had entered the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Was it really you that went into the office? Or was it Miss May?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Unidentified fingerprints several days old were found in the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices. Those were obviously Mr. White's.
Phoenix:
(And if I know Edgeworth, he's already run a check on those prints...)
Edgeworth:
Now, Mr. White. Tell us why you went to the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices.
White:
Of course, I had done so to place the wiretap.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why did you tap Mia's phone!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That has no bearing on the current case, Your Honor.
White:
Bluecorp is a detective agency of sorts. We have a responsibility to protect client confidentiality!
White:
That is when I saw this glass light stand.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why did you notice something as innocuous as a light stand!?
White:
The light stand was made entirely out of glass. It was quite stylish, so I guess it made a lasting impression on me. Such a beautacious thing deserves attention, does it not? That is all.
Phoenix:
(Dammit! There's nothing there for me to press him on! Oh well... maybe he's rattled enough that I can bluff something out of him!)
(Pressing all statements leads to:)
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Don't tell me I've run out of ammo!)
Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk. I'm afraid that's as far as you go, Mr. Wright. The time has come for you to admit your defeat! You fought... honorably.
Phoenix:
(No more... I can't take this anymore...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright? Are you giving up?
Phoenix:
... Y-yes, Your Honor.
???:
(Phoenix!)
Phoenix:
...?
???:
(Phoenix! Over here!)
Phoenix:
(I know that voice! ... M-Mia!?)
Mia:
Never give up, Phoenix!
Phoenix:
...!!!! M-M-Mia...!
Phoenix:
Where... Where am I? The waiting lobby...? What happened? ... Oh, right... I lost the trial. I was... hallucinating. ...
Mia:
Ah, you're finally awake.
Phoenix:
Gak!
Mia:
H-hey! Phoenix! ... "Gak"? That's no way to greet an old friend! Phoenix, I want you to look at me.
Phoenix:
Y-You're... M-Maya...?
Mia:
Didn't you know the Fey women have strong psychic powers...? When you accepted your defeat in court... It appears that was enough of a shock to awaken Maya's true powers.
Phoenix:
So... Maya is channeling you, Mia?
Mia:
That's right. I am Maya, but I'm also Mia. Now, I want you to listen to me, Phoenix. Maya never gave up. You can't either! That's what I came here to tell you.
Phoenix:
...! B-but!
Mia:
We don't have much time, Phoenix. Now listen. You've already won.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Mia:
You have that Receipt in the court record, right?
Phoenix:
Um... oh, yeah! The one you wrote "Maya" on...?
Mia:
Phoenix! White wrote that, not me!
Phoenix:
So... so what do I do with it?
Mia:
Look at the front of the receipt!
Phoenix:
The... front? (It's a regular receipt... Looks like it's from a famous department store. "$1,000.00"... wow, big spender! "Item"... "glass light stand"...! "Date of purchase"... "September 4"...) ...! September 4!
Mia:
That's right, Phoenix. I bought that stand the day before I was killed!
Phoenix:
Whoa!
Mia:
Now, what did Mr. White say in his testimony?
White:
It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.
Phoenix:
He said he saw the stand the week before the murder!
Mia:
There you go! I think the court is about to reconvene! Go do it, Phoenix! You know you're innocent, now you just have to prove it!
Phoenix:
Right!
Receipt updated in the Court Record.
September 9, 1:16 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1
Judge:
The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright. Is the defendant... rather, are you alright, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes. Sorry, Your Honor. I'm fine now.
Judge:
Then, let's start where we left off.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. There is nothing to go back to! The cross-examination of Mr. White is finished! All that is required now is for you to pass judgment on the defendant Phoenix Wright!
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Please, give me one more chance. I promise you, this is the last time I'll ask you!
Judge:
Hmm... But, as Mr. Edgeworth has noted, the trial is more or less finished. Mr. Edgeworth, do you have an opinion on this matter?
Edgeworth:
I say... let us give Mr. Phoenix Wright his "last chance."
Judge:
Very well! You may begin your cross-examination.

I think not. Look at the other side of the receipt.
Edgeworth:
Th-the other side?
Phoenix:
Your Honor. Would you tell the court what is written on the other side of that receipt?
Judge:
Hmm... Well! A "glass light stand"! And the date of purchase... Why, that's the day before the murder!
Phoenix:
You see! Mr. White. When you allegedly entered Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices at the beginning of September... The stand could not have been there!
White:
Kwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!?
Phoenix:
Well, Mr. White? Can't get out of this one, can you?
White:
No... It's impossachievable...
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... he's losing it.) ... Well, Your Honor. I understand there must be quite a bit of PRESSURE on you. But I think you'll agree you can't judge me "guilty" under these circumstances.

Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Not so fast, Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:
Eh? (What! No way he can worm his way out of this one! Oh wait... I forgot. It's Edgeworth.)
Edgeworth:
There is a certain thread of logic to the defendant's claims. However! There is no concrete proof that Phoenix Wright is innocent!
Phoenix:
(...!)
Edgeworth:
Ergo! I would like to request one more day before Phoenix Wright is granted his freedom. I need time to make one more inquiry into this matter.
Judge:
Hmm...!
Phoenix:
(Another inquiry...!? This isn't going to be another one of those "updated autopsy reports"! This guy just makes up evidence as he pleases! This is bad...!)
Object
Phoenix:
Mr. White's guilt is obvious! There is no need to prolong this trial any further!
Judge:
Hmm. Well, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
If anyone is going to call Mr. White to trial, it would be me, the prosecution. I need a day to ascertain whether your claims have any basis in factual evidence!

Hmm. I see. Objection denied!
Phoenix:
Whaaaat!
Leads to:
"The completion of the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright will be postponed until tomorrow."
Wait and see what happens
Phoenix:
(Hmm. I don't know where he's going with this. I'd better hold back for now.)
Judge:
I see... Very well. As there is no objection from the defense, I grant Mr. Edgeworth his extra day.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh...)
Leads to:
"The completion of the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright will be postponed until tomorrow."
Judge:
The completion of the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright will be postponed until tomorrow.
Phoenix:
(No! There's no telling what will happen if I can't end this now! Edgeworth is sure to come up with--or just make up--something! And after Mia showed up to help me and all...)

Mr. Your Honor! May I go home?
Judge:
Of course. Thank you for your time.

Phoenix:
Mia? What's this...?
Memo received from Mia.
Phoenix:
Your Honor. If I may...?
Judge:
You're quite persistent today, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(You bet I am! My life is riding on this one!) I have something I would like to read to the court!
Present Mia's Memo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The memo Mia had given me was a list of names."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(No... that's not it! I can't mess this one up!)
Judge:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
N-no, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"I have something I would like to read to the court!"
Phoenix:
The memo Mia had given me was a list of names. Many of them sounded strangely familiar. People in finance, famous celebrities... That's when it happened.
White:
S-s-stop! Desist! Halt! P-please, stop! Make him stop! How... how did you get that list!?
Mia:
Mr. White. Admit your guilt, right here, right now. Or else this list will be released to the press!
White:
!!!
White:
... I... I confess. I confess. I... I did it. I hit her. I hit Miss Mia with "The Thinker"! ...
Mia:
Case closed, Your Honor.
Judge:
Well, I see no reason to continue this trial. Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
You've done it again! That was quite a spirited defense!
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I guess you could say that. (If only you knew how "spirit"-ed it was!)
Judge:
Hmm. Well! This court finds the defense... Ahem! Rather, the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright...
Not Guilty

Phoenix:
Uhm, Maya... Why are you here?
Maya:
Because of this! See? Mia wrote me a letter. "Take care of Phoenix for me."
Phoenix:
Take care of... huh?
Maya:
She means the office! This office! Someone has to help with the new Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices, right? And who better but me! Maya Fey, reporting for duty! Wait, no, on second thought, let's make this casual! Yo, Nick! Maya here, ready to get down to business! You... don't mind me calling you "Nick," do you? It's a great name! Mia said that's what your friend Larry calls you.
Phoenix:
("Nick"...?)
Maya:
You know what this means? We're partners!
Phoenix:
You know, when I think about it... It is Maya's fault I'm here now. But... If it wasn't for her I'd probably be in jail! "Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices." It's got a good ring to it. Yeah! Thanks, Maya!
Mia:
(Good luck, Phoenix. I'll always be here... watching.)
Maya:
Right! Okay, Nick, let's do it!
Phoenix:
Huh? Do... what?
Maya:
Burgers, dummy! Burgers! There's a great burger joint just down the street. C'mon! Time's a wasting!
Phoenix:
O-okay! Wait up!

Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim. This court find the defense, er, rather, the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
