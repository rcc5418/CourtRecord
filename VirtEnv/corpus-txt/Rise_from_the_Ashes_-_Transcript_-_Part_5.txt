February 24, 3:12 PMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Ema:
I'm so sorry, Mr. Wright. I'm sorry for what my sister said...
Lana:
Drastic crimes require drastic measures... That's just the way it is. We did what we had to... in order for him to get the verdict he deserved.
Ema:
I... didn't know. I never knew that the "SL-9 Incident" was just another name for... the "Joe Darke Killings."
Phoenix:
(Sounds like everyone's heard about these killings but me...)
Ema:
Lana wanted Darke convicted so badly! That's why she used me... That's why she used what happened to me.
Phoenix:
What do you mean, "what happened" to you?
Ema:
It's all there in the file... Joe Darke's last victim was Prosecutor Neil Marshall. When he murdered Officer Marshall's brother, he left behind an incriminating piece of evidence.
Phoenix:
But what did you have to do with those killings, Ema?
Ema:
On the night Prosecutor Neil Marshall was murdered, Joe Darke... tried to kill me.
Phoenix:
What? He tried to kill you!?
Ema:
Officer Marshall's brother... Neil... was only trying to save me.
Phoenix:
So that means you...
Ema:
Yes. I was a witness in the Joe Darke trial.
Phoenix:
(I didn't see that one coming!)
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.
Ema:
Oh, I tried studying one of those just now. Remember what they were talking about in the trial yesterday...?
Phoenix:
Oh, right, evidence law. So, did you learn anything?
Ema:
Well, when I tried reading it made my head hurt.
Phoenix:
Oh...
Ema:
Then, when I closed it, it slipped out of my hand and fell on my foot.
Phoenix:
(Oddly enough I find myself identifying with her on this one...)
Mia's desk
Phoenix:
Mia's desk. I sit here even less now that I've stopped taking cases.
Ema:
Uh oh! I have a math test coming up next week! I'd better study! I'm borrowing this desk, okay?1 + 1 = 21 + 2 = 31 + 3 = 4
Phoenix:
(If that's what they're teaching in high school math, we're in serious trouble.)
Present
Goodman's ID or Goodman's Lost Item Report
Ema:
Mr. Goodman didn't have this on the day of the crime, right?
Phoenix:
Right. A few days before he was murdered, he had filed a lost item report. (Although "stolen item" is more like it... Swiped by that lone wolf who dressed up like him.)
Ema:
I never would have thought Officer Marshall the type to do something like that.
Phoenix:
It didn't come as much of a surprise to me...
Victim's Shoe
Phoenix:
There was something strange about this shoe, wasn't there? Let's see, what was it...?
Ema:
The traces of blood on its sole. There wasn't any blood found at the Prosecutor's Office's underground parking lot.
Phoenix:
But we did find blood on the floor somewhere, didn't we? Where was that again...?
Ema:
In the evidence room at the Police Department. Now stop using me as your memo pad!!!
ID Card Record
Ema:
There's only one number left to check out.
Phoenix:
That's right. We now know the other numbers aren't related to the murder. "7777777"... An "executive officer."
Ema:
Sevensevensevensevensevensevensevenseven...
Phoenix:
Uh, I believe that's one "seven" too many... (We can't find out whose number this is unless we have some incriminating evidence. That's going to be hard to dig up by tomorrow...)
Fingerprinting Set
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth is so kind, giving us something like this. Hey! You don't think he... he... likes me, do you? ...
Phoenix:
Are you okay, Ema?
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Hurry! RUN!!! AHH-CHOOOO!!!
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
... Here, I'll wipe those fingerprints off your face.
Phoenix:
(Might as well wipe my dignity away too while you're at it.)
Screwdriver
Phoenix:
This screwdriver was at Edgeworth's office, wasn't it?
Ema:
Yes. He said it didn't have anything to do with the crime.
Phoenix:
... Then what are we doing carrying it around?
Ema:
Hey, don't ask me! I'm not the one making the decisions around here!
Phoenix:
(If I recall... Edgeworth said Chief Gant asked him to take this to the Prosecutor's Office.)
Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
This jar's pretty fragile.
Ema:
It looks like it's about to break apart!
Phoenix:
What do you mean, "about to"? It's already broken.
Ema:
I meant again...
Phoenix:
(This piece was found in Detective Goodman's evidence locker. That means...)
Ema:
This is somehow related to that other incident...
Marshall's Prints
Phoenix:
This fingerprint was left on the locker when Marshall was stashing his bloody coat.
Ema:
I guess that blood wasn't Mr. Goodman's after all.
Phoenix:
Nope. Just that of an overly zealous patrolman.
Ema:
So there wasn't a murder at the Police Department at 5:15 in the end.
Phoenix:
(I wonder what's going to happen to Officer Marshall now...)
Security Video
Ema:
We owe our entire success in court today to this tape.
Phoenix:
At first I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be a goldmine of evidence.
Ema:
I counted a total of five clues in it.
Phoenix:
It also gave the Blue Badger some publicity... of the negative sort, that is.
SL-9 Incident Files
Phoenix:
It seems everything is somehow related to this incident.
Ema:
What was it labeled, again? The "SL-9 Incident"?
Phoenix:
Yes. The name of everyone connected to this trial is listed in here. All that's left... is to figure out just what role everyone plays in this case. If we search hard enough, I think we'll find our answers. (What exactly did, or didn't, Lana do?)
Ema:
I'm not sure I want to know everything...

Phoenix:

Ema:
Everyone's probably busy looking into what exactly went down in the evidence room. That must be where the detectives are.
Phoenix:
But we proved in court today that no one was murdered in the evidence room at 5:15 PM, on the day of the crime.
Ema:
Yeah. I thought we were finally making some headway in our case!
Phoenix:
But instead it looks like we just ended up making Lana look even more guilty.
Ema:
Hang in there, Lana...
Phoenix:
(I've got to find all the answers by tomorrow!)
Examine (left side)
Wall
Ema:
So, this is the famous divider.
Phoenix:
It sure helped us knock a hole in that testimony yesterday. Come to think of it, this divider helped our case more than the actual witness.
Ema:
The great divider! A chip off the old parking block!
Phoenix:
It's just a wall. (Scientifically speaking...)
Examine (right side)
Car
Ema:
That's about as red as a sports car can get.
Phoenix:
Yup, it's pretty red alright. (The body was found in Edgeworth's car trunk... And the lock on the trunk was broken. So, the question is why did Ms. Skye chose his car?)
Ema:
So, what model car is it?
Phoenix:
... I think it was called a "Sedan" or a "Coupe." Something like that.
Ema:
Those are car types, Mr. Wright. Not models. You're a guy, aren't you, Mr. Wright? Your supposed to know these things!
Phoenix:
(Maybe it is about time I got my driver's license...)
Trunk
Ema:
That's where we found that note.
Phoenix:
"2/21 SL-9"... The SL-9 Incident.
Ema:
A case that was due for transferal the day of the murder. I never knew... The "SL-9 Incident" referred to...
Phoenix:
The Joe Darke Killings. (Everyone in this case played some part in that incident. This has to be more than just sheer coincidence!)

Ema:
Yeah, with&#160;Lana admitting to falsifying evidence two years ago...
Phoenix:
I guess we'll just have to come back later.
Examine
Bouquet
Ema:
My, my, my! What an amazing bouquet! Just right for Mr. Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
No kidding. Hey, there's a card on it... "To be or not to be -- Wendy" ("Wendy?" ... I've heard that name somewhere before.)
Ema:
And beside it... A giant Steel Samurai! Wow, I want one!
Phoenix:
Huh? There's something written on the bottom of his foot. "To every cloud, there is a silver lining. -- Wendy"
Ema:
Was this the same message that was here yesterday?
Window
Ema:
Whoa! What a view! It must be nice to have an office on the 12th floor.
Phoenix:
I guess you would feel... important.
Ema:
Incidentally... Were you to jump out this window, your chance of fatality would be... ... Got it! 99.9998 percent!
Phoenix:
(There's a 0.0002% chance you'd live?)
February 24Police DepartmentEntrance
Marshall:
Howdy, Bambina.
Ema:
Oh, Mr. Marshall!
Marshall:
I never thought things'd turn out this way when I woke up this morning. Que serà serà. You never know where life'll lead you, eh Bambina? I should've known my luck had run out when ol' Billy dried up this morning.
Ema:
Billy...?
Phoenix:
Must be his pet cactus. Say, where are you headed?
Marshall:
Just over to the Prosecutor's Office for a little interrogation. It's a "voluntary" appearance, but we all know I won't be coming back. Sorry, but you can't go in the evidence room today, pardner.
Ema:
But Mr. Marshall... Why did you do it?
Marshall:
Why do prospectors head west? If ever there was a case I needed to know the truth about, it was that one.
Phoenix:
Before you turn yourself in, Mr. Marshall... would you mind telling us exactly what happened?
Marshall:
Hmph... Looks like I won't be getting a steak lunch today.
Examine
Blue Badger
Ema:
The Blue Badger is still writhing around today.
Phoenix:
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt and say he's dancing. (Speaking of "dancing"... The whole Police Department has been dancing about like crazy since the other day...)
Ema:
Can I take out his batteries? I just can't help but feel he's going to do something naughty!
Officers
Phoenix:
Look, that patrolman is saluting the other guy. He must be a detective!
Police:
So I cuff the lout, right? Then you know what he says? "What are you, a moron? I'm an undercover agent!"
Patrolman:
Oh, man. I hate it when that happens!
Ema:
... I guess he wasn't saluting, he was just listening to how his friend messed up.
Phoenix:
They make a good pair.
Talk
Darke trial
Marshall:
Something was fishy about that trial from the beginning. It wasn't just me either. All the detectives thought so.
Phoenix:
What do you mean, "fishy"?
Marshall:
Some of the facts reported were inconsistent with the evidence we found. For example... the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
The murder weapon? You mean... that switchblade knife with the broken tip?
Marshall:
That was Joe Darke's, all right. But... in the initial autopsy report, a question was raised.
Ema:
A question...?
Marshall:
The blade of the knife was not a perfect match with the wound the victim sustained.
Phoenix:
What does that mean?
Marshall:
It means there is a good chance that knife was not the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
...!
Marshall:
However, in the report that was finally submitted, that possibility had been erased.
Phoenix:
(Could the facts have been concealed with forged evidence...?)
Marshall:
That case left behind scars on all of us.
Ema:
The "scars" that the SL-9 Incident left behind...
Prosecutor Marshall
Marshall:
I got the looks, but he got the brains. He was one of the best prosecutors around. I had just made detective when it went down. It was our first case together...
Ema:
How old was he... your brother?
Marshall:
He was 27 at the time. He was awarded the highest honor that very day.
Phoenix:
The... "highest honor"? You don't mean...
Marshall:
King of Prosecutors.
Phoenix:
(Not that again...)
Marshall:
What are you looking at me like that for? That's an honor for a prosecutor!
Phoenix:
(Mr. Marshall must have really been close with his brother.)
Ema:
The day the SL-9 Incident took place, that wasn't the same day as...
Marshall:
That's right. It was the day of the evidence transferal.
Phoenix:
...! Interesting...
Marshall:
It was drizzling that morning, and by nightfall there was thunder. I can't believe two years have gone by already. I tried to steal the evidence so the case wouldn't die.
Phoenix:
(Apparently someone tried to stop you. Detective Goodman was murdered... and the evidence locker was empty.)
Scars (appears after Darke trial)
Marshall:
There was something going on behind the scenes in that case. We all knew that later. Every detective involved in that investigation, save one, was... taken care of. Ms. Starr was fired and I was demoted and boxed away in a tiny room.
Phoenix:
What about Detective Goodman?
Marshall:
If they did something to him too, the commissioners would get suspicious. No, they were careful enough not to be too obvious.
Phoenix:
"They"...?
Ema:
Who are you talking about!?
Marshall:
Don't get upset, Bambina. I mean Damon Gant... and Lana Skye.
Gant &amp; Skye (appears after Scars)
Marshall:
Chief Detective Damon Gant and his second-in-command, Lana Skye... There wasn't a person on the force who hadn't heard of that duo. That case was the biggest step in both of their careers.
Phoenix:
After the case ended, Lana transferred to the Prosecutor's Office, right?
Marshall:
Yeah. Damon Gant, the new Chief of Police, arranged for that to happen. She's never been the same since she left.
Ema:
?
Marshall:
Everyone who knew her said so. "Chief Prosecutor Skye was totally different when she was a detective."
Phoenix:
(Now that he mentions it, Ema said something like that too...)
Ema:
Tell me... what happened to my sister!
Marshall:
Sorry, Bambina, but her secret is too well guarded. I never found out.
Phoenix:
(Lana's "secret"... It all started two years ago.)
Present
Anything
Ema:
Mr. Marshall! Could you please have a look at this?
Marshall:
Sorry, Bambina. I'm not a patrolman anymore, and I'm certainly not a detective. I'm nothing more than a wanted man, now. These old eyes of mine have seen too much as it is.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Marshall:
So there you have it. That's my story. Did you enjoy it, pardner?
Phoenix:
It was certainly... enlightening.
Marshall:
There's one thing for sure I found out in court today. That boy Edgeworth isn't my enemy. He was the one who used falsified evidence to get a guilty verdict, but someone else was the one who gave him that evidence and planned everything. That someone is Damon Gant. Don't believe me? Well I don't blame you. I won't even be a patrolman after today. Too bad I won't be around to work with you... when you become a real scientific investigator. Adios Bambina!
February 24Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs
Phoenix:
I don't see Detective Gumshoe anywhere.
Ema:
Things seem kinda quiet around here today.
Phoenix:
You're right. (The head of the department seems the same though.)
Ema:
Why don't we go look for some other people to talk to?
Phoenix:
Right. We can come back here later.
Examine
Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"That's it! The villain used a time machine! Very clever indeed... That would explain the alibi! The future might not be so far away after all!"
Phoenix:
... He's not writing a report... he's writing a novel.
Chief
Phoenix:
That man must be the Head Detective. He's staring at the screen so hard it might shatter.
Chief:
What!? "Darke Case May Have Been Fabricated." That's what I thought all along... I just never bothered to tell anyone.
Phoenix:
(Now there's a guy who cares about his work...)
Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Talk
SL9 Incident
Ema:
It happened two years ago... It was right about this time of the year, too. There was a terrible thunder storm that day... Unusual for the season. I was alone in my sister's office. We were planning to eat dinner together once she finished her work. Then suddenly... This terrifying man came bursting into the office!
Phoenix:
Joe Darke...
Ema:
It seemed like he was running from someone. He pulled out a knife and screamed at me. I didn't know what was going on. Just then, Prosecutor Marshall showed up.
Phoenix:
(Jake Marshall's brother...)
Ema:
Joe Darke tried to take me hostage, but before he could... Mr. Marshall tackled him. Then...
Phoenix:
What happened?
Ema:
I-I'll never forget it! Lightning struck, and the lights went out. Suddenly... a bolt of lightning flashed outside the window, lighting up the office for an instant. What I saw then burned a permanent picture in my mind. I... I can still see it now...
Phoenix:
(A permanent picture...?)
After the incident
Ema:
I don't remember the moment when Darke stabbed Mr. Marshall.
Phoenix:
So you weren't able to testify about that? No, I was only asked about when I was attacked. That must be why Lana... why she "made up" the crime.
Phoenix:
Made it up? You mean, provided bogus evidence?
Ema:
The Prosecutor's Office wanted that guilty verdict so badly. Lana forged the evidence, and Mr. Edgeworth used it...
Phoenix:
Edgeworth!?
Ema:
Yes. But I'm sure he didn't know anything about it! He couldn't have known he was being given false evidence. Even so... that's when it all started. The rumors about Mr. Edgeworth, I mean. It's all my fault... If I could have just testified properly, none of this would have happened!
Phoenix:
(So it's true. Even though he may not have known it... Edgeworth really was involved in falsifying evidence!)
Ema:
After that case ended, Lana was never the same. She became cold, like she is today.
Phoenix:
(She must not have been able to face up to what she did... Especially not to Ema.)
Permanent picture (appears after SL9 Incident)
Phoenix:
What did you see in the instant that crime occurred?
Ema:
... Darke knocked down Mr. Marshall and raised his knife.
Phoenix:
(Neil Marshall was stabbed right in front of this poor girl!)
Ema:
I don't remember what happened after that. Apparently I passed out. When I came to, Lana was cradling me in her arms.
Phoenix:
Poor Ema... You've been through so much.
Ema:
I-I couldn't bring myself to testify about that instant. I tried, but the words just wouldn't come out. I drew a picture, but it wasn't any good.
Phoenix:
Two years ago... You must have been 14. That's understandable.
Ema:
Once it was all over... I made up my mind. I decided that when I grew up, I'd become a scientific investigator. I want to be able to fight crime with my testimonies! And find the evidence to make an airtight case... That way, Lana would never have to forge any.
Phoenix:
I see... (I think I'm finally starting to understand what makes Ema tick. But there's still something that bothers me about that crime.)
Something puzzling (appears after After the incident and Permanent picture)
Phoenix:
There's something that's puzzling me, Ema.
Ema:
What is it?
Phoenix:
You said you were in Lana's office at that time, right?
Ema:
That's right.
Phoenix:
Why then would a serial killer come running in there?
Phoenix:
Not only that, but he was being chased by a prosecutor?
Ema:
Oh, there's no mystery there. Joe Darke had been taken in for questioning that day.
Phoenix:
Taken in for questioning? You mean by the police?
Ema:
Of course. This happened at the Police Department. He tried to run away halfway through the interview, and fled into my sister's office.
Phoenix:
But why did he run all the way over to your sister's office?
Ema:
Because the detective offices and the questioning room are right across from the elevator.
Phoenix:
... Across from the elevator? But Lana was the Chief Prosecutor, wasn't she?
Ema:
No, silly! Didn't I tell you? Two years ago... Lana was a detective. She was the best in the entire force!
Phoenix:
Whaaaaat!? (That's news to me!)
Ema:
After the Joe Darke case, she was transferred to the Prosecutor's Office and made Chief Prosecutor.
Phoenix:
(Lana used to be... a detective? I'd better have another talk with her!)

Mr. Wright. It seems I keep causing you trouble.
Phoenix:
Falsifying evidence... I didn't think you were the type.
Lana:
Criminals don't mind playing foul, why should we?
Ema:
But Lana! If you're wrong... an innocent person might be found guilty!
Lana:
Believe me... I understand the risks.
Phoenix:
Lana. Ema told me about you.
Lana:
Oh?
Phoenix:
About how you were a detective two years ago, and how the SL-9 Incident was the reason for your transfer to the Prosecutor's Office.
Lana:
That's right.
Phoenix:
Could you fill me in on the details? Especially about that unusual change of jobs.
Lana:
... I suppose you have a right to know, Mr. Wright.
Examine

Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in place, cowering under this room's oppressive atmosphere.

Anything
Lana:
Attorneys and prosecutors have no business showing evidence outside court. It's taboo. Especially when the interests of both parties are involved.
Phoenix:
(She really means it...)
Ema:
Lana...
Talk
Today's trial
Phoenix:
A lot of revelations were uncovered at the trial today, not the least of which was the fact that this case is largely connected to another one, two years ago.
Lana:
Evidence from that case was stolen... I expected as much. I know how obsessive Officer Marshall can be.
Ema:
That trial... it really wasn't "fair," was it?
Lana:
...
Ema:
I believed in you, Lana! I believed that no matter what happened, you'd always stick to the truth!
Lana:
It couldn't be helped, Ema. At that trial two years ago... I sold my soul.
Phoenix:
Well, all drama aside, the fact of the matter is at 5:15, there was no murder at the Police Department.
Ema:
Tell me it's not true, Lana! What the witness... Ms. Starr said! About you stabbing Mr. Goodman with a knife!
Lana:
...
Ema:
Lana! I don't understand! Why won't you tell us?
Lana:
Ema... This doesn't involve just me.
Phoenix:
(I don't think I've ever seen Lana look so fazed before...)
Detective Lana Skye
Lana:
It's true. I was a member of the police force two years ago.
Ema:
She was amazing! They still talk about all the cases she and Chief Gant cracked together!
Phoenix:
Chief Gant?
Lana:
Then he was the Vice-Head of Criminal Affairs, but he still worked the crime scenes. Damon Gant... he was everything I aspired to be.
Ema:
They were the best team ever! They solved crimes before the reports could even be filed!
Phoenix:
(Ema really idolizes her big sister.) But now you're Chief Prosecutor... What happened?
Lana:
I always planned on becoming a prosecutor. The reason I became a detective was...
Ema:
to gain experience investigating crime scenes, so you could later use that experience in court.
Lana:
Gant's help in the SL-9 case was critical in its resolution. After that, he became Chief of Police, and arranged my transfer to the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
(Maybe I should ask more about this "investigation" of theirs two years ago.)
Darke investigation (appears after Today's trial)
Lana:
Two years ago I was second-in- command of the detectives investigating Darke.
Phoenix:
"Second-in-command"? That means the Chief Detective was, no doubt, Damon Gant?
Lana:
Yes. Detective Gant and I shared the same office, and the same investigations.
Phoenix:
(They even had the same office...!)
Lana:
We led a team of the best detectives on the force: Detective Goodman, whose case it was, Jake Marshall and Angel Starr. It was the first time Marshall worked with his brother. He was quite... "gung ho." Without a doubt, Joe Darke was the serial killer. We asked him to come in for questioning. We were desperate for evidence. That was when the last murder took place.
Phoenix:
(When he tried to murder Ema...)
Ema:
Prosecutor Marshall was trying to save me from Darke...
Lana:
You see, the first person who happened upon the scene of the crime... was me.
Phoenix:
...! (Now you tell us...)
First one at scene (appears after Darke investigation)
Lana:
Detective Gant and Prosecutor Marshall were the ones questioning Darke that day. The investigation was in its final stages, when Darke must have panicked. He waited until Gant and Marshall let their guards down, then fled the room. From there, he ran straight to... the office shared by Detective Gant and myself.
Ema:
That's where he found me.
Phoenix:
So you were the first person to run to the scene, Lana?
Lana:
It appears so. I was filing some papers while Gant and Marshall were questioning Darke. When I returned to my office, I saw three bodies on the floor and smelled blood.
Phoenix:
Three bodies? Prosecutor Marshall, the victim, Ema, who had passed out,
Lana:
and the suspect, Joe Darke. During the struggle, it seems Mr. Marshall stuck a final blow before he died. Joe Darke had incurred a minor concussion, and lay unconscious.
Phoenix:
What did you do?
Lana:
To be honest, I panicked. I picked up Ema, carried her out of the room and just held her.
Phoenix:
(Can't blame her, after all her sister must have gone through.)
Lana:
After that, I placed Darke under immediate arrest.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Phoenix:
Let me get this straight. You were all involved in the SL-9 Incident?
Lana:
That's right. Quite a coincidence, hmm?
Phoenix:
I don't buy it.
Ema:
W-what are you saying?
Phoenix:
There's no way everyone involved in this trial was also involved in that incident just by "chance."
Ema:
But that case was solved two years ago!
Phoenix:
At least one person went to extremes because they didn't believe it was truly solved.
Lana:
Officer Marshall... Yes, his actions came as a surprise to me as well. Ever since his brother died, he's changed completely.
Ema:
I guess he wasn't convinced with the ruling against Joe Darke.
Lana:
... Life doesn't end with the closing of a case. Everyone has to live the rest of their lives with their memories.
Phoenix:
That "case" just might not be over yet.
Lana:!
Phoenix:
Ema was assaulted by Darke at the Police Department, right?
Lana:
Yes, in the office that Damon Gant and I shared. The office that Mr. Gant now occupies by himself: the Chief's office.
Phoenix:
(Maybe we should have a look at the Chief's office - the site of the final SL-9 murder!)

Oh, if you're looking for the others, they're all in the conference room.
Phoenix:
Uh... thanks. (Wow, he actually talked to us!)
Chief:
With the Chief Prosecutor saying what she did and the decision about what to do about Mr. Edgeworth, not to mention our statement to the media and tomorrow's trial... there's more chaos going on than Thanksgiving and Christmas put together!
Phoenix:
(I think "festive" is the word usually used for those...)
Ema:
Um, sir? We'd like to have a look around for Chief Gant's office.
Chief:
Just head across the hall to the other building and take the elevator to the top floor.
Ema:
Really? You mean, it's okay for us to go in there? I mean, we aren't police officers or anything.
Chief:
Hey, you're right! You can't go in there! It's off limits!
Phoenix:
(Now I see where Detective Gumshoe gets his unique charm...)
Ema:
Well, what are wating for? Let's head to the Chief's office!

Whoa... Where am I?
Ema:
In the Chief's office, silly! At least, that's what it said on the door.
Phoenix:
Check out that pipe organ. That's real, isn't it?
Ema:
Hey, I used to take organ lessons in kindergarten! They used to call me "Little Miss Bach." I thought I was a genius until they tried teaching me notes. I never could remember where C was...
Gant:
Hm? Oh, it's you two.
Phoenix:
Chief Gant! (He put that paper he was reading in his desk.)
Gant:
So, Mr. Wright. Have you been swimming lately?
Phoenix:
Uh... no, I haven't. I've been kind of busy lately.
Gant:
I can appreciate that. I've had my hands full too, with Mr. Marshall's misconduct and Lana's provocative statement.
Phoenix:
"Provocative statement"... oh, you mean about the forged evidence.
Gant:
Two years have passed since that incident. My, how time flies! See that big picture on the wall over there? That's a picture of Lana, Neil and me.
Phoenix:
(So this is Mr. Marshall's brother... Prosecutor Neil Marshall...)
Gant:
We took it to commemorate our work together.
Phoenix:...
(Something's not right with this picture. I can't quite seem to put my finger on it though...)
Gant Team Picture added to the Court Record.
Gant:
Anyway, I'd like to reminisce all day, but there are matters that need my attention. I'm going to lock up here, so let's go out together.
Ema:
Oh... But this office... it was a crime scene two years ago, wasn't it?
Gant:
That case has long since been over. There's no need to investigate it any more.
Phoenix:
All the same, we'd still like to have a look around.
Gant:
Perhaps you didn't hear me. I said there's no need to investigate it any more.
Phoenix:
...!
Gant:
Now hurry up and get out. I have a meeting to attend.
Police Dept. Entrance
Ema:
Looks like we aren't welcome.
Phoenix:
It seems that case isn't over with yet, after all.
Ema:
What do you mean?
Phoenix:
Chief Gant denied our request to search the "crime scene." That means there must be a reason he doesn't want us looking around in there.
Ema:
You mean like, a clue!?
Phoenix:
(There's got to be a way we can get inside the Chief's office...)

Gumshoe:
Hey, pal!
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! Were you in a meeting?
Gumshoe:
I was uh... just taking a breather. My feet hurt.
Ema:
From sitting so long in the meeting?
Gumshoe:
Actually... I had to serve everyone coffee.
Phoenix:
(Sounds like Detective Gumshoe's still out of the loop...)
Gumshoe:
Say, have either of you seen Mr. Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth? No. Why do you ask?
Gumshoe:
He's under fire from both the Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office. It's almost like the battles between you two in court!
Phoenix:
That sounds serious...
Ema:
Is it because of what my sister said?
Gumshoe:
That's basically what it all boils down to. That falsified evidence two years ago. Now Mr. Edgeworth has the whole world after his blood!
Ema:
Yikes...
Examine
Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"I got it! I'm the culprit! Very clever indeed... Who would have thought of multiple personalities? I don't see how else he could have done it. I guess it's time to have my head checked."
Phoenix:
... I think it's way past time for that.
Chief
Phoenix:
That man must be the Head Detective. He's staring at the screen so hard it might shatter.
Chief:
What!? "Police Department Makes Fatal Error" What do I do!? Quick! Someone bring me the classifieds! Help Wanted section!!!
Phoenix:
(So much for "duty"...)
Talk
Edgeworth's crisis
Phoenix:
But why would Edgeworth be blamed? It's not like he knew the evidence was forged! Lana Skye is the guilty party here, isn't she?
Ema:
...
Gumshoe:
Regardless, the prosecutor is responsible for the evidence he presents in court. Not only that, but as you know there've been a lot of rumors going around about Mr. Edgeworth. Those who don't like him haven't been able to do anything because of his amazing talent as a prosecutor. But now with this...
Ema:
Are there really so many people who hate him?
Gumshoe:
In our world, only those with talent rise to the top. Mr. Edgeworth not only had that, but he's young. There's no better recipe I know of for making enemies.
Police:
Hey, Dick! Keep up the good work!
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!
Police:
Let's go out for lunch again sometime, my treat!
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!
Police:
You gotta take me back to that joint sometime, okay Dick?
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!
Phoenix:
It seems you don't have any problem with enemies.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, well... I'm careful not to stick out. Anyway, I'm a bit worried about him. Under all this pressure, I'm afraid Mr. Edgeworth just might crack.
SL9 Incident
Gumshoe:
Actually, I took a look at the file earlier, while the coffee was brewing.
Phoenix:
(He seems geniunely concerned for Edgeworth...) Well? Did you find out anything?
Gumshoe:
The only evidence Darke left behind was during his final attack.
Phoenix:
His final attack? You mean...
Gumshoe:
When he killed Prosecutor Marshall, who was trying to protect some girl.
Ema:
Me...
Phoenix:
(It seems Detective Gumshoe never realized Ema was the girl...)
Gumshoe:
That's when he left the most incriminating evidence of all.
Ema:
Well? What was it?
Gumshoe:
Oh, um, let's see... I think it had something to do with the murder weapon... ... Oh, I forget. Look, it's all written somewhere in here, okay?
Phoenix:
(His powers of recollection never fail to impress.)
Ema:
Maybe we should show him the murder weapon. It might jog his memory!
Darke's crimes (appears after SL9 Incident)
Gumshoe:
Joe Darke was 42 at the time of the crime. He was just your run-of-the-mill businessman.
Phoenix:
A businessman? What made him take to serial killing?
Gumshoe:
One day on his way home from work, he hit someone with his car.
Ema:
With his car? So... it was an accident?
Gumshoe:
An accident, yes. But it transformed him into an animal!
Ema:
An animal...
Gumshoe:
He killed a man that witnessed the accident. Then he killed a lady who saw the second crime. A kid walked by just then, so he killed him too. Then, when he was burying the bodies, a jogger came upon the scene and was killed as well! Finally he turned himself in.
Phoenix:
Seems he was a pretty careless animal.
Gumshoe:
Of course, this is all conjecture. There wasn't a single shred of evidence.
Phoenix:
So, he turned himself in...
Gumshoe:
Yes, but in the middle of his questioning, he fled and murdered his final victim... Prosecutor Marshall. That crime was witnessed by someone too, but fortunately he was arrested on the spot. It's a good thing that last witness wasn't killed.
Phoenix:
(That last "witness"... He must mean Ema...)
Murder weapon (appears after presenting Switchblade Knife)
Phoenix:
This knife... it was Joe Darke's, wasn't it?
Gumshoe:
That's right. We traced it back to the store he bought it at, and it had his fingerprints on it too.
Ema:
But no one actually witnessed him using it to murder anyone, right?
Gumshoe:
That's where his luck ran out. When you take a good look at the knife... you'll see it's broken!
Ema:
You don't have to take a good look to notice that.
Gumshoe:
... Yeah, well anyway! Take a guess where the broken- off tip of the knife was found. That's what did him in!
Ema:
Where was it?
Gumshoe:
The victim, Neil Marshall was carrying it... inside his own body!
Phoenix:!
Gumshoe:
It was found deep inside the stab wound.
Phoenix:
Did it match Darke's knife?
Gumshoe:
You bet. Down to the last fiber.
Ema:
That's pretty... conclusive.
Neil's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Switchblade Knife added to the Court Record.
Present
Goodman's ID
Gumshoe:
This ID card belongs to the victim, Detective Bruce Goodman. You can do just about anything these days with a card and a secret number... scary!
Phoenix:
It's only scary because you keep dropping your card, Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
I forget my secret number a lot, too. I'm scared of myself! But... but I'm me, after all! And what could be wrong with that!?
Phoenix:
(I think I'll stay out of this conversation.)
Prosecutor Trophy
Gumshoe:
Hey, that's it! That's the "King of Prosecutors" award that Mr. Edgeworth got the other day!
Phoenix:
Were you at the awards ceremony, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Of course, pal! I got an award for diligence, myself.
Phoenix:
Ah... congratulations.
Ema:
I was wondering, why is the award a shield? And... why is it broken?
Gumshoe:
Oh, there's a reason. Erm... I'll tell you what it is later.
Phoenix:
(Apparently, he's forgotten.)
Blue Badger Panel
Phoenix:
This guy almost made us lose the case today.
Gumshoe:
What are you talking about!? He was guarding the bloodstain on that evidence locker with his life! That's more than you can say for most officers nowadays!
Ema:
It would have saved us a lot of trouble if he hadn't guarded it so well.
Phoenix:
(I have to admit he's right though... Thanks to the Blue Badger, we were able to prove another possibility today: The possibility that another murder took place prior to 5:15 PM...)
Switchblade Knife
Phoenix:
Um, about this...
Gumshoe:
Hey! Don't tell me that's...
Phoenix:
It has a tag attached to it, with the label "SL-9 Incident" on it. I believe this would be the broken "murder weapon" you were speaking of?
Gumshoe:
What are you doing with that!? Ever since that case was closed, that knife's been locked away in a locker.
Ema:
On the day Detective Goodman was murdered, this suddenly disappeared from the locker, and was found in Mr. Edgeworth's car muffler.
Gumshoe:
... That's it! Now I remember what that incriminating piece of evidence was! When you showed me that knife, it all came back to me!
Ema:
Well, what is it, Detective? Quick! Before you forget again!
Luminol Testing Fluid
Gumshoe:
Hey, I just bought some of that stuff! Now I can go around detecting blood traces too!
Ema:
Wow! Is that a new type? I've never seen that bottle before. "Add three inches to your base height."
Phoenix:
"Base height"? Hey, let me see that! "Looming Tall." "New and improved growth formula."
Gumshoe:
You mean this can't detect any blood traces!?
Ema:
Uh, well... It's not quite the same thing as luminol.
Gumshoe:
So that's why the lady at the counter had that smirk on her face...
ID Card Record
Gumshoe:
That's the ID card record, isn't it?
Phoenix:
Yes. There's only one number left to investigate. At 4:20 PM... the victim, Detective Goodman, must have entered the evidence room along with someone else. Someone with an "executive officer" number:
Gumshoe:
"Sevensevensevensevensevensevensevenseven"?
Phoenix:
That's one "seven" too many, Detective. (An executive officer. Hmm... I just might have a hunch.)
Fingerprinting Set
Gumshoe:
Hey, that powder's used for detecting fingerprints.
Ema:
Yeah, Mr. Edgeworth gave it to us.
Gumshoe:
He did what!? All I have is some flour... ...
Phoenix:
Are you okay, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Quick! RUN!!! AHH-CHOOOO!!!
Phoenix:
...
Gumshoe:
... If it's any help, one time I took a nap on a bench with wet paint.
Phoenix:
(Why am I not comforted?)
Goodman's Lost Item Report
Gumshoe:
Oh, a lost item report, huh?
Ema:
Very impressive, detective! You knew what is was right off the bat!
Gumshoe:
Well, I am a master of misplacement, you know.
Ema:
"Master"... That has such a cool ring to it!
Gumshoe:
The way I see it, if things are meant to be lost, then they're meant to be lost. There's a higher power at work here.
Ema:
Wow, a higher power...
Phoenix:
(Maybe I shouldn't let Ema hold any evidence...)
Evidence Locker
Gumshoe:
No locker can be opened without a fingerprint match. Besides... There's no reason for the murderer to touch his own locker...
Ema:
Hey, wasn't your locker the one with the blood on it, Detective?
Phoenix:
(The handprint of the real murderer's gloved hand... without any fingerprints...)
Gumshoe:
SSH! If they come to arrest me, you'll defend me, won't you!?
Phoenix:
If that happens, I think you'll do better pleading with Edgeworth.
Unstable Jar
Gumshoe:
About that jar... I think I've seen it before somewhere.
Phoenix:
"Somewhere"?
Gumshoe:
Or maybe it's one of those memories people have from "previous lives."
Phoenix:
(This must be the most uninformative detective I've ever met...)
Gumshoe:
Something about it makes me feel uneasy. It's like I'm in the Chief's office, and he's yelling at me.
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant?)
Gumshoe:
Where could I have seen that before...?
Marshall's Prints
Gumshoe:
I can't believe Officer Marshall would do something like that...
Ema:
You know Officer Marshall?
Gumshoe:
Of course I do! He was like a mentor to me! When I first started out, he even gave me a small cactus.
Ema:
Really?
Gumshoe:
He said, "Dick, she'll listen to all your troubles."
Ema:
Note to self: Detective Gumshoe talks to a cactus...
Gumshoe:
Hard to believe he's just a "patrolman" now. Someone oughta trade places with him! ... What? Why are you looking at me like that?
SL-9 Incident Files
Gumshoe:
I've been studying up on those Files. There's nothing wrong with Mr. Edgeworth's presentation. To think people are accusing him of injustice... I for one ain't buyin' it, pal!
Ema:
You're looking into the case for Mr. Edgeworth?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. It was a pretty big deal while it was going on, you know. After all, a serial killer was on the loose!
Phoenix:
(But Lana was pretty clear in her confession. She forged evidence in order to prove Joe Darke guilty.)
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Let me share a little advice with you as a detective. If you don't have a clue, keep yer trap shut!
Phoenix:
I'll, uh, keep that in mind.
Gumshoe:
Sheesh!
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Gumshoe:
Well, there you have it in a nutshell. That's all I know.
Phoenix:
Can I ask you one more thing?
Gumshoe:
What is it? If it's money you need, you should ask Chief Gant.
Phoenix:
It's not money, but it does concern the Chief. His office is a "crime scene," right? It's where Prosecutor Neil Marshall was murdered...
Ema:
The Chief's out now, and his office is locked, but we'd like to have a look around if that's okay.
Gumshoe:
... Well, any Detective's ID card can unlock the door.
Ema:
What? Really!?
Gumshoe:
But if I let a civilian in there, I'd be charged with breach of trust.
Ema:
Breach of trust...?
Gumshoe:
Simply put, I'd be canned.
Phoenix:
Oh...
Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal. I don't plan on getting fired because of you.
Ema:
How about this ID card? It was Detective Goodman's...
Gumshoe:
That won't work either. The data was deleted the day he died.
Ema:
Oh.
Phoenix:
(So in other words, Gumshoe is our only chance of getting into that office.)
Ema:
I wonder if there's something we could show him that would make him change his mind...

Trophy
Ema:
He won such a prestigious award. Why would he just leave it on the couch?
Phoenix:
Better this than that giant Steel Samurai.
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
What is it?
Ema:
This is the "King of Prosecutors" award, right?
Phoenix:
Of course it is. You know that!
Ema:
I saw something today that looked like this, somewhere...
Phoenix:
Something that looked like that?
Ema:
Yeah, only different. What was it...?
Phoenix:
(She's right. Something's amiss here. Maybe I should show him a certain item...)
Crumpled paper
Phoenix:
(I wonder what he was writing before?)
Ema:
Come on, Mr. Wright! Let's take a look!
Phoenix:
Are you crazy? Edgeworth is sitting right there!
Ema:
Just distract him. I'll check it out.
Phoenix:
Uh... Hey, Edgeworth. Is that Detective Gumshoe out the window there? Oh no! He's falling to the ground!!!
Edgeworth:
Hold on. First let me see what this girl's doing crawling around my feet.
Phoenix:
(He didn't even look.)
Ema:
What!? "Letter of r-r-r-r..."
Edgeworth:
If you can't read, I'll read it for you. It says, "Letter of Resignation."
Phoenix:
"Resignation"!? Edgeworth, you don't mean...?
Edgeworth:
I'm tired, Mr. Wright. I feel as if... something inside me has died.
Ema:
But Mr. Edgeworth! None of it is your fault!
Edgeworth:
I know the path I've walked. You don't need to tell me. And the path I've walked... hasn't been a just one. I can't forgive myself for what I've done... and no one else should forgive me either.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. I think he's serious!)
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Please, you have to do something!
Phoenix:
(This Letter of Resignation... I wonder if I can use it for anything?)
Put Letter of Resignation in pocket.
Talk
Forged evidence
Edgeworth:
There's no excuse for what I've done. Two years ago, I used false evidence to obtain a guilty verdict. That's what it all breaks down to, and nothing I do can erase that fact.
Phoenix:
But you didn't know, did you? I mean, that the evidence was falsified.
Edgeworth:
The Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office share a bond of trust. If that bond is broken, we stand to lose everything. The Police Department's error is my error, my responsibility as the prosecutor in charge. That fact remains the same no matter what excuses I might have.
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
I take pride in my work. So tell me why! Why has it all come to this...
Phoenix:
(Even Edgeworth can't keep this kind of emotion bottled up...)
Tomorrow's trial
Phoenix:
Are you up for the trial tomorrow?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. First last year's trial, and now this one. It seems all you do is worry about me. To be honest, you're getting on my nerves.
Ema:
But Mr. Edgeworth! You can't just walk out on the trial...
Edgeworth:
Tomorrow is the last day. It's too late to change prosecutors. I'll bet that's what my superiors are banking on. I never thought that case would come back to haunt me like this.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
That list of evidence. It seems too short. Most lists... run twice as long.
Phoenix:
It's only half as long as most lists? (That is odd...)
Edgeworth:
After Neil Marshall was murdered, I became prosecutor for that case. I may not have been part of the investigation, but at the time there was only one thing on my mind: I'd use the evidence I was given to prove the suspect guilty!
Ema:
Say, we just saw a picture taken around that time.
Phoenix:
(That picture... Something seemed strange about it...)
The day of the crime
Phoenix:
Could you tell us again about what happened that day? The day Detective Goodman was murdered? You were participating in a ceremony over at the station, right?
Edgeworth:
I've never cared for ceremonies, but I had to attend that one.
Ema:
Because you were awarded this?
Edgeworth:
Those receiving awards can't exactly skip out on the ceremony. I finished up at the office in the morning, then drove over to the Police Department.
Phoenix:
You, "finished up" at the office?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Just odds and ends- clerical stuff. I didn't plan on returning to the office that day. That is, until I was asked to take something back.
Ema:
Take something back?
Edgeworth:
This.
Ema:
Oh yeah. Chief Gant asked you to hold onto that, didn't he?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It was a piece of evidence in a case that was closed half a year ago. He asked me to bring it back to the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
(That's the story we heard yesterday...) So you came back here to the Prosecutor's Office because the Chief asked you to?
Edgeworth:
That's right.
Phoenix:
...
Prosecutor trophy (appears after presenting Gant Team Picture)
Edgeworth:
This award originates from an ancient Chinese tale. In Chinese, the word "contradiction" is written with two characters: the first means "halberd," and the second means "shield." Have you heard this story?
Phoenix:
Me? Oh, uh... sure. Everyone knows that! Why don't you tell it though... for Ema's sake.
Edgeworth:
Very well. Long ago in the kingdom of Chu, there was an arms merchant. One day, he presented the king with two items. The first was a halberd he claimed could slice through any shield or armor. The second was a shield he claimed could withstand any weapon.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Wait a minute.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Those claims contradict each other!
Edgeworth:
Very perceptive. But then again, you've heard this story before, right? Anyway, as you mentioned, the very descriptions of these items discredit them both. When the king pointed this out, the merchant was left speechless. And thus, the Chinese word for "contradiction" was born.
Ema:
Oh, I see! So the "chipped shield" and the "broken knife" symbolize...
Edgeworth:
Precisely so. They symbolize the merchant's items. The ancient tale ends with the merchant at a loss for words, but it's in our nature to pursue matters to their conclusion... even if it results in something as ugly as this.
Ema:
Wow. Thanks, Mr. Edgeworth! I learned something new today!
Phoenix:
That's funny... If that's so, then why were you only given a shield?
Edgeworth:
... You'll have to ask Chief Gant. Two years ago, he had the "halberd" part of the award abolished.
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant...)
King of Prosecutors Trophy updated in the Court Record.

Attorney's Badge
Edgeworth:
I once dreamed of being a defense attorney, a long time ago.
Ema:
What? You wanted to be a defense attorney, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Yet, a clear path is laid out before me. I have no time to look back on what might have been.
Prosecutor Trophy
Phoenix:
You know, it wouldn't hurt if you put this up somewhere, like on a shelf.
Edgeworth:
That has no meaning for me anymore.
Phoenix:
What do you mean, "anymore"?
Edgeworth:
That's who I was last year. What good is it to dwell on the past?
Phoenix:
He's asking me?
Ema:
That makes me kind of mad. Actually, something's been troubling me about this shield. Look... Do you notice anything different?
Phoenix:
Different...?
Ema:
Yeah, don't you remember? The other shield in the Court Record?
Phoenix:
(I guess I'd better present this other shield...)
ID Card Record or Evidence Locker
Edgeworth:
It seems everything in this case is designed to cast doubt on me.
Phoenix:
Hey, don't look at me.
Edgeworth:
Yes, I went into the evidence room on the day of the crime. Chief Gant asked me to do something.
Ema:
To take evidence from a case solved six months ago back to the Prosecutor's Office...
Edgeworth:
I have a locker in there as well.
Phoenix:
Did you notice anything amiss when you were in the evidence room?
Edgeworth:
That room's always dark and I was in a hurry. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary.
Screwdriver
Edgeworth:
... Come now, Mr. Wright. You can't seriously expect me to just sit down... and chat with you about the case over a cup of tea.
Phoenix:
But this isn't related to the case, remember? You said so yourself.
Edgeworth:
So I did...
Ema:
Chief Gant gave this to you that day, didn't he? He asked you to bring it here from the Police Department...
Edgeworth:
The Chief is a very competent man... but sometimes he does things that don't make any sense. ... At least it's better than being incompetent and doing things that don't make sense.
Phoenix:
(A certain detective comes to mind...)
Gant Team Picture
Phoenix:
This picture was hanging on the wall in Chief Gant's office.
Edgeworth:
Prosecutor Neil Marshall... He had just started making a name for himself. Looks like this was taken when he received the King of Prosecutors trophy.
Ema:
Speaking of that, there's something that bothers me.
Edgeworth:
Yes?
Ema:
The trophy Mr. Marshall is holding... it's a little different than yours.
Edgeworth:
Yes, you're right. ... I remember now.
Phoenix:
Remember what?
Edgeworth:
That was the official prosecutor trophy used until that time. There's a story behind it.
Ema:
A story?
Phoenix:
(Sounds interesting.) Would you mind telling it to us?
Edgeworth:
It's simple, really. "Contradiction." That's what the award's based on.
Letter of Resignation
Edgeworth:
They say where there's smoke, there's fire. Apparently I was so caught up in the smoke, I lost sight of the truth.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
The others are right. I have no right to serve as a prosecutor.
Ema:
But Mr. Edgeworth! You were only doing your job!
Edgeworth:
I've always made my own decisions about what I can or cannot do. That hasn't changed. Forgiving myself... is something I cannot do.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. I think he's serious!)
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Please, you have to do something!
Phoenix:
(This Letter of Resignation... I wonder if I can use it for anything?)
Anything else
Edgeworth:
... Wright, please. I'm the prosecutor on this case! You don't expect me to sit here and discuss the case with you over a cup of tea!
Phoenix:
I'll pass on the tea. Just tell me about the case...
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Mr. Edgeworth just told you "no" in a very stylish manner!
Phoenix:
(Whoose side are you on, anyway? Maybe if I just show him my best evidence I can get some reaction out of him.)
Examine evidence
Text of Letter of Resignation
Ema:
"Due to recent events I hereby announce my resignation as public prosecutor."
Phoenix:
(He really wrote a resignation letter...)
Ema:
Wow! Even when resigning, Mr. Edgeworth is cool and concise! Still, it wasn't his fault...
Phoenix:
Someone has to be held responsible. That's how it is in the grown-up world.
Ema:
Yeah, but that responsibility means nothing if he just quits!
Phoenix:
Well, not everyone sees it that way.
Ema:
To truly take responsibility you should have to work the rest of your life for no pay.

???:
Excuse me...
Angel:
Would either of you care for a quarter pound of roast beef?
Phoenix:
Ms. Starr! (I guess she's out of lunches.)
Angel:
You certainly are the curious sort, aren't you? Kind of like the first person who sucked a cow's nipple to discover milk. Still, I never thought you'd go digging up that case from two years ago.
Phoenix:
Everyone in this trial was involved in the SL-9 Incident. Not only that, but the murder occurred on the very day the evidence from that case was due for transferal. This can't all be attributed to mere "coincidence."
Angel:
... Aren't you forgetting something? You know, that little scene I happened to witness?
Phoenix:
(The instant Lana stabbed Detective Goodman with a knife.)
Angel:
No matter how much of the past you dig up, it won't change what I saw. Roast beef is meant to be savored when eaten.
Phoenix:
(Ms. Starr's hatred toward Lana... It all dates back to two years ago!)
Talk
Darke investigation
Angel:
Joe Darke... That's a name I'll not soon forget! We trailed him for half a year. Oh, the pressure! Still, I don't think I was ever more alive than I was then. Those days were steamier than a bowl of hot gravy! Poor old Jake Marshall, though, must have been going through hell.
Phoenix:
You mean, because of his brother's death?
Angel:
They were close, those two. After Neil died, something took over Jake. He became obsessed. Seeing Jake like that made her all the more desperate.
Phoenix:
"Her"...?
Angel:
Lana Skye.
Ema:
My sister...?
Angel:
The best of the best were put on that SL-9 case. Of course they were lead by that legendary duo.
Ema:
Lana... and Chief Gant!
After case closed
Angel:
That legendary pair was the reason we were able to keep up our investigation. That's why we're so shocked over how it turned out...
Phoenix:
You mean, with the forging of the evidence?
Angel:
Don't get me wrong. Joe Darke got what he deserved. Still, it was obvious the evidence produced in court was being manipulated. Items our team never found would suddenly appear, while other items were kept secret.
Ema:
But you didn't have proof anything illegal was done...
Angel:
I'm proof enough of what happened.
Ema:!
Angel:
After that case, all of us save Goodman were relieved of our duties... most without even so much as an explanation. Then Lana Skye transferred to the Prosecutor's Office and became Chief Prosecutor.
Ema:
Lana always wanted to be a prosecutor.
Angel:
Nothing's quite as simple as it appears.
Ema:
Huh?
Angel:
Lana Skye was merely being used as a pawn. That's my take on the matter.
Phoenix:
She was being used?
Legendary duo (appears after Darke investigation)
Angel:
Damon Gant and Lana Skye... Two years ago Gant was Chief Detective, and Lana second in command. They were the best.
Ema:
They solved all kinds of cases together, didn't they?
Angel:
Damon Gant's magnetism in particular was almost unreal.
Phoenix:
His "magnetism"?
Angel:
By that I mean his ability to attract evidence. He'd produce the most incredible evidence in the cases he handled.
Phoenix:
("Incredible evidence"? You mean...)
Angel:
Oh, yes. There were rumors about him even back then. No one dared confront him, though.
Phoenix:
(I take it she's talking about forged evidence.)
Angel:
Back then, everyone looked up to Lana. All the detectives wanted to be like her.
Ema:! Really?
Angel:
Oh yes... myself included. I was a fool, really. She hated anything crooked, and always watched out for the other detectives. That's why she was so concerned for Jake.
Ema:
Mr. Marshall...
Angel:
When Jake's brother was murdered, she felt as if she had lost her own brother. If it wasn't for her, I don't think Jake would ever have recovered from his shock. That's what makes it all the more infuriating.
Ema:
Ms. Starr...
Angel:
That's why... I'll never be able to forgive her. Why did she have to turn so cold after that...?
Ema:
...
Being "used" (appears after After case closed)
Phoenix:
Lana transferred to the Prosecutor's Office two years ago, didn't she?
Angel:
Yes, thanks to "Chief" Gant's powerful influence.
Ema:
Chief...
Angel:
That's right. Having solved the SL-9 case, his position as chief was secured. There was only one thing left for him to control, and then no one could stand in his way: the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
What? You mean... That's why Lana was transferred!?
Angel:
If he could control the Chief Prosecutor, he could control the Prosecutor's Office. That must have been his goal all along.
Ema:
B-but how could he control Lana?
Angel:
I don't know, but one thing's for sure. Ever since that case ended, she's never been the same. It's only logical to conclude... there must have been a reason for her change.
Phoenix:
(At last... I'm finally getting close to the bottom of this ugly mess.) Thank you, Ms. Starr.
Angel:
You listen to me, Rookie. It takes more than just ingredients to create fine cuisine. I hope you turn out to be a better chef than I've been...
Present
Anything
Angel:
I don't have anything else to tell you.
Ema:
Ms. Starr...
Angel:
The only thing I can give you now, is a poppyseed rice set.
Phoenix:
(Talk about cheap...)
Angel:
Eat this, and maybe you'll be able to tell black from white in court tomorrow.

Gumshoe:
Oh, you're back.
Phoenix:
You're still here?
Gumshoe:
I gotta make 150 copies of these files. Brewing coffee, copying files... I'm turning into a regular DJ!
Ema:
You're a "DJ" as well?
Phoenix:
If I'm not mistaken, I think he means "Desk Jockey."
Ema:
... Oh, that DJ...
Gumshoe:
I gotta admire your persistency, but my answer's still no.
Ema:
?
Gumshoe:
I'm not letting you in the Chief's office, period. It'd be my neck on the line.
Phoenix:
(That office is the last crime scene in the SL-9 Incident. I have to take a look in there!)
Ema:
There's got to be something we can do to make the Detective change his mind.
Examine
Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"Oh, Francesca. You're more lovely than a marsupial in... Quiet, Jean Marc. Words will just spoil the moment. Now hold me close..." Yes, this approach allows for much more intrigue.
Phoenix:
... It seems he's given up on the mystery genre.
Present
Prosecutor Trophy
Gumshoe:
Hey, that's it! That's the "King of Prosecutors" award that Mr. Edgeworth got the other day!
Phoenix:
Were you at the awards ceremony, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Of course, pal! I got an award for diligence, myself.
Phoenix:
Ah... congratulations.
Ema:
Say, this design's based on an old Chinese parable, right?
Gumshoe:
Uh, yeah! Everyone knows that! There was this, uh... dragon, yeah, that's it. A dragon! He had a thing for shields, see...?
Phoenix:
That's not exactly the version we heard.
Ema:
No, but this one sounds more exciting!
Gumshoe:
Anyway, it gets kind of gory after that. I'll spare you the details.
Letter of Resignation
Leads to:
"What's this crumpled up piece of paper?"
Gumshoe:
What's this crumpled up piece of paper? ...... N--no way! Mr. Edgeworth can't be serious!
Phoenix:
Is he ever not serious?
Gumshoe:
I can't believe they've pushed him this far...
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth really feels responsible.
Gumshoe:
At first I thought he was as cold as ice, but now I know different! He trusted us detectives to provide him with sound evidence, but we just... we betrayed him!
Ema:
Detective...
Gumshoe:
......... That's it. I've made up my mind!
Ema:
But...
Gumshoe:
Here, take my ID card.
Phoenix:
We can't do that. If someone found out...
Ema:
they wouldn't let you off the hook with another lost item report!
Gumshoe:
Look at me. It's no secret I'm already out of the loop. After all, I'm friends with Mr. Edgeworth. Depending on how this case turns out, I may already be as good as terminated...
Phoenix:
(What...?)
Gumshoe:
So at least let me do this... for Mr. Edgeworth's sake!
Phoenix:
All right, Detective. Thank you.
Gumshoe's ID tucked swiftly into your pocket.
Examine evidence
Identification on Gumshoe's ID
Ema:
Detective Gumshoe isn't very photogenic, is he?
Phoenix:
Whatever you do, just don't say that to his face.
Ema:
Look, his eyes are half shut!
Phoenix:
Yeah... and his mouth is half open.
Ema:
Hey! Each of his shirt buttons is off a notch!
Phoenix:
And he's got the narrow end of his tie in front. ... I think this goes beyond being a "photogenic" issue.

Ema:
Here goes, Mr. Wright.
*click*
*beep*
Ema:
Open sesame. If anyone finds us now,
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe's a goner.
Gumshoe:
If that happens, I'm counting on you to bail me out!
Ema:
EEEEEEEEK!
Gumshoe:
GAAAAAAAAH!
Ema:
Sorry, I thought you were a ghost.
Gumshoe:
I didn't even know you could slap a ghost.
Phoenix:
AAAAH! Detective Gumshoe! What are you doing sneaking up on us like that!?
Gumshoe:
I-I-I wasn't "sneaking." I was just worried something might go wrong... so I came too.
Phoenix:
If you're here, then what's the point in giving us your ID card!?
Crumpled Gumshoe's ID Card in pocket.
Gumshoe:
Hey, don't do that to my card!
Gumshoe:
I hardly ever get a chance to come in here, so I figured I'd have a look around myself! Besides, we're all in this together now.
Ema:
You really do want to get fired, don't you?
Gumshoe:
Not if we're lucky. Now come on, let's see what we can find out!
Phoenix:
(I've got a bad feeling about this...)
Examine (left side)
Left window
Gumshoe:
Look at that giant window... Makes you want to crash through it and jump outside.
Phoenix:
Uh, this is the 15th floor.
Gumshoe:
I know! I was just saying...
Phoenix:
(Saying what?)
Gumshoe:
Ever since making detective, I've always dreamed about doing something like that.
Ema:
Note to Self: Detective Gumshoe has a lot of dreams...
Phoenix:
So long as he doesn't go crashing through that window when he gets fired.
Ema:
Don't say that!
Shelves
Phoenix:
These shelves are mostly empty. Lana must have cleaned them out when she transferred over to the Prosecutor's Office. There's a small picture frame on the left shelf.
Ema:
Hey! This is when Lana and I went to that theme park... ...
Picture
Ema:
This was taken on that day two years ago.
Phoenix:
(The day Joe Darke ran out of the questioning room and tried to kill Ema...)
Gumshoe:
After receiving his award trophy, Mr. Marshall took a picture here, then went along with Chief Gant to question Darke. I bet he never knew he'd be dead just a few hours later...
Phoenix:
(Gee, you think?)
Lana's desk
Phoenix:
This was Lana's desk. It sure is tidy.
Ema:
Lana's always been a meticulous cleaner.
Phoenix:
There's not even any dust on it! Looks like someone's still keeping it clean. Does Lana ever come back here?
Gumshoe:
No. Chief Gant must still keep it clean in memory of their partnership. They were the stuff legends are made of!
Phoenix:
(Does he keep it in memory of her, or in memory of the crime...?)
Organ
Gumshoe:
The Chief's organ sure is a sight to behold. Occasionally we hear him playing it from the Criminal Affairs department.
Phoenix:
(That's on the 2nd floor, and this is the 15th!)
Gumshoe:
When a detective screws up, the Chief calls him to his office... and makes him listen to the organ for hours.
Ema:
What's so bad about that? Music soothes the soul!
Gumshoe:
After that, the detective can't hear anything for days except for the ringing in his ears.
Phoenix:
(So it's an instrument of punishment... literally.)
Ema:
But aren't the Chief's ears affected?
Gumshoe:
... He never listens to anyone anyway.
Phoenix:
(That's besides the point...)
Floor
Ema:
This mark looks like some kind of flower.
Gumshoe:
Word is, it's designed after the insignia on the prosecutor's badge.
Phoenix:
"Prosecutor's badge"...?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, like the one hanging from your collar.
Phoenix:
What!? They have badges too!?
Gumshoe:
The design's supposed to portray the severity of the punishment system.
Ema:
Now that you mention it, it does look all pointy and kind of painful.
Phoenix:
But Mr. Edgeworth never wears a badge.
Gumshoe:
That's because he's a sharp dresser. A badge like that wouldn't go too well with his outfit.
Ema:
So sharp dressers don't need to wear badges?
Gumshoe:
I guess everyone just kind of lets it slide.
Phoenix:
(I don't see how that's supposed to signify severe punishment...)
Examine (right side)
Safe
Phoenix:
This is a safe, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
"Safe"... that word is ripe with intrigue!
Phoenix:
Uh, okay. If you say so...
Ema:
It looks like a code needs to be entered in this panel to open it.
Phoenix:
(A seven-digit number. I think I just might know what it is...)
Input number
Leads to:
"Do you know what it is?"
Don't touch it
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure what will happen if we enter the wrong code. I'd better wait until I find something more definite.)
Ema:
A seven-digit number... Didn't we see one of those somewhere?
Gumshoe:
How about we try entering my birth date?
Gumshoe:
Do you know what it is?
Phoenix:
I have a hunch...
Gumshoe:
Oh, I know! You want to try my birth date? It's...
Phoenix:
(I have a better idea. Here goes nothing.)
Input code.
Input 7777777
Leads to:
"Code confirmed. Access granted."
Input any number else
Code input error.
Ema:
I guess that wasn't it.
Phoenix:
I was so sure that was the number!
Ema:
Maybe we should check the Court Record again!
Phoenix:
(A seven-digit number...)
Leads back into code input
Code confirmed. Access granted.
Phoenix:
Bingo.
Ema:
What number did you enter!?
Gumshoe:
Whose birthday was that, pal?
Phoenix:
"7777777." The final ID card number on that record.
Ema:
What?
Phoenix:
The number of the mysterious "executive officer" who entered the room that day.
Gumshoe:
You mean, "Sevensevensevensevensevenseven"? That ID number!?
Phoenix:
I think you're one "seven" shy this time. This can only mean one thing: That's Chief Gant's ID number!
Ema:
Say... Anyone care to look inside?
Safe (after unlocking it)
Gumshoe:
Is there any money in there? How much does he have stashed away!?
Ema:
Look! It's a... a...
Gumshoe:
a shard from a broken cup.
Phoenix:
(This somehow looks familiar. Where have I seen this before...?)
Ema:
There's something else in here too.
Phoenix:
What's this? It looks like a piece of leather cloth...
Ema:
This is a handprint, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
Hey! I saw someone wearing a shirt like that once! You think the Chief made up the design?
Ema:
Uh... I don't think so.
Gumshoe:
Oh. Well, it was just a thought.
Ema:
Is that it? This is all that was in the safe?
Phoenix:
Apparently so. It's empty now.
Gumshoe:
A piece of cloth with a handprint on it, and a broken shard from a cup.
Phoenix:
They look like pieces of evidence,
Gumshoe:
but unless you can prove they have something to do with this case, I'm afraid I can't just let you take them. After all, it's my neck on the line here!
Phoenix:
(Great. Now I have to prove their "relevancy" to get them. How are these two items related to the SL-9 Incident?)
Ema:
Come on! There's got to be something we can show the detective!
Safe (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
This is a safe, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
"Safe"... that word is ripe with intrigue!
Phoenix:
Uh, okay. If you say so...
Gant's desk
Ema:
Wow! Look at the size of Chief Gant's desk!
Phoenix:
(Speaking of that, when we were here earlier...)
Gant:
Oh, it's you two.
Phoenix:
Chief Gant! (He put that paper he was reading in his desk.)
Phoenix:
I wonder what he was reading?
Gumshoe:
This looks like a list of evidence... used in a case.
Phoenix:
A list of evidence?
Gumshoe:
In most cases the list runs twice as long as this.
Ema:
Hey, look at the case name!
Gumshoe:
Huh? "SL-9 Incident"! I wonder what this is doing here...
Phoenix:
Hold on, Detective! What did you just say?
Gumshoe:
I said, "I wonder what..."
Phoenix:
No, about evidence lists. Normally they're twice as long?
Gumshoe:
That's right. I guess there wasn't a lot of evidence.
Phoenix:
(A half-sized list of evidence...)
Edgeworth:
That list of evidence. It seems too short. Most lists... run twice as long.
Phoenix:
(What would the other half of the list be doing here?)
Ema:
I knew it! The Chief must be hiding something about that case!
Phoenix:
It would appear so.
Evidence List added to the Court Record.
Gant's desk (subsequent times)
Ema:
Wow! Look at the size of Chief Gant's desk!
Phoenix:
We found this inside the drawer. A list of evidence from the SL-9 Incident.
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth had the other half of that list!
Phoenix:
(What would this list be doing here...? We'd better look a little more into this list.)
Suit of armor
Phoenix:
This is the real deal, isn't it? This armor and these weapons?
Gumshoe:
Sure is, pal. The Chief doesn't care for imitations.
Phoenix:
First the pipe organ, now this armor... Do you know how many taxpayer dollars must have gone into this room?
Ema:
What? You mean we're paying for this!? That's it. I'm not paying one cent of my taxes!
Phoenix:
(You don't have any taxes to pay.)
Gumshoe:
Ssh! Be careful of what you say! Who knows? The Chief may be hiding in this armor as we speak!
Phoenix:
I don't think he'd fit in there.
Ema:
Even if he did, he'd never be able to get back out.
Gumshoe:
Cut it out! You guys don't know how scary that guy can be!
Right window
Ema:
You can see pretty far from 15 stories up. If you were to drop that suit of armor from here...
Gumshoe:
At first the Chief wanted to use stained glass for this window.
Ema:
Really? Why didn't he?
Gumshoe:
They say he changed his mind because he wouldn't be able to see the view.
Ema:
Oh.
Phoenix:
(Stained glass or not, it's a huge window...)
Talk
The Chief's office
Phoenix:
That desk on the other side of the room... Was that your sister's?
Ema:
Yes. That's where I was waiting for Lana... on that day two years ago.
Phoenix:
Is anyone using it now?
Gumshoe:
No sir. This is entirely Chief Gant's office now.
Gumshoe:
He practices a strict policy of "preserving the crime scene."
Phoenix:
(That's a strange reason to leave it there...)
Gumshoe:
He leaves it as a warning to everyone else. He wants us to always be alert. He told us so himself at our New Year's party. Of course, he was pretty intoxicated at the time.
Phoenix:
I see.
Ema:
So ever since Lana left, no one ever touches that desk?
Gumshoe:
No one except Chief Gant... and the cleaning lady who's in here each morning.
Phoenix:
(Still, two years have passed since that incident. There can't possibly be any clues remaining.)
Chief Gant
Gumshoe:
Can I ask you something?
Phoenix:
Sure.
Gumshoe:
You only came here to look around, right? Because it's one of the SL-9 crime scenes. I mean, that's your only reason for coming here, isn't it?
Phoenix:
... Why do you ask?
Gumshoe:
You don't think... Nah! You wouldn't be... No. ... No, there's no way. Never mind. Don't worry about it.
Phoenix:
Okay. Now then, let's look around a bit more.
Gumshoe:
Hey, hold on! Not so fast, buddy!
Phoenix:
Huh? What is it?
Gumshoe:
When someone tells you "don't worry about it," it's supposed to start bothering you, pal! You don't just let it go at that!
Phoenix:
S-sorry. (This guy's starting to get on my nerves.) Okay, so what's bothering you?
Gumshoe:
You two don't think... Chief Gant... might be a suspect, do you?
Ema:
What!? Yeah, Mr. Wright! What do we think of him?
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant... So it's finally come to this. What do I think of him? Perhaps it's best I don't divulge my feelings... yet.)
Gumshoe:
There he goes, ignoring me again.
Present
Switchblade Knife
Phoenix:
This knife belonged to the murdered, Joe Darke, right?
Gumshoe:
You bet. If it wasn't for that piece of evidence, he wouldn't have been found guilty! The broken tip of the knife was found inside the victim's body.
Phoenix:
(Ever since that case was solved, this knife's been in Detective Goodman's locker. How could it have possibly gotten to Mr. Edgeworth's car?)
Ema:
Not only that, but it was wrapped in Lana's scarf.
Gumshoe:
What's even more mysterious, is whether that's called a "scarf," or a "muffler." Answer me that, pal!
Fingerprinting Set (after examining unlocked safe, before matching fingerprints)
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe. I'd like you to have a look at this.
Gumshoe:
Hey, I know what that is! So, you want to take some fingerprints?
Ema:
That's a great idea, Detective!
Gumshoe:
All right, go to town. Sheesh! ...
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
What are you doing? Why are you sticking out your hand like that?
Gumshoe:
Go ahead. Take my fingerprints.
Ema:
... Um, it's not your fingerprints we want to take.
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Phoenix:
Come on, this isn't the time for jokes. We're talking about that cloth we found in the safe!
Gumshoe:
Oh! Heh heh! I knew that. The one with the hand print on it, right? Sheesh, where's your sense of humor?
Ema:
Okay, Mr. Wright. Let's check for prints! Sprinkle the powder on the cloth, then, once they've been absorbed into the prints, blow the rest away!
Phoenix:
(What are you, my mom? I don't have to be told a million times.) All right, let's get this over with!
Thumb, pointer, ring, or pinky finger
Obtain incomplete print
Phoenix:
Hmm... I gave it my best shot.
Ema:
That kind of result won't be any good for matching prints, will it?
Phoenix:
But it doesn't look like we'll get a clearer result from this print.
Ema:
Ok, let's try a different finger, then!
Leads back to finger selection
Middle finger

Comparing...Comparison complete.

Ema:
No, that doesn't match.
Phoenix:
It looks like we're out of clues this time.
Ema:
Yeah... But it was inside the Chief's safe.
Phoenix:
Right, along with that shard.
Ema:
So that means it's got to have something to do with that incident!
Phoenix:
(The one that happened right here in this room... She's right! We should check the fingerprints of everyone who was in here that day!)
Gumshoe:
The way I see it, there's a higher power at work here. You just gotta have faith.
Leads back to profile selection
Phoenix:
(No... How can this be!? What are Ema's fingerprints doing here!?)
Ema:
Hey, you found a match? Whose fingerprints were they!?
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, uh... it seems the prints are too old. They aren't clear enough to get a match.
Ema:
Oh... That's too bad. I thought they'd be Darke's prints.
Gumshoe:
Psst! Hey you. Over here. What's going on here? What are that kid's prints doing inside the Chief's safe?
Phoenix:
Don't ask me! Let's just keep this information from Ema for now.
Gumshoe:
... Here. Maybe you should hold onto this.
Strip of Cloth folded and added to the Court Record.
Unstable Jar (before examining unlocked safe)
Gumshoe:
Now I know where I saw that before... It was right here!
Phoenix:
"Here"? You mean, in the Chief's office? 
Gumshoe:
If I recall, it used to sit right on top of that shelf... two years ago. I used to stare at it while being forced to listen to that organ.
Ema:
You would stare at it?
Gumshoe:
I'd try to use my telepathy to knock it over. 
Phoenix:
Your telepathy... 
Ema:
Hey, there it is! Right there in that picture, see?
Phoenix:
Oh yeah.
Unstable Jar (after examining unlocked safe)
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe. Could you have another look at this jar?
Gumshoe:
All of us put that back together. Oh, those were the days...
Phoenix:
(It's kind of early to be nostalgic.)
Ema:
Wasn't this jar a piece of evidence from that case?
Gumshoe:
That's right. One of the shards had an "SL-9 Incident" sticker on it.
Phoenix:
Doesn't this ring any bells? You know, that fragment we just found?
Gumshoe:
You mean this one, that was in the safe?
Ema:
Yes, that one... that was in the safe.
Gumshoe:
...&#160;! Now that you mention it, it's ringing a lot of bells! Let's see if it fits!
Assemble fragments
Leads to:
"Here, let me see that shard. I'll take a crack at this."
Leave it be for now
Phoenix:
Maybe we shouldn't do this right now.
Gumshoe:
What!? Look, bud. You don't get someone all worked up, then just leave them hanging! You're as bad as that girl I met back when I was 16...
Ema:
Sixteen... That's the same age I am. I wonder what happened?
Phoenix:
(It's hard to imagine Detective Gumshoe had a childhood.)
Ema:
Well, if we don't do it now, then let's at least do it later!
Phoenix:
Here, let me see that shard. I'll take a crack at this.
Gumshoe:
Go ahead, pal. Show us what a rookie can do!
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Here's some glue!
Phoenix:
(If I can piece this together again... it'll prove Chief Gant was knowingly hiding evidence! Here goes...)
Combine available pieces
Leads to:
"There! It fits like a charm. That of course means..."
Back
Phoenix:
I don't get it! This piece doesn't fit anywhere in this jar!
Ema:
What? But it has to!
Phoenix:
Well, I need a breather. I'll try it again later.
Ema:
If you don't, I'll switch your eyedrops with my special solution!
Phoenix:
There! It fits like a charm. That of course means... Chief Gant willingly and knowingly hid a piece of this jar in his safe.
Ema:!
Phoenix:
In other words, he concealed a piece of evidence from the SL-9 Incident.
Ema:
But...
Gumshoe:
Hey guys! Get a load of this!
Phoenix:
What is it?
Gumshoe:
This piece you just attached... it's different from the others!
Ema:
There's a reddish line on it!
Phoenix:
(A reddish line... That's blood!)
Gumshoe:
I don't get it! Why would Chief Gant hide this in his safe?
The Unstable Jar data has been updated.
Unstable Jar (after completion)
Gumshoe:
I feel a lot better now that this jar's complete.
Ema:
But it only raises another question: What was a piece of it doing in the Chief's safe?
Gumshoe:
More importantly, why wasn't there any money in there? Isn't that what safes are for anyway!?
Phoenix:
(I have a feeling the outcome of tomorrow's trial just might hinge on this...)
Evidence List
Ema:
That's what the Chief was reading before, isn't it? You know, when we first came in here?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It looks like the right side of the form's been torn off.
Ema:
So Mr. Edgeworth's list really was only half of the whole thing!
Gumshoe:
Something else is buggin' me more than that. Take a look at the back of that form, pal.
Phoenix:
(The back...?)
Strip of Cloth
Phoenix:
What is this strip of cloth, anyway?
Gumshoe:
It's smooth, and sort of feels like vinyl. I think I've felt something like this before... ... Nah, I can't remember.
Phoenix:
It seems this is becoming a habit with you.
Gumshoe:
I can't keep anything in my head lately!
Ema:
Note to Self: Detective Gumshoe is going senile.
Phoenix:
(Ema's fingerprints were found on this cloth. I have a bad feeling about this...)
Anything else
Gumshoe:
If I'm fired, I won't be able to give you any information! So that's why I have to get it all out of my system now! You understand, don't you?
Ema:
Don't be so negative, Detective! We do want you to share your information, though.
Gumshoe:
Oh, who am I fooling? I've never had anything useful to share to begin with.
Ema:
Argh! Got... to stay... positive!
Spray luminol
Floor behind Lana's desk
Ema:
Whoa! This area must have been covered in blood!
Phoenix:
Is this from that incident?
Ema:
It must be. When Prosecutor Neil Marshall was murdered. Two years have passed, so the reaction's kind of dull.
Phoenix:
(So a murder really did take place here.)
Examine evidence
Bloodstain on Unstable Jar (after completion)
Ema:
Hey, look here! It's hard to make out, but there's a dark red stain here.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Looks like blood.
Ema:
This piece the Chief has is different, though. The blood stains on the other pieces are just spots, but this one's a line!
Phoenix:
(That is odd...)
Back of Evidence List
Phoenix:
I wonder what this is? (It looks like someone drew some kind of sketch here!)
Ema:
What is it? Did you find something?
Phoenix:
(I can't make it out. I'd better keep quiet about it for now.) Huh? Oh. No, it's nothing.
Ema:
Why are your eyes moving about like that, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(I'd better not forget about this picture!)
Handprint on Strip of Cloth
Ema:
This is a handprint, right?
Phoenix:
Yeah. Someone left behind an oil stain on the fabric. Whoever it was, they must have had a really oily hand.
Ema:
Mr. Wright, think about it scientifically!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
A more likely explanation is... the person slipped and fell on a freshly waxed floor, getting wax all over their hand.
Phoenix:
Well, that would account for this amount of oil I guess. (I don't see what's so "scientific" about it though.)
Ema:
It happens, you know. I always slip on the floors at school after they're waxed.
(Examining Gant's desk, clearing all "Talk" options, fingerprinting Strip of Cloth, and completing Unstable Jar leads to:)
Gumshoe:
Well? Was I any help?
Phoenix:
Of course! Thanks to your ID card, we were able to get some hard evidence.
???:
Now that's not very kind, is it? In other words, if it wasn't for his ID card, he would have been useless...
Gant:
Isn't that right, you in the coat?
Ema:
EEEEEEEK!
Gumshoe:
C-Chief Gant!
Phoenix:
We didn't think you'd be back so soon.
Gant:
Fortunately I'm a man who believes in signs. As I was walking to my meeting, I happened to look out a window and saw a stray dog run right into a pole. Just then I thought of a certain detective.
Gumshoe:
Do you mean... m-me, sir?
Gant:
Now then, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you all to leave.
Ema:
Y-yes sir! Sorry...
Gant:
Oh, you in the coat.
Gumshoe:
Me, sir!?
Gant:
Drop off your ID on the way out. You won't be needing it anymore.
Gumshoe:
But sir...
Gant:
Now get out!
Gumshoe:
Y-y-yes sir!
Phoenix:
We'll be on our way too, then.
Gant:
Wait. You, the one without the spiky hair. Don't go yet.
Ema:
M-me, sir!?
Gant:
I'd like a word with you.
Ema:
But sir! I'm not a licensed scientific investigator yet!
Gant:
You with the spiky hair. You're free to go.
Ema:
M-Mr. Wright!!!
Police Dept. Entrance
Gumshoe:
Look, pal! If I've told you once I've told you a thousand times...
Examine evidence
Bloodstain on Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
The dark red stains must be blood traces from the incident two years ago. Only the fragment found in Chief Gant's office still has lines remaining on it.
Back of Evidence List
Phoenix:
A picture is drawn on the back of the evidence list in magic marker. I've got a very bad feeling about this...
Handprint on Strip of Cloth
Phoenix:
A clear handprint can be seen on the leather cloth. The print belongs to Ema... I think I'll keep this information to myself.
Gumshoe:
The Chief's office is off limits! But no, you just had to go sneaking in there like that, didn't you!?
Phoenix:
I thought you said you didn't care anymore if you were fired.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but if I knew it'd be like this, I never would've said it!
Phoenix:
(Now that I've seen the evidence Chief Gant was hiding in his office... I think I'm finally starting to get the picture... It's hard to believe anyone could keep quiet about it all this time...)
Gumshoe:
Anyway, you listenin' to me!? I'm gonna try to smooth things over with the Chief again! Later, pal!
Phoenix:
After that, I heard from Ema. She said the police want to ask her some questions, so she'll be busy for the rest of the day...
February 24Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Lana:
I see. So the Chief asked Ema to come in for questioning...
Phoenix:
It's no use thinking about it. Tomorrow's the final day in court. I'm committed to doing everything I can to defend you, which is why I'm here.
Lana:
But I've already told you all I can...
Phoenix:
What you've told me over these past couple of days... is absolutely nothing. Not a single, useful thing.
Lana:
Really? I believe I did mention something quite important. Something I told you right at the beginning. I said that I was the one who stabbed Detective Goodman.
Phoenix:
You know, I think I've finally figured it out... Who it is you're hiding behind those words.
Lana:
... Mia did a good job mentoring you. I'm rather jealous...
Phoenix:!
Lana:
It seems Edgeworth was right.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth...?
Lana:
Once you're convinced you know something, no one can persuade you otherwise. "Thick headed" is the term he used, I believe.
Phoenix:
(Now's my chance to get her to tell me the rest of the story!)
Talk
Keeping quiet
Phoenix:
I have to admit I was more than a little perplexed at first. You insisted you "did it," yet there was no incriminating evidence. That's when it hit me. It's not that you're unwilling to tell the truth, it's that you're incapable of doing so, because of a certain individual.
Lana:
What an intriguing notion. A certain, "individual," you say? So you think I'm... protecting this person?
Phoenix:
Protecting? No. I think "afraid of" is more like it.
Lana:!
Phoenix:
If I'm not mistaken, the person in question may have persuaded you to silence.
Lana:
... For argument's sake, Mr. Wright, whom may I ask is this person you're speaking of? The one I am supposedly so "frightened" of? What is this person's name?
Present Damon Gant profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Well, Ms. Skye?"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The person whom you fear... is this!
Lana:
To be honest, there's someone a bit scarier.
Phoenix:
W-who would that be?
Lana:
Why you, of course.
Phoenix:
Me?
Lana:
Yes. You seriously believe what you're saying, don't you? Now that's scary.
Phoenix:
I, uh...
Lana:
You seem to have the makings of a criminal in you, what with all your fallacious accusations. Care to spend tonight in the next cell?
Phoenix:
(If you ask me, you're the scary one...)
Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Skye?
Lana:
... Mr. Wright. You are addressing the Chief Prosecutor. Do not forget your place.
Phoenix:
(I take it she's still not ready to spill the beans.)
Lana:
My apologies. Could you please tell me a bit more about the circumstances?
Damon Gant (appears after Keeping quiet)
Lana:
We were partners until two years ago. I respected him as a detective.
Phoenix:
Assuming he is respectable, then tell me something... Why would he try to hide his crimes?
Lana:
His "crimes"...?
Phoenix:
Both you and Edgeworth will be brought before a board of inquiry for what you did. Specifically, hiding and forging evidence.
Lana:
Of course, these are serious offenses...
Phoenix:
Why is it, though, that Chief Gant's name was never mentioned?
Lana:
Chief Gant...?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth didn't know the truth behind the forgery. The only party who could have possible ([sic]) investigated that evidence was...
Lana:
Me. I had access because I was second in command of that investigation.
Phoenix:
Yes you, but also one other: Damon Gant.
Lana:
... If you intend to accuse Chief Gant, you'll need more than just words. Show me proof that Chief Gant falsified evidence in that case!
Present Unstable Jar or Evidence List
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I just found this in a safe in the Chief's office."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
You want proof of the Chief's wrongdoings? Here it is!
Lana:
That "evidence" proves someone is doing something wrong all right, but it's not the Chief.
Phoenix:
W-who would that be?
Lana:
Why you, of course.
Phoenix:
Me?
Lana:
Yes. You seriously believe what you're saying, don't you? Now that's scary.
Phoenix:
I, uh...
Lana:
You seem to have the makings of a criminal in you, what with all your fallacious accusations. Care to spend tonight in the next cell?
Phoenix:
(If you ask me, you're the scary one...)
Phoenix:
I just found this in a safe in the Chief's office. This jar piece, and this strip of cloth. Do you know what these are? They're pieces of evidence from the SL-9 Incident!
Lana:
I...
Phoenix:
The person concealing evidence was none other than Chief Gant himself. Now tell me! Why are you taking all the blame for him!?
Lana:
... Touché, Mr. Wright. It's as you surmised. I cannot disobey the Chief's orders... even if it means being found guilty for murder.
Phoenix:
Why not?
Lana:
Come now, Mr. Wright. You can't possibly expect me to be able to tell you that. Three days ago... I had no choice but to cooperate.
Phoenix:
(In the murder of Detective Goodman!)
Lana:
Or perhaps I should say, "follow orders." Yes, that's more accurate than "cooperate."
"Orders" (appears after Damon Gant)
Lana:
Although I can't tell you the details, I can say that I was given an order that day.
"I need you to dispose of Bruce Goodman's body. You'll find it inside the trunk of Miles Edgeworth's car."
Phoenix:
Just as I suspected. Despite what everyone believes... you were not the one who murdered Detective Goodman!
Lana:
Correct. I was trying to take the body out of Edgeworth's car. The trunk was broken. I discovered that murder weapon while inspecting the body.
Phoenix:
The murder weapon... You mean, Edgeworth's knife?
Lana:
No. When I found the body, this was the knife stuck in it.
Phoenix:
(The knife from the SL-9 Incident... serial killer Joe Darke's knife!)
Lana:
I couldn't just leave that knife in him, so I took it out and stabbed him with another knife.
Phoenix:
That would be Edgeworth's knife?
Lana:
That's right. Even though he was already dead, my hands were shaking at the thought of stabbing him. That's why I ended up cutting my hand.
Phoenix:
And that is the reason for the bandage on your right hand?
Lana:
Yes. It seems that I got blood on the victim's shoes as well. And then... she saw me just as I plunged the knife in.
Phoenix:
(Ms. Starr...) Why did you need to hide Darke's knife so badly?
Darke's Knife (appears after "Orders")
Leads to:
"It took a lot of work to finally close the Darke case two years ago."
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
(Showing evidence isn't going to do me any good now. I've got to get Lana to tell me everything she's hiding!)
Lana:
Mr. Wright. You're evolving by leaps and bounds. I'm starting to see the hunger in your eyes.
Move
Phoenix:
I need to hear what Lana has to say. Then I can finish up the investigation.
Lana:
It took a lot of work to finally close the Darke case two years ago. It was over with. I didn't ever want it to be opened again. My intent was to prevent that by whatever means possible.
Phoenix:
So... you hid Darke's knife?
Lana:
The weapon used to stab the detective was evidence in the Joe Darke case... If word got out, which it would, the reporters would have a field day with that.
Phoenix:
So you wrapped the knife in your scarf, and hid it. In Edgeworth's exhaust pipe...
Lana:
Right. Then I called my sister, to tell her what happened, and to ask her to hide the knife that was inside my muffler.
Phoenix:
You asked Ema?
Lana:
I didn't want anyone on the force to know about this.
Phoenix:
(That would explain why Ema is so confident... about Lana's innocence!)
Lana:
Speaking of phone calls, I had a bad feeling about one of them that day.
Phoenix:
A bad feeling?
Lana:
The truth is, after I received those orders from Chief Gant. The first thing I did was make a phone call. A phone call to Patrolman Jake Marshall.
Phoenix:
To Marshall? Why on earth would you call him?
Lana:
The lead investigator for the SL-9 Incident had been murdered. I wanted that fact to be kept hidden, and I needed help. He was the only other person I could trust. Or at least, I thought I could trust him at the time. However, it seems that after I spoke to him he went off on an escapade of his own...
Phoenix:
Oh! You mean...
Lana:
Not wanting the case to die, he decided to take things into his own hands.
Phoenix:
(He disguised himself as Officer Goodman and tried to steal the evidence!)
Lana:
He had already stolen the ID card... but it seems he still hadn't made up his mind to break into the evidence room. After my phone call, any remaining doubts he had must have disappeared.
Phoenix:
So your phone call caused the incident in the evidence room!?
Lana:
I'm afraid that's all I can tell you.
Phoenix:
But Lana...
Lana:
You've earned my respect, Mr. Wright. Both as a defense attorney and an investigator. Now please... Don't pursue this any further in court tomorrow!
Phoenix:
(Tomorrow's trial... There's only one way to drive off Lana's demons...)
Phoenix:
(I've got to get to the bottom of everything! Detective Goodman's real murderer... and what went down in the Chief's office two years ago...)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
Exit fingerprint checking session
Phoenix:
(I think I'd like to try one of the other fingerprints.)
Ema:
Okay, let's move on to a different finger!
