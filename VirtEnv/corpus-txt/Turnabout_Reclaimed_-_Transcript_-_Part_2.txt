District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 
Athena:
Good morning, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Good morning. Chipper as ever this morning, I see.
Athena:
I'm just thankful we actually get to have a trial for Orla. As a matter of fact, I just ran a few laps around the courthouse to get extra pumped!
Phoenix:
(And I just splashed my face with some water to get the sleep out of my eyes...)
Athena:
Oh, I also cued the Swashbuckler video so we can watch it any time.
Swashbuckler Video added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Thanks. It just might help our case. By the way, you have some serious dark circles. Did you stay up late watching this?
Athena:
What?! M-Me? No, I, uh, just woke up early, that's all. ...Guess I need to cover them up. I get ragged on enough as it is by Prosecutor Blackquill.
Phoenix:
Speaking of being pumped, I'm pretty fired up for this trial, too. It's been a while.
Athena:
Hee hee. That explains why your hair is spikier than usual. I mean, look at it! It's all super pokey and prickly and stuff. It's amazing!
Phoenix:
(...That was a compliment... right?)
Pearl:
Good luck, Mr. Nick! I'll be cheering you on from the gallery.
Phoenix:
Thanks, Pearls. It's been so long, I'm actually a little nervous.
Rimes:
Good morning, Mr. Lawyer!
Athena:
Oh, Mr. Rimes! You came to watch the trial?
Rimes:
Yeah. Sasha is back at the aquarium with the orca... ...so I thought I'd better come here to watch for her.
Athena:
Well, don't you worry! We're going to win for Orla! Isn't that right, Boss?!
Phoenix:
(Right. One unprecedented trial, coming right up!)
July 21, 9:30 AM
District Court - Courtroom No. 4
Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Orla Shipley.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Blackquill:
Hmph............ Must we waste words on this?
Phoenix:
(Prosecutor Simon Blackquill... Known as the "Twisted Samurai," he's a prosecutor who's also a convicted felon. They say he never conducts a trial without his loyal hawk Taka by his side.)
Judge:
...Mr. Wright, it's been quite a while since I've seen you like that. The lawyer image suits you. You look younger somehow. 
Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. And you look as young as ever yourself. 
Judge:
Ha ha ha. Well, I have to keep up with you folks, after all. By the way, has the defendant arrived in court yet?
Blackquill:
...Surely you jest, Your Baldness. Did you not receive the memo? The defendant, Ora Shipley, is an orca at Shipshape Aquarium. 
Judge:
A-An orcaaaaaaaaaaaaa?! Arrangements for this trial were made only yesterday, so I didn't have time to review. But an orca as a defendant? It's patently absurd!
Blackquill:
Hmph......... Direct your comments to the defense. He's the absurd fellow who insisted on defending the orca in court in the first place.
Phoenix:
Absurd or not, I will carry out my duty to defend my client. 
Judge:
Your duty to defend your "crying ant"? Don't you mean your "crying orca," Mr. Wright?
Blackquill:
If we are to proceed, we must treat the orca as we would any other defendant. Every soul -- be it of man or beast -- is of equal value. The question is whether that soul is painted in black or white. Take Taka for example. He is as human in spirit as you or I. 
Taka:
*Screech!*
Phoenix:
(The real question is, am I in for more pain... as always?)
Judge:
Hmm... Orca or not, I suppose the defendant is still a defendant. And I vow to render my verdict fairly and impartially! *ahem* Now then, Prosecutor Blackquill, your opening statement, if you would.
Blackquill:
I suppose I can hardly leave it to someone who knew nothing of the defendant... Very well. Listen carefully. The orca murdered the owner of Shipshape Aquarium in the aquarium's orca pool. The orca apparently toyed with the victim mercilessly as he died.
Judge:
A sadistic orca... What a chilling thought. And where exactly is this defendant now?
Blackquill:
Inside this.
Judge:
A-A cell phone, Prosecutor Blackquill?
Blackquill:
Hmph... Time marches on, Your Baldness -- with or without us. I borrowed this TV phone from the aquarium, which will allow us to interact with the orca.
Judge:
A "TV phone"? Very well. The court accepts it into evidence.
TV Phone added to the Court Record.
Blackquill:
We will be able to view the defendant in question on this large monitor. Fool Bright, prepare for transmission.
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! You've got it, Prosecutor Blackquill!
Blackquill:
We will proceed with the defendant on telecast.
Judge:
Hmm... So that is the orca that stands accused, is it?
Orla:
Fwee, fweet!
Phoenix:
(Aw. She's waving her flipper at us. Maybe she's cheering us on?)
Buckler:
Orla, wish Phoenix and Athena luck!
Orla:
Fweeeet!
Judge:
Oh, it's quite cute, isn't it? And this adorable creature is suspected of killing a man...?
Athena:
Orla's really pouring on the charm, huh!
Blackquill:
She is far from "cute." She is a violent, reckless animal. 
Fulbright:
That's right! The name's Bobby Fulbright, and I'll take over the explaining from here. Now, if I could direct your attention to this diagram of the crime scene. Following the report of an orca attack, we the police raced on over to Shipshape Aquarium. There, we found a guest who says she saw the orca and the victim from the visitor's corridor. As the witness was watching, the orca suddenly went crazy and attacked the victim. The orca was the only one there; therefore, no one else could have committed the crime. It's not quite finished, but I have a portion of the autopsy report here.
Shipley's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Judge:
I can't imagine the terror of being attacked underwater by such a large creature...
Blackquill:
But attack it did. Prepare yourself for the grisly details, Your Baldness. The prosecution moves to introduce our witness. ...Fool Bright.
Fulbright:
You got it, Prosecutor Blackquill! In justice we trust! One brave lady whose fine sense of justice compelled her to speak, coming right up!
DePlume:
How dare you make me wait? Don't you know I'm a busy woman?! I could have written an entire book for all the time I spent in that lobby!
Judge:
Um... Prosecutor Blackquill?
Blackquill:
............Well?
DePlume:
I am Norma DePlume, and I'm a nonfiction writer.
Phoenix:
(Am I the only one who isn't telepathic here?)
Athena:
Looks like she can read into people's words just as well as I can read into people's hearts.
Phoenix:
Not everything needs to be a competition, Athena...
Judge:
What?! Norma DePlume?! The great nonfiction writer, Ms. Norma DePlume herself?! I've read all of your works and enjoyed them immensely. Your million seller, "The Great Grief of the Great Thief," is one of my favorites.
DePlume:
Oh, are you a fan, Your Honor? I could give you my autograph, if you'd like.
Judge:
Wait a second... I could swear you looked much different in the photos in your book......
DePlume:
Well, I use ones from ten years ago in my books so that paparazzi won't harass me.
Judge:
...! 
Athena:
The judge seems to be shocked.
Phoenix:
The visual disconnect must really be doing a number on His Honor's head...
DePlume:
Could we get started, please? If I find you to be lacking as a judge... ...you will see your debut in my books!
Judge:
Such harsh comments...! You really MUST be the real Norma DePlume.
Phoenix:
(Who knew Ms. DePlume was so famous?)
Blackquill:
Enough jabbering. Tell the court what you saw, and keep it brief.
DePlume:
I would thank you to not order me around. I am perfectly willing to tell everyone what I witnessed. It was the moment of the murder!
Judge:
...Very well, then. Please proceed with your testimony. 
Witness Testimony
-- The Moment of the Murder -- 
DePlume:
I went to Shipshape Aquarium to see the killer whale.
As I was watching the killer whale from the visitor's corridor, it suddenly went crazy!
I saw the killer whale bite the victim to death with its huge mouth and deadly teeth!
Attempting to remain calm, I reported the incident to the police immediately. 
Judge:
The adorable defendant really did all that?! Hmm... It must be much more vicious than it looks...
Blackquill:
Now, deliver your judgment so I may carry out the sentence. 
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Umm... the defense would like to do some defending first, if that's all right...
Blackquill:
Hmph... Must you drag this out with your tomfoolery?
Athena:
Athena:
The defense always has the right to cross-examine the witness, you know!
Blackquill:
A fellow inmate told me just this morning... "If you want something signed, all you need is the document and a witness."
Phoenix:
...Let me guess. They were convicted for contract fraud, right?
Blackquill:
............ All we need in this case is the evidence and a witness to convict. It's as simple as that.
Phoenix:
(Looks like I guessed right.) Sorry, but as Ms. Cykes said... ...the defense has every right to cross-examine. Isn't that correct, Your Honor?
Judge:
Yes, of course. You may proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
Blackquill:
.........I shall relish the sight of you thrashing around in vain.
Cross Examination
-- The Moment of the Murder --
DePlume:
I went to Shipshape Aquarium to see the killer whale.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Why did you want to see the orca?
DePlume:
Well, it IS the featured attraction of the aquarium, after all. 
Blackquill:
Hmph. Why waste energy on such tripe? There is but one attraction in Shipshape Aquarium that is worth anyone's time... ...and that is the penguins. Isn't that right, Taka, my friend?
Phoenix:
(All righty then. I guess Prosecutor Blackquill is for the birds.) 
Athena:
Guess I should jot that down. Note to self: Prosecutor Blackquill is on Team Rifle.
Judge:
And so you went to see the orca in its tank?
DePlume:
Yes, that's right.
DePlume:
As I was watching the killer whale from the visitor's corridor, it suddenly went crazy!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The orca suddenly went crazy, did she?
DePlume:
Yes. It took a look at me, and then, all at once, it started going berserk!
Phoenix:
Did you do anything to make her angry?
DePlume:
I did nothing more than simply glare at it from the visitor's corridor!
Phoenix:
(She glared at Orla?) And that's what caused her to go berserk?
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
The reason the defendant went mad is not the issue here. Only what she did once she entered that state.
DePlume:
In any case, the killer whale began behaving wildly in front of my very eyes. And then...
DePlume:
I saw the killer whale bite the victim to death with its huge mouth and deadly teeth!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So you're saying you saw the very moment of the victim's death?
DePlume:
That is exactly what I'm saying! Oh, it was simply dreadful! It was as frightening as losing one's manuscript just before a deadline!
Phoenix:
(I suppose for a writer, that would be pretty terrifying...) 
DePlume:
I witnessed the killer whale's horrific act, and I knew I had to do something, so...
Present Shipley's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"It would seem that you are mistaken, Ms. DePlume."
DePlume:
Attempting to remain calm, I reported the incident to the police immediately.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Why were the police the first ones you contacted?
DePlume:
I was afraid if I told aquarium staff, they might try to cover it up. Of course, I immediately told aquarium security after my call to the police. I believe I deserve praise for my swift decision-making skills under pressure!
Phoenix:
...Ms. DePlume is the most assertive witness I've ever seen.
Athena:
We'd better do our best to look like big-shot lawyers if we want to match her intensity!
Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume, I praise your swift decision-making skills under pressure!
Athena:
That was more "kiss up" than "big shot"...
Judge:
I suppose it was unrealistic to expect "big shot" from Mr. Wright...
Blackquill:
Hmph. How fitting for a small fry to praise a big shot.
Phoenix:
(How about cutting this small fry some slack, you big meanies?)
Phoenix:
(The important thing here is, did she really see the "moment of the murder"?)
Athena:
You're raring to go, aren't you, Mr. Wright? I see it in your eyes... and in your heart!
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. I guess I really am a lawyer at heart.
Phoenix:
It would seem that you are mistaken, Ms. DePlume.
DePlume:
I beg your pardon?!
Phoenix:
The autopsy report does indeed say, "Death thought to be result of orca attack"... ...but the actual cause of death is "contusion from head trauma," not "being bitten"!
DePlume:
What?! B-But...! But... I'm sure the victim was bitten!
Phoenix:
I don't believe that can be true. The security footage doesn't show anything of the kind.
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
Hmph............ Just as I suspected. I knew you would peek at the footage behind Fool Bright's back.
Phoenix:
(Well, what did you expect when he wouldn't play nice and share?)
Blackquill:
But, unfortunately for you... ...the footage you saw was only one small part.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Blackquill:
Yesterday, after I decided to take this case to trial, I re-reviewed all of the evidence. Taka, the evidence I gave to you for safekeeping.
Taka:
*Screech!*
Phoenix:
(Guess that hawk is higher up on the pecking order than Fulbright in Blackquill's book.)
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Let's view the footage. Wh-What's this?! The orca is biting the victim!
Phoenix:
N-No waaaaaay!
Judge:
I have to say that this appears to be very damning evidence.
Security Footage updated in the Court Record.
Athena:
No... I can't believe Orla really bit him!
Blackquill:
And there is more... Look at this. This photograph was taken while the body was being examined.
Judge:
Hmm... There seems to be a strange bruise on the victim's right wrist.
Blackquill: 
I'll have the crime lab examine the bruise and calculate its relevance to the case at hand. What's important right now is evidence that points to the orca as the killer. Look at the left side of the body. See the orca's tooth marks in the victim's clothes?
Judge:
Yes! They do appear to suggest that she did, in fact, bite the victim.
Phoenix:
...!
Photo of the Body updated in the Court Record.
DePlume:
I told you so! And then the killer whale swam up toward the surface with the victim in its mouth!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
H-However! In the autopsy report, the cause of death is "contusion from head trauma"!
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
You are much too impetuous, Wright-dono. Granted, the orca biting the victim was not the cause of death. The witness was mistaken about that.
Judge:
Then what explanation is there for what the witness saw?!
Blackquill: 
Did I not say in the beginning, "The orca toyed with the victim mercilessly"?
Judge:
M-My goodness!
Blackquill: 
After killing the victim, the defendant swam around with his dead body in her mouth. Just like any other predator toying with its prey!
Phoenix:
(Nrgh...!)
Athena:
M-Mr. Wright! The hearts of the people in the gallery are suddenly filled with fear -- fear of Orla!
Judge:
So the defendant bit the victim after she had killed him... But if that's the case, then we must still figure out how the defendant killed the victim. Prosecutor Blackquill, do you have a sound theory to give to this court?
Blackquill: 
I wouldn't be standing here if I couldn't prove whether the orca's heart was black or white.
Athena:
But Orla is black AND white! ...Her body, I mean.
Phoenix:
Athena, please try not to provoke Prosecutor Blackquill.
Blackquill:
The witness also observed the actual moment of the murder. Think back, Word Mistress. Think back to what you observed before the orca bit the victim.
DePlume:
...Ah, I see what you're driving at. So that was the true moment of the murder, was it?
Blackquill:
Now, explain it in a way that even these simpletons can understand.
DePlume:
There you go again, ordering me around! Stop that this instant! But whatever... I don't mind telling my story. I saw the killer whale before it toyed with the body as well. I saw it the moment it killed the victim by head-butting him!
Phoenix:
O-Orla killed the victim by head-butting him?!
DePlume:
That's right. It rammed the victim over and over again.
Blackquill:
Recall that the autopsy report stated that there were bruises all over his body. Recall as well, how persistent the defendant can be when she's attacking her prey.
DePlume:
And we all just saw the killer whale head-butting the victim in the footage, don't forget.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... That footage backs up Ms. DePlume's testimony... But there's also something very important it does NOT show...!)
DePlume:
Now do you see what a menace this killer whale is?
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, but I can't allow your testimony to stand unchallenged. Looking at this footage, the orca certainly seems to be head-butting something... ...but you'll note that the "something" is not the victim!
DePlume:
Oh! ...Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
Phoenix:
(I want to look away... but I can't...). Even if it was the victim, you couldn't have seen him from where you were, could you?
DePlume:
............What? O-Oh. Well... I suppose not...
Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume, did you actually witness the victim getting head-butted by the defendant?
DePlume:
Ah, let's see... Oh, I remember now! As I recall, a rock in the shape of a skull was obstructing my view.
Judge:
So are you admitting that you couldn't see the victim?
DePlume:
Yes... Yes, I suppose I am. However! Immediately after the head-butting, the victim came floating up! He came up from behind the skull-shaped rock, and his body was all limp. What else could I think except that the killer whale was head-butting the victim?!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But if you didn't actually see the moment of attack itself, then it's pure conjecture!
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
*sigh* Must I do everything around here?
DePlume:
H-How dare you speak so rudely to me?!
Blackquill:
There's no need for hysterics. Clear your mind and recall how you reached your conclusion. Though you couldn't see what the orca was attacking, you didn't need to, did you? Because you knew she was behaving exactly as she had only one year prior.
DePlume:
Oh!
Phoenix:
(One year ago...?)
DePlume:
That's right! Yes, that's it! That's how I knew the killer whale was head-butting the victim! 
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, but could someone explain exactly what happened a year ago?
Blackquill:
If you must know, a very similar incident occurred only last year, in which... ...the defendant murdered her trainer. 
Judge:
Wh-Whaaaaaaat?! The orca murdered her trainer, you say?!
Phoenix:
What?! Is this really true?! (This is not looking good for us!)
Blackquill:
It's all in this book. 
Judge:
That book... "The Killer Killer Whale"...! That's Ms. DePlume's latest work! I was just thinking of picking that up.
"The Killer Killer Whale" added to the Court Record.
Blackquill:
Last year, the defendant killed her trainer in the middle of a show. The orca head-butted and bit the victim.
Phoenix:
(The same thing she's accused of in this case!)
Woman:
That orca killed two people?!
Man:
That thing is a menace! Guilty! Guilty, I say!
Man:
I never want to go to the beach again!
Phoenix:
(We were doing so well, but now... Now everyone in the room has a bad impression of Orla. I don't want to think she did it... ...but it's hard to keep on believing in somebody who can't even tell me her side...)
Orla:
Fwee, fweet?
Buckler:
Phoenix! Athena! You gotta believe in Orla! There's no way she killed anybody! You gotta save her! Please, I'm begging you!
Phoenix:
Sasha... (What am I doing, doubting my client like this? This is the time to be strong!)
Athena:
I believe in Orla! And I'm ready to fight for our clients! I'll take everybody in this courtroom on if I have to!
Phoenix:
Don't you worry, Sasha. We won't give up on Orla. We'll defend her to the very end!
Buckler:
Thank you! Thank you, both of you!
Orla:
Fweet, fweet!
Phoenix:
(We are Orla's lawyers. Who else but us can save her?! We can't give up on her now!)
Blackquill:
Hmph... For an instant there, you were afraid of the orca, weren't you, Wright-dono. When you saw the photograph of the victim from a year ago, you turned paler than me.
Phoenix:
! (He saw right through me!)
Blackquill:
It's obvious you have neither the guts nor the determination to defend the orca.
Phoenix:
It's true that Orla can't speak, and I don't know her thoughts... ...but there's a certain someone who believes in Orla with all her heart. I respect the trust she has in Orla, so I'm willing to believe in Orla, too.
Blackquill:
Hmph. And what do you know about orcas? Nothing, that's what. So, allow me to fill you in. Do you have any idea why orcas are also called "killer whales"? Because they are cunning and merciless predators that hunt and kill even true whales.
Judges:
So "killer whales" really are "killers"! What terrifying creatures indeed...
Blackquill:
I can't bear to hear any more of such rubbish as "trusting a killer." Can you, Your Baldness?
Phoenix:
No matter what you say, I will continue to believe. I don't give up that easily, you know.
Blackquill:
............Dullard. You don't know when to give up, do you? Very well. I shall give you a chance to prove just how determined you are. Witness, spare no quarter and lay the full truth on them.
DePlume:
Oh ho ho! But of course! That is what I do, after all. 
Judge:
Prosecutor Blackquill, what will you have the witness testify about?
Blackquill:
I shall have her testify about what she saw, and what she heard.
Phoenix:
What she heard...?
Judge:
Very well. Ms. DePlume, please tell the court what you saw and what you heard. 
Witness Testimony
-- What I Saw and What I Heard --
DePlume:
The killer whale's behavior was exactly the same as a year ago. 
As I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing.
I was calm when I saw it start to head-butt.
But when the pirate hat and victim came floating up, I let out a scream! 
Judge:
Hmm... So the orca displayed the same behavior as during the incident a year ago...
DePlume:
That's right! Those weren't just simple cries. It was singing! As I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing! It kept head-butting while it sang the Swashbuckler Spectacular song! That's right. It was singing the same song it sang in the aquarium's stage show back then. It was singing while it was head-butting! Oh, it was perfectly horrible! 
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I don't see a single obvious inconsistency in this testimony. It's clear I won't be able to take her apart her statements with evidence alone.)
Athena:
Mr. Wright! Now would be a good time for me to put my skills to work! It's time to show what analytical psychology can really do!
Phoenix:
You seem pretty confident. Let me guess. You noticed a contradiction between the testimony and her emotions?
Athena:
You bet I did! And once we expose it, we just might be able to crack her. No, scratch that. Make it, "we'll definitely be able to"!
Phoenix:
Then let's give your knowledge of analytical psychology a try!
Athena:
You got it, Boss! A complete analysis of Ms. DePlume's heart, coming right up!
DePlume:
The killer whale's behavior was exactly the same as a year ago.
DePlume:
As I approached the pool...
DePlume:
...the killer whale suddenly started singing.
DePlume:
I was calm when I saw it start to head-butt.
Pinpoint Fear
Phoenix:
Got it!
Leads to:
"Ms. DePlume, Orla really frightened you with her head-butting, didn't she?"
DePlume:
But when the pirate hat and victim came floating up, I let out a scream!
Athena:
Do you see any emotions that seem odd or out of place? Pay attention to not only which emotions you see, but how strong they are, too. An emotion might suddenly get stronger, for example, or you might see it grow weaker.
Phoenix:
(Okay. Let me listen to her testimony again.)
Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume, Orla really frightened you with her head-butting, didn't she?
DePlume:
Don't be absurd! I certainly was NOT frightened by the likes of any killer whale!
Athena:
It must've been something else that scared her, then, Boss.
DePlume:
However... I do remember being very afraid for some reason while it was doing that. 
Athena:
It sounds like maybe you saw something we haven't discussed yet. Take your time and try to remember what it was... What did you see?
Phoenix:
(This is practically turning into a counseling session.)
DePlume:
............ I... saw something...? ...Oh! Aaaaaaaaaaaagh! I-I remember now!
NOISE LEVEL
50%
Athena:
Okay, good! Now, if you could please tell the court what you saw!
DePlume:
I saw... I saw... I saw... bright red blood! The killer whale's ramming caused the victim to bleed. There was a great cloud of blood!
Phoenix:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
DePlume:
Yes, that's it! That's why I was so sure! That's when I knew that killer whale had killed a person for a second time!
Judge:
Well! That was a very compelling statement indeed. Looking at this again, there does appear to be something that could be a cloud of blood.
Phoenix:
(So her terror was a reaction to blood, was it? That would certainly explain what happened yesterday...)
Phoenix:
Please take a look at this bloodstained coin.
DePlume:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! C-Cease and desist, at once! Wh-What kind of man shows a lady blood?
Phoenix:
Urk. (She doesn't have to get so worked up...)
DePlume:
I was badly injured during an interview once. Ever since then, I've been terrified of blood. The very sight of it dreadfully upsets my delicate sensibilities.
Phoenix:
(This is a bad turn... If Ms. DePlume saw blood... ...then does that mean Orla really did attack the victim...?)
Blackquill:
It would appear that orcas are even more vicious than I am. So, how does it feel to be thoroughly rammed by your own cross-examination, Wright-dono?
Athena:
Wh-What do we do now, Boss?!
Phoenix:
Argh... That testimony was not at all what I expected to hear...
Athena:
Wait a minute... There's still some discord left in Ms. DePlume's heart. 
Phoenix:
What? You mean there's more?
Athena:
Yes, but there's no telling what it is. It could be something even more damaging...
Phoenix:
(Ugh... Is there even anything left of our case to damage...? Well, whatever it is, we have to face it head-on.) Athena, you believe in Orla, right? If so, there's no reason for us to shy away from the truth.
Athena:
...Yeah, you're right!
Phoenix:
I know we can handle the truth, whatever it is, so let's delve a little deeper!
Athena:
You've got it, Boss!
DePlume:
The killer whale's behavior was exactly the same as a year ago.
DePlume:
As I approached the pool...
DePlume:
...the killer whale suddenly started singing.
DePlume:
After it started head-butting, I saw that awful blood and was terrified.
DePlume:
But when the pirate hat and victim came floating up, I let out a scream!
Pinpoint Fear
Phoenix:
Got it!
Leads to:
"Huh? Her fear appears to lessen here at this statement."
Athena:
Do you see any emotions that seem odd or out of place? Pay attention to not only which emotions you see, but how strong they are, too. An emotion might suddenly get stronger, for example, or you might see it grow weaker.
Phoenix:
(Okay. Let me listen to her testimony again.)
Phoenix:
(Huh? Her fear appears to lessen here at this statement.) Ms. DePlume, weren't you afraid when you saw the victim with blood coming out of him?
DePlume:
My, that's a very good question. I was shaken after witnessing a murder, yes, but then... the blood seemed to disappear...
Phoenix:
Disappear? And why do you suppose that was?
DePlume:
Simple! It was because of the pirate hat! After the killer whale put the hat on, the cloud of blood disappeared!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
And how exactly does that work...?
DePlume:
How should I know?! I'm just telling you what I remember, blue boy!
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Consider this."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Maybe somebody else was bleeding in the orca pool, somebody such as this!
Blackquill:
Do you see an injury anywhere on that individual?! And when exactly was this individual supposed to have entered the pool?!
Judge:
I don't think you're ready to play in the deep end just yet, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
I-I'll be right back with some floaties, Your Honor... (Hold on... "Entered the pool"...? What if this individual didn't "enter" the pool, but was already "in" the pool...? Who else was in the pool besides the victim?) 
Leads back to:
"From whom was this blood that Ms. DePlume saw actually coming from?"
Phoenix:
Consider this. Maybe the one who was bleeding wasn't the victim.
DePlume:
I beg your pardon? What kind of ridiculous nonsense is that? There was no one else in that pool beside the victim!
Phoenix:
Oh, I wouldn't say there was no one else. It IS an orca pool, after all.
Blackquill:
What?! Then where is this alleged injury on the defendant?!
Phoenix:
I'm not sure. But if simply wearing the pirate hat made the blood "disappear"... ...then the blood must've been coming from somewhere on Orla's head!
DePlume:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
Blackquill:
The orca's head? What are you prattling on about now?!
Athena:
Please think about it again, Ms. DePlume! Think back to what you really saw!
DePlume:
Errr... I... That is... Th-The one who was bleeding was not the victim, but the killer whale...? Ngh... I remember now! There wasn't any blood coming from the victim after all!

Athena:
We did it! Analytical psychology got us what we needed from her!
Phoenix:
That was a huge help, Athena. (It was also pretty dicey for a while, though.)
Judge:
Well! This is a surprise! The blood the witness saw was the defendant's, not the victim's!
Phoenix:
That is correct. And since there was no blood coming from the victim... ...there's only one thing we can conclude. That what Ms. DePlume witnessed was not the "moment of the murder," as she claims!
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
I thought you were unarmed, but it turns out you were concealing a sword all along. Nevertheless... it is far too dull to cut to the bone. 
Phoenix:
Meaning...?
Blackquill:
I grant that what the witness saw was not the victim's blood, but it proves nothing. After all, being rammed doesn't always result in a wound that bleeds, does it? Death from internal hemorrhaging is also a possibility.
Phoenix:
...! (He has a point there.)
Blackquill:
If you wish to challenge me to a duel, you'll need a sharper blade than that, Wright-dono. I demand evidence that proves the witness did not see the moment of the murder!
Phoenix:
Ack! (There must be something. Think, Phoenix! If I'm correct, then the victim's death occurred...)
Before DePlume saw it
Leads to:
"If the victim was already dead when Orla started her head-butting..."
After DePlume saw it
Phoenix:
(If the victim was alive when Orla started her head-butting... ...then that would basically make Orla the one who killed him. But since I don't think she did it, then we must be wrong about when it took place.)         
Leads to:
"If the victim was already dead when Orla started her head-butting..."
Phoenix:
(If the victim was already dead when Orla started her head-butting... ...then that would mean he died sometime before Ms. DePlume was watching her. The events Ms. DePlume witnessed took place at around 10:10 AM. I must have something that can tell us about what happened before 10:10 AM!)
Present Security Footage
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"We've only seen the footage from 10:09 to 10:10 AM."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This is the evidence that proves Ms. DePlume did not see the moment of the murder!
Athena:
Huh? I'm not sure that's really related to what Ms. DePlume did or didn't witness.
Phoenix:
............But you're not sure, right...?
Blackquill:
No, we can be quite sure it's unrelated.
Judge:
Yes, quite.
Phoenix:
(Ouch. I guess we can be...)         
Leads back to:
"The events Ms. DePlume witnessed took place at around 10:10 AM."
Phoenix:
(We've only seen the footage from 10:09 to 10:10 AM. Which means... there's still footage going further back that we need to check!) Your Honor, I request that ALL of the security footage be played for the court.
Judge:
All of the footage?
Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume witnessed the cloud of blood at around 10:10 AM. But I believe the victim was already dead by that time. 
Judge:
So your assertion is that the murder took place before Ms. DePlume arrived?
Phoenix:
Exactly. The security camera footage starts at 10:00 AM when the aquarium opened. And I believe there is vital evidence in the ten minutes before!
Blackquill:
Hmph............ You are quite the gambling man, Wright-dono. Are you honestly willing to risk everything on those mere ten minutes?
Phoenix:
(I've bet on slimmer chances before, but when he puts it that way...)
Athena:
Athena:
My boss is no coward, Prosecutor Blackquill, so I suggest you get ready to eat humble pie!
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. I can't back down now...)
Judge:
Well, if the defense is that confident in its importance... Prosecutor Blackquill, the security footage.
Blackquill:
............Fool Bright.
Fulbright:
Roger! I have the rest of the security footage right here!
Judge:
Very well. Please play it for the court.
Phoenix:
(Please, PLEASE have something for me!)
Fulbright:
This is what it looked like at 10:10 AM. The witness can be seen here. All right. I'll just back the footage up to the beginning now!
Judge:
Hmm... It appears Ms. DePlume hasn't arrived yet at this point.
Phoenix:
(Now to see if I can find something from before this point in time!)
Judge:
............
Blackquill:
............
Phoenix:
............ Is that it?
Fulbright:
Yep! That's all the footage there is!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Did you see what you were looking for?
Athena:
W-We got nothin'...
Blackquill:
Hmph............ Well, Wright-dono? Those were the ten minutes you placed your bet on. Did you see anything of significance?
Phoenix:
(...Did I see anything important? I'd better think about this carefully...) In the footage, we see...!
Something important
Phoenix:
This is the important thing the footage shows!
Present anywhere
Phoenix:
Judge:
Hmm? And what is so vital about that point, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Different things are important to different people. "Importance" is a subjective thing!
Judge:
Yes, just as my decision to assign a penalty is a "subjective thing."
Phoenix:
Urk. (Wait a minute... What if something that SHOULD be in the footage isn't there...?) P-Please wait, Your Honor! Um... That footage...
Leads back to:
"In the footage, we see...!"
Nothing important
Leads to:
"We can see nothing of importance in that footage."
Phoenix:
We can see nothing of importance in that footage.
Blackquill:
Hmph. Just as I thought. 
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! You're right about that! That section was completely meaningless! It doesn't show a thing. That's why I didn't submit it as evidence!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
No. It's just the opposite.
Fulbright:
Huh? What do you mean by that?
Phoenix:
In this ten minutes of footage, something important that SHOULD be there isn't there! Detective Fulbright, this footage should have been submitted as evidence.
Fulbright:
What? Are you questioning the way I carry out my duty to justice?!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Explain yourself, please! What is this important thing that you say should be in the footage, but isn't?
Present Photo of the Body
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The important thing we should see in the footage is the victim himself, Jack Shipley."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Blackquill:
And what is the problem you perceive if that particular object isn't in the footage?
Phoenix:
There is no problem, which is exactly why it is a problem, right?!
Judge:
While I admire your enthusiasm, please don't think you can wing it on enthusiasm alone. I would further like to suggest that your attitude is a problem, Mr. Wright. 
Phoenix:
...My apologies, Your Honor. (If the victim was alive, there's something we should see in the footage...) I still content that there is something important that is not in this footage.
Judge:
If that is your contention, please back it up with evidence.
Leads back to:
"What is this important thing that you say should be in the footage, but isn't?"
Phoenix:
The important thing we should see in the footage is the victim himself, Jack Shipley. I don't know about you, but I didn't see him get in the pool in that footage.
Judge:
Oh!
Blackquill:
............!
Fulbright:
Aaaaagh! That's right!
Phoenix:
If the victim is not shown entering the pool in this footage... ...it means that he must have been there by the skull rock during those ten minutes. But no human being can hold their breath underwater for that long. 
Fulbright:
W-Wait a minute... Are you saying...?!
Phoenix:
When the security camera started up at 10 AM, the victim was already dead!
Fulbright:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! If that's the case, then when was the victim murdered?!
Phoenix:
I don't know, Your Honor, but we now know it had to have been sometime before 10 AM. Therefore, this footage can no longer be called decisive evidence against my client!
Blackquill:
Hmph. But there is no one else who could have killed the victim. 
Phoenix:
Not necessarily. The defense believes that the true culprit may have been human. And we have evidence to back up our theory as well!
Blackquill:
Do you, now? I would be very interested in seeing this evidence.
Phoenix:
(The defense's trump card -- that thing we found during our investigation yesterday... I wouldn't go so far as to call it "decisive," but... ...now's the time to play it!)
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. Please submit your evidence. What evidence shows that the crime may have been committed by a human?
Present Bloodstained Coin
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"What's this?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
And that substantiates your claim how...?
Athena:
What are you doing?! That's not the right piece at all, Boss!
Phoenix:
...That's what I was just thinking myself, judging by the judge's expression...
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You will refrain from presenting evidence you're not sure about just to feel me out!
Phoenix:
(Ugh... I must still be rusty, but this time, I'll present our real trump card!)        
Judge:
Let's try again, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"What evidence shows that the crime may have been committed by a human?"
Judge:
What's this? A coin...?
Phoenix:
Yes, a fake coin used in the aquarium's pirate show. We found it beside the pool. This coin is quite possibly the real murder weapon.
Judge:
This tiny little coin... is the murder weapon? Mr. Wright! If this is another one of your bluffs...!
Blackquill:
Hmph. As they say, the bolder the presentation, the less confident the solicitor. 
Phoenix:
This is no bluff, and this isn't the only coin. There are 300 of these coins all together, weighing a total of about seven pounds. This one just happens to have blood on it. 
Blackquill:
...Did you have the blood analyzed to see whose it is?
Phoenix:
Not yet... ...but there were coins scattered all around the body, and the victim had a head wound. Taking these things into account, I believe it has to be the victim's blood. So, to put it together, we have about seven pounds of coins by the side of the pool... ...one of them with a bloodstain on it. I think the answer is pretty clear here. Your Honor! The defense proposes that the victim was killed beside the pool! 
Judge:
The side of the pool?! But if the murder took place there, it would be difficult to say the orca did it...
DePlume:
I realize you are trying to defend your client, but that theory is preposterous! How could 300 coins possibly be made to hit someone all at once?!
Phoenix:
It'd be pretty easy if they were in a bag or something of that nature.
Judge:
And so where is this bag the coins were in?
Phoenix:
Unfortunately, Your Honor, we recovered nothing of the sort from the scene. It's possible the culprit took it with them.
Judge:
They took it...?
Phoenix:
The true culprit used the coins as a blunt instrument to commit murder. They then threw the body into the pool before the security cameras started up. And then they left, taking the bag the coins were in with them. They got rid of the evidence that points to a human culprit to pin the blame on Orla!
Athena:
That was brilliant, Mr. Wright! You found a way to introduce the possibility of a human perpetrator!
Phoenix:
Yeah, somehow... (Let's hope my luck holds out... Hmm... I wonder why Prosecutor Blackquill hasn't said anything...)
Judge:
The possibility of a perpetrator other than the defendant has now been suggested. But if we hold this possibility to be true, then what did Ms. DePlume witness?
DePlume:
Th-That's right! I saw the killer whale attack the victim! Just like it did a year ago, singing a song!
Athena:
Hmm... I guess there still is that... Even with somebody else as the culprit, Orla's behavior still seem [sic] pretty bizarre. I wonder why did she [sic] was doing the same things she did a year ago?
Phoenix:
But are they REALLY that bizarre...?
Athena:
What do you mean?
Phoenix:
To explain the inexplicable, all we have to do is turn our thinking around.
Athena:
Turn our thinking around, huh? Sounds good to me!
Phoenix:
(Time to give the ol' "turn my thinking around" method a try! Instead of trying to figure out WHY Orla did the same things she did a year ago... ...I should consider the results that were produced by her behavior this time around. Orla sang a song, did some head-butts, and bit the victim. If the real culprit wanted to shift the suspicion onto Orla... ...then they would've needed to give people a reason to think Orla did it in the first place!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, as her lawyer, how do you explain your client's actions?
Phoenix:
I believe we should think of it in this way, Your Honor: What kind of effect did Orla's actions have on the case?
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Then why don't you explain it for the court. How did the defendant's actions affect the case?
They created a witness
Leads to:
"Ms. DePlume focused her attention on the orca pool because she heard the song."
They killed the victim
Phoenix:
The defendant's actions may have killed the victim.
Judge:
So your assertion is that... the defendant is guilty...?
Phoenix:
Oh! What?! No...! I retract my statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
You may retract your statement, but you will first contract a penalty.
Phoenix:
(Instead of trying to figure out WHY Orla did the same things she did a year ago... ...I should consider what the result was of her doing the same things as a year ago. That's what I have to focus on now!) Your Honor! Please let me try again!
Judge:
Very well. Please explain to the court...
Leads back to:
"How did the defendant's actions affect the case?"
They got rid of evidence
Phoenix:
The defendant's actions may have gotten rid of evidence! 
Judge:
Hmm... And what evidence might that be, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Vital evidence that would prove who the true culprit is! ...At least, that is what I hope.
Judge:
...I am not asking about your hopes and dreams, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Instead of trying to figure out WHY Orla did the same things she did a year ago... ...I should consider what the result was of her doing the same things as a year ago. That's what I have to focus on now!) Your Honor! Please let me try again!
Judge:
Very well. Please explain to the court...
Leads back to:
"How did the defendant's actions affect the case?"
Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume focused her attention on the orca pool because she heard the song. The orca's act of singing a song created a witness. 
Judge:
Created a witness...?
Phoenix:
Isn't it possible... ...that fabricating a witness was the real culprit's true intention? After all, Ms. DePlume witnessed two things: She saw Orla head-butt something over and over, and she saw the orca bite the victim. Those two actions of Orla's might have been... ...the true culprit's plot to make the witness think the orca was attacking the victim!
Judge:
Are you saying... that the defendant was being manipulated by the true perpetrator?! 
Phoenix:
Exactly. And that would explain Orla's actions perfectly.
Judge:
But the defendant is an orca. Is it even possible to manipulate her?
Phoenix:
Yes, there is a way to manipulate Orla's behavior, with this!
Present Whistle
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Is this... a whistle?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
THAT can be used to manipulate Orla's behavior?
Phoenix:
...Sure, maybe it could be, if one knew how!
Judge:
I wish someone would manipulate YOU into presenting relevant evidence, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
M-My apologies, Your Honor... (Hmm... I know I have something that can be used to control Orla's behavior...) 
Judge:
So, Mr. Wright, is it really possible to manipulate Orla's behavior?
Leads back to:
"Yes, there is a way to manipulate Orla's behavior, with this!"
Judge:
Is this... a whistle?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. Trainers at the aquarium use whistles to issues commands to Orla. But in truth, anyone can do it, provided they know the right signals.
Judge:
Ah, that must be how they get Orla to do tricks for their pirate shows.
Phoenix:
The true culprit hid the body in a spot that couldn't be seen from the visitor's corridor. Then, when Ms. DePlume appeared, they gave Orla the commands! In other words, Orla was manipulated by the culprit to perform a series of "tricks"!
DePlume:
Wh-Whaaat...?
Phoenix:
And, as for you, Ms. DePlume... ...you were manipulated by the true culprit to play the part of the witness!
DePlume:
I-I, Norma DePlume, was set up...?! I, Norma DePlume, writer extraordinaire, was used...? N-No... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Judge:
M-Ms. DePlume...! Please do something about your attire!
Phoenix:
(Ugh... That was one wardrobe malfunction I did NOT want to see...)
Judge:
I-It would appear we need to shift our suspicion toward someone other than Orla. Prosecutor Blackquill, please have the bloodstained coin analyzed. 
Blackquill:
...Hmph. You waste your breath.
Phoenix:
(I guess even Prosecutor Blackquill can't refute the possibility of a human suspect.)
Athena:
You did it, Boss! If the crime happened beside the pool, there's no way an orca could have done it!
Phoenix:
Now, if only we could find the bag the coins were in...
Judge:
Hmm... In light of the new discovery, it would appear that the orca couldn't have done it. 
Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor. If the blood on the coin proves to be that of the victim... ...we can unequivocally overturn Orla's accusation.
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
Overturn the defendant's accusation...? Hmph. I think not.
Phoenix:
ACK! (M-My hair! My beautiful hair!)
Blackquill:
Yesterday, a new inmate was brought into the prison. He said, "The moment you relax is when you're most vulnerable."
Judge:
Hmm... And what did this man go in for?
Blackquill:
...He is merely a sneaky thief who enjoys a spot of fishing now and again. But Wright-dono here would be easier to hook than any fish... 
Taka:
*Screech!*
Phoenix:
(That hawk sure does love the judge's head.)
Judge:
What's this? That coin from before and... some sort of bag?
Phoenix:
A b-bag...? (I don't think I'm gonna like this...)
Blackquill:
This is the coin bag the 300 coins were in. I believe you were looking for this?
Phoenix:
H-How did you get that?!
Blackquill:
I never said we didn't find it at the crime scene. The bag had blood on it, so naturally, I had it sent to the crime lab.
Phoenix:
And... does the blood belong to the victim?
Blackquill:
It does indeed, as does the blood on the coin.
Phoenix:
(I knew it! So the blood on the coin DID belong to the victim!)
Blackquill:
The bag was open and the coins had all spilled out. But the bag alone wasn't proof enough to say that it was used as the murder weapon. ...However, thanks to the defense and their coin, I am more than satisfied that it was.
Judge:
Prosecutor Blackquill! Are you conceding that the true culprit committed the murder with the bag of coins?
Blackquill:
I shall concede that the victim was put into the pool after his death. However, even with the bag... ...it doesn't change the fact it was the orca that killed the victim!
Phoenix:
What?! How can you still suspect Orla?!
Blackquill:
You said that the true culprit manipulated Orla's behavior. But Orla isn't the kind of orca that would let someone control her. If anything, Orla used the victim's behavior against him to murder him!
Phoenix:
What?! But--
Judge:
A-Are you arguing that the orca manipulated a human being?!
Blackquill:
Hmph... To prove it, I have summoned another witness. Marlon Rimes, take the stand!
Phoenix:
(M-Marlon Rimes?! Is a witness...?!)
Blackquill:
...Well, don't just stand there. State your name. 
Rimes:
............I told ya I didn't wanna be a witness.
Blackquill:
I thought one witness would be quite enough to prove the defendant's guilt... ...but apparently Wright-dono won't be satisfied until every stone is turned.
Rimes:
Well, son of a... All right, fine! If I gotta talk, then let's get this over with!
Athena:
Mr. Rimes doesn't seem like a willing witness.
Phoenix:
(I wonder what Prosecutor Blackquill is going to have him testify about?)
Judge:
Um... So could we have your name and occupation for the record, witness?
Rimes:
............ Ahoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! People of da law! Time to testify! Chillin' with my crew at the Shipshape. Orcas, penguins, and da seascape. Cleanin' n' feedin', there ain't no end. But dem bratty kid's tours, I shall transcend. Noob animal keeper, from the house of Rimes! I'm da master keeper, Marlon with the rhymes!
Judge:
Oh, my... I'm afraid I couldn't understand a word you said! Is that that "flip-flop" music young people nowadays like?
Phoenix:
(...So close, Your Honor, so close... and yet so far.)
Judge:
Please proceed with your testimony, witness. Without the flip-flop.
Rimes:
Okay, fine. But I don't wanna do this, I tell ya. I feel like I'm sellin' Sasha out.
Witness Testimony
-- The Man-Manipulating Orca -- 
Rimes:
At about 10:10 AM, I was in the staff room.
I heard a loud noise from the pool room, so I went to the door to look in.
I couldn't see the captain or the orca, but I saw a bunch of coins scattered around.
The orca knows there's a certain spot people stand to play volleyball with her.
I think maybe she knocked down the stuff that was piled up there and hit the captain.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... So that gives us a little more info about the area around the orca pool.)
Orca Pool Diagram updated in the Court Record. 
Phoenix:
The defendant made the stuff fall down...?
Blackquill:
Overturned crates and assorted props were scattered all over the pool room floor. There is no doubt that it was the orca that caused the mess. 
Judge:
But could she really have done that from within the pool?
Blackquill:
Hmph. As I said, the orca is the only one that could've perform [sic] such a feat. The pool and its room were tidied the night before, including its various odds and ends. But when our rhyming marlin checked on the scene, over 400 pounds of props had fallen. To move it all in one go would challenge even the brawny prisoner in the cell next to mine.
Phoenix:
(...What is he? The jail gossip?)
Blackquill:
So, how did 400 pounds of items fall all at once? I'll tell you how. The orca pulled on the cloth that was underneath them. A weight that would be all but impossible for a human to move... ...was child's play to an orca. During a friendly game of volleyball, the defendant made the crates fall... ...and the bag of coins that was among the items fell on the victim's head and killed him! The orca then toyed with the victim's body underwater, which is what Ms. DePlume saw. 
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But the witness only said he "heard a loud noise." That doesn't automatically make it the sound of Orla making the items fall! Also, why did you only "look in" on the pool room, anyway, Mr. Rimes?
Rimes:
That orca sometimes makes a loud noise to summon her trainer. But I'm still a newbie, so I don't have a security card to get into the pool room yet. So even if she tries to summon somebody, there isn't much I can do about it. 
Judge:
I see. So the witness couldn't enter the crime scene...
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
If Mr. Rimes couldn't enter the room, there's at least one thing he can't be sure about! His statement that the orca was playing volleyball is purely speculation!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
Whether the orca was actually playing volleyball or not is not the issue. Traces of the orca's saliva were found on the cloth that was underneath the crates. The important point is that the orca is the only one that could have moved the items!
Phoenix:
(Argh! I have to discredit that statement somehow! If I don't, it'd mean that Orla was the culprit, even if the victim died beside the pool!)

Rimes:
What?! Y-Yes, I'm sure! I'm pretty good with time. I've never been late to work once.

(Hmm... If he's sure about the time, then there's something wrong with that statement. I'd better take another look through the Court Record...) 
Judge:
All right. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Rimes.

Phoenix:

"You say you were in the staff room..."
Rimes:
I heard a loud noise from the pool room, so I went to the door to look in.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You heard the noise all the way in the staff room?
Rimes:
That's right. The orca pool room and the staff room are pretty close to each other. Anyway, I heard the noise, so I went to the door of the pool room. But I don't have a security card, so all I could do was look through the door crack.
Phoenix:
What kind of noise did you hear?
Rimes:
Want me to describe it? Awww yiiiiis! Yo word up Courtroom Numbah Fouuuuurrr! Da crash, boom, bowing to relativity! Everything fallin' with sweet simplicity! This testimony yo, it ain't got no fallacies! Things fallin' n' breakin', was pure insanity! ...Kinda like that.
Phoenix:
(Okay... But why the need to rap it...?) 
Judge:
Well, I didn't really get all of that, but, in any case, I gather it was a very loud noise... Very well. Please describe what you saw at the scene.
Rimes:
I couldn't see the captain or the orca, but I saw a bunch of coins scattered around.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You couldn't see the victim?
Rimes:
I was just lookin' through the door crack. I guess all that stuff was blockin' my view. I did notice a whole bunch of coins scattered all over the place, though... But, at the time, I had no idea the captain was dead.
Blackquill:
Hmph... Killed by gold coins. Ironic, isn't it? Perhaps the orca wanted to be paid for her labor, paid in coins raining from the skies.
Athena:
Coins raining from the skies? He makes it sound... almost poetic. 
Phoenix:
But the hard truth is that those coins were actually the murder weapon...
Blackquill:
We all deserve to be paid for our work, do we not? I shall have a fine meal tonight... 
Phoenix:
If you find our client guilty, that is. Mr. Rimes, do you have a theory on how the things got knocked down?
Rimes:
Of course I do.
Rimes:
The orca knows there's a certain spot people stand to play volleyball with her.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
She uses this ball and does a spike, right? We had a nice little demonstration of Orla's spike for ourselves just yesterday.
Rimes:
If you stand on the mark on the floor, the orca spikes the ball at you. 
Blackquill:
Hmph. Taka is good at flying straight at his target as well. And I see plenty of targets right here in this room.
Judge:
?
Phoenix:

Rimes:
?
Athena:
Everyone's so busy protecting their head, they forgot about the trial...
Phoenix:
Including you. 
Blackquill:
Tell them what the defendant caused to happen. 
Rimes:
Well, the orca knows people stand in a certain spot for volleyball...
Rimes:
I think maybe she knocked down the stuff that was piled up there and hit the captain.

Are you saying you think she knocked down the items on purpose?
Rimes:
I don't wanna believe it, myself, but that orca's pretty smart... It'd be easy for her to pull the cloth the stuff was on while she was playin' volleyball. Orcas are really strong. One good pull and all those things would come crashin' down.
Phoenix:
(I guess maybe an orca could be strong enough to make that much stuff fall...) 
Blackquill:
I've never seen an orca play tug of war, myself. But the fact is, this one did. The traces of the orca's saliva found on the cloth prove it. How long do you plan to walk tightrope on those shaky theories of yours?
Phoenix:
(Wait until you see me do acrobatics! Moments like these are what I became a lawyer again for!)
Phoenix:
(I don't know why, but Mr. Rimes is lying. I'm afraid I have to expose that secret he and Pearls were keeping to resolve this...) 
Phoenix:
You say you were in the staff room, but is that really true?
Rimes:
Of course it's true. Why would I lie about a thing like that?
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, have you ever seen this calendar before?
Rimes:
Hey! That's...!
Phoenix:
I see you recognize it.
Rimes:
Yeah, that's the Rifle calendar. It's a big hit at the Shipshape Aquarium gift shop. Thank you for shoppin' at Shipshape! 
Judge:
Mr. Rimes! Please refrain from scattering fish around the witness stand!
Blackquill:
...Not to worry, Your Baldness. Taka will have them cleaned up in no time.
Taka:
*Screech!*
Phoenix:
(...I guess that bird comes in handy now and then.)
Judge:
All right, Mr. Wright. We have all seen your cute souvenir. Now, if you wouldn't mind...
Phoenix:
Uh, no, Your Honor! This isn't my calendar. It was originally the witness's, but it came into the possession of a certain young lady.
Rimes:
Wh-What?!
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes and this young lady first met each other in the food prep room. After a mishap, their calendars got switched around. They ran into each other at about 10:10 AM in the food prep room. So clearly, the witness was not in the staff room. In other words, there's no way he could have heard the noise in the pool room upstairs!
Rimes:
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
Blackquill:
What's this? This is the first I'm hearing about any calendar! 
Phoenix:
(That's because Mr. Rimes and Pearls were keeping it a secret.)
Blackquill:
You lied to ME?! This transgression will not go unpunished!
Rimes:
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
Judge:
So, Mr. Rimes, you didn't hear the noise of the equipment falling after all, did you?
Rimes:
...Okay. I admit it. I didn't hear the noise in the orca pool room myself. But somebody told me about it. 
Phoenix:
Who told you about it?
Rimes:
............It was... uh...
Phoenix:
Unless you tell the truth, Mr. Rimes, I can't save Orla. And I'm sure you know how sad that would make Ms. Buckler.
Rimes:
............ ............I heard about it... from Sasha.
Phoenix:
What?! From Ms. Buckler?!
Athena:
B-But that doesn't make sense!
Phoenix:
(What is going on here?)
Blackquill:
Hmph... Now it's the trainer's own words that drive the orca into a corner. How do you like being bitten by your own client, Wright-dono?!
Phoenix:
(Ugh! I certainly didn't see this coming!)
Blackquill:
What perfect timing. There was something I wanted to ask Ms. Buckler about the orca. The prosecution calls the trainer, Ms. Sasha Buckler, to the stand!
Judge:
Yes, I suppose it would be a good idea to hear what the orca's trainer has to say.
Phoenix:
(I don't know what Sasha is going to say... ...but I'll just have to meet it head-on, whatever it is!)
Judge:
We will take a twenty minute recess while the witness is summoned.
To Be Continued
July 21, 10:39 AM
District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3
Athena:
Mr. Wright... are you going to cross-examine Sasha?
Phoenix:
I guess I'll have to ask her about the noise from the stuff falling down. 
Rimes:
Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, why did you lie?
Rimes:
I... I didn't want Sasha to have to appear in court. I thought if anybody had to testify, I should be the one to do it for her. 
Athena:
But why would you go to all those lengths...?
Rimes:
............ Did you see the entry for the twentieth on that calendar?
Phoenix:
The note about meeting the captain at the orca pool?
Rimes:
Yeah. I found that calendar in the nap room. I think it's probably Sasha's.
Athena:
What?! Then that means...!
Phoenix:
(I guess it does look like more of a woman's calendar than a man's...)
Calendar updated in the Court Record.
Rimes:
I didn't want suspicion to fall on Sasha... Mr. Wright... I gotta go back to the aquarium to look after the orca in Sasha's place. I'll be rootin' for ya on the other end of that TV phone. Please take care of Sasha...
Athena:
Okay! We can't let Prosecutor Blackquill get the best of us! Time to refocus!
Phoenix:
You're right. After all, we're the only ones who can save Orla.
July 21, 11:02 AM
District Court - Courtroom No. 4
Judge:
The court will now reconvene. Prosecutor Blackquill, please call the witness to the stand.
Blackquill:
............Again, you waste your breath. 
Buckler:
Me name be Sasha! And I be one of Cap'n Orla's Swashbucklers! I come to rescue me bucko from the false charges put on her by Dread Pirate Nostache!
Blackquill:
............"Nostache"...?
Athena:
I guess "Nostache" refers to Prosecutor Blackquill this time.
Phoenix:
...Well, it can't be the judge. He HAS a mustache... and a full beard.
Buckler:
Now then, Cap'n Judge... shall we begin the pirate court?!
Judge:
"C-Cap'n Judge"...! Hmm... I rather like that. It makes me feel like a salty old sea dog.
Buckler:
And scene! How was that for a self-intro?
Blackquill:
............The court is not a show. State your full name and occupation. 
Buckler:
I'm Sasha Buckler. I work at Shipshape Aquarium. I perform in our Swashbuckler Spectacular pirate show alongside Orla, as her trainer.
Judge:
Well! You seem like a completely different person now. 
Buckler:
You r-EEL-y think so? Thanks! I was in my pirate show persona just then! Prosecutor Blackquill said I could introduce myself any way I like.
Phoenix:
(I'd bet money he didn't think you were going to do it like THAT...)
Judge:
And what will this witness testify about?
Blackquill:
The orca manipulated the victim into playing volleyball and then knocked the items down. The witness will report about hearing the noise that caused the victim's death. 
Buckler:
Now wait just a minute! Sure, Orla uses the ball to break props sometimes... She even spiked the ball at the giant octopus's leg yesterday when I was cleaning.
Phoenix:
(...So Orla was the one who broke that leg, huh?)
Buckler:
But she couldn't have knocked down that huge stack of equipment with her little ball!
Blackquill:
Hmph. I thought you were paying attention to the trial over the telecast... ...but you apparently know nothing of what we have been discussing. The orca knocked down the equipment by pulling on the cloth that was underneath it. No one said anything about the orca knocking it down with a ball!
Buckler:
Whaaaaaat?! I-Is THAT what we're talking about?! Ngh... I came in here to give Prosecutor Nostache a good keelhauling... ...but I'm the one getting the cat-o'-nine-tails! Ooh, he's as vicious as a tiger shark!
Athena:
Ms. Buckler! Just focus on your testimony and you'll be all right! Don't worry. We'll take care of that tiger shark for you!
Buckler:
Thank you, Athena! Okay, I can do this! My testimony will be fin-omenal!
Judge:
All right, Ms. Buckler. Please proceed with your testimony. 
Witness Testimony
-- Hearing the Noise --
Buckler:
I admit I heard Orla summoning me with a loud noise.
But the aquarium guest's scream I heard over the walkie-talkie was more urgent.
I talked to Norma DePlume first and then went to the pool room with the security guard.
The equipment was everywhere, and... the captain was lying in the middle of it all.
Judge:
Hmm... Her story doesn't seem to be much different from Marlon Rimes's testimony. 
Phoenix:
Or does it...? The circumstances are different. The actual order of Orla's actions depend on the order the witness heard the two noises. If she heard the scream first, the prosecution's claims don't stand up!
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
Hmph. Unfortunately for you, she doesn't remember the order of what she heard.
Phoenix:
............Sh-She doesn't...?
Buckler:
I was distracted at the time... so I don't really recall which one I heard first... I was lost in thought until the guard brought me back to myself... Sorry I'm no help. 
Blackquill:
As long as the order remains unclear, I shall not alter the prosecution's claims. After killing the victim with the bag of coins, the orca toyed with the body in the water.
Phoenix:
(I have to turn things around here somehow! Unless I can prove the sound Sasha heard was NOT the sound of the victim's murder... ...Blackquill's claim that Orla pulled down the equipment to kill the victim will stand. If I want to save Orla, I have to find a contradiction, no matter how small!)
Judge:
Very well. Your cross-examination, please, Mr. Wright.
Cross Examination
-- Hearing the Noise --
Buckler:
I admit I heard Orla summoning me with a loud noise.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
What made you think Orla was summoning you?
Buckler:
Orla knows the sound of her cries doesn't carry far enough. So sometimes she summons people by making a loud noise. Heh heh. That Orla is smarter than the average whale, I tell you!
Blackquill:
Hmph. Taka would not be bested in a battle of wits.
Athena:
Athena:
Wait a minute! Widget is the smartest one of all!
Widget:
Mirror, mirror, on the wall. Who's the smartest one of all? Widget!
Phoenix:
(Am I expected to enter Trucy into this "my kid is better than yours"-apalooza...?) And did you heed the summons of this very intelligent Orla immediately?
Buckler:
I couldn't right away, although I was concerned about her, of course.
Buckler:
 But the aquarium guest's scream I heard over the walkie-talkie was more urgent.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You heard Ms. DePlume scream?
Buckler:
That's right. I heard her through the walkie-talkie of a guard making his rounds. "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!" I can still hear it in my head. It was so loud, I thought it was a sea lion. 
Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume sort of reminds me of a sea lion, actually. 
Athena:
I know, right? Ooh, I should call her "sea lion lady" and see how she likes it!
Phoenix:
(I guess Athena is still upset about being called "yellow girl.")      
Judge:
What did you do after hearing the visitor's scream?
Buckler:
I talked to Norma DePlume first and then went to the pool room with the security guard.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You and the security guard headed to the orca pool room?
Buckler:
Yeah. Apparently, that obnoxious writer lady said she didn't trust me by myself. That's why, after talking to her, the guard and I went to the pool room together. Why the wench be so suspicious?! Arrrrr! I demand a swordfish duel! That's what I felt like saying to her, anyway.
Judge:
............I'm afraid I don't get it.
Athena:
That was a line from the show when Orla and Sasha quarrel with each other! Didn't you do your Swashbuckler Spectacular homework, Your Honor?
Judge:
Why am I getting scolded, Mr. Wright?!
Phoenix:
And why am I getting scolded here, Your Honor...? Ms. Buckler, please tell me what happened after you headed to the pool room.
Buckler:
All right. When the guard and I got there, we saw that...
Buckler:
The equipment was everywhere, and... the captain was lying in the middle of it all.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
What do you recall about the scene exactly?
Buckler:
I don't remember much, to be honest... I was in total shock from seeing the captain like that. If you ask me something specific, I might be able to remember, though.
Phoenix:
(Specific questions, huh? Okay, let's see. What should I ask her about?)      
The things scattered around
Phoenix:
Could you tell me more about the things that were scattered around?
Buckler:
They were equipment and props for the new show.
Phoenix:
The new show?  
Buckler:
Yeah. We were supposed to debut a brand-new Swashbuckler Spectacular yesterday. We already defeated the giant octopus and Nostache, after all. We were going to have a new nemesis, Redstache. He's on the flyer.
Athena:
Oh! That's the flyer Rifle was distributing! "Who will obtain the gold coins hidden in the skull rock?!" Ooh, I wish it could be me!
Buckler:
Leave it to you, Athena, to know all about it! Orla's even got some new tricks for the new show.
Swashbuckler Flyer updated in the Court Record.  
Phoenix:
So all the stuff that fell down was for the new show, is that it? 
Buckler:
That's right. A bunch of props in crates and other equipment, stacked up.
Phoenix:
Your Honor, for the record, I'd like that information added to the witness's testimony.
Judge:
Very well. Ms. Buckler, please append what you just said to your testimony.
Buckler:
Sure thing!
Changes statement "The equipment was everywhere, and... the captain was lying in the middle of it all." to "The props for the new show were everywhere, and... the captain was in the middle of it all."
Jack Shipley
Phoenix:
Could you tell me more about the state you found the victim in?
Buckler:
It's so hard to even think about right now...
Athena:
Sasha is deeply traumatized by the victim's death...
Phoenix:
I guess I shouldn't push her on it, then. (Poor Sasha... She must've really adored him.)
Buckler:
The props for the new show were everywhere, and... the captain was in the middle of it all. 
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
These props for the new show... What kind of things were they?
Buckler:
A blow-up dolphin and anchor, Redstache's costume, the bag of coins... Stuff like that. The captain was wearing his usual costume, and the new props were all there.
Phoenix:
(What [sic] a minute... Something about that doesn't seem right... Is there a problem with Sasha's testimony?)
No, no problem
Phoenix:
(I guess there isn't any particular problem. I'd better get on with the cross-exam.)
Yes, there is
Leads to:
"You say the captain was wearing his "usual costume"..."
Athena:
Do you think Orla really did make that stuff fall down? 
Phoenix:
I think we probably need more information before we can know what really happened. Let's be careful not to let a single inconsistency slip by us.
Phoenix:
You say you the captain was wearing his "usual costume," but is that completely accurate? 
Buckler:
Come on, Phoenix! What are you nitpicking my testimony for?!
Phoenix:
If we look at the body, we see that there's a discrepancy between that and your statement. You stated that the victim was wearing his usual costume. But you'll notice that the victim was wearing a red scarf around his neck. I imagine this red scarf is part of his costume for the new pirate show.
Judge:
Oh, you're right. It's written right here in the flyer for the new show. "Featuring the dashing Redstache, with a fluttering red scarf!" 
Athena:
Although, I have to say, it just looks like a red scarf was added to his OLD costume...
Buckler:
Yeah, well, the captain was never one to spend too much money on costumes... But, you know, the captain wasn't WEARING that red scarf...
Phoenix:
But in this photo, I believe I see a red scarf...
Buckler:
Yeah, but it's not wrapped around his neck. It's just draped on top of his neck. That red scarf was packed away with the rest of the new show's equipment. It must've fallen on top of the captain when the equipment fell down.
Phoenix:
Oh... I see...
Judge:
It looks like your "discrepancy" wasn't really a "discrepancy" after all.
Phoenix:
(So the scarf doesn't have anything to do with the case? But there's something about the timing of the stuff falling that bothers me... Hold on. The timing of the stuff falling... The timing... Maybe... my theory has been all wrong from the beginning! Maybe... the bag of coins isn't the murder weapon!)        
Blackquill:
Heh heh. And so your last cross-examination ends in failure as well. You should know that such a feeble slash will never hurt me.
As I said... the orca made the equipment fall and then toyed with the body in the water.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Blackquill, but based on the circumstances at the scene... ...the defendant couldn't have dragged the body into the water after the equipment fell. 
Blackquill:
...Hmm? And why, pray tell, is that?
Phoenix:
Oh, I'll tell you all right. (If my theory has been all wrong... then I'll just have to fix it!)    
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright. Please do tell the court. What indicates that the body was not dragged into the water after the items fell?
Present red scarf
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"This red scarf fell at the same time as the bag of coins."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Please focus on this point! 
Judge:
That point? I don't see any particular problem there.
Phoenix:
Right here! No... uh, I mean... right AROUND here! To, uh... somewhere over there-ish... And please also take a look at this area over here as well...
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Your "point" is gradually expanding to include the entire photograph!
Phoenix:
(...Okay. I deserved that. The items that fell were props for the new show. A blow-up dolphin and anchor, the bag of coins, the red scarf, swords... If the body was dragged into the pool AFTER the items fell... ...then a certain piece of evidence shouldn't still be in this photograph.) 
Judge:
All right. Please try that again.
Leads back to:
"What indicates that the body was not dragged into the water after the items fell?"
Phoenix:
This red scarf fell at the same time as the bag of coins. But if the body was dragged into the pool after the bag of coins fell... ...then the red scarf wouldn't still be on top of the body! 
Blackquill:
Wh-What...?!
Phoenix:
In other words, the victim was already dead when the equipment came crashing down! Therefore, the bag of coins that fell with the red scarf was NOT the murder weapon!
Blackquill:  
Silence!
Blackquill:
But it was the defense who claimed the bag of coins was the murder weapon to begin with!
Phoenix:
Well... yes, that's true. 
Blackquill:
Do you intend to abandon your original argument?
Phoenix:
After hearing the testimony, I realized my theory about the murder weapon was wrong. Please recall the facts we have learned so far. It's a fact that what Orla bit was the victim's dead body. 
Judge:
After all, when we saw the victim on the security footage, he was already dead.
Phoenix:
But then, Orla carried the victim's body to the side of the pool... ...and knocked down the equipment for the new pirate show that was piled up there. Maybe Orla was trying to alert the humans to the victim's condition. If Orla knocked the items down on the victim after he was already dead... ...then it means the defendant didn't kill the victim with those items!
Blackquill:
BUT THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS! ............Even still, your argument is lacking... If neither the orca's head-butting nor the bag of coins were the manner of death... ...then how do you propose the victim was killed?
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaagh!
Judge:
A very good point. If the defense is now abandoning its original theory... ...then we would need a new theory as to what the murder weapon was.
Phoenix:
Ugh... A-All right... (I doubt "I have no clue" would go over well.)
Athena:
All right! Let's go over what we still need to find out about the victim's body.
Phoenix:
What we don't know is how he died and why his body was at the bottom of the pool. I wonder if there's something that would explain both of those things at once?
Athena:
Hmm... How did the victim's body sink to the bottom of the pool...? On a diagram, it's easy enough to move the body to the bottom of the pool... ...but in real life, the water would just cause the body to float.
Phoenix:
Right... (Hold on... Water? Okay. Then what if we flip that around? What if there was no water? Then the body would go right down in an instant. ...So could the real manner of death be...?!) Thanks for the great hint, Athena. 
Athena:
What? I helped you, and I didn't even know it?!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! I think we know the real manner of the victim's death!
Judge:
"I think" won't do, Mr. Wright. I expect a clear answer. Now then, what was the real manner of Jack Shipley's death?
Phoenix:
(What's the manner of death that moved the victim to the bottom of the pool in an instant?)
Falling
Leads to:
"Please take a look at this diagram of the pool."
Drowning
Phoenix:
We believe the victim drowned, Your Honor.
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
............Autopsy report.
Judge:
Ah, of course! Let's see... Cause of death was "instant death from a brain contusion." Your answer is completely wrong, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
...You're right, Your Honor. Please let me try that again.
Leads back to:
"What's the manner of death that moved the victim to the bottom of the pool in an instant?"
Assault
Phoenix:
We believe the victim was assaulted with a blunt instrument, Your Honor!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
...But nothing like that was found at the crime scene, other than the bag of coins. So if it wasn't the coins, then what was the murder weapon?!
Phoenix:
Um... could we just forget I said that...? You know, about the blunt instrument...?
Judge:
"Forget"...? Very well. I'll try to forget it, but I won't forget to give you a penalty!
Phoenix:
Gah... Please let me try that again.
Leads back to:
"What's the manner of death that moved the victim to the bottom of the pool in an instant?"
Phoenix:
Please take a look at this diagram of the pool. If there was no water in the pool... ...then it would be very easy to move the victim's body to the bottom of the pool. 
Judge:
He would drop straight down... Oh, my! Could that be the true manner of death...?! 
Phoenix:
The orca pool is about 65 feet deep. If the victim were to go from the top of the pool to the bottom when there was no water... ...then he would, without question, have fallen to his death!
Judge:
...Death from a fall...!
Blackquill:
Ngh... And that's your answer...?
Athena:
It all makes perfect sense! If he fell, that would explain the "signs of blunt force trauma all over the body," too!
Phoenix:
The culprit pushed the victim into the pool when there was no water in it. After doing something to keep the body from floating up, they filled the pool with water. The pool water washed away any signs of blood, so no one would realize that he fell!
Judge:
S-Surprisingly, that actually makes sense! Order! Order in the court! I'm just as surprised as you are, but I must have order! If falling was the manner of death, then does that mean the defendant's behavior... ...was the result of being manipulated by the true culprit, as the defense claimed?!
Phoenix:
Yes, it would have to be. All that needs to be explained now is how the real culprit commanded Orla! Ms. Buckler, is there a way to instruct Orla to bite someone? 
Buckler:
What?! What kind of trick would that be?! Of course not!
Phoenix:
Then could you tell us about the tricks Orla does know?
Buckler:
Well, there's jumping, dancing, and playing volleyball. And she can spin, do the rock 'n' roll trick, and sing the Swashbuckler Spectacular song.
Phoenix:
(Those sound like pretty nice tricks, but I doubt they're related to this case.)  
Buckler:
She's also practicing two new, top-secret tricks. There's the "human rocket," where she shoots somebody up into the air. And then there's the "lifesaver" trick, where she brings a drowning person to the surface.
Phoenix:
(Hey! One of these "top-secret" tricks might have something to do with the case! Now, which of these two tricks sounds relevant to the case?)     
The human rocket trick
Phoenix:
The human rocket trick shoots a person up into the air. That means Orla shot the victim's body, which had sunk to the bottom, up to the surface! 
Judge:
Hmm... Are you implying that's how the victim's body got to the surface? In that case, when did the bite marks get onto the victim's clothes?
Phoenix:
Huh? (Oops. I forgot about those.)     
Judge:
I can't accept your theory unless it explains all of the circumstances of this case.
Phoenix:
(Orla has two "top-secret" tricks. The human rocket trick, where she shoots somebody up into the air. And the lifesaver trick, where she brings a drowning person to the surface.)     
Leads back to:
"Now, which of these two tricks sounds relevant to the case?"
The lifesaver trick
Leads to:
"So, in the lifesaver trick, Orla brings a drowning person to the surface, correct?"
Phoenix:
So, in the lifesaver trick, Orla brings a drowning person to the surface, correct? 
Buckler:
You cod it! Orla's still learning how to hold someone gently in her mouth... ...so she sometimes bites into their clothes, but she's never hurt a person's skin. 
Athena:
She brings a drowning person to the surface?! Then that must be it...!
DePlume:
And then the killer whale swam up toward the surface with the victim in its mouth!
Judge:
That matches up perfectly with what Ms. DePlume said in her testimony!
Phoenix:
The real culprit must have used the lifesaver trick command to manipulate Orla!
Judge:
Hmm... I still find this very hard to believe. 
Phoenix:
Then let's see it for ourselves. Let's have Orla show us her trick using a practice dummy.
Blackquill:
...Hmph. As you wish. 
Judge:
The prosecution doesn't appear to have any objection. Ms. Buckler, please proceed.
Buckler:
Okay, sure! I'll show you Orla's fin-omenal trick! Hey, Marlon! Are you ready over there?
Rimes:
Okay, lemme just go get the practice dummy... ...There! It's in the pool! Ready and standin' by, Sasha!
Buckler:
Here goes! Orla's secret new trick, the lifesaver!
Anime cutscene
Rimes:
The clothes got torn up a little, but the dummy doesn't have any new marks on it!
Orla:
Fwee, fweet! Fwee, fweeeeet!
Buckler:
And there you have it! Orla's secret new trick!
Man:
Wow! That orca is really something!
Woman:
A cute thing like that wouldn't hurt anybody!
Phoenix:
(Sounds like the gallery loved Orla's performance!)   
Athena:
That was great! That awesome trick captured everybody's heart!
Judge:
Ho ho ho! Wonderful! I wish I could see more!
Blackquill:
............
Athena:
Looks like we silenced Prosecutor Blackquill!
Phoenix:
Thank you, Orla and Ms. Buckler. And thank you, too, Mr. Rimes. And so now you can clearly see that Orla was manipulated. The bottom of the orca pool needs to be examined immediately! We might still find some evidence of the victim falling to his death!
Judge:
Prosecutor Blackquill, please have that taken care of at once!
Blackquill:
............
Judge:
Uh, excuse me, Prosecutor Blackquill, but I am requesting further investigation...
Blackquill:
............ GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Fulbright:
Tsk, tsk, Prosecutor Blackquill! You have to answer the nice judge politely! Oh, that's right! I almost forgot! The thing you asked for just came in.
Blackquill:
Ngh... And you couldn't be bothered to think of a less violent way to deliver it...?
Phoenix:
(What did Prosecutor Blackquill ask for?)   
Blackquill:
Hmph............ I've been waiting for this.
Judge:
Oh? And what is that?
Blackquill:
............An updated autopsy report.
Phoenix:
What?! Why did it have to come now?!
Blackquill:
During the recess, I ordered the body to be re-examined. Something started nagging at me during the course of the trial, you see. ............Here. 
Judge:
I take it you'd like me to read it? Very well. "Cause of Death: Thought to be from 65-foot fall"!
Shipley's Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.      
Judge:
B-But this...! But this is decisive evidence that substantiates Mr. Wright's theory!
Phoenix:
What?! (It's something... GOOD for a change?!)      
Judge:
If the manner of death was falling into an empty pool, the orca can't be responsible. It seems Orla's complete innocence has been proven. 
Blackquill:
Hmph............ I suppose I can't deny that. 
Athena:
This is fantastic! You did it, Mr. Wright! Prosecutor Blackquill isn't even trying to refute it! Orla is saved!
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah... (Is it really safe to celebrate...?)      
Judge:
It would appear more investigation into this case is necessary. But first allow me to render my verdict. The court finds the defendant Ora Shipley...
Not Guilty
Buckler:
You did it! Thank you so much, Phoenix! Thank you, Athena! Orla and Marlon thank you, too!
Rimes:
Congrats, Sasha!
Orla:
Fwee, fweet!
Rimes:
Time to celebrate! Go on! Eat up!
Orla:
Fwee, fwee, fweet!
Athena:
Hee hee! Glad to see everybody so happy! And I'm absolutely thrilled about the verdict!
Blackquill:
............ ...Thank you, Wright-dono. 
Phoenix:
Huh?! For what?
Blackquill:
Hmph... The drained pool... Thanks to you, the truth is finally clear. Fool Bright............ Arrest this woman. 
Fulbright:
Certainly! Right away, Prosecutor Blackquill! Sasha Buckler, you are hereby under arrest for the murder of Jack Shipley!
Buckler:
WHAAAT?!
Phoenix:
Wh-What are you talking about?! What reason could you possibly have?!
Blackquill:
Come now. You must have had some idea in the back of your dull, little mind. The true culprit manipulated the orca in order to have false charges brought upon her. ...And who is the only one with the ability to accomplish that? It can only be the orca's trainer!
Phoenix:
But I'm sure there's some other explanation!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
I don't need any of your baseless counterarguments... Have you forgotten? In order to enter the orca pool room, a security card is necessary. A security card that only the victim and Sasha Buckler possessed! Ms. Buckler is the only one who could have caused the victim to fall to his death!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaagh!
Judge:
Wh-What?!
Athena:
No! I don't believe it! Ms. Buckler was so upset by Mr. Shipley's death! She couldn't have done it!
Blackquill:
............Fool Bright. 
Fulbright:
We asked the security company yesterday to check their security card logs. Their report just came in during the recess. The night before the incident, Sasha Buckler used her card to enter the orca pool room. After that, not a single person entered the pool room! Not until the incident was discovered, when Ms. Buckler and the guard ran in.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But no one would commit murder where their card usage was being recorded!
Fulbright:
Apparently, the aquarium employees don't know that their card usage is tracked. What's more, Ms. Buckler was seen arguing with the victim before the incident. So, Ms. Trainer, what were you arguing about?
Buckler:
It was... a private matter... But it wasn't anything I would kill him over! That's ridiculous!
Blackquill:
Ms. Buckler is the only one who entered the room, and she knows how to command Orla. Besides, I thought her suspicious from the very beginning.
Phoenix:
You suspected Ms. Buckler from the start?
Blackquill:
The orca did tricks because someone commanded her to do so. Possibly someone with a heart so black as to make her own partner the murder weapon! The possibility the orca killed the victim... The possibility a human manipulated the orca... I looked into both.
Phoenix:
(So he suspected both Sasha and Orla all along...)
Blackquill:
Hmph... My gratitude to you. After all... ...you were the one who drew out that information about the lifesaver trick. The orca you saved was an unwitting victim. A victim made to look like the weapon that killed Jack Shipley.
Phoenix:
Ungg... N-NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Fulbright:
All right, come along, then. Let's have a good, long talk...
Buckler:
Wait! I didn't kill the captain! And I would never try to frame Orla! Why would I hurt the ones I love like that?! 
Athena:
Sasha...!
Buckler:
Phoenix! Athena! You gotta believe me! I--
Athena:
Sasha didn't kill him! I believe that with all my heart! There's gotta be something we can do!
Phoenix:
(I feel the same way... Could I have done something differently? But never in my wildest dreams did I imagine things turning out like this!)
Judge:
Hmm... It would appear that this case has taken on an entirely new suspect. But this trial is only concerned with a ruling on the defendant, Ora Shipley. So I'm afraid this concludes today's trial. Court is adjourned!
To Be Continued
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This piece of evidence clearly exposes the witness's lie!
Judge:
It does? In what way...?
Blackquill:
It does indeed expose something... the defense's boneheadedness. There is nothing untoward about that evidence, no matter how you bluster.
Judge:
I agree. There is nothing compelling in that evidence.
Phoenix:
(I'm definitely losing the judge's confidence in me here...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What is your opinion on the witness's statement just now?
Judge:
My opinion? My opinion is that there is nothing wrong with it.
Phoenix:
Oh... This is my first trial in eight years. It looks like I made a little mistake...
Judge:
That is no excuse, Mr. Wright. I should give you eight years' worth of penalties! 
Phoenix:
(It's been eight years. Can't he go easy on me?)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That statement is clearly inconsistent with this evidence, Your Honor!
Blackquill:
I hope you don't think waving your finger about aimlessly... ...is going to help you win this trial!
Judge:
Hmm... I agree. I see nothing inconsistent with that evidence.
Phoenix:
Urk! (I must have the wrong evidence...)
Consult (when evidence must be presented)
Athena:
Mr. Wright! I think I have something here!
Phoenix:
You sensed something wrong with the testimony?
Athena:
That's right. Let me show you which statement I thought was strange!
Phoenix:
Thanks. That would be a big help! (Then I'll just have to compare the evidence with the statement she shows me!)
Consult (when statements must be pressed)
Athena:
Mr. Wright, I don't see any inconsistencies in the testimony. This might be a good time to--
Phoenix:
Press for more information? I think you're right. 
Athena:
I just can't help but feel that there's more to this statement than meets the eye.
Phoenix:
(I'll put my faith in Athena and press on that statement, then!)
Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment "What I Saw and What I Heard")
Phoenix:
Got it!
Phoenix:
When we view your emotions alongside your testimony, we find the unexpected emotion-- (Wait a minute... There really isn't anything strange here.)    
Athena:
I don't know, but I think maybe we made a mistake, Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
......I think maybe you're right.
Athena:
Let's take another look! There must be an unexpected emotion here somewhere!
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Ora Shipley...
Guilty
