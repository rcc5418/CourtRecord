Wright Anything Agency
Apollo:
...What a train wreck that was. I'm glad we made it out of that trial alive.
Trucy:
Really? I had fun! And Wocky made it through the day, too!
Apollo:
...Everyone was too obsessed with panties to bother with the real case.
Trucy:
But it was good publicity! Imagine the crowd at my show tonight! You should come, Polly!
Apollo:
Yeah...
Trucy:
The Amazing Mr. Hat will be making an appearance!
Mr. Hat:
Hi, folks! I'll be here all week!
Apollo:
That's about enough of him.
Alita:
Hello...?
Trucy:
Ah! Ms. Tiala!
Alita:
Thank you for today. The trial... went well.
Apollo:
Oh, right! No problem!
Alita:
Do you think Wocky will be OK?
Apollo:
(Well, he's not guilty... yet.)
Alita:
Please, you have to help him! We're supposed to get married next month...
Apollo:
Oh, congratulations! (Gah, way to put the pressure on a guy...)
Alita:
Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help!
Examine
Bookshelf
Apollo:
Some magic books are mixed in with the law books here. The magic books all look well-used, but the law books are just gathering dust. ...I feel kinda sorry for them. Maybe I'll read some next time I'm around.
Charley the plant
Apollo:
It's Charley, the houseplant. They've had it for years, apparently.
Trucy:
That's "Mr. Charley" to you! He's been here longer, after all.
Apollo:
...Right, sorry.
Trucy:
I'm sorry, Mr. Charley. He was raised by a tribe of heathens.
Apollo:
(She's saying something to the plant as she waters it...)
Trucy:
Mr. Charley forgives you. This time.
Apollo:
...Is there anything else I might do to please His High Leafiness?
Hula hoop
Apollo:
A giant hoop used to levitate people. So, tell me, how does it work?
Trucy:
Apollo... Don't you know you should never ask a magician to explain a trick? I mean, you're hardly better than Mr. Stickler!
Apollo:
Hey, I object to being placed in the same category as that panty-snatcher.
Trucy:
Enjoy the mystery! That's the way to appreciate magic.
Magic split box
Apollo:
Those boxes frighten me.
Trucy:
I bet I'm the first magician to figure out these make great shelves!
Apollo:
(She does seem to be putting them to good use...) But, if you ever want to put it back together, you have to take everything off.
Trucy:
... Don't worry, I'll clean it up soon... and then we'll try cutting you up!
Apollo:
Th-Thanks, but I'll pass.
Photograph
Apollo:
An old, sepia-tone photograph of a man in a silk hat. His outfit looks a lot like Trucy's, come to think of it.
Trucy:
Aren't those clothes the best? I had mine made to match! If you're going to be a magician, you gotta look the part!
Apollo:
(Trucy is big on appearances, I've found...)
Piano
Apollo:
There are all sorts of strange paraphernalia sitting on top of the piano. It seems a shame to have all these props and not do a trick or two.
Trucy:
You asked for it!
Mr. Hat:
Heeeey, Mr. Righteous, was it? Wakka wakka!
Trucy:
"Justice", Mr. Hat! "Apollo Justice".
Mr. Hat:
Just is? Apollo just is what? That's what I want to know!
Trucy:
Oh, you're hopeless!
Apollo:
...Please, make it stop.
Trucy:
Just let me know if you ever want a visit from Mr. Hat!
Apollo:
Any other trick but that one, please...
Silk hat
Apollo:
A blue silk top hat, just like the one Trucy's wearing.
Trucy:
It's my trademark color! "Trucy Blue"!
Apollo:
I don't think you can trademark the color blue.
Trucy:
Standing out is everything when you're up on stage! Bet you didn't know you've got your own color, too, Apollo! "Crimson Justice"!
Apollo:
You make me sound like some second-rate superhero.
Trucy:
At least it's better than being a first-rate super zero!
Spaghetti
Apollo:
A dish of plastic spaghetti like some restaurants put on display. Where did you get this, anyway?
Trucy:
It was a birthday present from Daddy! I was so happy... You don't know how long I wanted one of these! I fell asleep with it, cradled in my arms, and the spaghetti bent!
Apollo:
(Mental note: What she really wants for her next birthday: A bowl of plastic food...)
Table
Apollo:
A hot water pot sits on a magic table. Why is the stand for this table so flimsy looking?
Trucy:
...Hmm. Maybe it looks better that way?
Apollo:
...I was hoping for a more professional explanation.
Trucy:
Well... Maybe to show that there's no tricks involved?
Apollo:
... Not bad.
Trucy:
I still think it's just that it looks better that way.
Talk
Marriage
Apollo:
Are you sure about marrying into the Kitaki Family...?
Alita:
I'm fine with it. And I love Wocky with all my heart.
Trucy:
Aw, that's so sweet!
Apollo:
So it doesn't bother you that you'll be, erm... ...Married to the mob?
Alita:
I don't think so... My parents are against it, of course.
Trucy:
Say! Where did you and Wocky first meet, anyway?
Apollo:
(Good question... Ms. Tiala doesn't look like the type to have gangster connections...)
Alita:
Oh... We met at my old job, actually.
Trucy:
Ah, office romance!
Alita:
...
Apollo:
(She's not very forthcoming with information about herself, is she?)
The Kitakis
Alita:
Did you know that the boss is trying to get out of the "business"?
Apollo:
R-Really? (Mr. Kitaki wants to quit being a gangster!?)
Alita:
He's trying to transfer his assets into a normal company. He only announced it recently, out of the blue... I hear there's quite a lot of confusion in the ranks.
Apollo:
(Hmm. I wonder if this explains that apron?) ...I can't imagine Wocky going along with that.
Alita:
Hee hee. He's highly motivated, isn't he?
Apollo:
Um, that's not the word I would have used.
Alita:
He said, "I'll be the next Big Boss, and keep the Family alive." I think he's at that age when boys want to make a mark on the world.
Apollo:
(That's not the way I would have put it...)
Alita:
His father moves in a lot of circles... He's really focused on profits. The Kitaki Family's been making a killing recently!
Apollo:
(Again, not the way I would have put it...)
Alita:
But Wocky says it's not about the money. They have the gangster tradition to uphold.
Trucy:
Ooh, a generation gap! They've even got the ever classic "what about the family business" thing going...
Apollo:
Usually, it's the father worried about tradition...
Wocky's operation
Apollo:
Can I ask you a question about Wocky? I understand he was operated on by the victim, Dr. Meraktis.
Alita:
Apparently, yes.
Wocky:
I was in his clinic 'bout half a year ago. He messed up my op something bad. And then he just lets me go, without a word. See ya later, bye! So I gotta go in, get another doc to patch me up again!
Alita:
...Yes, it sounded horrible. Wocky has always been fond of fighting, I'm afraid...
Apollo:
I'm not sure it qualifies as "fighting" when pistols are involved.
Trucy:
Mr. Gavin was saying his life might be in danger, wasn't he?
Alita:
N-No, that can't be right! I'm sure he was just trying to scare us.
Trucy:
It's scary to think that a surgeon might make a mistake... ...but it's even scarier when he tries to hide it!
Apollo:
(I'd like to know a little more about this "operation". Maybe it's time to pay the Meraktis Clinic a visit.)
Present
Anything
Alita:
I'm sorry, I don't know much about the case. I... I feel so helpless. You're my only hope. Please, help my Wocky-Pocky...
After clearing all Talk options:
Alita:
I should be getting home now. Wocky's in your hands, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
R-R-Right! L-L-L-Leave it to me!
Trucy:
Apollo, I think you're only making her more nervous...
Apollo:
Sorry! I'm new at this, OK?
Alita:
Tee hee. It's alright. I believe in you.
Hickfield Clinic
Examine
Bottle
Apollo:
A bottle of Mr. Wright's favorite brand of grape juice. Me? I haven't been able to touch the stuff since that first case. ...Not a problem for Mr. Wright, apparently.
DVD stack
Apollo:
A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. Better stay away or it'll become a crashing cascading cavalcade of DVD cases.
Hospital bed
Apollo:
Mr. Wright's bed. My, it's messy. Trucy must clean up after him at home.
Piano
Apollo:
A toy piano, one that might be played by a child. Correction: A pink toy piano. I guess the man likes pink. Nothing wrong with that.
Television
Apollo:
The TV's been left on. Hmm... Looks like the Steel Samurai's in a spot of trouble. I'm sure he'll come back to win in the end. Mr. Wright likes those kind of stories.
Kitaki Mansion
Examine
Spilled paint
Apollo:
Several colors of paint have been splashed across the gate. Most of it's pretty much dry, too. This is going to be one heck of a cleanup job.
Old Lady
Apollo:
Looks like the old lady's at it again...
Officer:
Look, I told you yesterday the park's off limits!
Old Lady:
And I told you yesterday this is how I go home! OK. You want me to go around? How about giving me five bucks... like yesterday.
Apollo:
(...The con artist strikes again...)
Police officer
Apollo:
The park crime scene is off limits to the public. The police officer on guard by the gate is yawning. Ah, he noticed me staring and snapped his mouth shut. Too late, Mr. Officer! I saw you!
Trash can
Trucy:
This trash can... This is where we found the mirror!
Apollo:
Come to think of it, wasn't there something else in here? Something near the bottom... ...Look at the paint on these. That means... ...these must have ended up in here after Mr. Wright's accident. Maybe they're connected? Let's pick them up.
Slippers added to the Court Record.
Trash can (subsequent times)
Apollo:
A large trash can sits by the entrance to the park.
Trucy:
What, you aren't going to dig through it?
Apollo:
No. What? I'm serious! I have no intention of looking through this trash can!
Trucy:
Oh, please, don't hold back on my account.
Apollo:
I think that whatever you think about me and trash cans, you're wrong.
Examine evidence
Slippers
Toe print
Apollo:
I wonder... Could this be a print?
Trucy:
Why would there be a finger... Oh, you mean a toe print! Good call, Apollo!
Apollo:
I bet we can analyze it just like a regular print.
Trucy:
This could be a vital piece of evidence!
Obtain toe print
Leads to:
"Hey! It worked! That looks like... a big toe, maybe?"
Apollo:
Hey! It worked! That looks like... a big toe, maybe?
Trucy:
Wow, I feel like the case is solved already!
Apollo:
What was next? We have to match the print, right?
Trucy:
Right! Let's match it! ...... Wait. The detective didn't give us a list of toe prints, Apollo.
Apollo:
Oh, good point.
Trucy:
Maybe we should ask her? Get some "expert" advice?
Apollo:
I guess so... (I'm not sure she really qualifies as an expert...)
Toe print (subsequent times)
Apollo:
So, we have a toe print now.
Trucy:
I'm not sure what good it's going to do us without a list of toe prints to check it on.
Apollo:
(Maybe our detective friend can help us...)
People Park
Examine
Blue tarps
Apollo:
Blue plastic tarps cover the ground around the stand. They were apparently put here to preserve the crime scene.
Knife
Apollo:
A knife is sticking straight into the ground. Remember what Wesley Stickler said in the trial today... Wocky was very likely pointing this at the victim.
Trucy:
...Like he wanted to kill him.
Apollo:
(Yeah, that's the problem.)
Mannequin
Apollo:
A mannequin put in place of the body. I think I've seen him by the police station. The way he's forced to look at the ground now, day in and day out... It's kind of sad.
Noodle stand
Apollo:
Poor Mr. Eldoon. His stand's been standing here since this whole thing started.
Trucy:
It almost looks at home here in the park now. I think it should be made into a playhouse for children!
Apollo:
I think its owner would disagree.
Trash can
Apollo:
A trash can sits next to the path here.
Trucy:
And I guess now we know it was Mr. Stickler who hid Little Plum's bloomers here, huh?
Apollo:
That's right, Trucy. And what a web of lies grew from that one little act.
Trucy:
I can still remember that moment... You brandished those bloomers on high, and shouted... "Objection!"
Apollo:
...Here's what I want you to do, Trucy. Take that memory, gently lock it away deep in your heart, and never speak of it.
Eldoon's House
Examine
Clinic front door
Apollo:
The front entrance to the Meraktis Clinic. The walls and posts are so highly polished I can see my face in them. ...Wait. My hairdo's a little flat. ...There. Perfect.
Bowl
Apollo:
A lone Eldoon's Noodles bowl lies on the ground. The lone bowl, tipped on its side... It's kind of surreal. You'd think he would have picked it up by now.
Oil drum
Apollo:
An oil drum for catching rainwater. ...Ack! A flock of crows just flew over and... That's gross! Their aim was uncanny... almost as if they'd been practicing here a long time.
Meraktis Clinic - Garage
Examine
Tailpipe
Apollo:
This is where we found your panties, isn't it, Trucy?
Trucy:
And I can't thank you enough, Apollo!
Apollo:
Well, thank you for saying thank you!
Trucy:
Oh, I'm always polite! It's part of being a performer. You know what Daddy says: "It doesn't cost anything to be polite, and it could bring you more business."
Apollo:
...Typical.
Trucy:
Just kidding! I really am grateful!
June 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Trucy:
Hmm... Looks like Wocky's out for questioning.
Apollo:
I really need to talk to him. I guess we'll come back later.
Guard:
Excuse me.
Apollo:
Yes?
Guard:
The other suspect is all through with questioning, sir.
Trucy:
The other... Ah! You mean the panty-snatcher!?
Apollo:
...Wesley Stickler. (So they arrested him, too?) Alright. Let's have a little chat with Mr. Stickler. (I hope I don't regret this.)
Trucy:
He is a valuable witness!
Apollo:
(He is a bit "precious", I'll give him that.)
Stickler:
Please, keep this brief, if you would. I'm quite busy. I need to finish this paper... Nyurk! I-It's you!!!
Apollo:
...Mr. Stickler. We'd like to have a few words with you.
Stickler:
...... ...Very well. As long as they're few.
Apollo:
(Nothing would make me happier, believe me.)
Talk
Panty-snatcher
Apollo:
Mr. Stickler. On the night of the murder, you stole...
Stickler:
Wait! I can't help but feel that I'm being misunderstood.
Apollo:
...How, exactly?
Stickler:
Yes, that night, I obtained a pair of panties, it's true. However! It was my burning curiosity that drove me to do it! Nothing more!
Trucy:
You wanted to know the trick to my panties, right?
Stickler:
Y-You're here, too!?
Trucy:
...?
Stickler:
Oh, Great Trucy! Teach me!
Trucy:
Eh!?
Stickler:
I must know the secret of your panties! My very existence hangs in the balance! Please, make me your apprentice!
Trucy:
Apollo! Help!
Apollo:
I dunno, I think he'd make a great "lovely assistant".
Trucy:
Don't say that, Apollo...
What you witnessed
Apollo:
Could you relate what you saw the night of the murder to us one more time?
Stickler:
...Why not. Though it hardly differs from the testimony I gave in court. The defendant was there in the park that night, of this I'm quite certain. He was pointing a pistol... or 
something like that at the victim! That's when I shouted "Stop, you two! Let's resolve this like gentlemen!" ...And the next moment, a shot was fired.
Apollo:
And this is all true? Really?
Stickler:
My panties are gone. My innermost heart revealed. What further reason could I possibly have to lie?
Apollo:
(I can't think of anything he'd want to hide more than panty-snatching, true.)
Trucy:
It sounds like Wocky was at the scene of the crime, after all.
Apollo:
How I wish it weren't so.
Present
Trucy's Panties
Stickler:
Th-That's it! The mystery! The unanswerable riddle!
Trucy:
Actually, they're just a normal pair of panties.
Stickler:
Wh-What!? How is that possible?
Trucy:
It just takes practice, that's all.
Stickler:
Then you must teach me! You must! To think, if I could produce a pencil, an eraser, a text book, and a lunch... ...all from a pair of panties! My life would be complete!
Apollo:
(He's serious, isn't he.)
Anything else
Apollo:
... (...Fine, ignore my evidence. See if I care. I wonder what he's thinki... On second thought, let's not go there.)
Wright Anything Agency, after clearing all Talk options with Alita Tiala and Wesley Stickler
Talk
The case
Trucy:
If everything that panty-snatcher said was true... ...it doesn't put Wocky in a very good position, does it?
Apollo:
He was at the scene of the crime, that's pretty clear. (There's got to be a different angle on this...)
Trucy:
Well, let's get investigating! No time like the present!
Any leads?
Apollo:
So? Any leads?
Trucy:
Hmm... One moment... ... Shazam! Allakhazam!
Apollo:
(Whoa! Evidence keeps flying out of nowhere!)
Trucy:
Ta da! That's all! Neat, huh?
Apollo:
...Yeah, real neat. (*sigh*)
Present
Trucy's Panties
Trucy:
Aren't my panties amazing? They were a big hit in court.
Apollo:
(They were the star player of the day, that's true.)
Trucy:
What should I show them in court tomorrow?
Apollo:
(If only I could count on panties to save the day every day...)
June 16Kitaki Mansion
Apollo:
(Yipes! She's back!)
Plum:
Hey. You two. Over here!
Apollo:
U-Uh, us?
Trucy:
Yo, Little Plum! Wassup!?
Apollo:
(I think all this gangsterese is a negative influence on Trucy...)
Plum:
I heard you retrieved my bloomers!
Apollo:
W-Well, I was j-just doing...
Plum:
Bah! A man speaks clearly, and takes credit where it's due! You caught the thief, didn't you?
Apollo:
Uh, y-yes! Sorry! I caught him!
Trucy:
You're cute when you're nervous, Polly!
Apollo:
...I'll deal with you later.
Plum:
But enough about bloomers! What about my son, Wocky!?
Apollo:
W-Wocky? Er, well, he's, um...
Plum:
Clearly!
Apollo:
Y-Yes, ma'am! (This is why I was kind of hoping we could avoid coming back here.)
Talk
Wocky
Trucy:
He's really everything you'd expect in a Boss's son! "I'm going to be a gangster, dude!"
Plum:
The life does have an appeal for that age... Particularly for boys.
Trucy:
...
Apollo:
What? Don't look at me like that!
Plum:
He was shot in a turf war about half a year ago.
Apollo:
Yes... We heard the story from Wocky.
Plum:
...But he didn't tell you the whole story. You know, even if he had a pistol then, he couldn't have shot anyone.
Trucy:
What...?
Plum:
He acts like he's "hard", but he couldn't shoot someone to save his life. I should know... I'm his mom.
Apollo:
(Her words do have a certain weight to them...)
Plum:
Hopefully, when this is all taken care of... ...he and the Boss can sort out their differences.
Trucy:
The Boss... You mean Wocky's father?
Apollo:
They didn't seem to be on the best terms, did they?
The case
Plum:
It's true... One of our pistols is missing.
Trucy:
So the murder weapon was from this mansion...
Apollo:
We kind of figured, given the difficulty of obtaining a gun these days.
Plum:
None of the rank and file have access. Only the Boss, myself, and ...Wocky could have taken it.
Apollo:
I see...
Plum:
I'm sure the cops will continue tromping all over the mansion because of this case. Maybe this is a sign that it's time for a change! Wa ha ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
(She doesn't seem too concerned, at least.)
Alita Tiala
Plum:
...Yeah. Wocky's fiancée.
Apollo:
They're getting married next month, correct?
Plum:
I suppose. She's been staying over lately.
Trucy:
...You don't look too happy about that, Little Plum.
Plum:
...! How'd you guess?
Apollo:
(Even I could tell that!) Could you tell us more about her?
Plum:
...Wocky brought her home one day. Says he wants to tie the knot.
Trucy:
I can see why! She's so pretty!
Plum:
Oh, she's pretty enough. But, you know...
Trucy:
...?
Plum:
Nah, it's probably just me being suspicious. Stay in this business too long... ...and you start to only see darkness in people. You get a nose for it. A nose for people... A nose for trouble.
Apollo:
(Hmm. I wonder what the problem is?)
Trucy:
It's like a gangsters-only version of "female intuition"!
Father and son (appears after "Wocky")
Plum:
The Boss may act tough, but that boy means the world to him.
Apollo:
But Wocky seems, well... It seems like he's against his father's position.
Plum:
Ah. It's to be expected. We're in a bit of a transition now. Trying to cut our ties to the shadier side of the street and do more on the up-and-up. Wocky isn't too enthusiastic about the change, it's true.
Trucy:
But why the change? Is the gangster thing just not paying the bills?
Plum:
Wa ha ha ha ha ha! It pays... but we need a lot of money right now. Clean money, that is.
Apollo:
I see... (Hmm, something must be up.)
Plum:
He'll see things the way the Boss sees 'em... some day.
Present
Mirror
Apollo:
This is the mirror we found...
Plum:
...From the hit 'n' run, huh? It's funny how it all ties together like this. You chase after a hit 'n' run and end up Wocky's attorney. Of course, you'll find the real killer soon. Won't you.
Little Plum's Bloomers
Apollo:
Um, about these...
Plum:
Hey, my bloomers! Thanks for that. I owe you one.
Apollo:
Um, I thought you might like them back, so...
Plum:
Eh? Oh no, no. Why don't you keep 'em as a souvenir?
Apollo:
Oh no, I couldn't, really! Thanks for the offer bu--
Trucy:
I could use those in my Magic Panties act! I'll pull shivs and pieces and godfathers out of them!
Apollo:
Great, now your props are going from bland to dangerous.
Knife
Apollo:
Can you tell me if this knife belongs to Wocky?
Plum:
Oh, that's his knife alright. Bought it for him for his birthday.
Apollo:
(Wow, that's a pretty hardcore present.)
Plum:
I remember him falling asleep with it clutched in his arms.
Trucy:
Ooh! I know the feeling! I'll bet he was just as happy as I was with my plastic spaghetti!
Pistol
Apollo:
So this pistol belongs to the Kitaki Family... Is that correct?
Plum:
It's one of the pieces we keep around. That is, we used to keep around. They're all gone now.
Apollo:
Oh?
Plum:
Police came yesterday and took everything. ...Everything but my "broom".
Trucy:
Don't you think you should have given them that, too?
Plum:
You kidding? Can't clean up very well without a broom!
June 16
Eldoon's House
Trucy:
Hey, it's Mr. Eldoon! Oh Mr. Eldooooon!
Guy:
...Hrmph.
Trucy:
What's wrong?
Guy:
...So, you found my stand. That's why I'm here. To thank you.
Trucy:
Ah.
Guy:
But now it's a crime scene and they won't let me have it back!!! That's also why I'm here. I got no other place to go.
Apollo:
Ah... I see.
Guy:
How can a noodle stand be a crime scene, that's what I don't get, Trucy-doll! Even in death he's after my neck, I tell ya! Bah! Can't even cook an honest noodle...
Apollo:
"He"...?
Trucy:
"Even in death"... You mean the victim, Dr. Meraktis?
Guy:
I tell ya. It's enough to drive a man to make his soup even saltier.
Apollo:
(Remind me never to eat his noodles when he's in a bad mood...)
Talk
The noodle stand
Guy:
That stand... For generations, it's served up the very best noodles us Eldoons could make. A tradition of noodles and salty broth. It's more than a stand, it's history, I tell you.
Apollo:
(Watch what you say or it might become true...)
Trucy:
That's a great story, Mr. Eldoon! A single stand, passed down from generation to generation!
Guy:
'Course, to be honest... I didn't plan on doing it.
Trucy:
That's right. You said something about that. About you "rebelling" against your pops, was it?
Guy:
Good memory, Trucy-doll. Aye, I was a go-getter back in my day... Until my friend next door butted in. In the end, I was left with nothing but this dusty old stand to earn my fortune.
Apollo:
Mr. Eldoon, I don't mean to pry... ...but what exactly did you do before you became a chef?
Guy:
Bah! Let old noodles lie, that's what I say.
Apollo:
(I'm starting to get an idea of what he did, anyway.)
Guy:
He stole my dreams and left me with nothin' but noodles. And now I don't even have that!
Meraktis Clinic
Apollo:
Mr. Eldoon, if I might ask... What exactly happened between you and the Meraktis Clinic?
Guy:
Eh? Eh!?
Apollo:
I couldn't help but sense enmity there...
Guy:
Enmity? I hate 'im! Er. Hated. Him actin' like he smells like roses when he's rollin' in mud!
Apollo:
Excuse me?
Guy:
He's the only doctor at that clinic, you know. Pretty impressive, eh? I'll tell you the secret to his success... The mob!
Apollo:
You mean... the Kitaki Family?
Guy:
They're always having one of them "turf wars" or whatnot. Always an injury or two that needs fixing. Meraktis saw a chance for some business. So he started giving the Kitaki Family a good deal...
Apollo:
A deal...?
Guy:
Every fifth operation for free! He stole the idea from my pops! One free bowl of noodles a week, he used to say.
Trucy:
Can a doctor just decide to do that? What about the insurance companies...?
Guy:
Oh, no doubt it's illegal. But, it got him in good with the Family. Pretty soon he was getting all the business in town. Leavin' me here, in the dark! Up t'my neck in soupy noodles!
Apollo:
(I think I've figured out Mr. Eldoon's former occupation...)
Trucy:
Can't hurt to ask, Apollo!
Eldoon's past (appears after "The noodle stand" and "Meraktis Clinic")
Apollo:
Mr. Eldoon... or should I say "Dr. Eldoon"...
Guy:
Figured it out, did ya? That's right, I was a doctor. A surgeon... until the year before last.
Trucy:
So Mr. Meraktis was your rival?
Guy:
...You like those onions they put in the soup broth?
Apollo:
Um, yeah, kind of.
Guy:
You take a spoon, you drink some broth... Those onions will find their way in there. For people who like 'em, why that's just fine. For people who hate 'em... ...I hate onions. Hate 'em! Always sneaking in from the side, gettin' in the way of a good tastin' spoonful. Well, that's what he was. An onion! Onion-boy, that's what I called 'im.
Apollo:
So... you weren't exactly friends.
Guy:
Hah! Me 'n Pal Meraktis... Ever since pre-school we were getting in each other's face. No matter what I did, sure enough, he'd come followin' along. Then he'd do it better than me. Just blow right past without so much as a "howdy".
Apollo:
...I see.
Guy:
That's right! I was a surgeon long before he was, you know. Then that no-good onion-boy comes along...
Apollo:
Well, Trucy, looks like we found ourselves a new suspect.
Trucy:
Don't say that!
Guy:
Thanks to him, I was forced to trade in my scalpel for a ladle! ...Sorry, pal. Didn't mean to weigh you down with an old man's ramblings.
Apollo:
No, it's fine.
Guy:
By way of apology... You ever get yourself in a spot of trouble, you drop by.
Apollo:
Huh?
Guy:
You're investigating Meraktis, aren't ya?
Apollo:
Yes...?
Guy:
Well, you want to know about a doctor, you ask a doctor. That's all I'm sayin'. You just think of me if you need something, Trucy-doll.
Trucy:
Right! Thanks, Mr. Eldoon!
Apollo:
(Hmm. I guess the time spent listening to him complain wasn't entirely wasted.)
Present
Noodle Stand
Guy:
That's right, sonny! When're you bringing my stand home!? I'm ready. Can't you see I'm ready!?
Apollo:
(I guess...)
Guy:
Until that stand is back home, the case is not closed! You hear me!?
Apollo:
(I think I'll avoid talking about his stand in the future.)
After switching to right side view:
Trucy:
Well, we've got to check out this clinic, that's for sure.
Apollo:
Yeah, but what about the guard?
Trucy:
No harm in asking! Um, excuse me!
Officer:
Hey, it's you two from yesterday!
Apollo:
(That's the same officer that was standing out by the park yesterday!)
Officer:
Your business is over in the park, isn't it? The clinic's off limits. It's not involved.
Trucy:
B-But...!
Officer:
What part of "off limits" do you not understand? Show me proof that the clinic is connected to the incident in the park, or beat it.
Apollo:
(No harm in asking... No gain either. No point in sticking around here, I guess.)
June 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Apollo:
Um... I was hoping to meet with my client?
Guard:
Wocky Kitaki's just finished questioning. I'll bring him out.
Trucy:
Great! Finally!
Wocky:
Yo, 'sup, my little imposter!
Trucy:
Eeek! Wh-What did you call me?
Wocky:
Dizzam! It's you!? Sorry, G, thought you were Alita.
Trucy:
"My little imposter" sure is a strange nickname.
Wocky:
It's a clink thang. You wouldn't understand. D-Did I say "imposter"? I meant "poster"... like "poster girl", 'aight?
Trucy:
If you're going to drop part of that, why not drop "poster" and just call her "girl"?
Wocky:
Cause she's so much more than that, G. She's like... She's like an angel. A fallen angel. ...So. What can I do you for?
Trucy:
...You don't look so chipper today, Wocky.
Apollo:
Worried about your, um, heart condition, maybe?
Wocky:
That was the wackest thing of all! All us G's lining up, taking eye exams... Better to die young than fade away, bizzzoy!
Klavier:
...A relief to hear.
Wocky:
Eh? Wh-What's a relief!?
Klavier:
Oh? Did your father not tell you? That bullet you carry so close to your heart... if not attended to immediately... ...It could kill you.
Wocky:
M-Man... I ain't trying to hear that! A man fights to protect what's valuable to him, you know what I'm saying? ...I miss my fallen angel! Hey, you go get Alita for me. You're my lawyer, aren't you?
Apollo:
(Lawyer, not gopher...)
Talk
Your fiancée
Apollo:
So, I hear you're to be married next month?
Wocky:
Straight up! We poured the nuptial 40 out on the stoop! Alita! Oh, snapplecakes! She soooo foine!
Apollo:
(I think he's smitten with her in his own weird way.)
Trucy:
I was wondering, how did you two meet? I asked Tiala, but she  was... very vague.
Wocky:
Huh? Well, man, if she wouldn't tell you... I'd best hold my tongue, you feel me?
Trucy:
Wha--!?
Wocky:
Man, what's past is past. She knows that. When I'm with Alita... I feel like there's things worth protecting out there. You feel me? And my Alita, she's down with that all the way.
Apollo:
(Hmm, so both of them are mum about their past...)
Meraktis Clinic
Trucy:
Do you think you could tell us what happened with you and Pal Meraktis...?
Wocky:
...There's something you should know. We Kitakis are having what you might call a feud with the Rivales Family. So, 'bout six months back... I go into Rivales turf, packing a knife, right?
Trucy:
And... You were shot?
Wocky:
Coldest thing I ever seen. One shot, to the heart, but my homies weren't too late. It's a miracle that I lived. It's already considered one of the seven wonders of the Kitaki Family, you know that?
Apollo:
So, you were taken to the Meraktis Clinic then?
Wocky:
You shoulda seen their faces when they wheeled me in. You can't just let the Boss's son die, you know?
Apollo:
(I'd hate to have been in that doctor's shoes... Mr. Kitaki's scary enough when he's not angry...)
Trucy:
But the bullet that hit you... ...it was never removed?
Apollo:
(And it's still threatening his life!)
Wocky:
That doctor... He did it on purpose! The Rivales paid him off, I'm sure of it!
Apollo:
(I need to hear more about the night of the murder, that much is clear.)
Wocky's future (appears after "Your fiancée")
Wocky:
Life in the Family is a G thang. It's about being a man. ...You know what I'm saying?
Trucy:
Sorry, I'm not up on my G things. I'm not even sure what a G thing is...
Wocky:
But my old man, he's gone soft. He says the old rival gang days are over. He just wants to make money!
Trucy:
Isn't that a good thing?
Wocky:
Man, there ain't no soul in making money! Better to live fast and die young. Fo'shizzle!
Apollo:
(*sigh*...)
Wocky:
Wait till I run the yard. Then everyone'll know what time it is. That's right! O.G. time all the time. Represent!
Trucy:
Apollo, why does he keep talking about "Old Guys"?
Apollo:
I don't think that's what "O.G." means, Trucy.
The night of the crime (appears after presenting Knife or Pistol after Meraktis Clinic)
Apollo:
Um... Actually, there's a question I've been wanting to ask you for a while now. That is, uh... Did you do it? Did you shoot him?
Wocky:
... I dunno.
Apollo:
Eh?
Wocky:
The day of that check-up, when I found out about the bullet by my heart... ...I... borrowed a gun from the Family's stash. Figured I'd give that doctor a taste of his own bad medicine.
Apollo:
(Uh oh... I don't like where this is going...)
Trucy:
But... you were carrying a knife, weren't you?
Wocky:
Oh that? Yeah, well, never can be too careful, I say. So I'm on my way to the clinic, right? When I run into him in the park... and he's dragging this noodle stand behind him!
Trucy:
Wait, you didn't put him up to that? Like, you know, in the movies? "If you value your life, you'll bring the stand..."
Wocky:
...Shorty, you're more wacked than I am. And that's saying something.
Trucy:
...But I was serious!
Wocky:
The thing is, I don't remember what happened next all too well.
Apollo:
You don't remember...?
Wocky:
But, the way I see it, if there wasn't anyone else there that night... ...then I guess it probably was me who did him in, you know what I'm saying?
Present
Knife or Pistol (after Meraktis Clinic)
Apollo:
About these weapons... the pistol and the knife.
Wocky:
They belong to the Family. I snuck 'em out that night.
Apollo:
So, the "killer" Mr. Stickler says he saw that night was...
Wocky:
I guess it was me. I was there, after all.
Apollo:
Gak...! (We're finished...)
Trucy:
Um... Yo, Wocky! Do you think you could tell us exactly what happened that night?
Wocky:
Heh... You don't beat around the bush, do you? I like your style, shorty.
Anything else
Wocky:
... Yeah, whatever.
Apollo:
(He seems preoccupied... I'm not sure he even looked at my evidence...)
Wocky:
Alita, man. Alita.
June 16
Kitaki Mansion
Trucy:
...Look at that crowd over by the park!
Apollo:
Probably people trying to get a glimpse of the crime scene.
Trucy:
But... why are those girls screaming? I think I just heard one say "Omigod, it's him!"
Apollo:
(Wait, that motorcycle...)
Klavier:
Ah! If it isn't Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
...Prosecutor Gavin.
Klavier:
Some fans found me on my way out... Just my luck.
???:
Omigod! Omigod! He's so cool!
Apollo:
Thus the screams...
Klavier:
New album just came out, you know. Try waving to them. They love it.
???:
Oooh! Oooh! He's so cute!
Klavier:
Ah ha ha. They're so excited, it doesn't matter who waves to them, see?
Apollo:
(This is surreal...)
Trucy:
Um, so you were here investigating?
Klavier:
And I was on my way home... when my hog gave up the ghost.
Apollo:
Your hog...?
Klavier:
My motorcycle won't start. A clogged exhaust pipe...
Trucy:
Too bad! It looks like such a nice bike, too. Hard to believe that it could break just from that!
Klavier:
Ach, it's my fault. I think I was using the wrong oil. Cars, motorbikes, they're all the same. Clog the exhaust, and they won't run. Ah, machines. Tell me you share my angst, Herr Forehead!
Apollo:
...I ride a bicycle, actually.
Klavier:
Ah. Heh. In any event, I'm off to the shop to get her fixed. The detective in charge of the scene isn't fond of me, in any case.
Apollo:
The detective... You mean, the one in the lab coat?
Klavier:
Ja. She's in a foul mood, too. Be gentle. ...Auf Wiedersehen, baby!
???:
Omigod! Omigod! There he goes!
Apollo:
And the forecast for the park today... Gloomy Skyes.
Trucy:
Well, nothing to do but head on in. Let's hit the park, Apollo!
June 16
People Park
Apollo:
Huh? Does something about this scene look different to you?
Trucy:
The blue tarps are gone! Maybe that's it?
Apollo:
Yeah, I think you're right. Look over there.
Trucy:
The white-frocked detective from yesterday. She seems to be apologizing reverently... to the trash can.
Apollo:
She's... under a lot of stress. The investigation's probably not going so well.
Ema:
Hey, you there! If you're going to talk about someone behind their back, do it more quietly, please!
Apollo:
Oh, Detective Skye. Hello.
Trucy:
You seem as gloomy as ever.
Ema:
This is miserable! Miserable! I just got a new kit, and I can't get the stuff to work. And everyone's all smiles for that glimmerous fop.
Trucy:
Glimmerous...? Does she mean Prosecutor Gavin?
Apollo:
More to the point, doesn't she mean "glamorous"?
Ema:
When he walks his shiny chains catch the sun and glimmer in my eyes! It's distracting. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH
Apollo:
(Speaking of distracting...)
Ema:
*sigh* I guess I just have to accept the fact that I lack talent.
Apollo:
(Sounds like she's trying out some sort of new forensics technique...)
Examine
Ground
Apollo:
The tarps that were here yesterday are gone.
Trucy:
I wonder why Detective Skye put them out?
Apollo:
Yeah... The only thing they were covering is the ground.
Trucy:
Oh! You know, I think I see something there... a print!
Apollo:
A... "print"?
Talk
Detective Skye
Apollo:
Detective Skye, you know Mr. Wright, correct?
Trucy:
How do you know my daddy!? I want details!
Ema:
Ah? Ah... Well... ...He helped me out a long time ago. You might say he "saved" me.
Apollo:
(Wasn't she saying something about "getting involved in an incident"?)
Ema:
I can't stand it when things are vague... especially in a case. I went to study to become a forensic scientist... in Europe.
Apollo:
But... you're a detective now?
Ema:
Well... I failed the test. But, you know, rank and title don't matter! What matters is what's inside your heart!
Trucy:
I've always thought that, too!
Ema:
And my heart is full of science! That's why I bought this kit through mail order. And I'm going to test it here before the forensics team arrives!
Apollo:
(Are you sure that's OK...?)
Prosecutor Gavin
Ema:
I won't lie, I'm not fond of the man. Those glimmerous types always rub me the wrong way.
Apollo:
"Glamorous"... right.
Ema:
A prosecutor should be cool of wit and furrowed of brow. Less "glimmerous" and more "simmerous"... you know?
Apollo:
...No, actually, I don't.
Ema:
Well, that, and what happened seven years ago! Prosecutor Gavin was the one who stripped Mr. Wright of his attorney's badge!
Apollo:
Whaaaaaa--!? Really!? (He was the one!?)
Ema:
...You mean you didn't know? I thought you were one of his boys!
Apollo:
(I'm neither a "boy" nor one of his... but let's see what she has to say.) Um... What exactly happened seven years ago? I never actually heard the details.
Ema:
...Then investigate. It's better you learned it for yourself, anyway.
Trucy:
...
The new kit?
Apollo:
...Do you mind me asking exactly what it is you've been doing... ...squatting down on the ground like that?
Ema:
Ooh! You want to know? Do you? Well, I splurged on a new toy!
Apollo:
(You splurged... You mean, it wasn't police issue?)
Trucy:
What is it? I see a roller... and glue?
Ema:
This is a footprint analysis kit!
Apollo:
Footprint...?
Ema:
It was raining on the night of the murder, which means that footprints were left!
Trucy:
Oh, does that have anything to do with those blue tarps?
Ema:
Right. The ground was muddy, so I had to protect it as it was that night. Ever wanted to know exactly where someone was standing? Like your panty-snatching student witness, for instance?
Trucy:
Ah ha! So with that kit...!
Ema:
Right!
Apollo:
...What?
Ema:
Want to try this stuff out?
Apollo:
Huh? Are you sure? I mean, we're sort of on opposing teams and all...
Ema:
Oh, pshaw! You're friends! And... to tell the truth, I'm not so good at doing this. Guess I'm a little clumsy. I could use your help.
Trucy:
Ooh! I'm good at stuff like this! I used to make magic bunnies out of paper mache!
Apollo:
(Footprint analysis, huh? Well, should I give it a go?)
Try it
Leads to:
"OK... I'll give it a go!"
No need
Apollo:
I think I'll pass. Wouldn't want to waste a kit if I  messed up.
Ema:
Really? That's too bad... I really could use the help.
Trucy:
Aww, I want to try! It'll be just like making pancakes in the dirt!
Apollo:
(I guess I can always talk to her again if I change my mind...)
Apollo:
OK... I'll give it a go!
Ema:
That's the spirit! Right, allow me to explain! Ahem, one moment...
Trucy:
She's reading the instructions for her kit...
Apollo:
(Why does this not fill me with confidence?)
Ema:
First, we have to pick the footprint, or in this case, shoe print we want to analyze! I've taken the liberty of marking all the shoe prints in the park. Well, which shoe print should we start with...? If we're going to verify the defendant's account, here's the place to start! Shoe prints, prepare to be examined!
Trucy:
Ooh! This is so exciting!
Ema:
Right, here goes! First... "Pour the plaster into the print until it's full." ...You try it.
Apollo:
How am I supposed to do that!?
Ema:
Just touch the screen where you want to pour the plaster. Like this!
Apollo:
(Hmm, that doesn't look too hard...)
Ema:
If you run out of plaster in your beaker before you're done, you have to start over!
Fill shoe print with plaster
Leads to:
"Not bad. You're handier with that than you look."
Fail to fill shoe print with plaster
Ema:
What are you doing!? Out of plaster already?
Apollo:
Hey, give me a break! I'm just a beginner at this!
Ema:
I'm not that far ahead of you believe me! ...Fine. I'll make another batch. Don't mess it up this time.
Apollo:
(Plaster, here comes Justice! *sigh*)
Leads back to filling shoe with plaster
Ema:
Not bad. You're handier with that than you look.
Apollo:
(What's that supposed to mean?)
Ema:
On to the next step! Um... "Dry the plaster until it turns white." Right! Just touch to direct the dryer! ...There, give it a shot!
Dry
Leads to:
"Looks like it's hardened nicely."
Ema:
Looks like it's hardened nicely. Let's take a look! Hmm... Yes, that's a good one. Next, the ink! Ready for the next step? Use the roller to ink just the shoe print part. Hold on to that roller tight now, and roll it up and down. Keep going till you get enough ink on there for a good print!
Roll up and down
Leads to:
"Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for!"
Ema:
Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for! Let's take our print! Ready? Here goes! Let's see if we get a match.
Compare Wocky Kitaki
Comparing...
Comparison complete.
Match found
Leads to:
"So the shoe prints belong to Wocky Kitaki after all..."
Compare anyone else
Comparing...
Comparison complete.
No Match found
Ema:
Hmm, no good. Must have messed up somewhere. Shall we try on another print?
Leads back to profile selection
Apollo:
So the shoe prints belong to Wocky Kitaki after all...
Ema:
He was in the park on the night of the crime!
Trucy:
Wow! I can almost see the science at work!
Ema:
Don't you love it!? Ahhh! Nothing feels better.
Apollo:
(She's definitely waaaay more into this than I am...)
Ema:
Just let me know if you want to do some more. I'll be here, solving the case... with science!
Apollo:
(Well, that certainly brightened her mood.)
The new kit? (subsequent times)
Ema:
Hmm? Still interested in the bleeding edge of forensic science? Why didn't you say so in the first place!?
Footprint analysis (appears after "The new kit?")
Apollo:
Detective Skye? Mind if we give it another go?
Ema:
Right on! Leave no print un-analyzed, I say! ...Now to pick which print you want to analyze!
Analyze green prints
Fill shoe print with plaster
Leads to:
"...OK! Looking good."
Ema:
...OK! Looking good. Next, to dry the plaster!
Dry
Leads to:
"OK, let's take out the mold!"
Ema:
OK, let's take out the mold! Hmm... Yes, that's a good one. Next, the ink!
Roll up and down
Leads to:
"Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for! Let's take our print!"
Ema:
Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for! Let's take our print! Ready? Here goes! Let's see if we get a match.
Compare Wesley Stickler

No Match found
Ema:
Hmm, no good. Must have messed up somewhere. Shall we try on another print?
Leads back to profile selection
Apollo:
So these shoe prints belong to Wesley Stickler. This confirms his testimony. The final version of it, at least.
Ema:
Now we know where the panty-snatcher was standing!
Analyze red print
Fill shoe print with plaster
Leads to:
"...OK! Looking good."
Ema:
...OK! Looking good. Next, to dry the plaster!
Dry
Leads to:
"OK, let's take out the mold!"

Roll up and down
Leads to:
"...Huh. That's a funny shoe print. Is that even a shoe?"
Trucy:
...Huh. That's a funny shoe print. Is that even a shoe?
Ema:
It is strange. So smooth...
Apollo:
Except for the part with the leaf.
Ema:
I can say without even looking that this print doesn't match any print on our list.
Apollo:
(Hmm... A mystery print.)
Back
Ema:
Huh? Giving up already? Suit yourself. If you want to take another swing at it, just let me know.
Another shoe print (appears after examining red print)
Apollo:
Detective Skye? Mind if we give it another shot?
Ema:
I believe you're beginning to appreciate the wonder that is forensic science!
Leads to footprint selection
Another shoe print (subsequent times)
Apollo:
Detective Skye? Mind if we give it another shot?
Ema:
I wish there were more prints to analyze... *sniffle* I know! Quick! Step in that mud over there!
Apollo:
Uh, I don't think analyzing my footprint is going to do us much good.
Ema:
*sigh* I would have had fun.
Leads to footprint selection
Mystery print (appears after "Another shoe print")
Ema:
This print is far too smooth to be from a regular shoe.
Trucy:
It is a shoe print of some kind though, that's certain.
Ema:
Still, you have to wonder what it's doing here.
Trucy:
It's right next to the Eldoon's Noodles stand!
Ema:
It does make one wonder... ...Hey, you.
Apollo:
...Yes?
Ema:
Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? ...You wouldn't happen to have something in mind? Something that might have left this mystery shoe print?
Apollo:
(This mystery shoe print does remind me of something...)
Show evidence
Leads to:
"I'm pretty sure I've seen something that would leave a print like that."
No need
Apollo:
Hmm... No, sorry. No idea.
Ema:
Too bad. I wonder what it is.
Trucy:
Something's familiar about that smooth surface... so smooth it's almost slippery.
Ema:
...Well, if you think of something, I'm all ears.
Apollo:
(I'm pretty sure I've seen something that would leave a print like that.) You know, I think I have our culprit right here...
Present Slippers after examining bottom
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Well, I think it's these slippers, actually."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Ema:
... Know what I'm eating?
Apollo:
Um... Snacks?
Ema:
Snacks. More precisely, whenever I'm in a bad mood, I eat chocolate Snackoos.
Apollo:
...I had no idea.
Trucy:
I think she means you picked the wrong evidence, Apollo.
Apollo:
(...I had no idea.)
Apollo:
Well, I think it's these slippers, actually.
Ema:
Slippers... What would slippers be doing out here?
Apollo:
But look at the bottom! See?
Ema:
It's covered with paint! Except for...
Apollo:
See, right here?
Ema:
Hey, that spot is shaped like a leaf!
Apollo:
What if a leaf was stuck on the bottom, and came off when the slipper stepped in paint? ...Makes sense, doesn't it?
Ema:
Wait, something's written on them... ..."The Meraktis Clinic"!
Apollo:
Exactly! The victim's clinic!
Trucy:
Wait, that means... ...that someone from the clinic was involved?
Ema:
...
Apollo:
(Why is she just standing there eating?)
Trucy:
Um, Detective Skye? I have a favor to ask!
Ema:
Wh-What?
Apollo:
Can you get us access into the Meraktis Clinic?
Trucy:
The police won't let us in! They say the murder and the clinic are not connected. And it's off limits until we prove they are!
Ema:
... I should be able to do something for you, yes.
Apollo:
Eh? Really?
Ema:
Well, you did my work for me here with the shoe prints. Seems like I should return the favor.
Trucy:
Thank you, Detective Skye!
Ema:
Here, show this to the police officer on duty.
Detective Skye's Orders added to the Court Record.
Apollo:
(Right! Meraktis Clinic, here comes Justice!)
Present
Fingerprint Powder
Ema:
Fingerprint analysis is the very basis of modern forensic science!
Apollo:
...I guess you could put it that way.
Ema:
And you two know how to dust for prints on your own now! Make sure to examine anything you find that might have prints on it!
Slippers
Ema:
They say "The Meraktis Clinic"... Hey!
Apollo:
Wh-What?
Ema:
This slipper... Look right here! I think I see a toe mark!
Apollo:
A toe mark... You think we can get a print off that!?
Ema:
Sure! Toes have prints just like fingers do, you know.
Apollo:
(This little clue might be a gold mine!)
Ema:
Oh... There's one problem. The police station doesn't keep a record of toe prints. So we won't know whose it is.
Apollo:
(...I guess that would be too much to hope for.)
Trucy:
Still, it might be useful somehow! Let's analyze it!
Examine evidence
Detective Skye's Orders
Signature on back
Trucy:
She put a little heart by her name! How cute!
Apollo:
Isn't she a little old for cute?
Trucy:
Apollo! Shame on you! Cute is eternal! Cute is timeless! No matter how old a woman gets she always carries a little innocent maiden inside her!
Apollo:
...R-Really now. I suppose. I've never heard it put quite that way before.
Trucy:
When I sign my name, I always put in a little diamond! "Trucy ◇ Wright"... See? Cute, don'tcha think?
Apollo:
It's a little confusing. Won't people think your middle name is diamond?
Trucy:
Hey! You could write your name like "Apollo {{{2}}} Justice"!
Apollo:
I do like justice, but that's taking it a bit far.
June 16
Hickfield Clinic
Phoenix:
Ah, the prodigal attorney returns! Welcome, Apollo. I heard you did well in the trial today. Here to discuss something? I could use a little diversion...
Apollo:
(What did Detective Skye say? If you want to know something, you have to investigate it yourself...) Mr. Wright! Tell me what happened seven years ago... please. I want to know. I need to know!
Phoenix:
You certainly didn't waste any time getting to the point.
Talk
7 years ago
Phoenix:
Seven years ago, I was standing in a courtroom... on behalf of a client. The case involved the death of a certain "magnificent" genius... I'd be surprised if you hadn't heard about it.
Apollo:
...It was all over the news, I remember that. You were up against Prosecutor Gavin, weren't you?
Phoenix:
...Yes, he was only 17 years old at the time.
Apollo:
(17 years old...? That's still high school!)
Phoenix:
He took the bar exam abroad... in Europe. They're progressive over there, you know. I was defeated by a 17-year-old newcomer. In my shame, I left the practice forever. That's all.
Apollo:
That's all...? How could that be all!?
Phoenix:
...What do you mean?
Apollo:
What about what they were saying on the news about forged evidence!?
Phoenix:
...
Apollo:
They said you forged evidence and had your attorney's badge stripped from you!
Phoenix:
...
Forged evidence (appears after "7 years ago")
Phoenix:
Tell me... how does it feel? How does it feel to stand here before Phoenix Wright, the Forgin' Attorney himself?
Apollo:
H-How does it feel...? (I... I don't want to believe it's true! But what about what happened in my first trial...)
Phoenix:
Didn't you notice in today's trial? There was a single piece of forged evidence. I'm talking about evidence that shouldn't have existed. A naughty magician's trick...
Phoenix:
Ah ha ha ha ha! I don't see you jumping to my defense on this one... Maybe I did forge evidence, maybe I didn't. ...It doesn't really matter now, does it?
Apollo:
B-But...!
Phoenix:
I'm not an attorney anymore. ...That's the only truth you need to know.
Apollo:
(Mr. Wright... Looks like he doesn't want to talk about the accusations of forgery... for now.)
Present
Mirror
Phoenix:
Ah, so that was what led you to the guilty party.
Apollo:
Yes! Thanks to you ripping the mirror off the car, I was able to deduce the...
Phoenix:
You make a good point, Apollo. In fact... It could be said that I'm to thank for finding the criminal.
Apollo:
(...Think what you want, Mr. Wright. Knock yourself out.)
Trucy's Panties
Apollo:
And we found these, too! They're Trucy's.
Phoenix:
Thanks, Apollo. Though, I have to admit, as a father, I wonder... ...why are you still carrying my daughter's panties around in your pocket?
Apollo:
(Ack! That'll teach me to show off my evidence to Mr. Wright...)
June 15
Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Trucy:
Well, the time of the decision is upon us! Which one of our two jailbirds do we want to talk to?
Guard:
Excuse me! Both detainees are currently in questioning to corroborate their accounts.
Apollo:
Mr. Stickler and Wocky? Both of them? (I pity the questioner...)
Trucy:
I guess we'll be back then!
June 16
Eldoon's House
Officer:
Ah, you two again. When, oh when will you learn. Look at me however you want, you're not getting in today.
Trucy:
I wouldn't be so sure if I  were you! Look what we have!
Officer:
What's this? ...Detective Skye! ... Yesterday, it was Prosecutor Gavin, today it's Detective Skye. Who are you two? Really.
Apollo:
(Now he's suspicious again...)
Officer:
...Well, you got the orders, I gotta let you in. Have fun.
Trucy:
Thanks, Mr. Officer! Let's hit it, Apollo!
June 16
Meraktis ClinicReception
Trucy:
Huh, kind of an at-home sort of place, isn't it?
Apollo:
This place has a connection to the murder in the park... I'm sure of it!
Trucy:
The police guy out front wasn't so sure.
Apollo:
Beyond it being where the victim lived. (Looks like the police team's gone home for the day.)
Trucy:
There might be some clues lying around! Let's get cracking, Apollo!
Examine
Bowls
Trucy:
Look at all these bowls...
Apollo:
They're from Eldoon's Noodles! There's Mr. Salty!
Trucy:
Then, I think we've figured something out.
Apollo:
I think we have.
Trucy:
Mr. Eldoon must do take-out!
Apollo:
... (Not exactly what I was thinking.)
Trucy:
All the bowls have been washed clean...!
Apollo:
I think we've found our first clue, Trucy.
Office door
Leads to:
"Look! This door says "Doctor's Office"!"
Office door (subsequent times)
Apollo:
A plate on this door reads "Doctor's Office".
Trucy:
That was pretty intense, wasn't it!?
Apollo:
If we'd gone in there one second earlier, we might have met the burglar!
Trucy:
But, Apollo... What would we have said if we did see them? We can't exactly shout out "Hey! Who are you!?"
Apollo:
... It does lack a certain punch.
Trucy:
Let's think of something cool to say for the next time we do meet a burglar!
Reception desk
Apollo:
The clinic's reception desk. No one's here, of course. There's a small sign on the counter... "Please pay your bill: Remember, we're the ones holding the scalpel." Brutal... but effective.
Sandals
Trucy:
There's a single pair of sandals here.
Apollo:
Wait, but why would there be sandals here? Unless they belong to one of the patients.
Trucy:
Or maybe it's a visitor that's come to see Dr. Meraktis.
Apollo:
You'd think they'd use his house entrance instead of the clinic entrance, in that case. And, if this patient or visitor isn't still here...
Trucy:
Why'd they leave without their shoes?
Apollo:
(Better take a closer look at these, just in case.)
Sandals added to the Court Record.
Sandals (subsequent times)
Apollo:
A pair of sandals in a deserted clinic...
Trucy:
It's a little scary... when you stop to think about it. And how did the lady go home without her sandals?
Apollo:
Hmm... Maybe her operation here was to add wings, and she flew home?
Trucy:
Oh, I've heard of those! Surgical enhancements, right?
Apollo:
(Surgical enhancements are for a different part of the body, and, I was kidding...)
Slipper rack
Trucy:
These must be the slippers for patients at the clinic.
Apollo:
The same as the pair we found, of course.
Trucy:
Look, a single pair is missing from the rack here, too. And ours have paint on the bottoms... Which means they were taken out of here on the night of the murder.
Apollo:
Right... The paint's from the hit and run, after all. (But what were a pair of clinic slippers doing in that trash can? And what were they doing at the scene of the hit and run?)
Examine evidence
Sandals
Toe print
Trucy:
Hey, Apollo! You think this is...?
Apollo:
Huh... This could be a toe print.
Trucy:
Maybe we can get a print off of this! Let's try it out!
Obtain toe print
Leads to:
"Hey! It worked! That looks like... a big toe, maybe?"
Apollo:
Hey! It worked! That looks like... a big toe, maybe?
Trucy:
But wait! I mean, it's great that we got the print... But is there such a thing as a list of toe prints?
Apollo:
Oh, good point. If there is, Detective Skye didn't give it to us. Which means... we can't match this print.
Trucy:
This seems like a good time to ask a detective's advice.
Apollo:
Yeah, good idea.
Toe print (subsequent times)
Apollo:
So, we have a toe print now.
Trucy:
I'm not sure what good it's going to do us without a list of toe prints to check it on.
Apollo:
(Maybe our detective friend can help us...)
Trucy:
Look! This door says "Doctor's Office"!
Apollo:
Think this is the victim's private office?
Trucy:
It's not locked... Too bad.
Apollo:
Why "too bad"?
Trucy:
I like opening locks! It's kind of a hobby of mine. Like those little bike locks? Don't even bother putting them on when I'm around!
Apollo:
...That's probably not a hobby you want to tell too many people about.
*thump*
Trucy:
......! Ah... Apollo! That sound... It came from behind this door!
Apollo:
(...Someone's in there!) L-Let's check it out, Trucy!
Meraktis Clinic - Office
Apollo:
A break-in! They left through that window!
Trucy:
Wait, Apollo! You're too late to catch them now!
Apollo:
(That must be her experience as a panty-snatcher chaser talking.) Well, we should tell the police!
Trucy:
Let's check the room out, first, Apollo! If we call the police now, we'll lose our chance!
Apollo:
Y-You're right. (She's better at this than I am!)
Trucy:
Well, one thing's for certain. This clinic and our murder case are looking pretty related now!
Examine
Blue jars
Apollo:
Whoa! What are those? The wall is covered with beakers...
Trucy:
Eeeeek! Something's moving inside that one! ...You look, Apollo!
Apollo:
H-Hey, look yourself! You can't... Oh. ...It's a goldfish.
Trucy:
Wow, they're all fish! So many kinds!
Apollo:
(Whoever designed this had a sick sense of humor...)
Lamp
Trucy:
Kind of an expensive-looking lamp, isn't it? Hey... The bulb's broken.
Apollo:
Broken? Don't you mean burned-out?
Trucy:
No. Our cat burglar must have dropped it.
Apollo:
But why is it standing up on the floor like that then?
Trucy:
Hey, look at the cord...
Apollo:
(Huh? There's a red splotch on a part of the cord...) You think that's... blood?
Trucy:
It's a little bright for blood. Almost pinkish.
Apollo:
Something's definitely odd about this lamp, that's for sure.
Lamp added to the Court Record.
Lamp (subsequent times)
Apollo:
Kind of an expensive-looking lamp. The bulb's broken. (And here I thought light bulbs were usually pretty resilient little buggers.)
Trucy:
Maybe the burglar dropped it.
Apollo:
Funny that it's standing upright on the floor then.
Trucy:
It's bit peculiar [sic], isn't it...?
Open window
Apollo:
The window is ajar.
Trucy:
That must be how our burglar escaped!
Apollo:
I wonder who it was?
Trucy:
Maybe it was just a burglar who happened to pick here?
Apollo:
Yeah, but there's a patrol car sitting out front. If I were a burglar, I'd come back the next day at least.
Trucy:
I'd give it a month, myself.
Apollo:
(Whoever broke in obviously needed to break in today.)
Papers and spilled cup
Apollo:
Books and papers are scattered around the room.
Trucy:
Wow, what a mess. This is worse than Daddy's room! The burglar must have left in a hurry.
Apollo:
Even the cup on the desk here is lying on its side. Huh? The juice that spilled out of that cup... It's dry.
Trucy:
So, the messy one wasn't our burglar just now!
Apollo:
Someone knocked this cup over a while ago and left it.
Potted plant
Apollo:
This potted plant has seen better days. Hmm... That doesn't make sense either.
Trucy:
What doesn't?
Apollo:
Normally, burglars are looking for valuables, right?
Trucy:
That's true! That's what I would do! If I were a burglar.
Apollo:
So why look under a potted plant?
Trucy:
Maybe they were looking for the key to the safe?
Apollo:
I've heard of people putting their house keys under plants, but the key to a safe...?
Trucy:
Then maybe the burglar was looking for the house keys!
Apollo:
(This is getting nowhere fast...)
Wall safe
Trucy:
What a cute little safe!
Apollo:
Hmm, looks like a four-digit lock.
Trucy:
...! Someone's already entered in two numbers, Apollo! 7...9... Wait, do you think...
Apollo:
...That burglar just now was trying to open it!? (I wonder what's inside this safe...?)
Trucy:
Hmm, is there any way we can figure out the last two numbers?
Apollo:
Well, we know the first two are 7 and 9...
Trucy:
Maybe there's something in the Court Record? Something that can help us figure out the last two numbers!
Apollo:
(Hmm, I wonder...)
I've got just the thing!
Leads to:
"Well, I have an idea..."
No such luck
Apollo:
That would be a bit too lucky, don't you think?
Trucy:
Well, I suppose... If only there was something that could finger which buttons had been pressed!
Apollo:
(Something that could "finger which buttons were pressed", huh? Maybe there is a way after all...)
Apollo:
Well, I have an idea...
Trucy:
I knew it, Apollo! What is it?
Apollo:
(Well... All we have to know is what buttons have been pressed!) We can use this to find out what the next two numbers are!
Present Fingerprint Powder
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...When you press the buttons, you'd have to touch them..."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Trucy:
... I'm not sure how that's going to help us.
Apollo:
(Neither am I, come to think of it...)
Trucy:
If only there was something that could finger which buttons had been pressed!
Apollo:
(Something that could "finger" which buttons were pressed", huh?)
Apollo:
...When you press the buttons, you'd have to touch them... ...with your finger, right?
Trucy:
It would leave a print!
Apollo:
When you open a safe, you don't press any other buttons but the right ones, right? So, if we can find the buttons with fingerprints...
Trucy:
We'll have the safe code! Not bad, Apollo!
Obtain fingerprints
Leads to:
"Look! You can see the oily finger residues clearly."
Apollo:
Look! You can see the oily finger residues clearly. Look at 7 and 9...
Trucy:
These are glove marks. The burglar must have been wearing gloves.
Apollo:
Well, we might not be able to identify the burglar, but we can open this safe! Let's give it a shot!
Input 7952
Code Confirmed
Leads to:
"...It opened!"
Examine safe (subsequent before opening)
Trucy:
Let's enter the code, Apollo! We know the first two numbers are 7 and 9!
Input any number else
Code Incorrect
Leads back into code input
Apollo:
...It opened!
Bullet hole (after opening wall safe)
Apollo:
This looks like a bullet hole!
Trucy:
Hmm, you can still see the bullet sticking out of it.
Apollo:
Why is it in the middle of a safe?
Trucy:
Hey, the bullet came out! The tip is all squished.
Apollo:
Not surprising given that it was fired into a metal safe. (This bullet's got a story behind it, that's for sure.)
Bullet added to the Court Record.
Bullet hole (subsequent times)
Apollo:
(A bullet hole remains in the back wall of the safe. Now why would someone shoot a bullet into a safe?)
Medical chart (after opening wall safe)
Trucy:
This looks like... a medical chart. There's an X-ray in here with it.
Apollo:
An X-ray...? Hmm, can't make heads or tails of it. And I can't read the chart either, it's all in medical-speak.
Trucy:
But, the names are easy enough to read. Look, by "Patient" it says... "Wocky Kitaki"! So this is Wocky... our client's chart, huh.
Apollo:
Why would this one chart be here in this safe...? Let's see, the physician's signature says "Pal Meraktis". Eh...
Trucy:
What is it, Apollo?
Apollo:
Look here where it says who filed the chart...
Trucy:
Let's see... "Nurse Alita Tiala"...!
Apollo:
Alita Tialita is Wocky's fiancée!
Trucy:
That's one "ita" too many, Apololo!
Apollo:
Never mind that, what's her name doing here!?
Trucy:
How should I know? Though... I guess it means she's on staff at this clinic?
Apollo:
Odd that she neglected to mention this before now...
Trucy:
I'm sure she had her reasons.
Apollo:
(So Alita Tiala worked at the Meraktis Clinic... And she had access to Wocki Kitaky's medical chart!)
Trucy:
You got the "I" and "Y" wrong, Appolo!
Apollo:
I'd be very interested to find out what this chart says. (Who could help us decipher this...?)
Wocky's Chart added to the Court Record.
Medical chart (subsequent times)
Apollo:
(Wocky's medical chart was hidden inside a safe... And Alita Tiala was the one who filed it.) We have to figure out what this chart says. (I wonder if there's anyone who can help us decipher it?)
Examine evidence
Lamp
Broken bulb
Apollo:
The bulb is broken. It won't turn on.
Trucy:
Oh? How is it broken...?
Apollo:
Don't touch that. You'll cut yourself.
Trucy:
Eeeek!
Apollo:
Yeah, yeah, fool me once, shame on me, fool my twice...
Trucy:
M-My finger!
Apollo:
Ack! Y-You're bleeding! Let me see that... ......Wait.
Trucy:
...Magic blood! Tee hee! Gotcha!
Apollo:
...Please don't do that again. I have enough to worry about without my co-workers injuring themselves on the evidence.
Red stain on cord
Apollo:
This cord runs to the lamp. It has a red stain on it. Hmm... Gotta wonder what left that stain.
Trucy:
Wait! I know! Maybe it was left there by a red marker! Like, they were trying to write their name, and slipped.
Apollo:
Why would anyone write their name on a lamp cord?
Trucy:
I used to write my name on my magic ropes...
Bullet
Head of Bullet
Trucy:
Wow! It's all mushed!
Apollo:
That was one tough safe.
Trucy:
You know, it looks kinda yummy.
Apollo:
...Huh?
Trucy:
...Like ice cream! Mmm-mmm! Caramel!
Apollo:
You certainly have an active imagination, Trucy.
People Park, after examining Sandal
Ema:
I know that face. That's the face of someone who's made... a discovery!
Trucy:
Hey, how did you know?
Ema:
You can't fool someone trained in the ways of science!
Apollo:
(Next she'll have us analyzing face prints...)
Trucy:
Let's ask Detective Skye to help us, Apollo!
Present
Lamp
Apollo:
Say, could you take a look at this lamp?
Ema:
Hmm. The bulb's broken.
Apollo:
Right. Strange, isn't it?
Ema:
Really? I break bulbs all the time. My desk is a mess and my lamp is always falling over. ...Not too bright, huh?
Apollo:
(Ouch...)
Trucy:
I still think it's kind of odd...
Wocky's Chart
Trucy:
Detective Skye, I was wondering about this...
Apollo:
Ack, Trucy! Wait!
Trucy:
What?
Apollo:
That's vital evidence there. You can't show her that! That's our secret weapon in tomorrow's trial for sure!
Trucy:
Ooh! Clever, Apollo!
Ema:
...What did I tell you before? If you're going to talk behind someone's back, do it quietly.
Bullet
Trucy:
Detective Skye, I was wondering about this...
Apollo:
Ack, Trucy! Wait!
Trucy:
What?
Apollo:
This bullet was inside the safe, right? That means the police don't know about it yet!
Trucy:
Oh, right! We can use this in the trial tomorrow!
Ema:
...Do I have to repeat myself every time? If you're going to talk behind someone's back, do so quietly!
Slippers (after obtain toe print)
Ema:
Ah, the slippers... That's quite a clear print there. ...A toe print.
Trucy:
Too bad we don't know whose toe it is.
Ema:
Well, there is a way of finding out, of course.
Apollo:
There is!? What?
Ema:
All you need is a sample of the same toe print, off another shoe, for instance.
Apollo:
Oh, right. So if the prints matched, you'd know the same person wore both. (Hmm. Do I have another shoe worn by the same person?)
Got one right here
Leads to:
"I think I just might, actually."
No such luck
Apollo:
No... I can't think of anything I might have with a toe print on it.
Ema:
Ah well, it was too much to hope for, I suppose. Let me know if you find something.
Apollo:
(A toe print sample... Hmm.)
Apollo:
I think I just might, actually.
Ema:
Really!?
Apollo:
(I'm beginning to suspect something here...) Detective Skye! Can you compare this sample with this other print?
Present Slippers
Apollo:
Take that!
Ema:
...
Apollo:
What's with the scowl?
Trucy:
It's got a toe print on it, doesn't it?
Ema:
...Of course it matches. It's the same evidence as before!
Apollo:
Huh? Oh, right.
Ema:
What are you thinking, trying to compare something with itself!?
Apollo:
(I'd better stop messing up or I'm gonna get struck down by lightning from the Skye.)
Ema:
Try again! And... try scientifically, please.
Apollo:
(Hmm, another toe print. Right!)
Present Sandals
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This pair of sandals, toe print and all."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Ema:
... I did say "toe print" sample, didn't I? Where exactly is the toe print on this evidence!?
Apollo:
(Oops. Stormy Skyes ahead...)
Ema:
Try again. Scientifically this time, if you would.
Apollo:
(Hmm, a toe print. Right!)
Apollo:
This pair of sandals, toe print and all.
Ema:
Ooh! The print on these is nice and clear, too. That makes our job easy.
Apollo:
Can you analyze it for us?
Ema:
Of course! Hang on...
Ema:
Bingo! Gosh, I'm good.
Apollo:
(Hey, we were the ones who found the prints...)
Ema:
A perfect match! The same person wore these sandals and slippers!
Apollo:
I was afraid of that...
Ema:
All you have to do is find out who these sandals belong to! Or... do you already know?
Apollo:
I... can't say. Not yet. (Well, that's one big step closer... ...to the truth!)
Sandals
Ema:
Hmm... Yes... Yes!
Apollo:
Did you find something?
Ema:
Well, scientifically speaking... These are a pair of woman's sandals. Pretty cute, too.
Trucy:
We found them in the lobby at the Meraktis Clinic!
Ema:
Hmm? Say, this sandal has a toe mark...
Apollo:
A toe mark... You mean a toe print?
Ema:
That I do! You can analyze it just like a fingerprint!
Apollo:
(This little clue might be a real windfall!)
Ema:
Oh... There's one problem. The police station doesn't keep a record of toe prints. So we won't know whose it is.
Apollo:
(...I guess that would be too much to hope for.)
Trucy:
Still, it might be useful somehow! Let's analyze it!
Sandals (after obtain toe print)
Ema:
These sandals... That's quite a clear print there. ...A toe print.

Slippers or Sandals (subsequent times)
Ema:
Well, if the prints on these slippers and these sandals match, which they do... ...it means that the same person was wearing them.
Trucy:
You know, I thought that's what it might mean! Science is amazing!
Ema:
It is, isn't it!? I've never felt so alive!
Apollo:
(I don't know about science, but this is a major lead!)
Examine evidence
Slippers
Toe print
Apollo:
The toe prints match... Which means the sandals and the slippers were worn by the same person. And the slippers are from the Meraktis Clinic. These have to be connected to the crime!
Sandals
Toe print
Apollo:
The toe prints match... Which means the sandals and the slippers were worn by the same person. If only we knew who these sandals belonged to...
June 16
Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Wocky:
Don't cry angel, Daddy's back and Daddy's... ...Oh. You again.
Apollo:
Do you always have to announce your entrances like that?
Wocky:
Man, my old man, he... Man! Now I'm all in a funk, and it's his fault.
Apollo:
(One can only assume that his father tried to teach him a lesson. And failed, clearly.)
Wocky:
You two got your work cut out for you, straight up. Course I don't care if they lock me up. I'm ready to go!
Apollo:
(Some days, I wonder why I do what I do.)
Talk
Guilty verdict
Wocky:
Hey man, you won't see me bugging 'bout one or two guilty charges.
Trucy:
But what if you're found guilty of murder!?
Wocky:
Hey, it's all experience, you feel me, shorty? Like a badge of honor. ...They don't give the death penalty, do they?
Trucy:
...You didn't really do it, did you?
Wocky:
... Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.
Apollo:
(If I've learned one thing today... it's that "silence" speaks louder than words.)
Your father
Wocky:
Man, my old man is wack. Disappointing, that's what he is.
Trucy:
I heard he wants to leave the mob?
Wocky:
Over my dead body! I spend my life, trying to keep it real, being an O.G. and never stepping down. Now my old man wants to go soft? Fine, let him. Just leave me out of it.
Apollo:
(*sigh*)
Wocky:
The day I get out of the clink... That's the day Alita and I start the next generation of the Kitaki Family.
Apollo:
(Please don't talk as though it's assumed you're going to jail... for my sake.)
Wocky &amp; Alita (appears after presenting Wocky's Chart)
Wocky:
'Bout half a year ago, I was shot during a little turf war with another family. I was ready to die, sure. But they came in and got me, hauled me off to the doc's.
Trucy:
...The Meraktis Clinic?
Wocky:
That's where I met her. My fallen angel...
Apollo:
You mean Alita Tiala?
Wocky:
She was scared of me at first, turns out. But you know what they say -- the bad guy always gets the ladies.
Apollo:
Right...
Wocky:
She was done with that clinic anyhow. So I was like, I'll take you on, woman! Straight gangster style. Guess what she said?
Trucy:
What did she say?
Wocky:
C'mon, give it some thought! She said it real quiet-like, on the down low, know what I'm saying? "I'll leave... if you'll marry me."
Apollo:
So... that was the proposal?
Wocky:
You know it! An oath of love, right there in the hospital room. Just like that, the op was done, and we were outta there. See ya later, bye!
Apollo:
Um, about that "op"...
Wocky:
Yeah. Didn't go so well after all, did it? I know about the report. I know it's still in me.
Health check-up (appears after "Wocky &amp; Alita")
Trucy:
This health check-up was the Boss's idea, you said?
Wocky:
Yeah. Can you imagine? What's the point of living healthy when you're a G, you know what I'm saying?
Trucy:
But didn't you learn about the bullet at that check-up?
Wocky:
Yeah... That's when I knew that doctor had to pay. Figured I could get that cap pulled after I got my revenge. And hey, I'm still living large now, aren't I?
Apollo:
Incidentally... had you ever had a health check-up before?
Wocky:
Naw, my old man suddenly gets this idea that we all gotta get check-ups! Guess he's getting old. Older, I mean.
Present
Sandals
Apollo:
Wocky... You don't happen to recognize these, do you?
Wocky:
Hey! Sure I do! I was the one who bought 'em for her.
Trucy:
For... Ms. Tiala?
Wocky:
Yeah. A birthday present. She's got mad little feet. Mad! So cute, man.
Trucy:
So these sandals are hers...
Apollo:
Yeah... I kinda had a feeling.
Wocky:
What's up with the funky vibes?
Apollo:
(*sigh*...)
Sandals updated in the Court Record.
Wocky's Chart
Wocky:
Huh? What's that? Some kinda X-ray? Wait...
Apollo:
That's right, Wocky. It's yours.
Wocky:
Hey look, I don't smoke or nothing. I'll live long, right?
Trucy:
I don't think he gets it, Apollo...
Apollo:
Ah, take a closer look. Here, in particular... ...where it says "Nurse". ...It's signed "Alita Tiala".
Wocky:
...Huh. You lawyers do your homework.
Trucy:
So, you met Ms. Tiala when you...
Wocky:
Yeah, I met her at the clinic. So?
Apollo:
Could you tell us a bit about the circumstances of your meeting?
Wocky:
Fine, fine! I'll tell you how we met if you want to know that bad.
Anything else
Wocky:
... Man... that is so far off the hook, it's off the chain, G!
Apollo:
(He seems preoccupied with something else...)
Wocky:
...Wonder how my Alita's doing. Man, I miss her.
Examine evidence
Sandals
Toe print
Apollo:
(If these sandals belong to Ms. Tiala... ...then is this print hers, too?)
Trucy:
Something wrong?
Apollo:
No... Nothing.
June 16
Eldoon's House
Trucy:
Mr. Eldoon! We've been looking all over for you!
Guy:
What's the matter, Trucy-doll?
Trucy:
Apollo! Show him what we found! Nothing like expert advice!
Apollo:
(I... suppose he is a doctor still...)
Guy:
... *sniffle*
Apollo:
Mr. Eldoon! Is everything OK?
Guy:
I'm just *sniffle* so happy! I just thought my doctor days were gone for good. *sniffle*
Apollo:
Mr. Eldoon...
Present
Wocky's Chart
Leads to:
"Um, Mr. Eldoon, could you take a look at this?"
Apollo:
Um, Mr. Eldoon, could you take a look at this?
Guy:
Hrm? A medical chart? Hey, you shouldn't go around taking these from clinics! ...
Trucy:
Why the sudden silence, Mr. Eldoon?
Guy:
What...? What's going on here!?
Apollo:
That's what we want to know! That chart belongs to my client.
Trucy:
He's on trial... On suspicion of murder.
Guy:
On trial! That's crazy! You can't put him on trial! He's ABD!
Trucy:
...ABD?
Guy:
All but dead. He's knocking on the Pearly Gates, and someone's about to answer.
Apollo:
C-Can you tell us why?
Guy:
... Well, permit me to speak as a surgeon... You listen up good now, son.
Apollo:
(No way... It's like he's a completely different person...)
Talk
Wocky's chart
Guy:
Well, according to this chart... this "Wocky Kitaki" feller's not doing so well. He's got a bullet right up side his heart!
Apollo:
That's right.
Guy:
Yeah, but this chart talks about the post-op... In other words, the operation is already finished! ...But you can still see that bullet stuck in there.
Apollo:
Why would it still be in there after the operation to remove it?
Guy:
Well, 'bout the only reason I can think of is, it was too tricky to operate on.
Trucy:
What...?
Guy:
That bullet's snug as a bug there next to the aorta, which is connected to the heart. Heck, that scrap of metal's just surrounded by blood vessels. Kind of a miracle. Two millimeters to either side and there'd be some serious bleeding going on in there. Not something yer average doc'd be eager to fiddle with.
Trucy:
Y-You mean...
Guy:
It took a miracle to get that bullet stuck where it is. I'd take more than a miracle to take it out. It'd take a magician.
Apollo:
...
Trucy:
Um... I'm only up to making rabbits disappear. I haven't learned bullets yet.
Guy:
'Course with the heart pumping and lungs working... That bullet's on the move. I'd give him another half a year, tops.
Apollo:
B-But Wocky's operation was already a half-year ago!
Guy:
That's why I'm saying you're outta time! This kid shouldn't be on trial! He should be on an operating table!
Apollo:
(Great... Just great...)
Meraktis's dilemma (appears after "Wocky's chart")
Leads to:
"How could Dr. Meraktis do such a terrible thing?"
Present
Anything
Apollo:
Um, Mr. Eldoon, could you take a look at this?
Guy:
You think we got time for that? Well, we don't. You see me without my bowl on, you're looking at a man who means business. So stop beating around the bush and get cutting!
Apollo:
(Better hear what he has to say while he's in a talkative mood...)
Trucy:
How could Dr. Meraktis do such a terrible thing? How could he just leave that bullet in there?
Guy:
I got a pretty good idea of how he felt... An emergency operation... He's got the kid's chest open on the table. Then he finds that bullet... That's despair right there, Trucy-doll. Cold despair.
Trucy:
Despair...
Guy:
'Bout the only thing he could do is sew the boy back up. He wasn't exactly in the situation to go admitting he couldn't take it out.
Trucy:
The Kitakis...
Guy:
You bet. This kid's their only son, I hear. So, he skips the operation, and Wocky's back on the street living his life. 'Course, it's only a matter of time before his heart hemorrhages and he drops cold.
Trucy:
How awful...!
Guy:
And which doctor would they take him to? Meraktis. He's got enough ties to them, he could probably cover up the truth of what happened.
Trucy:
That's just horrible! He left Wocky to die!
Guy:
There's a darkness in this world, Trucy-doll. Waiting, hungry. Compared to it, these gangs' turf wars are like kid games. When you're up against real evil... Well, it don't matter if you're weak or strong. It'll take you all the same.
Trucy:
... You were a surgeon, right Mr. Eldoon!? You could operate on Wocky, couldn't you!?
Guy:
...I wish.
Trucy:
What...?
Guy:
I'm afraid there ain't nobody in the country that could. Maybe not even in the world...
Trucy:
So... So Wocky...
Guy:
He's real lucky to be alive even now.
Trucy:
No...!
Apollo:
There's one problem...
Trucy:
Apollo?
Apollo:
This chart... Look at the "Nurse" section... ...Alita Tiala.
Trucy:
That's right! This operation was how they met.
Apollo:
Yeah, the problem is, she knew. She knew about Wocky's condition, guaranteed.
Trucy:
Ah...
Apollo:
Why didn't she ever tell him?
Guy:
...
Apollo:
(It doesn't make sense... If she knew her patient was in serious danger... ...you'd think she'd want to get that second operation before getting engaged!)
Trucy:
What was she thinking!? Apollo?
Apollo:
(What were you thinking, Alita Tiala...?)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Apollo:
No clues here.
Exit footprint analysis session
Ema:
Huh? Giving up already? Suit yourself. If you want to take another swing at it, just let me know.
Running out of plaster during footprint analysis session
Ema:
What are you doing!? Out of plaster already?
Apollo:
Hey, give me a break! I'm just a beginner at this!
Ema:
I'm not that far ahead of you, believe me! ...Fine. I'll make another batch. Don't mess it up this time.
Apollo:
(Plaster, here comes Justice! *sigh*)
