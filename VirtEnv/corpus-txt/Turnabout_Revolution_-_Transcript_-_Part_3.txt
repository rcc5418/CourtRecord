May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3
Apollo:
What do you mean Ms. Fey is still being held hostage? And who's this "mastermind"?
Phoenix:
...Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a puppet. His benefactor was the one pulling the strings. But I have no idea who they are.
Apollo:
So all we know is it's the person he was trying to give the orb to?
Phoenix:
Right. He was just following orders. Whoever it is, it seems they really want to get their hands on the orb.
Apollo:
So then, Ms. Fey's abduction is the work of this so-called "benefactor," too?
Phoenix:
Right again. Whoever they are, they're in Khura'in... ...along with Maya.
Apollo:
I wonder who they could be.
Dhurke:
Wright, this Maya -- the spirit medium you've been talking about... She wouldn't happen to be that bun-haired young lady you defended back in Khura'in?
Phoenix:
That's her. Why do you ask?
Dhurke:
I see... I think I know what's going on here.  I've got good news for you, Wright. Maya is somewhere safe. That much I'm sure of.
Phoenix:
...I'm afraid you've lost me.
Dhurke:
Heh heh heh. So that's who the little snot's patron is. It's all starting to make sense. That fool has no idea I'm here in the States with you all.
Apollo:
Dhurke, you mind filling us in?
Phone:
..........................................
Phoenix:
...! ...No caller ID. I wonder who's calling?
Phone:
*beep*
Phoenix:
Hello?
Phone:
Mr. Phoenix Wright, yes? Let me start by thanking you... ...for taking such good care of my subordinate.
Phoenix:
Wh-Who is this?
Phone:
I believe you know me as Mr. Atishon's... "benefactor."
Phoenix:
Ah!
Apollo:
(Sounds like they're using a voice changer or something to disguise themself.)
Phoenix:
Where's Maya?! Is she safe?!
Phone:
...I had my ears on today's proceedings. What a shock it was to hear that the key to solving the orb's riddle is a spirit medium. I admit, I did not see that coming.
Apollo:
(Wait, did they plant a listening device in here somehow?)
Phone:
Nevertheless, don't think for a minute that it will guarantee Maya Fey's safety. She is not the only medium within my reach, you see.
Phoenix:
You harm a hair on Maya's head and you'll have to answer to me!
Dhurke:
...Wright, give it here a sec.
Phoenix:
Wait!
Dhurke:
Hey, there. How's it going, stranger?
Phone:
...Who is this?
Dhurke:
Why, it's your friendly neighborhood dragon. I just happen to be in the U.S. on a little trip. ...Minister of Justice Inga Karkhuul Khura'in.
Phoenix:
I-Inga?!
Apollo:
What?!
Phoenix:
Maya's kidnapper...
Apollo:
...Is Khura'in's... Minister of Justice?
Inga:
Dh-Dhurke?! Is that you, ya dirty turncoat?! How in the--! What in blazes is going on here?!
Dhurke:
Oh, you know, just popped over to the States for a little R&amp;R. But enough about me, Inga. That was a poor excuse for a bluff you pulled just now. We both know your threats are as empty as your head. You can't lay a hand on Maya Fey, and I do mean that literally.
Inga:
Ugh!
Apollo:
(What is he talking about?)
Dhurke:
You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye.
Inga:
...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke.
Dhurke:
What?
Inga:
I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right?
Dhurke:
! ............
Inga:
Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Meet me at Amara's Tomb tomorrow, 3 PM sharp. And you better come alone, got it? If all goes well, the orb is all you'll need to get Maya Fey back.
Dhurke:
.........
Apollo:
Dh-Dhurke, what's going on?
Dhurke:
You heard him. I have to get back to Khura'in at once.
Apollo:
What?! Why?!
Dhurke:
No time to explain.
Apollo:
But are you even going to make it? What if there are no seats left on the next flight? Plus, you're a wanted man. They're not just going to let you get on a plane.
???:
Let me worry about that, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
Ch-Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth? What are you doing here?
Edgeworth:
Taking care of the hostage situation.
Apollo:
Oh, now that you mention it... ...Pearl did say that she saw you around in Kurain Village.
Phoenix:
I had him look into a few things while I was on my way back from Khura'in. ...Including Maya's situation, of course.
Edgeworth:
I was astonished to hear she was still in Khura'in earlier... ...but it explained why I found no connection between her and Mr. Atishon.
Apollo:
Sorry to interrupt, but going back to the plane situation...
Edgeworth:
I've taken the liberty of chartering one for us. It's ready to take off at any time. And I will do what's necessary to hide the fact that Dhurke Sahdmadhi is onboard.
Apollo:
...Wow. (Must be nice to be chief prosecutor...)
Edgeworth:
Wright, we have no time to lose. We must head for Khura'in at once.
Phoenix:
...Right.
Athena:
I'm going, too! After all, you're bound to need my help!
Trucy:
No fair! I wanna go, too!
Phoenix:
This isn't a vacation, Trucy. Besides, I'll need you to hold down the fort.
Trucy:
But Daddy!
Apollo:
(Guess I should also only bring what's necessary.) ...Sorry Trucy, but would you mind holding on to this stuff for me?
Unnecessary evidence foisted onto Trucy.
Trucy:
Fine. But you'd better bring me back something besides just more evidence.
Dhurke:
Excellent. Now, let us make haste... to Khura'in!
Apollo:
And that's how our sudden trip to the Kingdom of Khura'in began. I never imagined I'd return to the country of my youth under such circumstances, though... 
May 18, 2:30 PMTehm'pul Temple
Apollo:
That was a long flight. It's already 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about cutting it close. ........... (The Kingdom of Khura'in... This is no time to reminisce, but... ...I gotta say, this place sure brings back memories.)
Phoenix:
Hurry up, Apollo! 
Apollo:
Right behind you!
Dhurke:
Amara's Tomb is located in the courtyard of Ga'ran Palace. We should have just enough time to get there.
Athena: 
Then let's sprint there! Think you can keep up, Apollo?
Apollo:
S-Sure, no sweat!
Edgeworth:
I'll contact the royal family and the local police, and inform them of our arrival.
Phoenix:
Thanks, Edgeworth.
Examine
Athena:
Apollo. I'm sure this place brings back memories, but could you reminisce later? Time's running out!
Apollo:
You're right. We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late.
Talk
Any ideas?
Athena:
I know you probably want to reminisce and all, but there's no time for that right now!
Apollo:
You're right. We've got to get to Amara's Tomb with Ms. Fey is being held captive!
Present

Athena:
Apollo! Don't go showing me stuff for no reason! We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late!

Royal Residence
Leads to:
May 18, 2:45 PM
Ga'ran Palace – Royal Residence
May 18, 2:45 PMGa'ran Palace – Royal Residence
Apollo:
*{huff, puff* *huff, puff* I wasn't made for all the running and climbing and near-drowning I've done this week.
Phoenix:
It's 2:45... Only 15 minutes left.
Dhurke:
See that cylindrical building rising in the distance? That's Amara's Tomb.
Phoenix:
Amara... Wasn't that the previous queen? The one who was assassinated?
Dhurke:
Yes. And I'm the one they pinned it on
Apollo:
It will take a few minutes to get to the tomb from here.
???:
So, you have returned... Barbed Head.
Phoenix:
Ah...!
Apollo:
(I've seen her before on the news. If I remember correctly, this is the crown princess Rayfa Padma Khura'in.)
Rayfa:
What are you people doing here? This is the Royal Residence! Commoners are not allowed entry without permission.
Phoenix:
A prosecutor from the States... ...should've already called and requested permission for us to enter. As to why we're here, Your Benevolence... Have you seen Minister Inga?
Rayfa:
If you seek my father, I just saw him heading toward Amara's Tomb.
Phoenix:
Was he with anyone? You know, like some shady-looking underlings or something?
Rayfa:
No, he was alone. Why do you ask?
Apollo:
(Looks like she has no idea about Ms. Fey's abduction.)
Athena:
You hear that? I think we have company.
*stomp, stomp, stomp*
Royal Guard:
Bow down before her glooooooory!!! Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in approooooooooaches!!!
Apollo:
Huh? ...Ga'ran? Ahhh! I-It's--!
Phoenix:
...Q-Queen Ga'ran!
Ga'ran:
............... Guards... Surround Amara's Tomb at once!
Royal Guard:
Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Ur di'hara Ga'ran!
Apollo:
(What's she doing? Is she going to help us?)
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Your Eminence...
Ga'ran:
So, our "Barbed Head" lawyer returns. May we presume you are here for Maya Fey, the spirit medium who has been abducted?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, you may!
Ga'ran:
Allow us to apologize for the criminal actions of our husband.
Phoenix:
Oh, um... no need to apologize for him!
Ga'ran:
Honestly, Inga... Abducting a guest in our country? How could you?
Rayfa:
Father... abducted someone?
Phoenix:
Your Eminence, what about those soldiers over there?
Ga'ran:
They are the Ga'ran Royal Guard, soldiers who serve the crown and no other.
Apollo:
Royal guard?
Ga'ran:
They are an elite force selected from only the most loyal and outstanding of our subjects.
Apollo:
And why have you ordered them to surround the tomb?
Ga'ran:
The police will not come if it is my husband who is committing the crime. We shall have to storm the tomb and take Minister Inga into custody ourselves!
Apollo:
Whaaat?! Y-You mean...?
Dhurke:
Ga'ran! No! His hostage is in there!
Ga'ran:
Dhurke! How dare you set foot in the palace! Have you come to turn yourself in?!
Dhurke:
Listen, we need to call a truce for now!
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran Royal Guard! Seize this traitor of the crown!
Royal Guard:
As you wiiiiiiish, Your Eminence! Resist and you diiiiiie!
Apollo:
W-Wait a second!
???:
Dhurke:
Slow down there, Ga'ran. I'm here to conduct a hostage exchange. But if you take me in now, Maya Fey is as good as dead.
Ga'ran:
...A hostage exchange? And why would he choose to do such a thing with you?
Dhurke:
We can talk about that later. Right now, I need to get in there before it's too late. If I can't resolve this in twenty minutes, you can storm the palace. Now then... if you'll excuse me...
Ga'ran:
Dhurke, wait! ... *sigh* Guards, allow the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi to pass.
Rayfa:
Barbed Head, you have some explaining to do!
Phoenix:
Right... Well, while we're waiting here... ...Apollo, why don't you explain the situation?
Apollo:
Whaaat?! M-Me?
Rayfa:
Leave nothing out, Horn Head, or I'll dehorn you where you stand!
Apollo:
(Horn Head? She doesn't waste any time coming up with nicknames. And what's with the attitude? Her father is the one who abducted Ms. Fey!)

Apollo:
(This is no time to be looking around. Not until Dhurke gets back.)
Talk
Hostage taking by Inga
Rayfa:
Do my ears deceive me, or did I hear talk about my father abducting someone?
Apollo:
Oh, um, you heard right. He abducted Maya Fey, and...
Rayfa:
I-Insolent fool!
Apollo:
P-Pardon my rudeness!
Rayfa:
A gentle soul such as my father could not possibly have committed such a crime!
Phoenix:
"Gentle"? You think he's gentle? 
Apollo:
I'm afraid it's true, Your Benevolence. He's holed up in that tomb as we speak.
Rayfa:
Really? I find this difficult to believe. Why would he do such a thing?
Inga Karkhuul Khura'in
Apollo:
Umm, Your Benevolence? You saw your father heading toward the tomb?
Rayfa:
I did. I was over on that veranda, deep in thought... ...when I saw him hurrying toward the tomb. I'd say it was about 10 minutes ago. 
Apollo:
(Why was he rushing? Maybe he was worried he'd be late?) Did you see anyone else heading for the tomb?
Rayfa:
I saw no one else after he entered.
Apollo:
So Minister Inga and Ms. Fey are the only ones in there besides Dhurke?
Phoenix:
Who knows? But I wouldn't be surprised if he had a minion or two with him.
Apollo:
Dhurke... I sure hope he's all right.
Present
Anything
Rayfa:
Horn Head! Stop wasting time and explain what's going on here! And make it quick, or I'll yank those horns right off your head.
Apollo:
Nngh... How about we keep our hands to ourselves and I'll explain everything...? (Guess I'd better start talking...)
Move
Rayfa:
Where do you think you are going?!
Apollo:
(Oh, right. We're supposed to wait for Dhurke to return.)
Apollo:
...It's only been five minutes? (Argh, it feels like an eternity.)
Phoenix:
Patience, Apollo, patience.
Ga'ran:
.................
May 18, 3:20 PMGa'ran Palace – Royal Residence
Apollo:
It's been almost twenty minutes. What's taking Dhurke so long?
Ga'ran:
...The appointed time has come. Our royal guard shall now storm in.
Apollo:
Umm, can't you wait just a little longer?
Ga'ran:
No, we cannot. Every second we wait puts the hostage's life in even more danger. Therefore, we see no alternative but to order our guards to storm in.
Apollo:
(But that'll put Ms. Fey's life in danger, too!)
Ga'ran:
Guards! Storm the tomb and seize Minister Inga, along with the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi!
Royal Guard:
Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence!
Apollo:
What?! Dhurke's under arrest, too?
Ga'ran:
Naturally. That traitorous snake assassinated my predecessor, Queen Amara. Now go! Seize them both!
Royal Guard:
Raaaaaaaaah! We're going in! Follow me, men! For Her Eminenece! Ur dihara Ga'raaaaaaaan!
Apollo:
............ (I hope no one gets hurt.)
Royal Guard:
Ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Your Eminineeeeeeeence!
Apollo:
What the--? Why are they running back out?!
Ga'ran:
What is the meaning of this?
Royal Guard:
S-Something terrible has happened! Dhurke...! Th-Th-The minister...! H-H-He's dead!
Ga'ran:
What's this?!
Apollo:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Phoenix:
Apollo, quick!
Apollo:
I'm right behind you!
Ga'ran:
No one enters without our--! ...Hmph! Come, let us see what has transpired!
Royal Guard:
Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence!

Apollo:
Wh-Where's Dhurke?!
Phoenix:
Apollo, over there!
Apollo:
.........Dhurke?
Dhurke:
................
Apollo:
Dhurke! Wh-Wh-What... What have you done?
Dhurke:
..........Apollo?
Phoenix:
L-Look!
Ga'ran:
So it is... Minister Inga who has fallen? ...! Guards! Seize this murderous man at once!
Royal Guard:
Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Surrender or peeeeeeerish, rebel scum!
Dhurke:
N-No, wait! Aaaaaaaaargh!

Apollo:
Dhurke! (They're taking him away...)
*thud*
Apollo:
Oww! (Dhurke just threw something at me.) Wait, this is the... (Is he telling me to keep it safe?)
???:
......Nick? ...Is that you?
Phoenix:
M-Maya! Are you all right?!
Maya:
Dh-Dhurke, he... he saved me. ...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open...
Phoenix:
Maya!
Apollo:
(Minister Inga -- the man behind Ms. Fey's abduction -- had been killed. And Dhurke was arrested for his murder. So it was that the abduction of Maya Fey came to a sudden and unexpected resolution. With this, the curtain fell on the minister, but things were far from over.)
May 18Ga'ran Palace – Royal Residence
Athena:
Apollo! What happened?!
Apollo:
......I can't say for sure. But from what I can tell, it seems Dhurke has killed Minister Inga.
Athena:
Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! You think he did it to save Ms. Fey?
Apollo:
Most likely... But who knows? I'm really confused right now...
Rayfa:
M-My father... He's...? This cannot be! I must see for myself!
Royal Guard:
Your Benevolence! We cannot allow you to pass!
Rayfa:
Fools! Stand aside!
Royal Guard:
Forgive us! But we have direct orders from Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran!
Rayfa:
Uuuuuuuuuuuh! Father... Oh, Father...! Dhuuuuuurke! You will pay for this!
Phoenix:
...Apollo, let's go regroup somewhere.
Apollo:
Y-Yeah... (Dhurke... It wasn't really you that did it... right?)
May 18Tehm'pul Temple
Apollo:
.........
Athena:
Are you okay, Apollo?
Apollo:
...Y-Yeah.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth's speaking with the local police... ...so let's sit tight until he returns.
Apollo:
...O-Okay. ...............
Phoenix:
...I know you must be in a state of shock right now, but I need you to stay with us, Apollo.
Apollo:
(He's right. I can't go to pieces now!) Thanks, Mr. Wright. I'll be fine!
May 18Tehm'pul Temple
Edgeworth:
Wright, Mr. Justice... I'm afraid I have some bad news. It looks like things will only get more complicated from here.
Apollo:
Prosecutor Edgeworth... What's happening with Dhurke?
Edgeworth:
As I understand it, he has been officially charged with the murder of Minister Inga.
Apollo:
H-He has?
Edgeworth:
However, I did manage to get us permission to investigate the crime scene. And I expect we'll be allowed to visit Mr. Sahdmadhi shortly.
Apollo:
...Thank you. (I'm sure glad Prosecutor Edgeworth is here with us.)
Edgeworth:
Also, it just so happens that Detective Skye is here in Khura'in... ...so I have asked her to assist us with our investigation.
Apollo:
What?! What's she doing here?
Edgeworth:
It seems Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has grown quite fond of her. He's been ferrying her around all over the place. A few days here, a few days there... They've almost become a team of sorts.
Apollo:
(Despite what Nahyuta says... ...it seems he thinks highly of Ema's skills.)
Athena:
So what now, Apollo?
Apollo:
I think I'll go pay Dhurke a visit at the Detention Center.
Phoenix:
I... want to go check in on Maya at the hospital. What about you, Athena?
Athena:
Well... If there's footwork to be done, I'd better stick with Apollo and give him a hand.
Edgeworth:
Very well. Then I will accompany Wright.
Apollo:
Okay, we'll go our separate ways for now.
Phoenix:
All right. If anything comes up, you have my cell number.
Athena:
Do you know your way around here, Apollo?
Apollo:
It's been over ten years since I left... but I'll try not to get us hopelessly lost.
Examine
Temple
Athena:
Mr. Wright stayed there the entire time he was here, apparently.
Apollo:
Why would he stay at a temple instead of a hotel?
Athena:
He says it helped to cut costs. Long stays at a hotel really add up, you know. But he had to sleep on the floor with a load of strangers. There weren't any showers, either.
Apollo:
Wow, that's worse than staying at a youth hostel for backpackers.
Spring
Apollo:
(This is said to be a sacred spring, and a pathway for souls to follow. The people of Khura'in believe the spring draws souls to the temple... ...and by the truth gained in the Hall of Justice beyond, they are memorialized. It seems that legal trials and funeral rites are inseparable in this country.)
Background temples
Apollo:
(There sure are a lot of temples around here. In fact, it looks like most of the buildings around here are related to Khura'inism.)
Talk
Any ideas?
Athena:
Queen Ga'ran sure has a lot of personal attendants.
Apollo:
Yeah. The Ga'ran Royal Guard... They're like her own private army.
Athena:
More like an elite fan club made up of carefully selected soldiers who adore her. That's how I see it anyway.
Apollo:
That's... a pretty blunt way of putting it.
What to do
Athena:
Dhurke Sahdmadhi -- the charismatic leader of the Defiant Dragons -- arrested. This is going to deal a major blow to the rebels.
Apollo:
Yeah. I can already see Datz having a heart attack when he finds out.
Athena:
Speaking of Datz, he was on the plane with us... ...but I haven't seen him since we landed.
Apollo:
Dhurke said he wanted Datz to go to him before he caused any more trouble.
Athena:
...Yeah, he strikes me as a troublemaker.
Apollo:
...I just hope he doesn't do anything crazy, like trying to break Dhurke out of jail.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Athena:
I thought that attorney badges were the same around the world. But I just realized this type is only used back home.
Apollo:
You've had your badge for a while now, and you're JUST noticing that?
Athena:
Hey, I'm still getting used to things after all the time I spent in Europe. But as they say, when in Rome!
Apollo:
Wait, what are we even talking about anymore?
Founder's Orb
Athena:
The orb... It was a real surprise to find out that it's hollow on the inside, wasn't it?
Apollo:
Yeah, and an even bigger surprise to find that the founder's face was hidden within.
Athena:
But now that the orb's secret has been revealed... ...how are you supposed to restore it to its original state?
Apollo:
...Well, it was probably wax or something that melted to reveal the figure inside, so... ...if we turned it upside down and heated it up again, it should go back to the way it was.
Athena:
Ohhh, I get it! That's one clever little contraption.
Photo of My Father
Athena:
I've been thinking about that photo. Your father was quite the manly man, Apollo.
Apollo:
Ha ha ha. I sense a compliment in there somewhere.
Athena:
Huh? Where'd you get that idea?
Apollo:
Oh, um... N-Never mind.
Athena:
Never mind what?
Apollo:
......... Er, nice weather we're having today.
Athena:
......... Aww... Is there something you wanted to hear me say, Apollo?
Apollo:
L-Look! Just forget I said anything, okay?!

Dhurke:
Apollo! Here to see your old man, are you?
Apollo:
Dhurke. Are they done interrogating you?
Dhurke:
Nope, the fun hasn't even started. I imagine they'll really take me over the coals though.
Athena:
I don't even want to think about how harsh their interrogation method will be.
Apollo:
...Yeah, but that's nothing compared to what they'll do if they find him guilty.
Dhurke:
They've branded me a terrorist who killed the previous queen, and now the justice minister. If found guilty of these crimes, I'll be facing a very public execution.
Apollo:
P-Public execution...?! (This is worse than I thought!)
Dhurke:
Come on, son. Turn that frown upside down! You'll jinx us. As soon as I get out of here, I'll take you to this tasty hash house I know.
Apollo:
.........I'd like that. (I really need to find out what happened. Time to switch to work mode.) Dhurke, can you tell me what happened? ...Oh, and there's also something I want you to take a look at.
Examine
Bell
Athena:
..................
Apollo:
...Don't do it, Athena. Don't ring that bell.
Athena:
Ack! Wh-Who, me...?! Perish the thought. I mean, would I ever do something so childish?
Apollo:
..................
Athena:
All right, all right! Put your bracelet away already. Talk about unfair!
Guard
Apollo:
That guard's standing so still, and with such great posture... I wonder if he spends his days just watching the dust dance in the sunlight. Wait a second. Don't you do that in court sometimes, Athena?
Athena:
Eep! You mean you noticed?
Apollo:
Don't think you can take it easy just because I'm the lead lawyer on this one.
Talk
The incident
Apollo:
Dhurke, what happened in there? You didn't really kill Minister Inga, did you?
Dhurke:
Well, the thing is... ...I really don't know.
Apollo:
Huh?
Dhurke:
I remember seeing the mural of the founder right as I entered the tomb... ...but I got all dizzy immediately after that. The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand... ...and covered in Inga's blood.
Apollo:
So you don't remember meeting with him?
Dhurke:
No. The last thing I remember after entering the tomb is feeling really dizzy.
Athena:
There's no way he can explain what happened if he can't remember anything.
Apollo:
Y-Yeah...
Dhurke:
.........Hmm. I suppose there's no getting out of this one.
Apollo:
But we can't give up yet!
Dhurke:
Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I was just messing with you, son.
Apollo:
Well, stop. It's not funny.
Dhurke:
S-Sorry.
Apollo:
(Sheesh. Nothing seems to faze him. Not even being arrested for murder.)
Dhurke:
This is going to be one tough case, Apollo. Not only have I been charged with Inga's murder... ...but I've also been charged with Amara's assassination from twenty-three years ago.
Apollo:
You're on trial for two charges?
Dhurke:
Ga'ran is practically licking her chops just thinking about my public execution. Guess it means we can't afford to lose our heads, huh. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
I... I don't know how you can laugh at a time like this.
Dhurke:
...So, son, I take it you'll be defending me at my trial?
Apollo:
...Of course. You can count on me.
Dhurke:
That's my boy! Looks like your nerves are as steely as those vocal chords of yours! After all, you've got the Defense Culpability Ace to contend with, too.
Apollo:
...Oh, right... So if you're found guilty... ...then I'll be charged with the same double homicide, huh.
Dhurke:
Don't tell me you forgot about that...!
Apollo:
I'll-- I'll be fine. I-I just have to make sure we win this one.
Dhurke:
You sure? Because you don't sound very fine.
Athena:
...Um, Apollo? What was that about an assassination twenty-three years ago?
23 years ago (appears after "The incident")
Apollo:
About that incident twenty-three years ago... That was when the previous queen, Amara, was assassinated, wasn't it?
Dhurke:
Yes. Someone set her private residence on fire. She lost her life in the ensuing blaze.
Apollo:
And you were arrested for the crime?
Athena:
Why would they arrest you, Mr. Sahdmadhi? Weren't you just a lawyer back then? What relation could you have had with the queen?
Dhurke:
Um, about that... Amara was... well... she was my wife. I may not look the part, but I was once husband to a queen. In short, I was royalty.
Athena:
What? No waaaaaay! Are you saying you won the heart of the reigning queen?
Dhurke:
Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! C'mon, you're talking to a guy who hones his prowess against witnesses on the stand. Even a queen is no match for this dragon's glare!
Athena:
W-Wow, you're really something else.
Apollo:
So was a verdict ever reached, Dhurke?
Dhurke:
I acted as my own attorney and won. ...Until I was accused of fabricating evidence, that is. Then it all went south.
Apollo:
(...Now where have I heard a story like that before?)
Athena:
What happened after that?
Dhurke:
I, uh... I made a run for it.
Athena:
You ran?! But why?
Dhurke:
I didn't kill Amara, and I didn't fabricate any evidence. But if I had stuck around for a retrial, I'd have been found guilty for sure. I couldn't allow that to happen; Amara's true killer would never face justice if I did. So I left my law practice behind and went underground.
Apollo:
But that was twenty-three years ago. ...Are you telling me that after all these years... ...you still haven't discovered the truth?
Dhurke:
Yeah... The fact that it was arson means that the crime scene was reduced to ashes. There is little in the way of evidence left. It's just been brick wall after brick wall.
Apollo:
(I guess that means it's all up to me to figure it out, huh. Along with Minister Inga's murder, of course. ...I think I'm going to be sick.)
Dhurke:
Come on, son. Don't look so down. With you on the case, it'll work out somehow.
Apollo:
(I hope he's right.)
Dhurke:
Say, son, do you remember my office?
Apollo:
...Sure. ( I remember that messy, dimly lit room.)
Dhurke:
The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there?
Apollo:
(Let me think... I recall going in through a manhole...) How can I not, Dhurke. i hated how I always got so dirty getting there. And that stench... (That old case is important, too, but I should probably focus on the minister's murder first.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Dhurke:
I'm proud of you, son. You've really become a fine lawyer.
Apollo:
Well, at least it means I'm qualified to defend you.
Dhurke:
...To think the day would come where you'd come to my defense. I'm one lucky man. Now I can die in peace.
Apollo:
Whoa, slow down! I'm going to prove you innocent, so...!
Dhurke:
Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Just pulling your leg, son!
Apollo:
(...Even when he's in the slammer, Dhurke is Dhurke.)
Founder's Orb
Dhurke:
I see you got it safely out of the tomb!
Apollo:
Why did you throw it at me like that?
Dhurke:
I want you to listen carefully, son. The orb must not fall into Ga'ran's hands... not ever.
Apollo:
I thought Minister Inga was the one who was after it. He was the one who lent it to Professor Buff to study, after all. So haven't you exposed his crime now?
Dhurke:
I have, but... ...there's more connected to this relic than meets the eye... Much more. And whatever it is, I can't help feeling that it could turn this entire kingdom upside down.
Apollo:
You said something like that before. (Looks like Dhurke's intuition is at it again.)
Dhurke:
Ga'ran will do anything to retrieve this... ...so guard it well, son -- at least until tomorrow's trial.
Photo of My Father
Dhurke:
That's the only remaining photo of your father. Take good care of it.
Apollo:
I will. ...I'm just surprised to see it after all these years.
Dhurke:
I had a tough time tracking it down and retrieving it. It was taken by some European tourists who just happened to be watching your father. I had one of my men go to Europe to look them up and ask whether we could have it.
Apollo:
Y-You went through all that trouble?
Dhurke:
...I did. So don't go losing it or anything.
Apollo:
I said I'd take good care of it, didn't I?
???:
I'm afraid your time is up.
Apollo:
! N-Nahyuta.
Nahyuta:
It's time for the prisoner's interrogation. So begone, you putrid-headed, criminal-abetting lawyer.
Apollo:
Wait! Don't tell me... you're the prosecuting attorney?
Athena:
What?! But that would mean...
Nahyuta:
...Is there a problem here?
Apollo:
You bet there is. He's your father!
Nahyuta:
...And your point is...? My relation to the accused is irrelevant. The fact remains, I am a prosecutor.
Apollo:
N-No, that's not what I... (I don't think I'm getting through to him.)
Dhurke:
.........Nahyuta. Long time no see, son. How've you been?
Nahyuta:
.........
Dhurke:
Look... I hear you've been serving Ga'ran -- rather faithfully, in fact. Whatever happened to our dream of taking her down and changing this country, son?
Nahyuta:
.........The past is the past.
Dhurke:
What do you mean? Why are you doing this?
Nahyuta:
.........It's simple. People change. The Nahyuta you knew exists no more.
Dhurke:
Listen, son, I don't know what made you change like this... ...but you're still my boy, even if you prosecute my case. The rest of the Defiant Dragons and I eagerly await your return. Whenever you're ready, we'll welcome you back with open arms.
Nahyuta:
........Ngh! .........As I said, I've moved on. Now, let us waste no more time; for flowers do not blossom simply from talk of the past.
Apollo:
......... (Nahyuta... Why do I get the feeling there's something he wants to say, but can't?)
Nahyuta:
...Guard, move the accused to the interrogation room.
Guard:
Yes, sir! This way, you rebel scum!
Dhurke:
Ow! Watch it! Not so rough, will you!
Apollo:
(...Nahyuta. Is he seriously going to prosecute his own father?)
May 18Ga'ran Palace - Amara's Tomb
Apollo:
So, this is the tomb of Amara, the previous queen of Khura'in. It's really lavish. I guess you could say it's fit for a queen.
Athena:
Is the faceless woman in that mural over there Amara?
Apollo:
No, that's the Holy Mother. She's the one who brought spirit channeling to Khura'in.
Athena:
Oh, right. The woman in the orb.
???:
Oh, it's you two. Getting right down to business, I see.
Apollo:
Hi, Ema. We heard you'd give us a hand if we needed it.
Ema:
Yep. Mr. Edgeworth asked me to help where I could. So, it's been quite a while since you've been back in Khura'in, I hear.
Apollo:
Yeah, more than ten years, in fact.
Ema:
Well, you sure didn't waste any time. I mean, you're already mixed up in a murder. You're as big a trouble magnet as Mr. Wright.
Apollo:
P-Please don't say that. My luck's already bad enough as it is.
Athena:
Ema, I hear Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has requested your services again. He seems to have really taken a liking to you.
Ema:
You mean His Ephemeral Holiness? MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. I don't mind that he approves of me and my abilities. It's just, his people skills need some serious work. But when he manages a smile and compliments my work, it's hard to say no. Plus, working on investigations overseas is a priceless experience. But flying back and forth between here and home every few days with no days off... That's been tough, and the lack of sleep has been brutal on my skin. To make matters worse, the defendant in this case is someone I know. I mean, how could this get any worse?! MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
Apollo:
(Sounds like they've got one complicated prosecutor-detective relationship going on.)
Examine (before clearing all Talk options)
Apollo:
(We better get Ema's okay before we start snooping around.)
Talk
The incident
Apollo:
Ema, have you determined the cause of death?
Ema:
Blood loss from a stab wound. A single stab in the back was enough to cause the victim to bleed to death. The estimated time of death is 3 PM, which is when Dhurke came onto the scene.
Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Apollo:
Any suspects besides Dhurke?
Ema:
No. He, Maya, and the minister were the only ones here. And Maya had been tied up until she was freed by the queen's royal guard.
Apollo:
Could someone have been hiding somewhere in here?
Ema:
Not likely. I was told this tomb was searched from top to bottom right after the murder. And during that time, the royal guard set up a perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping.
Athena:
In other words, the crime scene was completely sealed off?
Ema:
It would appear so.
Apollo:
Hmm... No way for a third party to escape without being spotted, so... (Great. It's another one of those convoluted locked-room mysteries.)
The victim
Apollo:
About the victim, Minister Inga... He was the kingdom's Minister of Justice, correct?
Ema:
Yes. Inga Karkhuul Khura'in was the second most powerful figure in Khura'in. Plus, he was married to the queen.
Apollo:
Seems strange that someone of his status would abduct someone.
Ema:
Apparently, he only told a few of his most loyal subordinates about his plan. That way, there was little chance of the police or even the queen finding out.
Apollo:
What was Inga hoping to gain by getting his hands on the orb?
Ema:
That I don't know. But I'm working on it.
Apollo:
(...I wonder if it really was for what Paul Atishon-Wimperson said...?)
Atishon:
I must deliver it to my benefactor at all costs.
Phoenix:
What do they want that relic for anyway?
Atishon:
Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret.
Apollo:
(A great power that is said to be bestowed on whoever solves the orb's secret. In Khura'in, only those who can channel spirits are said to be fit to rule. Was that why Inga wanted such power? Did he want to be king?)
Amara's tomb
Apollo:
So this is the tomb of the previous queen?
Ema:
Yes, Queen Amara was laid to rest here. She lost her life in an arsonist's blaze. What a tragic end. I heard this tomb sits on the actual site of her residence before it was burned down. They built it on the same spot so her soul could rest in peace.
Apollo:
(So this is where the fire happened, huh.)
Athena:
Why do you think Minister Inga was holding Ms. Fey captive here?
Ema:
It's the perfect spot, if you think about it. It's close to his private quarters, which made it easy to keep an eye on his prisoner. And the courtyard is only open to the royal family, so he had little fear of prying eyes. Plus, the tomb is normally locked, and only the royal family is allowed access.
Athena:
So that's why he picked this place.
Apollo:
How long had Ms. Fey been held captive?
Ema:
About six days.
Apollo:
Really?! That long?!
Ema:
It appears that she was severely weakened by her prolonged confinement. She passed out as soon as she was freed, and is now on an IV drip at the hospital. She's been asleep ever since.
Examine (after clearing all Talk options)
Amara's sarcophagus (front, while facing Holy Mother painting)
Apollo:
So this is Amara's sarcophagus. Let's take a closer look.
Amara's sarcophagus (side)
Apollo:
The sarcophagus is surrounded by a curtain. I bet someone could've hidden behind it.
Ema:
True, but that's one of the many places the royal guard checked after storming in.
Athena:
Wow, they were really thorough.
Ema:
Yes, well, apparently, one of their members loves mystery novels. He peered into every nook and cranny with an almost frightening amount of gusto. And when he was done, he said: "Very interesting. It's like one of those locked-room mysteries."
Apollo:
Sounds like he's in the wrong line of work.
Amara's sarcophagus (blood spatter)
Athena:
Wow, it's covered in blood.
Apollo:
With a blood spatter this large , it must've gotten all over the killer, too. Come to think of it... There was blood on Dhurke's clothes.
Athena:
The circumstantial evidence points to Dhurke being the killer.
Apollo:
That's what I'd conclude if I were a cop, too. (Why are things always so bleak for me...?)
Sarcophagus curtains
Athena:
Hey, these curtains open, Apollo.
Sarcophagus keyhole
Apollo:
...That's one big sarcophagus.
Ema:
They say the mummy of Amara, the former queen, rests inside.
Apollo:
A mummy, huh? ...Rats, it's locked.
Ema:
Hey, don't touch that!
Apollo:
You mean we can't search inside it?
Ema:
Not a chance. Besides, it's not something anyone'd try opening, anyway.
Apollo:
What if the real killer's hiding inside?
Athena:
Hey! Anyone in there?
Ema:
D-Don't do that! You're going to get us cursed!
Athena:
C-C-Cursed?
Ema:
The queen likely bears a grudge toward the living after such a violent, painful death. So no one dares touch the sarcophagus for fear of incurring her wrath.
Athena:
.........Oh no, Apollo. What am I going to do?
Apollo:
Don't look at me.
Ema:
...In any case, the sarcophagus is temperature controlled. It's kept really cold to preserve the mummy. So even if someone did decide to hide inside it, they would eventually freeze to death.
Apollo:
I see... (Still, if they bundled up, I bet a person could hide in there for a little while.)
Holy Mother mural
Apollo:
It looks like the Holy Mother was painted here to watch over Amara's sarcophagus.
Athena:
So it's like, this tomb is protected by the founder? That must be so reassuring to those she left behind.
Apollo:
Only one problem: they didn't paint the eyes she needs to do said watching.
Athena:
Come to think of it, she doesn't have a mouth to smile down on the tomb with, either. It's actually kind of creepy. I wonder if being watched over by something like that gives the queen nightmares.
Apollo:
...Hey, hey. Keep that up, and the founder just might come and "watch over" you, too.
Broken statue (while facing Holy Mother painting)
Apollo:
Look, one of the statues is broken.
Athena:
Yeah, but it's kind of hard to see from here.
Apollo:
Let's check it out when we get a little closer.
Broken statue (while facing chair)
Apollo:
One of the statues is broken. Let's take a closer look.
Broken statue (while zoomed)
Apollo:
This thing's more splinter than statue now.
Ema:
The bullet from the victim's gun did a real number on it.
Athena:
It seems like something you'd get cursed for, you know?
Apollo:
In Minister Inga's case, I'd say getting your ticket punched is curse enough.
Athena:
Yeah, but don't curses extend to the afterlife?
Apollo:
You need to stop taking what Nahyuta says so seriously.
Athena:
I-I'm perfectly capable of thinking for myself!
Magatama
Apollo:
It's a magatama... I think. Did it come from the broken statue?
Athena:
Look, Apollo, there's another one. But the other statues only have one each.
Apollo:
Hey, you're right. Maybe this statue was special or something.
Bullet
Apollo:
Look, there's a bullet here.
Ema:
It's from the pistol the victim was carrying. My guess is he tried to shoot his attacker, but missed, and the bullet ended up here. We've already determined the rifling marks to be a match to his gun.
Athena:
Rifling marks? Aren't those...?
Ema:
Oh ho! Shall I explain? The science behind it is absolutely fascinating.
Apollo:
No, no, we're good.
Ema:
Hmph, lawyers... Think they're so smart.
Apollo:
You do realize we can hear you.
Sparkling object
Apollo:
Hm? There's something shiny down there. It's a pendant...
Athena:
There's blood on it. I wonder who it belongs to.
Ema:
All we know is it's not the victims. No one in the royal family recognized it.
Apollo:
...Ema, did you lift any fingerprints from it?
Ema:
I did, but... ...I wasn't able to get a clean one.
Apollo:
That's too bad.
Ema:
But the blood turned out to be the victim's.
Apollo:
That means it must have fallen here in the course of the murder. (It might be Dhurke's. I should ask him about it later.)
Pink Butterfly Pendant added to the Court Record.
White outline
Apollo:
Guess this is where Inga collapsed when he died. Better take a closer look.
White outline (while zoomed)
Apollo:
They've already taken the body away. It's kind of sad how familiar I've become with body outlines.
Ema:
I have a photo of the body if you're interested. He was stabbed right in the back; the poor guy was practically skewered.
Athena:
What's he wearing on his arms?
Ema:
Those are the Cuffs of Justice. Seems to be a tradition here for the Minister of Justice to wear those forearm cuffs.
Apollo:
They look like they're made of a thick fabric, so I guess they aren't for protection.
Athena:
Maybe they're for keeping his sleeves out of the way when handling documents.
Apollo:
Yeah, that's probably their original purpose. But over the years, the reason for wearing them was probably forgotten. So now, they're just one of many traditional things that people do without knowing why.
Athena:
...Oh, I get it. Kind of like the way you roll up your sleeves, huh?
Apollo:
...Or your psychology, if we're going there.
Athena:
I happen to know why I started, thank you very much!
Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record.
White outline (while zoomed; subsequent times)
Apollo:
These white lines indicate where the minister's body fell.
Athena:
Hey, didn't Ema give us a photo of the crime scene before they took the body away?
Apollo:
Looks like he was stabbed in the back.
Athena:
Those things on his arms... They're called the "Cuffs of Justice," right?
Apollo:
Yeah, they're supposedly a traditional part of the minister's outfit.
Knife
Apollo:
So, this is the murder weapon. Ema, did you find any prints on it?
Ema:
Yep, and they were super clear. They belong to one Dhurke Sahdmadhi.
Apollo:
That's not good. Were there any others?
Ema:
There was one more print from another individual... ...but it was too smudged to identify. It's probably an old print from someone else who had handled the knife.
Apollo:
Oh... (Yet another piece of unhelpful info to add to our ever-growing pile... *sigh*)
Knife (subsequent times)
Apollo:
The murder weapon...
Athena:
Apparently, Dhurke's prints were found on it.
Apollo:
That's not very helpful, is it.
Cell phone
Apollo:
I wonder if this is Inga's cell phone.
Ema:
It should be. His fingerprints are all over it.
Apollo:
Do you know if he talked with anyone recently?
Ema:
There were a few calls logged between him and his underlings. They're all members of the secret police, who were directly under the minister's control.
Athena:
You mean like spies?
Apollo:
I don't think that's quite it.
Pistol
Apollo:
So the minister was armed, huh.
Ema:
Mm-hm. That's a four-shot pistol. He had it for self-defense, apparently. But it won't be firing anything any time soon.
Apollo:
Huh?
Athena:
He was carrying a broken gun around for show?
Ema:
No, we recovered a bullet here. Which means the gun probably broke as the minister fired its last round. Thing is... the gun's chambers are all empty. Yet, that one bullet is the only bullet we could find.
Apollo:
That is strange. Where did the other three go?
Athena:
...Maybe Dhurke ate them.
Apollo:
We can ask the next time we see him. Just be ready for his predictably "shocking" answer.
Pistol (subsequent times)
Apollo:
Inga's pistol... He used to carry it for self-defense.
Athena:
Apparently, he fired all four rounds.
Apollo:
Yeah, but only one slug was recovered in this tomb.
Rows of statues
Apollo:
It's like a small army of monks, all neatly lined up. It looks like they're facing the sarcophagus in prayer.
Athena:
If you look carefully, each one has a slightly different expression.
Apollo:
I wonder if they used real people as models.
Athena:
Some are frowning, some are smiling... Hm? There's one that looks like he's trying his hardest not to burst out laughing.
Apollo:
...Really? Hmm, I wonder why.
Athena:
Maybe it's like those times when things are so intense, you can't help but laugh. You know, like at funerals and stuff.
Apollo:
They went through all the trouble of depicting that? Talk about going overboard...
Right incense burner
Apollo:
It's full of ash. My guess would be this is an incense burner.
Athena:
Hey, look, Apollo. There's something in the ashes.
Apollo:
...Let's see what it is.
Ash
Apollo:
It's full of ash. They must burn incense in here.
Athena:
So, I was wondering, Apollo... Did the ash come from the incense sticks that were burned in this? Or do people put their incense in after there was already she in here to hold them up?
Apollo:
Don't be silly, Athena. The answer's simple. The ash is the product of prayers from countless visitors who came here. It's not a chicken-or-the-egg kind of thing.
Apollo:
Oh, that's an interesting take on it. It's so much more poetic than mine!
Gemstone
Apollo:
Is that... a gemstone? Wonder what it's doing here.
Athena:
Heh heh heh, I've got this one covered, Apollo. Would you like to hear my brilliant theory?
Apollo:
Well, I guess it wouldn't do any harm.
Athena:
You know how people make wishes by throwing coins into a fountain, right? Well--
Apollo:
You know, on second thought, I'm good.
Athena:
Whaaat?! Y-You sure you don't need to hear my theory? I was just about to get to the good part!
Apollo:
Let's just ask Ema. That'll be much quicker. Excuse me, Ema? What's this gemstone doing here?
Ema:
Oh, that... It's not a gem, it's a button -- albeit a very expensive one -- from the victim's jacket. Must've fallen off and gotten in there somehow.
Apollo:
See? Every puzzle has an answer, Athena.
Athena:
Well, I thought my idea was pretty good... Wait... What's with this soot? See here, on the gemstone.
Apollo:
...Hey, you're right.
Gemstone added to the Court Record.
Grape juice
Apollo:
This is the grape juice Inga was drinking. He was probably nervous before his meeting with Dhurke.
Athena:
So he drank grape juice? I'm not seeing the logic here.
Apollo:
Mr. Wright told me all about it when he was hospitalized a few years ago. He said grape juice has something in it that helps you relax.
Athena:
Really? ...Um, are you sure he was talking about regular, plain old grape juice? Because it sounds like he was talking about the fermented variety.
Apollo:
No, he couldn't have meant that. I mean, we're talking about a medical facility. They wouldn't have allowed something like that in.
Athena:
R-Right... Let's just leave it at that.
Side paintings (while facing Holy Mother mural)
Apollo:
There's a painting up there, but I can't see it very well from here.
Paintings right of Holy Mother mural
Apollo:
A baby on a lotus blossom? That's one strange painting.
Ema:
Apparently, that's part of a mural depicting the life and times of Queen Amara. You know, like a storyboard or something.
Apollo:
So that baby's supposed to be Amara?
Athena:
This one depicts Amara preaching to the faithful.
Apollo:
It's hard to put into words, but I've never seen anything like it. Let's see, the next one is... I-Is that... Dhurke? Why does he have horns?
Athena:
My best guess is... ...it depicts the first time Amara and Dhurke met.
Apollo:
So he's supposed to be some kind of demon who's seducing her?
Athena:
Well, he WAS successful since they got married after that.
Apollo:
...The mural continues on the opposite wall.
Paintings left of Holy Mother mural
Athena
Is this supposed to be Amara channeling a spirit?
Apollo:
It looks like the spirit of some country's sultan or something. And she seems to be conveying something to his retainers.
Athena:
...Sh-She's on fire.
Apollo:
This must be Amara's assassination as allegedly carried out by Dhurke. They really made him look evil.
Athena:
...This is the weirdest one of all.
Apollo:
Is that supposed to be Dhurke facing his punishment in the afterlife? Anyway... Hm? I guess that's the last one.
Athena:
I guess we're supposed to see this as a happy ending.
Apollo:
Yeah, except nobody came out of this story happy.
Chair
Apollo:
Ms. Fey was apparently tied to this chair. Let's take a closer look. We should try to cover every angle possible here. Slide the Touch Screen... ... or use the Circle Pad (Circle Pad) to look around carefully in this area.
Chair (zoomed in)
Apollo:
(...Poor Ms. Fey. She must've been tied up to this chair.)
Athena:
I can just imagine how much her backside must've hurt after sitting here for so long.
Apollo:
It would've been torture for you, I bet. I mean, you don't know how to sit still.
Athena:
If by that you mean I like to stay active, then I have to agree with you.
Bloodstain on chair leg
Apollo:
Look, there's a bloodstain on one of the chair legs. 
Ema:
Really?! Hey, you're right. I completely missed that.
Apollo:
Let's move the chair so we can check under it. ...There's more blood under the chair leg.
Ema:
Hmm... I wonder what it's doing there. I have some luminol here. Why don't you do some testing around it?
Luminol
Spray floor
Leads to:
"Look! The bloodstain leads all the way to the sarcophagus!"
Apollo:
Look! The bloodstain leads all the way to the sarcophagus!
Athena:
Ema, is this Minister Inga's blood?
Ema:
Hold on one second... .........Huh? That's strange. I didn't get a match.
Apollo:
So then...whose blood is it? Dhurke and Ms. Fey weren't wounded as far as we know.
Athena:
And the blood's been wiped up by someone for some reason.
Apollo:
Yeah, that's strange, too.
Mysterious Bloodstain added to the Court Record.
Bloodstain on the floor (appears after examining bloodstain on chair)
Apollo:
There's a bloodstain on the floor.
Athena:
It's already been mostly wiped up, but the stain leads all the way to the sarcophagus. I wonder whose blood it is.
Rope
Athena:
I bet you didn't know, but I happen to be a bit of an escape artist myself. Trucy showed me how to do her rope escape trick.
Apollo:
Uh-huh. And why would you bother learning something like that?
Athena:
Because we're always getting into trouble when working cases with Mr. Wright. So I thought it might come in handy someday.
Apollo:
Well, I guess you're right about that. Ms. Fey could've definitely used that knowledge.
Athena:
That's right! So now, you just sit right here and we'll get started.
Apollo:
What in the world gave you the idea I wanted to learn?!
Wall curtains
Apollo:
Someone could have hid behind these curtains.
Athena:
Here, I'll go give it a try! Well, can you tell I'm hiding here?
Apollo:
No, I can't tell at all. That's it! That's the perfect hiding place!
Athena:
We did it, Apollo! We solved the case!
Ema:
Sorry to burst your bubble, but... ...the royal guard searched the tomb high and low right after they stormed in. And they said no one else was in here besides Minister Inga, Dhurke, and Ms. Fey.
Apollo:
...Well. Back to the drawing board, I guess.
Athena:
My brilliant deduction -- destroyed in three sentences.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Ema:
Your attorney's badge? Huh...
Apollo:
What, that normally gets a better reaction from you.
Ema:
I'm tired of collecting your fingerprints. It's kind of lost its luster.
Apollo:
Yeah, but who knows? There could be other people's prints on it.
Ema:
Ooh, that's true! Hand it over, buddy!
Apollo:
Ah!
Ema:
............Hmph. The only prints I found were yours.
Apollo:
(Argh, it's all dusty now.)
Anything else
Ema:
Oh, you must need my forensic expertise! Just leave it to me!
Apollo:
Oh, um... Actually, I was wondering if you see anything strange about this.
Ema:
...Oh. ....................................
Apollo:
(Why isn't she saying anything?)
After clearing all talk options:
Athena:
Poor Ms. Fey. I hope she gets better soon.
Apollo:
Ema, do you mind if we start looking around?
Ema:
Sure, I've already got the okay. Knock yourselves out. Oh, and here. It's a diagram the police drew of the tomb. I thought I'd give you a copy to help your investigation along.
Apollo:
Thank you.
Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record.
Ema:
Oh, and let me know if you need my forensic expertise. Don't you dare keep all the fun to yourselves, you hear?!
Apollo:
You don't need to worry about that. (Besides, I'd hardly classify this as "fun".)
After clearing all examination options:
Apollo:
I think we've covered just about everything. Maybe we should go over what we've learned so far.
Athena:
Umm... For starters, we're dealing with a locked-room murder. But instead of the tomb being locked, it was being cordoned off by the royal guard. And after the murder, no one was found to be hiding inside. 
Apollo:
Right. In addition... ...we also know that Dhurke's fingerprints are all over the murder weapon. 
Athena:
The curtain around the sarcophagus was drenched in the victim's blood on one side. The blood must've also gotten on the killer when they stabbed the minister from behind. 
Apollo:
Dhurke had blood on him when the crime was first discovered. Unfortunately, he doesn't remember what happened. 
Apollo:
..................
Athena:
............
Apollo:
(This is not good.)
Athena:
So, what we know so far is... ...things couldn't be worse for our case. And that's still and understatement somehow.
Apollo:
Yeah, it's looking pretty grim.
Ema:
Oh, uh! If you two are done here, I'll have to ask you to leave. Go on, scoot!
Apollo:
Something wrong, Ema? Why are you trying to give us the boot?
Ema:
...It's just easier if you're not here when His Ephemeral Holiness arrives. ...Ah!
Apollo:
(Speak of the devil.)
Ema:
P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... 
Nahyuta:
Detective Skye... It seems you've spoken at length with these two lawyers. I do hope you've also kept an eye on them.
Ema:
Y-Yes, of course! Like a hawk! They didn't touch a single thing! Ha, a-ha ha ha!
Nahyuta:
...Give a lawyer an inch, and they'll take a mile. Never forget that.
Apollo:
(There's that look of distrust again.) ...Hey, Nahyuta. Do you really believe that Dhurke's guilty?
Nahyuta:
.........
Apollo:
And are you seriously going to prosecute this case? I mean, he's your father. You were once part of the Defiant Dragons, weren't you?
Nahyuta:
.........
Apollo:
Hey! Nahyuta! Wait! I said wait! Come on, Athena, after him!
Athena:
Huh? ...Oh, uh, right behind you!
May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence
Apollo:
Nahyuta, would you stop already?!
Nahyuta:
.........What do you want?
Apollo:
It's about Dhurke. Would you please hear me out?
Nahyuta:
...I fail to see why I should. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Apollo:
Apollo:
Nahyuta! ...Are you afraid of what I might have to say? If not, there's no harm in listening, right?
Nahyuta:
.........Very well. Speak. But make it quick. There is much I must do.
Apollo:
(Why does everything have to be so difficult with you?)
Examine
Inga's residence
Apollo:
(Somebody got a little carried away decorating this place. There's a golden lion keeping watch at the entrance.) ...That frog looks like it's cowering under the lion's glare.
Athena:
Really? 'Cause to me, it looks like the frog is glaring at the lion.
Apollo:
Come on, Athena. How does that make any sense?
Athena:
Huh? I just call 'em as I see 'em.
Apollo:
(I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.)
Ga'ran's palace
Apollo:
The palace of Queen Ga'ran is built to impress. Its white walls and gold ornamentation lend it an imposing air.
Athena:
It makes Minister Inga's residence look downright humble by comparison.
Apollo:
Yeah. It shows the difference in their tastes... and which one wears the pants, so to speak
Amara's tomb
Apollo:
The previous queen, Amara, was laid to rest in her own private tomb. Pretty impressive.
Athena:
They say it cost $800 million to build, and took 400 workers five years to complete. Special memorial rites were also conducted at various points of its construction.
Apollo:
That's quite an undertaking.
Athena:
It was built with donations from her devoted subjects and royalty of neighboring countries. It ended up giving a huge boost to the national economy.
Apollo:
Wow, Queen Amara must've been one charismatic lady...
Rayfa's residence
Athena:
Ooh, look at those flowers! They give the whole house such a cute vibe! I wonder if this is where Princess Rayfa lives.
Apollo:
...I doubt it. She doesn't look like the type to decorate with cute flowers. I mean, I may not know her well, but she seems awfully serious and snobby. I bet she uses nothing but roses and peonies – stuffy old people flowers, you know?
Athena:
......Apollo. I guess it's too much to ask that you not judge a book by its cover, huh.
Apollo:
What's that supposed to mean?
Footprints
Apollo:
Are these... Inga's footprints? They appear to be heading toward the tomb.
Athena:
Didn't Princess Rayfa mention something about that? You know, something about him rushing over to the tomb before we arrived?
Apollo:
I wonder if he had accidentally dozed off before the exchange or something.
Landscape
Apollo:
Vibrant lotus flowers floating on still waters... Butterflies dancing about... It's almost supernatural in its beauty.
Athena:
And at the center of it all rises the tomb where Amara's soul slumbers.  It makes you wonder if that bridge there is a getaway to the hereafter.
Apollo:
Yeah... Especially after both Dhurke and Inga crossed that bridge earlier.
Urns
Apollo:
This overturned urn has spilled water everywhere. Everything around it is soaking wet.
Athena:
D-Don't look at me!
Apollo:
(Rightly or wrongly, I'm guessing Athena's the type who gets blamed for a lot of things. And the more people accuse her, the more defensive she becomes. Even to the point of preemptively denying any wrongdoing.)
Athena:
I said, it wasn't me!
Apollo:
I never said it was.
Talk
Prosecuting Dhurke
Apollo:
So, I know you'll be prosecuting Dhurke's case, but... ...aren't there any other prosecutors in this country? Why does it have to be you?
Nahyuta:
...Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, personally requested that I serve as prosecutor.
Apollo:
Sh-She did? That WOULD make it hard to say no.
Nahyuta:
Her Eminence thinks highly of my prosecution skills.
Apollo:
Still, she didn't have to ask you to handle a case against your own father. Be honest. You really don't want to do this, do you?
Nahyuta:
...Ahh. You speak of love and sentiment.
Apollo:
Er, I guess so.
Nahyuta:
I do not deny such human emotions. But... the law is the law. And placing personal feelings above it is beyond reprieve. ...Do you disagree?
Apollo:
W-Well... No, I don't disagree, but...
Nahyuta:
Civilizations only exist due to  the confines of the law. Without them, love and sentiment would lack the fertile they need to flourish. Do you disagree?"
Apollo:
No, but...
Nahyuta:
The law must be obeyed. This truth sits above all else, including personal feelings. Therefore, whether or not I am the son of the accused is of no consequence. It is that simple, or would you say otherwise?
Apollo:
Nnnngh... B-But...
Athena:
Come on, Apollo! Tell him how wrong he is!
Apollo:
B...But don't you... you know... wish it wasn't that way...?
Nahyuta:
...............
Athena:
.........
Nahyuta:
It appears I've wasted my breath on you.
Athena:
And the winner is... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi!
Nahyuta:
...Hmph. Still spewing empty words devoid of meaning or consequence, I see... ...you putrid red pepper.
Apollo:
Argh! ........ (I know I'm right... But did he have to be so eloquent about his point? It;s like he's trying to cover something up with his pretty words.)
Athena:
Apollo, I'd cut back on the debates with him if I were you. Just stick to questions, like the one you wanted to ask.
Who Dhurke cares about (appears after "Prosecuting Dhurke")
Apollo:
Nahyuta, I wanted to ask you about the hostage situation. Inga said he had someone dear to Dhurke in the palm of his hand. And he was using that person, along with his hostage, as leverage in obtaining the orb.
Nahyuta:
...! That's news to me.
Apollo:
Well, that's what Inga said.
Dhurke:
You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye.
Inga:
...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke.
Dhurke:
What?
Inga:
I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right?
Dhurke:
What?
Inga:
I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right?
Dhurke:
! ............
Inga:
Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way.
Apollo:
I got the impression Dhurke had no choice but to follow Inga's demands after he heard that. So who do you suppose this special person is?
Nahyuta:
.........I wouldn't know.
Apollo:
! (My bracelet's reacting!) Hey, Nahyuta, about what you just said--
Nahyuta:
Apollo:
Ack! Ow-ow-ouch! M-My bracelet is crushing my wrist! Youch! That really hurts! Wh-What the heck's going on?!
Nahyuta:
...I'm wise to your tricks, you putrid pepper. That bracelet reacts to the anxieties around you by squeezing your wrist. But now that I know how it works, I can make it tighten around your wrist any time I wish. Consider this a warning.
Apollo:
Argh... (I don't know how he did it, but this renders my bracelet useless.)
Nahyuta:
Such devilry is powerless in the face of the Holy Mother's blessings.
Athena:
Looks like your special power won't work against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, Apollo. We'll have to try something else.
Apollo:
Argh, you're right. We'll just have to ask Dhurke about this.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Nahyuta:
Why is that badge before me?
Apollo:
Remember how we used to talk about what we wanted to be back when we were kids? I wanted to be a lawyer, and you, a prosecutor. You said you wanted to prosecute bad guys to make sure they got punished.
Nahyuta:
Yes, passing judgment upon evil... That is my calling. And it is why I have taken this case.
Apollo:
Are you saying Dhurke is evil?
Nahyuta:
He who goes against what is righteous and holy... ...I shall reap his soul with all my power, whoever he may be, for that is my role.
Apollo:
(Then I'll just have to defend his soul with all MY power, Nahyuta.)
Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo
Nahyuta:
Alas... Another soul has departed this world, and must now be guided to the Twilight Realm.
Apollo:
You would even hold last rites for a kidnapper like Minister Inga?
Nahyuta:
Criminals, too, must be given funerary rites. Deny that, and their soul will turn malevolent, bringing woe upon the living. That is why all who pass on must receive a proper requiem.
Apollo:
Makes sense. I mean, if I were murdered, I'd probably be pretty keen on revenge, too.
Anything else
Nahyuta:
The putrid-minded lawyer seeks information from me? 
Apollo:
Come on, throw me a bone here.
Nahyuta:
I think not.
Apollo:
Well, aren't we stingy?
After clearing all Talk options and presenting Attorney's Badge:
Nahyuta:
.........It appears... 
Apollo:
?
Nahyuta:
...You intend to go through with a trial you have no hope of winning. Grow up, Mr. Justice. We are no longer children, you and I.
Apollo:
I'm not the one who needs to grow up, Nahyuta. In case you didn't hear, I won my last case against none other than Mr. Wright.
Nahyuta:
!
Athena:
You tell him, Apollo!
Nahyuta:
...............
Apollo:
(Is he mad? I can never tell with him.)
Nahyuta:
...This trial is different. Your foolishness will only earn you a death sentence for aiding and abetting a criminal. And those who die as criminals... ...are doomed to be reborn in the next life as something lower than a bug or vegetable. You would be lucky to return to this realm as a patch of mold.
Apollo:
M-Mold? That's pretty harsh.
Nahyuta:
If you wish to avert such a fate, abandon this folly before it is too late.
Apollo:
...I don't care if I end up as a dollop of blue cheese dressing in my next life! I'm going to defend Dhurke in court!
Nahyuta:
.........You fool. Know this... I intend to prosecute the accused with all my might -- no matter what you say or do. Consider yourself forewarned. ...Now, if you will excuse me.
Athena:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi knows his father will be publicly executed if he's found guilty. Yet he won't show even an ounce of mercy.
Apollo:
............... (...Nahyuta. Is this the real you? Have you really changed? Do you really plan on sending Dhurke to his death? Do you even hear me? Don't Dhurke and I matter to you anymore?)
To Be Continued
May 18Tem'phul Temple
Phoenix:
(Maya passed out right after we found her in the tomb.)
Maya:
...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open...
Phoenix:
(She's been out cold ever since. We haven't been able to get a word out of her. The doctor says it's just exhaustion, but I can't help but worry...)
Edgeworth:
What is it, Wright? Are you all right?
Phoenix:
...Yeah. Just thinking is all. I'm glad you're here, Edgeworth. We wouldn't have gotten the permissions we have without you.
Edgeworth:
...Well, I didn't come all the way to Khura'in to be useless. Speaking of the investigation, I received a few things from Detective Skye. These should prove to be useful to us as well.
Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record.
Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
I can't thank you enough, Edgeworth. (Honestly, I'd have been so lost without him these past few days.)
???:
You there! The "Barbed Head" lawyer, Phoenix Wriiiiiight!
Phoenix:
Huh? .........You're... from the Ga'ran Royal Guard, right...?
Royal Guard:
I am Lah'kee, royal guard member and Her Eminence's shoooooulder rubber!!!
Phoenix:
That's... very specific... And what does the royal shoulder rubber want with me? Wait, come to think of it, my shoulders ARE a bit stiff--
Royal Guard:
Don't be absuuurd!!! I am here for one purpose ooonly!!! I am to bring you before Her Eminence... ...Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in!! Will you complyyy?!!!
Phoenix:
The queen? What could she want with me? (And why does he have to shout like that&#160;?)
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I can't fathom why Queen Ga'ran would summon you... ...but I advise you to accept Her Eminence's gracious invitation. .........Royal shoulder rubber Lahkee, was it? May I join Mr. Wright in his audience with the queen?
Royal Guard:
The name's Lah'kee! L-A-H apostrophe K-E-E!!! And...! All praise the omnipotent Queen Ga'raaan!!! For she has already foreseen and approved your request, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth!!! You are both to come with meeeee!!!
Edgeworth:
You mean to say that Queen Ga'ran sees our every move?
Royal Guard:
Yes indeeeed! Her Eminence's spiritual power is immeeeeeeense!!! She can even see what's going on thoooousands of miiiiiiiiles away!!!
Edgeworth:
.........Wright. I fear I'll lose my hearing next if we don't hurry.
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah... Me, too... Why would the queen herself summon me personally? What could she possibly be up to?
Examine
Temple
Phoenix:
There weren't any hotels available, so this is our home for tonight. It's a bed to sleep in and a roof over our heads.
Phoenix:
Sorry to disappoint, but... there aren't any beds here. We'll have to sleep on the floor next to a bunch of strangers.
Edgeworth:
Wh-What? ...Tell me there's a shower at the very least.
Phoenix:
The kitchen sink works just fine, I hear.
Edgeworth:
Of all the-- Wright, you will work to bring this case to a swift resolution. The sooner the better.
Edgeworth:
.........I suppose it will do.
Spring
Phoenix:
The water's so clear, it's like a window into the soul.
Edgeworth:
I wouldn't stare too hard into it, Wright. Or you may find all your bluffs staring right back at you.
Phoenix:
No pool-gazing in front of a client. Got it.
Background Temples
Edgeworth:
There appears to be many temples in this area.
Phoenix:
Yeah, there are always a lot of monks and worshippers praying around here. And then there's tourists like us.
Edgeworth:
It's unfortunate that we have more pressing matters to attend to. Then again, sightseeing with you of all people isn't exactly at the top of my list.
Phoenix:
(As if you have the luxury to be so picky, Edgeworth.)
Talk
Any Ideas?
Edgeworth:
So you'd been here all this time. I wondered where you had gone.
Phoenix:
...Don't tell me you missed me, Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
As if. The courts have been so peaceful without you around.
Phoenix:
You make it sound like I leave legal devastation in my wake.
Edgeworth:
Heh... Well, don't you?
What to do
Edgeworth:
Well, Wright, what do you intend to do now?
Phoenix:
I was thinking... I want to help Apollo win this case. So why don't we try to gather whatever information we can?
Edgeworth:
You're quite the considerate boss.
Phoenix:
Well, I kinda forced him to take care of the office in my absence, so... ...it's the least I can do.
Present
Attorney's Badge or Tomb Diagram
Edgeworth:
Still at it, I see. I guess borders mean little in the face of your incurable habit.
Phoenix:
Well, I heard you used to present evidence left and right during your investigations, too.
Edgeworth:
That was a long time ago. ...Besides, who did you hear that from?
Phoenix:
Oh, I have my sources.
Edgeworth:
Oh? Well, tell your "source" that I look forward to his next salary review.
Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo
Edgeworth:
It's ironic that the man tasked with upholding the law should end up breaking it.
Phoenix:
Well, it's not like we don't have our fair share of that back home.
Edgeworth:
Hmph, that is a thing of the past. The worst offenders have already been removed.
Phoenix:
Now that you mention it, wasn't Gaspen Payne expelled from the prosecutor's office?
Edgeworth:
Yes, he was a particularly troublesome individual. I was shocked to see him resurface here in Khura'in, and with considerable sway, no less. I just hope he doesn't end up making a mess of things here as well.

Audience Chamber
Leads to:
May 18, 2:45 PM
Ga'ran Palace – Royal Residence
Royal Residence
Investigate
Ga'ran Palace
Phoenix:
Ga'ran Palace, the heart of the kingdom's government and religion.
Edgeworth:
Yes, the two are inseparably intertwined here in Khura'in. The religious beliefs of its people touch every aspect of their lives, including legal affairs.
Phoenix:
Right. Like how they commune with spirits in court. I suppose Khura'inism is the glue that binds their faith, law, and politics together. It may seem strange to foreigners like us, but for them, it's perfectly natural.
Landscape
Phoenix:
What a beautiful place this is. But I'd be enjoying this a whole lot more if we weren't investigating a murder.
Edgeworth:
Commoners aren't normally allowed access to the royal residence, you know. Under ordinary circumstances, it would be impossible to take in such a spectacular view. Though murder is certainly a unique reason to be offered such a rare opportunity.
perfectly natural.
Rayfa's Residence
Phoenix:
This place is decorated with all sorts of colorful flowers. And that view from the veranda looks like it would be amazing. If I had to guess, I'd say Rayfa must live here.
Amara's Tomb
Phoenix:
Amara's Tomb -- the scene of Inga's murder. Poor Maya was held captive in there.
Edgeworth:
To think she was actually being held here in Khura'in. If only we had found out sooner.
Phoenix:
...No point dwelling on that now. All we can do is to keep moving forward. 
Edgeworth:
Yes, of course.
Footprints
Edgeworth:
There are footprints coming from this residence.
Phoenix:
Too bad they just kinda end. I wonder who made them and where they went.
Urns
Phoenix:
This overturned urn spilled its water all over the place. It was already knocked over when we got here earlier this afternoon, so... ...we can rule out Athena at least.
Edgeworth:
.........Wright. What does it say about you if your first suspect is your own subordinate?
Inga's Residence
Phoenix:
...What a gaudy building. Looks like something you'd appreciate, Edgworth.
Edgeworth:
...For the record, Wright, I have absolutely no interest in such ostentatious things.
Phoenix:
(Says the man who rides around in a red sports car, wearing that frilly cravat thing.)
Amara's tomb
Investigate
Anything
Phoenix:
Apollo and Athena are already working this area. Edgeworth and I should try someplace else.
Detention Center
Investigate
Bell
Edgeworth:
This bell must be for summoning the guard.
Phoenix:
I bet one of your detectives would come running if you rang it.
Edgeworth:
Let's find out, shall we?
Phoenix:
Th-They're not seriously going to show up, are they?
Guard
Phoenix:
Oh, the guard's asleep. And here I thought he was stoically doing his duty. Impressive.
May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber
Ga'ran:
Ah, the "Barbed Head" lawyer has arrived. We bid you welcome. And you, as well, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
Th-Thank you. (This place is still as magnificent as last time.)
Ga'ran:
We have heard much about you, Barbed One. It seems your bluffs and tomfoolery tend to leave our court devastated in their wake.
Phoenix:
Uh... Is that what people have been saying about me?
Edgworth:
...Wright! Where are your manners?! Your Eminence. I am both humbled and delighted to be in your presence.
Phoenix:
Oh, umm... Your Eminence... Um, glad to be here. Looks like you're doing well.
Ga'ran:
...Heh. It is all right. There is no need to keep your head bowed all day.
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Eminence.
Rayfa:
...............
Phoenix:
(Rayfa's not looking too good. I guess even she can't just bounce back from her father's murder...) ...So what can I do for you, Your Eminence?
Ga'ran:&lt;br.
We wish to question you about something related to the case at hand.
Phoenix:
(Perfect. Because I have a few questions of my own.)
Examine
Throne
Phoenix:
That's one swanky throne. I wouldn't mind taking a seat there myself.
Edgeworth:
The jester and the crown. I imagine it'd make quite the interesting picture.
Phoenix:
You know Edgeworth... I hate to say this, but you're absolutely right.
Guards
Phoenix:
It's the Ga'ran Royal Guard. The one who came for us earlier said that he's the royal shoulder rubber. ...Um, excuse me. But are each of you charged with your own specific task?
Royal Guard:
I'm the royal teeeeeaaaa server!
Royal Guard:
I'm the royal taaaaaaster!
Royal Guard:
I'm the royal bed maaaaaaaker!
Royal Guard:
I'm the royal fitness traaaaiiiiine--
Phoenix:
All right, all right... I'm sorry I asked.
Edgeworth:
At this rate, one has to wonder if there is no task left unassigned by Her Eminence.
Talk
Inga's crime
Ga'ran:
We fear we do not fully comprehend what has transpired. So it is that we summoned you here to further elucidate the situation. Is it true that our husband Inga had been seeking the Founder's Orb?
Phoenix:
That's right. He wanted to trade a hostage for it. That's why he abducted Maya Fey.
Rayfa:
Insolent fool!
*ka-tonk!*
Phoenix:
Oww!
Rayfa:
That is a lie! A lie, I say! Father would have never done such a thing!
Phoenix:
B-But he did abduct Maya. That much is--
Rayfa:
I will not stand here and listen to this nonsense! You will pay for this, you... you...!
*ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!*
Phoenix:
Ow-Ow-Oww! P-Please, Your Benevolence!
Ga'ran:
That is quite enough, Rayfa. We understand your feelings, but we fear he speaks the truth. For we believe we know why your father would do such a thing.
Rayfa:
Huh?
Ga'ran:
We believe he was seeking the orb as a means of obtaining spiritual power. And with it, he intended to usurp the throne.
Rayfa:
.........M-Mother...
Phoenix:
What do you mean, Your Eminence?
Ga'ran:
Inga was planning a coup, for he was dissatisfied with the current administration... ...and his secret police was the primary instrument of his treason.
Phoenix:
The secret police... They came up during the high priest's murder trial, too. An elite force under the direct command of the Minister of Justice -- in this case, Inga. The man who was hunting down rebels as Lady Kee'ra was a member of that group.
Ga'ran:
Indeed. Inga turned that once proud force into his own private army. And he intended on using them to launch a coup and assassinate us.
Edgeworth:
So Your Eminence had no control over them?
Ga'ran:
As much as it shames us to admit it, Khura'in is not the unified realm it would appear to be. We are truly sorry you have had to witness the dirty underbelly of our kingdom.
Rayfa:
H...How could Father...?
Ga'ran:
But know that Inga could not have become king simply through our assassination. For in Khura'in, only those who possess spiritual power may sit on the throne.
Edgeworth:
I see... That explains why Minister Inga was seeking the Founder's Orb.
Ga'ran:
Barbed One, do you recall the man known as Pees'lubn Andistan'dhin?
Phoenix:
...What about him?
Ga'ran:
He, too, was involved in Inga's machinations. Inga had bought his loyalty, ordered the man to steal the orb, and covered up the theft.
Phoenix:
And then, he sent the orb to the U.S. for Dr. Buff to study... It's all coming together...
Dhurke the criminal
Ga'ran:
The capture of the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi... It may prove to be the crowning achievement of our reign. Now, perhaps, the kingdom may return to the peace it once knew. Oh, what a joyous day.
Royal Guard:
Hail to Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, Grand Priestess of Khura'in! Her Eminence's spiritual power invoked a blessing straight from the Holy Mother!
Phoenix:
(I could see how her cronies would be elated at the prospect. But the queen herself seems almost giddy for someone whose husband was just murdered.)
Rayfa:
Father...
Phoenix:
(Rayfa, on the other hand, doesn't appear to be taking it so well.) About that incident that occurred twenty-three years ago... The one in which Dhurke was accused of assassinating Queen Amara.
Ga'ran:
Yes, he set fire to her private residence, burning my dear sister alive.
Phoenix:
Murder by arson...
Ga'ran:
ONly a demon would be capable of such a heinous crime.
Phoenix:
(But that event also set the stage for you to become queen...) What did you do before you were crowned queen, Your Eminence?
Ga'ran:
As part of our training to be queen, we served in many different governmental positions. The longest of which was as the previous Minister of Justice. It was in that position that we were best able to support our elder sister, Queen Amara.
Phoenix:
(Interesting... That's her husband's position, or at least it was.) And when you ascended to the throne, you passed the Defense Culpability Act.
Defense Culpability Act (appears after "Dhurke the criminal")
Phoenix:
"...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty." What prompted you to pass something like the Defense Culpability Act, Your Eminence?
Ga'ran:
...The assassination of our dear sister Amara. When the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi was apprehended... ...he announced that he would act as his own lawyer.
Phoenix:
(That's right... Dhurke used to be a lawyer.)
Ga'ran:
Dhurke had been an extraordinarily talented lawyer, and highly esteemed by the people. But he falsified evidence in an attempt to win his own case.
Phoenix:
I see...
Ga'ran:
But when the truth of his fabrications and the assassination of the queen came to light... ...the people were devastated. And trust in the legal system plummeted.
Edgeworth:
.........Now why does that sound so familiar?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I wonder, aha-hah-hah...
Ga'ran:
In Khura'in, the Hall of Justice is a sacred space where victims receive their last rites. Should the people lose their faith in it, the kingdom would be shaken to its very core. That is why the Defense Culpability Act had to be passed. It was the only way to keep our legal system from tumbling into the abyss.
Phoenix:
So that's how you sought to eliminate the use of perjury and phony evidence, huh. But that law is what made lawyers go extinct in your kingdom. Now there's no one left to defend those who have been accused.
Ga'ran:
.........We see how you could take issue with such a reality. However, we have not banned the act of lawyering itself. Those who are confident that they can prove their client's innocence... ...are always welcome to mount a vigorous defense, as you yourself have shown.
Phoenix:
W-Well, I guess so, but... Without lawyers, there's the possibility of false charges being filed and prosecuted.
Ga'ran:
So long as our prosecutors continue to run nothing but perfect trials... ...there needn't be fear of such nefarious dealings. Do you disagree?
Phoenix:
(Perfect prosecutors and their perfect trials, huh...)
Edgeworth:
Let's not get started down THIS path...
Ga'ran:
Furthermore, here in Khura'in, we have the Divination Séance. And so it is we no longer need lawyers, for the dead do not lie.
Phoenix:
Well, in the short time I've been here, I've beaten back false charges twice. And I've found that cases built on the memories of the dead are less than perfect. So yes, I do take issue with the Defense Culpability Act, to say the least.
Ga'ran:
...Ho ho ho. Such relentless rhetoric. Your reputation precedes you, Barbed One. It feels as if we ourselves were being cross-examined.
Phoenix:
O-Oh, no, that wasn't my intention.
Ga'ran:
...It is true that some feel that the Defense Culpability Act is a necessary evil at best. But it is a small sacrifice upon which the peace of our kingdom has been forged.
Phoenix:
(If you consider executing innocent lawyers a small sacrifice, then sure.)
Ga'ran:
The fact is that following its passage... ...the crime rate here in Khura'in dropped markedly. Therefore, we have no regrets concerning the enactment of the Defense Culpability Act.
Phoenix:
(Really? None at all?)
Edgeworth:
Wright, why don't we leave it at that? This isn't a court of law, after all.
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah...
Ga'ran:
About the Founder's Orb that was to be exchanged for the hostage... It went missing after the murder. Would you happen to know anything about that?
Phoenix:
It's missing? I'm sure Dhurke had it when he went into the tomb. If it wasn't there, I have no idea where it could be, Your Eminence.
Ga'ran:
...In that case, then perhaps Dhurke has hidden it somewhere. ...Incidentally... there is the matter of that horned youth you were with.
Phoenix:
Oh, you must mean Apollo.
Ga'ran:
From his odd hairstyle, may we assume him to be a relative? Perhaps, your younger brother?
Phoenix:
N-No, no! You've got it all wrong. He's Dhurke's son. Well, more like foster son -- they're not actually related by blood.
Ga'ran:
Dhurke's...? .........Royal guard!
Royal Guard:
Your Eminence!
Phoenix:
Hm? (What's she whispering in that one guy's ear?)
Ga'ran:
.........Thank you for your time. The two of you may go now.
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Eminence. We'll be on our way.
Phoenix:
(Okay, now what? Apollo and Athena have the murder scene investigation covered, so... ...maybe we should go speak with the locals over at the bazaar.)
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
Um, please take a look at this...
Ga'ran:
...That reminds us of when Dhurke was still practicing law. So, we see that lawyers in your country also present evidence... ...simply to gauge the other party's reaction when all else has failed. Do not presume to use such simplistic methods upon us.
Phoenix:
S-Sorry.
May 18Khura'in - Bazaar
RAWWWRRR!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What... Was that a lion?
Phoenix:
Oh, that? Caught me by surprise, too, when I first heard it. It's the cry of a local bird known as a warbaa'd.
Edgeworth:
A bird? That sounds like that?
Warbaa'd:
RAWWWRRR!
Edgeworth:
Sounds more like a beast than a bird, if you ask me.
Phoenix:
It's a form of mimicry. You know, to help protect them against predators and stuff.
Edgeworth:
Yes, well... Can't say I've heard one quite like that before.
Phoenix:
Oh, it's more than unusual -- it's endangered. It's extremely rare to encounter one in the wild these days.
Edgeworth:
...If it's so rare, then what's one doing out here in the middle of the bazaar?
Phoenix:
You got me. Maybe it's got something to do with it being their national bird.
*BANG*
Phoenix:
Aaahh! (Was that a gunshot?!)
???:
Har har har har har! Startle ya, PW?
Phoenix:
Wh-What was that, Datz?!
Datz:
The Defiant Dragons' newest weapon. I call these puppies... Dragon Snot Snaps!
Phoenix:
Uh, huh... And you need those... why?
Datz:
Because our hard work is starting to pay off! Thanks to our TV signal hijacking and stuff, more and more people are joining our cause. But on account o' that, the regime's been cracking down on us real tough-like.
Phoenix:
Yeah, there's been a lot going on lately.
Datz:
You can say that again. I mean, what with the high priest's fake-murder-slash-suicide. People are calling the "DCA Tragedy," and it's causing a real public uproar.
Phoenix:
(Hopefully this means Tahrust's death won't be in vain after all.) ...So how exactly is a handful of firecrackers going to be of help to you guys anyway?
Datz:
Simple. First, I supply 'em to our fellow rebels. Then we use 'em as a diversion when we need to shake Ga'ran's goons.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Datz:
Like this!
*BANG!*
Phoenix:
Whoa! W-Will you cut that out?! I'm not with the regime, and I'm not chasing you!
Datz:
Har har har har har har! Haaaar har har har har! Your reaction! That was priceless, PW!
Warbaa'd:
RAWWWRRR!
Datz:
Har har har har har har! Guess I startled that warbaa'd, too!
Phoenix:
(It's a miracle no one's trying to arrest him while he's too busy laughing.)
???:
You there.
Datz:
!
Rayfa:
You are one of those insurgents, are you not?
Datz:
Yikes! ...Take that!
*BANG!*
Rayfa:
Eek!
Phoenix:
Aaand he's gone. Those firecrackers are more useful than I thought.
Rayfa:
Barbed Head!
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence. What can I do for you?
Rayfa:
I... I wanted to speak with you. .........About what my mother said... I do not believe a word of it. My father could not have been planning a coup.
Phoenix:
Well, I can understand why you'd feel like that, but...
Rayfa:
It was a setup! Someone must have been plotting against him.
Phoenix:
Um, and how do you know that?
Rayfa:
I just do. Because the Holy Mother guides me. And as the royal priestess, I must uncover the truth for all to see.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Maybe this is just how Rayfa expresses her sense of duty.)
Rayfa:
You're investigating this matter, are you not? Then rejoice, for I shall accompany you, and bestow upon you the royal priestess's wisdom.
Phoenix:
Ha, a-ha ha. That's the best news I've heard all day, Your Benevolence. (No one would dare get in our way with Rayfa by our side.) We humbly accept your offer, don't we, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
As you wish, Wright.
Rayfa:
Excellent. Then let us begin with my father's private quarters. We should be able to find some clues there. I shall expose this false charge for what it is, if it is the last thing I do!
Phoenix:
(Could it be? Is the reason she's so defensive about Inga because she's a daddy's girl?)
Rayfa:
Barbed Head! Let us not waste any time! My father's private quarters are located within the royal residence. Now, follow me!
Phoenix:
Wait! She's sure in a hurry.
Edgeworth:
Wright, the minister's private quarters may hold evidence related to his murder as well.
Phoenix:
Yeah, maybe we can kill two birds with one stone. (Rayfa's awfully fired up. I just hope she'll be ready for the truth we find. After all, it's hard to believe that Inga was not in full control of the whole affair.)
Examine
Anything
Edgeworth:
I never thought the day would come when we'd be investigating a case side by side.
Phoenix:
Oh? 'Cause I never thought the day would come when you'd get sentimental on me.
Edgeworth:
Nghrk! Come on, Wright! Time's a wasting!
Phoenix:
Wait, exactly which one of us was wasting time here?
May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence
Phoenix:
Now, if we could figure out which of these buildings houses Inga's private quarters... That's where we'll find Rayfa.
Investigate
Inga's Residence
Phoenix:
Now that's what I call and extravagant exterior. Is this where Inga's private quarters are?
Edgeworth:
Watch your step, Wright. That urn's been knocked over, spilling water everywhere.
Phoenix:
Yeah, the ground's soaked. I wonder who did this?
???:
.........*sob*
Phoenix:
Hm? ...I think someone's in there.
???:
*sob* Father... *sniffle*
Phoenix:
Is that... Princess Rayfa?
Rayfa:
There were still so many things I wished to tell you...
Phoenix:
(...She always puts on such a brave face.) (But hearing her crying all alone... I...) (I can't help but think of Trucy.)
Rayfa:
*sob* Father... ...............
Phoenix:
...Um, Princess Rayfa? Are you in there?
Rayfa:
Ah! J-Just a moment! I'll be right out! .........I see you are finally here. Well, let us commence our investigation, shall we?
Phoenix:
...Um, Your Benevolence? Maybe you should rest for a minute first.
Rayfa:
...! You were eavesdropping on me! Weren't you?!
Phoenix:
Um, no! I mean, yes... Sorry. I couldn't help overhearing...
Rayfa:
.........Grrrr.
Phoenix:
I-It wasn't like I was spying on you or anything!
Rayfa:
...You stupid... stupid... Barbed Head!
*ka-tonk!*
Phoenix:
Yeowch!
Edgeworth:
...You could've feigned ignorance. It's as if your brain-to-mouth filter shuts off the moment you step out of the courtroom.
Phoenix:
Ugh... I'm not THAT bad, Edgeworth.
Rayfa:
...Anyway, what took you so long? I thought you would never get here. You have a lot of nerve, keeping the crown princess waiting.
Phoenix:
Oh, um... sorry?
Rayfa:
This was my father's residence. I have already unlocked it, so you can go right in. Oh, and... Be careful. Some dingbat dog in the courtyard and spilled water over there.
Phoenix:
A dingbat dog?
Rayfa:
That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth.
Phoenix:
I wonder how it got into this area. Do you know what it looked like?
Rayfa:
Hmph. I have better things to do than to memorize what some stray dog looks like. Anyway, it is not worth talking about. Let's search my father's room, shall we?
Phoenix:
(...I really hope she's all right.)
Inga's Residence (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
The Minister of Justice used to live here.
Phoenix:
Yeah, the decor looks like something he'd choose.
May 18
Ga'ran Palace - Inga's Private Quarters
Phoenix:
(What a mess. You can definitely tell a guy used to live in this room. I guess Inga and I had at least that much in common.)
Rayfa:
...Bah, this staff keeps getting in the way. Nayna! .................. ...Oh.
Phoenix:
(Huh? Where's Nayna? Normally... ...she comes running whenever Rayfa calls.)
Rayfa:
...That's right. Nayna is...
Phoenix:
(Nayna is... what?)
Rayfa:
Oh, well. You, Barbed Head! Come, hold this staff for me.
Phoenix:
Wh-Why me?
Rayfa:
Just take it! It's too heavy, and I am tired of holding it!
Phoenix:
(*sigh How does Nayna put up with this day in and day out?) Um... I'll just set it over here for now.
Examine
Footprints
Phoenix:
There are some muddy shoeprints here. (Come to think of it... There was some spilled water by the entrance. Somebody must've stepped in it before coming in here.)
Edgeworth:
They're already dry. That means they're at least several hours old.
Rayfa:
Then someone must have been in here today in the early afternoon... ...for our servants clean this room each day. Here in Khura'in we have a saying: "Leave not today's untidiness to the morrow."
Phoenix:
(Mine is: "Why clean up today what you can leave for tomorrow?")
Hair dye
Phoenix:
What's this? ..."Je suis L'Belle!"? Never thought I'd see THIS brand again...
Edgeworth:
It appears to be a sample of some sort of spray-on hair color.
Phoenix:
"Color: Jet Black"... I wonder if Inga was going grey. Here, Edgeworth. Maybe you can use it.
Edgeworth:
I like my natural hair color just fine, thank you very much!
Desk
Phoenix:
His desk is crammed full of documents!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... They appear to be paperwork for executions.
Phoenix:
B-But for this many cases?!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Something is rotten in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Hm? This one dates back to five years ago.
Phoenix:
Something tells me he simply kept putting them off because he hated doing paperwork.
Bed
Phoenix:
That's one luxurious and comfy-looking bed. I've slept on nothing but hard floors since coming to Khura'in. Can't wait to sleep in a nice, soft bed again.
Rayfa:
Then take it. It's yours, if you wish. ......We'll have to clean this room out, anyway, now that my father's gone.
Phoenix:
But don't you want to keep these things as a memento of your father? Besides... I don't need his spirit haunting me late at night.
Rayfa:
.........Do you suppose if I slept on it, I could see my father once more?
Phoenix:
P-Princess Rayfa... (I honestly don't know how to answer that...)
Bust
Phoenix:
Wow... That's one gaudy sculpture.
Rayfa:
My father sculpted it himself from a block of solid gold.
Phoenix:
(Why does it not surprise me that he was also a narcissist?) Ha ha ha. It's pretty detailed. He even included that personal stamp of his. Hey, the stamp's a little loose. Ah!
Edgeworth:
Look. There's a secret safe inside!
Rayfa:
Oh, my! To think such a thing was here all this time!
Phoenix:
Rats. Looks like we'll need the combination to get in.
Bust (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
To have a secret safe in his own bedroom... It seems the minister was a rather cagey man.
Phoenix:
Let's take a look inside. Who knows what we might find.
Safe (after examining bust)
Phoenix:
We can't open this without the combination, but I doubt Princess Rayfa would know it...
Edgeworth:
Well, if we can't open it, we can't open it. For now, let's continue our investigation, and come back to this dilemma later.
Syringe
Phoenix:
It's a syringe and a vial...
Rayfa:
Those were for my father's back pain. He said it really helped when the pain was particularly unbearable.
Phoenix:
It was that bad, huh.
Edgeworth:
He must've been injecting some sort of painkiller directly into his back, then.
Rayfa:
Yes, my father said his back pain could knock him off his feet.
Phoenix:
I know the feeling. I've experienced some pretty severe back pain of my own...
Rayfa:
Well, we can't have you throwing your back out in court, so why don't you take a vial?
Phoenix:
Oh, uh, no thanks. I hear your body builds up a tolerance to that sort of thing.
Painkiller Shots ninja'd into pocket.
Rayfa:
I thought you didn't want them.
Phoenix:
(I'm going straight to a chiropractor as soon as I get home.)
Notepad
Phoenix:
This notepad must've belonged to Inga. Let's see... That's strange.
Edgeworth:
These appear to be notes detailing people's most prominent characteristics.
Phoenix:
Hey, there's even some stuff about me in here. Why would he bother doing this?
Rayfa:
Hmm... I am afraid even I can't answer that.
Phoenix:
(Whatever the reason, it's giving me a case of the heebie-jeebies.)
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It's as though he was taking down descriptions of people over the phone... That's what it reminds me of, anyway.
Rayfa:
What a brilliant deduction! One fitting of a chief prosecutor such as yourself. I commend you.
Edgeworth:
...Heh, that's high praise coming from you, Your Benevolence.
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth's right. They do look like dictation notes, but... I don't know... I mean, why bother describing Nayna, who he must've seen every day?)
Inga's Notepad added to the Court Record.
Notepad (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
It's the notepad with those descriptions of various people in it. I wonder what Inga was using it for.
Talk
The kidnapping
Rayfa:
Barbed Head... I, the Royal Priestess of Khura'in, shall share my thoughts on the abduction.
Phoenix:
You will?
Rayfa:
......Listen carefully, for such opportunities do not come often.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, of course. We'd be grateful to hear anything you'd like to share.
Rayfa:
...My father was very likely seeking to obtain the Founder's Orb.
Rayfa:
But it was not for the purposes of a coup d'état. It was all... for my sake!
Phoenix:
For your sake? 
Rayfa:
The Founder's Orb is capable of bestowing great spiritual power. My father truly believed that. And he wanted that power to be mine. I haven't finished my training, and I still can't channel spiritsQ! He was doing it for me! 
Phoenix:
......Right, I see.
Rayfa:
Well? Do you understand why he did it now?
Phoenix:
............I do, but... ...it doesn't change the fact that Minister Inga was a kidnapper.
Rayfa:
Ah! 
Phoenix:
But I guess you don't believe he is, do you?
Rayfa:
Ooooooh! New information is sure to surface upon further investigation. S-Suffice to say , he did this all for me. End of story!
Phoenix:
(Was he really trying to obtain the orb for Rayfa? Somehow, I doubt it. Speaking of powers... ...I wonder if Rayfa will be performing the Divination Séance tomorrow. I should probably ask her about that.
Nayna
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence, I noticed Nayna isn't with you today.
Rayfa:
.........I know not where she has gone. I have not spoken with her since this morning. I assume she must be quite busy today. I did catch a glimpse of her a little after two o'clock. I tried calling out to her... ...but she went off somewhere again.
Phoenix:
A little after two? That's about an hour before the murder.
Rayfa:
...Indeed. Of all the times for this to happen... She normally comes to me the moment I call her name.
Phoenix:
(I know it's hard to believe, but even nannies have lives, you know...)
Edgeworth:
Your inability to find her after the murder is slightly alarming. I wonder if her absence is related to today's incidents somehow.
Rayfa:
Do you think she was unwittingly caught up in them?
Phoenix:
Who knows... At the very least I don't think she was at the scene of the crime.
Rayfa:
Nayna... I hope she is all right.
Phoenix:
(Rayfa seems really worried for Nayna.)
Tomorrow's Séance (appears after "The kidnapping")
Phoenix:
I take it you'll be conducting tomorrow's Divination Séance?
Rayfa:
Who else, if not I?
Phoenix:
Good point. (The thing is... ...Divination Séances are all about what victims experienced in their final moments. So, tomorrow... ...Rayfa will experience her own father's death, exactly as it happened. That's more than anyone should ever have to deal with.) ...Do you really have to go through with the Séance tomorrow? There's really no one else? What about just calling the whole thing off?
Rayfa:
............It's not as if... ...It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to.
Phoenix:
No?
Rayfa:
Ah! N-Never mind. I misspoke! The Divination Séance is a very important duty of the Royal Priestess. And it is one I intend to fulfill.
Phoenix:
(There's that word: duty)
Maya:
...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein.
Rayfa:
.................. I wonder if I am even up to the task.
Phoenix:
(Performing the Divination Séance IS very important for a priestess... ...but duty or not, it's a heavy burden for someone so young. Even worse, she'll be forced to watch her father's murder. Will it be a weight too heavy for her to bear?)
Nayna and Rayfa (appears after "Nayna")
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence, has Nayna served you long?
Rayfa:
Yes, she has been at my beck and call for as long as I can remember. I have heard she even cared for me as an infant, right down to changing my diapers.
Phoenix:
Your diapers? It almost sounds like she could be your mother.
Rayfa:
Indeed. But that is a simple fact of life when your mother is busy being queen. Nayna takes care of my every need. She is my teacher in all things, as well.
Phoenix:
(Rayfa's pool of knowledge seems rather lopsided in some respects. Could that be the result of Nayna's teachings?)
Rayfa:
Nayna... Could it be that my trusted attendant has come to dislike me? Now that I think about it, perhaps I've been acting rather spoiled as of late.
Phoenix:
Oh, I'm sure she'll be back.
Rayfa:
...Yes, I suppose Nayna would never truly abandon me. Upon her return, I will do something nice for her. Perhaps she'd like a shoulder massage.
Phoenix:
(And yet, I can't shake the feeling that Nayna's connected to this case in some way.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Rayfa:
Remove that vile badge from my sight! If you insist on tormenting me, I will take matters into my own hands!
Phoenix:
Hey, don't bite it!
Rayfa:
............ Hmm, it's much harder than I thought.
Phoenix:
...What did you think it's made of?
Tomb Crime Photo
Rayfa:
...! ............
Phoenix:
Um, Your Benevolence?
Rayfa:
.........Father.
Phoenix:
Whoops, s-sorry! Didn't mean to hurt you like that.
Rayfa:
Hmph! Do not underestimate me! I am the royal priestess, and as such I will experience my father's death tomorrow. So hand it over! A photo of a corpse... will not... phase...
Phoenix:
You Benevolence!
Edgeworth:
Wright, you fool! Put that picture away!
Rayfa:
...Nngh. There is no need to worry. I simply lost my footing, that's all.
Phoenix:
(Now I'm REALLY worried about tomorrow.)
Painkiller Shots
Rayfa:
My father's back used to cause him considerable pain. I would give him massages from time to time. He seemed to truly enjoy them.
Phoenix:
Hmm, I didn't peg you as the dutiful daughter type.
Rayfa:
But never again... will I...
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence... Um... I could stand in for your father if you'd like--
Rayfa:
............Rrgh!
*WHAM*
Phoenix:
Youch! M-My back! I think you broke something!
Rayfa:
Hmph. That's what I call the royal treatment.
Inga's Notepad
Rayfa:
These are notes my father took on the characteristics of those around him. I wonder what he wrote about me.
Phoenix:
Let's see... Pink raiment... Tattoos on face... Ch-Childishly cute?!
Rayfa:
Huh?!
Phoenix:
That last one's rather subjective, isn't it...
Anything else
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence, I wanted to ask you about this.
Rayfa:
Nayna! Nayna! Where are you?!
Phoenix:
Um, I thought you said she wasn't around...
Rayfa:
...Oh, yes, of course......... Well, you're sadly mistaken if you think questioning Nayna will clear things up.
Phoenix:
(But I'm trying to question you, not Nayna.)
Move
Rayfa:
Barbed Head. First you make me wait, and now you're simply going to leave?!
Phoenix:
(Guess I should stay put for a while.)
After clearing all Talk options and examining footprints, desk, bust, syringe, and notepad:
Phoenix:
I'm really beginning to wonder what's inside that safe. Any idea what the combination might be, Your Benevolence?
Rayfa:
None whatsoever.
Phoenix:
(It looks like a four-digit combo lock, so maybe it's a date. But it's probably not anything that would be easy to guess.) Well, let's try some dates and see what happens. I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?
Date the DC Act was enacted
Phoenix:
How about the date the Defense Culpability Act was enacted? Do you know when that was, Your Benevolence? 
Rayfa:
Nayna! Nayna!
Edgeworth:
Your Benevolence... *whisper, whisper*...
Rayfa:
Yes, of course... I believe the date would be: June 14!
Phoenix:
(Really, Edgeworth? Is whispering in the ears of elites the secret to your success?) All right, let's give 0-6-1-4 a try. Nope, that's not it. Time to try something else.
Leads back to:
"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?"
Parents' anniversary
Phoenix:
How about your parents' anniversary?
Rayfa:
Hmm... I have not the faintest idea of when it is.
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess you wouldn't, huh.
Edgeworth:
...It's December 11.
Phoenix:
H-How in the world do you know THAT fact, Edgeworth?!
Edgeworth:
Hmph, I don't. I simply deduced it using elementary school-level logic. Though I doubt you'd grasp how I arrived at my conclusion, so I'll save my breath.
Phoenix:
(There's no way you didn't use some kind of superpower to come up with that...) Anyway, here goes... 1-2-1-1. ...No good. It won't open. Let's try another number, shall we?
Leads back to:
"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?"
Rayfa's birthday
Leads to:
"When's your birthday, Your Benevolence?"
Phoenix:
When's your birthday, Your Benevolence?
Rayfa:
Hmph, you are wasting your time. It could not possibly be my birthday.
Phoenix:
Aw, come on. It's worth a shot.
Rayfa:
...Fine. It's December 24.
Phoenix:
Christmas Eve? Well, let's give it a try. 1-2-2-4... Ahhh! ...I-It... It opened!
Rayfa:
It did?!
Phoenix:
Yep. And it looks like the bottom safe was a fake.
Edgeworth:
Something meant to mislead would-be thieves, no doubt. Still, it was rendered quite ineffective by his use of such an easily-guessed combination.
Rayfa:
Wh-Why, Father...? Why my birthdate...?
Examine
Open safe
Phoenix:
Okay, let's see what's in here. Hm? This looks like a letter or something. Let's see... "Dear Father... I wanted to wish you a happy birthday. You're always so kind, and I love you very much. I hope you live to be a hundred years old! Love, Rayfa." ...............
Rayfa:
I-I wrote this to my father when I was eight years old. F-Father... Why would you hold on to... something so childish and stupid...?
Phoenix:
.........There are some other papers in here. Hmm... Ah! This... This is the plan for the coup d'état!
Rayfa:
Wh-What?! Give me that! .........I... I don't understand.
Edgeworth:
It seems Justice Minister Inga was plotting the assassination of the queen.
Rayfa:
This... This can't be true. Father would never harm Mother.
Phoenix:
(Poor Rayfa. This has to come as a terrible shock.) ...What's this? There's a photo in here, too. Hmm... It's of a woman and a baby. I wonder who they are. ...On the far left, there's a law book with the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it.
Rayfa:
.........Wait! Th-Th-That's...!
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence?
Rayfa:
...How... How can this be?
*thud*
Phoenix:
P-Princess Rayfa!
Rayfa:
...............
Phoenix:
(She's looking incredibly pale.) Your Benevolence. Are you all right?
Rayfa:
.........All right? How can I be all right?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Rayfa:
.........All that I have believed... It was all lies.
Phoenix:
I'm afraid I don't follow. (What the heck's she talking about?) Um... Can I ask who the woman is in this picture?
Rayfa:
...H-How should I know?! .........It seems I didn't know ANYTHING that was going on!
Phoenix:
(...Doesn't look like I'm going to get much more out of her while she's like this.)
Woman's Photo added to the Court Record.
Rayfa:
.........Mother.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Rayfa:
I must ask my mother... about the secret she is hiding.
Phoenix:
Um, what secret...?
Rayfa:
...I must go. Goodbye.
Phoenix:
Wait! ...What was that all about? It's like her mind was off somewhere else.
Edgeworth:
It appears this photo really upset her.
Phoenix:
(I wonder who the lady in this picture is.)
???:
Stop! Shah'do! Come back here!
???:
Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff!
Phoenix:
Wait, that sounds like... Ahlbi and Shah'do.
Edgeworth:
That's odd. Commoners aren't normally allowed in this area. I wonder what's afoot.
Anything (after examining open safe)
Phoenix:
I better not touch anything without Rayfa's permission. Who knows what she might say... or do if she finds out.
May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence
Shah'do:
Ruff ruff ruff!
Edgeworth:
Nghoooooooooh!
Phoenix:
Ahhh! Edgewooooorth!
Edgeworth:
.........I hope one of you has a good explanation for this.
Ahlbi:
Ahhhhhh! I'm SO sorry!
Phoenix:
Hi, Ahlbi...
Ahlbi:
No, Shah'do! Bad dog! Leave the man's frilly thingamajig alone!
Shah'do:
Grrrrrrrrr...
Edgeworth:
If you would kindly detach your dog from my cravat.
Ahlbi:
R-Right away, sir! Just hold still, and...
Edgeworth:
And...?
Shah'do:
Grrrrrr...
Ahlbi:
Hrrrrrgh! Hrrrrrrrrrrrgh!
Edgeworth:
Nghoooh! Stop pulling like that! You'll only stretch the fabric!
Ahlbi:
Come on, Shah'do...! Let go of his... carava-chamacallit!
Shah'do:
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
Ahlbi:
Hmm... This isn't working. I'll just have to pull harder, then... One, two...
Edgeworth:
Wait! What are you--?!
Ahlbi:
THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! RRRRRRRNNNNNNNNGH! .........Come OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
Edgeworth:
NNNNGHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! I NEED AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRR! *huff... huff... huff...* Were you trying to kill me?!
Ahlbi:
I'm really sorry, mister. My dog has a habit of attacking frilly things like that.
Phoenix:
(Maybe for his sake, he should stick to more traditional targets, like cars, or his tail...)
Ahlbi:
What's worse, he snuck in here again today and stole some weird-looking hat. I don't know what to do anymore. Bad dog! You're a very bad dog!
Shah'da:
*whine*
Phoenix:
(Wait a second... I've seen that hat before.)
Examine
Urns (after clearing all Talk options)

"Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you?"
Talk
The frilly hat
Phoenix:
Ahlbi, could I see that hat again?
Ahlbi:
Sure!
Phoenix:
(Wait... Isn't this... Isn't this Nayna's hat? But I thought she'd disappeared.)
Ahlbi:
Shah'do swiped it from someone.
Phoenix:
Um, Ahlbi? How exactly did Shah'do get this?
Ahlbi:
Allow me to explain! It all started while we were on a walk through the bazaar today. When, suddenly, Datz popped out of a manhole!
Datz:
Hah!
Ahlbi:
Whoa!
Datz:
The fangs of the Defiant Dragons... ...Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... ...Datz Are'bal is here! .........Say, you wanna join our cause, kid? 
Datz[sic]: 
Huh?
Ahlbi:
Naturally, I was super startled by that weirdo's sudden appearance.
Warbaa'd:
RAWWWWWWRRRRRR!
Shah'do:
Ruff ruff!
Datz:
Back! Dog of the Ga'ran regime! 
Datz[sic]: 
Huh, But this is my dog, Shah'do...
Datz:
Defiant Dragon secret weapon: Dragon Snot Snaps! ACHOOOO!
*BANG*
Ahlbi:
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA! Oof!
Datz:
Har har har har har! Aw man, the look on your face! That was classic!
Ahlbi:
The sudden bang of the firecracker spooked Shah'do, and he ran off into the crowds.
Shah'do:
Ruff ruff ruff ruff!
Ahlbi:
Ahhhhhh! Shah'do, come back here!
Datz:
Har har har har har! That'll teach ya, Ga'ran's lapdog!
Policeman:
You there! What do you think you're doing?!
Datz:
...Ack! Not good!
Ahlbi:
That's when a policeman came running over and hauled Datz away. That happened right around 2 PM, if I remember correctly.
Phoenix:
(...I'm not even going to pretend I know what Datz was trying to do.)
Ahlbi:
I chased right after Shah'do, and... ...when I finally caught up to him here in the palace courtyard, he had this in his mouth.
Edgeworth:
2 PM, hmm? That's about an hour before the minister's death. 
Phoenix:
Nayna supposedly went missing after the murder... ...but this would place her here at the palace at around 2.
Ahlbi's Statement added to the Court Record.
Ahlbi:
Actually! I just remembered I saw something pretty amazing around that time, too! 
Phoenix:
Something amazing?
Something amazing (appears after "The frilly hat")
Phoenix:
So, Ahlbi, what was it you saw that was so amazing?
Ahlbi:
I saw Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit!
Phoenix:
Is it really that big of a deal to see her channeling someone?
Ahlbi:
You bet it is! Commoners are never allowed to behold the sacred rite.
Phoenix:
Oh? Can you tell me more?
Ahlbi:
Of course! I'm always happy to explain! Um... I believe it was around 2:10 PM today. I got lost on the palace grounds while looking for Shah'do.
Ahlbi:
Ooh... What is this place? It gives me the creeps. Where could Shah'do have gone?
Ahlbi:
In my search, I took a peek into a small room and... ...that's when I saw Queen Ga'ran! She was channeling a spirit for a neighboring kingdom's king! I saw her transform right before my eyes! I was so excited, I had to take a picture of it!
Phoenix:
You... You took a picture?
Ahlbi:
I know I shouldn't have... ...but I just couldn't help myself!
Phoenix:
(Between this and the treasure room, Ahlbi's not exactly the picture of self-restraint...)
Ahlbi: Her channeling rite ended right after that, so I ran off before anyone could spot me.
Phoenix:
You could've been arrested again, you know.
Ahlbi:
...Yeah, I know... ........................ Anyway, here's a copy of the picture. Just don't tell anyone I was the one who took it.
Phoenix:
(...I worry about his future sometimes.)
Channeling Photo added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Come to think of it... ...how did you and Shah'do get into the royal residence anyway? it's not open to commoners, after all.
Ahlbi:
Allow me to explain!
Ahlbi in the courtyard (appears after "Something amazing")
Ahlbi:
There's a way to get into the palace from the bazaar. It's a bit of a tight squeeze, though. Shah'do can easily fit, but anyone bigger than me is out of luck.
Phoenix:
You don't say...
Ahlbi:
Yeah, part of the palace wall is damaged, and there's a hole I can just make it through.
Phoenix:
Go on.
Ahlbi:
Heh heh heh. Betcha didn't know they have some really tasty food here!
Phoenix:
Oh? Then this isn't your first time in here, huh. ...Trespassing is illegal, you know.
Ahlbi:
N-No, it's not like that! I didn't mean any harm. It's just... I want to help change this kingdom.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Ahlbi:
Well, after Ms. Fey's trial, I started thinking. Like maybe... Maybe there was something I could do to help the revolution, too.
Phoenix:
(...Maya's trial, huh. That tragedy only happened because of how twisted Khura'in's legal system has become.)
Nahyuta:
How utterly foolish to cast away one's life for such a reason! There must have been other ways to cover up the crime!
Tahrust:
Yet, had I done so, my wife would rush to my defense. And when the case went to trial... ...she would suffer the same fate as I under the Defense Culpability Act. I could not have lived with myself had she been convicted because of that fiendish man!
Rayfa:
Th-This... cannot be... All I have done under the laws of our kingdom... It has all been...
Phoenix:
(The DC Act led to the false charges against Maya and the high priest's suicide. But that trial also caused the public to start questioning the current state of things. And it seems even Ahlbi has some pretty strong feelings on the matter.)
Ahlbi:
I knew there had to be something I could do to help! That's when I remembered the hole in the palace wall, and started thinking... ...maybe I could sneak in and take a picture of one of the royals up to no good. I just want to do my part!
Edgeworth:
The spirit of revolution seems to be catching on, even with one so young. Wright, the momentum is steadily building, and the tipping point is fast approaching. It's just a matter of when.
Phoenix:
I agree. And the public's perception of the Defiant Dragons seems to be changing, too. But Ahlbi... You can't go trespassing like that. Even if it's for a good cause, it's not right.
Ahlbi:
Okay. I won't do it again.
Phoenix:
Ahlbi, is that really all you have to confess? You haven't been up to any other mischief? And when I say "you," I mean Shah'do.
Ahlbi:
Huh?! Oh, um... I-I... I don't know what you're talking about. Aheh... heh heh heh...
Phoenix:
(Nice try, Ahlbi, but the proof is literally right in front of us.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Ahlbi:
Oh, that's an attorney's badge from your homeland, right?! I've studied all about it. Allow me to explain! There's a reason why the badge is shaped like a sunflower. You know how sunflowers always turn to face the sun -- the source of their well-being? Well, lawyers are like that -- they will chase after anything that will make them money!
Phoenix:
Whaaat?!
Ahlbi:
...I guess people hate lawyers in your country, too, huh.
Phoenix:
Umm... Where did you get your information from again?
Ahlbi:
A proud sermon Chief Prosecutor Payne gave in the middle of the bazaar the other day.
Phoenix:
Nngh... Lawyers already have a bad enough time here without his lies.
Anything else
Phoenix:
What do you know about this, Ahlbi? 
Ahlbi:
.........S-Sorry. I don't know anything about that. I'm the worst tour guide ever.
Phoenix:
N-No, no, it's my fault for randomly whipping it out and asking you about it.
Ahlbi:
Don't worry. I'll study hard, so I'll be ready to answer all your questions next time!
Phoenix:
(Argh, now I feel like a jerk.)
Phoenix:
Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you?
Ahlbi:
Ah!
Phoenix:
Because Her Benevolence told me something rather interesting.
Rayfa:
Be careful. Some dingbat dog got in the courtyard and spilled water over there.
Phoenix:
A dingbat dog?
Rayfa:
That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth.
Phoenix:
The "dingbat dog" she mentioned wouldn't happen to be Shah'do, would it?
Ahlbi:
...Ooh...! ......... I guess the dog's out of the bag. Sorry I lied. But I was worried I'd get in trouble. I know I shouldn't lie to a lawyer like that. 
Phoenix:
No, it's not good to lie to anyone like that. So let's try to only tell the truth. Okay, Ahlbi?
Ahlbi:
Oh, Mr. Wright! I almost forgot. I saw a couple of Americans a moment ago. They had really weird haircuts, so I thought they might be friends of yours.
Phoenix:
...R-Really, now... Um...
Edgeworth:
It seems your little friend thinks all us Americans have strange hairstyles. I suppose we have you to thank for that, Wright?
Phoenix:
......... So, what exactly did their hair look like?
Ahlbi:
There was a guy with two crops of hair sticking out of his forehead like antennae. Then there was this lady with a long bunch of hair that looked like a big, orange spider leg.
Phoenix:
Oh, that sounds like Apollo and Athena. What were they doing?
Ahlbi:
They were racing through the bazaar... ... with the Ga'ran Royal Guard in hot pursuit!
Phoenix:
Wait, whaaaaaat?!
Edgeworth:
Why were they being pursued...?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure, but I have my suspicions. I just hope they're all right.
Ahlbi:
S-Sorry for not mentioning it before. It just kind of slipped my mind, heh heh...
To Be Continued
May 18Khura'in - Bazaar
Apollo:
*huff, puff, huff, puff* Those... Those guys... sure are... persistent!
Athena:
*huff, puff, huff, puff* Yeah. They even wore ME out, and that doesn't happen often.
Apollo:
Why are they after us, anyway?!
Athena:
Ah, Apollo! It's the royal guards again!
Apollo:
Argh! Q-Quick, hide!
Royal Guard:
Hey! Where'd Horn Head and Spidey Hair gooooooo?!!
Athena:
...Spidey Hair? They're not talking about me, are they?
Apollo:
I-Is that a trick question...?
Royal Guard:
We know you're hiding somewhere around heeeeeeeeeee!!!
RAWWWRRR!
Athena:
A-Apollo, that weird-looking bird over there... Did it just...?!
Apollo:
...Yeah, it did. It's called a warbaa'd and... You know what? I'll tell you all about it later when we're not being chased by masked men!
Royal Guard:
Come out, come out, wherever you aaaaare!!! ...Hand over the Founder's Orb, if you know what's good for yooooouuuuuu!!!
Apollo:
(It figures they're after the orb.)
Athena:
I don't want to know what they'll do to us if we were captured. If they grill us in those obnoxious, loud voices... ...I'd cave after the first hour and confess to whatever they wanted, truth or no!
Royal Guard:
Come out now, you foreign deeeeevils!!! This has gone faaaaaar enough!!! You must not keep Her Eminence waiting any looooooonger!!!
RAWWWRRR!
Apollo:
W-We've gotta get out of here! There must be a safe place to hide somewhere!
Examine
Manhole cover
Leads to:
"Look, a manhole."
Anywhere else
Apollo:
Maybe we could hide here.
Athena:
No way! They'd find us in no time!
Royal Guard:
Stay where you aaaare!!!
Athena:
Th-They're closing in on us!
Apollo:
We've gotta find a place to hide!
Talk
Any ideas?
Athena:
Apollo! We shouldn't be standing around talking like this! Who knows what they'll do to us if they catch us!
Apollo:
You're right. Let's find somewhere safe to hide!
Present
Anything
Athena:
Apollo! Do you really HAVE to show that to me right this second?!
Apollo:
S-Sorry. It's just... something I do now when I'm stuck... Anyway, your shouting isn't helping, either.
Royal Guard:
That voice! It's Spidey Hair!!!
Athena:
Eeeeek! ...Hiii-yaaaaaa!!!
Royal Guard:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
Apollo:
(Sh-She sent him flying!)
Athena:
L-Let's find somewhere else to hide before the other guards get here!
Apollo:
Look, a manhole. ...Ahhh! That's right!
Dhurke:
Say, son, do you remember my office?
Apollo:
...Sure. (I remember that messy, dimly lit room.)
Dhurke:
The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there?
Apollo:
Athena! I know where we can hide! Follow me!
Athena:
Oh?! Where are we going?!
Apollo:
Hrrrrrrrnngh!
Athena:
W-Wait. You're not seriously thinking about going down there? It smells like rotten eggs. And are those rats I hear?!
Apollo:
We've got no choice! I can get us somewhere safe, but this is the only way in. Quick, before it's too late!
Athena:
Ugh. It's going to take forever to get this stench out of my hair.
May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices
Apollo:
.........Looks like we lost them. That was close. .................. (Dhurke's office... How long has it been since I last set foot in here?) At least we're safe now, but...
Athena:
(Why is Athena all huddled over in the corner like that?)
Datz:
Ah!
Apollo:
Datz?
Datz:
AJ! What the heck are ya doing here?
Apollo:
Ga'ran's royal guards are after us.
Datz:
Har har har! Once a rebel, always a rebel. Don't worry. The regime doesn't know about this place, so ya can relax now.
Apollo:
Good. But since when am I part of the rebellion? I don't recall signing up.
???:
Apollo!
Apollo:
Mr. Wright? What are you doing here?
Phoenix:
We say you two go into that manhole.
Edgeworth:
You narrowly escaped the guards' notice.
Phoenix:
It was like watching a pair of ostriches burying their heads in the sand.
Apollo:
(I guess that was a closer shave than I had thought...)
Phoenix:
Anyway, you're safe and sound now, and that's what really counts. Oh, I also have some evidence for you.
Apollo:
Thanks, Mr. Wright.
Case evidence received from the boss.
Edgeworth:
So, what is this dubious hovel we've found ourselves in, anyway?
Apollo:
It's the Defiant Dragons' safe house... also known as the former Sahdmadhi Law Offices.
Edgeworth:
I see... Well. Though it might just be happenstance... ...here I am -- a chief prosecutor -- hiding out in a rebel base.
Apollo:
Um, please don't report this place to the local police, Prosecutor Edgeworth... (Might as well take a look around while we're waiting for the heat to die down out there.) Come on, Athena. Stop moping over there and help me check this place out.
Athena:
*shudder* Please tell me there's a shower here.
Apollo:
There's a sink in the kitchen. And if you're lucky, maybe even some soap.
Athena:
.........I'm sorry I even asked.
Examine
Picture of Ga'ran
Apollo:
There's a scary-looking knife sticking out of the queen's picture. If anyone saw this, they'd think the Defiant Dragons were a violent group.
Datz:
Oh, that? That was actually me trying to kill a fly. I threw that knife at it and whiffed, and the thing ended up stuck right between her eyes.
Apollo:
You mean this wasn't on purpose?!
White flowers
Apollo:
Datz, what's with the altar?
Datz:
It's where we pay our respects to the victims of the Defense Culpability Act. The DC Act is a heinous law that puts innocent people to death!
Apollo:
(A law that's supposed to protect the people sends them to their graves instead... Talk about insane.)
Ladder
Athena:
Wait... Don't tell me we have to go back through the manhole to get out of here...
Apollo:
The only reason this safe house is still safe is because the front door's been boarded up.
Athena:
Fine, then I'll just have to live here till the revolution begins!
Apollo:
...What if I told you rats come out at night?
Athena;
Then we'll just have to start the revolution before sundown!
Apollo:
(I bet the revolution never thought it'd get a new ally this way.)
Photos
Athena:
Hm? Who's the kid... Wait a second! That's YOU, Apollo! I'd recognize those horns anywhere!
Apollo:
Is that really the only way ANYBODY recognizes me?!
Athena:
Hee hee hee. You were so cute! ...And who's THAT fine-looking young man?
Apollo:
That's Nahyuta, back when he used to smile.
Athena:
...Wow. His smile is absolutely angelic.
Datz:
Sure brings back memories! That was taken the day we all went out fishing.
Athena:
What was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi like when he was younger?
Datz:
He was kinda quiet, but passionate when it came to his convictions. When he finally made prosecutor, he was all fired up to change Khura'in for the better. But now he's nothing more than Ga'ran's lackey!
Apollo:
(Seems like Datz has a lot to say about Nahyuta. I'll ask him about his thoughts later.
Photos (subsequent times)
Apollo:
These pictures sure bring back memories. Nahyuta is cheerfully smiling in this one. That quiet smile he gives in court now seems almost fake by comparison.
Lizards
Athena:
Eeewww... Is that a newt? 
Apollo:
Come on, Athena. Can't you tell a gecko when you see one?
Athena:
What's the difference?
Apollo:
Geckos like to live in houses, while newts prefer to be outside near water. They're totally different creatures.
Athena:
Well, how do you know this one wasn't caught outside near some water? It could very well be a gecko.
Apollo:
No, I'm pretty sure it's a newt.
Athena:
Oh, so then you agree it's a newt, Apollo?
Apollo:
Ack! (I fell right into her trap!)
Phoenix:
You're both wrong. It's just a plain old lizard.
TV
Apollo:
I'm surprised to see so many appliances here. There's even a TV. 
Datz:
Speaking of which, we gave the people of Khura'in quite a shock... ...when "The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm" was last on TV.
Apollo:
You mean that show where actors play the parts of Dhurke and Rayfa? You hijacked that in the middle of its broadcast, right?
Datz:
Yep. All their writers do each week is try to ruin the Defiant Dragons' good name. So we decided to hit 'em where it hurts! Har har har har har har!
Apollo:
That must've been real shocking, especially for the kids who'd waited all week to see it. I mean, the show's main villain was actually hijacking the very show he's in!
Coat
Athena:
Dhurke's jacket... You should try it on, Apollo. It might actually suit you.
Apollo:
R-Really?
Datz:
There's also a spare eye patch here. Why not try that on, too?
Athena:
...Pffft. ...*snicker* Hee hee hee! S-Sorry, sorry. Just picturing you in all that... Ha ha ha ha! It's just too funny!
Apollo:
(Oww... My pride...)
Sign
Apollo:
Sahdmadhi Law Offices... That's the sign Dhurke used to display out front. Hey, Datz. I heard the office used [sic]do quite a bit of business. 
Datz:
That it did. Dhurke was a famous lawyer with countless courtroom victories, after all. He was the Dauntless Dragon who turned trials upside down... ...snatching victory from the jaws of defeat! His fame as a lawyer spread far and wide across Khura'in back in the day. 
Apollo:
...I hope the day comes when he can proudly display this sign again.
Spider
Apollo:
What's with all the spider webs, Datz? Don't you ever clean the place?
Datz:
Not the webs! We have what ya call a symbiotic relationship. They catch the bugs that get in here, and I don't clean 'em up!
Apollo:
You know... that actually makes a lot of sense.
Book
Apollo:
This is Dhurke's old law book.
Athena:
Look, there's a mark on the cover. It looks like it was branded with a hot iron.
Apollo:
Yeah, I think it was done in protest against the Defense Culpability Act. There's an entry on the DC Act right here. See?
Athena:
Oh, so this is the infamous anti-lawyer law you guys are always talking about...
Dhurke's Law Book added to the Court Record.
File
Athena:
I wonder what's in this file. Oh, it's full of newspaper clippings. 
Apollo:
It seems to be a collection of documents and information on Amara's assassination. (So this is what Dhurke was talking about.)
Athena:
We already know most of the stuff here on top. Let's see what else there is. Wow, where did he get all this? Umm... Anything important here...? Hmm, what about this... "Apollo's roving musician father got caught up in this incident and lost his life." ...Whaaat?! Th-This is about your father, Apollo!
Apollo:
Looks like it. But I was never told much more than what's written here.
Athena:
Really? How come? 
Apollo:
Dhurke always skated around the subject. Maybe he thought I was still too young. Plus, I always thought of Dhurke as my dad, so I never really brought it up.
Athena:
...Oh, I see. Still... I feel kind of sorry for your real dad.
Apollo:
(My real dad... I was never really interested in learning about him. But after seeing his picture, I can't help but feel a little curious. I wonder if Datz could tell me anything about him.)
Amara's Assassination File added to the Court Record.
Athena:
...Apollo, this file looks like it might be useful. But there are so many pages, I can't tell what's important. 
Apollo:
We ne4ed someone to help organize all of this. (And I think I know just the person to ask.)
File (subsequent times)
Apollo:
This file has a ton of information on Amara's assassination. We should go over the important parts later.
Talk
Sahdmadhi Law Offices
Apollo:
So, Datz, you guys are still using this office, I see. 
Datz:
Yep. 'Cept now it's the official HQ of the Defiant Dragons. But as Dhurke said, and I quote... "We must keep it for the day when Khura'in needs lawyers once more."
Phoenix:
Restoring the legal system to its rightful form through popular uprising... You can tell how much Khurke believes in his cause.
Datz:
Oh, and AJ. Dhurke said something else that might interest ya. He said he hopes you'll come back and take over this office someday. 
Apollo:
T-Take over?! Me?
Datz:
Those were his words. He may've been half joking though.
Datz:
Dhurke! Guess what I heard from PW! AJ's become a lawyer!
Dhurke:
...Yeah, I've been meaning to tell you. 
Datz:
Must've been because of you, Dhurke!
Dhurke:
I'm not so sure about that. I imagine he's already forgotten about me.
Datz:
Whaddaya talking about? I bet he can't wait to follow in your footsteps.
Dhurke:
Hah, ha ha ha. Nothing would make me happier. Maybe one day he'll return to Khura'in and take over this office. ...Heh. It's just a pipe dream, though.
Apollo:
.........Dhurke really said that?
Datz:
Dhurke was never a hands-on kinda dad... ...but not a day went by that he wasn't thinking of ya. That much I'm sure of.
Athena:
Doesn't get more paternal than that.
Apollo:
(Dhurke... And to think, I really did spend my days trying to forget you. I'm looking forward to a nice, long talk once you're free.)
Nahyuta (appears after examining photos)
Apollo:
Datz, wasn't Nahyuta once part of the Defiant Dragons?
Datz:
Yep. Yuty was a rising star in the resistance! He vowed to fight for the cause through the legal system. Said he's become a prosecutor, and give Inga and Ga'ran the smackdown they deserved!
Apollo:
But now he's...
Datz:
Yeah... a puppet of the Ga'ran regime. Not only that, but now he's gonna prosecute his own dad. It doesn't add up!
Athena:
I wonder what happened to him.
Datz:
Me, too. But if I had to guess... ...I'd say Ga'ran has some serious leverage over him.
Apollo:
Leverage? Like what?
Datz:
Wish I knew. But it seems like Dhurke knows. I tried to press him about it, but he wouldn't say.
Apollo:
(Come to think of it, Dhurke did say...)
Apollo:
Nahyuta... is suffering...?
Dhurke:
Yes. He knows the rightful state of Khura'in's legal system... ...but something forced him to bend to Ga'ran's will, and it's tearing him apart.
Apollo:
(If that's the case... ...I bet Nahyuta doesn't really want to go through with Dhurke's prosecution.)
My father (appears after presenting Photo of My Father)
Apollo:
Do you know what my biological father was like?
Datz:
Dhurke once told me about him. He was a modern minstrel, walking the world and making music in his travels.
Athena:
This file also has some information on your real dad. It says he died in the blaze at Queen Amara's residence twenty-three years ago.
Datz:
That's right. Dhurke had invited him over. Dhurke's the kinda guy who can become fast friends with just about anyone. And it seems your pops was like that, too, AJ. They hit it off at a bar... ...and the next thing ya know, Dhurke's asked him over to play some tunes.
Apollo:
And then the place went up in flames...
Datz:
Yeah. Dhurke had just stepped out for a sec when the fire broke out. .........Apollo. You were there, too, but you were still just a baby.
Apollo:
...I remember hearing about that when I was little.
Datz:
Yeah, it was a crying shame. Your pops just happened to take you along that day. So you were there with him when the fire broke out. But Dhurke risked his life to save you!
Apollo:
(It's like Dhurke's done nothing but save me all my life...)
Datz:
All your pops's stuff got burned up. Including anything that could've helped us identify him. All we knew about him at first was his stage name, "Jangly Justice" or something like that. Dhurke did everything he could just to dig up what little we know now.
Apollo:
...Um, what about my mother? Do you know anything about her?
Datz:
All we know is she was traveling with your pops. But that day, she was off doing something on her own.
Apollo:
So then, she probably didn't even know my father had been with Dhurke, huh.
Athena:
But she must've been desperate to find you and your father once you'd gone missing.
Datz:
No doubt. But the queen's assassination threw the kingdom into chaos. The police were so overwhelmed, they were probably hardly of any help to her. We searched and searched till our legs gave out, too, but we never found her. And with your father's stuff all burned up, we had zero leads -- not even a photo.
Apollo:
So that's how I became an orphan...
Datz:
Yeah... Who knows? Maybe your mom read about the details of the fire in the newspaper. And maybe she figured you'd died along with your pops.
Athena:
Wow, I had no idea you'd been through all that, Apollo.
Present
Photo of My Father
Apollo:
Datz, I wanted to ask you about this picture.
Datz:
That's the picture of your pops that Dhurke found. And he had a heck of a time tracking it down. He said he searched all over for it!
Apollo:
Why...? Why would he go through all that trouble?
Athena:
Datz, please tell us everything you know about Apollo's dad!
Dhurke's Law Book
Datz:
The Mark of the Dragon... That's the symbol of our group, the Defiant Dragons.
Apollo:
Dhurke has the same mark tattooed on the palm of his hand, right?
Datz:
Yep. And I've got one, too.
Apollo:
Really? Where?
Datz:
On my heart!
Apollo:
...Oh, you mean metaphorically. Like you're ready to die at any time for the cause or something like that?
Datz:
You got that right. Dead or alive, I'll always be a Defiant Dragon!
Amara's Assassination File
Apollo:
Datz, about this file... Can you help me figure out whihc pages are the most relevant?
Datz:
Yup, sure can. I got the whole thing memorized. See this page? It's definitely worth a look.
Athena:
Oh, that's right! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi was part of the royal family, wasn't he!
Datz:
Yep. But he was expelled after that whole thing with Dhurke happened. He must've gone through hell once he entered the legal world though.
Apollo:
Because of the whole "the sins of the father are visited upon his children" thing?
Datz:
Yep. In the eyes of the people, Dhurke is not only a traitor to his kingdom... ...he's also the terrorist who assassinated the previous queen. So, as his son, Yuty no doubt got the cold shoulder at every turn.
Apollo:
That must've been really hard on him.
Datz:
Yeah, the ties between father and son aren't something you could break, even if you tried. No matter where he went, he was probably labeled the son of a criminal. But despite it all, he made a name for himself through blood, sweat, and tears. I mean, just look at him now. He's a star prosecutor working cases around the globe. He's become a hero! The pride and joy of Khura'in!
Apollo:
(Now that's the Nahyuta I know -- super smart and never willing to give in. He must've studied and fought like his life depended on it to get to where he is today.)
Amaras Assassination File updated in the Court Record.
Anything else
Datz:
Ahhhhhh!
Apollo:
What? Do you know something about this?
Datz:
Nope. Just felt like shouting is all.
Apollo:

Old Man:
So then you believe me? You believe in my son's innocence?!
Beh'leeb:
Your poor son -- imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit... Let's petition the government for his release and a declaration of innocence!
Old Man: 
Oh, thank you, thank you! I'm forever in your debt!
Apollo:
Hm? Who's that?
Datz:
Hey there, Mrs. Inmee. Hard at work, I see. 
Beh'leeb:
Yes, I have my own battle that I must wage. After all, there are many who suffer under the Defense Culpability Act.
Rebel:
Mrs. Inmee! Please don't forget about our case, too!
Beh'leeb:
I won't! I will look into it as soon as I am able.
Phoenix:
Um, Datz? What's Mrs. Inmee doing here?
Datz:
She's lending an ear to all those suffering under the regime's wrongful accusations. A lady whose husband's been imprisoned, parents whose son's been falsely charged... She's helping all those types of people.
Phoenix:
So she's trying to help the revolution along... ...in her own special way.
Datz:
Yep. And thanks to her, more and more folks are coming over to our side! All the people who've been unhappy with the regime have been waiting for just this chance! And they're starting to speak out in support of us!
Apollo:
(The people are responding... and a grassroots movement is growing... Dhurke's dream of revolution may finally come true.)
Athena:
What should we do about the Founder's Orb? We'll probably run into the royal guards again the moment we leave this place.
Phoenix:
Well, we can't stay here forever, so we'll have to think of something.
Apollo:
...I've got it. Why don't you hold on to it, Datz? It should be safe here, right?
Datz:
You can count on me! I'll get it back to you in time for tomorrow's trial at the Hall of Justice.
Founder's Orb left with Datz.
Athena:
What now, Apollo?
Apollo:
Well, we've got a handle on what happened twenty-three years ago. Maybe we should pay Dhurke a visit. There's something I want to show him. 
Phoenix:
I'll join you. I want to talk to him before tomorrow's trial.
Edgeworth:
Maybe I should wait here, then. We'll attract undue attention if we go in too large of a group.

Yak
Apollo:
It's a yak. They used to serve as a beast of burden here.
Athena:
They're actually kind of cute up-close. Hello there, big fella! Or are you a girl...?
Apollo:
Umm, if you stick your face that close to it, it's liable to--
*sluuuuurp*
Athena:
Eeewwww, gross! ..................
Apollo:

Athena:
I-I could use a handful of wet naps, if you've got 'em...
Bird
Athena:
What's this bird doing here?
Apollo:
I wouldn't get too close to it if I were you.
???:
RAWWWWWWRRRRRR!
Athena:
Eeeeeeeeek!
Apollo:
...Athena, meet the warbaa'd. Its cry resembles a lion's roar to scare off predators.
Athena:
Wow... that's one gutsy little bird. But I bet it's not really all that tough.
Apollo:
How about we just leave the bird alone?
Cart
Apollo:
(So many street stalls... And they all have stuff you can't find back home.)
Athena:
We should spend some time shopping here when this case is over. I'd like to buy Trucy a souvenir or something.
Poster
Apollo:
There's a poster here... "The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm"...?
Phoenix:
It's a special-effects-driven action-here show that's become a huge hit here in Khura'in.
Apollo:
(Maybe it's a cultural thing, but she totally looks like a villain to me.)
Steaming buns
Phoenix:
Khura'in's national delicacy, magatah'man -- or "soul buns," if that makes it easier. Apparently, they're so delicious, they'll send your soul straight to the Twilight Realm.
Apollo:
"Delicious"? More like "deadly."
Phoenix:
Actually, in one of the commercials, an old man literally drops dead after taking a bite. And at the very end, there's a warning that goes, "Enjoy at your own risk."
Apollo:
Like I said: deadly.
Manhole cover
Apollo:
(This is the manhole that leads to Dhurke's office-turned-safe house. It's the only way in or out. And for obvious reasons, there's no doorbell or welcome mat.)
Souvenir stands
Apollo:
(The souvenir stands sure are popular with the tourists. I should check them out later.)
Tehm'pul Temple
Apollo:
Tehm'pul Temple is just up ahead. When I was a kid, I used to race Nahyuta and my friends to the top.

Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo
Athena:
The victim was the Minister of Justice, the second most powerful person here in Khura'in. In Wright Anything Agency terms... ...I guess that would be you, Apollo.
Apollo:
Ha ha ha. Thanks, but... ...everyone knows it's Trucy.
Athena:
...Yeah, you're probably right. On second thought, she might actually be number one. I mean, even Mr. Wright is no match for her.
Apollo:
.........Remind me not to forget to buy her a souvenir.
Dhurke's Law Book
Athena:
I can't believe Dhurke's been fighting the good fight for over twenty years. Fighting for the truth and the repeal of the Defense Culpability Act...
Apollo:
Yeah. And being branded a traitor for it. That's got to be extremely hard on him.
Athena:
Whatever happens, we can't let them find him guilty! We have to help him achieve his life's dream!
Anything else
Athena:
.........What? Are you just going to show that to me without a word?
Apollo:
(I guess she doesn't have anything to say about it.)
Athena:
W-Well?! Are you going to at least say SOMETHING?!

Phoenix:
Edgeworth and I already searched this room.
Apollo:
Oh, okay. (I wonder if anything interesting turned up?)
Hair Dye
Athena:
"Je suis L'Belle! SAMPLE"... Now THERE'S a brand I know well...
Apollo:
.........Yeah... Me, too.
Athena:
Let's see what it says on the back. "The hair care sensation celebrities have been RAVING about!" "Guaranteed to make you WANT to proclaim, 'Je suis L'Belle!' to the world!" "This product is NOT FOR SALE. EVER. Even if you come to really like it, PEASANT."
Apollo:
I REALLY still don't get his sales strategy...
Anything else
Phoenix:
We already investigated that, Apollo.
May 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Dhurke:
Hey there, son. Came to see your old man again?
Apollo:
Hi, Dhurke. Guess they're done questioning you?
Dhurke:
Yeah... You'd think Nahyuta might've cut his old man a little slack, but no. He really laid into me. Seems they're really keen on recovering the Founder's Orb. When I wouldn't tell them where it was, he confiscated what few possessions I had left.
Apollo:
(...Wait, Dhurke's not wearing his attorney's badge. They even took THAT from him? *sigh*)
Talk
Nahyuta
Dhurke:
He confiscated all my prized jailbreaking tools.
Apollo:
What did you expect? I mean, no prosecutor in their right mind would let a prisoner keep stuff like that.
Athena:
Did he take your attorney's badge, too?
Dhurke:
No. I thought it strange, but... ...just when it looked like he was going to take it from me, he changed his mind.
Apollo:
I wonder why.
Dhurke:
Indeed. I find it hard to understand anything he does these days.
Your attorney's badge (appears after "Nahyuta")
Apollo:
Your Khura'inese attorney's badge... You've worn it all these years -- even though all the lawyers are gone.
Dhurke:
Yes, because the Dragon's Eye is the embodiment of my creed.
Apollo:
(To show the world that "a dragon never yields," huh.)
Apollo:
Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right?
Dhurke:
This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath.
Nahyuta:
"A dragon never yields," right?!
Dhurke:
Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny.
Apollo:
(He was always saying stuff like that to the two of us. Nahyuta... Is the reason why you didn't take Dhurke's badge... ...because you still remember those talks, too? I really hope that's what it is.)
Dhurke:
...Son, would you keep my badge for me?
Apollo:
Are you sure?! I can't take something so important to you.
Dhurke:
That's exactly why I want you to hold on to it, Apollo. I'm placing my fate in your hands.
Apollo:
.........All right. I'll make sure it stays safe.
Dhurke's Badge added to the Court Record.

Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo
Dhurke:
Inga Karkhuul Khura'in... He was an entirely insufferable, unlikable fellow, but I never thought he'd wind up dead.
Apollo:
Why didn't you like him?
Dhurke:
He was the most hawkish one in the Ga'ran regime. He established the secret police to arrest us rebels without due process. Those they managed to capture were immediately executed. My compatriots in the Defiant Dragons came to call him "The Executioner."
Apollo:
"The Executioner"? Pretty ironic, considering how he ended up.
Dhurke:
He's probably in Hell now, being tormented by those he wrongfully put to death.
Pink Butterfly Pendant
Apollo:
I found this in the tomb. Look familiar?
Dhurke:
...Ah! Th-That's...
Apollo:
Dhurke?
Dhurke:
Where did you find it?
Apollo:
Down between the monk statues in the tomb. Is it yours, Dhurke?
Dhurke:
.........Oh, um, it's... it's something I bought.
Apollo:
? (Why's he suddenly acting all awkward?)
Dhurke:
Hmm... I wonder when I lost it. let's have it. It's very important to me.
Apollo:
O-Of course... (I'll just make a note about it for future reference.)
Pink Butterfly Pendant returned to Dhurke, but a record of it remains in the Court Record.
Dhurke's Law Book
Dhurke:
Careful with that. Don't go showing it around town. You'll be branded a rebel.
Apollo:
But I'm not a rebel.
Dhurke:
Don't be ridiculous. You're a member of the Defiant Dragons simply by being my son. Or did you think that dragon tattoo on your rear end was just for show?
Athena:
Whaaat?! You have a tattoo on your butt, Apollo?! Let me see!
Apollo:
Relax, Athena. He's just jerking our chains again.
Amara's Assassination File
Dhurke:
I prepared that myself. Use it well.
Apollo:
I'm surprised you were able to gather this much information.
Dhurke:
It wasn't easy. After all, all of the evidence from the assassination was lost in the fire. And the newly-installed Ga'ran regime was in full control of the media. Every lead I tried to follow led to a dead end.
Apollo:
So then how am I supposed to solve this case?
Dhurke:
...You'll figure something out once tomorrow's trial is underway. After all, no one's looked into this assassination since my last trial.
Apolo:
(I hope I can turn things around enough to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.)
Dhurke's Badge
Dhurke:
Ah, my attorney's badge. You don't see those around here anymore.
Apollo:
It's not exactly something you can wear publicly, is it?
Dhurke:
Yeah... And if you did, people would jeer and throw things at you. I've had tomatoes, cabbages -- even eggs thrown at me.
Apollo:
That sounds awful. But at least they didn't throw rocks.
Dhurke:
...True. Plus, if you were good at catching things, you'd have the start of a good meal.
Apollo:
What?!
Dhurke:
It's true. An hour's walk can yield all you need for a nice, big hot pot! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
(Dhurke... I'm sorry I never knew how bad things were when you were raising us.)
Anything else
Dhurke:
Is that for me, son?
Apollo:
No, I was just wondering if you knew anything about it.
Dhurke:
What? You came to visit me and you didn't even bring a present?
Apollo:
(I'll take that as a "no.")
After clearing all Talk options and presenting Pink Butterfly Pendant:
Phoenix:
Apollo, remember how Inga said he had "someone dear to Dhurke"? Why don't you ask about that?
Apollo:
Oh, right. I'll give it a try.
Talk
Someone dear to Dhurke
Apollo:
What did the minister mean when he said... ...he had someone dear to you in the palm of his hand? Who was he talking about?
Dhurke:
Hm? 
Apollo:
Nahyuta seemed to know, but he wouldn't tell me anything.
Dhurke:
W-Well, I've no idea, so...
Phoenix:
Well, you obediently followed his every word after he said that... ...so it seems to me the minister was in close proximity to someone you really care about.
Dhurke:
Oh, um...
Apollo:
Someone you really care about that isn't Nahyuta...? Wait, don't tell me--! Is there a new lady in your life, Dhurke?!
Dhurke:
Wh-What?! No! Don't be ridiculous, son!
Apollo:
..................
Dhurke:
.................. The love of my life was Amara. But she's gone now and there will never be another.
Apollo:
(Ah! My bracelet! Wait, does this mean...? Dhurke... Have you REALLY not met somebody new?)

Apollo:
You seem uneasy, Dhurke. Wait... Don't tell me you're ashamed because she's much younger than you?!
Dhurke:
D-Don't be ridiculous! I'm just getting tense because of your intrusive questions! Anyone would react the same way!
Apollo:
(Hmm, I guess that's not it... Still, my bracelet reacted... ...so I know he must be hiding something!
Apollo:
...Dhurke. You can't fool me. You tensed up when you said, "But she's gone now." And you unconsciously moved your arm... ...causing something to press up against your jacket.
Dhurke:
Ahhhhh! ...H-How did you do that?!
Apollo:
...Oh, so that's it! You're hiding a woman's photo up your sleeve. You don't have to keep secrets like that from me, Dhurke. You're an eligible bachelor now. But you'll... introduce her to me at some point, right?
Dhurke:
I keep telling you, there's no other woman!
Apollo:
Fine, then let's see it. What are you hiding up your sleeve?
Dhurke:
...It's just this. Satisfied?
Apollo:
Huh? But that's the pendant we found in Amara's Tomb...
Dhurke:
See? I wasn't trying to hide anything.
Apollo:
(...Then why did he tense up?) Dhurke, let me take a look at that.
Dhurke:
Ah!
Apollo:
.........Hey, what's this button for?
*click*
Apollo:
Whoa! I-It's...! It's a picture of Khurke and some lady! And she's really young-looking, too!
Athena:
Mon Dieu! Are you into younger women, Dhurke?!
Apollo:
Heh heh. Dhurke, you old dog, you. You got yourself a younger lover.
Dhurke:
Will you stop with this nonsense! This is Amara before she died. If you look closer, you'll see that I was younger, too.
Apollo:
Hey, you're right.
Athena:
Aww. That's no fun.
Apollo:
...Wait a second. Haven't we seen this woman before?
Athena:
.........Now that you mention it...!
Apollo:
Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo?

Apollo... I don't see how that has anything to do with the woman in the pendant's photo.
Dhurke:
Have you had your eyes checked lately, son?
Apollo:
(I'm wrong, not blind! Maybe I should compare the pendant's photo against the evidence again.) Dhurke, I know I've seen the woman in the pendant's photo before.
Leads back to:
Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo?
Apollo:
The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo.
Dhurke:
A-Apollo, where did you get this?
Apollo:
From the safe in Inga's room.
Phoenix:
...Apollo. If this is Queen Amara, it had to have been taken at least twenty-three years ago. But that's just not possible.
Apollo:
Yeah, I just noticed the same thing. Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old!

Apollo:
Dhurke:
I don't see how that proves anything.
Apollo:
Look closer. Doesn't that part look, you know, kinda modern?
Athena:
Hmm... I don't know about that. Maybe you just don't know what's considered new and hip these days, Apollo.
Apollo:
Nngh...
Dhurke:
This photo is at least twenty-three years old. I don't know how you could say otherwise.
Apollo:
That's where you're wrong, Dhurke. (There's something in this photo that couldn't have existed back then.)
Leads back to:
"Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old!"
Apollo:
Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. But that mark didn't exist until after you started your revolutionary activities, Dhurke. So, this photo must've been taken AFTER Ga'ran came into power. ...And that didn't happen until AFTER Amara was assassinated.
Dhurke:
Gnrk!
Apollo:
...So then, how could Amara even be in this photo? ...............Wait a second. That would mean that Amara is... ...still alive?
Dhurke:
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! ............Looks like you found me out, son.
Apollo:
Wait... So it's actually true?!
Someone dear to Dhurke (after perceiving)
Apollo:
Dhurke! What do you mean, Amara's still alive?! I thought she'd been assassinated.
Dhurke:
.........So did I. But it seems she made it out alive, only to be held captive by the Ga'ran regime.
Apollo:
Why would they do that?
Dhurke:
When I fled from the law and went underground twenty-three years ago... ...I heard some shocking news from a Defiant Dragons spy. There were rumors of Queen Amara being sighted in the palace.
Apollo:
And those rumors turned out to be true?
Dhurke:
Yes. I snuck into the palace to see for myself. She was confined within the grounds, but otherwise, she was as fit as a fiddle.
Phoenix:
S-So then, the sarcophagus in the tomb... It's empty?
Dhurke:
Yes. That entire tomb is one big charade. Ga'ran had it built to stage Amara's death.
Athena:
So we're not going to be cursed by her vengeful spirit? That's a relief.
Dhurke:
She was being held under virtual house arrest. So I freed her, and we made a run for it. This photo was taken back then.
Apollo:
(Look at how they're both grinning from ear to ear.) .........Hm? (There's a fingerprint on the metal part. I guess Dhurke must've left it by accident.)
Athena:
Ooh, Mr. Sahdmadhi! I wanna hear ALL about how you ran away with Queen Amara!
Pink Butterfly Pendant updated in the Court Record.
On the run with Amara (appears after "Someone dear to Dhurke")
Apollo:
I'm surprised Amara agreed to run away with you. I mean, Ga'ran must've told her that you tried to kill her.
Dhurke:
I tried to convince her that I wasn't the one who set the blaze.
Apollo:
And she believed you?
Dhurke:
She said, and I quote, "I shall accompany you so I may ascertain the truth myself." Heh, she always was a tough one to read.
Athena:
I bet she was thrilled you came to her rescue, Mr. Sahdmadhi. To be set free by your beloved... It's like something out of a fairy tale.
Dhurke:
Yeah, well... There was no "happily ever after" once Ga'ran's people caught up with us. They took Amara away to who-knows-where. I snuck back into the palace and searched high and low for her, but to no avail. They probably moved her to some remote mountain prison or the like.
Apollo:
Dhurke, does Nahyuta know about this?
Dhurke:
He knows she's his true mother. I told him as much.
Apollo:
Wait... Is that why Nahyuta is following Ga'ran's orders?
Dhurke:
.........Most likely.
Athena:
So then, do you think that deep down, he doesn't really want to prosecute you?
Dhurke:
Well, he's not one to show his feelings. And lately, I've had no idea what he's thinking.
Phoenix:
Apollo. We need to grill the queen about Amara when we have the chance.
Athena:
...Um. I was wondering about something. The little baby the lady's holding... Is that Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Apollo:
Not necessarily. It could just as well be me. After all, we're only one year apart.
Athena:
I don't know. I mean, the kid in the picture is too cute to be you.
Apollo:
(...Let's settle this by asking Dhurke himself.)

Dhurke:
...Hm? Wait, don't tell me... Have you fallen for Princess Rayfa, son?
Apollo:
Wait, what?!
Athena:
...Apollo. I had no idea you liked your women so young.
Apollo:
No! I don't!
Phoenix:
She's barely in her teens. That's just not right, Apollo.
Apollo:
Listen to me! I never said anything about her!
Dhurke:
Aww, it's all right son. In a few more years, the age difference won't matter so much.

Athena:
See? I told you it was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.
Dhurke:
Hm? .........Oh, I see. Well, either way, it's not you, son.
Apollo:
So then... ...if it's Nahyuta, it was taken when he was about a year old, right? And that would mean... ...you ran away with Amara around 22 or 23 years ago?
Dhurke:
Hm? .........You're pretty good with numbers, son! Impressive.
Apollo:
Huh? (What kind of answer is that?)
Woman's Photo updated in the Court Record.
Dhurke:

Apollo:
What is it, Dhurke? I've never seen you act so serious before.
Apollo:
So what's this "something important" you have to tell me?
Dhurke:
........................ Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ............... ...I... I don't have long to live.
Apollo:
Huh? ............... Wh-What are you talking about? 
Dhurke:
What I mean is, I can already hear the Twilight Realm calling my name. There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me.
Apollo:
What?! ............I-Is this another one of your jokes?
Dhurke:
I wish it was.
Apollo:
Ha... Ha ha ha. You can't fool me, Dhurke. (Hm? That's strange. Why isn't my bracelet reacting?)
Dhurke:

Phoenix:
...Are you sick?
Dhurke:
I-It's something like that.
Apollo:
So you're not joking?
Dhurke:
.........I'm afraid not, son. Sorry.
Apollo:
I-Isn't there a cure? Or at least some sort of treatment?
Dhurke:
Unfortunately not. Not for what I've got.
Apollo:
If you need some kind of surgery, I'll work hard until I can pay for it! So... Please...!
Dhurke:
.........It's too late. There's nothing more to be done now.
Apollo:
B-But you always say, "A dragon never yields." So why are you giving up now?
Dhurke:
...Apollo, I'm sorry. I really am.
Apollo:
............I don't understand. Why is this happening, Dhurke? Why?
Dhurke:
..................Listen, Apollo. I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you keep quiet about this? I don't want my fellow Dragons to find out. They'd lose all hope if they knew I was dying. Would you do that for me?
Apollo:
............Of course. (Why is this happening now? Just when I was finally starting to feel like you really are my... I thought that this time, we'd finally... But now...) ...Damn it... Why...?
Athena:
Apollo...
Dhurke:
Listen, son. I don't have much longer to live... ...but I'll never let them execute me. Not before I finish what I need to do.
Apollo:
...I know, Dhurke. There's no way I'm going to let them prove you guilty. (Before he goes, I'm going to turn back time by righting the wrongs that have been done. I'm going to restore Dhurke's freedom... ...and return a real smile to Nahyuta's face! I'm going to win this case. I just have to!)
Dhurke:
...Son. I have one more... big secret.
Apollo:
What? There's something else you've been hiding from me?
Dhurke:
I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying a certain someone if I did.
Apollo:
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
Dhurke:
.........Forgive me. You'll just have to find out for yourself. That's the only way.
Apollo:
I don't understand, Dhurke.
Dhurke:
..................... Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with a truth that is difficult to accept. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all!
Apollo:
...Dhurke. (What is he talking about? Wait... He's not going to reveal that he actually IS the killer, is he?)
Phoenix:
Looks like we've run out of things to discuss. Apollo? ...Are you okay?
Apollo:
...I'm fine.
???:
FREE HIM NOW...!!! RELEASE DHURKE...!!!
Apollo:
What's going on out there?
Dhurke:
Sounds like the party's getting started without me.
Apollo:
Huh?
Athena:
It's coming from the temple. Let's go, Apollo, and take a look!
May 18Tehm'pul Temple
Apollo:
Wh-Whoa! What IS all this?!
Anime cutscene
Datz:
Ow-ow-oww! Let go, will ya?!
Policeman:
W-What are they--
Datz:
Huh? Well, look at that! The people are coming to take their courts back!
Policeman:
Don't hold back, men! Arrest them all!
Rebel:
Dhurke belongs to the people! Give him back! 
Rebel:
Yeaaaaah! Where are you holding him?!
Policeman:
Quiet down, you!
Child:
Th-They have my big sister, too! But she didn't do anything wrong!
Policeman:
Ouch! YOUCH! Stop pulling my hair!
Old Man:
Release my son! Release him now...!!!
Policeman:
Aaaagh! Stop that! No biting!
Apollo:
This... is really something.
Phoenix:
And it looks like Datz and Mrs. Inmee are leading the charge.
???:
...You unenlightened fools. Do you honestly think this will change anything?
Datz:
Yuty! ...Why do you keep serving that witch Ga'ran?!
Apollo:
Ah! (It's...) Hey, Nahyuta!
Nahyuta:
! You again?
Apollo:
What's going on here?
Nahyuta:
It would appear that the insurgents are fanning the flames of the rebellion. ...But I never thought it would grow so large. However, they will all be under arrest shortly. Reinforcements are almost here.
Apollo:
They'll be arrested? Just for protesting?
Nahyuta:
They are aiding and abetting a criminal by seeking his release. Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, has ordered they be arrested and judged en masse.
Apollo:
B-But weren't you once a member of the Defiant Dragons, too? How can you go along with this?
Nahyuta:
...I am simply following the orders that Her Eminence has handed down.
Apollo:
No, it can't be as simple as that. Listen, Nahyuta. There's something I want to talk to you about. Hey! You're not getting away this time! We need to talk.
Nahyuta:
.........*sigh* I see there is no reasoning with you. Very well, then. Speak.
Examine
Protesters
Athena:
Look at all these people! They've got the whole temple surrounded.
Phoenix:
And it looks like Datz is fanning the flames. The police are going to really have their hands full with this many protesters.
Apollo:
This whole thing is like a powder keg waiting to go off. We should keep our distance for now.
Talk
Dhurke
Apollo:
Nahyuta, do you really have to serve as prosecutor on Dhurke's case?
Apollo:
I mean, prosecuting your own flesh and blood... It's just not right.
Nahyuta:
Again with this drivel? Your ethical standards are not the be-all, end-all of the world around you.
Apollo:
(I'm not getting into another debate with him.) .........Nahyuta, did you know that Dhurke is sick?
Nahyuta:
What?
Apollo:
He apparently doesn't have that much longer to live. If found guilty, he probably wouldn't even make it until his execution day.
Nahyuta:
What are you talking about?
Apollo:
Knowing this, are you still prepared to send an already dying man to his grave?
Nahyuta:
.........
Apollo:
Well?
Nahyuta:
...I...
Apollo:
Enough with the zen monk act, Nahyuta. Tell me how you really feel.
Nahyuta:
.........Mr. Justice. Each person is born with a role to fulfill. And I... must fulfill mine.
Apollo;
Well, I'm not convinced that taking Dhurke to trial is a part of your lot in life.
Nahyuta:
.........
Apollo:
As for why you've been at Ga'ran's every beck and call... ...I think I might have the answer.
Amara (appears after "Dhurke")
Apollo:
Nahyuta. You know the truth about your mother, don't you? About how the former queen is still alive and being held somewhere.
Nahyuta:
So Dhurke told you, did he... Yes, it's true. My mother was spirited away to some remote corner of this kingdom... ...to keep her safe from harm.
Apollo:
Safe from harm? But Dhurke said the Ga'ran regime is holding her captive.
Nahyuta:
No, they are keeping her safe.
Apollo:
So you don't know where Amara is being held?
Nahyuta:
I only know that it is some secluded hideaway where visitors are not allowed. I have heard she leads a simple life, akin to that of monastic disciples.
Apollo:
(Sure sounds like she's being held captive to me.) Listen, Nahyuta... Aren't you really doing the queen's bidding... ...because she's holding Amara captive?
Nahyuta:
.........
Apollo:
And this whole thing with Dhurke... You know he didn't really kill Inga, don't you?
Nahyuta:
..................
Apollo:
Dhurke doesn't have much longer to live, so I want to help him however I can. This time, it's our turn...
Apollo:
*sniffle* *hiccup* *hiccup*
Nahyuta:
You... You could've been killed... But you risked your life... to save us... Why...?
Dhurke:
What a silly question. What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand?
Apollo:
It's our turn to help Dhurke however we can.
Nahyuta:
.................................... .........What you speak of... is futile.
Apollo:
!
Nahyuta:
.........Let it go, and move on. The guilty verdict... The hopelessness... You must resign yourself to it all. Clinging to false hope now will only serve to magnify your future despair. So let it go... and move on...
Apollo:
...Nahyuta. (Are you really going to just roll over on this?)
Nahyuta:
...I've no more time for idle chatter. I must prepare for tomorrow's trial. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Apollo:
.........
Present
Dhurke's Law Book
Nahyuta:
That's...
Apollo:
The rebels' "Mark of the Dragon." It symbolizes a person's opposition to the Defense Culpability Act.
Nahyuta:
You seek to argue with me about the legal system? ...If so, you're wasting your breath. Lawyers and prosecutors do not lay down the law; they merely follow it. The laws decreed by our sovereign are absolute. There is no room for debate.
Apollo:
So "let it go, and move on," right? Why is that your only answer to everything?
After clearing all Talk options:
Athena:
Apollo. I sensed a whirlpool of emotions coming from within Prosecutor Sahdmadhi just now. Anger, shock, bewilderment... ...and an icy sorrow, as deep and dark as an abyss.
Apollo:
Yeah, I picked up on that, too. Looks like Dhurke really won't be the only one who will need my help tomorrow.
Phoenix:
...I think it's about time to pay Queen Ga'ran another visit... ...and ask her about her sister Amara.
Talk
Any ideas?
Athena:
I didn't know Dhurke was sick. What's wrong with him? I mean, he looked fine to me.
Apollo:
...I really don't know. The Dhurke I remember would go out hunting in the middle of winter... ...while everyone around him was dropping like flies with the flu and whatnot.
Athena:
...............
Apollo:
..................
Phoenix:
........................
Apollo:
.........Come on everyone, cheer up! The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles, right?
Phoenix:
...Apollo, you don't have to put on a brave face for--
Apollo:
No! I'm fine! Besides, Dhurke will have his day in court. I won't let this get me down.
What to do
Athena:
So you don't know Queen Amara at all, Apollo? I thought that since you used to live with Dhurke, that maybe you had met her.
Apollo:
Dhurke escaped with Amara twenty-three or so years ago, so I was still just an infant. Even if I had met her, I wouldn't have remembered it.
Athena:
I guess not. But that means you may have been cared for by a queen. And if you had been, then... 
Apollo:
Th-Then what?
Athena:
You would've turned out... I don't know... better?
Apollo:
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?
May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber
Phoenix:
Hm? The royal guard isn't around.
???:
That is utter... utter... hooey! You cannot continue to deceive the people like that!
???:
...Rayfa. Justice is much more than simply speaking the truth.
Apollo:
Is that Princess Rayfa and Queen Ga'ran over there?
Rayfa:
Y-You deceived me, too, Mother! How can I ever believe a word you say again?! You... You... nincompoop! .........Ah.
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence... ...I, uh, couldn't help but overhear...
Rayfa:
Nnnnnnnnnnnngh... You impudent--!!
*ka-tonk!*
Phoenix:
Oww!!!
Apollo:
Are you okay, Mr. Wright? I can't believe she actually punched you...
Phoenix:
...Yeah, I'm used to it by now.
Athena:
What's the matter with the princess?
Apollo:
It sounded like she was arguing with her mother.
Phoenix:
.........Maybe it has something to do with this picture. Rayfa said she had to ask her mother about some secret or another as soon as she saw it.
Apollo:
So then... ...does that mean that Princess Rayfa knows what really happened? That Amara wasn't assassinated, and is still very much alive?
Phoenix:
It would seem so. And she doesn't seem to be taking Ga'ran's lies very well. But that's no surprise, considering how much Rayfa reveres her mother.
Athena:
That would definitely cause her a great deal of anguish and sadness.
???:
Eavesdropping, are we? How very rude.
Ga'ran: 
Hm? You there. Are you not Dhurke's son?
Apollo:
Oh, um, nice to meet you, Your Eminence. We're actually here to speak with you, if you could spare a moment.
Examine
Throne
Apollo:
............
Phoenix:
Apollo? What are you doing? This is the queen's audience chamber. You can't snoop around in here.
Apollo:
Oh, right. Sorry! (I wonder what it'd be like to sit there with Athena and Mr. Wright groveling at my feet... No! Stop! I can't let myself think about that sort of thing!)
Talk
Amara's alive?
Apollo:
Your Eminence, Dhurke told me about Amara. About how she's still alive, that is.
Ga'ran:
...We know not of what you speak.
Apollo:
After Dhurke learned Amara was still alive, he rescued her, and they ran off together. But she was captured and remains captive in a secret location to this day. As for Nahyuta doing your bidding, it's only because Amara's life's in your hands.
Ga'ran:
Ho ho ho. What an active imagination you have.
Royal Guard:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! A lawyer AND a comedian! How droll!
Apollo:
(Wh-Whoa. Where'd THEY come from? Anyway! If she's going to play dumb, I'll just have to jog her memory with some evidence!)
Amara's alive!
Apollo:
So then, you admit that Amara's still alive?
Ga'ran:
.........Yes. She is under our protection in a safe location.
Apollo:
(I think you mean "being held prisoner.") ...And where is she being kept?
Ga'ran:
Ho ho ho. Now why would we tell the son of a traitor that?
Apollo:
(Guess she has a point there.)
Ga'ran:
Now, heed our warning, Horned Devil. It would not be wise to inform the people that Amara yet lives. It would only serve to plunge public order into chaos.
Apollo:
I have no intention of doing that. (Besides, there are real terrorists out there who might try to kill her.)
Ga'ran:
...Good. Now, there was something we have been meaning to ask you. Do you know what has become of the Founder's Orb?
The Founder's Orb (appears after "Amara's alive!")
Ga'ran:
The Founders Orb went missing after Dhurke took it into the tomb. As his son, we thought you might know something of its current whereabouts.
Apollo:
I knew it. I suppose I should thank you for that free running tour of Khura'in.
Ga'ran:
...That was the royal guards' own doing.
Apollo:
(Nice try, lady. But now you're definitely not getting the orb, ever.) Why do you want the orb so badly, anyway?
Ga'ran:
Because... it would be most dangerous in the wrong hands. It must be recovered.
Phoenix:
Is the legend true? Can the orb really impart spiritual power? Are you worried that someone could overthrow you with it?
Ga'ran:
The Holy Mother's power is without equal. Should Her Holiness once again return to our world... ...she could conceivably bestow great power upon the one who unlocked the orb's secret.
Phoenix:
I guess it makes sense, considering spirit channeling is a fact of life here.
Ga'ran:
...So we ask you, Horned Devil. Did you receive the Founder's Orb from Dhurke?
Apollo:
...Does it look like I did?
Ga'ran:
...So you like to play games, do you? ...Royal guard!
Royal Guard:
Yes, Your Eminence!
Ga'ran:
Search this devil, and his belongings!
Apollo:
What?
Royal Guard:
At once, Your Eminence! Don't move!!! You're only making this haaaaaarder on yourseeelf!!!
Apollo:
Yikes! Hey, cut it out! Argh! What the--?!
Athena:
Eeeeeek! Apollo! Don't strip here!
Royal Guard:
Stop resisting!!! Just submit to our strip search alreeeeeady!!!
Apollo:
N-No, wait! Hey! Cut it out! Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh! .................. (Rest in pieces, my poor, tattered dignity.)
Royal Guard:
There's no sign of the Founder's Orb, Your Eminence!
Ga'ran:
.........So, you have hidden it somewhere. Heh. No matter. We shall recover it one way or another once you are found guilty of abetting the accused.
Apollo:
(Dhurke was right. She really is bent on getting the orb.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Ga'ran:
What have we here?
Apollo:
It's the attorney's badge used by lawyers like me back home.
Ga'ran: 
Well, in this country, lawyers are a loathsome breed. And we would advise you not to needlessly advertise your place among their ranks. For even now, the bad karma Dhurke has engendered brings woe to your kind. It is a simple matter of cause and effect.
Apollo:
(Yeah, an effect you caused by enacting the Defense Culpability Act.)
Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo
Ga'ran:
His own ill will was visited upon him. So it is within the cycle of karma. Others might call it divine retribution -- the punishment of the gods.
Apollo:
You don't seem particularly sad, even though it was your own husband.
Ga'ran:
We were betrayed by the man we had called husband. Moreover, we are the Grand Priestess, summoner of spirits from the Twilight Realm. For us, death is not the end, for we can still speak with those who have passed.
Apollo:
(I guess being a spirit-channeling queen gives you a different take on life and death.)
Woman's Photo (after clearing "Amara's alive?" Talk option)
Apollo:
Your Eminence, I ask that you take a look at this photo.
Ga'ran:
Why, that's--!
Apollo:
It's a photo of Amara. And here you can see a law book bearing the mark of the Defiant Dragons. I believe you know what that means.
Ga'ran:
.................. ..........Very well. Royal guard, stand down.
Royal Guard:
Yes, Your Eminence! Your wish is our command!
Ga'ran:
It seems there is no need to perpetuate this charade any longer. We shall speak... of all we know.
Changes "Amara's alive?" Talk option to "Amara's alive!"
Dhurke's Law Book
Ga'ran:
To burn such a mark upon a sacred text of the law... He will surely be visited by what he has wrought. And to think he once called himself a man of the law.
Apollo:
I think it's just his way of objecting to the DC Act.
Ga'ran:
Yet that act is but an objection to his falsified evidence. How appalling that even now he recognizes no responsibility and knows no shame.
Anything else
Apollo:
So, I was wondering if...
Ga'ran:
We have no intention of bestowing any information upon you or any other lawyer.
Apollo:
(Guess someone doesn't like to play nice with others.)
After clearing all Talk options:
???:
Mother!
Apollo:
Looks like the princess is back. 
Rayfa:
I took a stroll to try to calm myself, but... I still find this situation unacceptable. The people must be informed about Queen Amara!
Apollo:
! (So she DOES know about that!)
Ga'ran:
Rayfa, you do not yet possess a clear grasp of how a government and its people interact. There will always be secrets that must be kept from the ignorant masses.
Rayfa:
You have little faith in our people, Mother. But it is the Royal Priestess's duty to always speak the truth. And as such I cannot remain silent! I will not!
Ga'ran:
Hah. The truth, you say? Your mind has been poisoned by the Barbed One.
Phoenix:
It was an honor and a pleasure, Your Eminence.
Ga'ran:
...We must speak with our child. It is a mother's duty to discipline her child, after all. Now, if you would excuse us.
Apollo:
(Discipline? Coming from her, I don't like the sound of that at all...)
Phoenix:
Well, Apollo, let's head back to the safe house for now.
Apollo:
Good idea. We need to go over what we've found and collect our thoughts.
May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices
Edgeworth:
...Ah, you're back.
Athena:
Thank you for holding down the fort, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. Sorry it took so long. Hope you weren't too bored.
Edgeworth:
...I watched "The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm" while you were gone. And my verdict is... it's an outrage! Especially its theme song. Even worse, the people here believe it's an original, Khura'inese show. Can you believe it! I've already spoke about it at length with Mr. Are'bal here, and he...
Apollo:
(I'm not sure what he's babbling about, but at least it seems he wasn't bored.)
Phoenix:
Moving along to things that actually matter... We've gathered about all the information and evidence we can concerning this case.
Phoenix:
I think it's time we go over everything we've learned so far.
Examine
Anything
Phoenix:
...Apollo. We probably shouldn't search the place while Datz is gone. Besides, we need to go over the case for tomorrow.
Athena:
What's with you recently? It's like you want to spend every free minute we have snooping.
Apollo:
(But don't you get the urge to look at everything you can sometimes, too?)
Talk
About Inga's murder
Phoenix:
The orb trial... Maya's abduction... And the murder of the mastermind behind it all, Justice Minister Inga... It's a lot to consider. Think you have all the facts straight in your head?
Apollo:
Yep, I've got it covered, Mr. Wright. It's the truth about what really went down that's going to be the problem.
Athena:
Yeah, it's like the more we learn about this case, the less we understand.
Phoenix:
I agree. There's a deep darkness enveloping this case. I'm almost afraid of what we will find once we lift that black veil. Suffice to say, the real killer is certainly waiting underneath.
Apollo:
(The real killer, huh... Now that's the million dollar question.)
Phoenix:
Who killed Inga, and why? Think Apollo. Who would you say had a motive to commit this crime?
Apollo:
Umm...
Athena:
I, for one, am drawing a complete blank.
Phoenix:
I want to know how the killer slipped into the tomb, killed Inga, and slipped back out... ...without ever being seen. That's a bona fide locked-room mystery right there.
Apollo:
Well, we've collected plenty of evidence and statements. I just hope the rest comes out in court. It'll be a thinner tightrope than usual, that's for sure.
Amara's assassination
Phoenix:
This case has one big fly in the ointment. In order to prove Dhurke completely innocent... ...we'll also have to exonerate him of the crime committed twenty-three years ago.
Apollo:
Amara's supposed assassination...
Athena:
Right. We know Amara's still alive... ...but Dhurke could still be charged with plotting to kill her.
Apollo:
He couldn't discover the truth-- even after over two decades of investigating. So our biggest hurdle is going to be the complete lack of evidence. The fire made sure of that.
Athena:
Mr. Wright, have you ever won a case without any evidence?
Phoenix:
No, that's one thing I've never done before.
Apollo:
A trial unprecedented even in the decorated annals of the Wright Anything Agency... (Still, I can't help but wonder... Was there really no evidence left behind?)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
You flash that badge like a pro now. And with such confidence, too. I can really feel it.
Apollo:
R-Really?
Phoenix:
...Sure. Take Trucy's case, or that civil trial yesterday. You really came into your own during both of them.
Apollo:
Eheh... Heh heh heh. (I can feel my cheeks betraying me...)
Athena:
You'd better not be thinking of starting your own firm, Apollo.
Apollo:
What? No, of course not. (I'm probably not ready for that, anyway.)
Pink Butterfly Pendant, Woman's Photo, or Amara's Assassination File
Phoenix:
Amara... She's still alive.
Apollo:
But she's basically being held prisoner somewhere.
Phoenix:
This puts Dhurke at a distinct disadvantage. ...Not to mention us, too.
Apollo:
And Nahyuta is under Ga'ran's thumb because of all this as well.
Phoenix:
Yep. It's a problem all right, and it's not like we can just go and rescue Amara. There must be something we can do...
Athena:
We'll just have to pin our hopes on Dhurke's revolution!
Apollo:
So, basically, the fates of Amara and Nahyuta... ...depend entirely on our ability to beat the charges against Dhruke tomorrow.
Dhurke's Law Book or Dhurke's Badge
Phoenix:
What would you do if the Defense Culpability Act was established back home?
Apollo:
What would I do? That's a good question.
Athena:
What are you worried about, Apollo? You'd always have a job as Trucy's assistant.
Apollo:
Uh-huh... And what about you, Athena? Couldn't you become a therapist?
Athena:
Hmm... I don't know if I could do it for a living...
Phoenix:
I'd probably go back to playing piano.
Apollo:
.....................
Athena:
...............
Phoenix:
Hey! What are those looks for?!
Anything else
Phoenix:
Just because you don't know something, doesn't mean that I do, Apollo. That's an important lesson for you to learn.
Apollo:
(In other words, this didn't ring any bells.)
After clearing all Talk options:
Phoenix:
...Oh, and we can't forget about the Defense Culpability Act. "...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty." In short, if Dhurke is found guilty, and is sentenced to death... ...we'll likely join him in a very public execution.
Apollo:
Y-Yeah...
Athena:
Beat the charges or die... What kind of crazy, upside-down legal system is this, anyway?!
Phoenix:
...Don't worry. I can't ask someone as young as you to risk your life, Athena. So tomorrow, it'll just be me and Apollo on the courtroom floor. But you can support us by watching from the gallery.
Athena:
What?! No... I wanna help! I'm part of the agency, too, after all!
Phoenix:
...Sorry, but this is a direct order from your boss. Plus, there's Prosecutor Blackquill to think of. He said he's use me for sword practice if I put you in harm's way.
Athena:
Nrrgh... Simon... Well, at least promise me this, you two. Promise me you'll make it back alive!
Apollo:
Ha... Ha ha... Make it back alive... huh...
Phoenix:
What's with that face, Apollo? You'll never inspire confidence in your client like that. And it'll play right into the prosecution's hands. Remember, "the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles."
Apollo:
You're right! Even when it seems hopeless, or when there's not a shred of evidence to be found... ... we can never let it show on our faces... right? (But will I actually be able to do that tomorrow? When push comes to shove, will I be able to force my biggest smile?)
