Wright Anything Agency
Trucy:
Hey, hey, Apollo!
Apollo:
What?
Trucy:
Um, well, you know... ...Um, actually, nothing. I mean, something. ...Or maybe not.
Apollo:
Out with it. The suspense is giving me an ulcer.
Trucy:
Well, you know, the trial today? I was thinking... If you gave it a score, what score would you give it?
Apollo:
Score? Um, gee... I guess I would... um, or maybe... well... ...Bah. I'm just as bad as you.
Trucy:
See? It's so... so vague!
Apollo:
Clearly. Machi avoided a guilty verdict, which is something. Though I can't say I'm any less confused about the case.
Daryan:
I asked Interpol about that number. I'm sure you'll find their answer intriguing. "IPXX314206"... The agent registered under that number... ...was Romein LeTouse.
Apollo:
And the victim, Mr. LeTouse... Who would have guessed he was actually an undercover Interpol agent!? ...What a mess. And we don't have any idea what he was investigating.
Trucy:
Well, true, but we know who shot him now! Lamiroir told the whole court!
Lamiroir:
Wait! That voice just now... ............ It was him. I am sure of it. That voice I heard, talking to Mr. LeTouse... when I heard the gunshots fired. It was him! It was Mr. Daryan!
Trucy:
It's another mystery, Apollo! I love mysteries.
Apollo:
I don't. Speaking of mysteries, what's Mr. Wright up to? I wouldn't mind asking his opinion.
Trucy:
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Daddy around.
Apollo:
What, is he some kind of stray that just wanders in and out at will?
Trucy:
I wouldn't say that, but he has been going out a lot. Some "top secret mission", he said.
Apollo:
Top secret...?
Trucy:
Anyway, you can't just rely on him to save the day! And you've got me to help you. We'll be fine!
Apollo:
Fine... right. Well, time's a-wasting, as they say. Let's investigate.
Trucy:
That's the spirit!
Examine
Bookshelf
Apollo:
There are several books of magic mixed in with the legal books on the shelves. I dusted them recently. Nothing like the gleam of clean books!
Charley the plant
Apollo:
Mr. Charley, the potted plant. Huh? His leaves are looking a little... brown.
Trucy:
Good morning, Mr. Charley! Ack! M-Mr. Charley! Your leaves!
Apollo:
Maybe you weren't giving him enough water?
Trucy:
No, no, it must be stress. He's worried about the new recruit at the office.
Apollo:
Hey, don't blame it on me! You are watering him, right?
Trucy:
It was Daddy's turn to water him this week... Ack!
Apollo:
Mr. Wright has been away on his "top secret mission", no?
Trucy:
I'm sorry Mr. Charley, this is all my fault. I'll water you soon, promise!
Hula hoop
Apollo:
You know, that ring kind of gets in the way. Our client the other day tripped on it and fell on the floor.
Trucy:
...Sending my ring rolling out the door! You know how long it took me to find it?
Apollo:
You know how long it took to calm down the client? And in the end, they walked out without hiring us. Could you clean up a bit?
Trucy:
But don't you think the props give the office a festive, fun-filled mood?
Apollo:
I'm not sure law offices have to be festive and fun-filled.
Trucy:
Apollo! This is the "Wright Anything Agency"! As CEO, I want an office that says we know how to have fun!
Apollo:
(I guess it is her office... isn't it?)
Magic split box
Apollo:
A strange, split box leers at me from the wall. No matter how many times I see that there, it still strikes me as... odd.
Trucy:
Really? I guess I've gotten used to it, after growing up with it always around the house.
Apollo:
What kind of a home did you grow up in!?
Trucy:
I'd hide in there when we played hide 'n' seek! You just get in, slide the sections around, and you're impossible to find!
Apollo:
I bet you would be...
Photograph
Apollo:
A faded photograph showing one of Trucy's favorite magicians. She talks to it daily for good luck, I hear.
Trucy:
Ack! I almost forgot! Umm... I hope I become a famous Grand Magician! Oh, and I hope Apollo becomes an Ace Attorney! ...There! All done.
Apollo:
(I suppose if you're going to talk to inanimate objects, a photo isn't so bad.)
Piano
Apollo:
How is your magic act coming along?
Trucy:
Well, I've been working on my "cups &amp; balls" routine.
Apollo:
Is that the one where the ball moves from under one cup to the other?
Trucy:
That's right! The very same! Here, watch... First, I put one of the cups over the ball... then I snap my fingers! Ta da! The ball's under the other cup!
Apollo:
...It's not there.
Trucy:
...... ...Watch me pull something out of my magic panties!
Apollo:
Nice try.
Trucy:
Guess I know what I'll be doing tonight. Practicing! You can be my audience, Apollo!
Apollo:
(*sigh*)
Silk hat
Apollo:
That's one of those hats you pull things out of, right?
Trucy:
Of course! My hat's like a little universe! Bigger on the inside than on the outside!
Apollo:
Hmm... That reminds me of a sci-fi show I used to watch.
Trucy:
Incidentally, my pocket is a little universe, too! And my panties, and...
Apollo:
I get the idea.
Spaghetti
Apollo:
I've seen some restaurants that set out real food to show what's on the menu.
Trucy:
I have, too! But I noticed something strange... One time, there was a sandwich without any lettuce! Like it had disappeared... by magic!
Apollo:
...I'm sure someone just swiped the lettuce and ate it.
Trucy:
Wait, that sandwich... You didn't...! Apollo, you shouldn't eat sample food, no matter how hungry you are!
Apollo:
Just how hard up do you think I am!?
Table
Trucy:
Well, how about some tea? Here you go!
Apollo:
Um, thanks. That's nice. ...But this is not the time to be drinking tea!
Trucy:
That's right, we have to get investigating! Ack, that was a close call! We almost relaxed!
Talk
Daryan did it
Apollo:
Lamiroir dropped a bomb in court today... "It was Daryan"...
Trucy:
Lamiroir said she's never forgotten a voice, right? That's so cool!
Apollo:
Um, I guess.
Trucy:
What's that called again? Um... Elephant ears...? I bet that's what they're called...
Apollo:
...Somehow I don't think that means what you think it means. ...And she has to be wrong, this time.
Trucy:
Wrong? Why?
Apollo:
I mean, look... Those gunshots were right during the concert!
Trucy:
That's right! I was burning up the dance floor at the time.
Apollo:
Right... Did you happen to look up on stage? Maybe... at Daryan, even?
Trucy:
You bet I did! He is one of the Gavinners's guitarists after all! He's so cool! ...Oh.
Apollo:
Right. All the Gavinners have a rock-solid alibi. He couldn't have shot Mr. LeTouse backstage.
Trucy:
But... Lamiroir heard him, didn't she? She heard Daryan backstage... Right...?
Apollo:
(Somebody's either wrong, or lying very badly here...)
Agent LeTouse
Apollo:
An Interpol agent... hmm.
Trucy:
I was wondering, what is "Interpol" anyway?
Apollo:
Huh? Interpol? They're the guys who catch international criminals.
Trucy:
Why can't they just call them "International Police" instead of making up some silly name?
Apollo:
Yeah... ...Anyway, you think he was investigating Lamiroir?
Trucy:
Whaaaa--!? Why would anyone do that? She's not a criminal! She couldn't be!
Apollo:
Don't be fooled by appearances is all I'm saying.
Trucy:
But remember I'm a magician, Apollo! I can spot a palmed coin at fifty paces!
Apollo:
If only it were that easy. ...In any case, we know he was working on something.
Trucy:
I wonder if it was something that has something to do with something. That something being our case. The last something, I mean.
Apollo:
Something like that. ...Frankly, the whole thing is making my head hurt. (What was Mr. LeTouse up to?)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Trucy:
That again? You sure like your attorney's badge. Still, I'm afraid our clients are getting tired of it...
Apollo:
...Well I'm not. So there.
Anything else
Trucy:
I'm not sure about that, sorry. I was ripping up the dance floor at the time of the shooting, after all.
After clearing all Talk options:
???:
Ahhh ha ha ha ha haa!
Apollo:
......
Trucy:
......
Apollo:
Um, Trucy? Was that another one of your tricks?
Trucy:
It wasn't me! I can't even make Mr. Hat laugh like that!
???:
...Wherever the mundane gives way to miracles, a word is whispered... Gramarye!
Trucy:
Hey! The other day...
Trucy:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Apollo:
Who's there!?
Trucy:
We... didn't just imagine that, did we?
Apollo:
He was wearing a silk hat. ...Friend of yours?
Trucy:
Hardly!
???:
We meet again!
Apollo:
Ah, um, nice to meet you. Who... are you? (And could you please stop smirking like that?)
Trucy:
Ah. Ahhhhhhh! It's you!!! Uncle Valant!
Apollo:
Uncle Valant...? He's your uncle!?
Trucy:
No, silly! It's the Great Gramarye, Valant Gramarye! The Grand Magician!
Valant:
Yes, it is I, the Great Valant Gramarye. As seen on television.
Apollo:
(And could you please stop smirking like that?)
Valant:
It's been a while, Miss Trucy. Seven years to be exact! My, how you've grown!
Trucy:
Good to see you again, Uncle Valant! You... look exactly the same!
Apollo:
Um, I hate to intrude, but... What is a Great Magician doing paying us a visit?
Valant:
I believe it was you who wished to see me? So, be quick with your questions! And do not quail, quake, or quiver. I am quite tame. Though my stardom may sear the sight... I'm quite down to earth when need calls.
Apollo:
(He does have a certain aura to him, it's true.)
Trucy:
Let's ask him about the case, Apollo!
Apollo:
(His "aura" sure isn't lost on our magician-in-the-making. She's practically drooling with enthusiasm.)
Trucy:
After all... ...Uncle Valant's one of Daddy's best friends! That's why I call him "uncle".
Apollo:
Wh-What? Daddy... you mean Mr. Wright...?
Trucy:
No, I mean... My real Daddy.
Apollo:
...! (Trucy's real father!?)
Talk
Troupe Gramarye
Trucy:
Wait, Apollo... Don't tell me you don't know about Troupe Gramarye?
Apollo:
Troupe Grammarie... huh? No. But it does sound kind of familiar...
Valant:
Oh, lost life! Lamentably listless lad! To not know of the greatest troupe of magicians on the planet!
Apollo:
(Valant Gramarye... The name began to surface in my mind. It was a name I'd heard on television as a child.)
Trucy:
You bet you've heard the name! He made a cruise ship disappear, and blew up an amusement park... ...Oh, and he made all this gold disappear from a safe! And then escaped from a high security prison!
Apollo:
Um... ...You said he is a magician?
Valant:
I open the locks to hearts chained... by mediocrity. This is the true miracle of Troupe Gramarye.
Apollo:
...Wait.
Trucy:
What, Apollo?
Apollo:
I do remember... seeing you on television... a long time ago. Weren't you with someone else...? Like, a duo?
Trucy:
A duo?
Apollo:
Yeah, you had a partner. "Something Gramarye"...
Valant:
Yes... Zak. Zak Gramarye. A masterful maker of magic, a capable crafter of shining showmanship!
Trucy:
......
Apollo:
? Why's everyone so quiet?
Trucy:
Daddy...
Apollo:
Daddy...? (Huh!? Oh, no way!)
Trucy's father
Valant:
Once upon a time, the Troupe Gramarye included two Grand Magicians. Myself, Valant Gramarye, and my partner... Zak Gramarye!
Apollo:
And this Zak was...?
Trucy:
He was my real Daddy.
Apollo:
(Trucy's father, a magician... I guess it makes sense.) ...I had no idea.
Trucy:
There wasn't much point in talking about it... Not now that he's gone.
Apollo:
...Oh, I'm sorry.
Trucy:
No, it's OK. I'm not lonely. I've got my Daddy, after all! And you make me laugh, Apollo.
Apollo:
Glad that I'm good for comic relief, at least.
Trucy:
...Not that I see Daddy around much these days.
Present
Anything
Valant:
What's this? You would ask me for a miracle? Free of fee? Then thy wish be granted! Thy will be done! Thy evidence evicted into the ether!
Apollo:
Ack! No evicting, please! (...Are all magicians like this, I wonder?)
After clearing all Talk options:
Valant:
...Ach, I've been remiss in remembering my reasons for my visit.
Apollo:
Reasons?
Valant:
Two, in fact! The first being, of course... ...to see you, Miss Trucy.
Trucy:
You don't know how happy I am to see you again, Uncle Valant!
Valant:
I'm sure you are.
Apollo:
...Not one for modesty, are you?
Valant:
When I encountered you at the Coliseum... the first time in seven years... ...I could fain contain my emotions! I wept oceans! And to learn you now defend that poor pianist, that blinded boy! Twas a hot topic of talk amongst the staff, you know. And defend him you did!
Trucy:
Eh heh. Well, it wasn't all my doing.
Apollo:
Um, I'm his defense attorney, actually.
Valant:
My other reason for coming here today... was this.
Trucy:
That's... a video tape?
Valant:
Quite so. A recording of the concert, no less. I've brought it for you, Trucy, on behalf of Troupe Gramarye. Will you watch it?
Sugar, Sugar...O that night, in your embrace.
When you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.
Pleasure...But a fleeting melody
It wraps itself around me,And now through the air I fly.
Woh... Woh...
Burning on in my heart. Fire.Burn my love away. All away.
Like a bullet of love. Fire.Take my life away. All away.
Guitar, Guitar...Up together to the sky.
Trucy:
Wow... It's almost as good as it was live. So... what's the word? Mysterious...
Apollo:
(There are more mysterious things than her song going on... Way more mysterious...)
Valant:
Ah ha ha ha ha...!
Apollo:
(This Valant Gramarye has good reasons to be here today... But I wonder what his "reasons" were to be at that concert?)
Video Tape received from Valant.
Present
Video Tape
Leads to:
"So, I was wondering... That stunt in the middle of the song there..."
Apollo:
So, I was wondering... That stunt in the middle of the song there...
Trucy:
I didn't see a stunt...
Apollo:
What about Lamiroir vanishing and reappearing!?
Trucy:
Oh, that? I guess I'm so used to seeing that happen I didn't even notice.
Apollo:
(So young to be so jaded...)
Valant:
A simple slight-of-hand [sic], a petit prestidigitation. A modicum of magic from me... to you.
Trucy:
So that's why you were at the concert!
Valant:
Yes. I was there to watch my trick take to the air...
Apollo:
So you're the one who knows how it was all done.
Valant:
Of course. I am like a deity, with the stage as my domain! I suffer no mystery upon those floodlit boards not grasped tightly twixt my fingers. It is a potent, primeval power I possess.
Apollo:
Um... Well... Do you think you could... ...tell me how it was done!?
Trucy:
Hey now!
Apollo:
Trucy...?
Trucy:
That's like, totally against the rules, Apollo!
Apollo:
Not during a murder investigation, it's not!
Valant:
Mais non, for my illusions are mine alone, m'sieur. Also...
Apollo:
Also what?
Valant:
Recall that the terrible occurrence happened later. Well after my illusion entranced the audience.
Apollo:
Oh.
Valant:
Don't even ask. I won't answer.
Trucy:
Too bad for you, Apollo!
Apollo:
(Grr. Whose side are you on?)
Valant:
...I, Valant Gramarye, now make my leave, Miss Trucy.
Trucy:
There's no need to rush, Uncle Valant! You should stay a while!
Valant:
I am afraid I cannot. I may not. I shall not. I have been asked to assist with an analysis and so I shall slink back to the scene.
Apollo:
So... you'll be at the concert venue today?
Valant:
Correct. If you would call on me, come to the Coliseum! See you later, crocodile.
Apollo:
(With a whir of his cloak, and a wink of his eye... ...he turned and walked out through the door. Normally.)
Trucy:
Well, there you go, Apollo! Let's get cracking!
Apollo:
...Right. (Valant Gramarye... I've got a few more things to ask him. Foremost among them, that bit of magic that made Lamiroir disappear... ...And how he knows Trucy, and her "real" father...!)
Examine
Photograph
Apollo:
So this photo is of your father, Trucy?
Trucy:
Someday, I'll be as good a magician as Zak Gramarye! You'll see! 
Apollo:
(No wonder she's so devoted to her art...)
Trucy:
You should have seen him on stage, Apollo! He made things disappear right and left! Poof poof poof! Until he even made himself disappear! Cool, huh?
Apollo:
Uh, yeah... (Is that how it really happened?)
July 9Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Apollo:
(Machi may not be guilty, but he's still a suspect.)
Trucy:
But they don't have any decisive evidence!
Apollo:
Yeah, but only someone as small as him could have gotten out of that room.
Trucy:
Right... the air vent.
Apollo:
And... he lied.
Trucy:
Lied?
Apollo:
(Machi Tobaye can see...)
Machi:
....................
Trucy:
Ah! Machi!
Apollo:
Speak of the devil.
Machi:
....................
Trucy:
He looks like he's doing OK!
Apollo:
I forget. Why did we come here? It's not like we can talk to him or anything.
Trucy:
Words are overrated! Feelings are what matter, Apollo.
Apollo:
It's kinda hard to build a court case on feelings. But, since we're here, anyway. Might as well get what I want to say off my chest.
Trucy:
If you need someone to complain to, I'll listen...
Apollo:
(I think she's actually worried for me...)
Machi:
.....................
Examine
Security camera
Apollo:
That security camera is looking at me. Why do I feel this sudden urge to make a silly face?
Security guard
Apollo:
A security guard. He stands here, watching this room. His eyes when he looks at Machi are gentle. Maybe he has a kid the same age.
Talk
The trial today
Trucy:
So, what did you think of the trial today?
Machi:
.....................
Trucy:
...Whew. I'm glad he doesn't understand English after all. If he did, he would have been scared out of his mind by that trial.
Apollo:
Hey, all's well that ends well. You have to be more goal oriented. If he's not guilty, we win.
Trucy:
No, if he's innocent, we win. Machi might not understand English, but I bet he gets that better than you do.
Machi:
.....................
BRACELET THUMPS
Apollo:
...! (Huh...?)
Lamiroir's testimony
Trucy:
I'm glad Lamiroir testified! What a great person. She even got Machi off the hook by naming another suspect!
Apollo:
Daryan of the Gavinners... The detective. I wonder if Machi knows what happened?
Trucy:
?
Apollo:
I mean, if he could follow how the trial went at all. If no one told him there's a new suspect, how would he know?
BRACELET THUMPS
Apollo:
Hey...
Trucy:
What is it, Apollo?
Apollo:
No... It's nothing.
Machi:
.....................
Machi's eyesight
Trucy:
So, Machi... You can see, right?
Machi:
........................
Trucy:
Machi can see, and Lamiroir can't... The whole world's gone topsy-turvy!
Machi:
........................
Trucy:
Sorry, Apollo. I don't think we're going to get any information out of Machi. ...Which makes sense.
Apollo:
(...Yeah, I guess it does...)
Present
Anything
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]...
Trucy:
I think he said... "I am sorry I cannot speak your language. You are very beautiful, fair maiden."
Apollo:
...This is why I never trust a translator.
After clearing "The trial today" and "Lamiroir's testimony" Talk options:
Apollo:
...I must be imagining it.
Trucy:
Imagining what, Apollo?
Apollo:
It's just, I couldn't help but feel that... I dunno. Machi... ...He doesn't understand what we're saying, right?
Trucy:
How could he? He's a young Borginian! He doesn't speak English.
Apollo:
Yeah, but my bracelet is reacting to him.
Trucy:
Huh? Maybe it's malfunctioning? Or it's scared, because you keep making those "I'm so mad" faces.
Apollo:
Was I that bad? (Machi lied about not being able to see... But what if that's not all he lied about?)
Trucy:
If you're curious about it there's only one thing to do. You should ask him.
Apollo:
(I think it'll take something big to get to him... Some kind of undeniable evidence.) ...We'll be back, Machi.
Machi:
........................
July 9
Sunshine Coliseum
Trucy:
Woo! What a great day! It's perfect weather for sleuthing!
Apollo:
The weather matters for an investigation?
Trucy:
Don't some days just feel like "magic" days or "defense" days?
Apollo:
Um, sure. Let's get started, shall we?
Trucy:
Right on! Show us your stuff, Apollo!
Apollo:
Um, what stuff?
Trucy:
Your voice training! This is the perfect place for it!
Apollo:
I did enough at home, thanks.
Trucy:
Aw, there's no need to be shy! Keep that up and you'll never make it on the big stage!
Apollo:
I'm happy in the courtroom, thank you. I am a lawyer.
Trucy:
Then you're in luck, because it's lawyer weather today! Don't you just want to face the blue sky and shout, "Objection!"?
Apollo:
Look, the weather has nothing to do with lawyers. Let's get going already!
Examine
Blimp
Trucy:
Look! A blimp!
Apollo:
Those balloons next to it have ad banners on them.
Trucy:
Let's see... "Big Sale, All Shirts 50% Off."
Apollo:
Oh. It's an ad for the department store next door.
Blue Badger
Apollo:
What's that... creature there?
Trucy:
Oooh! That's the police mascot, the Blue Badger!
Apollo:
Eh? It's life size!
Trucy:
Haven't you seen them around town? Patrolling the streets? Yes, now even law and order has a mascot!
Apollo:
...I'd run from that thing even if I wasn't a criminal. Why does its head wobble like that when it walks? It's freaky.
Trucy:
I don't think you're showing true Blue Badger spirit, Apollo.
Coliseum building
Apollo:
Sunshine Coliseum sure is living up to its name today.
Trucy:
It's huge! And Mr. Gavin got to play on that enormous stage... I'm so jealous! Someday, I'll fight my first battle on this stage!
Apollo:
Battle?
Trucy:
Well, yeah, it's a coliseum, isn't it?
Apollo:
Um, they don't do gladiatorial contests at these places any more, Trucy.
Trucy:
Really? I had no idea! I wonder why they stopped.
Apollo:
(Sometimes I worry about her.)
Signboard
Apollo:
Look, a massive sign for the "Guilty as Charged" Tour. A giant Prosecutor Gavin stares out over the arena.
Trucy:
Ooh! Maybe I can take it to the office when they're done with it!
Apollo:
Um, where would you put it? You couldn't even get that thing through the front door.
Trucy:
Then I'll put it outside! I bet it'd be good for business!
Apollo:
Just as long as no one comes expecting us to prosecute.
Trucy:
Well, if anyone comes looking for a concert, leave it to me!
Apollo:
(Is this part of some twisted plan of hers to make her singing debut, I wonder?)
July 9
Backstage Hallway
Lamiroir:
Ah, Mr. Attorney.
Apollo:
Lamiroir! I'm sorry about today... I...
Lamiroir:
There is nothing you need to apologize for. You were merely defending Machi.
Trucy:
Um... Are you OK? Alone, I mean.
Lamiroir:
Humans are blessed with five senses. Even robbed of one, we get by. ...Though it does make being a witness rather difficult.
Trucy:
Speaking of "seeing", you knew who we were before we spotted you just now. And we weren't even talking.
Lamiroir:
...I heard your footsteps several times the day before.
Trucy:
Oh... You must have great ears!
Apollo:
(Ears that heard the crime taking place... Or so she claimed yesterday. ...But how?)
Examine
Blue Badger
Apollo:
That would be the Blue Badger, the police mascot. There's a guy outside in a giant Blue Badger costume, lumbering about... He stands out even more than those Gavinners posters.
Trucy:
It's all the same! He's the band mascot, too, you know.
Apollo:
I can't picture Prosecutor Gavin going for that kind of thing.
Trucy:
Neither can I. I'll bet there's a story there just waiting to be told!
Headset
Trucy:
That's been lying there since the day before yesterday.
Apollo:
It's small. Maybe no one's noticed it.
Trucy:
I kinda want to pick it up. It'd make a cool souvenir, don't you think?
Apollo:
(It does stick out in my mind for some reason...)
Left hallway door
Apollo:
That's the Gavinners's dressing room. They're all out on the investigation. Being backstage isn't half as glamorous without a band here.
Right hallway door
Apollo:
That's Lamiroir's dressing room... and the scene of the crime. It's kind of lightly guarded for being a crime scene.
Trucy:
I'm not complaining! Makes it easier for us to go in! And Ema gave us her OK, right? We can wander in and do as we like!
Apollo:
(How is Ema doing, anyway...? I hope she's not getting cavities from eating all those chocolate Snackoos...)
Gavinners's Dressing Room
Examine
Postcards
Apollo:
It's a stack of Lamiroir's postcards. There it is... The "landscape painter in sound"...
Trucy:
It must be hard to pretend you can see when you can't.
Apollo:
Yet the way she sings so effortlessly... you'd think she had life easy. Some people are just impressive like that.
Trucy:
You know it! It just makes me think about how much further I have to go!
Apollo:
(I hope we can solve this quickly and not add to her troubles...)
Speaker
Apollo:
The speaker here is the same as the one in Lamiroir's room. I wonder if this one was blaring as loud as hers.
Trucy:
I don't see a volume control anywhere in the room... My guess is they give all the rooms equal treatment!
Apollo:
...You mean equal punishment.
Lamiroir's Dressing Room
Examine
Air vent
Apollo:
They found Machi Tobaye's fingerprints on that air vent.
Trucy:
......
Apollo:
What's with the long face?
Trucy:
It's a little lackluster, you know.
Apollo:
Lackluster...?
Trucy:
I mean, using the air vent is so obvious! No audience is going to pay good money to see a trick like that.
Apollo:
...... Things must look different through a magician's eyes.
Trucy:
It'd be much cooler if the killer got out through that tiny window!
Apollo:
Don't go there. You'll get your head stuck.
Brooch
Apollo:
Right after the shooting took place... ...Lamiroir tried to come into the dressing room, and dropped her brooch.
Trucy:
I think that fits with the other stuff we know. Do you think the timing of when she dropped it is important?
Apollo:
Yeah... Something about it bugs me, that's for sure.
Bullet holes
Apollo:
Look at the way those bullets tore through this thick wall. That revolver really was something else.
Trucy:
I wonder if someone as little as me could even fire it?
Apollo:
Dislocating your shoulder would kind of put a crimp on your stage career.
Trucy:
Daddy always has stiff shoulders, maybe that could loosen him up!
Apollo:
Don't even mention it. I'm afraid he might go out and actually try it.
Trucy:
Nah, he doesn't have the guts to pull the trigger, I bet.
Fruit basket
Trucy:
Look! It's fruit! Fruit, Apollo! Fruit!!!
Apollo:
...I heard you the first time. It sure is a lot of fruit. I doubt anyone would miss a bit of watermelon...
Trucy:
I know, I'll make it vanish! Into my stomach!
Apollo:
Better not. They might make you pay for it. And if you have the money for that, you should probably repaint the office first.
Trucy:
Watermelons are that expensive!?
Apollo:
*shrug* These could've been imported from some exotic locale, for all we know.
(Step)ladder
Apollo:
The shooter must have used that to climb up to the vent.
Trucy:
All this tragedy, because someone left a stepladder here.
Apollo:
...I don't think Mr. LeTouse was shot because of the ladder.
Trucy:
You think it was Machi?
Apollo:
I guess... That air vent is pretty small, after all. (Does that prove he was at the scene...? Did he escape in the time between the gunshots and us opening the door?)
Poster next to TV
Apollo:
It's a poster for another show. "This Summer: A Legal Eagles Production of 'Case Closed'."
Trucy:
I looked into that performance group. Turns out they're all law enforcement-related, too. Apparently, their serious portrayal of law and order is a big draw!
Apollo:
...That sounds so boring, it's probably pretty interesting.
Trucy:
You're a complicated man, Mr. Apollo Justice.
Poster over TV
Trucy:
A Gavinners poster.
Apollo:
How many of those did they put up, anyway?
Trucy:
Prosecutor Gavin looked so cool on stage! You should learn to play the guitar, too, Apollo! You can accompany my magic act!
Apollo:
...We'd certainly be a novelty act, if nothing else. (I'll think about it if I ever lose my attorney's badge.)
Speaker
Apollo:
A speaker for monitoring the stage. It was blaring at the time of the shooting.
Trucy:
It's a pretty old model for such a nice place.
Apollo:
I guess they don't care about sound quality back here. As long as you can hear it... (Not that a loss of fidelity could possibly make that music worse...)
Trucy:
Good speakers must cost a lot. You have any idea how much a nice one that size would cost, Apollo?
Apollo:
Probably a good ten years of your allowance, give or take.
Trucy:
Whaaat!? But that's almost 600 dollars!
Apollo:
...... (Five dollars a month...? Poor Trucy... Wait till she finds out you need to buy two speakers for a stereo...)
Television
Apollo:
That's one of the biggest, most expensive-looking TVs I've ever seen.
Trucy:
Too bad you'll never own one.
Apollo:
"Never"'s kind of harsh, Trucy.
Trucy:
Hmm. How about "for all eternity" then?
Apollo:
Same difference.
Carpet square
Apollo:
Hey, look. A part of the carpet has been torn up here.
Trucy:
That was the part we did the luminol testing on in court!
Apollo:
Luminol... right.
Trucy:
You know what I couldn't stop thinking? Who's going to pay for this carpet?
Apollo:
As long as it's not us... Maybe... the shooter?
Trucy:
I guess it's true what they say. Crime doesn't pay!
Apollo:
I would hope that carpet replacement costs weren't the only thing holding you back.
Flower bouquet
Trucy:
That's one heavy-duty bouquet there.
Apollo:
I have trouble thinking of flowers as being "heavy-duty".
Trucy:
But they call lots of things heavy-duty!
Apollo:
Not flowers, they don't.
Trucy:
What about a "heavy" scent?
Apollo:
I think you mean "heady".
Trucy:
What if the flowers were plastic?
Apollo:
They still wouldn't be heavy.
Trucy:
OK, what if they were made out of metal?
Apollo:
What, like a magnolia made out of steel?
Trucy:
Exactly! Though I hope all my fans don't start throwing metal flowers at me.
Hairdryer
Apollo:
That's one of those permanent dryers you see in hair salons.
Trucy:
Is that what they're really called? "Permanent dryers"?
Apollo:
Do I look like a beautician? I just know they dry your hair and give you a permanent...
Trucy:
It just doesn't sound very glamorous, you know?
Apollo:
OK, how about a "permachine"!?
Trucy:
Or you could go more simple, like "permer"!
Apollo:
...This isn't a bad game, thinking up official names for things. Not that it makes the name actually official or anything.
Presents
Trucy:
A stack of presents for Lamiroir. Stars always get the biggest presents. You know, you could give me a present, Apollo.
Apollo:
...Here, have a piece of candy.
Trucy:
Gee! Thanks!!!
Apollo:
(She must not get a lot of presents... Poor girl.)
Revolver
Apollo:
The murder weapon. So it belonged to Mr. LeTouse.
Trucy:
That thing makes normal revolvers look like water guns!
Apollo:
Mr. LeTouse was a big man. (But how about the person who shot him? Wouldn't they have to be about his size?)
Small window
Apollo:
This was the window where Lamiroir "saw" the crime from... I wish it was that simple.
Trucy:
Kind of hard to see a crime when you can't see. But she did hear it!
Apollo:
Yeah, but the window was closed...
Trucy:
Maybe she heard it some other way?
The stage
Examine
Computer
Apollo:
Look at all the electronics. They must be sound-related.
Trucy:
Doesn't seeing a bunch of machines like this make you want to just fiddle with 'em? Can I, Apollo? Please?
Apollo:
No, no fiddling! You'll break something.
Trucy:
If you're going to make an omelet, you gotta break some eggs! That's what Daddy always says.
Apollo:
These eggs look kind of expensive.
(Step)ladder
Apollo:
That's the ladder we used to climb up the stage tower. ...Not a moment I'm likely to forget any time soon.
Trucy:
Me neither... I'll never be able to climb another tower again without thinking about it, you know?
Apollo:
...I'll never be able to climb a tower again, period.
Stage
Trucy:
I still can't believe we found Machi and Mr. LeTouse up there...
Apollo:
Yeah. I used to not like high places. Now I hate them.
Trucy:
It's not like it would have been nicer if we found a dead body closer to the ground. ...Though that reminds me. Daddy's bad with heights, too.
Apollo:
Huh, no kidding.
Trucy:
He took me on a Ferris wheel ride a while ago, you know! Halfway through, his face got all green and he mumbled "objection" over and over.
Apollo:
(...Poor guy.)
After clearing all Talk options with Valant Gramarye and presenting Video Tape to Valant Gramarye:
July 9
In the Wings
Trucy:
That song... Isn't that the one Lamiroir was singing?
Apollo:
Yeah, you're right. "The Guitar's Serenade"...
Trucy:
Wow, I'd love to do a show on a stage like this!
Apollo:
I'd come to see that.
Trucy:
The house is full, and as one, the audience sighs with wonderment! There I am, singing my ballad, rose petals swirling through the air...
Apollo:
Not bad... wait. Aren't you a magician!?
Trucy:
...Oh. That's right. I was a magician, wasn't I.
Apollo:
(Some dedication...)
Valant:
Ah ha! If it isn't Miss Trucy! And indeed it is!
Trucy:
Uncle Valant!
Apollo:
What exactly are you doing here?
Valant:
...I take real responsibility in tasks undertaken. I am inspecting my equipment of illusion to make sure naught is amiss, Miss.
Trucy:
The Lamiroir Teleportation Illusion! Ooh!
Valant:
Should anything go wrong, it would reflect poorly upon me and my troupe. As I went about my exacting examination, I happened to notice that piano. ...And I remembered that fair lady's melancholy melody.
Trucy:
Hey Apollo, maybe Uncle Valant can shed some light on this whole thing for us!
Examine
Piano
Trucy:
That's one big piano! I've never actually played one.
Apollo:
Heh. You should get Mr. Wright to teach you sometime.
Trucy:
No good, he can't play either.
Apollo:
(I kind of feel bad for the guy now...)
Trucy:
Maybe now's my big chance! Stand back, this could be the debut of a prodigy! ...Eww.
Apollo:
Did you make that noise just now?
Trucy:
Um... Let me try it again. You know, I think something's stuck in the piano! Time to take a look under the hood... ...Huh. Look! This was stuck between the strings. It looks like some kind of switch.
Apollo:
(Someone must have thrown this into the piano...)
Switch placed in pocket.
Piano (subsequent times)
Apollo:
What do you think that thing was doing in there?
Trucy:
Throwing things inside pianos can't be good for them.
Apollo:
Not to mention you wouldn't be able to play whatever notes go with the strings it was on. (But the piano was fine during the concert... That must mean it was thrown in here after Machi played.)
Trucy:
So maybe someone threw it in here after the second set...
Talk
Lamiroir's illusion
Trucy:
I was wondering about the show the night of the murder. Lamiroir's vanishing act was your illusion, right?
Valant:
Indeed. The purple prosecutor petitioned my performance. At the climax of the song, he said, make her disappear. ...Like a dream.
Apollo:
Like a dream...
Valant:
Yet, what can I work with on a stage meant for musical endeavors? There are none of the conveniences of a stage built for sorcerous acts. It was a challenging task, and so I accepted.
Apollo:
She disappeared from the top of the tower... ...But in order to move, you would have had to use some sort of secret tunnel.
Valant:
People come to me because I am a professional among professionals. My illusions are custom-made for a time and a place. ...Now, because of the murder, all the eyes of the nation are on this concert. Not a bad thing, as far as the fortunes of Troupe Gramarye are concerned.
Trucy:
So... you were here checking up on your trick to make sure it went well.
Valant:
And went well it did. Now, speaking of pianos... ...That piano over there troubles me.
Apollo:
It troubles you...? Why?
Valant:
Why? Why do you ask, why?
Apollo:
(I think it's probably quicker if I just go check it out myself, thanks.)
Troupe Gramarye
Valant:
I know what you are thinking in that head of yours. "Gramarye, yes," you say. "I recall seeing him on television." Something of that sort?
Apollo:
Um, actually, yes, you're right.
Trucy:
Wow! He just read your mind, Apollo!
Apollo:
...Or everyone tells him that and he made a good guess.
Valant:
It was twenty years ago... A young magician, a genius of his time, came down among us... His name... was Magnifi Gramarye! It was he who began the great Troupe Gramarye! At his prime, not a day passed that he did not play upon the screens of every TV there was.
Apollo:
(I do have a vague memory of someone like that on TV...)
Valant:
Yet, several years ago, that time came to an end. My troupe pulled a vanishing act, yes. Cries for magic no longer heard, the TV screen a barren waste, stripped of illusion.
Trucy:
Th-That's not true! I still went to all your shows! Like that one in the parking lot down at the supermarket.
Apollo:
(When you start playing supermarket parking lots, you know you're in trouble.)
Valant:
...We hone our skill at these small venues, always awaiting our time. ...Yes, one day we will rise, up from obscurity, onto fame's shining stage once more! I do this not only for the magic that is Gramarye, but for my partner...
Apollo:
Your partner...? You mean...
Valant:
Yes. Zak Gramarye.
Apollo:
(Trucy's father...)
Valant:
Before he disappeared seven years ago... ...there was no name higher than Gramarye in show business circles. None. I will see us returned to glory! I, Valant Gramarye!
Valant and Zak (appears after "Troupe Gramarye")
Valant:
Our founder Magnifi Gramarye was truly a genius, a worker of miracles.
Trucy:
I'll never forget the one I saw when I was little! How he made that whole jumbo jet go... um, what happened to the jet again?
Apollo:
(...Apparently someone doesn't remember it as well as they thought.)
Valant:
Of all the would-be magicians who came to his door, only Zak and I had the talent. In no time at all, Valant and Zak were the shining stars in the Gramarye crown.
Trucy:
Cool, huh? And Zak Gramarye was my daddy!
Valant:
Now that Magnifi and Zak are gone, I have but one wish. Let it be I, Valant Gramarye who brings the Gramarye miracle back to the big stage!
Trucy:
I'm rooting for you!
Valant:
Miss Trucy, you cannot grow up quick enough! I need your skill by my side!
Trucy:
One skill, coming up!
Apollo:
(How do we manage to get off the topic of the case so quickly all the time?)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Valant:
Ah... The proof positive of your profession, yes?
Apollo:
Um, yeah.
Valant:
Might I... have a look? Oh! What's this? It is gone!
Apollo:
Ack! What'd you do with my attorney's badge!?
Valant:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha. Don't be alarmed. Miss Trucy! Take a look into your topit, if you would.
Trucy:
Eek! It's your badge, Apollo! What's it doing in there? That was amazing! Wasn't it, Apollo?
Apollo:
(He called that pouch at her waist a "topit"...? Is that some kind of magician speak?)
Revolver
Valant:
...Pardon me? I have no money, if that's what you want.
Apollo:
Ack! No, no, I was just... Um, never mind. (The way he looked at the revolver... What was that? It was almost as if he had seen one before... and maybe wasn't too happy about it.)
Valant:
......
Video Tape
Apollo:
I was wondering about the stunt in the video, right in the middle of the song.
Trucy:
I didn't see a stunt... Oh, that? I guess I'm so used to seeing that happen I didn't even notice.
Apollo:
(So young to be so jaded...)
Valant:
A simple slight-of-hand [sic], a petit prestidigitation. A modicum of magic from me... to you.
Trucy:
So that's why you were at the concert!
Valant:
Yes. I was there to watch my trick take to the air...
Apollo:
So! Can you tell me how you did it?
Trucy:
Whoa! You can't just ask that sort of thing, Apollo!
Apollo:
Trucy...?
Trucy:
It's against the rules to ask a magician how they did it.
Apollo:
Not when you're doing a murder investigation it's not!
Trucy:
...Well, you might have a point, there. Will you tell us, Uncle Valant?
Valant:
It is against all that is sacred to inquire as to how a trick is performed.
Apollo:
OK, so you tell me how he did it, Trucy.
Trucy:
But I don't know!
Apollo:
(C'mon, you're a magician! Aren't you part of the same secret club?)
Anything else
Valant:
Words cannot express my shock and chagrin... All I can see before me is this stage, and me, upon it. ...Nothing smaller, nothing less radiant catches my eye.
Trucy:
True. You're getting on in years. Not much time left to make your mark, huh...
Valant:
............ This is not how I was seeing it.
Apollo:
(So he doesn't care about what I have to show him, I get the point...)
Examine evidence
Switch
Button
Trucy:
This switch, sitting here, tempting me to push it...
Apollo:
Don't. You might blow up the whole coliseum.
Trucy:
Apollo, please... To think that every strange switch triggers a bomb... That kind of old-fashioned crime drama thinking doesn't cut it in our busy times!
Apollo:
Alright, Trucy P.I., please enlighten me. What do you think this switch does?
Trucy:
Hmm... Maybe it turns on the electric razor in Prosecutor Gavin's dressing room?
Apollo:
...A switch as big as razor to turn on a razor? OK...
Backstage Hallway
Talk
The voice
Apollo:
That was quite a statement you made today in court. ...About hearing Daryan Crescend's voice at the scene of the crime.
Lamiroir:
I did not know his name... ...but I never forget a voice.
Lamiroir:
Wait!
Judge:
La-Lamiroir! Is something the matter?
Lamiroir:
That voice just now... ............ It was him. I am sure of it.
Daryan:
...No way...
Lamiroir:
...As I said in court: I was on my way backstage from the stage. That is when I heard his voice.
Apollo:
I'm guessing Daryan and Mr. LeTouse were talking about something?
Lamiroir:
...The next moment, I heard those gunshots.
Apollo:
Why didn't you call security?
Lamiroir:
To be honest, though the noise was quite frightening... ...I never imagined the gunshots might be real. And, I was in quite a hurry myself. I left the scene at once.
Trucy:
So... it really was Daryan's voice that she heard.
Apollo:
Yeah... (At least, she certainly thinks it was.)
Machi
Lamiroir:
I met Machi before my debut as Lamiroir... I was singing in a restaurant in Borginia.
Apollo:
And he was playing the piano?
Lamiroir:
...Yes. He was very kind to me when he learned I could not see.
Apollo:
Is that when you started playing "opposites"? With Machi pretending he couldn't see...
Lamiroir:
Ah, no, it wasn't then. That began after our major debut. ...After I became known as the "landscape painter in sound".
Trucy:
It must have been tough for Machi... ...Pretending he couldn't see, and all the while acting as your eyes.
Lamiroir:
We held hands always. He would write with his finger on my palm to signal to me thing I should know. He is a smart, gentle boy.
Apollo:
(I think I see what she's getting at... ..."Machi would never harm a soul"...)
Mr. LeTouse
Apollo:
About Mr. LeTouse...
Lamiroir:
Ah yes. He was an Interpol agent, I hear?
Apollo:
So, you had no idea?
Lamiroir:
Of course not. No one did.
Trucy:
I guess that's what it means to be undercover.
Apollo:
But someone was after him... They had to know who he really was.
Lamiroir:
Why did he pose as my manager? I do not understand.
Apollo:
You have no idea?
Lamiroir:
I can only assume that he was investigating me... But why?
Apollo:
What makes you think that?
Lamiroir:
Perhaps it is not so, but I cannot deny the possibility. Because of my condition... As my present is veiled in darkness, so, too, is my past clouded from my memory.
Apollo:
Clouded... right.
"Darkness" (appears after "Mr. LeTouse")
Lamiroir:
The darkness that I fear is not the darkness that I see whenever I open my eyes. The real darkness... lies in my heart.
Apollo:
In your heart?
Lamiroir:
I have no memory of the time before I became Lamiroir. I awoke from darkness, into darkness, you might say. I was singing in a restaurant those days.
Apollo:
(What was it that she said about not being able to remember the light...?)
Lamiroir:
I do not know my past. Perhaps I committed some terrible crime in my past. Everything before becoming Lamiroir is lost to me.
Trucy:
B-But I don't think you...
Lamiroir:
I can think of no other explanation. Why else would an agent of Interpol approach me?
Apollo:
Do you think your past might be related to this case?
Trucy:
No way! That seems really unlikely to me. I mean, you're such a sweet person, Lamiroir!
Lamiroir:
...I thank you. Machi, too, tells me this often when I fear who I might have been.
Present
Video Tape
Apollo:
We took a look at your performance again. It was even better the second time!
Lamiroir:
Thank you.
Trucy:
That reminds me... That was an incredible illusion you pulled off!
Lamiroir:
Illusion...?
Trucy:
When you teleported from one stage to the other? Remember?
Lamiroir:
Ah, yes. Apparently, they hired a professional magician.
Apollo:
(Valant Gramarye...) I was wondering, do you think you could tell us how it was done?
Lamiroir:
...I'm afraid I cannot. Mr. Gramarye made me swear to never tell a soul.
Apollo:
I was afraid of that...
Trucy:
Hard to be a magician if you can't keep a secret, you know?
Anything else
Apollo:
Do you think you could tell me about this?
Lamiroir:
I'm sorry, but my information about the outside world is somewhat limited. I only know what I have heard, or felt.
Apollo:
(Maybe that explains why she didn't react when I showed her stuff the other day. She was still pretending she could see then...)
After clearing all Talk options and presenting Video Tape:
Apollo:
Can I ask you about this headset, Lamiroir? You said that all concert staff were wearing one?
Lamiroir:
That's correct. You need them to communicate across such a large stage. Everyone on the staff had one, of course... ...And all of the band members, too, I should think.
Apollo:
(So Prosecutor Gavin and his lackeys had them on, too, then...)
Lamiroir:
They're quite helpful, though limited. They only work within thirty feet or so. After all, they're only for use on stage. And a stronger signal would interfere with the sound system.
Apollo:
Hmm, that makes sense. (You'd think someone would notice if they dropped their only communications lifeline. ...So why was this one lying here?)
Lamiroir:
Ah, I am reminded that I wished to speak to you about something.
Apollo:
Yes?
Lamiroir:
When I was walking this hallway before... I stumbled upon a small device of some kind. It was lying on the floor.
Apollo:
Device...? Maybe you mean this?
Trucy:
That's been lying there since the day before yesterday!
Lamiroir:
Might I... touch it? ...... I thought as much.
Apollo:
What? What did you think?
Lamiroir:
This is one of our headsets. Everyone on staff wears one during a concert.
Apollo:
I wonder whose this is?
Lamiroir:
We use it for communication. It would be quite inconvenient should it go missing.
Apollo:
We'll hold on to it for you then. We'll give it to Prosecutor Gavin when we see him.
Lamiroir:
Yes, that's best. Thank you.
Trucy:
So, can I put it on?
Headset attached to Trucy.
Trucy:
"Attached"? I'm not some kind of robot, Apollo!
Apollo:
(Everyone on staff was wearing one of these headsets... This might warrant some further inquiry.)
Present
Headset
Apollo:
Can I ask you about this headset, Lamiroir? You said that all concert staff were wearing one?

That's correct. You need them to communicate across such a large stage. Everyone on the staff had one, of course... ...And all of the band members, too, I should think.

Headset
Receiver
Trucy:
10-4 that, little buddy, this is Trucy reporting in, over. ......
Apollo:
Why the sudden silence?
Trucy:
No one answered.
Apollo:
Don't be silly.
Trucy:
What good is a receiver that doesn't receive? That's like Ema not performing forensic investigations!
Apollo:
You make her sound like she's some kind of forensic investigation machine! Which is just silly. Unless... she's a super hi-tech android that runs on Snackoos! Hmm...
After presenting Headset in Backstage Hallway:
July 9Lamiroir's Dressing Room
...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH...
Apollo:
Uh oh... There's only one person I know who can munch with such... venom.
Ema:
...What are you doing here?
Apollo:
Hello, Ema. You're looking as grumpy as ever.
Ema:
Oh, am I supposed to be happy? You give me the second degree in court, and Prosecutor Gavin makes me look like a fool.
Apollo:
...You're talking about the blood stain Mr. LeTouse left?
Ema:
My department chief had a field day with that one. "Even a blind person could see the shooter wasn't blind!" Funny guy, huh?
Trucy:
But that blood stain helped uncover the biggest mystery of all!
Apollo:
Now we know that Mr. LeTouse was really with Interpol.
Trucy:
We wouldn't have found that out without you!
Ema:
I suppose. Maybe that's why the chief gave me these after he was finished chewing me out. Said it was my reward.
Apollo:
...Are chocolate Snackoos popular down at the precinct or something?
Ema:
...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH...
Trucy:
...I was hoping we could check out the crime scene again.
Ema:
Be my guest. You're not going to find any clues in here. ...Though I did find something strange.
Trucy:
Something strange?
Examine
Air vent
Apollo:
That's the air vent with Machi Tobaye's fingerprints.
Trucy:
......
Apollo:
What's with the frown?
Ema:
Can't a girl frown anymore? Is that a crime?
Apollo:
Ack! No, of course not, I just meant...
Ema:
Machi Tobaye's fingerprints are on that air vent. Why would his fingerprints be there if he wasn't the shooter?
Apollo:
(That's not a question I want to have to answer in court.)
Ema:
Hey! Wipe that frown off your face. One stick in the mud per crime scene, please.
Apollo:
(I guess girls can frown, but defense attorneys can't.)
Carpet square
Apollo:
Look, the carpet's been torn up here.
Trucy:
That's the part we did the lunimol testing on in court!
Ema:
"Loony mall"? What's "Loony mall"!? It's "Luminol"! Get it right!
Trucy:
...! Ema's kind of scary when it comes to science.
Apollo:
...Best learn the word and not incite her wrath again.
Talk
The trial today
Ema:
I met my embarrassment quota for the year, that's for sure.
Trucy:
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?
Ema:
Um, how?
Trucy:
I mean, think about it. Now you don't have to be embarrassed about anything else all year!
Apollo:
...If only it worked that way.
Ema:
It just bugs me to think that little kid outsmarted me. And it makes him even more suspicious now that we know he can see! He could have seen the air duct, and he could have shot that revolver.
Trucy:
But that's not how it sounded in Lamiroir's testimony.
Ema:
You mean her saying she heard Detective Daryan's voice at the scene? Hmm...
Trucy:
That's right!
Ema:
Why can't we have a normal, straightforward killing once in a while in this country!?
Apollo:
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
The case
Ema:
Was that true what you said in court today? You know, about the case... About how everything was happening according to those song lyrics?
Apollo:
..."The Guitar's Serenade", you mean?
Trucy:
I found the link, you know! First, Prosecutor Gavin's heart-shaped key ring was stolen. Then Lamiroir flew through the air. Then Prosecutor Gavin's guitar caught on fire. And in the end, a bullet took Mr. LeTouse's life... And he went up into the sky with a guitar... Well, thirty feet up, at least.
Ema:
It is kind of hard to chalk it up to coincidence, hmm.
Trucy:
I know! And I found it.
Ema:
You think the same person did all of this?
Apollo:
Don't ask me. I didn't do it.
Ema:
Neither did I! I couldn't fit through that air vent anyway.
Trucy:
What... You all think I did it!?
Apollo:
(Sometimes I worry about that girl.)
Something strange
Trucy:
...So what did you find?
Ema:
It's so little I must have passed over it yesterday. I found it under the sofa.
Trucy:
...What is it?
Ema:
Part of some device, I think. I haven't a clue what. The bit sticking out from the end looked familiar, so I had it examined. Turns out it's an antenna.
Trucy:
Ooh, like on a beetle?
Ema:
Like on a cell phone. This device must use an electronic signal of some sort.
Trucy:
An electronic signal, you say? Hmm...
The switch (appears after clearing "Something strange" Talk option and presenting Switch)
Ema:
...What are you trying to do, burn me alive!?
Apollo:
C'mon, it was just a few sparks.
Ema:
Says you! You weren't the one holding it!
Trucy:
There's enough sparks flying around here just with you two talking.
Apollo:
Anyway... Now we know this is a remote for an igniter.
Ema:
Let me see that for a second. ......
Apollo:
Well?
Ema:
Well, this is definitely a little transmitter. The signal's weak, probably only reaches thirty feet.
Trucy:
A transmitter, huh...
Remote Trigger updated in the Court Record.
Ema:
Incidentally, if you look at a cross-section diagram of the stage area... ...Let's see, thirty feet from Lamiroir's dressing room... That covers the backstage completely. It also looks like it would cover the stage.
Apollo:
(It kind of seems unlikely anyone would use this on stage...)
Forum Diagram added to the Court Record.

Attorney's Badge
Ema:
You know, you're a bit like Mr. Wright. He always carried his badge around, too.
Apollo:
Huh?
Ema:
I think he did it so he'd never forget who he was, or his duty as a defender. Something like that. Pretty noble, really.
Apollo:
(I guess there really isn't a need for me to carry this around. Though it seems to have made a decent impression...)
Lyrics Sheet
Ema:
Why did they have to commit their crime according to the song? Seems like it'd be more trouble than it's worth.
Trucy:
Maybe they were trying to throw off the investigation?
Ema:
That's certainly possible. But risky, don't you think? Just carrying someone as big as Mr. LeTouse would be tough enough.
Apollo:
(She may be a snacking fiend, but sometimes, she actually makes some sense.)
Revolver
Ema:
That's an Interpol-issue revolver, right?
Apollo:
Which means it belonged to Mr. LeTouse. He must have had it to begin with.
Ema:
Sounds that way.
Apollo:
So, if it was Machi... Are we saying Machi stole it from Mr. LeTouse...?
Ema:
......
Apollo:
(Now that's really hard to imagine him doing...)
Switch
Apollo:
Do you think you could take a look at this?
Ema:
Hmm. A small device... Looks like a transmitter.
Trucy:
A transmitter?
Ema:
You press this switch here and it sends out a signal. No idea what it's for, though.

I-I-It's on fire! Ema's device is on fire!
Ema:
What's the big idea!?
Apollo:
...Ack!
Ema:
Well, now we know what this is: an igniter.
Trucy:
This part here must work like a lighter!
Ema:
It nearly lit me up, that's for sure!
Apollo:
Hey, don't look at me like that. I didn't do it on purpose!
Ema:
I suppose. At least, we're getting somewhere with this case.
Trucy:
Hey, Apollo! Let's ask Ema more about this switch!
Trucy:
Now that she has some first-hand experience.
Switch (subsequent times)
Ema:
What! You aren't trying to burn me up again, are you? Who sent you to get me? Who?
Apollo:
I'm not out to get you, promise.
Ema:
Promise!? No promise is good enough with you still carrying that weapon around! Try burning me again with that trigger of yours... ...and I'll throw 100 bags worth of Snackoos at you!

Good luck!

Too bad, I was hoping it was for a bomb that would blow up the whole coliseum. 
Apollo:
You're scaring me. If Ema hears you talking like that she'll arrest you.
Trucy:
And then she'll do all sorts of scientific tests! Like splitting your hairdo into three separate spikes. While she stands by, laughing and laughing in her high-pitched voice. 
Apollo:
... I said she'd arrest you, not me. And she's not some kind of mad scientist.
Trucy:

Apollo:
All these little parts... It's pretty complex. I'm guessing this is where the fire comes out. Other than that...

Good thing machines run even if we don't know how many work! ...That's what Daddy always says.
Apollo:
Not really a saying you want to go around repeating, Trucy.

Daryan:
What? Come to laugh at the murderer?
Trucy:
Daryan...
Daryan:
That old bag opens her pie hole, and wham-bam my life goes down the chute. Thanks! They won't let me work while I'm a suspect!
Trucy:
Daryan isn't in the best of moods, is he?
Apollo:
Not many people are these days, it seems.
Trucy:
It is a crime scene. Not exactly the happiest place to hang out.
Daryan:
Then Gavin had to go rub salt in the wound... My alibi's rock solid. Rock solid!
Talk
Your alibi
Trucy:
So, about your alibi...
Daryan:
You have to ask? The shooting happened right in the middle of the third set!
Apollo:
Um... that's right. (The music was blaring when we heard those gunshots... ...And found Mr. LeTouse dead.)
Daryan:
I've got ten thousand witnesses who saw me, too. Right there on that stage.
Trucy:
Your guitar playing was something else!
Daryan:
Thanks, little lady. ...See? This whole thing's a sham. I can't believe they aren't letting me work!
Apollo:
There's no need to yell at me... (It's Lamiroir's fault... She was the one who said she heard his voice at the moment of the crime...)
Daryan:
Man, I never even talked to that old windbag! How could she possibly identify me?
Prosecutor Gavin
Trucy:
They won't let you work?
Daryan:
He won't let me work! Gavin! Says I gotta lie low till the suspicion is cleared. What suspicion!? He can be such a stick in the mud.
Trucy:
Mr. Gavin? A stick in the mud?
Daryan:
He may look all flashy and showy, but he's straight as an arrow, man. ...'Cept when he's depressed. You hear him whining the other day?
Apollo:
Oh, you mean the thing with the mixing board?
Klavier:
...And then there was that performance just now. What was that all about!?
Apollo:
This part is off.
Klavier:
Which is that? Hmm... 2nd Guitar.
Daryan:
Ah.
Klavier:
It was you Daryan!
Daryan:
He's just a perfectionist, is all. Not a bad guy, really.
Trucy:
Well, I think the Gavinners are the best! I have all your albums.
Daryan:
The band's fine, too. Gavin can write a good tune, I'll give him that.

Lyrics Sheet
Daryan:
"The Guitar's Serenade", eh? Classic tearjerker, that one.
Trucy:
You don't think he based it on a real experience, do you?
Daryan:
Probably not. He writes by feeling, more than memory.
Trucy:
Ooh! You mean the songs just kind of "come to him"?
Daryan:
Yeah, something like that. I guess you could call him a genius. Of course he changes the song and lyrics on a whim. Drives me up the wall.
Apollo:
He makes his court cases on a whim sometimes, too.
Daryan:
He changed the lyrics to a song just before a recording the other day, even. Wants to put in this line about a university student obsessed with girls. Whatever!
Apollo:
(Hmm? Why does that sound strangely familiar?)
Daryan:
Of course it always turns out good in the end. That's his talent, I suppose.
Anything else
Daryan:
Look, if you want to talk about the case, talk to someone else, 'kay? Don't want Gavin having another one of his hissy fits.
After clearing all Talk options:
Apollo:
Come to think of it, I haven't seen Prosecutor Gavin around much.
Daryan:
Oh, him? He's down at the prosecutor's office, most likely.
Apollo:
The prosecutor's office... (I've never been there, have I.)
Daryan:
The data on the victim should have come in from Interpol. ...Normally, I'd be down there dealing with it. Normally.
Trucy:
Apollo! Let's go check it out! I've always wanted to see the prosecutor's office.
Apollo:
Hmm... Maybe that's not such a bad idea.
Trucy:
Right on!
Daryan:
Say "hi" for me, OK? Oh, and "screw you". And tell him I want into that crime scene!
Apollo:

Daryan:
Hey, wait.
Apollo:
Y...Yes?
Daryan:
What do you really think happened? Really? You don't think I did it, right?
Apollo:
W-Well...
Daryan:
Great. Way to instill a guy with some confidence. Just remember, I was ripping it up on stage when it happened, OK? Ripping!
Apollo:
...!
Daryan:
Don't get led astray by some siren song, eh? Get this one wrong, and you'll be eating humble pie for a year. I'll bake it myself.

July 9
Prosecutor Gavin's Office
Trucy:
So... this is it. The Gavinners's head office.
Apollo:
It's not the band's office. It's the prosecutor's office.
Klavier:
Yeah, so that's why I am asking, what is this creepy thing... object... whatever.
Apollo:
...Looks like Prosecutor Gavin is on the phone.
Trucy:
Oh well, guess we'll have to come back. Or we can hide behind that bookshelf real quiet-like...
Apollo:
...That's eavesdropping.
Trucy:
Why? We'd just be waiting. Quietly. So he didn't notice. What if we heard something scandalous about the band!?
Apollo:
(She'd make a good reporter... for a gossip mag.)
Klavier:
What? A "replica"...? So why was he after it in the first place? Yeah, LeTouse!
Apollo:
(LeTouse...?)
Klavier:
Look, don't talk to me about those Borginians, OK? Just get me that report, chop chop. ...And stop leaving mysterious objects in my office, OK?
...*beep*...
Klavier:
It's times like this when I start to miss Daryan... ...Huh?
Apollo:
Erm, hiya!
Trucy:
Tee hee! Just thought we'd drop in. Hope you're not mad...?
Klavier:
...How could I be? There's not enough "tee hee" in the world, in any case. Have a seat.
Apollo:
(Prosecutor Gavin, the philanthropist.)
Trucy:
Watch and learn, Apollo!
Klavier:
So, who have you come to see?
Trucy:
Huh?
Klavier:
Klavier, lead vocalist for the Gavinners? Or Prosecutor Gavin, scourge of the courtroom?
Trucy:
What do you think he means, Apollo?
Apollo:
I think he's giving us a choice. We can either ask him about the concert... or the case. (Which way to go?)
Examine
Burnt guitar
Apollo:
That was an impressive bit of pyrotechnics that did this.
Trucy:
That's the guitar from the concert, isn't it...
Klavier:
I thought it was one of the staff playing a gag on me. I never guessed that wasn't the end of it... I had a specialist analyze the guitar, incidentally.
Trucy:
Oh? Did you find anything out?
Klavier:
He didn't have a lot of time, so it's still unclear... But the results he came up with were... intriguing.
Apollo:
Intriguing? (How does that guitar tie into everything that went on?)
Trucy:
Sounds like something we should ask about.
Glass jar
Trucy:
What's that on the plate there?
Apollo:
Is that... gum?
Trucy:
Gum...?
Apollo:
Maybe he was chewing it when the phone rang. So he put it on the plate for later consumption.
Trucy:
You'd think a rock star could afford a fresh stick.
Klavier:
Don't jump to any conclusions, now. That's no chewing gum. Take a closer look... ...Although I really shouldn't be offering, should I.
Apollo:
(What is that...? It looks like a lump of plastic...?)
Trucy:
Wait, that phone call...
Klavier:
Yeah, so that's why I am asking, what is this creepy thing... object... whatever.
Apollo:
...Looks like Prosecutor Gavin is on the phone.
Klavier:
What? A "replica"...? So why was he after it in the first place? Yeah, LeTouse!
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin, does this have something to do with Mr. LeTouse?
Klavier:
...Wait a second! You were listening to my phone call, weren't you!?
Trucy:
Who? Us? I-I tried to stop him, really! But he forced me to!
Apollo:
Hey, you were the one digging for a scandal, Ms. Reporter!
Klavier:
...Too [sic] tell the truth, I'm not even sure what it is. But apparently, it's a model of something undercover agent Mr. LeTouse was after.
Trucy:
This... lump?
Apollo:
Would you mind telling us what you do know about it?
Guitar display wall
Apollo:
Look at all the guitars! Why so many?
Klavier:
You can never have too many guitars. They are like... my lovers.
Apollo:
(I didn't just hear him say that.)
Trucy:
They're backup guitars, Apollo. Don't you know anything? Rock 'n' rollers always smash their guitars at the end of a show!
Apollo:
No wonder it's so hard to make it as a musician.
Trucy:
You know what, you should try rocking a little, Apollo.
Apollo:
And breaking his guitars while he watches? That might be a little too rocking.
Klavier:
Ah ha ha ha. Of course, I would never do such a thing. Did I not say, they are like my lovers? Do I seem like the kind of man who would do such a thing to ones he loves?
Trucy:
No, no! Not at all! I mean, you're Mr. Gavin, upstanding prosecutor!
Apollo:
(What happened to Prosecutor Gavin, god of rock?)
Klavier's desk
Trucy:
Wow, look at that stereo!
Klavier:
To me, a life without music is inconceivable. I never turn down the volume, even when I'm working on a case.
Trucy:
That's such a huge speaker! It must be really loud!
Klavier:
This room is completely soundproof, of course.
Trucy:
Really? At my place I can hear when the neighbors turn their VCR on to record something.
Apollo:
Maybe you can get Mr. Wright to talk to them, work something out?
Trucy:
And lately, we've been getting complaints about Apollo's voice training.
Apollo:
...Maybe I'll go have a word with Mr. Wright, too.
Monitors
Apollo:
This display shows all the evidence for the case.
Trucy:
Look, Apollo! He's got three televisions!
Klavier:
Hey, don't look at those too closely. I'm still sorting out the details.
Apollo:
(Each monitor shows evidence for a different case. He does them all at once!?)
Trucy:
I wish I had three TVs.
Apollo:
What would you possibly do with three television sets?
Trucy:
I may look laid back and relaxed, but in reality, I'm quite busy, you know! I'm living life at turbo speed! Doing magic, going to school, investigating cases... But... But if I had three big TVs...! I could watch a magic video, do my homework, and catch a crime drama all at once!
Apollo:
The first two seem useful, I suppose.
Reclining chair
Apollo:
......
Trucy:
What's wrong, Apollo? You look confused.
Apollo:
I was just wondering where the "work chair" in this office was.
Klavier:
You're looking at my favorite chair right now.
Apollo:
...That's a massage chair, isn't it?
Klavier:
That is an ergonomic, adjustable office--
Trucy:
I love the ones with the vibrating rollers on your back! Those feel great!
Klavier:
......
Trucy:
Did I say something wrong?
Klavier:
No. I merely realized the futility of an explanation.
Window
Klavier:
The view is exhilarating, ja? I sit here, gazing down upon the city, writing my songs.
Apollo:
Try working on cases.
Klavier:
It is the same thing. I write lyrics the same way I corroborate evidence. It is a harmony between the logical mind, and the primal spirit within!
Apollo:
(Is it so hard to admit that you like staring out your window and daydreaming?)
Talk
The case
Klavier:
Ah, that reminds me, did you see the paper today?
Trucy:
Yes! I always read the TV section.
Klavier:
Good girl. How about you, Herr Forehead?
Apollo:
...I read the funnies.
Klavier:
...Then you will not have seen this!
Apollo:
"Concert of Tragedy -- The Prosecutor's Deadly Song!"
Trucy:
Ooh, is that a new show? I haven't heard about that one.
Klavier:
It's not a show. It's an article. News, you know?
Trucy:
Oh, does this have anything to do with the case...?
Klavier:
Since getting back from the trial, my phone has been ringing off the hook! "How does it feel to take a man's life with a song?" "Have you ever hummed a man all the way to death row?" "Do you think you could sing for me over the phone?" ...It is endless. Endless! Thanks to the case you made today, of course.
Trucy:
Oh, that was all Apollo's idea!
Apollo:
(Hey!) Hmm? Is that a newspaper over there, too?
Klavier:
Ah yes. The Borginian Daily Bugle. Go ahead, take a look.
Apollo:
Um, thanks, but I can't read Borginian.
Klavier:
Oh, that's right. Suffice it to say this is big news over there as well. Though they didn't go so far as to mention the lyrics to my song.
Trucy:
Probably no one in Borginia could believe it.
Klavier:
...It's probably seen as "just a theory" at this point. Their journalists didn't see the need to mention it.
Apollo:
That makes sense. I hardly know what to think of it myself.
Borginian Newspaper added to the Court Record.
Klavier:
Lamiroir's testimony will probably be in the evening edition, I'd imagine. Which is why I've had Daryan step down from the investigation for now.
Trucy:
Yeah, we ran into him moping in front of the coliseum.
Klavier:
Lamiroir was my invited guest, so it is a rather delicate situation... ...You understand how much I want to solve this case. Quickly, if possible.
The Guitar's Serenade
Trucy:
I really love that song. It has such a great atmosphere to it.
Apollo:
You co-wrote it with Lamiroir, if I remember correctly?
Klavier:
That's right. It was last year... I had gone to tour Borginia's legal system, as a matter of fact.
Trucy:
And that's when you heard Lamiroir's voice?
Klavier:
It was at a small jazz club. ...I wept that night. I knew I had to meet her, to talk with her. So I used my influence, which is not inconsiderable, to arrange a meeting.
Trucy:
Wow, prosecutors really have a lot of clout.
Apollo:
I think he's sort of a special case, Trucy.
Klavier:
Thankfully, she liked the work I did, and we wrote a song right there, backstage. Machi on piano, that dulcet voice... And myself on a guitar that I borrowed from Lamiroir.
Trucy:
And music history was made! Probably not an experience your average lawyer would ever have. Like Apollo, say.
Klavier:
It is a memory I hold dear. And the song we wrote that night... was this. And that very guitar is right over there.
Apollo:
You mean... this charred lump?
Trucy:
Don't call it a lump! That's a piece of history! And it's only browned, not really "charred".
Klavier:
No matter. I shall never sing that song again. I wouldn't have used that guitar again either, even if I could have.
Apollo:
(What happened during that song, anyway? Why did his guitar suddenly catch on fire?)
Trucy:
Do you think you could show it to us? Your charred... I mean slightly burnt guitar?
Apollo:
I'm sure he doesn't mind. What more could happen to it?
Lamiroir's guitar (appears after clearing "The Guitar's Serenade" Talk option and examining burnt guitar)
Klavier:
...It was a beautiful instrument. It was played lovingly for many years. A guitar befitting a woman like Lamiroir.
Trucy:
How did it end up here?
Klavier:
She gave it to me. I mentioned how much I enjoyed playing it that night, and she made a present of it.
Trucy:
So this guitar is from Borginia?
Klavier:
That it is. We couldn't carry it on the plane. Changes in air pressure and humidity ruin the wood. So, we vacuum packed it in Lamiroir's studio. I used a special shipping service available to me for transporting evidence. They brought it right up to my office for me. ...Pristine and untouched.
Trucy:
See, prosecutors do have a lot of clout.
Apollo:
Um, I still think he's a special case.
Trucy:
Such a valuable guitar... It's too bad it got burned.
Prosecutor Gavin's Guitar added to the Court Record.
Apollo:
What was it that you were saying earlier? ...Something about intriguing results from an examination of the guitar?
Trucy:
That's right! What was that all about?
Klavier:
Well, you know how guitars have a round hole in the front? It is called the "sound hole".
Apollo:
Ah, so that's what it's called.
Klavier:
Well, they found something attached to the wood just inside the hole. ...A broken device of some sort.
Trucy:
A broken... device?
Klavier:
Yes. This, in fact. The examiner is busy with evidence for the case now, however. So he'll be checking this out once he's finished with everything else.
Trucy:
Hmm...
Apollo:
(Odd. That device looks strangely familiar...)
The strange lump (appears after examining glass jar)
Klavier:
This was found in Mr. LeTouse's bag. It's apparently a replica of something.
Apollo:
A replica... (It's a small lump, about an inch and a half long.)
Klavier:
We analyzed it... but there's not much to say, other than it's a lump of plastic. Perhaps it was to be used in the identification of whatever it is a replica of.
Apollo:
You mean... whatever Mr. LeTouse was after?
Klavier:
That seems to be the most logical explanation.
Trucy:
Well? Well? What is it?
Klavier:
Don't ask me, Fräulein.
Trucy:
Oh? If you don't want to tell us, you could just say so.
Klavier:
I've put in a request to Interpol via my contacts in Borginia... But, apparently there is a block on information somewhere along the chain.
Trucy:
Oh?
Klavier:
Something Interpol doesn't want to tell Borginia... Something about this little piece of plastic.
Apollo:
(Mr. LeTouse went through all that trouble to become Lamiroir's manager... ...just to come to this country to find out more about... this lump? And he died for it.)
Replica added to the Court Record.
Klavier:
I've sent someone to the coliseum to fetch Lamiroir. Perhaps she knows something about it, being a Borginian.

Klavier:
I was singing it for you, Fräulein.

Why, you gave me so much information! That igniter, for instance...
Apollo:
Oh. That.
Klavier:
I've never met an attorney so forthcoming with the prosecution. It's a big help. ...Or perhaps you're just a tad naïve, hmm?
Apollo:
(...I guess I could have hid it, but somehow, showing it felt like the right thing.) I could say the same... to you, Prosecutor Gavin.
Klavier:
...?
Apollo:
Thanks for the information. About the, er, strange lump of plastic. The one that Mr. LeTouse was investigating.
Trucy:
Hey, that's right...
Klavier:
I've been thinking, Herr Forehead. We encounter many incidents in our lives, all of us. Not all of them simple.
Apollo:
...Especially not the ones where people are killing to song lyrics.
Klavier:
That is why I try to at least remain simple inside. And I keep a simple goal: to discover the truth.
Apollo:
......
Klavier:
That's why I like to keep relations civil, ja? ...That is all.
Apollo:
...I can live with that.
Trucy:
Um... Mr. Prosecutor?
Klavier:
Fräulein?
Trucy:
Can I ask you why you sing in a band?
Klavier:
Ah. Because I want women to turn and look when I walk down the street.
Apollo:
That's pretty simple, too.
Klavier:
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do. Another time, perhaps.
Examine
Burnt guitar
Apollo:
The charred remains of what was once a fine guitar.
Trucy:
Mr. Gavin got it as a present from Lamiroir!
Apollo:
And he had it shipped back from Borginia in a vacuum-sealed case.
Trucy:
Kinda sad how it ended up.
Apollo:
(...Not to mention there was an igniter placed just inside the sound hole. I wish I knew why...)
Glass jar
Trucy:
......
Apollo:
Why the sudden silence, Trucy?
Trucy:
Oh, I'm sorry. It's nothing, really. I was just wondering, wouldn't it be cool if that replica just happened to vanish?
Apollo:
(Ah, the young magician at work again.)
Trucy:
Though a simple disappearance would kind of lack punch. What if it hatched into a dove? Or a person, dressed like a dove...
Apollo:
(There she goes...)
Guitar display wall
Apollo:
These guitars are vintage models. Probably pretty expensive, too.
Trucy:
They've even got little locks on them!
Apollo:
Weren't you good at picking locks?
Trucy:
Apollo! You don't want me to...? ...Well, I do kinda like that cherry red one!
Apollo:
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Trucy:
Oh. That's too bad.
Apollo:
(Sorry, my little thief in the making. Maybe next time.)
Klavier's desk
Apollo:
That's an insanely big speaker for a room this small. Oh, look... All the CDs are Gavinners CDs.
Monitors
Trucy:
He left his TV on. Think we should turn it off for him?
Apollo:
Nah, wouldn't want to make him angry.
Trucy:
OK, if you say so. It's kind of a waste of electricity.
Apollo:
You just want to play with his TV. I know you.
Trucy:
Tee hee! How'd you know? It's just, I've never seen a TV this big before!
Apollo:
I hate to break it to you, but it's actually a monitor. It doesn't play TV shows.
Trucy:
What!? You mean no soap operas!? No Saturday morning cartoons!?
Apollo:
...Nope. Sorry.
Trucy:
I... I had no idea.
Apollo:
(There, there, you'll get over it.)
Reclining chair
Trucy:
What a cool chair! I'm going to sit in it now while no one's looking! Wow! So this is what it feels like to be a star!
Apollo:
(Who would have thought a chair could bring so much joy into someone's life.)
Trucy:
I can imagine sitting here, strumming my guitar... "Oh, it's you, Herr Forehead. Sorry... I'm busy. Woooo."
Apollo:
You know, that was a remarkably good imitation.
Trucy:
Tee hee! Maybe I'll make that part of my Wonder Bar repertoire!
Window
Apollo:
What floor are we on again? The view is incredible!
Trucy:
Wow! The people look like little rice grains! Hey! That one with the blonde hair! Do you think that's Mr. Gavin?
Apollo:
Uh... He's a little too small to see.
Trucy:
But look at the one next to him with the big black poof of hair pointing straight ahead!
Apollo:
Oh yeah, that's Daryan alright.
After examining glass jar in Prosecutor Gavin's Office:
July 9Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Trucy:
Looks like Machi is in questioning.
Apollo:
Huh, the police must have a Borginian interpreter. That's no fair. I wish we could talk to him.
Trucy:
I guess we'll just have to come back later if we want to see him.
Apollo:
I guess so.
Examine
Security camera
Apollo:
That security camera is looking at me. Does that thing just sit there recording 24 hours a day? It must use one of those ultra-long-play tapes.
Security guard
Apollo:
A security guard. He stands here, watching this room. I think the guard is trying to set a record for the longest time without blinking.
July 9
Sunshine Coliseum
Ema:
...Oh, it's you. You came at a good time.
Apollo:
Hello there, Ema. What's up?
Ema:
Either of you know where Lamiroir is?
Apollo:
Um... well, I saw her in the backstage hallway a while ago.
Ema:
Yeah? That's strange...
Trucy:
What's strange?
Ema:
I can't find her anywhere. I was supposed to bring her to the prosecutor's office...
Apollo:
(Lamiroir's missing!?)
Ema:
It's hard to imagine her wandering off somewhere on her own. ...Being that she's blind and all.
Apollo:
Yeah. We'll help you look for her.
Ema:
Great! Thanks.
July 9, 4:46 PM
In the Wings
Trucy:
Huh? The stage is pitch dark!
Apollo:
The power breaker must be off for this section... Great.
Trucy:
I'll go get someone! Yipes, it was really dark out there.
Apollo:
Dark... That's all Lamiroir has, when you think about it. (What would it be like to live in a world of darkness?)
Trucy:
...Hey, Apollo.
Apollo:
Huh? What?
Trucy:
...Doesn't something about the stage seem different to you? Like, something's changed?
Apollo:
Changed?
Trucy:
I can't put my finger on it, but it's bugging me.
Apollo:
(Now it's bugging me, too! What's she talking about?)
Examine
Guitar case
Leads to:
"Hey, that case... Wasn't that open before?"
Trucy:
Hey, that case... Wasn't that open before?
Apollo:
Huh. I guess someone closed it.
Trucy:
Wait... Look! Where the case closes...
Apollo:
Something's sticking out! That... doesn't look like an instrument. You don't think it's...
Trucy:
Let's open it, Apollo! Eeeeeeeek! Lamiroir! Lamiroooooooir!
Apollo:
Ema! We have to get Ema!
Apollo:
(Lamiroir was taken directly to the hospital. Ema ran around, barking orders, making phone calls. Trucy just clung to my arm and cried... And me, I was still in shock. Two bodies in two days is two too many.)
July 9, 5:53 PM
Hickfield Clinic
Waiting Room
Trucy:
Ema! How's Lamiroir? Is she OK?
Ema:
Ah, you. We all owe you a big "thanks", that's for sure.
Trucy:
So... she's OK?
Ema:
Yes. She came to a short while ago. You found her before it was too late.
Trucy:
Th-That's good to hear...
Apollo:
So, what happened!?
Ema:
Someone attacked her. ...She was struck on the forehead.
Apollo:
By who!?
Ema:
We don't know.
Trucy:
But they hit her on the forehead, right? That's right in front of her! How could she not see... Oh.
Ema:
Right. Would you like to see her now?
Apollo:
Is that alright?
Ema:
She wants to thank you for saving her life.
Apollo:
Lamiroir!
Lamiroir:
Ah, Mr. Attorney. You were the one who found me? Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Apollo:
I-I'm just glad you're OK. Tell me, what happened?
Lamiroir:
......
Examine
Hallway
Apollo:
The door down the hall reads "X-ray Room". I never did like X-rays... I don't think I'd enjoy looking at someone's insides. Spotting nervous tics is intense enough.
Man on crutches
Apollo:
That must be a recovering patient. He keeps staring at us. What's so unusual about an attorney and a magician?
Reception desk
Apollo:
A nurse watches, hawk-like, from the reception desk. She glares at me whenever I talk. Maybe my voice carries?
Waiting area
Apollo:
Some visitors are here in the waiting room, watching TV.
TV:
"...murder during a concert at Sunshine Coliseum..."
Apollo:
Huh, looks like we're on the news.
TV:
"...with his current hit song, "Guilty Love", is in the courtroom as prosecutor... ...singing the defendant all the way to death row..."
Apollo:
...... Prosecutor Gavin this, Prosecutor Gavin that! Where's my fifteen minutes!?
TV:
"...The Guitar's Serenade... On sale now!"
Talk
Attacked!
Lamiroir:
It was after I spoke with you in front of the dressing room. I sensed someone approaching. I thought it might be someone come to see me, but they said nothing. When I went to return to my dressing room...
Apollo:
...You were hit?
Lamiroir:
I knew, that very moment, I knew! The assailant... was trying to kill me.
Trucy:
Ack!
Lamiroir:
It was lucky for me the first blow did not knock me out. I turned and ran for the stage. Someone was chasing me, I could hear footsteps... Yet I reached the stage first.
Apollo:
Why the stage?
Lamiroir:
I had overheard maintenance people talking. The power to the stage area was off, they said, for electrical work.
Trucy:
Ah...
Lamiroir:
Darkness is my ally. There was a contrabass case near the stage. That is where I hid.
Apollo:
So the assailant couldn't see you!
Lamiroir:
Once in the case... I'm afraid I passed out.
Apollo:
Wow, that sounds like a really close call.
The assailant
Apollo:
Do you have any idea who it might have been?
Lamiroir:
Unfortunately, no. Whoever it was, they said not a word.
Apollo:
Too bad...
Lamiroir:
Yet, when I consider that I was struck high on the forehead... I must conclude that whoever hit me was taller than I am.
Apollo:
Good point... (She's sharp!)
Trucy:
And you're much taller than I am. You're about as tall as Apollo.
Apollo:
So, that means it was likely an adult, and probably a man. (...Could it be him!?)
Trucy:
But why would anyone attack you, Lamiroir!?
Lamiroir:
The detective asked me this, too. And to her I gave the same answer I give you: I do not know.
Apollo:
Hmm...
The Borginian Cocoon (appears after presenting Replica)
Lamiroir:
Well, they call it "Borginian"... It must only be found in Borginia. For certain, all in Borginia know of these.
Trucy:
It's a cocoon... so, do you get silk from it?
Lamiroir:
I do not know the details, I am sorry to say.
Apollo:
(I thought she said all in Borginia knew of these?)
Lamiroir:
There is one fact I do know about the cocoon, though. Something all in Borginia know.
Apollo:
...What's that?
Lamiroir:
The cocoons... They are not to be taken out of the country. If someone does, and is caught, they will be put to death.
Trucy:
T-T-T-To death!?
Apollo:
Why!?
Lamiroir:
I do not know. Yet, if Interpol was involved... ...I'm sure there is a good reason.
Trucy:
But this is just a piece of plastic!
Apollo:
He was carrying a replica... but looking for the real deal. That's my best guess.
Trucy:
So, that's what he was up to?
Apollo:
Tracking down Borginian Cocoon smuggling...
Trucy:
Smuggling...
Smuggling (appears after "The Borginian Cocoon")
Lamiroir:
It seems I was "marked".
Trucy:
"Marked"...?
Lamiroir:
Life changed for me with the popularity of my songs. I began to travel around the world.
Trucy:
Ah! So you could have brought those Borginian Cocoons with you...
Lamiroir:
...On my trips, yes. That was probably the suspicion.
Apollo:
And Mr. LeTouse was placed as an undercover agent to look into it.
Lamiroir:
Borginia is a small, sheltered country. Not many of our people venture into the world outside.
Trucy:
Is that why they suspected you?
Apollo:
But... Mr. LeTouse wasn't a Borginian, was he. He was an Interpol agent, which means...
Trucy:
What, Apollo?
Apollo:
Well, there must have been some reason other countries didn't want the cocoons out. Something scary enough to get Interpol involved.
Trucy:
Huh? Like what? How could such a tiny ball of thread cause such a commotion?
Present
Replica
Apollo:
Ah, Lamiroir, I wanted to ask you about this. Do you know what this is?
Lamiroir:
This... this is what?
Apollo:
Mr. LeTouse was carrying it. It's a replica of the thing he was after.
Lamiroir:
He was "after"...?
Trucy:
You know, in his secret identity! As an undercover agent!
Lamiroir:
...So that's what he was doing.
Apollo:
...! You mean, you know what...
Lamiroir:
Yes, I know, of course. This must be... ...a Borginian Cocoon. ...Or rather a convincing replica thereof.
Apollo:
(Why haven't I heard of a Borginian Cocoon before?)
Trucy:
Why would he be carrying this around? Was it some kind of souvenir?
Lamiroir:
I wonder...
Anything else
Lamiroir:
I'm sorry, I'm not quite recovered from the attack...
Apollo:
(She looks like she's had a rough day... I'll just put this piece of evidence away for later.)
After clearing all "Talk" options:
Apollo:
(Cocoon smuggling... And Mr. LeTouse had Lamiroir marked... Hmm...) ...It couldn't be her.
Trucy:
Huh?
Apollo:
(There's one other person I need to talk to!) Thank you for talking to us, Lamiroir!
Lamiroir:
It was the least I could do.
Apollo:
Actually, I have another request.
Lamiroir:
If it is within my power...
Apollo:
I need an interpreter. Someone who speaks Borginian.
Trucy:
Apollo...?
Lamiroir:
......
Apollo:
Would you come with us, if you're well enough?
Lamiroir:
I see... Yes, yes of course. I shall accompany you.
Trucy:
Huh? Where are we going?
Apollo:
C'mon, Trucy. We're about to get to the bottom of this!
The stage
Examine
Guitar case
Apollo:
The giant instrument case that Lamiroir was hiding in. Things like this wouldn't happen if people didn't make such big cases!
Trucy:
...I'm not sure the case is to blame here, Apollo. We have to find whoever did this to her. No one hits a siren of the ballad on my watch and gets away with it!
Apollo:
Don't worry. We'll find her assailant.
July 9Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Apollo:
Machi... We came to talk to you about the case.
Lamiroir:
Machi...
Machi:
!................
Apollo:
Could you interpret for us, Lamiroir?
Lamiroir:
Yes.
Apollo:
Machi... I'd like to talk to you about when we first met. ...When we still thought you were blind.
Lamiroir:
[Borginese speaking]....
Machi:
....................
Apollo:
Now we know the truth. You can see, right?
Trucy:
I was completely fooled, myself.
Apollo:
Machi... Isn't there another secret you're hiding from us?
Machi:
......!
Lamiroir:
Wait, Mr. Attorney! What do you mean by "secret"?
Machi:
............
Apollo:
What do I mean by "secret"? Well...
Present Replica
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"If I'm not mistaken..."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
Do you know what this is?
Machi:
................[Borginese speaking]
Lamiroir:
Ah, Mr. Attorney...
Apollo:
I don't need a translation to understand that. I'd know that "wrong evidence" look anywhere.
Lamiroir:
I'd imagine you would.
Apollo:
(Ugh, let's try that again.)
Leads back to:
"What do I mean by "secret"? Well..."
Apollo:
If I'm not mistaken... ...you know something about this, don't you!?
Machi:
......!
Trucy:
Hey, you got a reaction! A big one!
Lamiroir:
Machi, you didn't...!
Apollo:
...Trucy and I are trained to see people's uncertainty. Not that we would have needed any training to see that one.
Machi:
....................
Lamiroir:
Mr. Attorney, please tell me what this is all about!
Apollo:
Lamiroir, please, interpret!
Lamiroir:
...Very well.
Apollo:
I know you know something about this by your reaction. If you won't tell me, I might have to give it to the prosecution... ...and have them look into it!
Machi:
! .................... [Borginese speaking]!
Lamiroir:
He asks you to "wait, do not be so hasty."
Trucy:
M-Machi...?
Machi:
.................... [Borginese speaking]....[Borginese speaking]?
Lamiroir:
"Do you know everything?"
Apollo:
...Yes, everything. Well, sort of.
Trucy:
Have him tell us about it!
Machi:
....[Borginese speaking]....
Lamiroir:
"Very well"...
Talk
The Cocoon
Leads to:
"What is this cocoon, anyway?"
Present
Anything
Machi:
....................
Lamiroir:
Machi, he is upset he could not speak with you.
Trucy:
Well, let's hear him out before he gets grumpy, Apollo!
Trucy:
What is this cocoon, anyway?
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]....
Lamiroir:
"The cocoon, the silk, is a potent cure."
Trucy:
A cure...?
Apollo:
It must cure some disease.
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]....
Lamiroir:
It's a cure for "Incuritis".
Apollo:
A cure for Incuritis?
Replica updated in the Court Record.
Trucy:
But, if it's a cure, why keep it in Borginia like that? Just think of all the lives they could save by sharing the medicine!
Machi:
....................
Lamiroir:
I do not understand the reasons myself.
Apollo:
OK, well, at least we know what it is: a cure. And Mr. LeTouse was after cocoon smugglers. Wait, was Machi...?
Lamiroir:
Machi, you weren't...!
Trucy:
He couldn't be a smuggler! He's so little!
Apollo:
Well, you're only 15, and you're sort of a magician, aren't you?
Trucy:
Well, that's true. I am sort of a magician.
Apollo:
(She said "sort of"! Oh, to have a copy of that security camera tape...)
Trucy:
Well, Machi? Are you... a smuggler?
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]....
Lamiroir:
[Borginese speaking]!
Machi:
....................
Lamiroir:
He... won't tell me.
Trucy:
First he plays blind, now he plays dumb...
Apollo:
I wonder... Do you think he brought a cocoon here to sell it to someone? If Machi really did bring one into the country... ...was he planning on making a deal for its sale?
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]....
Lamiroir:
"I can't go home"...
Trucy:
Can't go home!?
Machi:
....[Borginese speaking]....[Borginese speaking] ....[Borginese speaking]....
Lamiroir:
"I can't go home to Borginia. I do not want to go home." The penalty for taking a cocoon from Borginia... is death.
Apollo:
(That's right! It's punishable by death!)
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]........
Lamiroir:
"About the case..."? What about the case?
Apollo:
(He wants to tell us about Mr. LeTouse's death!?)
Machi:
[Borginese speaking], [Borginese speaking]....
???:
This meeting's over.
Trucy:
...Daryan?
Apollo:
Wh-What do you mean? Visiting hours aren't over yet.
Daryan:
There's a call for Machi from the Borginian Embassy. This meeting is over. ...Sorry.
Apollo:
Just give us five more minutes. We can call them back after that.
Daryan:
Sorry, no go. C'mon, piano-boy. We're leaving.
Trucy:
Daryan! Wait!
Daryan:
...I never liked you. Either of you.
Apollo:
Huh...?
Trucy:
Darn it! We were so close! He was about to tell us! Hey, Apollo...
Apollo:
(He didn't want us to hear what Machi had to say...)
Trucy:
Apollo!
Apollo:
(...And there can be only one reason why.)
Trucy:
Why is everyone ignoring me!?
Apollo:
Oh, sorry! (This is it... I know who I'm after now. It all happens tomorrow... in court!)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Apollo:
No clues here.
