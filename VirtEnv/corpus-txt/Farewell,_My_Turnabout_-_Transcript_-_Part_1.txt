Episode 4Farewell, My Turnabout
Now! The moment you've all been waiting for! Who will be this year's Grand Prix Champion? Who will be our "Hero of Heroes"!? Will it be last year's runner-up, Jammin' Ninja!? Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope lady luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix...
IS ME!!
Whoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!
March 20, 7:42 PMGatewater HotelViola Hall
Maya:
Alright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!
Phoenix:
Yeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.
Powers:
Ah, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.
Pearl:
U-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?
Maya:
Yup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? "The Nickel Samurai"!
Pearl:
No. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's "Kids' Masterpiece Theatre".
Maya:
OK, that's it! From now on, it's "The Nickel Samurai"! All the kids watch it!
Pearl:
Do you like "The Nickel Samurai" too, Mr. Nick?
Maya:
Nah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.
Phoenix:
That's right. But I do like "Kids' Masterpiece Theatre".
Maya:
Hey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.
Maya:
Aw, give it a rest, Pearly!
Powers:
Looks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.
Maya:
Aaaaah... It's like a dream!
Powers:
Too bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...
Maya:
Yeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?
Pearl:
Different? What do you mean?
Maya:
Um, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.
Powers:
Hey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.
Phoenix:
(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.
Powers:
A-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.
Powers:
And then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.
Phoenix:
A press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?
Powers:
Uh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai confessing something.
Phoenix:
Confessing...? Sounds pretty serious.
Maya:
Argh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?
Pearl:
Yeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?
Phoenix:
(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)
Examine
Doors on the left
Phoenix:
There's a grand set of doors over there.
Powers:
And behind those doors is an equally grand lobby.
Pearl:
Shall we go and take a look, Mr. Nick?
Maya:
Hey, wait up! This grand dessert is calling to me... It's saying, "Eat me now!"
Walls or ceiling
Phoenix:
This sure is one luxurious hotel. Almost to the point of gaudy, with how it blends together everything "fancy" imaginable. (Speaking of fancy, didn't that bellboy give me something like that last year?)
Chandelier
Maya:
That chandelier is really something, isn't it?
Pearl:
I thought it was a kind of space ship...
Maya:
Hey, Nick. How about we get one of these for the office?
Phoenix:
One of those hanging from our poor, weak ceiling? I don't think so.
Tables at the back
Maya:
If this is all a dream, I don't ever want to wake up! And all the directors and stars that were here to see the heroes, wow.
Phoenix:
I had no idea who most of them were.
Pearl:
Neither did I.
Maya:
Nick, you've got to cut that "news only" habit out. Your new show is going to be "The Nickel Samurai!" Every Sunday morning at 8! Oh, I know! We can watch it together starting next week! I'll come wake you up extra early to make sure, OK?
Phoenix:
Ah, I'm fine... You know, you really don't have to on my account...
Stage
Phoenix:
The awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.
Pearl:
You just reminded me of the circus for a second.
Maya:
Well, shows like that are guaranteed to be good, you know?
Front table
Maya:
What can I say? This is a really high-class hotel!
Pearl:
I've never eaten this kind of salad before.
Phoenix:
(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)
Maya:
Don't worry! Any leftovers belong in my happily awaiting stomach anyway!
Phoenix:
You're such a glutton, Maya.
Powers:
Ah, I lose this one to Maya. You sure can eat.
Maya:
Well, a growing girl needs her nutrients!
Phoenix:
(A growing girl? Exactly how big do you plan on getting...?)
Talk
Will Powers
Phoenix:
Thank you very much for inviting us today.
Powers:
Aww, it was nothing really. Guys like us don't get to come to a place like this often, so I thought I'd invite you all.
Maya:
Hey, Mr. Powers! What have you been up to lately?
Powers:
Well, since "The Pink Princess" successfully wrapped up last month, I've been on a kid's exercise show... ...while wearing a rabbit mask over my face...
Maya:
Oh, I see.
Powers:
I'm still really sorry about all the headaches I caused you that time, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Ah, well. What's done is done, so let's forget about it. (This is Will Powers. He's an action star. His popularity exploded when he was the Steel Samurai. And he was the first case Maya worked on with me.)
Maya:
You can't tell by looking at you, but you're a really nice guy with a love of kids.
Powers:
Ah, thanks.
The Nickel Samurai
Phoenix:
I can't believe they're going to make a movie based on the Nickel Samurai.
Maya:
I can't believe it either, but for a different reason!
Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai. An epic story of one hero in a desperate fight against his arch-enemy, the Evil Magistrate in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo. And last year, they started a new series, "The Nickel Samurai". The new series seems to be a hit with the kids too.
Powers:
The Steel Samurai is a show I have a lot of strong feelings for, so I hoped that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one...
Maya:
Yeah... It's too bad... It'd be great to see you on the show... With the new actor, Matt Engarde. He's super popular right now.
Pearl:
Mr. Un-gard...?
Phoenix:
(Looks like Pearls doesn't know who he is.)
Maya:
This year it's going to be the Nickel Samurai vs. the Jammin' Ninja at the box office!
Phoenix:
...Jammin' Ninja...? Who's that again?
Jammin' Ninja (appears after The Nickel Samurai)
Phoenix:
So who is this "Jammin' Ninja" again?
Maya:
He's a hero, duh. His symbol is a bright red guitar he's always carrying.
Phoenix:
(A ninja who's always carrying around a bright red guitar...? How does that even work!?)
Maya:
With a scarf around his neck and a guitar in hand, he rises to stardom in an ancient time.
Phoenix:
A ninja... Who becomes a star??
Maya:
Yeah! A ninja who becomes a star!
Powers:
There's a strong rivalry between the two of them. Global Studios' Nickel Samurai and Worldwide Studios' Jammin' Ninja. They even air at the same time.
Maya:
You know what I heard? I heard those two don't get along at all. The Nickel Samurai's Engarde and the guy who plays the Jammin' Ninja, I mean.
Phoenix:
(The Nickel Samurai speaks French!? Oh, you mean Matt Engarde, the actor...) I guess even the world of heroes isn't a sparkling, happy place.
Powers:
Y-Yeah...
Present
Attorney's Badge
Powers:
Ah, I really owe you one. If it wasn't for you guys, I don't know what would've happened. What you did... It was a real tight spot I was in, and you fought so hard to get me out. I don't care what happens. I'll never forget everything you've done for me.
Maya Fey profile
Powers:
So, you're going to study to become a lawyer too. Am I right or am I right?
Maya:
Umm...
Powers:
It must be real tough. There's all those thick books with hard words you have to read...
Maya:
Uh, um... Well...
Phoenix:
(Oh, yeah. Mr. Powers doesn't know that Maya's a spirit medium...)
Maya:
I thought he'd be able to tell by my clothes.
Phoenix:
Maybe he thinks that you've got some strange hobby on the side or something.
Maya:
...Hey, wait a sec. What's that's supposed to mean!?
Pearl Fey profile
Powers:
So are you Maya's little sister?
Pearl:
I'm sorry, but no.
Powers:
Oh, then you must be Mr. Wright's little sister!
Pearl:
Again, I'm sorry, but...
Powers:
Then... Whose little sister are you?
Pearl:
I'm sorry, but I'm an only child.
Powers:
Oh, I see... S-Sorry.
Phoenix:
(Pearl looks so sad... She looks really sorry too...)
Will Powers profile
Powers:
Hey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, they're all shocked because then they figure out who I am.
Maya:
Hmm... Well, I don't think you look scary.
Pearl:
Me either. I think your face makes you look like a very kind person!
Powers:
...!
Phoenix:
(Aww... Those two are making Mr. Powers tear up...)
Anything else
Powers:
S-Sorry. Thanks for taking the time to take it out and show it to me, but I'm really sorry, I don't know a thing about it.

Hallway

Gatewater Hotel
Hallway
March 20Gatewater HotelHallway
Phoenix:
Wow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...
Examine
Teddy bear
Phoenix:
I can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Could it be that there's an action star who has a soft spot for teddy bears...? ...Nah, can't be.
Flowers on left
Phoenix:
Compared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...
Door on left
Phoenix:
There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, "Juan Corrida's Room". "Juan Corrida"... His name just sounds like a star's name. I've heard it before, but I don't know anything about him at all.
End of hallway
Phoenix:
There are toilets in each room in this hotel, but since all sorts of events are held here, there are bathrooms for people who aren't staying here to use as well. Perfect for people like me, who can't afford a stay here in the first place...
Flowers on right
Phoenix:
"To Mr. Engarde From the Global Studio Staff" Ah, it'd be nice if lawyers got flowers too. Something like, "To Mr. Wright From All Your Grateful Clients".
Door on right
Phoenix:
There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, "Matt Engarde's Room". "Matt Engarde"... I've heard that name before. Oh, yeah. Maya's always yammering about him like the obsessed fan she is...
Viola Hall
(Clearing all "Talk" options and visiting Hallway leads to:)
Powers:
Sounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.
Maya:
Alright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? "Nickel Samurai Smelting!"
Powers:
Actually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.
Maya:
You mean the "big confession" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?
Powers:
Uh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.
Maya:
Bah.
Powers:
S-Sorry.
Powers:
Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?
Maya:
Yeah, of course!
Powers:
If that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.
Press Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Thank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.
Pearl:
It looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!
Maya:
OK! For great justice!
Present
Press Conference Ticket
Powers:
They called this so suddenly that something about it just seems off, you know?
Phoenix:
You mean the press conference?
Powers:
Yeah. He said, "There's something I'd like to confess if I win." I heard he faxed his request for a conference in to the office only yesterday.
Phoenix:
Yesterday... (Yeah, that is kind of sudden.)
Powers:
But I guess his manager set everything up somehow, so he was lucky.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Nice manager.

Phoenix:
Hmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.
Pearl:
Ah, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.
Phoenix:
They're using a compact stage, I see.
Maya:
Ooh... I'm all ready to use my special "Samurai Power".
Phoenix:
(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)
PA Notice:
Your attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.
Maya:
WHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?
Phoenix:
Oww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!
PA Notice:
We are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.
Pearl:
...!
Phoenix:
P-Police? Did they just say the police?
Powers:
D-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?
Phoenix:
Um, wait, I'll come with you...
???:
Freeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!
Maya:
Th-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...
???:
Honestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, "Beware, Bridge Out!" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the "in" part of the bridge since the "out" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!
Powers:
This non-stop chatter...
Phoenix:
I-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?
???:
...
Oldbag:
What is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?
Powers:
Y-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...
Oldbag:
You didn't get nominated last year either, did you? Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.
Powers:
Ah, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...
Oldbag:
I love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the "big brother" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face. What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...
Phoenix:
Um... What are you doing here?
Oldbag:
Look at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!
Maya:
But that outfit...
Oldbag:
Annoying, noisy brats get the blaster!
Ray Gun:
*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*
Examine
Second floor
Maya:
Wow, it looks like there's a fancy restaurant on the second floor!
Phoenix:
You STILL feel like eating?
Maya:
I mean, since we're here, you know?
Phoenix:
(Don't pull the "since we're here" trick on me...)
Pearl:
What a beautiful mansion. Do you live in this wonderful world every day, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, this is my first time in a place like this.
Camera
Phoenix:
I'm going to say these cameras were set up to cover the post-ceremony stage show.
Maya:
But I wonder where everyone's gone, abandoning their cameras like this...
Phoenix:
(I guess something big must have happened...)
Stage
Phoenix:
It's the stage for the post-ceremony stage show.
Powers:
There was supposed to be a press meeting after the show, but now...
Phoenix:
It looks like no one will hear what the Nickel Samurai had to confess after all.
Seats
Maya:
We're here, so we might as well take some pictures. OK, everyone, sit in a chair!
Phoenix:
But we're all out of film...
Maya:
Don't worry about it. There's a zillion cameras over there we can borrow.
Phoenix:
Hey, hey! You can't just go and "borrow" an expensive professional camera like that!
Talk
Wendy Oldbag
Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?
Oldbag:
Oh, that old place? Well, since "that" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.
Maya:
What incident? What did you do?
Oldbag:
I didn't do anything, you young'un! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah...
Oldbag:
And you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me; this fragile girl at heart!?
Phoenix:
Um... I plead the fifth.
Oldbag:
But you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!
Phoenix:
M-Me!?
Oldbag:
I thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.
Maya:
You? A bodyguard?
Oldbag:
For your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.
Maya:
M-Mr. Edgeworth?
Oldbag:
But...
Edgeworth:
That sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.
Oldbag:
That's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?
Ray Gun:
*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*
What happened?
Maya:
Um... So, did something happen?
Oldbag:
I don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those "incidents" happened again.
Powers:
A-An "incident"? Like a "murder" kind of "incident"?
Oldbag:
Maybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!
Phoenix:
Um, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?
Oldbag:
Silence, whippersnapper!
Ray Gun:
*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*
Present
Anything
Oldbag:
These eyes of mine are real pros now!
Phoenix:
"Pros"? Pros at doing what?
Oldbag:
At doing police work, of course! My eyes are like a hawk! And my professional eyes spot a messy incident! A messy, bloody incident! That's why I don't have time for you meddling kids and your petty little things!

...Hey, Nick.
Phoenix:
Wh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...
Maya:
Let's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!
Phoenix:
N-No way. The police told us not go anywhere, remember?
Maya:
Huh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!
Pearl:
Huh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)
Maya:
So listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...
Phoenix:
O-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.
Maya:
Yay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!
Pearl:
That's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)
Maya:
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.
Pearl:
Goody! I get to come! I get to come!
March 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall
Phoenix:
There's nothing really out of the ordinary here...
Pearl:
Are you looking for the "something" that the old lady was talking about?
Phoenix:
Doesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.
Maya:
Alright! Then, let's try...
Bellboy:
Excuse me.
Maya:
Ack!
Bellboy:
Are you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?
Maya:
Um, yeah... That's me.
Bellboy:
You have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.
Maya:
A call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...
Pearl:
What's wrong, Mystic Maya?
Maya:
Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?
Pearl:
OK.
Bellboy:
Right this way, Ms. Fey.
Pearl:
Let's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.
Phoenix:
Yeah, OK.
Pearl:
This is a little exciting... And a little scary...
Examine
Doors on left
Phoenix:
There's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of.
Chandelier
Pearl:
So, that's called a "shan-deh leer", right?
Phoenix:
Yup.
Pearl:
What is that for? What does it do?
Phoenix:
Well, it's for lighting up a room, Pearls.
Pearl:
Um, Mr. Nick? Can I look down now? My neck hurts...
Tables at the back
Phoenix:
They haven't cleaned up all the food yet. There's a sad feeling hanging in the air now that the party is over...
Stage
Phoenix:
The awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.
Pearl:
You just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.
Phoenix:
(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.
Front table
Pearl:
It's a feast fit for a king!
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Pearl:
It was the first time I ate that food. What was it called again? I think it started with "key". Key... Wee?
Phoenix:
That's right, a "kiwi".
Pearl:
I don't know what to say. It's a sweet but sour fruit all in one.
Phoenix:
(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)

Phoenix:
A lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. But right now, the only thing filling this enormous room is anxiety about the murder. ...I really hope nothing else bad happens here...
Camera
Phoenix:
These cameras must belong to the press that came to cover the conference. They're all basically doing the same thing: staring at the empty stage.

Phoenix:
Seats for the spectators of the post-ceremony show and the press conference. But it's too bad neither event is going to be held now.

What's yer problem!? Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! "Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!" You'll see! I'll git ya back!

Hey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...
Pearl:
A... A murder!?
Gumshoe:
Aw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!
Lotta:
See! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so!
Lotta:
I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!

Ah, no, that's not it. I got my facts mixed up for a second there, pal.

Phoenix:
Huh? Why do you ask?
Pearl:
Well, Mystic Maya was rooting for him, so...
Gumshoe:
It wasn't the Nickel Samurai that got bumped. Actually, the Nickel Samurai is the one under suspicion of doing the bumping off...
Phoenix:
What?
Gumshoe:
The guy that died was this hero named the Jammin' Ninja, pal.
Phoenix:
The Jammin' Ninja...
Lotta Hart
Pearl:
Um, that woman with the big puffy hair that looks like cotton candy...
Phoenix:
You mean Lotta?
Pearl:
That woman... She was there that time too, right?
Phoenix:
That time?
Pearl:
...When Mystic Maya did that channeling...
Phoenix:
Oh, that time... Well, Lotta's a journalist, so that's why she was there.
Pearl:
Jer-nal-ist...
Gumshoe:
It looks like she was hanging around here before the murder happened.
Phoenix:
"Hanging around"...?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, hiding in wait in front of the Jammin' Ninja's door, pal.
Phoenix:
B-But why would she...?
Gumshoe:
She wouldn't tell me, pal. Just said something about "Gettin' my big scoop"...
Phoenix:
(Scoop? What sort of news could she be after...?)
The victim (appears after What happened)
Phoenix:
So the victim was the Jammin' Ninja?
Pearl:
Mr. Jammin' Ninja...?
Gumshoe:
He was on a really popular rival TV show to "The Nickel Samurai".
Pearl:
Oh...
Gumshoe:
The victim was the action star, Juan Corrida. He got a huge push and rode the express train to stardom. I mean, even I know who he is!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, even I recognize his face...)
Gumshoe:
But I heard lately that Matt Engarde's been taking the wind out of his sail. I'm telling you, pal, as far as who's popular, those two are hogging all the limelight.
Phoenix:
(I guess there's no space for Mr. Powers at all, huh... Poor guy...)
Pearl:
Mr. Engarde... Um... That's the Nickel Samurai, right...?
Gumshoe:
Yup. I mean, no! You've got to say it with more umph! "The Nickel Samurai!"
Phoenix:
...Anyway, so now that Juan Corrida's gone, that means Mr. Engarde has the whole stage to himself, wouldn't you say?
Gumshoe:
I wouldn't bet on it, pal. We can't have that happen, you know?
Phoenix:
"Can't have that happen"? (What's that supposed to mean, I wonder...)
Arrested? (after presenting Matt Engarde profile)
Phoenix:
Wh-Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?
Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal, but that's not something I can tell you. We just started the investigation, so we don't want any leaks.
Phoenix:
(Looks like yet another "Steel Samurai" hero is in hot water...)
Pearl:
Um... Mr. Nick... If Mystic Maya knew about this...
Phoenix:
Yeah, I know. She'd make me take this case... I know...

Maya Fey profile
Gumshoe:
I was really shocked by what happened to her in that one case. I didn't know she had such an awesome power!
Pearl:
Awesome power...?
Gumshoe:
I thought maybe I should do some self-improvement and take up a hobby. So I went out and bought some Morning Glory seeds and planted them, pal.
Phoenix:
...That's a good way to improve yourself.
Gumshoe:
Ho ho ho. Well, it's nothing really...
Lotta Hart profile
Gumshoe:
That girl is number three on my "People I've Seen A Lot Of Lately" list.
Phoenix:
Oh? Then who's number one...?
Gumshoe:
As if you need to ask. It's YOU, pal!
Phoenix:
A-Ah... So who's number two?
Gumshoe:
Maya Fey. ...But it looks like she's not around this time.
Pearl:
It must be nice to be such good friends with each other, isn't it Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
(Somehow, I don't think that's the real meaning of Detective Gumshoe's list...)
Dick Gumshoe profile
Gumshoe:
I look good! I think I've lost some weight, pal!
Phoenix:
It's only wishful thinking.
Gumshoe:
Wishful thinking, huh? ... In that case, I wishfully think I've lost some weight!
Phoenix:
(I wishfully think he might face the facts one day...)
Gumshoe:
Lately, I've been on the instant noodles only diet, pal!
Juan Corrida profile
Gumshoe:
I'm not a real fan of action shows or anything... But I know who Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde are.
Phoenix:
You can't talk about one without talking about the other, I guess.
Gumshoe:
They even debuted around the same time. So they have this real fiery rivalry with each other. Kinda like you and me, pal!
Phoenix:
(I never knew he thought of me as a rival...)
Matt Engarde profile
Gumshoe:
The Nickel Samurai! He really took the Grand Prix tonight!
Phoenix:
Maya's a big fan of his.
Gumshoe:
Really? ...Oh, I'm sorry then.
Pearl:
Why are you sorry?
Gumshoe:
Matt Engarde was just arrested, pal. ...On suspicion of murdering Juan Corrida.
Pearl:
What!?
Any other evidence
Phoenix:
Would you take a look at this for me?
Gumshoe:
Listen, pal... I'm not leaking any info about the evidence to you this time. If I do, my salary's really gonna get it... And then I won't even be able to get those instant noodles down at the discount market!
Any other profile
Phoenix:
Do you know this person?
Gumshoe:
You meet a lot of people as a detective, pal. So we make extra sure to not forget people because that's our job. ...Now, having said that, I don't remember ever seeing this person before.
Pearl:
Which means that you're kind of forgetful, aren't you Mr. Detective?
Gumshoe:
That's not what it means... Not exactly anyway...

Powers:
Hey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
It looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.
Powers:
Wh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?
Phoenix:
It looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.
Powers:
Y-You're joking, right!?
Phoenix:
Nope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.
Powers:
Ooogh... Not again... I feel sick.
Pearl:
"Again"...?
Phoenix:
...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.
Powers:
I still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...
Phoenix:
(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)
Powers:
...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.
Radio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.
Phoenix:
...For me...? But why?
Powers:
I don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.
Talk
Matt and Juan
Powers:
Matt is the most energetic and active actor out there right now. The Nickel Samurai really sealed his place as a pop idol, but... he kept adding fuel to the fire of his rivalry with Juan anyway.
Pearl:
Mr. Juan... He's the Jammin' Ninja, right?
Powers:
Those two would butt heads over everything they could think of. But I'd say that Matt was the one who almost always came out on top.
Phoenix:
(I guess some people only know how to relate to others by butting heads like a ram...)
Powers:
Juan said that he'd take Matt on this time too, so he joined a rival TV show.
Pearl:
And that was "The Jammin' Ninja"...?
Powers:
The stylish Nickel Samurai and the burning Jammin' Ninja... Well, things turned messy real fast with those two using their shows for their "war". And the final tally... Look around... It's pretty obvious how things ended up.
Phoenix:
(Matt even won the Grand Prix this year... The final win over his rival, I guess...)
Press conference
Phoenix:
Mr. Engarde was going to hold a press conference, wasn't he?
Powers:
That's what I heard. Though if you wanted to get technical about it, it was the Nickel Samurai's conference.
Phoenix:
The Nickel Samurai's...?
Powers:
Yeah. He was supposed to wear his costume and give the press conference that way.
Phoenix:
So he was supposed to be in-costume...? But why?
Powers:
I'm not sure... They don't keep me in the loop anymore.
Present
Radio Transceiver
Powers:
It was almost right after you guys left. An old man who's a bellboy at this hotel showed up.
Phoenix:
And that's when he told you to give this to me...?
Powers:
Yeah...
Phoenix:
(Why... Why give me this transceiver...?)
Maya Fey profile
Powers:
Hey, where did Maya go off to?
Phoenix:
She got a phone call.
Powers:
Oh yeah, that's right. She was heading for the front desk just now. She sure stands out in a crowd, doesn't she?
Will Powers profile
Powers:
Hey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, then they're all shocked because they figure out who I am...
Pearl:
I think your face makes you look like a very kind person!
Powers:
...!
Phoenix:
(Aww... Mr. Powers is getting teary eyed.)
Juan Corrida profile
Powers:
He debuted around the same time as Matt in everything, you know.
Pearl:
Really?
Powers:
Yeah, it started out small... First it was singing contests, then swimming competitions... Then it was bowling tournaments, and then it was who could throw the best New Year's parties... Juan was always trying to one-up Matt. But lately, those two were escalating to more and more dangerous things... I thought that no good would come of it all, so I began to worry.
Phoenix:
(Too bad Juan's story ended so soon...)
Matt Engarde profile
Powers:
Matt's younger than me, but you can practically see his star potential.
Pearl:
His star po-ten-shial...?
Powers:
I got his autograph the other day.
Phoenix:
...Feels kind of wrong now, doesn't it?
Powers:
I don't care what people say! Matt didn't kill Juan! I know he didn't!
Any other profile
Powers:
Umm... I'm honored you're asking me, But I have no idea who this person is. Umm... Sorry...
Phoenix:
Ah, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much.
Powers:
S-Sorry.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Pearl:
Um... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.
Phoenix:
(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)
Pearl:
Maybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.

Huh? I... I'm not sure... (Did this transceiver just...?)

Phoenix:
Y-Yes, hello? Wright here...
???:
Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?
Phoenix:
And you are...!?
???:
You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...
Maya:
Heeelp! Niiiiick!
Pearl:
M-Mystic Maya!
Phoenix:
Maya...?
???:
So, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?
Phoenix:
(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?
???:
Come now. Don't fall apart on me yet.
Phoenix:
(Th-This... No! This can't be!)
???:
Now that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable "item" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?
Phoenix:
..."Kidnapping for ransom"...
???:
Yes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.
Pearl:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
Phoenix:
(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)
???:
You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?
Phoenix:
H-How much!? How much do you want!?
???:
Very good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.
Phoenix:
Hurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya --
???:
Money is not what I seek.
Phoenix:
...What?
???:
What I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.
Phoenix:
Complete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?
???:
I am not the person you will be representing.
Phoenix:
What...?
???:
You are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.
Phoenix:
Juan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...
???:
You are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.
Phoenix:
M-Matt Engarde? But why?
???:
He did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...
Phoenix:
H-However!? However what!?
???:
However, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...
Phoenix:
... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)
???:
You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not. However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious "item" is with me, in my possession.
Maya:
Mmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!
Phoenix:
Maya!
???:
You have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
O-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?
???:
Yes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.
Phoenix:
Aagh!
???:
Oh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, "And don't even think about callin' the cops!" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.
Phoenix:
D-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?
???:
Alright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.
...*beep*...
Phoenix:

Pearl:
M-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?
Phoenix:
...She's been kidnapped.
Pearl:
N-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!
Phoenix:
It's not your fault, Pearls.
Pearl:
But it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Powers:
Mr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!
Phoenix:
(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?
Phoenix:
(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!
Powers:
Alright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!
Gumshoe:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?
Phoenix:
Shhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.
Gumshoe:
Wait, the deal is "complete acquittal" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!
Phoenix:
But the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...
Gumshoe:
You really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?
Phoenix:
(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)
Gumshoe:
And on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.
Phoenix:
Umm...
Gumshoe:
But it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.
Phoenix:
There's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being "set-up"...?)
Gumshoe:
Anyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.
Phoenix:
...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)
Gumshoe:
We've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.

"D-De Killer"!? You mean like an "ASSASSIN"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)
???:
Don't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.
Maya:
A-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...
???:
Yes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Maya:
...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?
???:
Calm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.
Maya:
A... A business transaction?
???:
I am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.
Maya:

Phoenix:

Pearl:
Mr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!?
Phoenix:
Yeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.

Um, but what if... What if he... ...is the real murderer? What would you do then, Mr. Nick...?

Would you fight to get a not guilty for a murderer to save Mystic Maya...?
Phoenix:
Pearls... Let's talk to Mr. Engarde first, OK? ...We can think all the bad things we want, but it doesn't change a thing.

Sorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions.
Engarde:
Um, that's OK, but dude, my autobiography's coming out soon, so... If I say stuff without the publisher's approval, then I'm gonna be in real hot water... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my publisher, OK? ... ...
Pearl:
Mr. Engarde is so lucky! He has so many people he can talk to.
Phoenix:
(Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...)
Engarde:
Sorry about that. Like I thought, the publisher said it'd be "real bad" if I said anything, dude.
Phoenix:
(Does he have a mind of his own!?)
What happened
Phoenix:
Mr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder...
Engarde:
Oh, are you covering this for a tabloid as a side job, dude? Um, um... Well, if you want my statement on this, you should ask through my staff...
Phoenix:
No no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid...
Engarde:

Engarde:
Sorry about that. The studio president said, "Even Neo Mt. Fuji itself knows that I'm not the murderer!"

Engarde:
Huh? Me?

If that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!?

D-De Killer!?
Phoenix:
(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)
Engarde:
... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Engarde:
I'll let you represent me in court.
Pearl:
W-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)
Engarde:
Go ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...
Talk
Matt Engarde
Engarde:
Man, I thank my lucky stars that people know my name.
Phoenix:
Well, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight.
Pearl:
I didn't know who he is... Does that mean I'm not a good citizen...?
Engarde:
Ah, it's really great to be the Nickel Samurai. Dude, lately, I just keep on getting more and more popular.
Phoenix:
(True enough... "The Nickel Samurai" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...)
Engarde:
Do you know my motto? "Refreshing like a spring breeze." That's what I am.
Pearl:
A spring breeze...
Engarde:
That's why this kind of scandal is disastrous, dude. I mean, even if I get out of here tomorrow, it's still gonna look bad.
Phoenix:
(Everyone loves a good scandal...)
What happened
Phoenix:
Can you tell me about your activities last night?
Engarde:
After I got the award, I took a break and went back to my room. I had that post-ceremony stage show to do. So I was in my Nickel Samurai costume.
Phoenix:
And you were alone the entire time?
Engarde:
My manager was running around being busy, so yeah.
Phoenix:
Because of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show?
Engarde:
I told you, dude. I have no idea about any press conference, alright?
Phoenix:
(That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...)
Engarde:
Anyway, when I was leaving my room, that's when I noticed it was kinda noisy...
Phoenix:
Mr. Corrida was already dead at that time...?
Engarde:
Yeah, that's what I gathered anyway from my manager.
Phoenix:
(With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.)
Engarde:
And that's when the detective in the green coat showed up. He searched me... And then, out of the blue, the dude arrested me.
The victim (appears after Matt Engarde)
Phoenix:
About you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of...
Engarde:
That's got nothing to do with anything, dude. Man, with that face of his, you can't even tell he's the same age as me. And he wanted to try making a "Jammin' Ninja" movie, even though we all know it'd fail.
Phoenix:
The Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right?
Engarde:
Yeah. I took the Grand Prix by storm. So why would I, the winner, have any reason to kill the guy anyway? Dude, you'd think it'd be the other way around, you know?
The charge of murder (appears after What happened)
Phoenix:
Um... Do you know why you were arrested?
Engarde:
I guess maybe my full body search went badly.
Phoenix:
Did they find something on you?
Engarde:
They found a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.
Phoenix:
A button...?
Engarde:
I don't get it either. It was caught in the pleats of my samurai pants, or "hakama".
Pearl:
Aaah!
Engarde:
Dude, I really think someone planted it there though. I'm serious.
Phoenix:
(I wonder if that's what really happened...?)
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Phoenix:
... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)
Pearl:
Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Yeah?
Pearl:
Let's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...
Phoenix:
W-We can do that...?
Pearl:
Yes. If you use this...
Phoenix:
(Maya's Magatama!)
Pearl:
He won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.
Phoenix:
(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.
Engarde:
What is it, dude?
Phoenix:
Did you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?
Engarde:
...
Phoenix:
Please put the phone away and answer this question yourself.
Engarde:
Alright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?
Phoenix:
...
Pearl:
Well, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Nothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.
Pearl:
Which means... I think it is alright to trust him.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)
Engarde:
Um... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.
To be continued.
March 21, 11:34 AMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Phoenix:
Well, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...
Pearl:
So! So now what should we do!?
Phoenix:
Well, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.
Pearl:
OK! Then let's start looking!
Examine
Window
Phoenix:
There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...?
Plant
Pearl:
Oh! I'll water it!
Phoenix:
Ah, it's OK... I already did that...
Pearl:
...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?
Phoenix:
(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)
Poster
Pearl:
This is the Nickel Samurai... right?
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, that's right.
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her "Nickel Samurai", alright!?
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.
Pearl:
Oh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...
Phoenix:
I-It's OK, Pearls. Really.
Desk
Phoenix:
My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...
Pearl:
Oh! I cleaned it up some more for you last night! ...Because I couldn't sleep...
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
Since there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent.
Pearl:
I really feel much better knowing that. Ever since last night, I was so worried that I kept wondering... "What if he is the real killer...? What then...?"
Any ideas
Phoenix:
Hey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls.
Pearl:
OK, what is it?
Phoenix:
Why are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go--
Pearl:
Huh!? Wh-What do you mean!? B-But I thought... I thought you and Mystic Maya were... I-I've been mistaken all this time!? No way...!
Phoenix:
(Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...)
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! Stop it! Don't hide your true feelings from me!
Phoenix:
(Ow! She slapped me!!)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Pearl:
That's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure, isn't it?
Phoenix:
I guess?
Pearl:
I feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama...

Maya Fey profile
Pearl:
Oh, Mystic Maya... I wonder if you're alright...
Phoenix:
I'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me.
Pearl:
If there's anything I can do, please tell me, OK!?
Pearl Fey profile
Pearl:
To tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me.
Phoenix:
I think your hair now suits you perfectly.
Pearl:

Dick Gumshoe profile
Pearl:
I'm sure that Mr. Detective would be our ally if we asked!
Phoenix:
Yeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit "off", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.)
Will Powers profile
Pearl:
He's a really kind and nice old man, isn't he?
Phoenix:
(Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by "old man"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...?
Pearl:
What about you, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
(On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...)
Anything else
Pearl:
Um, there are still so many things in this world that I don't understand yet. ...Honestly, I still don't have enough training.
Phoenix:
Ah, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself...

I'm sorry. I'm really sorry!

Dude, like I told you, I don't know anything about that press conference. I leave that kind of stuff to my manager.
Phoenix:

Radio Transceiver
Engarde:
So, why are you carrying around that transceiver...?
Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about it.
Engarde:
And why do you do everything it tells you to do? You know, the messages it sends you, dude.
Phoenix:
(On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret.
Engarde:
OK, whatever, dude.
Juan Corrida profile
Engarde:
Look, dude, I didn't kill him. I mean, the Nickel Samurai kicked the Jammin' Ninja's butt, right? So it's not like I felt threatened by the likes of him.

Being rivals sounds like a sad way to relate to another person...

Oldbag:
Hey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...
Pearl:
Good morning.
Oldbag:
Hold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?
Phoenix:
U-Uh... Um...
Oldbag:
I heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another "Steel Samurai" doing the most evil of deeds.
Phoenix:
Um, you know... That's not entirely...
Oldbag:
I'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the "Queen Reaper". I swear that's what they dubbed me! "Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes," they would taunt.
Phoenix:
Um... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...
Oldbag:
Hmph! Don't push me, boy!
Pearl:
Um... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...
Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?
Oldbag:
Don't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!

Stage
Phoenix:
It's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...
Pearl:
...Even Mr. Engarde himself didn't seem to know, huh?
Phoenix:
(How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?)
Talk
The victim
Oldbag:
My dear Hammer died a year ago in that dreadful murder. And only recently did I finally find a star that makes this heart go *badump* again.
Phoenix:
...I don't know what to say...
Oldbag:
I ask you, why does every star I cheer for always ends up kicking the bucket?
Phoenix:
Umm...
Oldbag:
I'd watch your words! No one's going to get away with saying anything bad about my Juan!
Phoenix:
But I haven't said anything...
Oldbag:
Well, I don't believe a word that woman says anyway!
Phoenix:
Huh? What woman?
Oldbag:
That irritating, backwater girl with the afro and the horrible country accent. I mean, what is that manner of speaking supposed to be? And why does she never stop? Honestly, women these days. They don't know the meaning of the word "modesty". When I was a young maiden, I was so beautiful even the flowers of the field blushed. But despite this, I pressed flowers, or read the stars, or wrote beautiful love poems or
Phoenix:
...Pearls? Are you thirsty?
Pearl:
Um, a little.
Phoenix:
OK. I'll go get you some juice or something.
Pearl:
Th-Thank you very much.
Oldbag:
Hey! Are you paying attention!? Young'uns today!
Phoenix:
(So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...)
What happened
Phoenix:
I want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder...
Oldbag:
Ah, I don't know anything about that. I was here getting ready.
Phoenix:
Getting ready? For what...?
Oldbag:
The show, of course! ...Well, and the press conference afterwards.
Phoenix:
(Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.)
Oldbag:
Anyway, I don't know anything about the murder.
Phoenix:
Ah, I see...
Oldbag:
... But.
Phoenix:
?
Oldbag:
But if you're talking about what I saw, that's different. I saw it very clearly!
Pearl:
What!?
Oldbag:
I saw the most important moment of the night!
What you witnessed (appears after What happened)
Phoenix:
Th-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!?
Oldbag:
Oh, so now you treat me with respect, you disrespectful child. When you speak to your elders, you should always be polite. Really, kids today.
Phoenix:
Please tell me! What did you see!?
4 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Oldbag:
The murder last night was gruesome, wasn't it? But then, what murder isn't?

Phoenix:
...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.

There's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together...

That is such a beautiful sight.
Phoenix:
The chandelier?
Pearl:
Yes. But I can't believe it... I can't believe that such a terrible murder happened under such beautiful lights... It's shocking.
Stage
Phoenix:
The awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous.

You just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.

Wh-Wh-What!?
Lotta:
Arrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty!
Phoenix:
Wh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright?
Lotta:
Looked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!
Pearl:
Um, what are you looking for...?
Lotta:
My CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!!
Phoenix:
Y-Your camera...?

I can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...?
Lotta:
I didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!

(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)
Flowers on left
Phoenix:
Compared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...
Lotta:
Yeah, that's what I thought too, so I was a nice enough gal to lend a helpin' hand! ...Secretly, of course.
Phoenix:
(I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...)
Door on left
Phoenix:
There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, "Juan Corrida's Room".
Lotta:
So that's the scene of the murder, I reckon. I thought somethin' had gone on that night, but I didn't never think it was murder.
Door on right
Phoenix:
There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, "Matt Engarde's Room".
Pearl:
So Mr. Engarde was here during his break, right?
Phoenix:
That's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.)
Talk
Camera
Phoenix:
So you lost your camera...?
Lotta:
It ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!
Pearl:
Huh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?
Lotta:
I had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that!
Pearl:
When did you lose your camera?
Lotta:
Last night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie!
Phoenix:
Lotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours?
Lotta:
I don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.
Phoenix:

Lotta's Camera added to the Court Record.
What happened
Phoenix:
Lotta, please tell me what you know about what happened at the time of the murder.
Lotta:
Well, from before the ceremony last night, I was hangin' around here in this area. Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested.
Phoenix:
What were you doing here...?
Lotta:
You sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had!
Phoenix:
A big scoop...?
Lotta:
I told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot!
Phoenix:
(I wonder what "scoop" she was after this time...?)
Lotta:
Although, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time...
Big scoop (appears after Camera and What happened)
Phoenix:
Lotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop?
Lotta:
Well... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof?
Phoenix:
What kind of story was it that you would hang around here...?

You're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.

Um... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?

You were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.
Pearl:
Wow...

It's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?

Looks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...?
Plate on right
Phoenix:
There's a giant bone sitting on the plate.
Pearl:
I... I don't really like meat...
Phoenix:
(...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...)
Talk
Night of the murder
Andrews:
I assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, that is correct.
Andrews:
Then I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add.
Phoenix:
"Dinner"? What did you eat?
Andrews:
I told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me.
Phoenix:
(...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...)
Andrews:
When the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall.
Phoenix:
And after the show ended, you came back to this room...?
Andrews:
No, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby.
Phoenix:
Oh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...)
Andrews:
When it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida...
Phoenix:
And that's when you found his body, isn't it?
Andrews:
...
Pearl:
You really held strong through everything...
Phoenix:
(Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...)
Relation to Engarde
Phoenix:
Um, so... About you and...
Andrews:
Stop right there. Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.
Phoenix:
S-Sorry...
Andrews:
I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Why did she have to go and say something like that...?)
Pearl:
Mr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright?
Andrews:
I already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager.
Phoenix:
His manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one?
Andrews:
No, he did not.
Phoenix:
He didn't?
Andrews:
Global Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars.
Phoenix:
I see...
Andrews:
This industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly.
Pearl:
You're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...!
Phoenix:
Pearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright?
Pearl:
Nngh...
Motive for murder (after presenting Juan Corrida profile)
Phoenix:
Do you have any ideas?
Andrews:
As to...?
Phoenix:
As to why Mr. Corrida was murdered?
Andrews:
Why would you ask me about such a thing...?
Phoenix:
I'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas?
4 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
M-Ms. Andrews...?
Andrews:
Sorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation.
Pearl:
Is it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Yes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately.
Motive for murder (after Psyche-Locks appear)
Phoenix:
You know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered...
4 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Andrews:
Why are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart.
Phoenix:
(No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.)
Pearl:
If you don't remove her locks...
Phoenix:
(Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...)
Present
Press Conference Ticket
Phoenix:
You were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right?
Andrews:
Yes, that's right.
Pearl:
But Mr. Engarde said he "didn't know" about it.
Andrews:
... Is that what he said...?
Pearl:
Huh...?
Andrews:
Actually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked.
Pearl:
Oh... I see.
Phoenix:
(I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.)
Will Powers profile
Andrews:
That's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be.
Phoenix:
(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)
Andrews:
...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...)
Pearl:
I wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews...
Juan Corrida profile
Phoenix:
Did you know the victim, Mr. Corrida?
Andrews:
Yes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all.
Pearl:
Did you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai?
Andrews:
Honestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things. ... If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.
Phoenix:
! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!)
Matt Engarde profile
Andrews:
I asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...)
Pearl:
He's always saying, "my manager," right Mr. Nick?
Andrews:
...
Adrian Andrews profile
Andrews:
I hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why.
Phoenix:
S-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...)
Anything else
Phoenix:
Um, I'd like to ask you about this...
Andrews:
I told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me.
Phoenix:

March 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room
Pearl:
Mr. Nick... Where are we...?
Phoenix:
We're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls.
Pearl:
Mr. Corrida...?
Phoenix:
The victim... Which makes this the crime scene too.
Gumshoe:
Oh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?
Phoenix:
Not yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.
Gumshoe:
Umm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?
Phoenix:
(I just want Maya to be alright...)
Pearl:
...
Gumshoe:
We don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.
Phoenix:
Can you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?
Gumshoe:
Just this once... "Special circumstances" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.
Phoenix:
Thank you.
Gumshoe:
Oh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.
Pearl:
Wow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!
Gumshoe:
Ha ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! I got a map!
Phoenix:
That's great, Pearls!
Pearl:
... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says...

Refrigerator
Phoenix:
There are all sorts of things in this refrigerator...
Pearl:
The carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty...
Phoenix:
Empty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut.
Pearl:
...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too!
Phoenix:
Maybe red was his favorite color...?
Bears
Pearl:
Wow, there are a lot of bears!
Phoenix:
(Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?)
Pearl:
There's even a few in the trash can...
Phoenix:
Yeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears.
Pearl:
Poor teddies...
It's hard to "bear" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
Phoenix:
... (I don't think I want to "bear" with the trauma the last case caused me...)
Pearl:
What's wrong, Mr. Nick?
Desk
Pearl:
Hmph! It's so messy here!
Phoenix:
(Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...)
Pearl:
There are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please?
Phoenix:
OK. That over there is a "watch". You wear it on your wrist.
Pearl:
... I know what a watch is...
Phoenix:
(Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...)
Blue suitcase
Phoenix:
It's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator...
Pearl:
Do all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida?
Examine (right side)
Table on right
Phoenix:
It looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night.
Pearl:
This bottle... It's tomato juice.
Phoenix:
(We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...)
Bedroom
Pearl:
So that's a bed, right?
Phoenix:
Yup. It's big, but it's a bed.
Pearl:
Aaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!
Phoenix:
(Big beds must be a rarity for her...)
Floor near guitar case
Phoenix:
Bottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.
Pearl:
What's this glass fragment from...?
Phoenix:
A flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are.
Pearl:
You don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick?
Guitar case
Phoenix:
This is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.
Pearl:
That's strange. The guitar is not here...
Phoenix:
Maybe he forgot to bring it to the show?
Pearl:
But Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...
Phoenix:
(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on top of the lid...
Pearl:
Yeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?
Guitar Case added to the Court Record.
Wine glass
Phoenix:
It's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.
Pearl:
Ewww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.
Phoenix:
There's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.
Pearl:
But doesn't it seem weird?
Phoenix:
...What seems weird?
Pearl:
I mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.
Phoenix:
... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)
Pearl:
Why is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?
Wine Glass added to the Court Record.
Talk
Cause of death
Phoenix:
Do you know what was the cause of death?
Gumshoe:
Well, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.
Phoenix:
The scene of the crime...?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Here's a picture.
Phoenix:
There's a knife in his chest.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
(So he was stabbed to death...)
Gumshoe:
They're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.
Phoenix:
There were fingerprints on the knife?
Gumshoe:
Yup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.
Phoenix:
(That's bad... Real bad...)
Crime Photo added to the Court Record.
Reason for arrest
Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?
Gumshoe:
Because we had evidence on him.
Pearl:
Evidence...?
Gumshoe:
It looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight.
Phoenix:
Yeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere.
Gumshoe:
Well, yeah. During the fight, his button came off...
Phoenix:
(Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his "hakama"...)
Gumshoe:
But that's not all...
Phoenix:
What!?
Gumshoe:
There was a witness, pal.
Phoenix:
A witness!? Wh-Who is it!?
Gumshoe:
That lady... Ms. Oldbag.
Phoenix:
(Please... Anyone but her!)
Gumshoe:
The prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.
Phoenix:
Something that was a little off...? As in...?
Gumshoe:
As in, that's for you to figure out, pal!
Pearl:
Alright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick!
Present
Radio Transceiver
Gumshoe:
That's your "present" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that...
Pearl:
Yeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is!
Phoenix:
(It uses radio waves, huh?)
Gumshoe:
I got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal!
Guitar Case
Phoenix:
What can you tell me about this guitar case?
Gumshoe:
Oh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item.
Phoenix:
The guitar case?
Gumshoe:
No, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course!
Pearl:
But... The guitar is missing.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show.
Phoenix:
(It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...)
Wine Glass
Phoenix:
So about this wine glass...
Gumshoe:
Ah, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched.
Phoenix:
You noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...?
Gumshoe:
No, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first.
Phoenix:
Yeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.
Phoenix:
You can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash.
Crime Photo
Gumshoe:
You look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, "I can't believe this is the scene of a murder."
Phoenix:

Gumshoe:
If you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK?

Phoenix:
Huh? Really? Then who's in first...?
Gumshoe:
Ms. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race.
Phoenix:
O-Oh...

I thought she was an alien from outer space.
Phoenix:
Yeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet.
Gumshoe:
Nah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal.
Phoenix:
... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean...
Adrian Andrews profile
Gumshoe:
She's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who "gets things done".
Phoenix:
Yeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together.
Gumshoe:
Compared to her, you can easily tell I'm a "can't do anything right" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up.
Phoenix:
(I feel sort of bad for him...)
Anything else
Phoenix:
What do you know about this?
Gumshoe:
Um... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast...

Gumshoe:
It's Ms. von Karma...
Pearl:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...)
Gumshoe:
S-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww!
von Karma:
At last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:
(*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?)
von Karma:
So you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you!
Phoenix:
(Owww!)
von Karma:
Hey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat!
Gumshoe:
Ah!

I didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful...

Uwaah!
von Karma:

Gumshoe:
Yeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!
von Karma:
...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment.
Phoenix:

von Karma:
Mr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine!
Phoenix:
... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...?
von Karma:
Wh-What...!?
Phoenix:

von Karma:
... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.
Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir!
von Karma:
This isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor!
Phoenix:
(Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!? What is this...?)
Gumshoe:
...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you...

Mr. Nick, what's this piece of paper...?
Phoenix:
It's called an "autograph".
Pearl:
Auto-graff?
Phoenix:
It's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph.
Pearl:
I can't read it at all. To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this.
Phoenix:
Ah, it's a special way of writing called "cursive".
Phoenix:
Look here. See how it says, "To my dearest Wendy" in more normal letters here?
Pearl:
Th-This sloppy, unreadable writing! It's crazy and cruel to give this to someone!

The Nickel Samurai
Phoenix:
Can you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show?
Powers:
OK. "The Nickel Samurai" is an action hero program aimed towards kids. It's the sequel to "The Steel Samurai".
Phoenix:
I see...
Powers:
This time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love "Y" in Neo Olde Tokyo!
Phoenix:
I see... ... W-Wait... A love what...?
Powers:
A love "Y". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time.
Phoenix:
Oh... I guess the "Y" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl?
Powers:
Anyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader!
Phoenix:
Sounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three.
Powers:
Y-Yeah... Strange thing is, this sort of forbidden love story is really big with the office ladies.
Pearl:
Um...
Powers:
Yes, Pearl?
Pearl:
Wh-What happens next!? I want to know! Ms. Sayo... Does Ms. Sayo fall in love? She does, doesn't she?
Powers:
Every Sunday at 8 AM.
Pearl:
I'm going to stop watching "Kids' Masterpiece Theatre" starting this week!
Phoenix:
(I can't believe she's really considering it!)
Jammin' Ninja
Phoenix:
So what's the "Jammin' Ninja" TV show like?
Powers:
It started from a remake of an old movie, to tell you the truth. The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star.
Phoenix:
...Uh, what?
Powers:
He was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm.
Phoenix:
A... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!?
Powers:
And then, the final fight in front of his beloved Princess Misola! "Jammin' versus the Muromachi Five!" Suddenly! Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3!
Phoenix:
Aww, that's too bad for him...
Powers:
Y-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like.
Pearl:
Um...
Powers:
Yes, Pearl?
Pearl:
Wh-What happens next!? I want to know!
Pearl:
Jammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!?
Powers:
Every Sunday at 8 AM.
Pearl:
Umm... Which show should I watch...? Hmm...
Phoenix:

The gossip on Adrian (after presenting Adrian Andrews profile)
Phoenix:
Would you mind telling me about this "gossip"?
Powers:
Ah, so you're interested in it too! I figured you would be!
Phoenix:
Yeah.

I have such a weakness for celebrity gossip too.
Phoenix:
O-Oh really... You too, huh...?
Powers:
Yeah. So take a look at this!
Phoenix:

Powers:
"...to the mysterious, yet beautiful manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!" ...Y-You see now, don't you?
Phoenix:
What...?
Powers:
You can stop pretending to be in the dark, Mr. Wright! Juan Corrida didn't have a manager of his own. Which means if we're talking about a certain manager with the initials A. A....
Phoenix:
... Adrian Andrews...?
Powers:
Y-Yes, exactly! This is big news!!
Phoenix:
(But... It seems kind of odd. That woman, Ms. Andrews... Together with the biggest rival of her client...?)
Powers:
Ah, it's that wonderful thing that can only happen between two people...
Pearl:
Mr. Powers looks so happy.

And... And it even says, "To my dearest Wendy" on it! Th-That's me, right!? Right!?
Phoenix:
Um...
Oldbag:
My name is Wendy Oldbag, so that "Wendy" has to be me, right!?
Phoenix:
(Well, it may say "Wendy"... But somehow, I don't think Juan had THIS "Wendy" in mind when he signed it...)
Oldbag:
Oh, please, give it to me! Let me have it! Please!

Uh, un. I can't let you have it, just like that.

What you witnessed

I feel bad for you now.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Oldbag:
I tell you, I saw him that night. I saw him coming out of Juan's room.
Phoenix:
You're kidding!
Pearl:
Oh no!
Oldbag:
It was about ten minutes before Juan's body was discovered. It was just a coincidence. I was on my way to the toilet, minding my own business.
Phoenix:
And...? Did you tell that to the police?
Oldbag:
Well, of course! I thought I could get a gift certificate or two out of it, maybe more.
Pearl:
Gift certificate...?
Oldbag:
I've been recruited again for that part at the trial. You know, the trial tomorrow? This time, you're gonna get it! I'm gonna work hard to get your client pronounced guilty!
Pearl:
But Mr. Engarde hasn't done anything bad...
Oldbag:
I don't care about details like that! I know he did my dear poor Juan in! I just do! That yellow-bellied chicken!
Pearl:
A yellow-bellied chicken...? I wonder what that would look like...
Oldbag:
I trust my senses. I know when someone did something bad, and I say he did it!

Pearl:
Mr. Nick... What do "viles" and "wile temptress" mean...?
Phoenix:
Ack! Um, how about we just listen to what Ms. Oldbag has to say for now, OK Pearls? So, Ms. Oldbag. Who is this "woman" you're talking about...?
Oldbag:
...Adrian Andrews, of course! Who else!? That guy, he shoved the girl onto Juan on purpose!
Phoenix:
His own manager? But why...?
Oldbag:
I thought lawyers were smart! It was to create a scandal to make Juan lose face! That girl drove Juan into a scandal that dragged his reputation through the mud!
Phoenix:
(Sounds like a pretty standard definition of a scandal to me...) Why do you know about that anyway, Ms. Oldbag?
Oldbag:
I'm one of Juan's biggest fans! I'm always out there gathering information! There's nothing I don't know!
Phoenix:
And do you have proof that Mr. Engarde did what you say he did...?
Oldbag:
Next week's issue of a certain magazine says so!
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
You can't win on your own at the trial tomorrow.
Phoenix:
(What is that supposed to mean...?)
Edgeworth:
I have something definitive that you lack. And that's the definition of teamwork. It's the power to find the truth.
Phoenix:
"The truth"...?
Edgeworth:
In order to understand this case, you have to understand a certain "truth". ...Well, if you ever feel the need for my assistance, it is available to you. I'm not in charge of this case, so I can be a bit more generous with information.
Phoenix:
(Just what is going on inside his head...?)
"Proof of Von Karma blood"
Edgeworth:
A lot of things may have happened, however Manfred von Karma was still my mentor. And a "perfect win record" is proof of a Von Karma.
Phoenix:
...One year ago, you could not establish guilt in a few cases... Are those losses the reason you suddenly disappeared from the Prosecutor's Office? Did you leave because you had lost your "perfect win record"...?
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
To think your motivation for prosecuting trials was so selfish... It'd been better for everyone if you never came back from the dead, Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
... I see. Then let me ask you something. Why do YOU stand in the courtroom? What is your reason?
Why stand in court? (appears after "Proof of Von Karma blood")
Phoenix:
Well, if it was Franziska, she would almost definitely say,
von Karma:
"I will defeat you this time!" the instant she saw me.
Phoenix:
But... The courtroom is not a personal battlefield for prosecutors and lawyers. I stand in the courtroom to defend my client. ...To save their lives.
Edgeworth:
To save your client, you say?
Phoenix:
Those who think only of their own ego-driven goals... Those kind of prosecutors are reprehensible to me. Even if you're a "prodigy"... Or someone like you, Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
... It looks like there is still a lot you have yet to learn.
Phoenix:
"A lot I have yet to learn"? Me...?
Edgeworth:
...Hmph. Well, that's enough for now. The time when you will see is coming soon enough...
Missing suicide note (after presenting Celeste Inpax profile)
Edgeworth:
Ms. Inpax's death was most certainly a suicide. Of that there is no mistake. However, we could not find her suicide note. That's when the police began to suspect that someone had hidden it.
Phoenix:
The suicide note? But how do you know Ms. Inpax had even written such a note?
Edgeworth:
There was no solid evidence, however... We did find traces of ink on her right index finger. Which makes the likelihood of a suicide note very high.
Phoenix:
But who would hide such a thing...?
Edgeworth:
The police think it was Mr. Juan Corrida himself.
Phoenix:
Th-The victim...?
Edgeworth:
He was the one who found her body. Which makes him the only person who had a chance to hide her suicide note.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Corrida hid his own manager's suicide note...? But why...?)
Edgeworth:
As long as her note is missing, any speculation beyond this is meaningless... For now, I think you should look this over. This is the suicide report... Part one anyway...
Phoenix:
(Part one...?)
Suicide Report added to the Court Record.
"Co-dependency" (after presenting Suicide Report)
Phoenix:
So, how are "Adrian Andrews" and "co-dependency" related?
Edgeworth:
Adrian Andrews' attempt at suicide... was a few days after the death of Celeste Inpax.
Phoenix:
And...?
Edgeworth:
And why did Adrian Andrews think about committing suicide...? Quite possibly because she had "lost her will to live."
Phoenix:
Lost her will...? But why would she...?
Edgeworth:
Her pillar of strength, her mentor Celeste Inpax, was gone forever. That's why.
Phoenix:
Wh-Why would that...?
Pearl:
Is this what they call, "following someone to the grave"...?
Edgeworth:
After her attempted suicide, Adrian Andrews started attending counseling sessions. She is a person who looks for someone she can trust unconditionally. And once she finds that someone, she blindly follows them. Without someone to guide her, she feels uneasy and can't carry herself through life.
Phoenix:
...! And that's... That's her "co-dependency"...?
Edgeworth:
When Celeste Inpax suddenly committed suicide, the world before her turned pitch dark... That's according to Adrian Andrews herself.
Phoenix:
Then... That means her super-confident attitude...
Edgeworth:
It's all a façade. She's only copying her mentor's behavior to hold herself together.
Phoenix:
(How terrible...)
Attempted Suicide Report added to the Court Record.

Suicide Report
Edgeworth:
I don't like to look through reports. I like suicide reports even less. Worst of all are the reports that have multiple parts like that one. That has two.

Phoenix:
(The second part of the report is about an attempted suicide...) The attempter's name...! It's "Adrian Andrews"!
Pearl:
M-Ms. Andrews...? Um, what did she do?
Phoenix:
She... She tried to kill herself...? She doesn't seem like the kind of person to try and kill herself...
Edgeworth:
You think she's a strong career woman? That is just her image. Adrian Andrews... She has a certain secret she's always trying to hide.
Pearl:
A secret...?
Edgeworth:
...Her "co-dependency". That's the key word.
Phoenix:

Attempted Suicide Report
Edgeworth:
Appearances can be deceiving. It's such a cliché saying... But it's cliché because it's true.

Phoenix:
D-Do you really think so?
Edgeworth:
She was Adrian Andrews' mentor a long time ago, but suddenly, she was called away by a production, and became Juan Corrida's manager. And then, a few months later... Celeste Inpax died.
Phoenix:
B-But her death was a suicide, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. But there is still one riddle left unsolved...
Phoenix:
A riddle...?
Edgeworth:
Her suicide note. It went missing. No one could find it.
Phoenix:
(A suicide note that just vanished, huh...)
Any other evidence
Edgeworth:
I have no interest in talking about useless evidence. Put a little more thought into what you show me... Phoenix Wright.
Phoenix:
(Still as stuck up as ever...)
Any other profile
Edgeworth:
We are looking into leads, but we can only look into a few key players with our limited resources. There's no reason for us to waste our energy investigating this person.
Phoenix:
(Why don't you just tell it to me straight and say, "I don't have any info"?)

Th-That's you, Ms. von Karma! You're the one doing the following!
Phoenix:

You're always following after that Mr. Detective with the little beard!
von Karma:
...Me? Following after Scruffy...? Don't make me laugh. I'll show you something interesting... little girl.

von Karma:
An electromagnetic receiver. I planted a tracking device on that detective. And with this, I know that fool's every move.
Phoenix:
(So that noise we heard was this receiver... I feel really sorry for poor Detective Gumshoe now...)

Now then... Let's stop wasting time. Adrian Andrews!

-- Motive for Murder --
Phoenix:
Why was Juan Corrida murdered? If you ask me, I think you know the reason he was killed.
Andrews:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
Why are you hiding things? Don't you realize you're putting Mr. Engarde's life in danger by your actions?
Andrews:
... Why do you ask questions for which I have no answer? The truth is, I was not that close to Mr. Corrida.
Phoenix:
You were not that close...?
Andrews:
That's right. I've never been good at being intimate with another person.
Phoenix:
You are not good at being intimate with another person? Somehow, I highly doubt that.

Leads to:

Andrews:
I'm very bad at connecting with people. They're so depressing for the most part.
Phoenix:
Um...
Andrews:
But I especially dislike feeble-minded individuals.
Phoenix:
Yes, well...
Andrews:
That's why I don't think I could ever be intimate with you.
Phoenix:
(So... I guess she's saying I'm both depressing and stupid...?) But I am certain you were very close with the victim.
Andrews:
Say that all you like, but you still don't have any proof.
Leads to:
"You are not good at being intimate with another person? Somehow, I highly doubt that."
Phoenix:
You and Mr. Corrida had an intimate relationship, did you not...?
Andrews:
... A silly third-rate tabloid article. If you even had half your wits about you, you wouldn't believe such rubbish.
Phoenix:
Well, it seems quite a few people bought into this story.
Andrews:
Hmph. As to be expected in a world filled with crooks and liars.
Phoenix:
(...Note to self: Stay on her good side.)
Andrews:
In any case, I despise interpersonal relationships like that.
Phoenix:
I see... However... What if there was a need for you to get close to someone...?
Andrews:
Me? Need to get close to Mr. Corrida? As if there was ever such a need.
Phoenix:
Didn't you get close to Mr. Corrida for this person's sake...?

Andrews:
It's called a job. I am in charge of Mr. Engarde the star, not Matt Engarde the man.
Phoenix:
O-Oh.
Andrews:
And you are not my client.
Phoenix:
(Is this my subtle hint to "go home"...?) But... I know you must have had a need to get close to the victim.

1 LOCK BROKEN
Phoenix:
Ms. Inpax... She committed suicide, didn't she?
Andrews:
...
Phoenix:
But it looks like no one knows why. Right before her death, she was Juan Corrida's manager. So, I believe you got close to Mr. Corrida so you could find out more about her suicide.
Andrews:
...Y-You have a great imagination. You may have a future yet as a slimy muckraker for a putrid third-rate tabloid!
Phoenix:
M-Ms. Andrews...?
Andrews:
Th-There was no mystery surrounding her death. None. It would be pointless for me to force myself into a relationship for nothing!
Phoenix:
(Is that really true...? Was there really no mystery at all?) I don't believe you were completely at ease with the way her suicide was resolved!

Leads back to:
"Th-There was no mystery surrounding her death. None."
Phoenix:
...Ms. Inpax's suicide note was never found, was it?
Andrews:
...!
Phoenix:
It looks like the police were under the suspicion that someone had hidden it. Like maybe the person who discovered her body, Mr. Corrida.
Andrews:
J... Juan?
Phoenix:
And, Ms. Andrews, I believe you thought the same thing! That is why you became intimate with Mr. Corrida!

Andrews:
It's true that Celeste was my mentor, however, allow me to say this again: It had nothing to do with me! I didn't even know that her suicide note was never found! I'm a person who doesn't care about what goes on in the lives of others!
Phoenix:
(That's the impression you like to give, however...) I don't think that's who you really are.
Andrews:
What?
Phoenix:
I have evidence that says otherwise. This is proof that Celeste Inpax was someone very special to you...

Phoenix:
"Pity"...?
Andrews:
Although, thanks to your little spectacle, I feel much better about myself.

Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews... You... You went through it too, didn't you?
Andrews:
Went through what?
Phoenix:
A suicide.
Andrews:
...!
Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews, you look and act like a very strong woman who has it all together. You don't ask for anyone's help and you live by yourself.
Andrews:
Y-Yes. I've been very independent ever since I can remember...
Phoenix:
However, that is all just a lie. A façade.
Andrews:
...
Phoenix:
You've always searched out people on whom you can depend on.
Andrews:
Th-That's...!
Phoenix:
You were dependent on Ms. Inpax, weren't you? Which is why... When she passed away, you lost everything you had.
Andrews:
S-Stop!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Andrews:
... When Celeste passed away so suddenly like that... I died a death of my own. But... No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop thinking about what had become of her note.
Phoenix:
You must have heard about the police report... The one that said the police suspected Mr. Corrida of hiding Ms. Inpax's note... You heard about it, and thought to recover it from him by getting close, am I right?
Andrews:
...
Phoenix:
If that's the case, then everything changes.
Andrews:
Wh-What do you mean?
Phoenix:
What topic did we start this conversation on again?
Andrews:
It was "why was the victim killed"...
Phoenix:
Exactly. Somehow, Ms. Andrews... It seems that you have become the one most likely to want Mr. Corrida dead...
Andrews:
M-Me...?
Phoenix:
Ms. Inpax was everything to you. ...And then she died. And you would do anything to find out why she killed herself. ...Even commit murder.

Motive for murder
Leads to:
"It's true. I am a woman who can only live in insecurity."
Andrews:
It's true. I am a woman who can only live in insecurity. I'm physically small, and I don't really have a lot of self-confidence. I've pushed against all that, though... I've tried to live strongly. I never wanted anyone to find out the truth...
Pearl:
Ms. Andrews...
Andrews:
This one thing... It's the one thing I wanted to take with me to the grave... It was my secret. Mine and mine alone.
Phoenix:
I... I'm sorry.
Andrews:
You probably think I'm a worthless human being right now, don't you?
Phoenix:
Please, Ms. Andrews. All I want to know is the truth.
Andrews:
After Celeste passed away, I heard that someone had hidden her suicide note... And that someone was Juan Corrida. Celeste... Without her... Without her, I became scared. Everything... Everyone seemed like they were out to get me.
Phoenix:
So you got close to Mr. Corrida to recover her suicide note, correct?
Andrews:
... Looks like that tabloid reported the truth after all. Ironic, isn't it?
Phoenix:
Well, like they say, where there's smoke, there's fire.
Andrews:
And if they purposely add fuel to the fire, they keep the celebrity world burning.
Pearl:
...
Andrews:
But as for the suicide note? I didn't and wouldn't kill anyone for it. It just doesn't suit me, that's all.
Andrews:
... Well, that's enough for now. I still have work to do, so...
Phoenix:
I understand.
Andrews:
Oh, I have one small favor to ask. My... attempted suicide... I'd like for you to keep it a secret.
Pearl:
Ms. Andrews...
Andrews:
If... If people found out about my weakness... I... I would sooner choose to die than live.
Phoenix:
A-A-Alright! I understand! We'll keep it a secret! (Ms. Andrews... I guess she's the "always thinking" type... She never says anything carelessly, it seems...)
Andrews:
Thank you very much.
Pearl:
Mr. Nick... Can I ask you something...?
Phoenix:
What is it?
Pearl:
Ms. Andrews has been playing with that card in her hand since a little while back...
Phoenix:
(That card...? Yeah, I guess she has...) Ms. Andrews, what is that card you're holding...?
Andrews:
Huh? O-Oh, this? I don't quite know. It just suddenly appeared in my handbag...
Phoenix:
What is it? It looks like... A seashell?
Andrews:
That's what it looks like, doesn't it? I honestly don't remember owning this card... I wonder where I picked it up from...?
Phoenix:
(Her not remembering something clearly? Sounds like it would be a rare occurence.)
Andrews:
Well, I must be off. I leave Mr. Engarde in your "capable" hands.
