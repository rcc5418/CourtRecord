The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber
Ryunosuke:
(There's that old familiar feeling again... The crushing pressure of this historic courthouse.) ......... (Actually, no... it's a little different today. There's an even more menacing tension in the air.)
Susato:
There is a menacing tension in the air here today, isn't there? I suppose...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I think so. It can only be the result of the menacing appearance of the defendant.
Van Zieks:
A little more courtesy, if you please.
Susato:
Oh my! I, I do apologise!
Van Zieks:
However...you're certainly not mistaken that this trial is far from ordinary.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Van Zieks:
I'm not privy to the details. However... ...I understand that no jury has been selected.
Susato:
A trial without a jury?! Well, well that's just like... ...the trial of the Professor ten years ago!
Ryunosuke:
(A closed court...)
Sholmes:
Good morning, my dear fellows!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
Have you made note of my hair, Mr Naruhodo? An outright victory for science, you must agree!
Ryunosuke:
......... To be perfectly honest, so much happened yesterday that, well... ...I completely forgot about your little hair problem.
Sholmes:
Hah! What to one man is a 'little hair problem'... ...is to another a day of drinking dubious potion after dubious potion. You have no idea how my stomach ails me this morning!
Susato:
Oh dear! How awful for you.
Ryunosuke:
I'm afraid you only have yourself to blame, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
And good morning to you, Mr Reaper. I'm delighted to see you looking so full of vim.
Van Zieks:
And I you. I see London's celebrated great detective is as active as ever.
Sholmes:
Oh, you exaggerate, my dear fellow. Compared to my paltry engagements with a few trivial cases... ...the Reaper's overbearing presence is a far greater deterrent to the black roots of crime in our capital.
Van Zieks:
.........
Sholmes:
And whilst I may not agree with your methods... ...there is at least one point on which I would readily commend you.
Van Zieks:
What an honour. And that would be...?
Sholmes:
Your eye for a good lawyer, sir.
Van Zieks:
...!
Ryunosuke:
M-Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
After all... ...behind this lawyer there is a very great mind. My own.
Van Zieks:
What are you trying to say?
Sholmes:
I wish only to say that you should be prepared for quite a trial, Mr Reaper.
Van Zieks:
...!
???:
Sorry to barge in...
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Gina! (What's that on her arm? It's a mourning band, I suppose...)
Susato:
Father! Shouldn't you be at the symposium?
Mikotoba:
It's been postponed. So I have some free time. I decided to come along with the police inspector to see our country's up-and-coming student in action.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Mikotoba:
I shall be very interested to see the fruits of your studies over the past year.
Ryunosuke:
Well...it's an honour to have you here! (Let's hope there are some fruits to see...)
Gina:
......... 'Oddo...
Ryunosuke:
Oh! ...Yes, Gina?
Gina:
Why d'you agree to this, eh? Why d'you take 'im on?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Gina:
This, this Reaper bloke... Everyone says it was 'im wot... ...wot killed the boss.
Ryunosuke:
......... I'm sorry, Gina. But I just don't believe that.
Gina:
Well if it weren't 'im, who was it?!
Ryunosuke:
I don't know that...yet.
Gina:
I don't care who calls 'im wot. The Reaper's just a name. 'E's just a person at the end o' the day. An' if it turns out it was 'im wot killed the boss...then God 'elp 'im!
Van Zieks:
......... Fiery eyes indeed... Yes, the culprit deserves every ounce of your loathing.
Gina:
Eh?
Van Zieks:
At least that may be some solace to the deceased.
Gina:
......... P-Please, 'Oddo... ...get whoever did this. For the boss.
Susato:
Oh, Gina...
Gina:
I 'ate feelin' this useless, but there's nuffin' I can do. So you've gotta find who done this and make the wretch pay!
Bailiff:
Counsel for the Defence! And the defendant! Court will be in session shortly. Make your way into the courtroom at once, please!
Ryunosuke:
(Alright then, here we go...)
Susato:
It's time, Mr Naruhodo! Lord van Zieks!
One who lost his treasured brother to a mass murderer... One who lost his treasured father in a foreign court of law... And one who lost the man who helped her escape destitution... All that misfortune...all that pain...on course to collide headlong in this trial. It's time to shine a light on all these dark events. And whatever truth is revealed... ...we're going to have to look it straight in the eye.
2nd November, 9:20 a.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. We are here to conduct the fair and just trial of the defendant, Barok van Zieks. Counsels for the defence and prosecution, are you ready to begin?
Ryunosuke:
...The defence is ready, My Lord.
Kazuma:
The prosecution...is more than ready.
Susato:
Oh, Kazuma-sama...
Ryunosuke:
(I've been wishing to see you in court again for so long, it feels... But I never pictured it happening like this. I never thought I'd be facing you behind the prosecution's bench.)
Judge:
The so-called 'Reaper of the Bailey'... ...has been a scourge like no other, undermining Her Majesty's justice system. Today we must uncover the truth behind this scourge.
Ryunosuke:
(In other words... ...this trial is going to be a lot more far-reaching than Inspector Gregson's murder.)
Judge:
The truths revealed by these proceedings may have unpredictable repercussions through the judiciary. Accordingly, they are to be conducted as a closed trial, with no members of the public present. By Her Majesty's direct orders.
Ryunosuke:
How will that work, My Lord?
Judge:
The burden of all arbitration and adjudication falls on my shoulders. Therefore, as you will see... ...the jurors' bench shall remain vacant today.
Susato:
If no members of the public are present, might I ask who is currently occupying the gallery, My Lord?
Judge:
They are members of the judiciary, here to witness proceedings and ensure an equitable trial.
Ryunosuke:
Members of the judiciary...
Susato:
Oh my...this is a very unusual trial already.
Judge:
There is of course another, unprecedented aspect to these proceedings on which I must elaborate. The counsels for the prosecution and the defence are both aliens of Great Britain.
Kazuma:
......... I believe it takes an outsider to see the truth sometimes. And as I stand here in this courtroom now, I'm quite certain... ...this is the reason why I had to come to Britain.
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma...?
Judge:
Very well. Let us commence proceedings. Prosecutor Asogi...your opening statement, if you please.
Kazuma:
Certainly, My Lord. The incident took place on 1st November at just after five o'clock in the afternoon. The location was a building of flats on Fresno Street on the outskirts of the city. The victim's body was discovered there in an old single-room rental property.
Judge:
Yes, Inspector Tobias Gregson. A name known very well indeed to this court. Not least for his miraculous resolution of one of this country's grimmest cases ten years ago.
Susato:
The Professor case.
Ryunosuke:
How sure are you about the time of the incident?
Kazuma:
Several witnesses on the street outside heard the gunshot, and all have reported the same time.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, that's what Gina told us, too. There were a number of witnesses.)
Kazuma:
I have here a plan of the room. The victim was found curled up in one corner. It's believed that he was shot from the front at point-blank range and died instantly.
Judge:
Hm... How has the range been determined?
Kazuma:
There were scorch marks around the entry wound. Such marks are caused by the gunpowder used to fire the bullet. But powder hot enough to leave scorch marks is only ejected a few inches beyond the end of the barrel. In other words, it only happens when the target is at point-blank range.
Judge:
I see, yes. Thank you for the detailed explanation, Counsel.
The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.
Kazuma:
The murder weapon was found lying beside the victim.
Judge:
And have you managed to ascertain the owner of this firearm?
Kazuma:
No, My Lord. Not conclusively.
Susato:
Bravo, Kazuma-sama... ...for not trying to use the gun as evidence when its provenance can't be proven.
Kazuma:
Furthermore, My Lord... As I've explained, the revolver was fired at extremely close range. The bullet passed through the victim and struck the wall behind him. There is a candelabrum mounted on that wall... ...and the tip of one of the candles in it was found to have been blown off by the projectile.
Susato:
We noticed that too, didn't we?
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, that's right.)
Judge:
Thank you for the thorough report, Counsel. The setting of the crime is clear to me. You will submit the plan of the crime scene as evidence, please.
Kazuma:
As you wish, My Lord.
The crime scene floor plan has been entered into the Court Record.
Judge:
Is this Fresno Street room Inspector Gregson's private abode?
Kazuma:
No, My Lord. The room is rented to a Mr Hugh Boone. But there is precious little furniture inside, and it is generally in a poor state of repair.
Ryunosuke:
(So what on earth was Gregson even doing there?)
Susato:
Presumably he was investigating some case or other...
Kazuma:
When a policeman was informed of the gunshot from the witnesses and rushed to the scene... ...he found only the deceased inspector and the accused standing alongside holding the revolver. The attending officer arrested the accused on the spot.
Judge:
So...the details of the case are clear.
Kazuma:
In that case, the prosecution would like to call its first witness.
Judge:
A name please, Counsel.
Kazuma:
Naturally...the accused himself.
Ryunosuke:
L-Lord van Zieks?!
Kazuma:
As a prosecutor, he believes in the oath of office he's taken and will be compelled to tell the truth.
Judge:
Very well, let the defendant take the witness stand!
Kazuma:
So, witness...state your name and occupation for the court.
Van Zieks:
Barok van Zieks, Old Bailey prosecutor.
Judge:
I presume, Lord van Zieks, that you heard Prosecutor Asogi's opening precis.
Van Zieks:
I did.
Judge:
It is alleged that you were found at the scene of the crime... ...and that you were arrested by the arriving police officer. Can you confirm this?
Van Zieks:
Yes, My Lord.
Kazuma:
Then I'm sure the court would like to hear you explain some things away. Namely why you were there in the room on Fresno Street at the time in question. And what exactly took place.
Van Zieks:
I intend to explain away nothing. I will simply tell the truth.
Judge:
I must say, Lord van Zieks, I never imagined this day would come. Or rather... ...I didn't want to imagine it would come. But since you became known as the Reaper... ...a part of me has been dreading it.
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
Your formal testimony then, witness!
Witness Testimony
- The Facts of the Incident -
Van Zieks:
I was investigating Gregson, and my inquiries had led me to that address.
When I first entered the room that day, it was dark inside and I saw no one.
A moment later, I heard the gunshot. I spun around, and saw the revolver on the floor.
Just as I picked the firearm up to examine it, the door flew open and I heard a man scream.
It was only then that the body of Inspector Gregson appeared before me.
Kazuma:
That testimony is the whole truth?
Van Zieks:
It was.
Kazuma:
So...you heard a shot being fired in a room with no living occupants... ...and moments later a corpse somehow appeared before your eyes. Is that it? You're right, you haven't explained away anything. In fact that would barely qualify as an excuse.
Van Zieks:
......... I thought you were my mute apprentice. Yet it turns out you have a way with words... Prosecutor Asogi.
Judge:
Hmmm... It would appear to be a singular tale indeed.
Kazuma:
Singular isn't the word. It's laughable.
Ryunosuke:
(What's got into Kazuma? He's not behaving like himself at all...)
Susato:
.........
Judge:
Very well, then. Counsel, you may begin your cross-examination.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!
Cross-Examination
- The Facts of the Incident -
Van Zieks:
I was investigating Gregson, and my inquiries had led me to that address.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You were investigating the inspector? What on earth for?
Van Zieks:
......... I'm not at liberty to say.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Van Zieks:
I'd identified a distinct possibility that Gregson was involved in a case I was investigating. Regrettably, though...he was killed before I could secure the proof I needed.
Judge:
Is the court to understand then, that on the day in question you followed the victim to the scene?
Van Zieks:
...No. I was privy to his movements in advance.
Ryunosuke:
How?
Van Zieks:
I stole into his office in the Yard and consulted his diary. The address on Fresno Street was noted in the 5 p.m. entry.
Kazuma:
You illegally entered the man's office? In Japan that alone would constitute a very serious offence.
Judge:
As it does in Great Britain, I assure you. Is that not the case, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
...I was aware of the possible consequences.
Kazuma:
So, in summary, you were investigating the victim... ...and yet you refuse to tell the court why.
Van Zieks:
.........
Kazuma:
I didn't realise British prosecutors enjoyed such freedom to choose what to divulge under oath.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (Why did I ever think I could defend this man?)
Van Zieks:
When I first entered the room that day, it was dark inside and I saw no one.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Had you ever been to the address before?
Van Zieks:
No, never. I only learnt of the place as a result of my investigations into Gregson's activities. There was no light inside when I entered, so it was all but impossible to make out anything.
Ryunosuke:
But at 5 p.m. the sun would only just have gone down. It would still have been reasonably light outside.
Van Zieks:
The room has a window, but it was boarded shut. Very little light found its way into the room from outside, so it was extremely murky inside. I wouldn't have noticed if the victim was already lying on the floor.
Kazuma:
There was no artificial light in the room, you say? You're quite sure?
Van Zieks:
I'm quite sure that the part of the room where the body was found was very dark. I have a feeling there was a small oil lamp burning on the desk, though I couldn't say for certain.
Susato:
Look, Mr Naruhodo... There is a small desk in the room just here.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I remember. And there was an oil lamp on it. As well as the framed photograph.
Van Zieks:
When I entered the room, I closed the door behind me and started towards the desk to investigate.
Ryunosuke:
And what did you find?
Van Zieks:
Nothing. I never actually reached the desk.
Van Zieks:
A moment later, I heard the gunshot. I spun around, and saw the revolver on the floor.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So...who fired the gun?
Van Zieks:
I have no idea. I didn't see anybody else in the room.
Ryunosuke:
But you say it was very dark in there?
Van Zieks:
Yes, that's right. All I can tell you is, I didn't sense another's presence.
Ryunosuke:
Aha! Then could it be... ...that the gunshot actually originated from somewhere outside the room?!
Van Zieks:
No, that's out of the question.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Van Zieks:
Without doubt, the sound emanated from inside the room. I could smell the gunpowder.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, this is going from bad to worse...)
Kazuma:
And you say that's the point at which you noticed the revolver on the floor?
Van Zieks:
Correct. And I foolishly picked it up. That was carelessness on my part.
Judge:
Presumably, then, the gunshot you heard came from the firearm that you somewhat hastily took in your hands.
Van Zieks:
In point of fact, My Lord...I believe it did not.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Van Zieks:
The barrel of the revolver I picked up was cold, and there was no smell of spent powder.
Ryunosuke:
But, but then...where on earth is the gun that WAS fired?
Van Zieks:
Whilst I would like to oblige you with an answer... ...I'm afraid I can't. I, too, would dearly like to know that.
Ryunosuke:
Uuuuuugh...
Van Zieks:
Just as I picked the firearm up to examine it, the door flew open and I heard a man scream.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
A man, you say? One of the witnesses, I presume?
Kazuma:
That's right. One of the street merchants working on Fresno Street.
Judge:
Who are these merchants?
Kazuma:
A number of them had set up their stalls directly beneath the boarded window of the crime scene. A match-seller, a newsmonger and a pedlar. They've all given statements saying they heard the gunshot. And without thought of danger, they ran inside to see what had happened.
Susato:
Yes...Gina told us about that yesterday, didn't she?
Kazuma:
They burst through the door with some force, it would seem.
Van Zieks:
They did. And almost gave me a heart attack in the process.
Ryunosuke:
(But you're supposed to be the Reaper...)
Van Zieks:
The first man to come in immediately noticed the revolver in my hand and fled.
Kazuma:
A policeman patrolling on Fresno Street heard the commotion... ...and was able to arrest the accused shortly after the incident occurred.
Van Zieks:
Anyway, the man's scream drew my attention in that direction.
Van Zieks:
It was only then that the body of Inspector Gregson appeared before me.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Um...what do you mean by that? In what way did the body 'appear'?
Van Zieks:
I honestly can't explain it. But it's the truth. As far as I was concerned, the body hadn't been there until that point, and then suddenly...there it was.
Ryunosuke:
Did you perhaps hear the sound of the victim falling to the ground just beforehand?
Van Zieks:
......... At that moment, what I heard... ...was the sound of the door flying open and the scream of the man who came inside first. Nothing more.
Ryunosuke:
I see...
Van Zieks:
After the man fled, I examined the body. I was stunned to find that it was Gregson.
Judge:
Hmmm... Most curious circumstances indeed.
Van Zieks:
How the inspector was killed, or how his body seemed to appear out of nowhere... ...I have no idea.
Ryunosuke:
(So...that's Lord van Zieks's account.)
Susato:
Do you have any thoughts, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Yes...mainly that it really doesn't ring true in all sorts of ways. Who fired the gun if there was nobody else there? And how did the corpse just appear in front of him?
Susato:
So...you think that Lord van Zieks is lying?
Ryunosuke:
No, I don't think that. I mean, if he was going to lie... ...I would expect him to have come up with a more credible story, wouldn't you?
Susato:
Yes, I completely agree. I think he genuinely doesn't know what really happened himself. So we must do what we can to fill in the gaps.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, first and foremost, we need more information!
After pressing all statements:
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
Surely the court has heard enough!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
My Lord, the cross-examination has clearly revealed... ...that the accused, Barok van Zieks...is lying on multiple fronts!
Ryunosuke:
Wha... What is THAT supposed to mean?!
Judge:
...Good gracious, Counsel!
The defendant is lying, you say?
Kazuma:
In his testimony just now... ...he claims that he failed to notice the victim's body because the room was dark.
Van Zieks:
That's correct.
Kazuma:
No...that's impossible. As proven by this candelabrum.
Ryunosuke:
How does that prove anything?
Kazuma:
If you examine the tip of the long candle, you can see it has been blown off by a powerful impact.
Judge:
One would assume that the projectile from the firearm passed through the victim and struck the candle.
Kazuma:
The problem comes when you consider the other two candles, which are clearly of a different length.
Judge:
Yes, I can see that only the candle that appears to have been struck by the bullet is long.
Kazuma:
We could reasonably expect someone to have lit all three candles together. Which begs the question of why only one has ended up longer than the others.
Ryunosuke:
That...must be because that particular candle was extinguished when the others were still burning... ...Ah!
Kazuma:
That's right. When the candle was hit by the bullet, it obviously went out. But the other two candles would still have been burning. So the fact is... ...the victim's body would have been illuminated by the light still thrown by the candelabrum! And the accused's claim that he couldn't see the body... clearly contradicts those facts!
Van Zieks:
...!
Kazuma:
And now to the next lie.
Ryunosuke:
There's more?!
Kazuma:
The accused also claims never to have visited the scene of the crime before.
Van Zieks:
That's the truth.
Kazuma:
In that almost empty room, the police discovered something very unusual. A board covered from top to bottom in police documents and newspaper cuttings.
Susato:
Yes, that's right. We saw it, too.
Kazuma:
It goes without saying that the contents of the police documents cannot be divulged. However... ...they included a number of reports from various historical cases. The oldest of which...was from ten years ago.
Ryunosuke:
(Ten years ago? This is starting to sound familiar...)
Kazuma:
And there is a common thread linking all of the documents on that board.
Judge:
Indeed? What is this common thread, Counsel?
Kazuma:
They all relate to cases prosecuted in court by Barok van Zieks.
Ryunosuke:
All of them?
Kazuma:
And furthermore...all those cases are ones in which the defendant was acquitted.
Judge:
Good Lord!
Kazuma:
Interestingly, none of those defendants are alive today. Because all of them have been sent to their graves...by the Reaper.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Susato:
Oh no...
Kazuma:
In short! That dingy little room... ...is the Reaper's secret hideout...and his base of operations!
Ryunosuke:
The, the Reaper's hideout?!
Kazuma:
And yet the Reaper would claim never to have been to his own secret hideout? No one would believe that. No, the truth is...we've been looking at this backwards.
Judge:
Backwards? Explain, Counsel!
Kazuma:
Inspector Gregson was investigating the identity of the Reaper. When he discovered the location of the man's secret hideout...he was killed. As I'm sure everyone can imagine...by the Reaper's hand!
Ryunosuke:
Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Very well. I hereby state the current opinion of the court. Barok van Zieks is an outstanding prosecutor who has rendered great service to his country. However, it is with deep regret that I must concur with Prosecutor Asogi's contention... ...that the defendant's testimony exhibits a number of stark inconsistencies with the known facts.
Van Zieks:
All I have done is state the truth as I know it.
Ryunosuke:
(Kazuma's done a brilliant job as ever. He's drawing on his experience as a defence attorney to build his prosecution case...and it's formidable.)
Judge:
Counsel... ...you will submit the board that you just showed the court as evidence. I believe it to be fundamental in establishing the facts surrounding the Reaper's existence.
Kazuma:
Thank you, My Lord.
The noticeboard has been entered into the Court Record.
Kazuma:
And now, the prosecution would like to call new witnesses to the stand. Witnesses who saw events unfold on the day in question.
Examine evidence
Noticeboard
Front of board
Susato:
There are details of a whole raft of cases dating back years on here, aren't there?
Ryunosuke:
This paper from ten years ago is browning with age, look.
Susato:
Out of interest, the most recent thing appears to be this newspaper cutting here.
Ryunosuke:
Oh. It's the same Red-Headed League advertisement that Mr Sholmes had picked out.
Susato:
And do you remember? There was a red hairpiece at the scene, too.
Ryunosuke:
(Was Inspector Gregson an exponent of the Red-Headed League, then?)
Bloody handprint on back
Susato:
......... Oh. What's this...? Mr Naruhodo! Look!
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes. It's a smudge of some kind. In fact... ...it looks just like a handprint.
Susato:
And the colour... That's blood, isn't it? Oh dear... How disturbing...
The details of the noticeboard have been updated in the Court Record.
Bloody handprint on back (subsequent times)
Susato:
......... Oh. What's this...? Mr Naruhodo! Look!
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes. It's a smudge of some kind. In fact... ...it looks just like a handprint.
Susato:
And the colour... That's blood, isn't it? Oh dear... How disturbing...
Susato:
They were mentioned in the previous testimony too, if you remember.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. The street sellers who heard the gunshot and went running into the room.
Judge:
Very well, lead the witnesses in! The defendant may step down from the witness stand.
Van Zieks:
Certainly, My Lord.
Kazuma:
So...witnesses. State your names and occupations for the court.
???:
Names?! We don't use names. Far too fancy for the likes of uz.
???:
We're just free an' easy. Sell what we like, live where we wanna live...
???:
I g-give them all a vacant stare as they w-walk down Fresno, and spin a few w-words into a verse for them.
Judge:
Ah... Would I be right in assuming that all three of you make your living by selling wares on the street?
Gossip:
Hehe, everyone calls me Gossip. I sell jaunty little titbits to passers-by, you know.
Ryunosuke:
Jaunty little titbits?
Gossip:
Got an absolute smasher for you, sir. Right up your ginnel, it is! Sixpence is the price, and not a penny less!
Ryunosuke:
......... Wait! You're, you're actually trying to sell it to me now?
Gossip:
Oh, c'mon sir! Don't tell me you're not interested!
Kazuma:
Try the man.
Susato:
Give him the money and see what it is!
Judge:
Pay the man, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
Alright, alright, sixpence it is.
Gossip:
You won't regret it, sir! Now, got your listenin' ears on? Just between uz...a young couple on Sleight Street have just had twins!
Ryunosuke:
.........
Gossip:
.........
Ryunosuke:
.........  Um...is that it?
Gossip:
No, that's not it. It's gossip, in't it? It wants to spread. But that bit's up to you and your mouth, of course. I've got more, you know. Want another juicy one? Sixpence a piece, it is. If you're curious...
Ryunosuke:
(I am curious, yes. About what's going on just under that fat bottom lip of yours. Namely that unusual bruise or whatever it is that's poking out from under your collar...)
Kazuma:
What about the next witness, then? What name do you go by and what do you sell?
Venus:
Me? I'm Venus. That's what everyone calls me. Funny, innit? I sell these lovely little fireworks to all the local school kids. Sixpence a pop! What d'you say?
Ryunosuke:
You weren't exaggerating with 'little'. Do they actually sell?
Venus:
Oh yeah. The second years can't get enough of my Venus firecrackers. 'Specially when I tell 'em that if they get a hundred they could blow up the school!
Judge:
Not the most savoury of ideas, young lady.
Venus:
What d'you say then, eh? Wanna part with sixpence for a pop?
Ryunosuke:
Wait, what?! You, you want me to buy one?
Venus:
Tell you what, I'll let you in on a little secret: If you get a hundred of 'em, you could blow up the whole courtroom!
Kazuma:
Try the woman.
Susato:
Give her the money and see if she's right!
Judge:
Pay the woman, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
Alright, alright, I'll buy one.
Venus:
Lovely stuff! Right then...this is something a bit extra, just for you: The Venus Special! Only six 'undred pence!
Ryunosuke:
S-Six hundred!
Venus:
It's a hundred of my regular fireworks. Nothing 'little' about that, is there?
Ryunosuke:
(And there'd be nothing little about the punishment if I blew up the Old Bailey, either.)
The Venus firecracker has been entered into the Court Record.
Kazuma:
And the last witness... What name do you go by and what do you sell?

Venus Firecracker

Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
Have you had an idea, Mr Naruhodo? You're staring at the end of the string of fireworks.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry. It's just that it's the 'Venus Special'. I was wondering what six hundred pence worth of fireworks would sound like.
Susato:
......... Shall we find out?
Ryunosuke:
What? B-But...she said it could blow up the courtroom!
...*BANG!*
Ryunosuke:
......... A-Alright, that was a fairly sizeable bang.
Susato:
My ears are still ringing, Mr Naruhodo. It sounded almost exactly like...

???:
I'm a th-thinker me. Think all sorts of thoughts. I think, therefore I am. I am, therefore I think...I think. Because I stand there on the street, w-watchin' the w-world go on about me, they call me 'The Observator'.
Gossip:
Get out if it, old man! Everyone calls you Sandwich and you know it.
Kazuma:
So...you don't actually sell anything?
Sandwich:
A p-p-problem shared is a problem halved, as they say. I give advice, I do. And think w-what it means. I d-don't actually sell anything, no...come to think of it.
Kazuma:
Pity.
Ryunosuke:
(No more purchases today...please.)
Judge:
Well, we have quite a cast here, it seems.
Kazuma:
They conduct their business on Fresno Street from morning until night, My Lord. And always in the same place: directly adjacent to the crime scene.
Judge:
I see. And thus they heard the gunshot, I suppose.
Kazuma:
Not only that, but they very bravely ran inside to see what was going on and witnessed the crime.
Gossip:
Well I'll be beggared, I thought! ...Just between uz.
Venus:
Venus de Milo, what am I to do? What a terrible thing I saw!
Sandwich:
W-What I think is...if all w-what we see is light and shadow, p-playing with our eyes...is any of it real?
Judge:
Very well. The court will hear the formal testimony of these three witnesses now. You will describe in detail what you witnessed and heard at the time of the incident.
Witness Testimony
- The Witnesses' Account -
Gossip:
We saw the whole thing from start to finish, we did. Everything from the moment they went in the building.
Venus:
It was less than a minute after the Reaper had gone inside that we all 'eard a big bang.
Sandwich:
Seems to m-me that quick-to-talk is quick-to-walk. Gossip couldn't wait to go and see what had happened.
Gossip:
I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!
Venus:
I was scared 'alf to death, me. So I ran off to find a copper.
Ryunosuke:
If these witnesses were there the whole day and saw everything... ...who did they see going inside the building?
Kazuma:
Only the victim, Inspector Gregson, and the accused, Barok van Zieks.
Gossip:
I've seen pictures of that Reaper in the paper. I know what he looks like. And just between uz...folk love stories like this. I've made meself a tidy sum already.
Ryunosuke:
But wait! The room was just one of several flats in the building. Someone from another flat could have done it!
Kazuma:
All those flats on Fresno Street are unoccupied.
Gossip:
'Course they are. They're small, damp, dirty and expensive to boot.
Kazuma:
The room in which the inspector was found is the only property in the building that's currently leased.
Susato:
And we know the leaseholder's name, don't we. It's...Hugh Boone.
Judge:
Hmmm... The testimony the court has just heard would appear to leave little room for doubt. It's becoming increasingly difficult to see how anyone other than the defendant could have committed the crime.
Ryunosuke:
No!
Kazuma:
Thank you for your candour, My Lord.
Judge:
Counsel for the Defence, you may proceed to cross-examine the witnesses.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord! (In a closed court like this without a jury, the judge is the only person whose opinion matters. I have to break down this testimony. Somehow!)
Cross-Examination

Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
When you say 'they', who do you mean exactly? Inspector Gregson and the defendant, Lord van Zieks?
Gossip:
I suppose so. The likes of uz don't know the names of the high and mighty. But I'll tell you one thing...it was the old Reaper that went in last, that's for sure and certain.
Ryunosuke:
Just behind Inspector Gregson? Did they arrive at the same time as each other?
Gossip:
No no, not at all! The first fella must have gone inside a good fifteen minutes before we heard that gunshot.
Ryunosuke:
The victim arrived fifteen minutes before?! Are you sure about that?
Gossip:
Am I sure? Am I sure?! Doz it seem likely that I'd have forgotten a fella with bright red hair like that, doz it?
Venus:
Yeah, 'is hair really were red, weren't it? Redder than my flamin' fireworks, even.
Sandwich:
That, that fiery red mop's still b-burnt on the inside of my eyelids, it is.
Ryunosuke:
Wait a minute! You're saying the man was a red-head?
Gossip:
Weren't you listenin', chum? Aye, he woz a red-head. And he had a big trunk with him, as well.
Susato:
But Inspector Gregson's hair isn't red. Not by any stretch of the imagination!
Ryunosuke:
It seems likely that the person you saw wasn't in fact Inspector Gregson at all, but some other third party.
Kazuma:
No. I hate to break it to you, but the witnesses are correct.
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Kazuma:
Just have a look at this photograph of the victim taken at the scene.
Ryunosuke:
Y-Yes, that's... (That's Inspector Gregson alright.)
Susato:
And...a red hairpiece.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Susato:
Of course! We saw one on the floor when we investigated the scene, didn't we?
Ryunosuke:
I still refuse to believe Inspector Gregson wore a hairpiece, though... (So then why on earth would he have been wearing something like that?)
Judge:
Hm...the colour does seem to suit the man, one might say... The photograph will be submitted as evidence, please, Counsel.
The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
And what became of the trunk that the red-headed victim was supposedly carrying?
Kazuma:
...I was informed that no trunk was found at the scene.
Ryunosuke:
(So it just disappeared?)
Gossip:
What, do you expect uz to have been watchin' the buildin' every second, do you?
Venus:
We definitely saw 'im in the dock goin' in, though. No question about that!

Ryunosuke:

Ryunosuke:
By which presumably you mean the gunshot?
Venus:
I sell these little things, don't I? How would I know what a gunshot sounds like? But I've always thought it probably sounds a bit like this... doesn't it?
Ryunosuke:
And you say that you heard the noise almost as soon as you saw the defendant here enter the building?
Venus:
That's right. It was almost straight away. 'Bang!' it went. Just like that.
Gossip:
Well he's the Reaper, in't he? It's what the French call a fait accompli. When the Reaper's around, people are goin' in the ground! I mean, that's what he doz, in't it?
Ryunosuke:
I think we get the message.
Kazuma:
The Reaper couldn't allow the inspector to live after he'd discovered his secret hideout. There can be no clearer motive for the crime.
Judge:
Hmmm...yes... It's certainly an eminently credible motive.
Ryunosuke:
(Great.)
Kazuma:
And at that point, you ran inside. Is that correct?
Sandwich:
Seems to m-me that quick-to-talk is quick-to-walk. Gossip couldn't wait to go and see what had happened.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So, when Gossip ran to see what had happened, did you go, too?
Sandwich:
W-Well me... I'm a b-bit hampered, see. All the signs are that, that I c-can't move very well.
Kazuma:
You were a way behind, presumably. With that sandwich board around your neck and that big sign in your hand.
Ryunosuke:
...What a great burden you bear. Pardon me for asking, Mr, erm...Sandwich, but... ...is it possible you and I have met before?
Sandwich:
...! I-I'm not anybody, me. The signs are w-what make me who I am right now. I sign, therefore I am.
Ryunosuke:
So...you weren't employed as an omnibus driver just under a year ago then?
Sandwich:
.........
Susato:
I might be mistaken, but I believe his trembling has intensified, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I agree. He's clearly been through a lot.
Sandwich:
'Turn down King Henry Street and the Black Widowers Arms is just there.'
Susato:
Oh dear. You've made him hide behind his sign.
Ryunosuke:
(Life is full of surprises...)
Gossip:
I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So then you were the first person to arrive on the scene. Is that right?
Gossip:
That I woz! Kicked the door open like a professional, I did! And yelled out, 'What's goin' off 'ere?!'
Susato:
Lord van Zieks claims all he heard was a man's scream, though.
Ryunosuke:
And was it dark inside the room?
Gossip:
No, not dark at all! There were candles burnin' on the wall.
Ryunosuke:
Really?!
Gossip:
And there was a fella collapsed on the floor. Just between uz...it's the first thing I noticed when I got inside.
Ryunosuke:
Ah. I, I see... (Even though Lord van Zieks claims not to have seen any such lights on the wall...)
Gossip:
The next thing I noticed was someone standin' right beside the body.
Kazuma:
The accused, Barok van Zieks...
Gossip:
That's right! The pale-faced Reaper himself! I woz a little shocked, I won't deny it. But I'm no lily-livered coward. I stood my ground and gave that Reaper a cold, hard stare myself!
Pursue "Sandwich" (after pressing first statement)
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Do you have something to add, Mr Sandwich?!
Sandwich:
......... There's, there's really n-n-nothing to me. Empty in the head, I am. Just two slices with no middle. S-So I don't know what you could w-w-want with me.
Ryunosuke:
I think that maybe you just remembered something? Having heard Mr Gossip's last statement, I mean.
Sandwich:
W-What I think is...we're all nothings really. We try to d-dress ourselves up as something else, but at the end of the day, w-we're all just street sellers.
Gossip:
That's enough out of you, Sandwich. Keep your trap shut now. Unless you want uz to make you into a real sandwich!
Sandwich:
W-When he saw the Reaper, he f-f-fell clean over on his backside!
Ryunosuke:
...That's it?
Gossip:
Oh, you rotten beggar! I told you to keep that a secret!
Sandwich:
He screamed, he did. Screamed and s-scrambled off on all fours. ...That's all I w-w-wanted to say.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Gossip! Is this true?
Gossip:
The floor was dead slippery, that's why. Planted my hand in a filthy pool of blood, didn't I? Yuck!
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?! (A pool of blood?)
Gossip:
But listen here! Even when I woz sprawled on the floor... ...I still kept giving that Reaper a cold, hard stare! And don't you forget it!
Ryunosuke:
Let's just go back a little. Did you say you got blood on your hand?
Gossip:
I, I did, aye. Happens to the best of uz at times, dozn't it? So I was scared! So I slipped over! ...We can keep it just between uz, can't we?
Ryunosuke:
No, Mr Gossip! I'm going to have to ask you to add that information to your formal testimony.
Gossip:
Oh... If I must.
Judge:
The witness will amend his testimony to include the aforementioned details at once.
Kazuma:
.........
Changes statement from "I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!" to "I slipped over and got blood on my hand, so I quickly wiped it off on the floor."
Ryunosuke:
And was there anyone else in the room at the time?
Gossip:
No, of course not. Not at first. But then this old stiff came waddlin' along behind me, of course. Only him, mind.
Sandwich:
I, I can't handle stairs so well, as you can imagine. Especially on the w-w-way up.
Ryunosuke:
And you couldn't have just failed to see someone?
Gossip:
It was a bit dingy in there, I grant you. But there were the candles on the wall. And the lamp on the table.
Sandwich:
There was n-nowhere anyone c-could have been hiding. You m-mark my eyes!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...)
Gossip:
I slipped over and got blood on my hand, so I quickly wiped it off on the floor.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You wiped your hand on the floor?
Gossip:
Well...who wants blood on his hand, eh? Horrible stuff. And they might have thought I'd done it. Hmph! No ta!
Ryunosuke:
And you didn't think that might be a problem?
Gossip:
Doz it really matter if I left a few grubby handprints on the floor? They'll get cleaned up in the end, won't they? Don't make such a fuss, that's the message from all of uz!
Kazuma:
.........
Judge:
Is something wrong, Counsel?
Kazuma:
No, My Lord. I didn't remember anything in the report about a bloody handprint on the floor, that's all.
Gossip:
D-Don't come at me with all that! You can't intimidate me! I know what I did! I wiped it off! On the floor! The blood!
Ryunosuke:
......... (I wonder... Could that be what happened...?)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
I don't have all the answers yet... ...but I think we may have just uncovered a vital clue!
Present Noticeboard (after examining bloody handprint on back)

"So you wiped off the blood from your hand on the floor of the room..."
Venus:
I was scared 'alf to death, me. So I ran off to find a copper.

Ryunosuke:

Ryunosuke:
So you didn't run into the room with your friends?
Venus:
......... I'm not that sort of girl.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Venus:
I'm a timid little thing, me. I was too scared to go in there.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, right... I see.
Venus:
Old Lippy and the 'Wich ran in there, an' then I 'eard a sort of old lady scream.
Gossip:
Well that wozn't me, I swear. If I were a gentleman, I'd stake my honour on it.
Venus:
I wondered what on earth was goin' on.
Ryunosuke:
Which is when you went to find a policeman?
Venus:
And I ran into a copper as soon as I turned the corner. So I brought him straight back to the place. ...Didn't I do well, eh?
Gossip:
Just between uz...that copper's eyes nearly popped out of his head when he saw the Reaper.
Sandwich:
I've n-n-never felt more uncomfortable in, in all my life.
Judge:
And the defendant was arrested on the spot, I believe.
Kazuma:
Considering the catalogue of killings the Reaper had carried out... ...it was a particularly inauspicious end.
Ryunosuke:
(...If I can't find any holes in this testimony...)
Susato:
I'm afraid the judge will give a ruling of guilty, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
(The truth is, though, their combined testimony is fairly damning.)
Susato:
Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any obvious problems with their statements, do there?
Ryunosuke:
Still...if Lord van Zieks really is innocent, then I'm almost certain... ...that we'll find something in there that doesn't quite add up.
Susato:
You don't think... ...that one of these three could be the true culprit, do you?
Ryunosuke:
I don't know. But what I do know... ...is that there's more to this case that has yet to be brought to light!
Ryunosuke:
So you wiped off the blood from your hand on the floor of the room... Are you quite sure about that?
Gossip:
Well, well what else d'you expect me to have done, eh? Doz it really matter?
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
The police found no such handprint on the floor during their investigations. What exactly is the defence asserting?!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
If you listen, you'll find out...Prosecutor Asogi.
Kazuma:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Certainly, there was no bloody handprint found...on the floor.
Kazuma:
What are you trying to say?
Ryunosuke:
There was a handprint in blood left very clearly at the scene... ...on the back of this noticeboard.
Gossip:
Ah...ah...AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Judge:
Ah yes, indeed. Indisputably a handprint in the distinctive colour of blood.
Gossip:
Aye, you're dead right! That's my right hand! I'd know it anywhere!
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
The witness very definitely testified that he wiped his hand on the floor. Any handprints on the back of the board are irrelevant!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Not if the board itself had fallen over onto the floor. In that case, it's quite possible for the witness's handprint to have ended up there.
Kazuma:
...Just look at the floor plan of the room. The noticeboard was in the opposite corner of the room to the victim, and in an upright position. Even if it had somehow been toppled and was lying on the floor at the time... ...it would have been a considerable distance from the body.
Gossip:
I fell over when I came across the body. So I woz basically right next to the corpse. Not on the other side of the room!
Kazuma:
In other words, the defence's assertion is contradictory!
Ryunosuke:
Yes...it is.
Kazuma:
...!
Ryunosuke:
There's a very definite contradiction here...for which there must be a reason.
Judge:
I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel? Regarding this apparent discrepancy between the witness's account and the handprint found at the scene.
Ryunosuke:
I have, My Lord. This discrepancy between the witness's account and the location of the handprint is explained by...
Another handprint
Ryunosuke:
If Mr Gossip ended up with blood on his hand and wiped it off on the floor as he says... ...it must have left behind a mark somewhere. Just as a mark has been left behind on the back of the noticeboard.
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
The prosecution has already established that the handprint on the board is irrelevant.
Ryunosuke:
Exactly! Which means there must be another handprint somewhere!
Kazuma:
No! The police report made no mention of a handprint anywhere on the floor! And I understand that you've examined the scene in person, too. If you'd come across something the police had missed... how do you explain the cold sweat?
Judge:
Quite. The defence counsel's cold sweat is a sure indication that a penalty is due.
Ryunosuke:
That sweat was just from the warm-up.
Kazuma:
What?
Ryunosuke:
There should be a bloody handprint on the floor. So where did it go...? I'm ready to give the proper explanation to the court now, My Lord!
Leads back to:
"I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel?"
The board moving
Leads to:
"The real contradiction here is the handprint itself, not where it was found."
False testimony
Ryunosuke:
The witness claims to have wiped his bloody hand on the floor, yet no sign of that remains at the scene. The simplest explanation is that the witness is lying.
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
Just because it's the simplest explanation doesn't make it the correct one...Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Kazuma:
Positing perjury simply because it suits you... You bring shame on your Japanese heritage!
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAARGH!
Judge:
I would ask you not to oversimplify matters again, Counsel.
Kazuma:
I don't remember fostering that kind of simplistic thinking in you.
Ryunosuke:
...Since when were you my father? Anyway, I was always taught to consider all possibilities.
Kazuma:
Then show me.
Ryunosuke:
There should be a bloody handprint on the floor. So where did it go...? I'm ready to give the proper explanation to the court now, My Lord!
Leads back to:
"I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel?"
Ryunosuke:
The real contradiction here is the handprint itself, not where it was found. As the court can see...it's upside down.
Judge:
Good gracious! So it is! If the witness had put his hand against the board, the fingers should be pointing upwards.
Kazuma:
What, what does that tell us?
Ryunosuke:
It tells one simple fact! When this handprint was made... ...the board must have been lying on the floor as I previously suggested. Which means that after the incident...it must have been moved!
Kazuma:
What?!
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
You're claiming that somebody moved the noticeboard after the shooting? Then tell the court who!
Ryunosuke:
I, I don't know that yet! But the point is... ...when you consider all the testimony we've heard so far, we can now be very clear on one point!
Judge:
And that would be...?
Ryunosuke:
The position of the noticeboard at the time of the incident, My Lord.
Judge:
So, Counsel, I must ask you to clarify your assertion for the court. At the time of the incident, where do you maintain the noticeboard was situated?
Present area between doorway and victim
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"This is the only possible location!"
Present anywhere else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
It was right here, My Lord!
Judge:
Goodness! Hm, no...I'm afraid I don't quite see your logic.
Kazuma:
I'm disappointed, Ryunosuke. In Japan, we're taught to have patience and respect for our elders. So until His Lordship sees your logic, you will know your place and not move from that spot!
Ryunosuke:
UAAAAAAGH!
Susato:
How brilliant of Kazuma-sama! That almost sounded unreasonable at first, but he was just thinking of you.
Ryunosuke:
Unreasonable? Try unfathomable. Anyway, I think I have the answer now. I know my place! ...Or rather, I know the board's place!
Leads back to:
"So, Counsel, I must ask you to clarify your assertion for the court."
Ryunosuke:
This is the only possible location!
Judge:
Immediately adjacent to the doorway...?
Ryunosuke:
If the court would think back to the testimony given by the defendant earlier... ...he said that when he entered the room it was dark, and he couldn't see the body.
Gossip:
By 'eck!
Ryunosuke:
If the noticeboard had been here, the body would have been completely hidden from view. And the light from the candles would have been blocked, making the room appear darker.
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
But the accused also claims that the victim's body simply 'appeared' before him.
Susato:
That's true. Or, in his precise words...
Van Zieks:
Just as I picked the firearm up to examine it, the door flew open and I heard a man scream. It was only then that the body of Inspector Gregson appeared before me.
Gossip:
I don't know about callin' it a 'scream', but he woz talkin' about me and no mistake. Cos it woz me that kicked the door open.
Ryunosuke:
If you look again at the floor plan... ...consider what would happen if the door to the room was thrown open with force.
Kazuma:
That, that can't...
Ryunosuke:
The door struck the noticeboard, knocking it over, and making the victim's body visible.
Judge:
Good gracious!
Ryunosuke:
My client has told nothing but the truth! He has simply described what he saw.
Kazuma:
Argh!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Counsel, how has this not come to light before now?
Ryunosuke:
After the incident, somebody must have righted the board and moved it... ...into the position where the police, myself and my colleague saw it when investigating the room.
Judge:
Witness! What have you to say for yourself?
Gossip:
Whaaaaaat? Me, My Lord?
Ryunosuke:
You and your fellows were there at the scene before anybody else. It goes without saying that you must know something about the position of the noticeboard!
Judge:
The witnesses in the stand will testify again. You will each explain exactly what you did upon arriving at the scene of the crime!
Gossip:
Eh, stop lookin' over your glasses at me! I get the message.
Witness Testimony
- The Mystery of the Moving Board -
Gossip:
I don't know anythin' about that there noticeboard! I just wiped my hand on it, that's all.
Venus:
Well don't look at me. I 'aven't got a clue about it. I was doin' business with some second years at the time.
Sandwich:
I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life.
Gossip:
It woz that Reaper, I bet. He's got a face that screams 'board'.
Sandwich:
I c-can't see how this changes anything anyway. The detective still died w-when we heard the gunshot.
Judge:
Hmmm... So none of you can elaborate further...
Kazuma:
Shaken by the crime they witnessed, and with only the light of a few candles and an oil lamp by which to see... ...we can't expect these witnesses to be able to give a more precise account of what happened.
Venus:
That's right, yeah. It don't pay to expect too much.
Sandwich:
It's m-man's endless quest for knowledge that's d-d-destroying the world. That's w-what I think.
Ryunosuke:
...Do you? Really.
Kazuma:
In any case, as the testimony shows... ...even if the noticeboard was moved by somebody following the incident, it makes no difference. When the gunshot rang out, the accused was the only person at the scene.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
In short, the only person who could possibly have committed this crime...is Barok van Zieks! None of this wrangling over the board changes that simple fact.
Judge:
Quite so, quite so. Does the defence still wish to cross-examine the witnesses despite the circumstances?
Ryunosuke:
Most certainly, My Lord.
Judge:
Very well. Then you may proceed, Counsel.
Cross-Examination
- The Mystery of the Moving Board -
Gossip:
I don't know anythin' about that there noticeboard! I just wiped my hand on it, that's all.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So you admit that it was the board you wiped your bloody hand on?
Gossip:
Admit it? What's to admit? It's there plain as day for all to see: a smashing print of my right hand!
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps you wanted to hide that handprint... ...so you righted the noticeboard and pushed it into the corner, did you?
Gossip:
No no! Imagine the weight of that great lump! Do I look like a powerful and well-nurtured man?
Ryunosuke:
Well did you see anybody else moving the board?
Gossip:
I've got nerves of steel, I can tell you, but even I have my limits. There woz a body on the floor in front of me, and the grim Reaper himself standin' over it. And there woz precious little light inside, either. My bottom lip was all aquiver.
Kazuma:
In other words...this witness is unable to give definite testimony on that point.
Judge:
Hm, yes...so it would seem.
Venus:
Well don't look at me. I 'aven't got a clue about it. I was doin' business with some second years at the time.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
When you say you were doing business with them, you mean you were selling them fireworks?
Venus:
Yeah, what else? There's the Priory School just round the corner, see. Those cheeky little so-and-sos 'ave got a plan to blow their school to kingdom come.
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Venus:
So I've been tellin' on them. Lettin' their teachers know what they're up to.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...you have?
Venus:
Yeah, wouldn't want anyone to get 'urt. So I let the school know the kids are playin' with dodgy toys. Then - praise the Lord - the teachers take all the fireworks off 'em. And then - praise the Lord again - the kids all come back to me to buy more. Everyone's 'appy, see?
Ryunosuke:
...What a racket.
Venus:
'Course. And sometimes the teachers give me a little bonus to thank me for lettin' 'em know. It's a busy old life, sellin' explosives.
Judge:
Venus is a guileful goddess indeed...
Venus:
Well, tellin' bare-faced lies is kind of my thing, really. I'm ever so good at it.
Pursue "Sandwich"
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Something wrong, Mr Sandwich?
Sandwich:
If, if I said it was, could we just l-leave it at that? Would that be the end of it?
Ryunosuke:
Um...no. Did Miss Venus's statement just now bring something to mind, perhaps?
Sandwich:
......... Philosophical thoughts. Deep, philosophical thoughts.
Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Sandwich:
L-Let's say there was a great liar. And that g-great liar said, without batting an eye... 'Tellin' bare-faced lies is kind of my thing. I'm ever so good at it.' W-Would those words of hers be a lie, too? Or the truth? In which case...she's n-not a liar. Ooh, it's a h-hellish paradox, that one. Don't you think?
Ryunosuke:
......... I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. But...it seems to me you're suggesting Miss Venus has been lying...are you?
Sandwich:
..................
Venus:
What are you on about, old man? Tryin' to cause trouble, are you? Keep on like that... ...and I'll wrap your whole body in firecrackers and set 'em off. That'll give you somethin' to tremble about!
Judge:
You have a startlingly disturbing mind behind that sweet and innocent face, young lady.
Ryunosuke:
So Miss Venus HAS lied in her testimony! Is that what you're saying, Mr Sandwich?
Sandwich:
......... Well...if it m-means I'll be burnin' in hellfire for the r-rest of my days...so be it. Yes, that's what I'm saying.
Kazuma:
Can you elaborate, please, sir?
Sandwich:
......... Old b-blabbermouth here headed for the r-room where the g-gunshot seemed to come from... ...but there w-w-was someone else who crept up the stairs b-behind him, too. That's right! That rotten liar over there!
Venus:
Heh heh...
Ryunosuke:
.........
Kazuma:
.........
Judge:
Do you mean to say... ...that you did in fact betake yourself to the scene of the crime after all?
Venus:
......... What did I tell you, eh? I said I was good at tellin' bare-faced lies, didn't I?
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, you mentioned it...)
Susato:
Well... ...that revelation rocked the whole courtroom, didn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Who knew firecrackers packed such a punch?
Judge:
So you did indeed visit the scene of the crime, did you, young lady? Good grief!
Venus:
Well, now you come to mention it... ...I suppose perhaps I do clearly remember climbin' the stairs to the room, yeah.
Ryunosuke:
Either you clearly remember it or you don't.
Judge:
Well...I shall consider a fitting punishment for this perjurious act later. For the time being, you will immediately amend your testimony to reflect the truth!
Venus:
Oh yes, My Lord. Of course!
Changes statement from "Well don't look at me. I 'aven't got a clue about it. I was doin' business with some second years at the time." to "Maybe I did sneak along behind Gossip and 'ave a little peek into the room where it all 'appened."
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...scary.)
Kazuma:
...The important point is, you didn't go inside the room where the inspector was killed, isn't that right?
Venus:
Definitely not. Wouldn't 'ave dreamed of it, would I?
Venus:
Maybe I did sneak along behind Gossip and 'ave a little peek into the room where it all 'appened.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You make a habit of lying, do you, Miss Venus?
Venus:
Well...I s'pose so. ...I don't really know, to be fair. If you want my advice, though, I'd take everythin' I say with a big pinch of salt.
Ryunosuke:
Alright, but you did in fact go to the room where the victim was killed on the day in question, didn't you?
Venus:
Oh, please! As if I would! I can't think of anythin' more terrifyin'!
Kazuma:
The truth, please.
Venus:
Well alright, just a bit then. I mean, a girl my age is curious about stuff, ya know!
Ryunosuke:
Did you touch anything at the scene?
Venus:
Oh, please! As if I would! I mean, there was a dead body on the floor!
Kazuma:
The truth, please.
Venus:
Well alright, just a bit then. I 'ad a look to see if there was anythin' I could sell. So I did give the place a once-over. But it was nothin' to write 'ome about.
Ryunosuke:
Right. Now, I hesitate to ask, but... ...you didn't move the noticeboard by any chance, did you?
Venus:
Oh, please! As if I would touch anythin' like that! Just a few bits of loose change is all I 'ad!
Kazuma:
The truth, please.
Venus:
Well alright then. I thought there might be somethin' worth 'avin' underneath it. So I blasted the flippin' thing- Sorry, flipped the blasted thing.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
...!
Judge:
...!
Kazuma:
You're, you're telling us... ...that you DID move that board?!
Venus:
I think that did slip out, didn't it?
Gossip:
Wha...? You daft barmpot!
Sandwich:
I, I don't believe it... The girl doesn't think.
Ryunosuke:
So! Did you find anything then? Something that you might have taken, perhaps? To sell?
Venus:
Oh, please! I should be so lucky! In my imagination-
Kazuma:
The TRUTH now!
Venus:
...I might 'ave found this old pocket watch under the noticeboard, I s'pose. But a bit o' junk like this can't be worth much, if you ask-
???:
AAAAAAAAAH!
Gina:
So it was you, was it? You're the one wot took it!
Ryunosuke:
G-Gina?!
Judge:
Young lady! May I remind you where you are?!
Gina:
That watch... That watch there... That was a present to Inspector Gregson from the Yard for a big case 'e solved ten years ago!
Susato:
The Professor case, no doubt.
Gina:
The boss used to wind it up every evenin' wivout fail when 'e was waitin' for 'is grub to come at the pub.
Ryunosuke:
...I see.
Gina:
I swiped it off 'im once an' blimey was 'e upset! 'E gave me a right earful. Said 'e 'adn't missed a day in the last ten years, polishin' it an' windin' it. It meant the world to 'im, that watch did.
Ryunosuke:
(Possibly not the best thing to go diving for, then...)
Venus:
It's not all that, though. I took it to Jabez's that night to ask 'ow much it was worth. But the old dealer wouldn't touch it. Wouldn't give me a penny for it. Said it wasn't workin'. Knocked about and worthless he called it.
Gina:
Agh! I knew I should've lifted it!
Kazuma:
That watch must be submitted as evidence at once!
Venus:
Oh, please! Just, just so long as you promise to give it back when we're done!
Gina:
Not a chance! I'll swipe it from ya if you try to get your grubby mitts on it again!
Judge:
That's enough. Hand the watch to the bailiff forthwith!
Ryunosuke:
(Now now, children, watch your manners...)
Judge:
......... Good Lord! The glass appears to be broken.
Kazuma:
More than likely, it shattered when the inspector was shot.
Venus:
It doesn't tick any more, either. Which is why Jabez didn't want it. What a waste, eh?
Judge:
Yes, indeed. It appears to have stopped at the hour of five.
Ryunosuke:
(Exactly when the gunshot was heard, then...)
Susato:
Which supports the prosecution's claim, of course...
Gregson's pocket watch has been entered into the Court Record.
Judge:
Well, it would appear that the mystery of the moving noticeboard has been solved at least.
Kazuma:
And as predicted, it had very little bearing on the case.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Judge:
Now then, continue with your cross-examination, please, Counsel.
Press (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You...certainly know how to lie...
Venus:
Oh, it was nothin' really. Just a little porky.
Ryunosuke:
With not-so-little implications...
Venus:
Did you know? Everythin' in the world apart from the truth is a big fat lie! ...If you believe that, of course.
Ryunosuke:
...I'm lost.
Judge:
As am I. This desecration of the truth is really rather disturbing. I think perhaps we should move on to the next witness, hm?
Examine evidence
Gregson's Pocket Watch
Cracked glass
Ryunosuke:
The glass over the face really is badly cracked, look.
Susato:
What a shame when the inspector clearly looked after it so carefully.
Ryunosuke:
I imagine Mr Sholmes could repair it, don't you?
Susato:
Yes, I should think so.
Ryunosuke:
(He's very adept at things like this. A useful man to have around, in fact.)
Susato:
But kindly remember that he's a great detective, Mr Naruhodo! Not an odd-job man.
Stub on top
Ryunosuke:
There's a tiny little stub sticking out from this small hole here, look.
Susato:
I suppose there must have been a little knob or something on that for setting the time.
Ryunosuke:
In that case, seeing as we know the inspector took such good care of this watch... ...it probably broke when the incident occurred, didn't it?
Susato:
Yes! Of course!
Ryunosuke:
Which could mean that there's a small part of the watch still at the scene, maybe...
Keyhole at bottom
Ryunosuke:
Ah... There's a tiny little keyhole here. Can you see?
Susato:
Oh yes. That's probably for the winder used to wind up the mechanism.
Ryunosuke:
It looks a little unusual, don't you think?
Susato:
Yes, you'd need just the right key to wind it, I imagine.
Ryunosuke:
......... (Why do I feel as though I've seen something...? Something a bit like a key that's about the right size to fit in this hole...)
Susato:
It would be wonderful if we had the key... Let's check carefully over what we've already found.
Keyhole at bottom (after examining key on Policeman Figurine)
Ryunosuke:
So this is where the little policeman figurine's key goes in to wind the watch. Winding it up every single day for ten years without fail...
Susato:
Yes, it was obviously a thing of great importance to the inspector.
Ryunosuke:
(Or a reminder of the past, lest he forget...)
Policeman Figurine
Head of figurine, then key (after examining keyhole on Gregson's Pocket Watch)
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato! Do you think perhaps this key... ...could be the key for Inspector Gregson's watch?
Susato:
Oh! Yes, it could be! Let's try it at once! There's not a moment to lose!
Ryunosuke:
(I knew it! A perfect fit!)
Susato:
And look! The inspector's watch has started going again!
Ryunosuke:
Ah, so it has obviously just not been wound up, that's all.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
What is it, Miss Susato?
Susato:
Well...if the watch isn't actually broken after all... ...I have a feeling it could have profound implications! .........
Ryunosuke:
(She's deep in thought now. Perhaps I'd better start thinking deeply, too...)
The details of Gregson's pocket watch have been updated in the Court Record.
Key (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
So this is the little key used to wind the inspector's pocket watch.
Susato:
It was a mystery at first. Why it should be a policeman, I mean. But it's because it was a gift from Scotland Yard, in recognition of Inspector Gregson's hard work.
Ryunosuke:
...If its head did fall off from overuse, it might seem a little inappropriate, don't you think?
Susato:
That's...the British sense of humour for you, I think.
Head of figurine (after examining key)
Susato:
The helmet of this charming policeman appears to be a little worse for wear.
Ryunosuke:
I'm not convinced about the 'charming' part, but yes, you're right... ...the head part looks like it's been fairly heavily manhandled. Which stands to reason, really, doesn't it? I mean, it gets turned around and around every day.
Susato:
...I hope it doesn't fall off in the end.
Sandwich:
I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
But...you did go to see what had happened in the room, didn't you?
Sandwich:
Fresno Street is my whole w-w-world. It's all I know. And I know all of it. I have to make it my b-business to know, if I want to h-hold my sign up high.
Kazuma:
So you did go to see what had happened.
Sandwich:
It's not the d-destination that's important...it's h-how you get there, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Did you notice the noticeboard in the room?
Sandwich:
...If you think about it, we're b-both the same species, aren't we? Both different members of the sign family. So if I'd spotted it, I m-might have tried to t-trip it up out of a sense of rivalry, I admit.
Ryunosuke:
(Someone really needs to tell you that you're Homo sapiens not Homo signiens...)
Kazuma:
Does that mean that you didn't notice the board?
Sandwich:
I, I can only r-r-repeat what I said before: I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life.
Judge:
...In which case, just who was responsible for moving the noticeboard?
Gossip:
It woz that Reaper, I bet. He's got a face that screams 'board'.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
What exactly do you mean by that?
Gossip:
Oh, come on now, don't tell uz you've not noticed. He looks like he hates everythin' in the world, that fella. But not noticeboards. They're the one thing he likes. You can see it in his eyes.
Ryunosuke:
...I can't say I'd ever noticed.
Gossip:
I'll tell you one thing for free, though: I never took my eyes off that man on the floor. Or off the Reaper. Not for a second.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gossip:
Well, I was that scared, I couldn't. You never know what a fiend like that might do if you look away, do you?
Ryunosuke:
......... If you didn't take your eyes off the defendant... ...you should be able to confirm categorically whether or not he was the one who moved the noticeboard.
Gossip:
......... Aye, that I can. The Reaper did nothin' of the sort. I can swear to that! I couldn't have missed it if he'd heaved the thing upright again and dragged it into the corner!
Ryunosuke:
Right...glad we've cleared that up.
Kazuma:
What happened to the face that screams 'board'?
Ryunosuke:
(I feel your pain, Kazuma.)
Sandwich:
I c-can't see how this changes anything anyway. The detective still died w-when we heard the gunshot.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
...It was five o'clock in the afternoon that you all heard the loud bang, wasn't it?
Sandwich:
Maybe the n-noticeboard fell over, or maybe it d-didn't. Maybe I fell over, or m-m-maybe I didn't... But the Reaper's f-fate is sealed either way, because of that gunshot w-we all heard. So your fate's sealed, too.
Ryunosuke:
My fate?!
Kazuma:
That's right. The defence is fated to lose. And the prosecution to win.
Ryunosuke:
(In other words, it all hinges on that single gunshot. So if I could just find some problem with that part of their story...)
Susato:
It may be possible to change all our fates!
Sandwich:
Of course...n-none of that changes the fact that I heard what I heard...does it?
Present Gregson's Pocket Watch (after examining keyhole on Gregson's Pocket Watch, then examining key on Policeman Figurine)
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I'm afraid that's not necessarily the case."
Ryunosuke:
(Not much to go on...)
Susato:
As you've pointed out, Mr Naruhodo... ...there's no question that the noticeboard was moved. So somebody must have done it.
Ryunosuke:
But it did happen after the event, so... ...maybe Kazuma is right and it's not relevant to the case.
Susato:
But it seems to have been deliberately positioned so as to hide the body from view. So I feel sure that there's some deeper significance to all of this.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I know what you mean.
Susato:
I've no doubt there are more clues to be uncovered. You're on the right track, I can feel it. So follow your instincts!
Ryunosuke:
...Alright, then.
Ryunosuke:
I'm afraid that's not necessarily the case.
Sandwich:
Oh...
Ryunosuke:
At the scene, we found this key to the winder of the inspector's pocket watch.
Kazuma:
A key...?
Ryunosuke:
And having wound the pocket watch, we discovered that it in fact still works. You see, the watch didn't stop because it was broken at all. And that fact... ...completely undermines one of the most fundamental premises on which this entire case has been built!
Kazuma:
What?!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! B-But Counsel... ...the watch was stopped at almost exactly five o'clock.
Venus:
Yeah, which is just when we 'eard that gunshot.
Gossip:
It is. Exactly the hour.
Ryunosuke:
The time that was showing on the watch tells us nothing other than when it wound down. It's merely a coincidence that it happened to be at five o'clock.
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
Even if that's true... ...the three witnesses here all heard the gunshot at five o'clock. So that's obviously when this crime was committed!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
No, that doesn't hold!
Kazuma:
Why not?
Ryunosuke:
Recall what Inspector Lestrade said only moments ago:
Gina:
The boss used to wind it up every evenin' wivout fail when 'e was waitin' for 'is grub to come at the pub. Said 'e 'adn't missed a day in the last ten years, polishin' it an' windin' it. It meant the world to 'im, that watch did.
Ryunosuke:
The victim was in the habit of winding his watch once a day...in the evening. We can reasonably assume, therefore, that he wound the timepiece on the evening before he died as well.
Judge:
Yes, that would be entirely reasonable.
Ryunosuke:
But if that's the case... ...you wouldn't expect the watch to have completely wound down by five o'clock the following day.
Gossip:
Oh! Aye...
Venus:
Well 'ow do you explain it then?!
Ryunosuke:
In summary, the evening before the day of the incident, when the gunshot rang out in that room... ...the inspector was already unable to wind his watch.
Kazuma:
You, you can't mean...
Ryunosuke:
What would stop a man winding his watch if he's been in the habit of winding it every single evening for ten years? The obvious answer...is that he was already dead!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Counsel, that is a most extraordinary claim!
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
Extraordinary isn't the word! It's absurd! You claim he was already dead the night before? Do you really think that Scotland Yard's coroner would have overlooked something like that?!
Ryunosuke:
Ah! W-Well, um...
Susato:
On that subject, there is something rather surprising... There's actually an omission in the coroner's report. The time of death is not noted.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! That's, that's right!
Gossip:
Wait a minute! You're forgetting that my legs went from under me when I kicked the door in.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Gossip:
Like I said, I planted my hand in a dirty great puddle of blood.
Kazuma:
Yes. So the victim's blood hadn't dried. It was fresh.
Gossip:
He catches on fast, dozn't he?
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But that blood could be explained in any number of ways! It could have been put there afterwards. Some fresh blood could have been poured over the victim's body after he-
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
Does my learned friend think that fresh blood is available on every street corner?
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Susato:
Well, it needn't necessarily have been human blood, of course.
Kazuma:
...!
Susato:
We've been told previously that Scotland Yard has no way to identify blood as human.
Judge:
The problem is currently being researched. At present, you are correct. It is beyond our abilities.
Ryunosuke:
So then...a chicken's blood could have been used, for example.
Susato:
It's certainly a possibility that it wasn't the inspector's blood at all.
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
But the gunshot was heard at five o'clock that afternoon. That's beyond question!
Ryunosuke:
Is it, though?
Kazuma:
What?!
Ryunosuke:
Given that the time of death of the victim has already been called into question... ...it isn't beyond the realms of possibility that what these witnesses heard wasn't a gunshot at all.
Venus:
Oh, please! What are you tryin' to say?
Gossip:
Uz lot know what we heard! And it woz a loud bang that came from that there room!
Sandwich:
Now y-you listen to me! A street seller's ears are his l-l-livelihood.
Ryunosuke:
I don't doubt your ears, sir. But all you can state with certainty is that you heard a noise.
Gossip:
Eh?
Judge:
Explain yourself then, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
A noise that sounds like a gunshot could have been made with...
Present Venus Firecracker (after examining fuse)
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Something like this. The culprit could have set off one of these to fake a gunshot."
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Well, the culprit could have used something like this, for example.
Judge:
Oh really? A demonstration is in order then, I feel.
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
Kazuma:
Yes, please, show the court how you could use that to create a noise like a gunshot.
Judge:
...We're waiting, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
......... I may have been mistaken.
Kazuma:
It looks like you've been making a lot of noise yourself... Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (Ugh...Kazuma's got a devastating way with words in English, too.)
Susato:
I realise it may be difficult to retract what you said and present some different evidence, but perhaps...
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, I was thinking the same thing myself.) That's because I'm convinced there is some evidence that could produce a similar noise!
Leads back to:
"Explain yourself then, Counsel."
Ryunosuke:
Something like this. The culprit could have set off one of these to fake a gunshot.
Judge:
Good gracious! The very fireworks that are sold by the witness?
Venus:
...Now 'old on a minute! Are you sayin' I did it?! My pretty little firecrackers only make a little pop anyway. See?
Ryunosuke:
Not a hundred of them together. The Venus Special that you sell for six hundred pennies sounds like this:
...*BANG!*
Ryunosuke:
As the court can now attest...it sounds very much like a gunshot in fact.
Venus:
Agh agh agh agh agh!
Kazuma:
You're trying to suggest that somebody set one of those fireworks off at the scene?
Ryunosuke:
I'm suggesting that somebody knew the defendant was in the room at five that day... ...and sought to implicate him by creating a sound like a gunshot for these pedlars on Fresno Street to hear!
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
But even the accused himself has testified that he saw no one else in the room at the time. Whether it was a gun or a firecracker, the only person present to cause that bang was Barok van Zieks!
Venus:
One whiff of a match and my firecrackers go pop. See? It's why people like 'em.
Judge:
I fear for your fingers, young lady.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Recently during my time here in Britain, I've learnt of a very useful invention indeed. Something called a, um...a time bomb.
Judge:
Good heavens! A bomb?!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, a device that allows you to blow up whatever you like, whenever you like.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo. I worry that your unfortunate phrasing there...may lead to yet another international incident.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! No no no! Wait! ...It's, it's the 'whenever you like' part that's important.
Kazuma:
A timed device?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! Exactly! A timed device! Something of that nature could have been planted at the scene. A device that was able to produce the sound of a gunshot long after the culprit had left.
Judge:
Your extravagant claim will have to be substantiated with evidence, Counsel. What proof do you have to suggest in any way that a timed device was employed to create the gunshot sound?
Present Candelabrum
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"As the court has already discussed, the tip of one of the candles in this candelabrum has been blown off."
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Judge:
You're suggesting this could have been used as some sort of 'time delay' device?
Ryunosuke:
I...did think so, My Lord. But it's becoming increasingly clear... ...that we've all been very misguided here.
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
Yes, by you.
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
Judge:
No, Counsel, the time has come for a penalty. Without delay.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...no time to clear the area before the blast...)
Leads back to:
"Your extravagant claim will have to be substantiated with evidence, Counsel."
Ryunosuke:
As the court has already discussed, the tip of one of the candles in this candelabrum has been blown off.
Judge:
Indeed. Because it was struck by the bullet, which presumably passed through the victim.
Ryunosuke:
I don't think that's possible, My Lord.
Kazuma:
Not possible? Why?
Ryunosuke:
Because of the scorching. There are gunpowder scorch marks clearly visible on the broken candle.
Judge:
There are? ...Goodness, yes! But is it not the case... ...that there was also scorching on the victim around the bullet entry wound?
Ryunosuke:
That's right, there was. But as we heard earlier... ...scorching like that only occurs when the target is at very close range - a matter of centimetres from the gun.
Judge:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
Which means that the scorching on the candle can't possibly be the result of a gunshot.
Kazuma:
You're suggesting it came from the fireworks?
Gossip:
How can that be, eh?
Ryunosuke:
The fact that there's such visible scorching on the candle... ...suggests that the fireworks must have been right next to it when they exploded. Or to put it another way...the candle and firecrackers were joined together.
The culprit somehow attached the firecrackers at a point partway down the candle. After the killer had left the scene... ...the candle slowly burnt down along with the other two... ...until eventually it ignited the fuse of the firecrackers generating a loud...
...*BANG!*
.........
Ryunosuke:
And that is how these three witnesses came to believe they'd heard a gunshot at five o'clock.
Judge:
......... Well...what a plot... And this implies that the victim could have died earlier than we've been led to believe. The previous day, even.
Gossip:
Now...now...now just hold your horses! All uz lot here saw the victim goin' into the building, remember?
Sandwich:
I, I couldn't forget that flame-coloured hair even if I w-wanted to.
Ryunosuke:
The person you saw entering the building wasn't the victim at all. ...Consider this.
Gossip:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
Obviously anybody can wear a wig. So the person that these witnesses saw entering the building fifteen minutes before the incident occurred... ...could easily have been someone else entirely wearing the red hairpiece.
Judge:
Someone else?! Do, do you mean to say...?
Ryunosuke:
It was the same person who contrived the firecracker trick. In other words...Inspector Gregson's killer!
???:
Pfft...
Examine evidence
Candelabrum
Scorch marks
Ryunosuke:
So the candle was used as a sort of timer device to set off the firecrackers... That's a really ingenious idea...though obviously it's a shame it was used for such a wicked purpose.
Susato:
I wonder if there aren't some more positive uses for a timer device such as that... Ah, I have the perfect application! It would be a wonderful way of waking you in the mornings, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
...I think I'd prefer that you continue to wake me in person, if it's all the same to you.
Kazuma:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha hah! Oh, very impressive, Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
K-Kazuma?!
Kazuma:
I'm really quite amazed you've come this far. But after all, wasn't I the one who told you... ...that you had all the makings of a great defence lawyer?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
I also noted the lack of a time of death in this report. A stark omission. But as far as I'm concerned...this whole country's justice system leaves a lot to be desired!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Prosecutor Asogi! What do you mean by that statement?
Kazuma:
I hear that many of the leading members of Britain's judiciary are present to observe this trial today. So we cannot allow even the slightest doubt to be overlooked.
Judge:
...!
Kazuma:
The defence's assertion about the time of death based on the victim's stopped watch is just conjecture. But...while the possibility exists that my learned friend may be correct...we have a duty to explore it.
Judge:
Hmmm... Well, certainly...I would agree with you.
Kazuma:
And what immediately comes to mind is of course... ...what was Inspector Gregson doing and where did he go on the day before the incident?
Ryunosuke:
Do you know?
Kazuma:
The inspector always carried out his investigative work alone. His movements were treated as confidential within Scotland Yard.
Judge:
Even within the Yard?
Kazuma:
However, considering the evidence we've been presented with so far... ...I'd say it's fairly apparent what case the man was pursuing. Wouldn't you, my learned friend?
Susato:
I do have a feeling about what case he might have been investigating.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I agree. Surely... My Lord! The defence believes it can explain to the court... ...the case that was being investigated by Inspector Gregson at the time of his death!
Judge:
Very well, Counsel. Present your argument to the court. What evidence is suggestive of the case being investigated by the inspector on the day prior to the incident?
Present Red-Headed League Article or Red Hairpiece
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"I believe this red hairpiece points to the answer."
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Judge:
Hm... I can't say that I find your answer suggestive of anything in particular. Other than perhaps that it is utterly wrong. That much you have clarified most expertly.
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
Kazuma:
Congratulations, Ryunosuke Naruhodo. You deserve a reward for that expert display!
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAARGH! (Did, did you just draw Karuma on me, my friend?)
Susato:
I think, Mr Naruhodo, that there's one particular piece of evidence... ...that really does stand out in showing what case Inspector Gregson was investigating.
Ryunosuke:
My Lord! I have the answer now!
Leads back to:
"Very well, Counsel."
Ryunosuke:
I believe this red hairpiece points to the answer.
Kazuma:
...!
Ryunosuke:
We might assume it was part of a disguise used to carry out an undercover investigation.
Judge:
Surely not! Such a brightly coloured hairpiece would only serve to make the inspector more noticeable.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's quite true. It would definitely have made him stand out in a crowd. Except, that is...in a crowd of gentlemen from the Red-Headed League.
Judge:
The, the Red-Headed League?
Kazuma:
So...you'd already worked it out.
Judge:
What on earth is this all about? Is there such an extraordinary league of gentlemen?
Kazuma:
The Red-Headed League is currently under investigation for a grand deception.
Judge:
A deception of what nature, Counsel?
Kazuma:
They've been targeting red-headed men across all of London and tricking them out of small sums of money. Two men were arrested for the misdemeanour only yesterday, in fact.
Ryunosuke:
My Lord! The defence calls for those two men to be summoned at once!
Judge:
T-Two red-heads?!
Ryunosuke:
Inspector Gregson clearly infiltrated the Red-Headed League using this hairpiece. So it's very likely that he had direct contact with these criminals. And it's quite possible that such contact led to...more serious events.
Kazuma:
.........
Judge:
I concur that we cannot in good conscience leave this new avenue unexplored.
Susato:
Well done, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Well...it's another possible line of enquiry for us at least.
Judge:
The prosecution will make immediate arrangements for the charged men to appear. Bring these two Red-Headed League conspirators before me, Prosecutor Asogi!
Kazuma:
At once, My Lord.
Judge:
Very good. We will have a thirty-minute recess. Court is adjourned!
To be continued...
2nd November, 12:33 p.m.
The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber
Gina:
Oh, there you are, 'Oddo!
Sholmes:
What kept you, my dear fellow?
Ryunosuke:
Hello, Mr Sholmes. Gina.
Gina:
You sure about wot you said in there? That the boss...you know...actually died the day before? It's pretty 'ard to swallow.
Susato:
Yes, I was shocked by the revelation too, Gina.
Sholmes:
As was I! Possibly more shocked than both of you!
Ryunosuke:
...It's not a competition, Mr Sholmes. (But I was more shocked than all of you put together.)
Sholmes:
This is the autopsy report in question, is it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It's strange that there's no time of death noted. I suppose there's a simple explanation. Or perhaps...it was a deliberate omission.
Susato:
Oh dear... If it was deliberate... ...it puts me in mind of the last case we worked on...and Dr Sithe.
Ryunosuke:
I know. Anyway, it seems that on the day before Lord van Zieks discovered his body... ...Inspector Gregson was investigating the Red-Headed League. So perhaps something happened with them. Come to think of it... ...you had trouble with those league men too, didn't you, Mr Sholmes? You were taken in by their trick.
Sholmes:
No no no! Naturally, I wasn't 'taken in' as you put it. My sleuth-hound interest was merely piqued slightly by the rare scent of a weekly four-pound income.
Ryunosuke:
...And that scent masked the underlying scent of deception, I suppose.
Susato:
The two criminals in question are the pair we saw being arrested yesterday, aren't they? In Mr Sholmes's suite, I mean.
Gina:
That's right, Sooze! An' it was me wot took 'em in! Thanks to a tip-off by a good, law-abidin' citizen.
Sholmes:
Indeed. Yours truly.
Ryunosuke:
(So it's going to be that pair in the witness stand next, is it?) Something doesn't quite make sense to me, though. The day before Inspector Gregson was found, you hadn't had trouble with the Red-Headed League yet, had you? Why would the inspector have been investigating them?
Sholmes:
Well, the likely explanation would be... ...that Gregson's own sleuth-hound interest was piqued by the rare scent of a weekly four-pound income.
Gina:
Don't tar 'im wiv the same brush as you, Sholmes!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, well... Then there's the whole issue of Inspector Gregson being investigated by Lord van Zieks for some reason.
Susato:
The Reaper...the Red-Headed League... Inspector Gregson...Lord van Zieks...
Ryunosuke:
...And Kazuma.
Susato:
...!
Ryunosuke:
I feel as though he knew we'd arrive at this point somehow.
Susato:
Gosh! I, I think you're right...
Ryunosuke:
(What's he really trying to achieve here today?)
Sholmes:
All the answers will soon be revealed. ...Observe the time, my dear fellow. This recess will be over very shortly.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, you're right. (Kazuma was determined that he should be the one to prosecute this trial. And he was determined that I should take the defence. Just what is it that he's hoping to make me see, I wonder? I get the feeling we're a long way from the end of this trial yet...) Are you ready then, Miss Susato?
Susato:
Yes!
2nd November, 1:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again. We resume the closed court hearing of Barok van Zieks, here present, who stands accused of murder. Now then, Prosecutor Asogi...
Kazuma:
My Lord?
Judge:
Have you summoned the witnesses as requested?
Kazuma:
Yes. The two members of the Red-Headed League who planned and carried out the deception. They arrived not long ago from the local prison by police carriage.
Judge:
Very good. Bailiff, usher the two men into the courtroom!
Kazuma:
These two men are currently being held by the police on suspicion of attempted extortion. You may omit your occupations. But please state your names now for the court.
De Rousseau:
I am Fabien de Rousseau. A descendant of ze great de Rousseau family from Nice, en France.
De Rossi:
And my-a name is Peppino de Rossi! I am the third son of the great familia de Rossi - the landowners from Napoli!
Kazuma:
The two men first became acquainted at a boarding school for European nobility.
De Rousseau:
Zose who graduate from Temsik are ze future leaders of Europe. ...But! Do you 'ave any idea 'ow boring it is to be born wiz noble blood? ...Alors! I make it my mission to get ze better of ze world by employing ze little grey cells of my brain. Zat is all I am trying to do, uh.
Ryunosuke:
So...that's the only reason for this whole grand deception you've been carrying out?
De Rousseau:
...Oui. You could say zat.
De Rossi:
Not bad, ay? He has the grand ideals, but the petty plans! This strange combination is-a the charm of the Hairlarious Brothers! Si, capo?
De Rousseau:
......... Listen to me, Peppino. I 'ave two sings to say to you:
De Rossi:
Eh? Che? Are you about to tell me one of your grandi anecdotes? Evviva!
De Rousseau:
Firstly, I want you to stop calling me zis 'capo'. And secondly... ..we are not ze 'Airlarious Brothers. Zis is serious business.
De Rossi:
Che bello! There it is! The capo's trump-a card: the furrowed brow! It is deep, uh, capo? The furrow, and the meaning of your words!
Judge:
The court has been led to believe that under the banner of the 'Red-Headed League'... ...you have conspired to swindle money from unsuspecting members of the public. Is this true?
De Rousseau:
Oui. C'est ça.
Judge:
And what exactly was the nature of this deception by which you planned to defraud?
De Rousseau:
...Alors, I will explain it.
De Rossi:
No, capo! Leave it to-a me! As you see, we both have the vivid red hair, no? At school, we were teased for this without pity. The capo here, he was many times behind the schoolhouse, crying like the Trevi Fountain. 'Uèèè! Zose dogs! One day ze world will respect us red-'eads!' Every night, he would bury his-a head in his-a pillow and weep for the injustice.
De Rousseau:
C'est bien, Peppino! Enough! I will explain ze rest. Ze first step was ze newspaper advertisement. About one week before ze plan was put into operation, we listed ze same notice in every paper in London.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, we saw that notice. It was this one, I believe. Entitled 'To the Red-Headed League'.
De Rousseau:
Oui. C'est ça. I am honoured zat you 'ave seen it.
Ryunosuke:
It states that the only condition for joining the league is having flame-coloured hair. And that if you satisfy the interview panel and are admitted into the league... ...you could receive a weekly income of four pounds.
Kazuma:
On the date specified, red-headed hopefuls gathered in droves at a park specified in the advertisement. And from each person present, this pair took an application fee of five shillings.
De Rousseau:
And wiz ze money, to France! It was a plan most elegant, non?
Kazuma:
No, it was most dishonourable. But to be frank, I'm stunned anybody was foolish enough to be taken in by such an obvious trick.
Susato:
The park was described by one witness as 'choked with red-headed folk, like a coster's orange barrow'.
Kazuma:
And the day on which all these men gathered to apply was the day before the victim was discovered. Crucially, these two men spoke face to face with every single person present that day.
De Rousseau:
Oui. I 'ave seen more red-'eaded people in one day zan I will see in ze rest of my life.
De Rossi:
Si, si. And-a now, every time I see the capo's hair, I feel sick to my stomach!
De Rousseau:
Anyway, why 'ave we been summoned 'ere today?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
De Rousseau:
Ze date for our trial was not until tomorrow, I was told.
Kazuma:
Naturally, neither of these men have been told any details about this trial. They've only been shown this photograph.
Judge:
Very good. So, Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi, you will now give your formal testimony for the court... ...on the subject of the gentleman pictured in this photograph.
De Rousseau:
Of course. We are always ready to 'elp wiz ze law.
Witness Testimony
- The Man in the Photograph -
De Rousseau:
We 'ad more zan one thousand red-'eaded people assemble in ze park on Lime Street zat day.
De Rossi:
But I don't recall the man in this-a photograph. Ay, capo?
De Rousseau:
Non, I don't remember 'im. Obviously 'e is dead now. But I assure you, 'e was not in ze park.
De Rossi:
Allora! This victim is-a nothing to do with us!
De Rousseau:
You 'ave a lot to answer for, Peppino. It is your fault zat we got caught in ze first place.
Kazuma:
You've given sworn testimony that this man in the photograph was not present. Can you be certain?
De Rousseau:
Oui, oui. I am quite certain. We did not interview zis man.
De Rossi:
Nobody looking like-a this came to the park. This, I can promise!
Judge:
It must be noted that you have been arrested for a grand deception, however. Accordingly, this court has little confidence in your assurances.
De Rossi:
...!  ...Uffa! With this attitude, we get-a nowhere, uh?
Ryunosuke:
(He's really-a sulking now...)
Kazuma:
This confidential document was obtained directly from Scotland Yard. It records an entry from the inspector's private diary dated the day before the incident. It reads, 'Lime Street, Red-Headed League, Undercover.'
De Rossi:
Ah! I have the answer! Maybe there was another, similar event in the park on the day in question, ay?
De Rousseau:
Zat is ridiculous.
Ryunosuke:
(There's no question that Inspector Gregson was investigating the Red-Headed League. Which means it's quite possible that's when he was killed!)
Judge:
Very well. The defence may proceed with the cross-examination now.
Ryunosuke:
Ah. Yes, My Lord!
Cross-Examination
- The Man in the Photograph -
De Rousseau:
We 'ad more zan one thousand red-'eaded people assemble in ze park on Lime Street zat day.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
A thousand people? That's a very big crowd.
De Rousseau:
It was quite a spectacle. Red-'eads 'ad come from all over ze capital.
De Rossi:
Si, the capo here, he has the magnetismo animale, ay? Nobody else could attract-a so many people. If I could be born again, I would be the capo!
De Rousseau:
All zose people wanted was ze money, Peppino. Ze four pounds per week.
Judge:
Are you suggesting that you spoke personally with all one thousand applicants?
De Rousseau:
Oui, oui, zat we did. Because every one of zem paid us five shillings.
De Rossi:
We take-a their names and we take-a their money! And we take-a their addresses as well. Then I tell them we take-a some days to let them know by-a post, e finito! Maybe...two minuti a person? We start early in the morning, and we stop late in the night.
Ryunosuke:
So...you earnt five thousand shillings in one day?! (That's a small fortune!)
Kazuma:
Who'd have thought there were a thousand such gullible red-heads in London to start with.
Ryunosuke:
(One of whom was a great detective with chemically altered hair...)
De Rossi:
But I don't recall the man in this-a photograph. Ay, capo?
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
He doesn't look at all familiar?
De Rossi:
No, I don't-a think so. And this is a wig, ay? He was trying to trick us! I do not like the people who are trying to trick the other people!
Ryunosuke:
...Says the con artist.
Kazuma:
If between them they interviewed a thousand people with red hair... ...it would be unreasonable to expect them to remember every face.
De Rossi:
No no, signore. I may be small... ...but my memory is very large! I never forget a thing! In my opinion, I do not think this-a man was in the park.
Ryunosuke:
(But he's not going to give the court a definite, it seems.)
De Rossi:
Eh, capo? You didn't see a man like this, uh?
De Rousseau:
Non, I don't remember 'im. Obviously 'e is dead now. But I assure you, 'e was not in ze park.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
But according to what you've said, you spoke with a thousand or more people that day.
De Rousseau:
Oui, zat's true. My eyes were burning by ze end of ze day.
Ryunosuke:
Surely then, you can't actually remember every single face. How are you so certain... ...that this particular man wasn't present?
De Rossi:
Normally, the red hair is very distinctive, ay? But not when you have one thousand red-heads crowding around. Then it is just an eyesore! But if there was some other information you could-a give us, maybe then we would recall.
De Rousseau:
Zat is not ze line, Peppino. Remember, we do not remember 'im. We are sure of zat fact, uh? If zere was a man wiz a red 'airpiece, but 'is moustache did not match ze colour... ...zen I do not sink I could 'ave forgotten 'im.
Ryunosuke:
(Kazuma said these two had only been shown that photograph and they'd been told nothing else at all. But what if I fed them just one other detail about the victim. For example...)
His name
Ryunosuke:
I can certainly appreciate that just knowing the man had red hair wouldn't help you remember in this situation. But what if I told you that the man's name was Gregson?
De Rousseau:
Ze man in ze photograph is a Monsieur Gregson?
Ryunosuke:
Yes.
De Rossi:
Names, they are boring! I did not-a listen to any of them.
Ryunosuke:
...Oh.
De Rossi:
It was not a real interview, uh? It was just for-a show. Why would I remember the names?
De Rousseau:
Zat's right. Zis changes nothing. Ze man in ze photograph was not zere. As we 'ave already said.
Ryunosuke:
I see...
Judge:
Hm... It seems there's little to be gained from pursuing this point further.
De Rousseau:
Tell zem again what you said before, Peppino.
De Rossi:
Si, capo, si! I say it again and again!
Leads back to cross-examination
His profession
Ryunosuke:
I can certainly appreciate that just knowing the man had red hair wouldn't help you remember in this situation. But what if I told you the man in the red hairpiece was actually a detective?
De Rousseau:
Ze man in ze photograph? A detective?
Ryunosuke:
Yes.
Kazuma:
It would appear he found your notice in the paper suspicious and decided to investigate incognito.
De Rousseau:
......... ...Sorry, but zis changes nothing. No detective came to ze park. I am certain of zat.
Pursue Peppino de Rossi (before Inspector's Identification is added to the Court Record)
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Something to add, Mr de Rossi?!
De Rossi:
......... Che? Si, I am always adding something! Parmesan, olive oil, pepper...
Ryunosuke:
What I mean is...did you not agree with your friend's last remark by any chance?
De Rossi:
Eh? What-a did he just-a say? About the detective?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that.
De Rousseau:
Keep your mouth shut, Peppino! You 'ave said enough already.
De Rossi:
But-a why, capo? What is the problem? There was a man who said-a, 'I am an inspector from Scotland Yard.'
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Kazuma:
...!
Judge:
Good Lord! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Explain this volte-face in your testimony, witness!
De Rossi:
Is simple. A man who was at-a the park said to us that he was an inspect-
De Rousseau:
Zere was no such man.
De Rossi:
Ma dai! What are you saying, capo? Have you forgotten, ay?
De Rousseau:
I 'ave forgotten nothing. Nobody like zis came to ze park.
De Rossi:
Basta, capo, basta! You beat me at-a many things, but not two: the memory and the meals! Like I said, when is time to eat-a the pasta, no one is-a faster!
De Rousseau:
But you are inferior to me in every other way... so shut up!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
.........
Kazuma:
.........
De Rousseau:
Uuurgh... Trop tard... Ze damage is done...
Judge:
Indeed it is, sir.
De Rousseau:
Oui, zere was a man who came to ze park and 'e said 'e was an inspector from Scotland Yard. 'Owever! 'E looked nothing like ze man in ze photograph. 'E was someone else!
Ryunosuke:
How can you be so sure?
De Rousseau:
Because! To start wiz, 'is face was completely different.
De Rossi:
Si...is true, is true. The man who came was-a younger. His-a face was clean-shaven. His-a eyes were sadder. His-a chin was thinner.
Judge:
No resemblance whatsoever, then!
De Rousseau:
Anyway, I was not going to be fooled. I took ze obvious precaution and said to 'im... ...'If you are really a detective, show us ze proof!'
De Rossi:
Si, si, the capo here, he doesn't take-a no nonsense, ay?
De Rousseau:
But 'e was well prepared. 'E said 'e 'ad identification.
Ryunosuke:
I-Identification? You mean, official police inspector's identification?
Judge:
That is most unconvincing.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry, My Lord?
Judge:
Counsel, no incognito inspector would offer his identification for inspection. It's quite out of the question.
Kazuma:
Definitely. Why would he expose his true identity?
De Rousseau:
Clearly ze papers were fake.
De Rossi:
Certo, capo! You are a genius! As we say in-a Italia, it takes a thief to recognise another, ay?
Ryunosuke:
And what happened after he announced that he was a detective?
De Rousseau:
'E became very annoying. 'E said, 'You are under investigation.' So I took 'is papers from 'im and chased 'im out of ze park.
De Rossi:
It was fantastico! And look, here is-a the identification!
Kazuma:
So you stole it from the man?
De Rossi:
He had it-a coming! He made us very scared. But he was-a not who he said-a he was!
Judge:
Indeed, the person described does not appear to have behaved as a true inspector would. However, I believe it would be prudent for these identification papers to be entered into evidence.
De Rossi:
Hmph. But I-a like them!
The inspector's identification has been entered into the Court Record.
Judge:
Now, let us return to the witnesses' testimony.
Leads back to cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
I see...
De Rousseau:
In any case, if such a man 'ad come incognito... ...'e wouldn't 'ave just said, 'I am a detective,' would 'e?
Ryunosuke:
Well...no, I suppose not.
Judge:
Hm...sound logic, I must agree.
Kazuma:
.........
De Rousseau:
Tell zem again what you said before, Peppino.
De Rossi:
Ay? Ah! Si, capo, si! Is-a best we move on!
Leads back to cross-examination
His fish and chips
Ryunosuke:
I can certainly appreciate that just knowing the man had red hair wouldn't help you remember in this situation. But what if I told you the man was always munching on a packet of fish and chips? Do you remember a man who was eating incessantly?
De Rousseau:
Not really. I was looking only at ze 'eads of ze applicants. I wouldn't 'ave noticed ze fish and chips any more zan ze caviar and smoked salmon.
De Rossi:
Or-a spaghetti! Me, I love the spaghetti!
Ryunosuke:
Really? I had no idea...
De Rousseau:
Tell zem again what you said before, Peppino.
De Rossi:
Si, capo, si! I say it again and again!
Leads back to cross-examination
Examine evidence
Inspector's Identification
Latch on back
Ryunosuke:
Well, I suppose we should see what this inspector's identification looks like inside...
Writing inside
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it definitely looks fake, doesn't it?
Susato:
Out of interest, what name is given?
Ryunosuke:
Probably just something plucked out of the air. It's...'Tobias Gregson'... Wait, what?
Susato:
......... This Scotland Yard insignia... ...looks genuine to me.
Ryunosuke:
But how?!
Susato:
And the department and identification number details are all correct as well.
Ryunosuke:
(Since when have you known those?) Do, do you mean to say...?
Susato:
I know it seems incredible, but yes... ...I think this is a genuine identification book issued by Scotland Yard.
Ryunosuke:
But that's... That's unbelievable! (This is the real thing after all?!)
The details of the inspector's identification have been updated in the Court Record.
Writing inside (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
This Scotland Yard insignia looks genuine to me.
Susato:
And the department and identification number details are all correct as well. There's no doubt that this really is Inspector Gregson's identification.
De Rossi:
Allora! This victim is-a nothing to do with us!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
But we only have your word for that.
De Rossi:
Si, but what else can we do, uh?
Ryunosuke:
(True...)
De Rossi:
Uffa! We are not having much-a fun these days! First we are arrested, then we are shown the horrible picture of a dead man... ...and now you question every single-a thing we say! WE are the victims here! Ay, capo?
Ryunosuke:
No, you were caught carrying out a plot to swindle hundreds of innocent people.
De Rossi:
...! Hmph! You had to bring that up, ay? It's not fair! Ay, capo?
Present Inspector's Identification (after examining writing inside)
Ryunosuke:

De Rousseau:
You 'ave a lot to answer for, Peppino. It is your fault zat we got caught in ze first place.

Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean by that?
De Rossi:
Cavolo! You promised not to say! Ay, capo?
De Rousseau:
After we 'ad taken all ze money zat day, we should 'ave left ze country. Zat was my plan. I left ze purchasing of ze tickets for ze ferry to Dunkerque to my companion 'ere. But 'e bought zem for ze wrong day.
Ryunosuke:
Oops.
De Rossi:
Si, but is an easy mistake-a to make-a, uh? The first, the thirty-first...
De Rousseau:
Bof! I 'ave no sympathy for you! We were an 'ole day late for ze boat because of your stupidity! And it's only because of zis, zat ze so-called 'great red-'eaded detective' caught us!
De Rossi:
Capo...you know what I think? This is the work of God! Is a holy punishment, ay?
De Rousseau:
Peppino, for ze last time... ...zis is not 'oly punishment. Zis is 'olly your fault!
De Rossi:
Ah!
De Rousseau:
Don't blame God for your unholy mistakes. You are makin' me sick wiz anger!
De Rossi:
Hmph. Maybe I make-a mistake-a. But when is time to eat-a the pasta, no one is-a faster!
Ryunosuke:
(And I've seen the evidence...)
Ryunosuke:
(They haven't told us much we didn't already know...)
Susato:
What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Well, if it was in the inspector's diary, it seems likely that he must have gone to Lime Street that day. And yet these two both claim they didn't see him...
Susato:
I have to say... ...they don't appear to be telling lies.
Ryunosuke:
Well, they are experts in deception, don't forget. Sounding plausible is their specialty. They may be lying simply to avoid being implicated in this case as well.
Susato:
Surely if they were truly experts in deception, they wouldn't have been caught.
Ryunosuke:
(Well, yes, you do have a point there...) ...It seems to me like we need more information.
Susato:
Definitely!
Ryunosuke:
I wonder if I could ask you to examine this identification book very closely... ...Miss Lestrade?
Kazuma:
Why Miss Lestrade?
Judge:
What is your intention here, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Is this really a fake, or is it genuine? That's the question. ...Which we can't answer ourselves.
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
Don't be ridiculous. No Scotland Yard detective would allow his - or her - identification to be stolen.
???:
Hold it!
Gina:
That...that... That IS the boss's! ...No question about it.
Kazuma:
It can't be!
Ryunosuke:
As I suspected. The 'undercover detective' who attended the Red-Headed League's enrolment on the day in question... ...was the real Inspector Gregson carrying out an incognito investigation!
De Rousseau:
Zu... Zut aloooooors!
Judge:
O-Ordaaar! Ordaaar!
Gina:
But...if the boss 'ad 'is identification stolen... ...'e would've reported it straight away. I mean, 'e was always on at me about it. If ya lose summat, report it at once, 'e'd say.
Ryunosuke:
Could it be, then... ...that the inspector was physically unable to report it?
De Rossi:
Physically... Ay?! What are you-a saying?
Kazuma:
Unable to...? You're, you're not suggesting...?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! It's quite possible that he was killed before he had the chance to report his identification stolen!
Kazuma:
No!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!
Ryunosuke:
The defence posits that the victim was killed the day before his body was discovered, at a different location. Do you two...have anything to say about that?!
De Rossi:
Uèèèèèèèèèèèè! I know-a nothing! Uèèèèèèèèè! I done-a nothing! Uèèèèèèèèè!
De Rousseau:
Pull yourself together, Peppino! Mon Dieu! You can behave a little more like a master criminal zan zat, non?
De Rossi:
Uèèèèèèèèè! Now I wish I had-a returned to Italia! Uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè!
De Rousseau:
S-Stop crying, Peppino, please! Otherwise I...I...
Gina:
Lumme! Stop yer whinin' an' start talkin'!
Judge:
Well...I believe the court will need to hear your story in considerably greater detail.
De Rossi:
I know-a nothing! Uèèèèèèèèè! I done-a nothing! Uèèèèèèèèè!
Kazuma:
But you will tell everything! ...Or face the worst possible outcome.
De Rousseau:
Ugh... Uuuuuugh...

Witness Testimony

De Rousseau:
Ze, ze truth is, we took 'im prisoner and kept 'im for ze night at our secret 'ideout.
Even though I didn't sink 'e was a real detective, I, I was too scared to let 'im go zat day, just in case.
De Rossi:
We took the man's identification from him and shut-a him in the room next to ours!
De Rousseau:
Zere might 'ave been a little tussle, but we did 'im no 'arm. And ze next mornin', we let 'im go.
De Rossi:
He spent-a the night in a nice room! It was-a nothing like prison really! Uèèèèèè!
Judge:
This, this is outrageous! You imprisoned the man?!
De Rossi:
But! No! Si! No! It, it was not-a like a prison! He was-a very comfortable and-a calm and-a happy! Ay, capo?
De Rousseau:
......... It, it was never part of my plan! I swear it!
De Rossi:
Uffa! So...so you think it was-a my fault, ay? Just because I got the date of the ferry wrong... by one-a little-a day!
De Rousseau:
I do not sink it was your fault, Peppino. I know it!
De Rossi:
No no no no! Per favore, capo. Is not-a fair.
Judge:
You shall have plenty of time for squabbling back at the prison, gentlemen.
De Rousseau:
Uff! I don't believe zis... 'Ow could 'e 'ave been a real detective...?
Judge:
Counsel for the Defence, proceed with the cross-examination!

Ryunosuke:

Ryunosuke:
Do, do you realise what you're saying?!
De Rousseau:
You 'ave to believe me! I never intended for zat to 'appen. And I'm sure ze detective did not intend it, either.
Ryunosuke:
...Do you think?
De Rousseau:
But, but zere was nothing else I could do!
De Rossi:
Si! Nothing else! This was-a the first crime for the capo! He was at the end of his-a wits!
De Rousseau:
I 'ave told you before, Peppino. Zat is not ze way to describe a criminal mastermind!
Kazuma:
What about this hideout of yours?
De Rousseau:
...An old, empty 'ouse behind ze park on Lime Street.
De Rossi:
We rented the place for-a two days. It was an inspired idea by the capo here.
Judge:
An impulsive idea, I would say.
De Rossi:
No no no! Not impulsive! Inspired! Ay, capo?
De Rousseau:
What am I supposed to say to zat, uh, Peppino?
Ryunosuke:
And it was in the house described that you confined Inspector Gregson, was it?
De Rousseau:
Ugh...oui. But you 'ave to remember: I was under ze impression zat 'e was a pretender. Not a real inspector!
Ryunosuke:
That doesn't quite add up, though. If you didn't think the man was a real inspector... ...there would have been no reason to take him prisoner, would there?
De Rousseau:
Non, you are right. But we couldn't be completely certain.
De Rousseau:
Even though I didn't sink 'e was a real detective, I, I was too scared to let 'im go zat day, just in case.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Too scared? Why?
De Rousseau:
Because! Why 'ad 'e come to ze park? We didn't know. Zere was a chance zat 'e 'ad seen through my plan.
De Rossi:
And if that was-a the case, he would go straight to the police station to blow-a the whistle on us! Even if he was just-a feigning to be an inspector, he was up to no good, uh? Without-a doubt-a.
Kazuma:
I think most people would agree that it's you two who were up to no good.
De Rossi:
Well-a...si, you may be right. Ay, capo?
De Rousseau:
Ze point is, we were not able to escape from England immediately. Zat is why we 'ad no choice but to take ze man prisoner.
Ryunosuke:
What I don't understand is why the inspector felt the need to show you his identification in the first place.
De Rossi:
Si! I ask myself the same question!
De Rousseau:
We were writing down ze names and addresses of all ze people who we took five shillings from zat day. I have forgotten what name 'e said, but ze address, it startled me.
De Rossi:
Si si! 'Address: Scotland Yard, Homicide Division,' he said!
Ryunosuke:
What?!
De Rousseau:
'E probably didn't like your face, Peppino. Anyway, I was not rude. I just politely asked 'im why 'e 'ad said it... ...and zat's when 'e started to say 'e was an inspector. Not long afterwards, 'e took out 'is identification.
Ryunosuke:
(What was Inspector Gregson playing at?)
Kazuma:
Tell the court what happened next. You took him back to your hideout, you say?
De Rossi:
Si! We did-a, we did-a!
De Rossi:
We took the man's identification from him and shut-a him in the room next to ours!

Ryunosuke:

De Rossi:
Si! That is-a the one!
Judge:
What made you believe that it was a forgery?
De Rossi:
I never seen a real one, of course. But he was so suspicious, this-a man. Allora, I was-a thinking, it must be false! Ay, capo?
De Rousseau:
Oui, it is just as Peppino said. We were convinced it was not genuine.
De Rossi:
And so together, the Hairlarious Brothers, we took-a the man captive!
De Rousseau:
All we did was shove 'im inside a locked room. Zen we made preparations to transport all of ze money.
Judge:
Hmm...
Ryunosuke:
In for a penny, in for a pound...
De Rousseau:
Zere might 'ave been a little tussle, but we did 'im no 'arm. And ze next mornin', we let 'im go.

Ryunosuke:

Ryunosuke:
Um...what do you mean by 'a little tussle' exactly?
De Rousseau:
Hm? Bof! It was nothing. Just a minor incident.
De Rossi:
The falso inspector, he was a real piece of-a the work! Ay, capo?
Ryunosuke:
What happened?
De Rossi:
Uffa! It was a disaster! We give him a nice room, and what does he-a do, uh? In the middle of the night, he tries to escape-a through the ventilatore!
Ryunosuke:
...Can you blame him?
De Rousseau:
We chased 'im, bien sûr. And we caught 'im again.
De Rossi:
...Can you-a blame us?
Ryunosuke:
......... Wait! You, you didn't... ...shoot the man in your haste, did you?
De Rousseau:
Zut! Who do you sink we are?! Of course not! I simply caught 'old of 'im again and took 'im back to ze room. Zere was really nothing more to it zan zat.
Pursue Peppino de Rossi
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Mr de Rossi! Is something wrong?
De Rossi:
Ay?! Me?
Ryunosuke:
Something Mr de Rousseau just said seemed to make you, um... Well, it seemed to make you act even more strangely than usual. What was that all about?
De Rossi:
Cavolo! At times like that, you don't-a wanna have the capo after you, believe me! And I speak-a from personal-a esperienza!
Ryunosuke:
Personal experience?
De Rousseau:
Zat is enough, Peppino. Zere is no need to say more.
De Rossi:
The truth is, the night-a before we put the Red-Headed League plan into action, I was-a scared. It was not-a fair to the capo, but...I tried to run away.
Ryunosuke:
It's a shame you didn't manage it.
De Rossi:
But the capo here, he came after me like-a the turbine, uh? And he dragged me back to the house, kicking and-a screaming. I still have-a the bruises to prove it! Ay, capo?
Judge:
Bruises, you say?
De Rossi:
Ah...you wanna see, uh? You wanna see my-a fantastico bruises!
De Rousseau:
Zat's enough now, Peppino. No one wants to look at any part of you.
De Rossi:
What-a to do, uh? I-a show you, or I-a don't...? I-a show you, or I-a don't...?
Kazuma:
You do! NOW!
De Rossi:
Allora, if everybody wants to see, then I-a do it! Ecco! You see? Is still very-a visible, ay?
Ryunosuke:
That, that red ring around your neck? You got that when you were dragged back to the house?
De Rossi:
Si! The capo, sometimes he is-a very rough! And-
De Rousseau:
I said zat's enough! Peppino's neck is nothing to do wiz what we are talking about 'ere. You 'ave my word.
Judge:
Hm, yes... What is your opinion, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
(About this red ring around Mr de Rossi's neck? I wonder... Does it matter?)
It's important
Ryunosuke:
Mr de Rossi! I'm going to have to ask you... ...to amend your testimony with details about that mark on your neck!
De Rossi:
Ay, capo? You see? Everyone is interested in what I say, uh?
De Rousseau:
Uuugh...
Judge:
Very well. You will amend you [sic] testimony as requested, Mr de Rossi.
De Rossi:
Si si, if you really want-a to know!
Changes statement from "Zere might 'ave been a little tussle, but we did 'im no 'arm. And ze next mornin', we let 'im go." to "He tried to escape, but the capo put-a the collare on him and dragged him back...like what he did-a to me, see?"
Wait and see
Ryunosuke:
(I don't suppose there's any cause for alarm. I'm sure it'll heal up in time.)
Susato:
I'm not quite sure that's what His Lordship meant, Mr Naruhodo.
De Rossi:
So! If you have-a seen enough, then I go back to what I was-a saying before.
Leads back to cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
And the following morning, you let him go, you say?
De Rousseau:
Correct! And it was an amicable parting. Zere was no trouble.
De Rossi:
Si si. We shake-a the hands and say let's-a do it again, uh!
Ryunosuke:
(Not a whiff of perjury here...)
De Rossi:
He tried to escape, but the capo put-a the collare on him and dragged him back...like what he did-a to me, see?

Ryunosuke:

Ryunosuke:
Are, are you saying that red mark was caused by...
De Rossi:
Si si! A big collare made from-a the leather!
Ryunosuke:
A leather collar...
Kazuma:
Is this true, Mr de Rousseau?
De Rousseau:
What? We 'ad a St Bernard at 'ome when I was younger. It is a souvenir from zat time, wiz a very strong chain.
Kazuma:
A strong chain?
Ryunosuke:
And you put that around your friend's neck?
De Rousseau:
I'm sorry! I was so angry zat 'e was leaving me alone.
De Rossi:
You did not have to tie the chain to the leg-a of the bed-a, though, uh? I would not have tried to run again.
Ryunosuke:
You...you didn't do that to Inspector Gregson as well, did you?
De Rossi:
'Treat-a the people-a equal-a!' Is the capo here's motto, ay?
Kazuma:
It's starting to sound a lot more like a prison all of a sudden.
De Rossi:
The capo is-a tough! But the capo is-a rough!
De Rousseau:
Uuugh... I, I shouldn't 'ave done it...
Ryunosuke:
So...the following morning when you released the inspector...
De Rossi:
He had-a the red ring around his neck just like-a me!
De Rousseau:
Peppino, s'il vous plaît... Leave it now.
De Rossi:
Now you know, uh? The capo here, you don't-a wanna tangle with him, ay? But for the inspector, is not so bad...

"So the day before his body was discovered, Inspector Gregson was taken prisoner while working incognito..."
De Rossi:
He spent-a the night in a nice room! It was-a nothing like prison really! Uèèèèèè!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You took away the man's freedom! However comfortable you make it sound, you were still holding him prisoner.
De Rossi:
If you say-a that, then I say-a this: There is something that takes away our freedom too. The lack of-a money! So we are the prisoners as well, uh? All of us!
Ryunosuke:
Huh?
De Rossi:
No money, no freedom. This is the truth! It-a makes me mad! And it-a makes me sad! What can-a we do?
Ryunosuke:
Um...well...
Kazuma:
If you feel so disenfranchised, take 'money' to court. ...Though it'll cost you, of course.
De Rossi:
Uffa, there you-a have it! You see? That is why we need the Red-Headed League, to fight for the justice!
Ryunosuke:
(Hm...perhaps he has a point.)
Susato:
No, Mr Naruhodo.
De Rossi:
All we did-a was to give the man a comfortable place to sleep for the night. And you say it was a prison, uh? UH?!
Ryunosuke:
(Hm...perhaps he has a point again.)
Susato:
No again, Mr Naruhodo.
De Rossi:
You should have heard him-a snoring! Ma dai! If anyone was disturbed, it was us!
Ryunosuke:
(Not much to go on, really...)
Susato:
Their testimony does make me wonder, you know. About this pocket watch belonging to the inspector, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
(Ah yes, the one he treasured so much, apparently.)
Susato:
If he was confined but not restrained, as the witnesses are implying... ...he would still have been able to wind his watch.
Ryunosuke:
That's very true, yes. (So did Inspector Gregson actually die while he was being held captive by these red-heads?)
Susato:
In which case, is it possible that these two young men are responsible for Inspector Gregson's...?
Ryunosuke:
To be honest...I find that hard to believe. Perhaps we should try to find out exactly what happened.
Susato:
Very wise, Mr Naruhodo, yes.
Ryunosuke:
So the day before his body was discovered, Inspector Gregson was taken prisoner while working incognito...
De Rousseau:
Non non! It was not like zat! It was 'ardly a prison. It was an...invitation to stay. It was 'omely.
Ryunosuke:
However you describe it, there's one glaring inconsistency that remains.
Judge:
What inconsistency is this, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
I would ask the court to look closely at this photograph of the victim, Inspector Gregson. You will see...that there is no red ring visible around his neck!
De Rossi:
Eh?! But, but that-a makes no sense! It was me who took-a the collare off the man in the morning. And I saw the red bruises on his-a neck, just like I have!
Ryunosuke:
Given that the mark is still clearly visible on this witness's neck... ...we'd expect to see bruising on the victim, who put in the collar more recently than Mr de Rossi!
Judge:
I-Indeed! That is most peculiar...
De Rossi:
But what we-a tell you, uh? Uh? We say this...from-a the beginning... Many times! Uèèèèèèèèèèèè!
De Rousseau:
Oui, Peppino is right. Ze man in ze photograph... ...'e is someone different to ze man we 'eld captive zat niiiiiiiiight!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!
Kazuma:
It would appear then, that on the day before the incident... ...the man who visited the park on Lime Street posing as an incognito inspector... ...was not Inspector Gregson at all!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
If that's true, however, how do you explain the inspector's identification?
Kazuma:
...!
Ryunosuke:
This is a genuine identification book, issued by Scotland Yard. It's inconceivable that someone could have stolen such an important item from the inspector. The prosecution made that assertion itself!
Kazuma:
...!
Susato:
And we also know that the inspector had made a note about the Red-Headed League in his diary for that day. Which surely means we can't divorce the two events completely.
Judge:
The inconsistency noted by the defence is most troubling. If it were the real Inspector Gregson whom these two red-headed gentlemen encountered... ...the fact that no bruising can be seen around his neck defies explanation.
Kazuma:
But equally, if they actually encountered an imposter... ...how did that person come to be in possession of the real inspector's identification?
Judge:
Does the defence have some plausible explanation, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
(The whole thing defies explanation.)
Susato:
It is for precisely these occasions that we keep meticulous notes in the Court Record, Mr Naruhodo. Because those are the facts, and the facts cannot lie!
Ryunosuke:
(No, the facts can't lie... ...even when they point to something so incredible, it's almost unbelievable!) Well, My Lord, the true identity of the person who turned up in the park for the Red-Headed League's enrolment... ...is revealed by information in the Court Record, I believe.
Judge:
Good gracious!
Kazuma:
Very tantalising, Mr Naruhodo. So, why don't you help us all to see whatever truth it is that you've apparently seen? Who exactly was this 'inspector' that appeared before Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi?
Gregson himself
Ryunosuke:
Obviously there's nothing to deliberate here. It was Inspector Gregson himself! There's no other explanation, since he was in possession of genuine Scotland Yard identification!
Judge:
.........
Kazuma:
.........
.........
Kazuma:
In that case, I believe I speak for everyone here present when I ask... ...how do you explain the lack of bruising around the victim's neck, which you yourself brought up?
Ryunosuke:
......... Ah, yes...that is the burning unresolved question, isn't it?
Judge:
You claim there's nothing to deliberate, Counsel. However... ...I would implore you give your answers a little more thought in future!
Ryunosuke:
(It's possible I oversimplified that...)
Susato:
It seems to me that the lack of bruising around the victim's neck is the hardest discrepancy to reconcile.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I...think I can see how to tackle this now...
Leads to:
"Though it seems incredible, I admit, the undeniable facts point to only one thing:"
An imposter
Leads to:
"Though it seems incredible, I admit, the undeniable facts point to only one thing:"
Ryunosuke:
Though it seems incredible, I admit, the undeniable facts point to only one thing: Since no bruising can be seen on the victim's neck... ...the person who these two red-headed men took prisoner that day cannot have been Inspector Gregson.
Kazuma:
In other words, your whole argument up to now has been a waste of time.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
On the contrary. I haven't finished.
Kazuma:
What?
Ryunosuke:
There's no bruising on the victim's neck, so the question immediately posed next is... ...who exactly was this man in the park on Lime Street found to be carrying Inspector Gregson's identification?
De Rossi:
Si... Si! That's-a right! We tell the same story every time: Whoever this man was, the capo dragged him from-a pillar to-a post with the dog collare!
De Rousseau:
Mon Dieu, Peppino! I was not so 'arsh as you say, uh?
De Rossi:
So who was that-a falso inspector, ay? Who was he?!
Kazuma:
Clearly the defence has an idea about that. About the true identity of the man these two imprisoned that night...
Judge:
I must ask the counsel for the defence to elaborate posthaste. Who did the witnesses encounter in the park posing as Inspector Gregson?
Present Gossip profile
Ryunosuke:

"Goodness me! Isn't...isn't that...?"

Ryunosuke:
It's surely no secret! THIS is the identity of the imposter!
Kazuma:
...Oh really? On what grounds?
Ryunosuke:
Well...I said it was no secret, but...that part is!
Judge:
Dear me. If ever a penalty was in order, it's now, I feel.
De Rossi:
Like-a the punishment? The capo can lend you his collare if you want, uh?
Kazuma:
Perhaps my learned friend needs to experience what it feels like to be dragged around the streets by the neck?
Ryunosuke:
...I'll use my imagination, thanks.
Susato:
Well, Mr Naruhodo, the red ring produced by the collar is clearly the crux of the matter here...
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, the bruising around the neck...)
Leads back to:
"I must ask the counsel for the defence to elaborate posthaste."
Judge:
Goodness me! Isn't...isn't that...?
Ryunosuke:
One of the witnesses who was in the stand in this very courtroom earlier today! A nameless man, whose only occupation appears to be peddling hearsay to passers-by.
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
What on earth would a street seller be doing with a police inspector's identification papers? Witnesses! Is this the man or not?!
De Rousseau:
What 'as 'appened to 'is lip?
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
De Rossi:
Si, this-a man is not for the Red-Headed League, ay? He's-a looking for the Twisted Lip League, no?
Kazuma:
Perhaps rather than making such a rash claim next time... you should bite your lip instead.
Ryunosuke:
It seems improbable, yes. But one undeniable fact remains! During his testimony earlier... ...I noted something around the man's neck: a red ring of bruising!
De Rousseau:
Eh?
Kazuma:
What?!
Ryunosuke:
The defence demands that Mr Gossip be brought back to the stand!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! ...Bailiff! Bring the aforementioned witness back into the courtroom! Immediately!
Judge:
Well I never... An undeniable ring of bruising indeed. And identical...to that of the witness beside him!
Gossip:
Now what's going on here, eh? I've always had this, me. It's a birthmark, in't it?
Ryunosuke:
A birthmark, you say?
Kazuma:
I assume the reason you've been recalled to the stand has been explained to you?
Gossip:
Aye, um...summat about an inspector again. But I'm telling you, you've got it all wrong as usual.
Ryunosuke:
You're denying all knowledge of it?
Gossip:
Well of course I am! Are you trying to kill me with all this nonsense, eh?
Kazuma:
Well...at least you'll have more stories to peddle back on Fresno Street, won't you? Now, we're going to need you to testify again.
Ryunosuke:
And you, Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi. I'm sure you'll cooperate, won't you?
De Rousseau:
Do we 'ave any choice?
De Rossi:
We are in big-a trouble, ay, capo?
Judge:
That's quite enough dilatory chatter. Proceed with the testimony!

Ze man who claimed to be an inspector zat day... was definitely not zis man.
De Rossi:

I'm all alone in the world, me. I've no kinfolk or nothing. Why would I be involved in something like that?

De Rousseau:
What 'ave I been telling you, uh? Zere was no need for zis pointless testimony.
Ryunosuke:
Uuugh...

That's right. I'm just a simple pedlar, remember. Fresno Street's all I know. How would I have come by a police inspector's identification book, eh?
Ryunosuke:
Well, yes, that's hard to explain, but...

Hmph. A brief cross-examination, I think, Counsel. Very brief.
Ryunosuke:

I stand steadfastly at your side as always, Mr Naruhodo!

Ze man who claimed to be an inspector zat day... was definitely not zis man.

Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So you say. But how can you be quite so certain?
De Rousseau:
Zere is no need to 'urt your 'ands on ze desk, monsieur. Surely ze reason is obvious, non? Because I 'ave never before seen lips like zis.
Ryunosuke:
Nevertheless! There's a clear red mark around Mr Gossip's neck. And it looks very much like that left behind on the neck of your colleague by your prized collar!
De Rousseau:
Mon Dieu! Wiz your words, it is like you try to wring my neck!
De Rossi:
It does look very much like-a my neck though, ay?
Gossip:
No no, this is a birthmark, lad. The biggest lips in London and a neck to die for! Aye, they broke the mould when they made me!
De Rousseau:
For ze first time in my life... ...I feel lucky to 'ave been born wiz red 'air.
Ryunosuke:
(And I thought being Japanese made you stand out in London...)
Kazuma:
So you maintain that you've never seen this man before?
De Rousseau:
Oui, c'est ça. I swear to it by ze flames of my 'air.

Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Well, yes, I don't imagine I'll forget those lips in a hurry, either.
De Rossi:
That is what I am-a saying. For some reason, it makes me wanna eat - how did Fabien call it? - an 'éclair'. You know, I've never seen the hair as black as-a yours before, either.
Ryunosuke:
Likewise, I'd never seen red hair like yours until I came to Britain.
De Rossi:
Si, maybe is a nationale trait, uh? Maybe all the people from this-a man's country have-a the grand lips!
Gossip:
No, lad, I was born right here on Fresno Street. And I've never left.
De Rossi:
Uffa! That is-a the problem, si.
Ryunosuke:
So you definitely didn't go to the park on Lime Street that day, Mr Gossip?
Gossip:
Now how many times do you want me to say it, eh?

I never leave Fresno Street, alright? I've no interest in any Red-Headed League.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So...you'd heard of the Red-Headed League, had you?
Gossip:
You don't get a name like 'Gossip' for nothing, eh? It's my business to know what's going off in town. I sold that tasty titbit to a fair few red-heads that came past me. Just between uz, I even got Sandwich to cough up for it!
Susato:
Well...he does have a very red nose, if that counts.
Ryunosuke:
...Who knows?
Gossip:
But as you can see, my own hair's not got a hint of red in it. And in any case, Fresno Street's my patch. You won't catch me sidling off to some other part of town. No sir, not likely!
Pursue Fabien de Rousseau
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Mr de Rousseau!
De Rousseau:
Uuugh! Ah...oui? Can I 'elp you?
Ryunosuke:
Did Mr Gossip's words just now lead you to remember something relevant, perhaps?
De Rousseau:
......... It was ze other day, when I was looking for a place near ze park. A small 'ouse or something.
Kazuma:
To be the headquarters of your Red-Headed League, yes.
De Rousseau:
I visited an 'ousing agent on Lime Street, and zere I saw 'im. Zis man was paying money to ze agent.
Gossip:
What?
Ryunosuke:
Mr...Mr Gossip...with a housing agent?!
De Rousseau:
Oui. 'E 'ad some kind of contract in 'is 'and, and zey were clearly discussing terms.
Gossip:
Bu... No no no! You're mistaken, chum! I've never left Fresno Street, me. Like I said before. You've mistaken me for someone else. Someone with the same face!
De Rossi:
No no! The capo is right! I remember it-a too! He was-a paying the man with-a the banknotes!
Kazuma:
With notes?
Gossip:
L-Like I said, that was... That wasn't me!
De Rossi:
I was curious why this-a man with the dirty clothes had so much-a money. So I looked at-a the name on the papers.
Ryunosuke:
And what name was written? 'Mr Gossip'?
De Rossi:
No no, this-a man, he lies! He tells you that he has-a no name... ...but in fact his-a name is Hugh Boone, uh? Is better than Mr Gossip, I think, si?
Gossip:
NOOOOOOOOO!
I'm a pedlar of titbits of information, like I said. On Fresno Street. And that's that. I, I don't much like folk talking about my personal life.
Judge:
Hmmm, indeed... And it is not the intention of the court to invade the privacy of witnesses. Very well, I shall respect your wishes, sir. The aforementioned name shall be redacted from all court records of this trial. Assuming no objections?
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
I'm sorry, My Lord, but the defence does object. Because the name just mentioned has a very deep significance to this case!
Judge:
Good gracious! Do, do you similarly object, Prosecutor Asogi?
Kazuma:
As it happens, My Lord...that particular name has already been mentioned during today's proceedings.
Judge:
Well I never! In what capacity?
Susato:
Hugh Boone... The name of the leaseholder of the room!
Ryunosuke:
Let me put this very simply! The victim's body was discovered...in your rented room!
Gossip:
.........
Kazuma:
I suggest, sir...that you start talking!
Gossip:
Well...alright... ...I suppose that might be the case, aye.
Ryunosuke:
So your real name is Hugh Boone?
Boone:
......... Well just between uz...I don't like to blow me own trumpet, but there's no finer pedlar of titbits in town. So aye, I happen to be able to afford a grubby little room in a falling-down backstreet townhouse.
Judge:
You do?
Boone:
And once every six months, I go and pay the rent to the agent on Lime Street. Aye, I remember now. There were two vulgar red-heads in there last time.
De Rossi:
Ay? If either of us is-a vulgar, is not-a me!
De Rousseau:
Sink again, Peppino.
Kazuma:
Why didn't you bring this up before?
Boone:
It's like I told you already... ...I don't like talking about my personal life. I'm a titbit pedlar as far as everyone else is concerned. No fuss.
Judge:
You will update your testimony to include this most surprising revelation...Mr Boone.
Boone:
......... If I must.
Kazuma:
So the leaseholder Scotland Yard has been looking for since the body was discovered... ...has been here under our noses all along.
Changes statement from "I never leave Fresno Street, alright? I've no interest in any Red-Headed League." to "Aye, I rent the room where that fella was found, it's true. For what difference it makes."
Ryunosuke:
I see...
Gossip:
As it happens, after I sold Sandwich that little titbit about the Red-Headed League... ...he went and got himself some red paint from somewhere. God only knows where, mind. But just between uz...he didn't have the gumption to dunk his head in it.
Boone:
Aye, I rent the room where that fella was found, it's true. For what difference it makes.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So...you live in that room presumably, do you?
Boone:
No, I don't live there! What do you think? There's no bed, is there? Just a desk.
Ryunosuke:
Then...why would you want to rent it?
Boone:
Well, I...I don't think I should have to say, really.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
Then how about the noticeboard in there? Which was covered from top to bottom in confidential documents only the police should have had access to.
Boone:
Ah...no...that board's not mine. The inspector must have brought it along. It's only the other bits and bobs that belong to me. The desk and the chair and that.
Ryunosuke:
Um...people don't generally carry enormous noticeboards around with them... The real question is...why was Inspector Gregson killed there, in your room?
Boone:
......... Well obviously, I've not the faintest idea. I mean, it's causing me no end of bother, to be honest.
Susato:
I [sic] seems to me that Mr Gossip- Sorry, Mr Boone... ...would rather as little is known about his room as possible for some reason.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it does come across that way. And more importantly... ...knowing that the scene of the crime is actually his room completely changes things. In particular, there's one part of his testimony that's really bothering me now.
Susato:
...!
Ryunosuke:
(That's how I'm finally going to undo this man...)
Gossip/Boone:
I'm all alone in the world, me. I've no kinfolk or nothing. Why would I be involved in something like that?
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You mean you have no family?
Gossip/Boone:
No, none at all. So I spend my days on Fresno Street peddling titbits to passers-by... ...hoping - just between uz, this is - that eventually, someone else with lips like mine will come along.
De Rossi:
I don't-a think so.
Gossip/Boone:
You may be right.
Ryunosuke:
Anyway, that mark on your neck is just too much of a coincidence for us to ignore.
Gossip/Boone:
Well what's a fella to do then, eh? If you don't believe me, we're at an impasse. And there's nothing I can do but flick me lip.
Ryunosuke:
(It looks like I'm not going to get anywhere here unless I can produce some proof.)
Gossip/Boone:
You're basically saying I got dressed up and posed as some fancy inspector, aren't you? Well, it's beyond me how you think I could do that.
Present Framed Photograph (after pursuing Fabien de Rousseau correctly)
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Leads to:
"If you have no 'kinfolk' as you put it..."
Gossip/Boone:
Just look at me, eh. Doz it look like I could carry off a disguise with a face like this?
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Maybe you could! Say...with a moustache! Or a beard to cover up that lip!
Gossip/Boone:
Aye, perhaps. But if I was going to stick some fake facial hair on to cover up this fine specimen... ...I'd end up looking like His Lordship over there, wouldn't I?
Judge:
......... ...Pardon? I, I assure you my lips are entirely unremarkable! And I would ask you not to cast such scrutinising looks in my direction, Counsel!
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Sorry...My Lord. (My imagination got the better of me there.)
Susato:
Well, Inspector Gregson did wear a moustache, of course.
Ryunosuke:
You're right! He did! So...perhaps he was hiding something himself...
Kazuma:
He could barely have hidden a crumb in a moustache of that size.
De Rousseau:
And anyway, ze detective we spoke wiz 'ad no facial 'air at all.
De Rossi:
Si, si, the capo is-a right. He was-a clean shaven.
Judge:
Hmmm... It certainly seems beyond the realms of possibility that this witness could have disguised himself as the victim.
Gossip/Boone:
Aye, it doz and it is!
Before pursuing Fabien de Rousseau correctly
Ryunosuke:
(That's the extent of their testimony, is it?)
Susato:
What's your feeling, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Well, what Mr Gossip says is undeniable: It would be all but impossible to hide those lips with any form of disguise.
Susato:
Perhaps, yes... But nevertheless, the mark around his neck is equally undeniable. And it's identical to the one that Mr de Rossi suffered.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's true... (But why does this whole disguise idea just keep playing on my mind...?)

If you have no 'kinfolk' as you put it... ...then explain why it is that among the sparce furnishings, we found this photograph in the room?
Boone:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
I presume, as you've been renting the room, that this photograph belongs to you, does it not?
Boone:
Oh, um...well...
Ryunosuke:
Mr Boone, drop the pretence...and tell the court exactly who you really are!
Boone:
I, I don't know what...what you mean. I'm a pedlar! I, I keep telling you so! You really don't need to bother with me. Please, just...just leave it alone!
Kazuma:
As the man says... ...leave it alone. Whatever the truth is about this man's life, it has no bearing on this case. Because it's simply not possible that he impersonated Inspector Gregson!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
How can you be so sure?
Kazuma:
Just look at the man! No amount of disguise could ever hide those unmissable features!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But what if...we were to look at this the other way around?
Kazuma:
What do you mean?
Judge:
Yes, Counsel, what do you mean?
Ryunosuke:
Well...there's no denying that Mr Boone's lip is very prominent indeed. But consider the possibility...that his prominent lip is itself part of an elaborate disguise!
Boone:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Then hiding that prominent feature - in other words revealing his true face... ...would make an utterly impenetrable disguise! Wouldn't you agree...Mr Hugh Boone?
Boone:
Aaah... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
Judge:
Good- Witness! Are you still hiding the truth from this court?!
Boone:
.........
Susato:
If, if that's a disguise, then... ...underneath it, his true identity must be...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's right. There's really only one person he could really be. My Lord! The defence believes it can reveal Mr Boone's true identity to the court!
Boone:
No... Please...no...
Judge:
Very well then, Counsel... What is the true identity of this pedlar who goes simply by the name of 'Gossip' on the street?
Present Daley Vigil profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Your real name...is actually Mr Vigil, isn't it?"
Present Gossip profile
Ryunosuke:
Judge:
This is the person that lies beneath the disguise, you say?
Ryunosuke:
Without question, My Lord!
Judge:
But...would it therefore not be the case... ...that those lips are no disguise at all?
Ryunosuke:
GAAAAAAAAAH! Ugh...I walked right into that one, didn't I?
Susato:
I'm afraid so. And I really can't sympathise.
Ryunosuke:
(I can't help being a little curious about how it would feel to have a lip like that, actually...)
Susato:
Don't dig yourself in any deeper now, Mr Naruhodo.
Leads back to:
"Very well then, Counsel..."
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Judge:
Heavens above! That's, that's who's hiding under this man's disguise, you say?!
Ryunosuke:
It's really not much of an exaggeration to say... ...that anybody could be Mr Gossip just by attaching that enormous bottom lip!
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
If that's what you think... ...then why don't you put on some fake lips and try living as a street pedlar yourself?!
Ryunosuke:
GAAAAAAAAAH! Ugh...I walked right into that one, didn't I?
Susato:
I'm afraid so. And I really can't sympathise.
Ryunosuke:
(I can't help being a little curious about how it would feel to have a lip like that, actually...)
Susato:
Don't dig yourself in any deeper now, Mr Naruhodo.
Leads back to:
"Very well then, Counsel..."
Ryunosuke:
Your real name...is actually Mr Vigil, isn't it? Mr Daley Vigil.
Boone:
YAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
Judge:
I don't recall that name, Counsel. Who is this Mr Vigil?
Ryunosuke:
It's a name I encountered yesterday, My Lord. It has to do with a certain client of Mr Herlock Sholmes. A young gentlewoman came to the detective asking him to locate her missing husband. The woman in this photograph, in fact. This is Mrs Vigil.
Kazuma:
W-What?
Ryunosuke:
From what I understand, you haven't returned home since the night before the inspector was found dead.
Boone:
Erm...
Ryunosuke:
But of course on that night, you were being held captive by the two Red-Headed League men.
Kazuma:
And last night, you were put up by the prosecution service in preparation for testifying in this trial. Because we'd been led to believe that you, Miss Venus and Mr Sandwich were all homeless. Being important witnesses in this case, we needed to know where we could find you, of course.
Ryunosuke:
And that explains why you've not only been unable to return home, but also unable to contact your wife... ...who's been beside herself with worry, waiting for you at the Vigil residence.
Boone:
Now, now just you hold on a minute! I don't have the first idea-
Ryunosuke:
What I'm talking about? Really?
Boone:
...!
Ryunosuke:
It's a simple enough matter to confirm my suspicions! All we have to do is pull off that disguise!
Boone:
N-No... Please!
Judge:
Bailiff! Bring soap, a sponge and a washbowl at once! Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi, you will restrain the witness!
Oui, My Lord!
Si, My Lord!
Boone:
UWAAAAAAAAAGH!
N-No... Stop... Get off... Please...
DOOOOOOOOOOOON'T!!!
.........
Judge:
Well... ...we are now seeing your true features, I presume?
.........
Kazuma:
Lift your head, sir. So the court can see your face.
.........
Judge:
It would appear that the defence counsel's assertion was entirely correct. This has all been a very elaborate deception. So, witnesses, tell the court: have you seen this man before?
De Rousseau:
I, I don't believe it, but...
De Rossi:
Si, there is-a no question. This is-a the inspector we saw in the park!
Judge:
Extraordinary!
Ryunosuke:
On the day of the Red-Headed League enrolment... ...the man claiming to be Inspector Gregson who appeared before Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi in the park...
Kazuma:
...Was you, disguised as the inspector! Or rather... ...was you posing as the inspector in no disguise at all!
Vigil:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Mr Vigil was formerly employed as the chief warder at Barclay Prison.
Judge:
The chief warder? Then your career had promise. Why, you would quite possibly have become the future governor of the prison. What on earth have you been doing peddling tittle-tattle on Fresno Street?
Ryunosuke:
Well, it's been ten years since Mr Vigil worked at the prison.
Kazuma:
Ten years?
Vigil:
......... I'm...I'm really dreadfully sorry about all of this. Yes, it's true... I am Daley Vigil.
Kazuma:
And you were the chief warder at Barclay Prison ten years ago...? ......... So where did Mr Hugh Boone come from?
Vigil:
Boone is...the other me. It's a name I invented.
Judge:
Well...evidently there is a great deal under the surface here.
Vigil:
I'll...explain everything. I'll tell you just how wretched my life has become.
Vigil:
As you say, it was ten years ago now that my employment as Barclay's chief warder came to an end. Having left the prison service, I searched for some new occupation by which to earn a wage. But times were hard in London, and I found no suitable engagements at all. In desperation one day, I turned my hand at selling wares on Fresno Street.
Ryunosuke:
But your wife appears to know nothing of this. She still maintains that you are the chief warder at Barclay Prison.
Vigil:
I was utterly determined that my wife should not know of my failings. Which is why I've never told her. I opened an account at the bank under the name of Hugh Boone... ...and I rented the cheapest room I could find on Fresno Street.
Ryunosuke:
The scene of the very crime we're investigating.
Vigil:
...Yes, that's right. A place from which I could emerge every morning at eight as a squalid pedlar... ...and transform myself back every evening at five into a well-dressed man about town before returning home. That quickly became my daily routine.
Kazuma:
I was puzzled by the lack of furniture in the room... ...but that explains it.
Ryunosuke:
But why on earth didn't you just tell us this in the first place?
Vigil:
I have a wife, sir. And two sons. And without wishing to sound self-conceited, they regard me with some pride. I...couldn't bring myself to disappoint them.
Ryunosuke:
So instead you decided to conceal your occupation from them?
Vigil:
...Yes. I've made such a terrible mess of everything...
Kazuma:
Still, one thing doesn't add up. No matter how many 'titbits' of information you could sell to passing gentlemen, even at sixpence a piece... ...you couldn't hope to match the salary you must have commanded as chief warder at the prison.
Judge:
Very true. To have kept your family in comfort, despite ten years of somewhat misbegotten employment...
Vigil:
......... That was all thanks to Inspector Gregson.
Ryunosuke:
Wha...? Inspector Gregson?! What on earth...?
Vigil:
It was some years after I'd invented Boone and begun my other life as a street seller. He - the inspector, that is - recognised me one day.
Judge:
Do you mean to say...the victim was an acquaintance of yours?!
Vigil:
I knew him from my time working at the prison. When he saw what I'd become, he...was deeply troubled for me and my family. And from that day forward, he visited me on Fresno Street with increasing regularity. Then one day...he asked me if I would carry out a secret assignment for him.
Ryunosuke:
A, a secret...?! What was it?!
Vigil:
I was to...impersonate the inspector.
Kazuma:
What?! Impersonate him?!
Vigil:
We always met in that little room so the inspector could brief me. 'Visit Orczy's tomorrow and take a statement from the proprietress.' It was always something along those lines. Surveillance work, interviewing people... On those occasions, he would lend me his identification so people would believe who I was. My instructions were to make an impression. To let people know that Inspector Gregson had been at work. And for those services, he compensated me financially.
Judge:
A Scotland Yard inspector willingly relinquished his identification into your care with intent to deceive?! That - as I'm sure I need not point out - is a very serious criminal offence.
Kazuma:
But why? What was the point of you impersonating him?
Vigil:
I...I truthfully do not know. All I can say... ...is that the inspector warned me on numerous occasions:
Gregson:
Now remember, Vigil. I need your solemn word. You don't blab about this to anyone, alright? Ever! Even if... Well, if I end up a croaker.
Vigil:
In time, he started to bring papers with him to the room as well. It became something of a second office for him.
Ryunosuke:
So...in fact... ...the person who declared himself to be Inspector Gregson at the park on Lime Street was really....
Vigil:
Yes. It was me. Acting on the inspector's orders. As usual, I removed my Boone disguise... ...and then went as instructed to the park, armed with the inspector's identification book. It never occurred to me...that the bruise on my neck might give me away.
.........
Kazuma:
Well... ...it would seem this confession completely destroys the defence's case.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Judge:
Explain yourself, Prosecutor Asogi.
Kazuma:
My learned friend's assertion was as follows: The victim was killed at another location on the day before his corpse was discovered... ...at the hands of these two Red-Headed League men when they imprisoned the inspector.
Vigil:
But no! That can't be! After all...it wasn't the inspector who went to the park that day; it was me!
Susato:
Oh goodness...
De Rousseau:
Finally, we 'ave clarity. We 'ad nothing to do wiz ze murder of ze inspector. And merci, monsieur de la défense...for proving it.
Ryunosuke:
Wha... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Indeed it would appear that we have reached a de facto conclusion of sorts. These witnesses had no involvement in the murder of the victim... ...as proven, somewhat ironically, by the defence.
Ryunosuke:
Uuugh...
Judge:
I hereby call an end to the cross-examination.
???:
Hold it!
Kazuma:
Pardon me, My Lord, but with your permission... ...I would like to pose one further question to the witness.
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma...?
Judge:
What question, Counsel?
Kazuma:
It concerns the events of ten years ago. I believe you would have been present at a very significant execution that was carried out at the time.
Vigil:
Ten years ago...?
Ryunosuke:
...! (The execution of the Professor...Genshin Asogi!)
Kazuma:
I want to know...exactly what your involvement was.
Vigil:
Oh!
Kazuma:
Answer me, man!
Vigil:
...!
Judge:
One moment, Counsel! Is this related to the current case?
Kazuma:
......... Naturally. It is the prosecution's belief that this case and the events of ten years ago... ...are inextricably linked.
Judge:
Hmmm... Does the defence concur, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
(Kazuma... You're not yourself. You're not as calm and collected as usual.)
Susato:
Poor Kazuma-sama. No wonder he's acting this way. Mr Vigil's memories of what happened ten years ago... ...would tell the tale of Genshin Asogi's last moments. His own father...
Ryunosuke:
I know. I do understand that. (But even so...) Kazu- ...Prosecutor Asogi.
Kazuma:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Do you genuinely believe... ...that this question requires an answer in order to learn the truth behind Inspector Gregson's death?
Kazuma:
I need you to trust me. ...Please.
Ryunosuke:
......... Very well. Then the defence has no objection.
Judge:
...I see. In that case, you will answer the question, witness.
Vigil:
......... The, the truth is... ...I remember very little of that time.
Kazuma:
You've forgotten?!
Vigil:
I'm sorry to say, yes. As I said, I resigned from my role at the prison ten years ago. But for some peculiar reason...my memory of the events leading up to that moment is extremely hazy.
Kazuma:
.........
Susato:
Does that not strike you as strange, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
Well, ten years is a long time... ...but to have forgotten the reason why he left such an important job...
Ryunosuke:
Yes...you're right. (And not only that... ...Mr Vigil's claim contradicts what we already know.)
Kazuma:
The human spirit is a fragile thing. It's broken all too easily. Which is why... ...we have a tendency to wrap it up for protection.
Vigil:
Sorry? The, the human spirit...? I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean.
Kazuma:
When we experience pain and suffering that we feel unable to bear... ...we block it out. Obliterate it from our memories. Seal it away. But it never truly leaves us. If the seal is broken, the memories resurface. And when they do...that fragile spirit may finally be crushed.
Vigil:
But, but I really don't...
Susato:
Kazuma-sama...
Kazuma:
But if it must be crushed, then so be it! Because the truth will not stay buried! It's coming out...one way or another!
Ryunosuke:
......... (Right... Now I understand. It's clear what his intentions are. He means to expose the truth...at any cost.)
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Perhaps if I pointed out the contradiction in what Mr Vigil claimed earlier... ...it might cause some crucial memories to return to him. ...But should I? Should I present the evidence or not?)
Do it
Ryunosuke:
(I have no idea how this is going to go... ...but this is a court of law and I have a duty to pursue the truth!)
Leads to:
"Mr Vigil! I'd like you to look at this..."
Leave it
Ryunosuke:
(If it could genuinely crush the man's spirit... ...I can't be responsible for that. I don't have the right.)
Susato:
Kazuma-sama won't rest until he knows. And this is a court of law. Where nothing is more sacred than the pursuit of the truth.
Ryunosuke:
...! (Susato-san's right. I knew the risks when I took the decision to fight this trial. Whatever the consequences...I can't shy away from my responsibility now.)
Leads to:
"Mr Vigil! I'd like you to look at this..."
Ryunosuke:
Mr Vigil! I'd like you to look at this... Evidence that clearly contradicts your version of events!
Present Dismissal Notice
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Just a few moments ago, you made the following statement:"
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
......... (No, this isn't it! What am I doing? There's no point deliberately trying to deceive myself. I've got to look this truth squarely in the eye!)
Vigil:
W-What do you mean to do? The way you're looking at me...
Ryunosuke:
(He claims that he resigned from his job at the prison all those years ago. But we have decisive evidence that says differently.) I'm sorry, I made a mistake. Allow me to present the evidence again.
Leads back to:
"Mr Vigil! I'd like you to look at this..."
Ryunosuke:
Just a few moments ago, you made the following statement: 'I resigned from my role at the prison ten years ago.'
Vigil:
Ah...well, yes...
Ryunosuke:
In other words, you claim to have left the post of chief warder of your own volition.
Vigil:
Well...yes, of course. ...Why?
Ryunosuke:
Tell me... ...do you remember seeing this document before?
Vigil:
No. No, I don't.
RYunosuke:
This is a dismissal notice ordering the immediate termination of a prison staff member's employment.
Kazuma:
A dismissal notice...?
Ryunosuke:
And the name on the notice...is yours, Mr Vigil.
Vigil:
Wha...? WHAT?! It's...it's...MINE?!
Kazuma:
So you didn't resign from the prison service at all. For some reason...you were dismissed as chief warder from Barclay.
Vigil:
No, there's...there's been some mistake. I'm...I'm sure... I'm sure I tendered my resignation! This dismissal notice is nonsense! ...Isn't...it?
Kazuma:
If you were forcibly dismissed, there must have been good reason. Clearly...you did something. Mr Vigil! It's time to break the seal and have you remember!
Vigil:
.........
Kazuma:
......... According to the few remaining records... ...the final execution that you supervised was on 17th June ten years ago. And on that day, something very serious took place at Barclay Prison.
Vigil:
The 17th...of June...
Ryunosuke:
Was, was that... ...the Professor's execution?
Vigil:
Pro...fessor...
Kazuma:
As you were the chief warder at the time, it stands to reason... ...that you would have been present throughout the proceedings.
Vigil:
It, it does...sound...familiar...
Kazuma:
And yet! That execution never took place! ...The convict, ostensibly executed earlier that day, later re-emerged from his grave...
Vigil:
The convict...came back to life...
Ryunosuke:
In the cemetery in the middle of the night. There was a witness.
Susato:
However, the witness claims that a moment after he saw the convict clambering out of his grave... ...a gunshot rang out from over his shoulder. And the bullet pierced the Professor's chest...killing him instantly. Those may have been the Professor's actual last moments.
Vigil:
Yeees... Yeeeeeesss...
Kazuma:
Seeing as you were in charge of overseeing executions at the time... ...you must know the truth about what really happened! It's in your head! Somewhere deep down!
Vigil:
.........
Kazuma:
Well...Chief Warder Daley Vigil? I know there are memories in your head that can explain what happened on 17th June ten years ago. And now it's time...for you to drag them up!
Vigil:
Agh... Aaaaaagh...
Ryunosuke:
Mr...Mr Vigil...?
Vigil:
......... .................. Yes... The whole prison... It was complete chaos... The prisoner escaped... He was killed...in the cemetery... The shocking news ripped through Barclay like a hurricane...
Ryunosuke:
Wha......... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
Judge:
O-Ordaaar! ...Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Do, do you mean to say, Mr Vigil... that your memories of the time have returned?
Vigil:
My head, it's... It's like some floodgates have been opened. The images... The screams...
Susato:
Oh...my goodness...
Vigil:
The papers... There...were reports... Articles...about a man who'd seen a ghost...
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Enoch Drebber.
Judge:
But, but surely those reports were exaggerated...
Vigil:
......... There were traces at the scene...
Susato:
Traces of what?
Vigil:
In Lowgate Cemetery...at plot number 139... Blood... Lots of blood... That's where the man was buried of course. Obviously...something terrible had happened there.
Judge:
The depths of conspiracy and depravity from which this tale is emerging are quite staggering.
Kazuma:
I've reviewed the police records from that time extensively. A thorough investigation was conducted by Scotland Yard... ...to ascertain how the convict managed to escape in the first place. And the conclusion reached by the investigating team was... ...that a member of the prison staff must have been involved.
Judge:
Are you suggesting... ...that a prison warder abetted the man's bid for freedom?!
Vigil:
Yes... Yes, and I...I was suspected of doing it. Of using that mass murderer's execution...as a way to help him escape...
Ryunosuke:
You did what?!
Vigil:
I remember now. The horror of it all is coming back to me. One evening a few days after the execution, some detectives came to the prison. I was called to the governor's office at the top of the watchtower.
I'm sorry, Daley, this is a serious business. But I cannae help you noo. As chief warder, you were responsible for overseeing the execution afore, eh? Well, it seems the fellas at Scotland Yard want to have a few wee words with you aboot it. You'd better pack your things, laddie. You're to attend in person.
Vigil:
As soon as he told me that,  my mind just went completely blank. And...and the next thing I knew, I...
(The Professor... The most hated killer in our country's history... And I let him escape. I'm finished... My life......is over!)
Vigil:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Bailiff! Fetch a doctor at once! Court is adjourned for today with immediate effect!
So, with Mr Vigil's collapse, proceedings came to an abrupt end for the day... ...once again overshadowed by the legacy of that notorious killer, appearing like a cursed ghost ship on a foggy ocean. Lord van Zieks, Mr Vigil, Kazuma...and Gregson... All of them bound by invisible chains anchored to the same wreckage in the murky depths of the past. But the miraculous light that had been trying to cut through the gloom and shine on those tragic events... ...was playing on the edges of the truth at last.
To be continued...
Examine insignificant area on evidence
Ryunosuke:
I can't find anything out of place.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
That last statement was contradictory in a number of ways, I think you'll find!
Judge:
In a number of ways, you say?
Ryunosuke:
That's right, My Lord. In a number of ways!
Judge:
Perhaps it would serve you well to concentrate your efforts on one contradiction at a time, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... I made a bit of a mess of that. In a number of ways, actually.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
The witness's last statement is clearly contradictory when you consider this piece of evidence here! Yes! Undeniably!
Judge:
You say it's undeniable, Counsel, but I fail to see any contradiction here at all.
Ryunosuke:
......... I think perhaps that itself is the contradiction.
Judge:
...Indeed.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... Time for a rethink...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
My Lord! There are clearly grounds for being suspicious of that last statement!
Judge:
I'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see why.
Ryunosuke:
Well, you know...I was just playing devil's advocate!
Judge:
...Yes. You do appear to have something of the devil in you, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
(Says the man merrily dishing out penalties...)

Well, Miss Venus?! What do you say?
Venus:
I say that'll be six 'undred pennies.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Venus:
That's my banter on the street whenever anyone comes along.

Venus:
Tsk! Miser!
Pursue "Gossip" incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Gossip! Do you have something to say?
Gossip:
I do as it happens! Your timing's perfect. I've just got wind of a juicy tale that'll be right up your snicket. You don't want to let this one slip by, I tell ya. And sixpence is all I ask...
Ryunosuke:
...Maybe try Prosecutor Asogi instead.
Kazuma:
I don't want your gossip, Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
Pursue "Sandwich" incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sandwich! Do you perhaps have something to fill us in with?
Sandwich:
A w-wise philosopher once said that p-people are nothing more than mindless signposts.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sandwich:
Which means... ...that signposts are n-nothing more than mindless people...if you think about it.
Ryunosuke:
......... Perhaps mind less about philosophy and mind more about the proceedings?
Pursue Fabien de Rousseau incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Mr de Rousseau! Is something wrong?
De Rousseau:
I was just considering something.
Ryunosuke:
About the testimony? Did something that was just said jar with you?
De Rousseau:
Non. I was considering my next cunning plan.
De Rossi:
Fantastico, capo! The Hairlarious Brothers are-a gonna be back in action, ay?
De Rousseau:
I sink my next enterprise will be an exclusive club called...ze Four-Eyed League!
Ryunosuke:
...Kindly discuss your upcoming criminal activities once you're back in your cell.
Pursue Peppino de Rossi incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Mr de Rossi! Do you have something to say?
De Rossi:
Che? What?
Ryunosuke:
You looked as though you were thinking of something... whilst eating a mouthful of pasta.
De Rossi:
......... Ah, si. I was-a thinking... ...perhaps my hair is this-a colour because I eat too much Bolognese sauce.
Ryunosuke:
...No comment.
Pursue "Hugh Boone" incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Boone! Do you have something to say?
Boone:
I do as it happens! Your timing's perfect. I've just got wind of a juicy tale that'll be right up your snicket. You don't want to let this one slip by, I tell ya. And sixpence is all I ask...
Ryunosuke:
...Maybe try Prosecutor Asogi instead.
Kazuma:
I don't want your gossip, Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
Too many penalties
Judge:
That will do! I believe I have heard quite enough evidence to form an unbiased opinion. As this is a closed trial, the findings of this court will not be disclosed to the public. However, this will be the very last time the Reaper stands in this or any other courtroom.
Ryunosuke:
B-But, My Lord! Wait!
Judge:
Barok van Zieks, in accordance with the findings of this court, I pronounce you...
Guilty
Judge:
That is all. Court is adjourned!
