The First Story
Special Court
Judge:
I don't quite know what to say... I am truly shocked... ...to see the Storyteller again! Alive and well!
Storyteller:
This was unexpected by me too, as I did not plan to appear before you all again. I was convinced that you would all see the last of me at the parade.
Judge:
But...this is the trial for your murder! And you are alive...
Maya:
Yeah! See? No one was killed! So let's call this whole thing off and never have witch trials again!
Phoenix:
Wh-whoa, Maya...take it easy. We're still in court, remember?
Maya:
But what's the point of this? The Storyteller wasn't killed! Espella would never do anything to harm her dad!
Layton:
Layton:
If only it was as simple as that to end this trial. However, it is not, Miss Fey.
Maya:
But...Professor!
Layton:
Search your memory and you will know the reason why. The crime Miss Cantabella is accused of is not just murder. The purpose of the Witches' Court is to sentence the witches for what they are. Isn't that right, Mr Storyteller?
Storyteller:
............
Layton:
I fully intend to expose the true identity of Bezella. And this would not be possible... ...without you, Mr Storyteller, on the witness stand.
Storyteller:
I see... And so, you assumed the role of an inquisitor just to lure me here?
Layton:
Be that as it may, the inquisition still maintains that... Espella Cantabella is the Great Witch Bezella!
Espella:
............ Dad...
Storyteller:
It's been a long time, Espella. Four years, in fact. You must have experienced many hardships, living among the townsfolk. This daughter of mine...never fits in with the others, no matter how hard she tries.
Espella:
No, it wasn't quite like that. There were people who supported me. Aunt Patty was very kind, and the customers who came to our bakery were nice to me.
Storyteller:
I'm happy to hear that. I wanted to watch over you, ever since you left for the town. But in the end...I failed to do so. I had no idea of what was happening to you. I am...very sorry, Espella.
Espella:
Oh, Dad, you don't need to apologise to me for anything. It's me that owes you an apology. I was...I was...trying to hurt you...
Storyteller:
It was all my fault, not yours. There's no reason for you to blame yourself.
Espella:
Dad...I'm happy we got to talk.
Storyteller:
Espella...
Espella:
You were so busy writing everyone's stories that we stopped talking to each other... Before...it was different. You used to have time for me.
Storyteller:
Please forgive me. Why did it have to come to this...
Layton:
Mr Storyteller. It's time to put everything in order now.
Storyteller:
...!
Layton:
The townsfolk and your daughter deserve to know the truth. The truth about yourself and the Story.
Storyteller:
............ Yes, I suppose it is time I told you the truth. ...Your Honour!
Judge:
Y-yes, Mr Storyteller?
Storyteller:
Let us begin. In this trial...I shall be judged.
Judge:
............ Understood. The witness shall testify!
Storyteller:
People of Labyrinthia who have gathered in this court! I will now tell you the true story. Many of you will certainly find it hard to believe and difficult to accept. Nevertheless, I ask you to please lend me an ear and listen with open minds. Espella, my dear daughter... I ask you to do the same, too.
Espella:
............
Witness Testimony
- The Truth about Labyrinthia -
Storyteller:
Although you know me as the Storyteller, I have one more identity. I am the president of Labrelum Inc.
This whole town...is one of Labrelum's research facilities. It may be hard for you to comprehend...
This land is rich in a very special substance, which affects everyone who lives here.
This substance enables the manipulation of people's minds. And that is what Labrelum is researching.
This experiment began ten years ago. The townsfolk all became test subjects.
............
Judge:
............ I...I don't understand. What does it all mean? I don't quite understand what I've just heard.
Storyteller:
I do not blame you. I suppose all the townsfolk are just as confused. Labyrinthia is an artificial town, created entirely by me. But, of course...
as artificial as it may be, it is the reality for those that live here. For the past ten years...I have been bringing the illusion to life by writing the Story.
Judge:
I...I am lost for words. It feels as if the whole world has been turned on its head.
Layton:
Your Honour, it is certainly not an easy matter to grasp this new situation at once. Regardless, I suggest we hear more of what the witness has to say.
Judge:
Yes, I agree, let's continue. The defence may begin the interrogation!
Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honour.
Cross Examination
- The Truth about Labyrinthia -
Storyteller:
Although you know me as the Storyteller, I have one more identity. I am the president of Labrelum Inc.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
............ (Uhm... This is too much! I don't even know where to start!)
Layton:
Labrelum Inc.? That's a name I have heard before. It is a global pharmaceutical company with headquarters in England. If my memory serves me right, it was founded by Arthur Cantabella.
Storyteller:
Indeed. That is my true name.
Layton:
Were you familiar with that, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
S-sure! Yeah! I've, uhh...heard of Labrelum Inc., of course.
Layton:
Labrelum Inc. is known for developing a completely harmless anaesthetic about 20 years ago. It is now widely used in hospitals all around the world. The company is also working on various other plant-derived sedatives, revolutionising medicine.
Storyteller:
I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by your vast knowledge, Mr Layton.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That's irrelevant! That fact is just based on the real world we're from, not Labyrinthia!
Layton:
The real world, Mr Wright? Then what would you call the world we are in now? Do you think this is a fantasy?
Phoenix:
No, that's not quite what I meant...
Layton:
Mr Wright, I do not mean to be so rude as to presume I know what thoughts are running through your head... However, Labyrinthia is certainly not a place within a book or in the past. Labyrinthia is a part of the world we know!
Phoenix:
Huh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Maya:
But, but! How could a town like this exist in the real world?
Layton:
Do you think it's impossible? Why would that be? Are you saying that everyone would know about an unusual town like this, if it existed?
Maya:
It's...something like that. Anyway, it would be on a map, at least!
Storyteller:
No. I'm afraid that cannot be so.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Storyteller:
This town is not marked on any map. It doesn't officially exist.
Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean?
Storyteller:
The answer is quite simple.
Storyteller:
This whole town...is one of Labrelum's research facilities. It may be hard for you to comprehend...
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This whole town is a research facility?
Storyteller:
Yes. This whole area is a private property of Labrelum Inc.
Phoenix:
So...they own all this land, then.
Storyteller:
That is why Labyrinthia is not marked on any map and people from the outside cannot enter. We have taken measures to ensure that this town is not noticed by local residents.
Phoenix:
What measures are you talking about?
Layton:
Consider the fact that magic is supposed to exist in this town. Perhaps special mechanisms that were used to create "magic" also serve to conceal Labyrinthia. There are limits to what "magic" the Shades are capable of producing on their own, after all.
Storyteller:
That is the case indeed. The "magic" in this town has been made feasible owing to the latest technology.
Judge:
Tech...technology? Tricks? I cannot believe this...
Layton:
However, there is one question... There is no industry in Labyrinthia. How do you obtain necessary commodities?
Storyteller:
Very observant, aren't you? All commodities are regularly shipped in by sea. A young man once made his way here on a freighter and took Espella out of the town.
Layton:
That was Carmine Accidenti, a friend of mine.
Phoenix:
(Hmm, I see... But, is something on this scale really possible?)
Storyteller:
As you might suspect, it would be beyond the power of Labrelum Inc. to keep a facility this size a secret for so long. Labyrinthia is a project co-funded by the British government.
Phoenix:
What? It's a government project? But what would be their stake in this?
Storyteller:
............ It's all because of my beliefs.
Phoenix:
(His beliefs?)
Judge:
............ Ah, by the way...
Storyteller:
Yes? Your Honour?
Judge:
What is a research facility? I've never heard of anything like that before.
Storyteller:
Ah yes, that was careless of me. Naturally, you wouldn't know what it means. How should I explain... This whole town is my creation.
Judge:
Ah, that's what it was about! In other words, it's all your Story. That makes it all clear.
Phoenix:
(Swing and a miss, Your Honour...)
Storyteller:
Getting back to the topic... There is an important reason why we have chosen to build such a facility here.
Storyteller:
This land is rich in a very special substance, which affects everyone who lives here.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
A special substance? What does it actually do?
Storyteller:
This area has been isolated since ancient times, developing its own unique culture.
Layton:
There are underground ruins on the verge of the town. We've found writings there, presumably left by the natives of this land. A bell that was supposed to be there was missing.
Storyteller:
............ So you have seen the ruins. I suspected that you would find them. Then perhaps you have also noticed... that everyone who lives here has a very peculiar condition.
Judge:
A peculiar condition, you say! [sic] I can't just sit here quietly like a patient old man when you're saying such things! Just what kind of condition is it?
Storyteller:
You have every right to know. This condition makes people fall unconscious upon the sound of a certain metal being struck.
Phoenix:
M-metal? What kind of metal?
Storyteller:
Pure silver. And so there is not a single object made of silver in Labyrinthia.
Phoenix:
(Now that I think of it, that's true. Just imagine what a disaster a fancy dinner would be, if everyone fainted whenever they used silver cutlery...)
Storyteller:
This condition is an integral part of "magic".
Layton:
How so?
Storyteller:
All inhabitants of Eldwitch Woods carry small silver bells.
Layton:
I see now. The Shades ring the bells when they need to create the illusion of magic. Everyone present falls unconscious, and the Shades set to their work.
Maya:
Oh, look at where that Shade's hand was! So that's the secret of the time-stealing magic Darklaw told us about!
Phoenix:
(Now that they mention it... Kira had a small bell with her when we saw her back at the marketplace...)
Storyteller:
We have been researching this condition at Labrelum Inc. And finally, we discovered its cause. It was the groundwater.
Judge:
Water causes it?
Storyteller:
The groundwater contains a certain unique substance found in the soil in this area.
Maya:
So if you drink that water, you get this... silver allergy thing?
Judge:
B-but...of course we've been drinking it. It's impossible to live without water.
Storyteller:
Of course. That's why everyone who lives here has that condition.
Judge:
Oh...oh dear...
Storyteller:
You needn't worry. This condition is harmless. Especially as silver is unknown to the townsfolk.
Maya:
Hm, something's still not quite right though. If the sound of silver bells makes people pass out, why don't the Shades pass out, too?
Storyteller:
Although the effect of the substance in the groundwater is powerful, it doesn't last long. The condition will vanish after a day or so without drinking that water.
Phoenix:
Uhh...that's convenient...
Storyteller:
That substance's effects aren't limited to humans. It can also affect plants to a great extent.
Layton:
Plants...are affected by it?
Storyteller:
Our research was focused on the plants rather than humans.
Storyteller:
This substance enables the manipulation of people's minds. And that is what Labrelum is researching.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That sounds really scary... Just what is this about?
Storyteller:
The substance enters the groundwater, affecting organisms that consume it.
Layton:
People who drink it daily acquire that odd condition. They fall unconscious upon hearing the sound of silver metal.
Storyteller:
Yes. Although, the substance in the groundwater also has a tremendous effect on plants. Wild flowers in this area contain a certain poison.
Judge:
Upon my beard! Poison?
Storyteller:
This poison doesn't harm the body. It has the effect of manipulating the mind.
Phoenix:
So it brainwashes people...
Storyteller:
I've been writing the Story for ten years...
Layton:
The title of the Story is... Historia Labyrinthia?
Storyteller:
The ink I used to write it...was made from those plants.
Maya:
Oh, Nick! Do you remember how funny the ink smelled?
Storyteller:
That was the gas released when the ink evaporates. And that's where the trick is.
Maya:
Whaaat?
Storyteller:
Those that inhale the gas become extremely susceptible to suggestion.
Maya:
You mean, brainwashing?
Storyteller:
They will believe anything they are told, or anything they read, however strange or unrealistic. It will be imprinted into their minds as the truth!
Layton:
So that was the true purpose of the parades. Pages of the Story, written in that special ink, were regularly distributed among the townspeople. It was done so that everyone would be in a state of hypnosis.
Storyteller:
Indeed. "The Creation of a Fully Controlled Town with the Inhabitants Subject to Long-Term Hypnosis" That was one of the topics of our research.
Phoenix:
Then...the story that is written in the Historia Labyrinthia...
Layton:
You could call it a self-fulfilling prophecy, realised through the Shades' work and the hypnotic effect of the ink vapours.
Judge:
Is that...how it was all this time...
Phoenix:
(Labrelum used hypnosis to control all these people... I can't believe that the government was supporting that!)
Storyteller:
This experiment began ten years ago. The townsfolk all became test subjects.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
All the people subjected to this experiment have been living here all this time?
Storyteller:
No, we started with just a few people, gradually getting more and more.
Layton:
I must say that I am afraid of what the answer to this question might be, but where did these people come from? You haven't resorted to abduction by any chance, have you?
Storyteller:
Of course not. Every test subject signed a contract with Labrelum.
Phoenix:
A contract to have their memories erased and be used like pawns in a story?
Storyteller:
The current inhabitants of this town have one thing in common. They were all dissatisfied with their lives and wanted to start anew. Forgetting about their mistakes, forsaking unwanted identities. There are more people like that out there than you might think. They have all agreed to participate in our research.
Phoenix:
But...that's insane...
Storyteller:
It's not as unreasonable as you suggest. We give them a new identity, a chance to start their life again. In return, they subject themselves to hypnosis and live in this town as our test subjects. In order for this project to be possible... we suppress their memories of the past, including the memory of signing the contract. So, ultimately, they are not aware of what is going on.
Judge:
I couldn't agree more. I've got no idea what's going on.
Storyteller:
Let me make this clear, Mr Wright. We do not erase their memories. We suppress them. They will regain their memories of life before Labyrinthia once their contract is over.
Maya:
So, this place was uninhabited before you started this research ten years ago?
Storyteller:
............
Phoenix:
And you've managed to keep everyone in a state of hypnosis for ten years straight?
Maya:
Can you really hypnotise someone for that long? I mean, ten years is one heck of a long time.
Storyteller:
It was achieved through the distribution of the Story during parades. The ink vapours have a powerful effect, but it wouldn't last ten years, of course. With each parade, the effect was renewed. That's why the parades took place at regular intervals. That was the true purpose of that event.
Phoenix:
(All right...so that's it.)
Maya:
That was...sorta mind-blowing, wasn't it? The townspeople seem to be in shock. They've gone completely quiet.
Phoenix:
(No kidding. They just heard that their town is really a research facility run by some company.) At least Mr Cantabella seems prepared to tell us the whole, honest-to-goodness truth. So let's put our surprise to the side and get every last detail out of him.
Maya:
Yeah! Let's press him on everything he says, from start to finish!
Phoenix:
(It's a shocking revelation, even for us... I've got to stay focused and pay attention to everything he has to say.)
After pressing all statements:
............
Storyteller:
I have been born and raised here. It was a poor, small town with no industry to speak of, that had fallen behind the times. Ever since I was a child, I had one friend that was especially close to me. He was a bright boy, curious about the world. His name was Newton Belduke.
Judge:
Sir Newton Belduke...
The alchemist!
Maya:
So they were childhood friends... The plot thickens.
Storyteller:
He had always been interested in the unique natural features of this land. There was really nothing here, but to us this area was an exciting place worth exploring. And one day we made an astonishing discovery on the outskirts of the town. We stumbled upon the entrance to the underground caverns leading to the colossal ruins.
Whoa, look at that, Newton! This is so amazing! And this strange writing! I've never seen anything like it before!
We found ancient writings in the ruins. Newton managed to decode some of them. According to our findings, a highly advanced culture had existed on the land where our little town was built. Some great calamity had befallen the natives, and they migrated elsewhere. They believed that plants and water in that area were cursed by an entity they called the Great Witch Bezella. The natives sealed the curse within the ruins and left in search of a new home.
Storyteller:
That is all that we managed to decipher.
Phoenix:
Bezella's curse...
Layton:
It was sealed in the ruins, you say? Would that be the Bell of Ruin?
Storyteller:
The Bell...of Ruin...
Maya:
Oh, that's the bell from the bell tower. I wonder why it's got an ominous name like that.
Storyteller:
Regrettably, we couldn't get any further information from the writings at the time. Needless to say, Newton and I were very excited by the discovery.
I knew it! This place is special. It has some kind of mysterious power! If we could find out what that is, our humble town would become famous! You know what, I'm going to do that! I will unravel the mystery of this place!
Storyteller:
And so Newton began studying the indigenous plants, and substances dissolved in the groundwater. On the other hand, I studied economics and management at a university in London. I dreamed of bringing prosperity to this poor, forgotten town. I wanted to change it for the better with my own hands. Meanwhile, Newton had succeeded at extracting a new anaesthetic from the local plants.
Layton:
Was that the anaesthetic which led to the foundation of Labrelum?
Storyteller:
Yes. It was a huge success for Labrelum Inc. And before we knew it, we were making a fortune. We wanted the whole world to hear about our home town. Alas, fate was not kind to us, as we never realised that dream. Everyone in our town...had died. All the townspeople perished.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
Just what on earth happened to them?
Storyteller:
............ That does not matter any more. We purchased the environs of our town - the mountains, the lake, the plains...everything. Then, ten years ago... having received financial support from the government, we started Project Labyrinthia.
It was much smaller in the beginning. It started as no more than a village. Over the course of ten years, it slowly grew into a town. The population increased as well.
Layton:
More people were signing the contract with Labrelum, slowly increasing the number of inhabitants, correct?
Storyteller:
Yes. They would sign the contract, be hypnotised and assigned a role, and then be introduced to the world of the Story.
Phoenix:
............
Layton:
............
Judge:
............
............
Storyteller:
I have spoken at length. Thank you for patiently listening to my tale. "Bezella" is the name of a witch from an ancient legend that we read about in the ruins. It is a fictional character. She does not exist.
Judge:
B-but then...magic and witches...
Storyteller:
Magic is just an illusion. And there are no witches.
Maya:
All right, so it was all fake... That doesn't make it much better! Why did you write a story where people get killed with magic and witches are thrown into the fire? You could've made it a peaceful, pleasant world, where everyone would be happy!
Storyteller:
No, that was not possible.
Maya:
But why?
Storyteller:
This is a research facility, after all. We're researching ways to completely control human beings. Test subjects need to be exposed to extreme situations, so we decided on a fantasy setting. We wouldn't have got funding from the government otherwise. In other words, we're running a business.
............
Phoenix:
But just what instructions do you give to the people you hypnotise? You don't give each of them a full set of memories of their whole fictional life, do you?
Storyteller:
No, it's much more simple than that. We only give them two pieces of information. The first one - that they were born in this town. And the second was their new occupation. Then they fill in the gaps themselves, without being aware of it. The human mind requires a consistent story of one's life. Which means, of course... that no Labyrinthian has memories from earlier than ten years ago. No one has any memories from before they came to Labyrinthia.
Judge:
What...what are you saying...
That...that's all one big lie! I am who I am...But can you remember your childhood? I can't...That's true! I can't remember...even my parents!N-no way! I can't recall my own mother's face!
Storyteller:
As you can hear, no one can remember their real past. There are no exceptions.
............
Phoenix:
(Huh? Wait a second... No exceptions? I smell a contradiction here!)
Layton:
Ah, it seems Mr Wright, too, has noticed it now.
Storyteller:
What are you talking about, Layton?
Phoenix:
Mr Cantabella, you have just testified that... not a single citizen of this town remembers anything from more than ten years ago.
Storyteller:
Yes, as that is the truth.
Phoenix:
Now, that's a strange assertion, especially coming from you.
Storyteller:
What? What do you mean?
Phoenix:
There is one person in this town... who remembers what happened more than ten years ago!
Storyteller:
That cannot be! It is impossible. They must be merely imagining things now!
Layton:
Mr Wright, please enlighten us all. Who is this person that remembers their past?
Present Espella Cantabella profile
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Precisely, Mr Wright... That person is none other than Espella Cantabella."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Layton:
By the way, Mr Wright. Do you remember my name?
Phoenix:
Y-yes, of course! You're Hershel Layton!
Layton:
That's a weight off my mind. I was concerned for a moment that your memories had evaporated, too.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
That is to say, pull yourself together, defender!
Phoenix:
Arghhhhhhhh! (Dang.)
Maya:
Wow, you've been served some gentlemanly sarcasm, Nick!
Judge:
Well then, let's give the defence one more chance.
Phoenix:
(Someone in this court said they remember things that happened a long time ago... Now, who was that?)
Leads back to:
"Mr Wright, please enlighten us all."
Layton:
Precisely, Mr Wright... That person is none other than Espella Cantabella.
Storyteller:
What?! That's impossible!
Espella:
It's true, Dad! I...remember it clearly, as if it happened yesterday. The Legendary Fire!
Storyteller:
N-no, that's impossible! That's just your imagination, Espella!
Espella:
No, it's not! I couldn't remember it before, but it all came back to me! Because...I'm Bezella.
Storyteller:
No, no, no! Espella, there are no witches! That fire, it was just a bad dream!
Layton:
The inquisition would like to call Espella Cantabella to testify!
Judge:
Wh-what...
Layton:
Regardless of whether Miss Cantabella is Bezella or not... her memories may contain valuable clues!
Judge:
Hmph. Yes, that may be so.
Storyteller:
No, wait! I don't agree to this! This trial is over, Your Honour!
Layton:
Layton:
You seem to be forgetting something, Mr Cantabella. Your Story has ended. You are no longer in control.
Storyteller:
...!
Layton:
You are merely...one of the characters. And this is also why we will not cease seeking the truth until we find it.
Storyteller:
Grrrr!
Judge:
Defence, what is your opinion on this?
Phoenix:
(Espella keeps insisting that she's the witch Bezella. As her attorney, I should refuse to let her speak to the court. But what's really important now... is finding the truth, just as Layton said.) There's only one way to proceed with this trial. And that's...by questioning Ms Cantabella about her memories!
Judge:
In that case...the court summons Espella Cantabella as a witness! Attendants! Bring the accused to the witness stand!
Judge:
Now, witness. Testify about your memories of the Legendary Fire.
Espella:
Yes, Milord.
Witness Testimony
- The Legendary Fire -
Espella:
I was...just a little girl then. It happened during the annual fire festival.
Everyone was gathered in the town square for the fire festival, and I was watching them from the bell tower.
The Great Witch Bezella awoke within me and brought calamity upon the town.
An enormous fire dragon appeared. I was trembling with fear, terrified by what I had summoned.
Judge:
Witness, what you have told us... wasn't a bad dream or a fairy tale, but what you actually experienced?
Espella:
Yes, it was. Like I have already said. I remember it very clearly. The heat from the fire, the smell of smoke...
Storyteller:
Espella, what are you talking about...!
Layton:
............
Judge:
The defence may cross-examine the witness!
Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honour. (Was there really a huge fire that destroyed the town? And what about Bezella? Is she even real? The answers are in Espella's testimony!)

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Do you remember what age you were then?
Espella:
I'm not quite sure, but I think I was six or seven.
Layton:
And how old are you now?
Espella:
I'm 18 years old.
Judge:
That means those events did take place more than ten years ago. It's very odd that you have memories that old. But perhaps you're mistaken about your age at the time.
Layton:
Layton:
Your Honour, no one besides Espella has witnessed the Legendary Fire. Which would mean that the incident occurred before Labyrinthia was created, over ten years ago.
Judge:
Hmph... Yes... I suppose that makes sense.
Storyteller:
That doesn't make any sense at all! How many times do I need to tell you there are no witches, no magic! The Legendary Fire is just a story. This interrogation serves no purpose!
Judge:
Mr Cantabella. The court asks you to be quiet during another witness' [sic] testimony unless you are asked to speak.
Storyteller:
Grrrrr...!
Espella:
............
Espella:
Everyone was gathered in the town square for the fire festival, and I was watching them from the bell tower.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Could you tell us a little more about this "fire festival" you were watching?
Espella:
Yes, it seems to be an ancient custom in this area. The townspeople make a fire offering to the Great Witch Bezella so that she will not bring misfortunes upon them. A great fire is lit in the middle of the town square. The festival lasts all night long.
Judge:
That's correct. The festival takes place once every year. It is quite magnificent with all the townsfolk assembled in the square. Unless...it is a counterfeit memory, imprinted in our minds by you.
Storyteller:
No, this festival has been held here since before I was born. It appears to be a very old custom indeed.
Phoenix:
By the way, why were you in the bell tower in the first place?
Espella:
Huh?
Phoenix:
You know, you said everyone was at the town square. Why weren't you there?
Espella:
............ I can't remember. I probably went there...because Bezella awoke within me.
Layton:
Despite having vivid memories of the fire, you do not remember much of anything else that occurred at that time?
Espella:
Y-yes. I was at the top of the bell tower, looking down at people in the town square... Someone was with me there. Ah, that's right. It was Eve.
Phoenix:
(Eve... Her black cat, huh.)
Maya:
I didn't think Eve was that old.
Phoenix:
Hmm?
Espella:
Well, then...
Espella:
The Great Witch Bezella awoke within me and brought calamity upon the town.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Do you remember casting a spell?
Espella:
............ I...cannot remember. But the town, perishing in the flames so fast, is engraved in my memory...
Question Storyteller
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
You look upset, Mr Cantabella.
Storyteller:
............ Ah, pardon me. Did you want something?
Phoenix:
I'd like to know what you think about Espella's last statement.
Storyteller:
............ My opinion about all this has not changed since last time. It's all just a dream.
Espella:
...!
Storyteller:
Listen to me, Espella! You are not Bezella! There was no Legendary Fire!
Espella:
Dad...you have no idea how much I want to believe you! But...I just can't. I remember what I saw! And how it felt - the heat, the smoke!
Storyteller:
Magic doesn't exist; it belongs in fairy tales. There are no fire dragons either!
Layton:
Espella seems certain that she saw a fire dragon at that time. However, as long as we do not have any evidence to support or disprove this claim, we can't make any progress.
Phoenix:
(Hmm, do I have any relevant evidence? Anything that could demonstrate that the "fire dragon" Espella saw as a child was real...)
I have evidence
Phoenix:
Your Honour.
Judge:
What is it, defender?
Phoenix:
The defence will...present evidence.
Layton:
............
Storyteller:
Evidence? I suppose you mean evidence that will prove... that my daughter's memories of the dragon amount to nothing more than wild imagination?
Phoenix:
On the contrary... I'm pretty positive Espella did see the dragon.
Storyteller:
What? I thought you had more sense in you!
Judge:
Well, well, aren't we all curious about what the defence has got to show us? Present evidence that proves a dragon appeared in this town over ten years ago!
Present anything
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Well, how about this?!
Espella:
............
Storyteller:
............
Layton:
Mr Wright... You just said aloud "How about this?!" Was that addressed to anyone here?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
Ah, he seems to be confused.
Layton:
Perhaps you were so lost in your thoughts that you didn't realise... that you vocally expressed something obviously meant for yourself.
Phoenix:
Aaaaaack! (I knew it - it was the wrong evidence!)
Maya:
Nick, maybe we don't have the right thing to present just yet?
Phoenix:
Maybe. I wasn't too sure about that piece of evidence. It was more of a gamble, to tell you the truth... (I might need more information here.)
Judge:
Witness, continue your testimony!
Espella:
Yes, Milord.
Leads back to cross-examination
I've got nothing
Phoenix:
(I don't think there's anything I could use.)
Layton:
............ I can understand your choice to be cautious with your judgement, Mr Wright. However, I must remind you... that the only way to discover the whole truth... is to bring to light the true nature of the dragon witnessed by the accused.
Phoenix:
............ (Hm, I guess he has a point there. Maybe I overlooked some clues in the testimony?)
Maya:
Let's arm ourselves to the teeth with evidence and give it another shot!
Phoenix:
All right. But first, we need more info.
Maya:
Time to do some pressing!
Judge:
Witness, continue your testimony.
Espella:
Yes, Milord.
Leads back to cross-examination
Judge:
That must be a very harrowing memory...
Espella:
I think that... whenever Bezella takes over my body, my consciousness drifts away. But, I'm sure of it! There's no mistake about me being Bezella!
Layton:
What makes you so certain about it?
Espella:
Because...because Eve has always been with me.
Phoenix:
You mean that black cat? How is that relevant?
Judge:
According to the legend of Bezella, she is always accompanied by a black cat. That small furry animal is actually her minion. In the stories, that is.
Espella:
Eve was there with me. I'm sure she was. And I saw the town, engulfed in flames!
Phoenix:
(These memories are causing her a lot of pain...)
Maya:
Espella...hang in there...
Press (after Fire Dragon Sketch is added to Court Record)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Do you remember casting a spell?
Espella:
............ I...cannot remember. But the town, perishing in the flames so fast, is engraved in my memory...
Question Storyteller
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
You look upset, Mr Cantabella.
Storyteller:
............ Ah, pardon me. Did you want something?
Phoenix:
I'd like to know what you think about Espella's last statement.
Storyteller:
............ My opinion about all this has not changed since last time. It's all just a dream.
Espella:
...!
Storyteller:
Listen to me, Espella! You are not Bezella! There was no Legendary Fire!
Espella:
Dad...you have no idea how much I want to believe you! But...I just can't. I remember what I saw! And how it felt - the heat, the smoke!
Storyteller:
Magic doesn't exist; it belongs in fairy tales. There are no fire dragons either!

I have evidence
Phoenix:
Your Honour.
Judge:
What is it, defender?
Phoenix:
The defence will...present evidence.
Layton:

Storyteller:
Evidence? I suppose you mean evidence that will prove... that my daughter's memories of the dragon amount to nothing more than wild imagination?
Phoenix:
On the contrary... I'm pretty positive Espella did see the dragon.
Storyteller:
What? I thought you had more sense in you!
Judge:
Well, well, aren't we all curious about what the defence has got to show us? Present evidence that proves a dragon appeared in this town over ten years ago!
Present Fire Dragon Sketch
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"It is, of course, Espella's drawing of the dragon."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Well, how about this?!
Espella:

Maya:
Espella...hang in there...
Espella:
An enormous fire dragon appeared. I was trembling with fear, terrified by what I had summoned.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Can you tell me more about that fire dragon?
Espella:
That monstrous image is still so vivid... It looked just like the one that attacked Dad this evening! I have...I've done something terrible again!
Layton:
Then you are sure that the fire dragon you saw more than ten years ago and the one summoned this evening... were exactly the same?
Espella:
Yes. They were definitely the same.
Question Storyteller (before Fire Dragon Sketch is added to the Court Record)
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Is something wrong, Mr Cantabella?
Storyteller:
............ It's impossible... There's no such thing as magic.
Espella:
You never believe me, Dad. I don't know why you have to be like this. There was a time when things were different.
Storyteller:
Espella, what are you saying! [sic]
Maya:
Look at them. It's like a common argument between a teenager and a parent.
Phoenix:
(Mr Cantabella created this town. He knows better than anyone else that there's no magic here.)
Layton:
Miss Cantabella.
Espella:
Yes?
Layton:
Would you mind giving us more details of what you saw?
Espella:
............ Could I borrow a sheet of parchment and a pencil? I think it'll be better if I draw it.
Judge:
Your request shall be granted. Bring parchment and a pencil for the witness immediately!
Espella:
This is it. This is the fire dragon that I saw that night. I only caught a glimpse of it. But it was real.
Phoenix:
............
Judge:
............
Storyteller:
............
Layton:
I must say... it does closely resemble the supposedly magical creature we witnessed this evening.
Judge:
It does indeed. This drawing shall be added to the evidence.
Fire Dragon Sketch added to the Court Record.
Storyteller:
This is a farce...
Phoenix:
(What happened over a decade ago? Was the town really destroyed by a fire dragon?)
Layton:
Discovering the truth about the dragon shall be our next objective.
Judge:
Witness, continue the testimony!
Espella:
Yes, Milord.
Leads back to cross-examination
Phoenix:
But, Espella, magic isn't real! Therefore, the dragon summoned by the spell Granwyrm doesn't exist either!
Espella:
But I did see it! I'm not lying! I saw it just for a moment, I'm sure of it!
Phoenix:
(It's like talking to a wall! There's no convincing her!)
Layton:
There may be another explanation. Espella might have seen something in the shape of a dragon.
Phoenix:
(All right then...)
Maya:
Uhm, Nick? Mr Cantabella wrote this town's Story, right?
Phoenix:
Well, yeah.
Maya:
So he's the author, and he's saying that Bezella doesn't exist.
Phoenix:
That's right.
Maya:
If that's the case, then there's no point to this whole trial!
Phoenix:
We know that, but that's not enough to end it.
Maya:
But why?
Phoenix:
The professor has taken on the role of inquisitor in this trial in order to get Mr Cantabella to testify. He wants to get to the bottom of this mystery.
Maya:
And learn the whole truth...
Phoenix:
Besides, I think this will be in Espella's best interest, too. I trust the professor's judgement on this. So I'll carry on with the cross-examination.
Maya:
Well, I trust you, Nick! I'm sure you know what you're doing.
Phoenix:
It is, of course, Espella's drawing of the dragon. It's impossible to draw a dragon with so much detail unless you've actually seen it!
Judge:
Indeed! And it looks very much like the fire dragon we saw this evening. It cannot be a mere coincidence.
Storyteller:
You can't possibly use that drawing as evidence!
Judge:
And...why not?
Storyteller:
Because she could have just drawn the "dragon" from this evening!
Espella:
Dad! Why don't you believe me! [sic] I saw that dragon when I was little...
Storyteller:
This town is my creation! I know everything about it. And I assure you there's no magic! If there's anyone who can tell you what's possible and what is not, it is me, the creator of Labyrinthia!
Layton:
Your overconfidence... has clouded your judgement and is preventing you from seeing the truth.
Storyteller:
...! Wh-what do you mean?
Layton:
In order to see what is really there, you need to reject biased assumptions and keep an open mind. You are overlooking certain facts precisely because you are the creator of this town.
Storyteller:
It's nothing short of insanity!
Layton:
Magic doesn't exist. And yet, Espella says she saw a fire dragon. It seems like a contradiction. But perhaps...it is not. Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Y-yes?
Layton:
The solution to this mystery is out there. We just need to find it. Do you suppose you know where it is? "Magic doesn't exist." "Espella saw a fire dragon." Where is the evidence that bridges the gap between the two?
In the Court Record
Phoenix:
If anywhere, it's got to be in the Court Record, right?
Maya:
Wh-what?! Nick, what's wrong with you? We're talking about evidence relating to what Espella saw from the bell tower over ten years ago. We don't have anything that would fit the bill in the Court Record!
Layton:
It would serve you well to listen to Miss Fey. What Miss Cantabella saw then...is where she had been at the time.
Judge:
Where she had been?
Layton:
You do remember her testimony, don't you? She was in the bell tower when she witnessed that monstrosity.
Phoenix:
(The bell tower, huh...)
Leads to:
"Over ten years ago..."
In the belfry
Phoenix:
There's only one way to explain this contradiction. Espella somehow saw the dragon, but it wasn't a magical creature.
Storyteller:
Then will you just tell us what it was! [sic]
Phoenix:
That event took place over ten years ago. What she saw then...should still be in the place where she was at the time.
Judge:
It's still there?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honour. And that place is...the belfry!
It's...in the belfry...?
Leads to:
"Over ten years ago..."
It's the town itself
Phoenix:
Espella was watching the town burn at that time. She says she saw an enormous fire dragon. Now, if you put the two together... I think our best guess is that the dragon she saw was this town itself.
Judge:
This town?
Layton:
In other words... Espella saw a dragon's shape looming over the burning town.
Storyteller:
How absurd! That's mere speculation!
Layton:
I will not dispute that. However, it is entirely possible to test our theory.
Storyteller:
What?! And how would you go about doing that?!
Layton:
It is all quite simple, Mr Storyteller. We will now go to the belfry.
Maybe we'll find that "fire dragon" there.
Leads to:
"Over ten years ago..."
The Bell Tower
Layton:
Over ten years ago... The witness was standing somewhere around here when she saw a "fire dragon". Am I correct?
Espella:
Yes, Mr Layton.
Layton:
However, what was it that you actually saw then? Let us see if we can find the answer to that question.
Storyteller:
Why not? Go ahead and try! But, I have warned you that it's futile. You will find nothing here!
Maya:
Well, it happened a long time ago. Whatever she saw might not be there any more... And if we wanna see exactly what she saw at the time...we'll need to set the whole town on fire. Want me to go get matches?
Phoenix:
(I may be an attorney, but even I couldn't clear you of the charges if you ACTUALLY committed such a crime, Maya!)
Layton:
I will pretend I did not hear that. Shall we begin?
Layton:
Let us look for the fire dragon. We can see the whole town from here. Look in every direction for something that would resemble Miss Cantabella's drawing.
Present dragon fretwork on left side
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Espella, can you have a look at this? It looks like the dragon was hiding in here, after all."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Espella, what do you think?
Espella:
Uhm...I don't know... It doesn't look like the dragon I saw...
Storyteller:
Hah! I was right, not Wright.
Layton:
It seems so, unfortunately.
Phoenix:
Oh, we're not done. I was just "testing the waters".
Layton:
Mr Wright. A gentleman should admit his mistake rather than try to cover it up with an unconvincing excuse.
Phoenix:
(An excuse? That's what I get for imitating the professor...)
Maya:
Uhm, Nick? What was that about biased assumptions that the professor said earlier?
Phoenix:
They're what prevent us from seeing the truth.
Maya:
So let's approach this with our minds wide open!
Phoenix:
(And eyes wide open, too.)
Leads back to bell tower examination
Phoenix:
Espella, can you have a look at this? It looks like the dragon was hiding in here, after all.
Espella:
Oh! This...this is...
Maya:
Hey! That's identical to the one Espella drew!
Espella:
But...uhm... It's not...the fire dragon. The fire dragon was a creature made of flames. It was so big it could swallow this whole tower! This is just some tiny fretwork...
Layton:
............ I think we can consider this mystery solved. I suggest we all head back to the court. I will explain everything there. Is that all right with you, Mr Cantabella?
Storyteller:
............
Maya:
What's gotten into Mr Cantabella? He looks paler than you do with a cold.
Phoenix:
I have no idea. Let's follow the others back to the courtroom.
Special Court
Judge:
The inquisition's investigation seems to have yielded some unexpected results. But...can someone explain them to me?
Layton:
Your Honour, the inquisition will interpret the results of its investigation. Witness... You said you were about 6 years old at the time of that incident?
Espella:
Yes, that's right.
Layton:
Did you see the moment the dragon appeared above the town?
Espella:
Huh? N-no... I...don't remember. I remember seeing it at some point. It was like a flash... The town was ablaze, and this fiery beast was hovering above it.
Layton:
Then, when you noticed the dragon, the town was already engulfed by flames?
Espella:
Uhm... Yes.
Layton:
That information completes the picture. Miss Cantabella's statement has offered me an insight into the true story of the fire dragon.
Over ten years ago... Miss Cantabella was in the belfry, unconscious. What events led to this? Perhaps we will discover that in due course. When she awoke, the whole town was on fire. Having inhaled much smoke, she was still dazed. She was only vaguely aware of her surroundings when she looked up, alarmed by the scorching heat. Unable to stand, she was on her knees. And then...she saw something she would remember her whole life.
Anime cutscene
She saw a terrifying fire dragon attacking the town. She saw it through the fretwork in the balustrade! The shape of a dragon against a backdrop of the town being swallowed up by flames... became imprinted in her memory. That is the truth about the fire dragon.
Layton:
This is what I have deduced.
Phoenix:
............
Judge:
............
Espella:
............ It wasn't...a monster?
Layton:
Miss Cantabella, the illustration you have drawn for us bears an uncanny resemblance... to the fretwork in the belfry. You saw the "dragon" when you were confused, possibly mildly asphyxiated from the smoke. There was no magic and no magical beast.
Espella:
............
Storyteller:
You believe a stranger but not your father. That's so typical of teenagers. You should have listened to me! And now that all the mysteries have been unravelled, can we not end this trial and go home?!
Layton:
Layton:
As much as we'd all like to, I'm afraid it is still a bit too early for that.
Storyteller:
What else do you want from us?!
Layton:
There is just one more problem I'd like to solve tonight.
Judge:
One more? What on earth could it be?
Layton:
Miss Cantabella, we've ascertained that you were in the belfry when you saw the "dragon". However, that creates a new question. How did you get there?
Espella:
Oh...I haven't thought of that.
Phoenix:
Yeah, neither have I... Ohhhhhhhhhhh!
Layton:
As expected of an ace attorney, Mr Wright seems to have noticed the problem, too, at last. In order to access the belfry, you need to use the bell tower mechanism.
Phoenix:
The mechanism can only be set in motion with the pendants!
Layton:
Indeed. Miss Cantabella, did you have your pendant with you at the time?
Espella:
I...yes. I think I did. I always had it with me. But why did I have that pendant? I can't remember it at all.
Phoenix:
This pendant is not just for show. It's the key to the belfry. Why was she carrying it around?
Layton:
We must also not forget that one pendant does not suffice to operate the contraption. Two of them are required.
Espella:
Two...pendants...
Layton:
Miss Cantabella. Are you certain that you were alone in the belfry?
Espella:
............ No, I wasn't alone. I was there with a friend.
Phoenix:
What friend?
???:
Meow...
Espella:
Eve! Where did you go off to?
Layton:
The friend you mentioned... Was it this cat?
Espella:
Yes. She's my best friend.
We've always been together. Without Eve, I would have been so lonely.
Maya:
That kitty's always appearing out of nowhere to keep Espella company.
Espella:
Of course she does. After all, Bezella is always accompanied by a black cat.
Storyteller:
............
Layton:
What you saw from the bell tower when you were little was so terrifying that even an adult would have been scarred for life. The town burned in front of your eyes. You thought you saw a fire dragon... You see, your memories have been twisted by the horrors you saw.
Espella:
Wh-what do you mean?
Layton:
The dragon you saw wasn't real. And I suspect... that the friend who was with you in the bell tower might not have been that cat.
Espella:
No, it was her! It was Eve, my only friend...
Layton:
Miss Cantabella, the pendant needed to access the belfry is too large for a cat. Are you following? If Eve was with you, it would have been impossible for you to enter the belfry!
Espella:
Aaaaah!
Storyteller:
W-wait! Inquisitor! Where is all this going?! You have no right to tamper with my daughter's memories!
Layton:
You are right, of course. However, neither do you. Nor should you attempt to cover up the truth!
Storyteller:
Ugh.........!
Espella:
No...you're wrong! Eve was my only friend...
Layton:
Think about that day again, Miss Cantabella. You went to the top of that bell tower with a friend who also had a pendant!
Judge:
Well then, why don't we have the defence present some evidence! Can you prove that someone was with Miss Cantabella in the belfry that day? If so, I'd very much like to see the evidence!
Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Why me? It was the professor's idea! I have nothing on the Legendary Fire! Why ask me for proof...?
Judge:
Hmph. Right. I suppose you wouldn't have any proof. Not one of us remembers that incident.
Storyteller:
I've had enough of this, Your Honour! You have no grounds to continue this trial!
Espella:
............
Judge:
Well, we appear to have reached a dead end. There is nothing else for us to do.
Layton:
Layton:
Please hold on, Your Honour.
Judge:
Oh... What is this, all of a sudden? Inquisitor Layton?
Layton:
The defence does not have the necessary evidence, but someone else does.
Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean?
Layton:
This time the inquisition will present its evidence!
Phoenix:
The inquisition will present evidence, huh... Wait, SERIOUSLY?!
Storyteller:
You...you son of a witch! This is what you wanted from the very start, isn't it?!
Layton:
............
Judge:
Well, in that case... The inquisition shall present evidence that somebody was with Miss Cantabella in the bell tower when she saw the fire dragon!
Present Picture of Two Girls
Layton:
Have a look!
Leads to:
"This is the proof."
Present anything else
Layton:
Have a look!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Yeah...that was random. Or is the inquisition just "testing the waters"? ............
Maya:
What's with that satisfied look on your face, Nick?
Phoenix:
I've always wanted to do this. Everyone's always poking fun at me if I present the wrong evidence. It feels so good to do it to somebody else for a change!
Judge:
Unfortunately, Inquisitor Layton, I fail to see a connection between the matter at hand and the evidence you presented.
Layton:
...Ekhm... Well, if you don't test the waters, you won't know if you're out of your depth. I'll present the correct evidence next time.
Phoenix:
............
Maya:
You're looking very happy again, Nick.
Phoenix:
It's music to my ears. Someone other than me making a silly mistake and coming up with lame excuses.
Maya:
You know, maybe you could use some time off. So that you can release your pent-up frustration...
Leads back to:
"Well, in that case..."
Layton:
This is the proof. This photograph shows Miss Cantabella with a friend.
Judge:
Golly! This is... this is the finest illustration I have ever seen!
Layton:
It's a photograph.
Judge:
It looks as if...as if it were a reflection of the real world on paper! Tell me, who created this exquisite work of art?
Layton:
Well... Your Honour, I understand you are fascinated...but let us focus on what this picture shows. This picture was found in the Storyteller's Tower. Mr Cantabella, we have taken the liberty of borrowing it for this trial.
Storyteller:
It's enough to look away for a second and you already cause trouble!
Maya:
Uhm. Professor? Aren't photographs against the rules? I mean, this is supposed to be a medieval setting.
Phoenix:
Meh, who cares.
Layton:
What's important now is helping Miss Cantabella to grasp the truth. And in this case the end justifies the means.
Storyteller:
Grrrrr!
Layton:
Please take a close look at the two girls in this picture. Each of them is wearing a pendant.
Judge:
Why, that's so! These are the belfry contraption pendants!
Layton:
We know that one of these girls is Miss Cantabella. But then... Who is the other girl?
Judge:
Accused, do you have any idea?
Espella:
............
Phoenix:
Espella? Are you okay?
Maya:
It doesn't look like she is...
Espella:
It's...it's...
It's me... ...and... ...the other girl is... ...she's... I don't know...
Uwaaaaaaaaah!
Storyteller:
E-Espella! Your Honour! Stop this trial! Stop it right now! Can't you see you're driving Espella into insanity?!
Layton:
Layton:
It's just the opposite, Mr Cantabella.
Storyteller:
...!
Layton:
If we turn away from the truth now... Espella will close herself to the world forever!
Storyteller:
Grrrrrr!
Layton:
Mr Wright!
Phoenix:
Yes?
Layton:
You know who it is, don't you? You know the identity of the other girl in this picture.
Judge:
Is that so? If the defence knows that... Tell us all who this other girl is.
Present Darklaw profile
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"I'm thinking it's High Inquisitor Darklaw."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Layton:
Well? That certainly wasn't your intended answer, was it?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
I was expecting you'd name a woman about the same age as Miss Cantabella. I'm astonished anyone would make a mistake...
Phoenix:
Ugh... What can I say? I, err...like to surprise everyone with my answers...
Layton:
If such was your intention, Mr Wright... you would have achieved a greater effect had you said it's Miss Fey.
Maya:
"That was very half-baked, man!" ...Is what the professor is trying to say, Nick.
Phoenix:
Gaaaaaaaah! I'm sorry... Mind if I try again?
Leads back to:
"Is that so? If the defence knows that..."
Phoenix:
I'm thinking it's High Inquisitor Darklaw.
Judge:
High Inquisitor Darklaw?! I cannot say I didn't have slight suspicions about her, but...oh my.
Layton:
Miss Cantabella, what do you say? Do you now remember the girl next to you in this picture?
Espella:
I was with...Lady Darklaw...
Storyteller:
This is crazy! What are you basing this preposterous claim on! [sic]
Judge:
B-but...Mr Cantabella. This girl closely resembles the High Inquisitor.
Storyteller:
Resembles? That's just your personal opinion! It's meaningless in a court of law!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
If you want evidence, I've got it.
Storyteller:
Wh-what?!
Phoenix:
The definitive proof that the girl in the picture is High Inquisitor Darklaw is...
Present Pendant
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"And this is the proof it was the High Inquisitor."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This! What do you say about that?
Layton:
Honestly, Mr Wright... At this point I am beginning to wonder if you aren't giving the wrong answers on purpose.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
It's as if you were hoping something funny would ensue. However, I'm not going to let you make light of this trial for your own amusement!
Phoenix:
Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! (I really wasn't trying to do that...)
Maya:
Nick, you totally did that on purpose, huh?
Phoenix:
I swear I didn't... Although it'll help me save face if everyone thinks I did... (Anyway...I'm gonna try again and get it right this time!)
Leads back to:
"The definitive proof that the girl in the picture is High Inquisitor Darklaw is..."
Phoenix:
And this is the proof it was the High Inquisitor.
Judge:
The pendant needed for that contraption in the bell tower...
Phoenix:
I have Ms Darklaw's testimony here. She said this pendant was hers. And so... the other girl in the picture is definitely Ms Darklaw!
Espella:
Is it...is it really... Eve? Where are you going?
Layton:
I was expecting you, Miss Darklaw.
Darklaw:
I see that I was not mistaken about you. I trusted in your ability to get this far.
Judge:
H-High Inquisitor Darklaw! Where did you just appear from?
Darklaw:
Does your memory not serve you well, Your Honour? You know what I am. I can disappear at will any time I wish to. So, Storyteller... Everything has worked out just as you had written, oh revered creator of Labyrinthia.
Storyteller:
Darklaw...
Espella:
Lady Darklaw.
Layton:
Miss Darklaw... Did you enter the belfry with Miss Cantabella when you were little?
Darklaw:
............ Yes, I did.
Phoenix:
Then you have memories of events from before ten years ago?
Darklaw:
I certainly do.
Judge:
Order! Order! Order in the court!
Espella:
L-Lady Darklaw...you were with me?
Darklaw:
Your memories have been suppressed. By that man.
Storyteller:
...!
Espella:
B-but! I was with Eve...
Darklaw:
"Eve", huh... Eve the black cat?
Espella:
Yes, she has always been my dear friend... She was by my side on that day, too.
Darklaw:
What a bizarre coincidence. "Darklaw" isn't my real name.
Phoenix:
Wh-what?! Then what is your real name?
Darklaw:
............ It's...Eve.
Judge:
What... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
Espella:
You...you are...Eve...? Ah... Ahhhhh...
Eve...Espella...
My dear friend...Eve...
Espella:
It...can't be... That flashback... was it real...?
Storyteller:
Darklaw, why are you doing this? Are you trying to undo everything I have accomplished in the past ten years?
Darklaw:
No. You have already ruined everything yourself.
Storyteller:
What is it that you want?
Darklaw:
What I want? My aim is to make the truth known, so that everything returns to how it should be.
Phoenix:
Ms Darklaw... Will you tell us what you remember about what happened back then, more than ten years ago?
Darklaw:
It would be my pleasure.
It was the day of the fire festival. Espella and I went up the bell tower. The wind was strong that day. When the sun had set, the festival began. It's true that the whole town burned down that day. The fire consumed buildings and people, turning them into ashes. We were the only survivors. We stayed in the belfry while the world below us was being eaten up by hungry flames.
Anime cutscene
The Legendary Fire is no fable. It happened here more than ten years ago.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
There are no such things as magic and fire dragons...so how could a whole town be destroyed in just one night?
Judge:
Yes, that's something I'd like to know as well. Even if we assume the celebratory fires got out of control... Surely the whole town wouldn't have perished like that!
???:
...Now it all makes sense.
Layton:
That was the missing piece of this puzzle!
Phoenix:
What do you mean, Professor?!
Layton:
I can imagine now what transpired that night. What happened in the belfry and what caused the Legendary Fire. We have all the clues we need!
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
If the inquisition has evidence to show us, I'd very much like to see it. What caused the Legendary Fire?
Present Bell of Ruin
Layton:
Have a look!
Leads to:
"The cause of the fire is in the belfry!"
Present anything else
Layton:
Have a look!
Layton:
It is conceivable that it was this, for instance!
Judge:
............ I'm sorry, but I don't see how this could have caused that disaster.
Darklaw:
Hmph. Is that the best you can do? I see I set my expectations far too high.
Layton:
Ugh... Well, haven't you been paying attention? I said "for instance", not that it was definitely the correct item!
Maya:
Professor, I understand your pride has been wounded, but just get over it and show us the right piece of evidence!
Eve:
...Meow.
Layton:
Ugh...
Phoenix:
(Layton's face is so fiery red, it looks as if it could start a legendary fire of its own...)
Leads back to:
"If the inquisition has evidence to show us, I'd very much like to see it."
Layton:
The cause of the fire is in the belfry!
Judge:
It was the bell...?
Layton:
That bell had been made by the natives and later sealed underground. It was called the Bell of Ruin.
Espella:
B-Bell of Ruin...
Storyteller:
............
Layton:
By the way, why does this bell have such an ominous name?
Phoenix:
Hmm... Could it be because it's made of pure silver?
Judge:
Pure silver...?
Layton:
Exactly. Mr Cantabella has told us earlier...
Storyteller:
...that everyone who lives here has a very peculiar condition.
Storyteller:
This condition makes people fall unconscious upon the sound of a certain metal being struck.
Layton:
And that metal is pure silver.
Judge:
Yes...and we've been told the condition is brought about by drinking the groundwater.
Layton:
Indeed. That bell was also the reason why the original inhabitants of this area decided to forsake it. It seems that the Bell of Ruin caused a devastating disaster.
To those who have gained entry into this sanctum, heed our words. You must not ring the Bell of Ruin.
Judge:
I can't help but wonder what disaster this bell had caused.
Layton:
An enormous bell made of pure silver... and the locals with their peculiar condition... It's not too hard to imagine what happened. It was probably the same calamity as the one that happened over ten years ago.
Phoenix:
And that is...?
Layton:
Well, what disaster happened to this town before Labyrinthia was built?
Judge:
Aaah!
Phoenix:
The...Legendary Fire...
Layton:
Now, let us contemplate the following scenario. What would happen if the Bell of Ruin were sounded during the fire festival?
Espella:
Oh...
Phoenix:
Everyone who heard it would fall unconscious.
Layton:
As it was an annual festival, all the townspeople were assembled in the town square.
Judge:
Oh dear...
Layton:
Therefore, on the night of the fire festival over ten years ago... all the residents instantly lost consciousness when the bell was struck.
Espella:
Oh no...
Darklaw:
............
Layton:
Had it been even just slightly windy that day... the fires lit for the Great Witch Bezella would have gone out of control. And they would spread throughout the town with no one left to stop them.
Phoenix:
Because everyone was unconscious...
Layton:
Exactly. That also includes the two girls who were in the belfry.
Darklaw:
Espella and I.
Layton:
You were the closest to the source of the sound, so it was inevitable. When you recovered consciousness, it was already too late. The town had been swallowed by flames, as if a fire dragon had come to burn it. That was a calamity caused by the bell.
Judge:
Calamity...
Layton:
You say here that the cause of calamity is the Great Witch Bezella. That night, in this very town...Bezella was more than a mythical persona!
Espella:
......Be...Bezella......
Maya:
She's losing it again!
Espella:
............ ......The Bell of Ruin...... ......Bezella......
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
To Be Continued...
Layton:
Mr Cantabella. I would like to apologise for putting too much pressure on your daughter.
Storyteller:
...!
Layton:
Only your words can bring her back from the brink of madness. Let her hear the truth from her own father.
Storyteller:
............ All according to your plan, Layton? You've driven Espella into a corner, in order to push me to the wall.
Layton:
I had no other choice.
Storyteller:
Espella, please listen to me.
Espella:
............
Storyteller:
You haven't done anything wrong. You didn't cause that...accident. You have suffered so much, thinking that you were Bezella... I must take the blame for that.
Judge:
You, Mr Cantabella?
Storyteller:
I sacrificed everything to make up for what I've done... But all I managed to do was inflict more pain upon others. Is that not so, Darklaw?
Darklaw:
............
Layton:
Now that you are willing to talk, Mr Cantabella... Would you mind telling us your story? Yours...as well as Espella's and Miss Darklaw's?
Storyteller:
...Very well.
This story, too, began when I was a young lad. When Newton and I were still youths, full of dreams and hope. As you already know, we discovered the underground ruins. And deep within them lay that accursed bell. The Bell of Ruin... At the time, we still lacked the knowledge to decipher any of the writings we found there.
This bell is magnificent! It's bound to make the most beautiful sound! I have an idea! Why don't we make this bell the symbol of our town?How do you propose to do that?Let's build a bell tower for it. Then we can ring it on special occasions!...Hmm, that's not a bad idea.Then it's settled! When we grow up, let's do it!Okay... Just don't forget about it!
Storyteller:
The two of us chose different paths in life. I studied management in London, while Newton devoted himself to the study of the natural sciences.
Layton:
And then...you made a fortune following the invention of a new anaesthetic?
Storyteller:
We both got married around that time, and each of us had a daughter.
Phoenix:
You mean Espella was born shortly after your company gained funding?
Storyteller:
That's right.
We eventually returned to our home town and set about realising our childhood dream. Having built the bell tower in the middle of the town square, we retrieved the bell itself from the underground ruins. We aspired to make it a symbol of prosperity for this unindustrialised town.
The bell was to be officially displayed during the annual fire festival. It would be rung in the morning, following the night of celebration.
Layton:
Pardon the interruption, but at the time, were you aware of the meaning behind the bell's name?
Storyteller:
Obviously, we were not. Thinking back to my ignorance at the time, a chill now runs down my spine.
Espella:
............
Storyteller:
Newton and I went to the bell tower the day before the festival.
Only one more day to go! We've waited a long time for this.
That we have. This town will no longer be the same, after tomorrow.
Storyteller:
The bell weighed so much that ringing it was not easy. We tackled that problem by constructing a special mechanism, which we installed in the belfry.
Daddy, I want to hear the bell! Can I make it ring? Daddy, please! Let me ring it!
Storyteller:
Espella, who was there with us, was utterly enchanted by the bell. She wasn't a bad child, but she was very stubborn and would rarely listen to me when she wanted something. I told her a story to try and convince her to leave the bell alone.
Espella, listen carefully. You mustn't ring this bell.But why? Why can't I, Daddy?You know about Bezella, the witch?Uh-huh. She's an evil fire witch, who uses magic to hurt people!If you ring this bell... Bezella will come out and possess you!Possess me? You mean I'll turn into Bezella?That's right, Espella. When Bezella possess someone, she uses them to do terrible things. That's why you must never ring this bell, sweetheart.I understand, Daddy!There's a good girl.
Storyteller:
The legend of Bezella has been passed around these parts for centuries.
Judge:
It probably originated from beliefs of the tribes that populated this area in the past.
Storyteller:
What I told Espella... was just a silly story that I invented for the occasion. It was only meant to stop her from ringing the bell. I could not have imagined that it would have such far-reaching consequences.
Espella:
............ ............ It's all coming back to me now... I remember that day.
Phoenix:
...!
Espella:
On the day of the fire festival, just around the time when the preparations ended and everything was about to begin... I sneaked [sic] out of our house. I took mum's pendant with me...
Phoenix:
Your mother's pendant? Do you mean this one?
Espella:
Yes. It belonged to my mum.
Storyteller:
We needed to limit access to the bell, so we made the two keys. We decided to make them into pendants and each gave one to our respective wives. Both are needed in order to access the belfry.
Espella:
I saw you and Mr Belduke use them... So I told Eve to meet me at the bell tower.
Daddy says Bezella will come out if I ring the bell. But if I do it just a little... I want to try it while the festival is going on. I hope Eve doesn't forget... her mum's pendant.
Layton:
So it is just as I thought. Miss Darklaw... you are Mr Belduke's daughter.
Darklaw:
Heh. Well done, Inquisitor. ...I was almost afraid you would fail to make that connection.
Judge:
What in the... This is too much for one day! O-order! Order in the court! Lady Darklaw... you mean to say that you're Sir Belduke's daughter?!
Darklaw:
Yes... My real name is Eve Belduke. I'm the "alchemist's" daughter.
Judge:
Th-this is unbelievable!
Darklaw:
I also sneaked [sic] out of my house that evening, clutching my mother's pendant in my hand. I did just as you asked me to, did I not, Espella?
Espella:
............
Espella, my mum's going to be so angry if she notices I took the pendant...Don't worry so much! I just really want to ring that bell. I wanna hear it!........................
Espella:
I rang the bell, against my father's warning. And so, Bezella possessed me. Because of me...the town...and everyone in it... They're all gone.
Storyteller:
No! It's not your fault! Stop blaming yourself!
Layton:
Supposedly, the former inhabitants of this area also used to fall unconscious upon the sound of that bell. Perhaps they experienced a similar nightmare.
Storyteller:
It was I who brought the Bell of Ruin into this town. The one to blame for this calamity is not some witch...it's me!
Espella:
...I brought destruction upon this town... ...I am...Bezella.
Storyteller:
Espella! You're going to drive your dad crazy if you keep repeating that!
???:
...Heh heh heh.
Darklaw:
Seeing you like this is giving me a strong feeling of déjà vu.
Storyteller:
Eve... How can you be so evil? Are you happy now?
Darklaw:
............
Layton:
I'm afraid we're in the dark as regards [sic] Miss Darklaw's sense of "déjà vu"...
Storyteller:
............ Only four people survived the fire.
Phoenix:
Only four...
Storyteller:
Espella and Eve, who were in the belfry. And the only two residents who did not participate in the festival. Newton and I.
Layton:
And where were you at the time, if you'll permit my asking?
Storyteller:
We were investigating those fateful ruins. That's why we didn't notice anything until it was too late. It was getting near the time at which we planned to ring the bell, so we headed towards the town... Then, we saw it...the town had been burnt to ashes, the air shimmering from the heat.
Maya:
That's...too awful for words...
Storyteller:
We searched for survivors, sick with anxiety. Eventually, we found our daughters in the bell tower.
Espella was unresponsive, like a doll. Eve was crying at her side... Our relief at having found them vied with terror caused by the disaster. ...The worst night of my life ended, pierced with the first rays of sunshine. But then... it seemed Espella was already lost to us. We had lost her to Bezella. She wouldn't speak, eat or even leave her room. ...She thought she was Bezella and that she had destroyed the town. I couldn't get that out of her head. What she saw from the bell tower must have been so terrifying. But it wasn't shock from what she had seen. ...My own words had put her in that state. Had I only not told her that stupid story!
We had been grasping at straws, trying to find a way to save Espella's mind. But, whatever we did, her eyes would remain impassive and empty. In the end...I came upon a certain idea that offered us a glimpse of hope...
Judge:
What was it...? This suspense...it's too much for my ageing heart!
Layton:
I believe...I may know what it was. It was the only way to get through to little Espella...
Judge:
Inquisition, what are you talking about? What was Mr Cantabella's idea for saving his daughter from insanity?
Present The First Story
Layton:
Have a look!
Leads to:
"We discovered this in Espella's room."
Present anything else
Layton:
Have a look!
Judge:
Is...that it? I don't quite understand...
Storyteller:
Unfortunately, you were wrong. Even the great Professor Layton can err, it would seem.
Layton:
...Hmm.
Phoenix:
Um, let's not make such a big deal out of it, huh? Let the guy try again.
Layton:
............
Maya:
I don't think you're helping, Nick. If you're going to console him, you should probably wipe that stupid grin off your face first...
Phoenix:
(I don't know why, but...I can't help it!)
Layton:
We all learn from our mistakes. I believe I now know the right answer. It was the only way to get through to little Espella...
Phoenix:
(He just sailed through that like nothing even happened...)
Leads back to:
"Inquisition, what are you talking about?"
Layton:
We discovered this in Espella's room.
Espella:
............
Judge:
Uhm... And that is...?
Layton:
It's a handmade picture book. The illustrations and handwriting are truly exquisite.
Storyteller:
That's the first story I wrote. I made it for Espella after that dreadful fire.
Judge:
Oh! The Storyteller's first story...
Storyteller:
It was but a simple children's story. The plot was very straightforward - the townsfolk join forces to banish evil witches who serve Bezella.
Espella, do you understand now? You aren't Bezella. Bezella is somewhere out there, sending out other witches to do bad things to the people of our town.
Witches, magic, the town perishing in flames...
Storyteller:
Espella was mentally broken, and I couldn't get through to her any other way. I talked to her as if magic and witches were real, avoiding any mention of that fire.
Daddy... Are witches...real?
Storyteller:
Espella spoke to me for the first time in so many days... I was beyond myself with joy and replied without thinking...
Oh yes, they are. They are hiding in the town, among the people.
But...it's just a fairy tale...
Storyteller:
I was desperate. I feared she would close herself off to me again. Now, in hindsight... I see what an utter fool I was. I made an irreversible mistake yet again.
No, it's not. Everything your daddy writes comes true.Oh...The bad witches will get their comeuppance. I will write a story about it.
Storyteller:
And so, I wrote another story for my daughter. A story about mischievous witches getting caught. This time I had the story acted out in front of Espella.
Judge:
You had it acted out?
Storyteller:
Back then...I wasn't the only one tormenting myself over the mental state of my daughter. Newton was going through hell, too. His own daughter had been badly scarred by the event. Isn't that right, Eve?
Darklaw:
............ My father and I repaired a building that had survived the fire and continued to live in this town. Espella wasn't even able to leave her room. We couldn't leave her behind when she needed all the help she could get. Mr Cantabella showed us this book one day. Then...he made an unusual request of us.
I'd like to make this story real. Would you be willing to help me do so?
To our surprise, he was entirely serious. Seeing that...we gladly offered our help. A story about evildoing witches getting caught and punished... And Bezella, the source of them all.
Were you paying attention, Espella? Witches got what they deserved, and peace has been restored to the town.
Espella smiled at the end. Then, she whispered to herself...
...It wasn't me.
Storyteller:
When I saw her smile, I felt as if something broke inside me.
I couldn't afford to let her be sad again. Maybe if Bezella were to exist in this town... Espella would stop thinking she herself harboured the Great Witch. I continued writing stories about witches... Eve and I would act them out for Espella. And gradually...the number of characters in my stories increased. That was, of course, largely due to the ongoing reconstruction of the town.
Phoenix:
How much reconstruction?
Storyteller:
It wasn't anything on a big scale. I simply paid people to move in and act out their roles. But... I began to think that I would need more than that. The story had to be real.
Layton:
To make a lie seem true, you resorted to even more lies...
Storyteller:
Yes. I was certain that was the only way. How did I do so? I remembered about Newton's research.
Phoenix:
He was working on a certain medicine...
Storyteller:
It was a kind of tranquiliser, made from local plants, that he was testing at the time. But it was difficult to put into practical use. The substance had a danger of causing unconsciousness and hypnosis.
Judge:
I can see how that could be abused to cause much harm, supposing it fell into the wrong hands...
Storyteller:
At the same time, it was just what I needed for my ambitious project. I contacted the government... And that was the beginning of what came to be known as Project Labyrinthia. A town with human test subjects, all in a state of long-term hypnosis.
Layton:
You devised that plan solely for the sake of your daughter?
Storyteller:
Yes. We acquired the land which had been laid to waste by the fire. The new town was slowly becoming populated. Gradually, the rules of Labyrinthia were established. It was to be a town where magic and witches were a reality to the residents. All of this was possible thanks to the drug.
Phoenix:
The test subjects were exposed to it through the ink used to pen the Story, right?
Storyteller:
That's right. It was the dangerous drug developed by Newton. About ten years have passed since then. Even now, the town...continues to change.
Phoenix:
............
Layton:
............
............
Judge:
Project Labyrinthia. And all this was done...for one girl...
Storyteller:
Espella was only able to be herself when she lived within my Story. Oh, the irony of it... Only within a world in which Bezella was real could Espella's tragic memories be sealed. All this while... Eve was assisting me.
Darklaw:
............ ...I was the first Shade.
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
As soon as the Story began, I disappeared from the scene. If Espella was to see some magic... then someone had to don this robe.
Judge:
That's the robe of invisibility!
Storyteller:
I gave Espella new memories so that she could live in this town with everyone else. I also sealed the memory of her friend, Eve.
Phoenix:
Wh-what?!
Darklaw:
My existence was too strongly connected to her memory of the fire. Afterwards, I returned as Darklaw, a stranger to Espella.
Phoenix:
B-but! Even if you were doing this for Espella's sake, that's just going too far!
Darklaw:
I made that choice... I do not regret the past ten years. Meanwhile, my father was supporting Labyrinthia from behind the scenes, in his own way.
Judge:
Do you mean his contributions as an alchemist?
Darklaw:
My father's knowledge of medicine was indispensable for this town to function. The hallucinogenic ink was my father's work, as well.
Storyteller:
So it was. Newton and Eve sacrificed more than anyone else for the sake of Espella and this town. I will be forever indebted to them.
Darklaw:
............ We wanted to save Espella, just like you.
Espella:
............
Phoenix:
But then...there's still something I don't understand. Why were you trying to destroy this fake world? In the end...you chose to betray Espella and Mr Cantabella!
Darklaw:
Oh, but I've told you already, have I not?
Judge:
It was your revenge against Mr Cantabella for choosing to end the Story, correct?
Darklaw:
............
Layton:
I wonder...whether that was the true reason.
Phoenix:
P-Professor?
Layton:
Would Miss Belduke really betray them merely because she did not want the Story to end? I dare say there was another, considerably more important reason.
Phoenix:
(She had another reason?)
Layton:
No need to frown in dismay, Mr Wright. Please leave this to me.
Judge:
Well then, let's hear what the inquisition has to say. What other reason led the witness to betray Mr Cantabella?
Present Suicide Note
Layton:
Have a look!
Leads to:
"This letter was Miss Belduke's real motive."
Present anything else
Layton:
Have a look!
Darklaw:
Is this some kind of a puzzle, Inquisitor Layton?
Layton:
It was intended as proof of your real motive for the betrayal...
Darklaw:
I'd say you're a fine traitor yourself. You have betrayed the trust of the profusely sweating attorney over there.
Layton:
Ugh... Not to worry. I was merely warming up.
Judge:
Do not force me to turn up the heat on you, Inquisitor. Be sure to present the correct evidence quickly.
Phoenix:
(Whoa... No love lost between the judge and Layton.)
Leads back to:
"Well then, let's hear what the inquisition has to say."
Layton:
This letter was Miss Belduke's real motive.
Judge:
What is this? I think I've seen it before...
Phoenix:
That's the letter written by Mr Belduke for Mr Cantabella. It's also Mr Belduke's suicide note.
My dear friend... I hope you can forgive me for leaving this world of my own will. What I have done cannot be forgiven. I can never escape from it.
Layton:
Something was tormenting Mr Belduke. It became too much for him to bear and drove him to suicide.
Darklaw:
............ These past ten years... I thought Father was glad to be helping Cantabella. But...little did I know... he was suffering terrible anguish all that time.
Storyteller:
...!
Darklaw:
Cantabella twisted the lives of so many people for the sake of his daughter... Was the Story not but a glorified lie, stripping so many of what little happiness they had?
All those years, Father was racked by a crushing sense of guilt!
Layton:
His agony culminated in the incident of three months ago.
Phoenix:
Mr Belduke's death...
Anime cutscene
Darklaw:
Before Labyrinthia was created...
certain things had to be concealed in order to seal Espella's memories. Had she seen them, she would have remembered... They were simply too dangerous to her. One of them was me. Espella's friend Eve had to be reborn as a Shade and disappear into the forest. The next thing...was the bell tower.
Layton:
I see... Had she seen it, it would have been certain to stir up those traumatic memories. ...Memories of the Legendary Fire.
Darklaw:
The only way to prevent that was to erase the bell tower from Labyrinthia.
Judge:
But how could you do that?
Darklaw:
Using the same method as with this robe.
Phoenix:
The robe of invisibility...
Darklaw:
In short, we covered up the tower with a huge "robe". Although it wasn't as easy as it sounds...
Phoenix:
In other words, the bell tower had been there all this time... Only, the townspeople couldn't see it... Is that correct?
Darklaw:
Indeed.
Judge:
I...I don't know what to say...
Layton:
At any rate, the situation changed due to that lightning strike three months ago, did it not?
Darklaw:
It was a most unfortunate accident. The lightning set the bell tower's cover on fire.
That cover was quickly consumed by flames, revealing that abominable bell tower. The beginning of all of this, the Bell of Ruin, appeared before us... 'Twas mockery of our efforts.
Layton:
That tower emerging from the flames...
must have seemed like a sign of divine anger to Mr Belduke. A sign that no matter how you attempt to conceal your sins, the truth will eventually float up to the surface.
Darklaw:
Having realised this, Father chose death.
Storyteller:
He was such a kind-hearted man... I didn't have an inkling of what he had been going through!
Layton:
To him, the participation of Labyrinthia's people within this project was not voluntary. Even though they had themselves signed the contract, I believe he felt those people were being deceived.
Darklaw:
Father...took his life because of you, Cantabella!
Phoenix:
............
Layton:
............
............
Darklaw:
...Now you know why I did what I did. I lost my father three months ago. That day, my revenge began.
Judge:
Your revenge...
Darklaw:
The first step of my plan was to rewrite the Story.
Storyteller:
Wh-what did you say?!
Darklaw:
As president of Labrelum Inc., you had to spend most of your time in London. Over the past few years, you were coming to Labyrinthia only for the parades. So naturally...I knew you would never notice if the Story were slightly changed.
Phoenix:
That explains it... I couldn't help thinking there was something strange going on. Mr Cantabella is Espella's father after all. He wouldn't have made Espella a witch in his Story.
Storyteller:
Espella was... a witch?! When did that happen?!
Darklaw:
Heh heh heh. How could you have known, after all? Let me fill you in on the details. Espella has already been tried once within the Witches' Court.
Storyteller:
Impossible! Why?! How could you... You knew the risk that would carry!
Darklaw:
Look at you... What a fine author of that grand Story you are. You left all the work in Labyrinthia to me. Meanwhile, you were making millions for yourself in London. What a pathetic excuse for a father. You didn't even notice that your precious little Espella was in such danger.
Storyteller:
Grrrrrrrr!
Layton:
Miss Belduke. Why did you do that to Espella?
Darklaw:
Do you even need to ask? I did it to unlock her memories.
Phoenix:
You mean...
Darklaw:
When the Legendary Fire took place... Espella was so traumatised that she closed herself off to the world. We were just little girls then. That tragic accident was too much for us to handle.
Espella:
............
Darklaw:
This fictitious town was created as a facade, to keep the truth away from Espella. But the weight of all these lies led my father to his suicide. Despite that...the person responsible for all this carried on as if nothing had happened.
Storyteller:

Darklaw:
I couldn't forgive him. As Belduke's bereaved daughter... I had to have my revenge against both Cantabellas. Judge... This is the whole truth. Now you know the true identity of Bezella.
Layton:
Layton:
You say this is the whole truth... But is that really the case?
Phoenix:
Professor...
Darklaw:
What are you going on about now?
Layton:
We have been provided with a clear picture of what happened to Espella so long ago. Nevertheless... we haven't yet heard your testimony.
Darklaw:
Don't be ridiculous!
Layton:
This will be the last testimony in this trial. Tell us about the night of the Legendary Fire. I request that you tell us your story.
Darklaw:
Who do you think you are, Inquisitor?
Layton:
I am merely one of the supporting characters within this tale. However, I am very much interested in the truth.
Judge:
This has been a very long trial...of which this shall be the last interrogation. The court demands that the single other witness of the Legendary Fire provide us with her testimony.
Darklaw:
Very well. There is only one truth... Nothing can change that.
Witness Testimony
- The Truth about The Legendary Fire -
Darklaw:
Espella wanted to ring the bell no matter what, so we went up to the belfry.
The festival celebrations had already started. The mechanism for ringing the bell was at a height even we could reach.
The next thing I remember...is coming to, and running to Espella's side.
I was shaking her until she finally opened her eyes. The next moment...we saw that nightmarish view.
All strength abandoned us, and we didn't know what to do. That was when we were found by my father and Mr Cantabella.
Layton:
The bell could only be rung with a special mechanism?
Storyteller:
That's right. It was made in such a way that even a child could use it.
Darklaw:
It was probably constructed by my father. I suppose he wanted to make it possible for anyone to ring that bell. In light of the events that followed... that was clearly a very foolish decision.
Phoenix:
(A mechanism for ringing the bell...)
(I noticed something like that on a pillar when we went to the belfry earlier. I'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.)
Top Floor Device added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Oh dear... Fate can certainly be cruel.
Storyteller:
I have to agree.
If only we had not discovered those ruins... and brought that bell to our town... Or if only we could have deciphered those ancient writings a little earlier... Moreover...if only the groundwater in this area didn't cause that strange condition...
Layton:
Unfortunately, Mr Cantabella, the tragedy occurred. All that remains for us to do is to seek out the truth. Not for the sake of vengeance...but for the sake of the future.
Darklaw:
............
Layton:
Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Uhm, yes?
Layton:
You have been fighting fiercely to uncover the truth. This is the final interrogation. I trust you know what to do.
Phoenix:
Leave it to me. (To be honest, I have no idea what lies ahead... But whatever it is, there's no question we need to get to the bottom of it. There's got to be light at the end of this tunnel!)
Cross Examination
- The Truth about The Legendary Fire -
Darklaw:
Espella wanted to ring the bell no matter what, so we went up to the belfry.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You needed both pendants to access the belfry, correct?
Darklaw:
Espella asked me to bring my mother's pendant, so I did.
Layton:
That wasn't the only requirement, however. You also needed to solve a puzzle in order to use the contraption.
Darklaw:
I've always been a master puzzle-solver. For me, it was child's play...literally.
Maya:
She solved it when she was a little girl... What's your excuse, Nick?
Phoenix:
Hey! I have...different talents.
Storyteller:
Espella and Eve were best friends at the time. Eve is two years older than Espella. She used to be like a big sister to her.
Darklaw:
............
Layton:
So, the two of you went to the belfry. What happened next?
Darklaw:
The festival celebrations had already started. The mechanism for ringing the bell was at a height even we could reach.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So even a little girl could ring the bell?
Darklaw;
Yes, easily.
Storyteller:
I intended to make it so that the bell would only be rung on special occasions. That's exactly why I put that puzzle in place, to restrict access.
Layton:
You also divided the "key" to the belfry into two components, as an extra precaution.
Storyteller:
I was careful...but the same cannot be said of Newton, who constructed the mechanism as a whole. He presumably wished to make it so that even our young daughters could use it, meaning strength was not a requirement.
Judge:
...And that became his undoing.
Layton:
By the way, how old were the girls at that time?
Storyteller:
Espella was six. And Eve was eight.
Layton:
I see.
Darklaw:
That mechanism was the last thing I saw before falling unconscious. And then...
Darklaw:
The next thing I remember...is coming to, and running to Espella's side.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Do you mean that you fell unconscious after the bell was struck?
Darklaw:
Yes, I believe so.
Storyteller:
Our peculiar condition causes an instant reaction. The brain probably doesn't even have the time to register the sound before consciousness is lost.
Darklaw:
It was almost as if...a slice of time had been stolen from my life. When I opened my eyes, I was lying on the floor. I lifted my head and saw Espella lying nearby. I sprang to my feet and ran to her side.
Phoenix:
And what about the situation in the town at that time?
Darklaw:
I was preoccupied with Espella, so I didn't notice it to begin with.
Layton:
At that time, was Espella still unconscious?
Darklaw:
Yes. I...panicked a little and took her in my arms, hoping she'd wake up...
Darklaw:
I was shaking her until she finally opened her eyes. The next moment...we saw that nightmarish view.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So it was you who woke Espella up, witness?
Darklaw:
Yes, it was me. She was out cold, curled up on the floor, until I shook her awake. As soon as she came to, she turned to look at the town - to that nightmarish view, stretching out before us.
Question Espella Cantabella (after questioning Storyteller correctly)
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Leads to:
"Excuse me, Espella..."
Layton:
When you say "nightmarish view"...
Darklaw:
I can find no other words to describe it. We froze in terror at the sight. It took us a while to notice that smoke was creeping up the bell tower, too. Our eyes filled up with tears and we couldn't stop crying...perhaps because of the smoke. The town seemed like a fire dragon's playground. I was trembling with terror unlike anything I've known before.
Judge:
Dear me... Merely imagining it now raises the hairs on my beard.
Darklaw:
All strength abandoned us, and we didn't know what to do. That was when we were found by my father and Mr Cantabella.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You didn't leave the belfry until their arrival?
Darklaw:
Of course not. We were paralysed with fear... It was an event so traumatising, it still haunts us. Espella fainted again when she saw the "fire dragon". I was crying and waiting until our fathers found us.
Storyteller:
We went to the bell tower, as it was a good vantage point. We weren't expecting to find our daughters there.
Layton:
Of course, neither suspected at that point that the disaster had been caused by the Bell of Ruin...
Storyteller:
Eve was in tears, sobbing violently. As for Espella...she was in a daze. Her face frozen in an expression of disbelief. She didn't know what was happening around her.
Darklaw:
I cannot say this with certainty, as my memories are a little vague... but I think I was trying to protect her. Maybe not. Perhaps it's just my imagination. At any rate... the only thing I clearly remember is that I couldn't stop crying.
Question Storyteller (if not already questioned)
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Mr Cantabella?
Storyteller:
............ I remember that very well. As if it happened yesterday.
Darklaw:
C-Cantabella...
Layton:
Would you mind telling us what you saw?
Storyteller:
............
Eve! Espella! Are you all right?Daddy! Daddy!Eve! What on earth happened here?It was Bezella! Bezella the witch!B-Bezella? What are you talking about?Bezella comes out whenever someone rings the bell, right?What...what have you done? You didn't...Oh, please, Mr Cantabella! Don't be angry at Espella!............
Storyteller:
Eve said it with a most serious look on her face.
Please, Mr Cantabella! Don't be angry at her!
Storyteller:
When she said that...I grasped the situation. I realised what had transpired in the belfry. And I thought to myself: "I must protect these children."
Darklaw:
............
???:
...E... ...Eve...
Darklaw:
...!
Espella:
I'm so sorry, Eve...
Darklaw:
E-Espella!
Storyteller:
Espella, sweetie...
Espella:
Dad... Please forgive me... You've done all this for me...
Storyteller:
Espella...you're with us again!
Espella:
All this for me... ............
Layton:
Well, well. At last...it would appear we are one step away from the truth.
Phoenix:
Professor! You seem to already know what that truth is...
Layton:
...Do I? That remains to be seen. Continue the interrogation, and we shall all know soon enough.
Judge:
Very well. The court agrees with Inquisitor Layton. Witness, continue your testimony!
Darklaw:
As you wish...
Leads back to cross-examination
Storyteller:
............
Phoenix:
(I feel sorry for Eve... She's seen some scary stuff too.)
Maya:
She may not be showing it, but I bet it's painful for her to talk about all this.
Layton:
I cannot say I don't sympathise with Miss Belduke. However, the truth is our utmost priority. It must be exposed. Even if it may come as a surprise to the witness herself...
Maya:
Huh? You think Ms Belduke isn't aware of the truth?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure what the professor has in mind, but let's trust him on this one. I'm sure we can unravel this mystery together.
Maya:
All righty! Let's do our thing and grasp at straws...I mean, grasp the truth!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Espella...
Espella:
............
Maya:
Espella, are you okay?
Espella:
Y-yes...everything's fine.
Layton:
My apologies for bringing back such troubling memories. Nevertheless...you must endeavour to face them and overcome the power they hold over you.
Espella:
Yes... I...remember it now...
The fire dragon...
I summoned it...because I'm Bezella.
Storyteller:
No, Espella! It was just an illusion!
Espella:
No... You're wrong, Dad. It wasn't an illusion. It was a fact. If I hadn't rung the bell, none of this would have happened. Bezella is the bringer of disaster. And that's what I've done to our town!
...Ack!...The accused's run away!Quick! After her!She's run into the bell tower!Darn it! She's locked herself in!It's no use! We'll have to break down the door to get in!Ugh, that girl! She's gone and Dzibilchaltunchunchucmilled herself!Stay away from me!
The Bell Tower
Phoenix:
Espella!
Maya:
Espella, be careful! It's dangerous up there!
Storyteller:
Please, Espella, come down!
Espella:
I'm sorry, everyone. I...have no right to be here any more.
Maya:
Nick! Espella's going to do something crazy!
Phoenix:
I...I can see that... (...But what the heck can I do?!)
Layton:
Espella! Please, do not make any hasty decisions!
Espella:
Mr Layton...
Layton:
The truth is close now. Be brave for a little while longer...
Espella:
The truth? As if it wasn't [sic] clear already! If I hadn't rung that bell, everything would've been fine...
Layton:
Layton:
You may be mistaken. You still don't know the whole story.
Espella:
Huh?
Layton:
Isn't that so, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
...! (I had the same feeling when I was listening to Eve's testimony... I felt...something was not right.)
Maya:
Really? I thought that was pretty much it!
Layton:
The pieces of the puzzle that don't yet fit are themselves the hints to the solution!
Maya:
N-no way... You mean...Espella didn't ring the bell?
Darklaw:
What?! Nonsense! Of course she did!
Phoenix:
As it stands, it's hard to say for sure that she didn't ring the bell... However! We've got evidence that will clear any doubts.
Darklaw:
Show us this so-called evidence you claim to have then! What do you think proves Espella didn't ring the bell?
Present Top Floor Device
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Espella, can you hear me?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Darklaw:
...What was that? It's so windy that I missed what you just said. It sounded like "Take that!", but I assume I misheard.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Layton:
Oh, I assure you it was just the wind, Miss Belduke. Isn't that so, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Uhm... Yeah. The wind.
Maya:
Looks like they're turning a blind eye to your mistake, Nick... Don't waste their generosity, and get it right next time!
Phoenix:
(What really happened in the belfry when Espella was little... can't be proven with the evidence in the Court Record alone. But that thing in the belfry, along with another piece of evidence, can explain everything!)
Darklaw:
Don't make me laugh! You're as delusional as Espella.
Leads back to:
"Show us this so-called evidence you claim to have then!"
Phoenix:
Espella, can you hear me?
Espella:
Y-yes.
Phoenix:
Where you're standing now is the same spot from where you saw this fire dragon.
Espella:
...! Yes...that's right. This fretwork here is the same as what I saw that day... When I look at it now... it's [sic] seems so small...even adorable.
Darklaw:
Defence! What does this have to do with anything?
Phoenix:
As you will no doubt recall, Mr Cantabella told us that people who drink the groundwater here suffer from a condition... A condition where they fall unconscious the moment they hear the sound of pure silver.
After the bell sounded... you recovered consciousness sooner than Espella. You ran to her side and shook her awake. As soon as she opened her eyes, she saw the fire dragon.
In other words, if it was Espella who rang the bell... that would mean the device for ringing the bell must be very close to the fretwork of the dragon.
Darklaw:
...!
Phoenix:
Espella, can you please check that for me? See if the contraption is located near the dragon fretwork!
Espella:
Uhm...okay. Give me a minute! Mr Wright!
Phoenix:
Espella, did you find it?
Espella:
I don't know if it's the right thing... but there's something on the other side of the belfry. A contraption with a handle...
Darklaw:
Wh-what?! On the other side?
Phoenix:
That's right. I figured there was something weird when we went up the bell tower. But I couldn't quite put my finger on it.
Darklaw:
No...no way...
Phoenix:
You see where I'm going with this, don't you, Ms Belduke? If it was Espella who rang the bell... there's no way she could have seen the "fire dragon" when she woke up!
Darklaw:
Ack! No... No... This can't be right!
Layton:
An excellent deduction, Mr Wright. Miss Darklaw. It seems that everything is now clear as day.
Darklaw:
What...what do you mean...?
Layton:
Why, of course... I mean the answer to the question of who rang the bell.
Darklaw:
It was her...it had to be...
Layton:
What do you say, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
............ It looks like we've arrived at the same conclusion. We now know that only one person could have done it.
Storyteller:
W-wait! What good will saying it out loud do?!
Layton:
Is there a problem, Mr Cantabella? It wasn't your daughter who rang that bell. Should that not lift some burden off your shoulders? Are you not curious to know the name of the true culprit, who has pinned the blame on your daughter all this while?
Storyteller:
Ugh...
Darklaw:
How about you stop taunting us?! Just say the name already! Who is this true culprit?!
Phoenix:
Let's do it, Professor. Are you ready?
Layton:
I am always ready, Mr Wright. It's time to set things straight. The person who rang the bell is...
Present Darklaw profile
Layton:
Have a look!
Leads to:
"It's you, Eve Belduke!"
Present anyone else
Layton:
Have a look!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
W-wait a second, Professor! You know...how can I put this in an inoffensive way... I don't think that's the right person.
Layton:
............ Of course it wasn't that person.
Phoenix:
Wait, what?
Layton:
There's no way it would have been them... I am well aware of that.
Phoenix:
But, then...why did you say their name?
Layton:
Mr Wright, I was merely practising my enunciation.
Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaat?!
Maya:
The professor is one cool customer. And he's never wrong, either!
Phoenix:
(Why does it feel like I'm the one who made a mistake...?)
Layton:
In any case, I'd say we should announce the real culprit's name now!
Leads back to:
"How about you stop taunting us?! Just say the name already!"
It's you, Eve Belduke!
Bell Tower Area
Darklaw:
M-me? But...
Phoenix:
There were only the two of you in the belfry at the time. You know that better than anyone.
Layton:
And as it wasn't Espella who rang the bell... it had to be you.
Darklaw:
That's preposterous... It can't be true...
Layton:
It was an extremely traumatising event for both you and Espella. Your friend's memories were altered from the shock without her even realising it.
She believed she was a witch who rang the bell and summoned a dragon, which incinerated the town. However, Miss Belduke, Espella wasn't the only one whose memories were warped by the horrors you two witnessed. You were affected as well!
Darklaw:
No... It wasn't me... Espella...she rang the bell... It was her, not me...
But...why...? What are these flashbacks...? I've never... I've never had these before...
Anime cutscene
Darklaw:
What's the matter?
Espella:
I don't want to do this now. We'll be taken over by Bezella!
Darklaw:
Bezella is just a fairy tale, and you're the one who said she wanted to come and ring the bell.
Espella:
I did, but I... changed my mind!
Darklaw:
After coming all this way... Espella...Espella!
Espella:
...Bezella.
That nightmare was too much for two young girls to take in. Your young minds needed to protect themselves... That's why you subconsciously repressed those memories.
Darklaw:
Then...if that's true... for the past ten years... I've been pinning the blame... for what I've done, on Espella. It can't be. It can't be true. It's impossible!
Phoenix:
Ah!
Maya:
Darklaw's just disappeared!
Layton:
...She's donned the invisibility robe!
High Inquisitor Darklaw...she's run away!But did you hear that? It was her that once destroyed this town!Our lives have already been messed up so much! We don't need this now!She's got to pay for what she did! Capture her!
The Bell Tower
Maya:
Oh! Nick, look at the bell tower! Espella's gone!
Phoenix:
No! She's on the roof!
Espella:
I beg you! Don't blame Eve! It really doesn't matter any more who rang the accursed bell! This town was all created for me! It's my fault you've all been used, and suffered so much!
Storyteller:
E-Espella! What are you saying?! Please, come down right now! You haven't done anything wrong! It was all my fault!
Espella:
Dad, I know that you did this for me. You've been so kind to me, and what did I do? I selfishly ran away from home...
Storyteller:
Espella...
Espella:
I will finish your Story for you. The evil witch will be gone forever, and everyone will live happily ever after. Dad...thank you for everything you've done for me.
Anime cutscene
Storyteller:
Wait! Don't do it, Espella!
Espella:
What are you...?
Luke:
Isn't that...D-Darklaw?!
Espella:
But...why, Eve? Why would you...? I finally remembered everything I've done...
Darklaw:
You're not the only one who remembered. You still have the pendant...
Espella:
Yes, of course. That's because... somehow I always knew it was important to me.
Darklaw:
Espella...
Espella:
You kept your pendant as well, didn't you, Eve?
Darklaw:
For some reason... I just couldn't let it go.
Rendered cutscene
Phoenix:
Espella...Ms Darklaw!
Maya:
Quick! They'll fall if we don't do something!
Phoenix:
Let's go! We have to save them!
Storyteller:
No, you won't make it there in time!
Maya:
Why...?
Storyteller:
The wooden handrail Eve's holding on to is rotted through! We'd need some sort of magic to save them!
Maya:
No way!
Layton:
Magic, you say?
Phoenix:
Got an idea, Professor?
Layton:
If a bit of magic is all that's needed to save these two young ladies... then perhaps that is something I can arrange.
Phoenix:
What?! You can?!
Anime cutscene
Espella:
Eve... You have to let go! Otherwise, you'll fall too!
Phoenix:
Professor?
Bell Tower Area
Phoenix:
Wh-what's going on here? Anyone?
Maya:
P-Professor! You're a sorcerer!
Layton:
No, Miss Fey. We have already established that magic doesn't exist, even in this town.
Phoenix:
But then, how did you just do that?
Layton:
What you have just seen... was the last, and greatest, illusion within Labyrinthia!
Phoenix:
Huh? An illusion?
Layton:
Magic is but an illusion. And this illusion has been produced through the power of suggestion and Labrelum's...medication. Everyone in Labyrinthia has been under this particular "magic spell". Now then, shall we break the spell?
Phoenix:
("Magic" is the last mystery to be solved...)
Storyteller:
You've seen through all my tricks, Layton...
Layton:
I wouldn't have done it without the vital hint you gave me when we spoke in your tower. "The final spell is concealed at the start."
Phoenix:
Okay...so what does that mean?
Layton:
As you know, all the spells are listed within this book.
Maya:
Right...the Grand Grimoire!
Layton:
Now, what did Mr Cantabella mean by the start?
Phoenix:
The...front cover?
Layton:
Precisely, Mr Wright. The final spell shall dispel the illusion. The correct incantation is hidden on the front cover itself. Well then, Mr Wright. This is the final puzzle. Soon a new day will begin for the townspeople. Let us put an end to this illusion, once and for all!
Phoenix:
Yeah!

Anime cutscene
Layton:
The sun is rising, and when it does... its light will reveal the truth behind Labyrinthia's mysteries.
Phoenix:
Now, Professor?
Layton:
Yes. Shall we, Mr Wright?
Phoenix/Layton:
Taelende!
Phoenix:
So this is...the real "magic" behind Labyrinthia...
Layton:
Excellent work, my boy!
Maya:
Hey, it's Luke!
Phoenix:
Hang on a second! The town's full of machinery?!
Maya:
So much for magic. It was all done with these machines!
Storyteller:
That's right. With magic, witches can fly, buildings can disappear... Those are no easy feats to stage. To make all those incredible things real, we needed a great deal of machinery.
Phoenix:
(Couldn't he have just, I dunno, made the magic a bit simpler?)
Layton:
A "witch" would say the incantation, and Shades would "stop time" with their silver bells.
Maya:
And they'd go wild with these machines, making all sorts of crazy stuff happen! That's so cool. I'd love to try it!
Luke:
I took a quick crash course before operating the machines! Not bad, hey?
Layton:
Yes, Luke. What would we do without you?
Maya:
So, when's my turn? I wanna pick something up off the ground and make it fly through the air!
Phoenix:
...I wish you'd stop looking at me when you say that, Maya.
Layton:
Well... In any case, I think we should head back to the courthouse.
Maya:
Right you are, Professor! The judge might have fallen asleep waiting for us!
Special Court
Judge:
The sun has risen above Labyrinthia and has shown us our town's true form. Well, I really don't think there is any need for a verdict any more. The witches on trial weren't witches after all. I am deeply relieved that those I have sentenced are still alive and well. At last, I can step down from this seat with a clear conscience. And now... the final verdict in the last Witches' Court session ever to be held...
Not Guilty
Bell Tower Area
Phoenix:
I'm very grateful for all the help, Professor.
Layton:
The feeling is mutual, Mr Wright. A gentleman always fights for the truth. I could not have done otherwise.
Judge:
I'd like to congratulate the two of you. You both did splendidly in the court.
Maya:
Oh! It's the judge!
Judge:
You've brought to light the truth about this town... although I still find it astonishing that we could not see all of this. I cannot even begin to imagine how it was achieved...
Storyteller:
You were all given a very simple instruction when you were hypnotised. "You cannot see pure black." That was sufficient.
Judge:
Oh, now I see! These strange contraptions are made from some sort of black metal...
Luke:
Wait just a second! There are plenty of black objects all over Labyrinthia, aren't there?!
Maya:
Yeah, that's right! My hair's charcoal black, too!
Layton:
...Ah, but it is not pure black.
Luke:
Whaaat...?
Layton:
What we often perceive as the colour black is in fact far from being "pure black". Our brains interpret reflections of light as colours. Objects which reflect even the smallest amount of light are not pure black.
Storyteller:
Pure black is only encountered within nature as darkness.
Luke:
Darkness, sir?
Storyteller:
The machines used in Labyrinthia are coated in a special material developed by Labrelum Inc. It absorbs light without reflecting any. It is the only material that can be said to be pure black.
Maya:
Oh! I bet this invisibility robe is also made of that same material, right?
Storyteller:
That's correct. And of course, the bell tower was concealed using the very same material as well.
Layton:
............ When you think about it... this town abounds in all things invisible.
Maya:
Huh?
Layton:
Miss Darklaw...or should I say Miss Belduke...
Darklaw:
Y-yes...?
Layton:
For ten long years, your memories had been suppressed.
Darklaw:
The truth about what occurred in the belfry was invisible to me, you mean?
Layton:
Mr Cantabella and your father knew it all along. They knew who actually rang the bell.
Darklaw:
What? Did they really... Is that true, Cantabella?
Storyteller:
............
Layton:
As we have demonstrated, it was easy to deduce from the situation in the belfry.
Darklaw:
But if he knew that all along, why didn't he say something...?
Layton:
It was, of course, for your own good.
...Don't be angry at her!
Storyteller:
You were trying to pin the blame for that disaster on Espella...
Darklaw:
Yes, I was! But if you knew that, why did you keep quiet about it...? If you had only scolded me back then for lying... maybe Espella wouldn't have suffered such trauma!
Storyteller:
............ It was...your eyes, Eve.
Darklaw:
What?
Storyteller:
Your eyes weren't those of a liar. You believed in what you said. You truly thought it was Espella. What you saw was too much for you to bear. Your mind blocked out the real memory of what happened in order to maintain your own sanity.
Had I called you a liar then...
Layton:
You would probably have suffered a mental breakdown.
Darklaw:
Ah!
Layton:
Mr Cantabella and your father created this town. You were mistaken in thinking it was purely for Espella's sake. It was also for you, Miss Belduke.
Darklaw:
Argh...
Layton:
Remember what your father wrote in his suicide note.
I have only two concerns. The first is my daughter. It pains me to be leaving her alone in this world... Although she probably doesn't think of me as her father.
Darklaw:
............ I had an argument with my father once. He was always thinking only about the town and paid no attention to me...
Storyteller:
So you moved out and broke off contact with him... But you were wrong about your father. Not a single day passed without him thinking about you. He helped to make the Story I was weaving a reality, for your sake.
Darklaw:
............ I've been so ignorant. I was so convinced Father was driven to suicide by you...
Layton:
Your father couldn't bear the sense of guilt he had accumulated over the past ten years. Even though he killed himself in the end, I believe you were always the most important person to him.
Darklaw:
............
???:
Um...
Espella:
Eve...?
Darklaw:
Espella! ............ Espella, what I did to you is unforgivable. I rewrote your Story, putting you through all this... I can't believe I went to such an extreme because of one wrong assumption!
Espella:
No, it's okay, Eve. I wasn't angry.
Darklaw:
You weren't?
Espella:
You've always been on my side. Protecting me. And even today...you saved my life.
Darklaw:
Espella...
Espella:
I also owe you an apology. After all...I forgot about my dearest friend. I'm so sorry, Eve.
Eve:
...Meow.
Espella:
Ah, there you are, Eve! Where were you, hmm?
Darklaw:
Ahh... Your cat's called Eve?
Espella:
Eh hehe. You know what I've just noticed? You two are very much alike. You and Eve the cat.
Darklaw:
Wh-what...? It's all in your head.
Eve:
Meow.
Luke:
It looks like Eve has taken a liking to the other Eve!
Maya:
You've got that right! And the similarity is really striking!
Eve:
...Meow.
Darklaw:
Oh dear...
Storyteller:
My accidental guests, Professor Layton and Mr Wright.
Layton:
Yes?
Storyteller:
I must say, I am indebted to you.
Phoenix:
Ah, don't mention it.
Darklaw:
You know, when I started planning my revenge three months ago... Mr Layton was a part of my plans. I needed to lure him to Labyrinthia.
Layton:
Why me?
Darklaw:
You were famous in London, and word of your skills reached me even here. What's more, you specialise in mysteries... So I thought that if you came to this town, you'd feel compelled to solve ours.
Layton:
Ha, well...I am honoured.
Phoenix:
That's cool. And...what about me?
Darklaw:
Ah...well. About you... Err, how should I put it... Your arrival here was purely accidental.
Phoenix:
You mean it wasn't planned?
Darklaw:
As you know, Espella escaped and got involved in that incident on the freighter. As a consequence, I had no choice but to bring you here.
Phoenix:
I see. (I shouldn't have asked...  My fragile pride has suffered yet another blow.)
Maya:
Nick, you can't escape your fate. You're doomed to always find trouble, if it doesn't find you first!
Phoenix:
(How about some words of sympathy for a change?)
Darklaw:
I am terribly sorry. The only thing on my mind the last three months was revenge.
Storyteller:
Whatever your intentions were, the last witch trial has ended in the best possible way for this town. You were correct in your judgement. You always are.
Darklaw:
You're too kind to me...
Storyteller:
I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Eve. For opening my eyes.
Maya:
Sorry to break up this little happy ending, but... I've sorta got an important question. Why were you going to end the Story?
Storyteller:
............ Only Newton knew the real reason... I am suffering from an incurable illness.
Phoenix:
Wh-what...?
Espella:
D-Dad! You're ill? I-is it serious?
Storyteller:
It is a rare disease with no known cure.
Darklaw:
Why didn't you tell me?! Had I known...
Storyteller:
I wanted this to be my secret. I suppose that was a bad decision on my part. I thought I'd finish the Story before I died and lay the foundations for a new world. Honestly, I was desperate. I didn't much care about Labyrinthia any more.
Espella:
Dad...why did it have to happen to you?! Especially now that we're finally back together...
Storyteller:
Cheer up, Espella.
Espella:
How can I?
Storyteller:
Labrelum's new drug development centre contacted me a short while ago. They have succeeded in creating a new medicine, thanks to Belduke's research. It's a top secret wonder drug for my illness.
Darklaw:
A wonder drug?
Storyteller:
Newton had been working on finding a cure for my illness until the very end. It would seem that the cure was his final gift to me.
Darklaw:
...! My father...
Storyteller:
Newton was the truest friend I ever had. I'm going to undergo surgery. Do not fear, I shall return. So stop making that sad face, Espella.
Espella:
............ Dad...will everything be back to how it once was?
Storyteller:
Of course it will.
Espella:
And, Eve...will you...will you still be my friend?
Darklaw:
............ Of course.* (voice-over only)
Espella:
Thank you!* (voice-over only)
Espella:
I'm going to drop by Mrs Eclaire's bakery. I've got so much to tell her! Do you mind if I go, Dad? It won't take long.
Storyteller:
Of course not. Please do.
Espella:
Looks like Eve wants to come too!
Darklaw:
What? Oh... You meant the cat...
Eve:
Meow.
Maya:
Espella, mind if we tag along?
Espella:
Not at all! You're welcome to come!
Maya:
Awesome! Maybe we'll get some tasty baked bread out of this!
Luke:
Uhm...I thought we were going there for a different reason... Well anyway, I'll be off then, Professor.
Layton:
Pass on my regards to Mrs Eclaire, Luke.
Phoenix:
So, uhm... What's going to happen to the town?
Storyteller:
I've released everyone from hypnosis. They will soon recover the memories of their lives before Labyrinthia. As of today, Project Labyrinthia is over.
Layton:
Ah, I see.
Storyteller:
They are free to leave, if they so wish. I imagine they will make a run for it... This place will turn into uninhabited ruins, just like it was ten years ago.
???:
I have some doubts about that.
Phoenix:
Y-Your Honour!
Judge:
I now understand that this town is an artificial creation of yours. Nonetheless... To us Labyrinthians, the past ten years were real.
Storyteller:
............
Layton:
No one can yet tell how this town will change. However, it is possible... that some people will want to stay. Who knows, perhaps you will find yourself creating a new town along with them.
Storyteller:
A new town, you say...?
Judge:
I am no longer the judge. But, if possible... I would like to remain here.
Storyteller:
............ You have my gratitude, Your Honour.
Judge:
You need not address me as "Your Honour" any more, "Sir Storyteller".
Storyteller:
...Heh.
Phoenix:
Whew...and so... the last witch trial has drawn to a close.
If clearing for the first time
What did Mr Wright, Mr Layton and my father talk about? That, I do not know. But...Dad made a promise to me. Once everyone recovers their memories and he is cured of his illness... he will return to write a new story, with everyone's help. This time... the story will be real, without any lies or illusions.

If clearing on all subsequent times
What did Wright, Layton and Cantabella talk about? I do not know, and there's no need for me to know. Whatever it was, Cantabella made a promise to me and Espella afterwards. He said he would restore everyone's memories and wrap up Labyrinthia's story. He would fight to recover from his illness and undoubtedly return to this town. I have the utmost trust in my father's research results. What he discovered is certain to work. I know this better than anyone. And then, a new story will begin for the town of Labyrinthia. It will be real this time, not built on deception. When I read my father's last letter, I remembered his face. He was smiling, like always. That's how I will forever remember him. Today I learned that I have always been looked after and protected. By Cantabella...and by my father. Now that I know the real cause of my father's suicide...I've decided to change. This is the dawn of a new story for me, as well.

Maya:
What a beautiful sound.
Layton:
Almost as if it's ringing in a new beginning for the town.
Espella:
Thank you, Eve...
Layton:
Okay, then... whenever you are ready, Mr Barnham.
Espella:
Thank you! Thank you all so much for everything!
Maya:
Espella, you take care now!
Luke:
You too, Mr Cantabella! Bye!
Espella:
Be sure to visit us again!
Phoenix:
You can bet on it!
Layton:
I wish all of you the very best!
Townspeople:
Goodbye!
Layton:
Mr Wright... I knew I could count on you, to stand your ground and fight me to the very end.
Phoenix:
Me too... I always believed in you, Professor. And I know that's why we managed to get to the mysterious truth behind this town.
Maya:
When we get back to England, we'll drop by and see you, Luke.
Luke:
Great! I'll show you around London!
Layton's Office
Luke:
You know, Professor, I feel like I've just finished reading a really long story.
Layton:
Indeed, Luke, I know what you mean. It certainly was an enthralling adventure.
Luke:
I wonder how Espella and the others back in Labyrinthia are getting on... I'd love to go back and see them. Although I'd rather not have to be sucked into a book to get there...
Layton:
Perhaps we should ask Carmine to come along with us.
Luke:
Great! It's a real relief he recovered from all of his injuries! ...But he was a bit put out when he found out you'd already solved all the town's secrets, Professor!
Layton:
Ha ha ha... Well, we mustn't forget that we didn't solve them all by ourselves... We couldn't have done it without the help of our friends across the Atlantic.
Luke:
I wonder what they're doing right now... Battling away in a courtroom somewhere?
Layton:
I'd wager they may well be, Luke. At any rate, we must make our own preparations. There's a brand new case that requires our attention... And that means a brand new set of puzzles to be solved, my boy.

Edgeworth:
What's the matter, Wright? Has the cat got your tongue?
Phoenix:
Ugh...
Edgeworth:
Or are you still in a holiday kind of mood? Perhaps your mind is as clouded as the English sky...
Phoenix:
Um... Any hints, Maya?
Maya:
Not really. If only the professor were here... I think at this point you've gotta use that patented "spell" of yours, Nick!
Phoenix:
Patented spell?
Maya:
Helloooo, Earth to Nick?! Just when we think it's all over, you always use it to turn the tables!
Phoenix:
...Ah, got it. I just have to close my eyes and say the "magic" word... Luckily, I don't need a witch's sceptre for this one... Heh.
Edgeworth:
Save the chit-chat for later, Wright. I've almost missed that utterly annoying "spell" of yours... Fine. Let's hear it then.

"Just take a deep breath and give it all you've got!"

Well, well, well! Thought you could get rid of me that easily, did you?!

Well, here goes...

MYSTERY SOLVED
The Great Witch Bezella
The Great Witch Bezella was a fictional character created by the Storyteller to protect the young Espella from trauma. This spawned the many mysteries that followed.
They no longer need Bezella, nor the witches or witchcraft that were essential for her existence.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That testimony clearly contradicts this piece of evidence!
Judge:
I have no idea how... And here's your penalty.
Phoenix:
Arrghhhhhhhh! P-Professor...I could really use a hand!
Layton:
Regrettably, Mr Wright, I cannot oblige your request.
Phoenix:
Why not...?
Layton:
A gentleman must play the game fair and square, would you not agree?
Phoenix:
(Ughhh... Apparently gentlemen make for pretty cold-hearted prosecutors.)
Layton:
I am, after all, a gentleman.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That testimony clearly contradicts this piece of evidence!
Judge:
That's rather hopeless. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
It's...hopeless?
Judge:
Yes, defender. Hopeless. That which lacks hope. Much like the accused's fate. And here is the punishment to match such a performance.
Phoenix:
(I could've done without the definition... or the insult, for that matter...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
There is a serious contradiction in that last statement!
Judge:
Unfortunately, you appear to be mistaken.
Phoenix:
Gaaaaah! (Ugh... Yeah, it looks like I was wrong.)
Layton:
Ah, Mr Wright. Speaking of mistakes, that reminds me of a puzzle...
Judge:
...I understand that puzzle-solving is a wonderful pastime, but please indulge in it after this trial.
Layton:
Ah, yes. My apologies.
Phoenix:
(Are you trying to make me feel worse, Professor...?)
Question Espella Cantabella incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Espella?
Espella:
............
Phoenix:
Um, hello? Espella?
Espella:
Oh! Yes? What is it?
Phoenix:
Regarding the testimony we've just heard... Is there anything you'd like to say about it?
Espella:
............ I'm sorry, Mr Wright. I'm not sure about anything at all...
Phoenix:
(Something's blocking out her memories... Maybe trying to force them back all at once isn't the best thing for her... I've got no choice now but to trust the professor and keep on going.)
Judge:
Well then, let's carry on. Witness, continue testifying!
Question Storyteller incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Mr Storyteller?
Storyteller:
............ I am no longer the Storyteller. I am...Arthur Cantabella.
Phoenix:
The president of Labrelum Inc., a pharmaceutical company...yes, I know.
Storyteller:
That's my true identity.
Phoenix:
Okay. So, Mr Cantabella, is there anything in the testimony we've just heard that you'd like to expand on?
Storyteller:
No, there is nothing to add.
Phoenix:
Are you really sure about that? The expression on your face indicated otherwise.
Storyteller:
I'm afraid you are mistaken.
Phoenix:
............ By the way, I wanted to tell you I'm a big fan of Labrelum's flu syrup. The slogan's kind of catchy, too.
Storyteller:
"Hey, you! You, with the flu! Labrelum that illness and feel good as new!" ...I wrote that one.
Layton:
If I may interrupt... This small talk is irrelevant to the trial and probably of little interest to Mr Cantabella, the company president.
Judge:
That's right. And now, witness, continue testifying!
Question Darklaw incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Ms Darklaw...
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
Would you like to comment on the testimony we've just heard?
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
It seemed like something in it attracted your attention...
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
(I guess whatever I say, she'll just stand there going "..." with her eyes closed.)
Maya:
Darklaw doesn't make a great witness, does she?
Phoenix:
............
Maya:
Don't you "..." me!
Judge:
Well then, witness, continue testifying!
Too many penalties
Judge:
There is no need to continue this trial. The accused's true identity has been proven beyond doubt. The court shall now issue the final verdict for Espella Cantabella!
Guilty
Judge:
It is a crime to be a witch. We must do everything to erase magic from the world. Despicable witch! Into the flames with you!
