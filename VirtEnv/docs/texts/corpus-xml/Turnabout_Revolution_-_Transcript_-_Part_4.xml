<title>Turnabout Revolution</title>
<line speaker="Athena">It's complete chaos outside.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Let's just say the Defiant Dragons supporters demonstrating for Dhurke's freedom... ...have taken a very special interest in the outcome of today's trial.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">They look about ready to string us up if we lose...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Trials here are pretty much like the ones back home, but with one major difference: The Divination Séance. The victim's final memories will become a matter for deliberation.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I've heard about that. But they haven't stopped you from winning your cases here in Khura'in.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">True, but it wasn't easy. Still, the memories of the dead are simply another piece of evidence. There's always a way to deal with them if your client is truly innocent.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Well, I know Dhurke is innocent, but...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">I have one more... big secret.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with a truth that is difficult to accept. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Dhurke... What is that secret you're keeping?</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Heya, AJ.</line>
<line speaker="Datz">Here ya go, just like I promised.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Thanks, Datz. Wait... Weren't you arrested by the police yesterday?</line>
<line speaker="Datz">Yep. And I spent the night in the slammer. I had a fine meal, a shower -- even a bed! What more could I ask for? Har har har har!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">That actually sounds way better than where we're staying...</line>
<line speaker="Datz">Just remember, AJ, if Dhurke's found guilty today... ...we'll all probably be found guilty under the Defense Culpability Act, too.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Yeah, Nahyuta said something to that effect.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Datz">That witch Ga'ran wants to take advantage of today to crush our revolution once and for all! The fate of the revolution -- and every Khura'inese person -- rests on this trial! We're counting on ya, AJ!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">We'll be fine! I'm going to win this one. You'll see!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The trial will begin shortly, Apollo. Let's make our way into the courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Right!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let the trial of Dhurke Sahdmadhi begin.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The defense is ready, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">The prosecution is ready, Your Magistry.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>...So it's really come down to this. Well, don't expect me to hold anything back, Nahyuta!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">This trial will examine both the murder of Justice Minister Inga Karkhuul Khura'in... ...and the assassination of the former queen, Amara Sigatar Khura'in. First, I believe we should address the murder of Minister Inga. Would that be acceptable, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">........................</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">! Y-Yes, of course. Please proceed.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>What's with him?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">How very unlike you, prosecutor. Is your mind elsewhere this day?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...N-Not at all, Your Magistry.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Are you really going to be able to go through with this, Nahyuta...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Well, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, I would be remiss if I failed to voice a concern of mine. I have heard mention that you are son to the accused, Dhurke Sahdmadhi.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........You have heard true. Does that fact pose some sort of a problem, Your Magistry?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A father being prosecuted by his own son? Could one possibly deliberate such a case without having personal feelings intervene?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........Yes, without question.</line>
<line speaker="Gallery">Can he really handle this?Even if it IS Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, going against his own father is just...How can the son of a criminal even BE a prosecutor in the first place?</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">...Fellow citizens, you would do well not to underestimate my son. He's not one to allow personal feelings to interfere with the execution of his duty. Isn't that right, Nahyuta?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...! ...I will not stop until my work here is done.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">See? So all you doubters just sit back down before you trip over your own stupidity! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The accused will not take the stand without first being summoned! In any case, if Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has no issue with this arrangement... ...then let us commence the deliberations.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-Your Eminence?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Your Eminence! What brings you here?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Your Magistry. It would appear that Prosecutor Shadmadhi does indeed have some reservations.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">No! That's not true!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Did you truly believe you could deceive me... Nahyuta Sahdmadhi? One should hold no reservations if one is to stand on these hallowed funerary grounds.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">I-I... I have none, Your Emine--</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">No, it is clear we cannot leave this matter to you.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Nngh!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">We shall handle the prosecution of Enemy of the Crown Dhurke Sahdmadhi personally. But remain by our side, and bear witness to how a true prosecutor enforces the law.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um... Excuse me... but is the queen going to prosecute the case? Is that you know... um... kosher?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...There is no need for concern. Before we were crowned queen, we served as a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Really?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">As a foreigner, your ignorance can be excused, but know this... The prosecutor in charge of the Queen Amara assassination case twenty-three years ago... ... was none other than Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>First, "Your Magistry," and now this... Why doesn't anyone ever tell me these things...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'd heard she'd served as the Minister of Justice, but she was also a prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I'm guessing she probably moved up the ladder from prosecutor to Justice Minister.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">We prosecuted that case twenty-three years ago, but no verdict was ever rendered. We had won guilty verdicts in every case until then, for no lawyer could stand up to us.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ahh, I am at a loss for words. To think I would once more bear witness to Her Eminence at work in the Hall of Justice.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">......... Our first trial in twenty-three years... No quarter shall be given to criminals. We shall prosecute them with all our might!</line>
<line speaker="Gallery">...Ohhh!What a magnificent sight!The queen's attire from her prosecutor days! To think we would get to see it once more!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What the--?! TH-THAT'S Queen Ga'ran?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Talk about an extreme makeover.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Heh heh heh. It's all coming back now. The feel of my blood pumping through my veins. Woe to you, O enemies of Khura'in, for I shall personally slice, dice... ...and grind you up into hog feed!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>I don't suppose I can ask her to roll back to her polite, pre-makeover personality...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Know this, lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Y-Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Now that I stand as prosecutor, consider your defense's bench a headsman's scaffold. If you wish to leave any last words, I advise you to start thinking of them now. ...While you still have a head with which to think, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Meep. <thought>Sh-She's dead serious.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Now, it is time for the Divination Séance. Rayfa, come forth.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your Benevolence, thank you for gracing us with your presence.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">........................</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Your Benevolence? I understand it may be difficult for you, but... ...may we proceed with the Divination Séance?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">............Yes, let us proceed.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Forgive me for asking, but are you feeling physically unwell? If so, I would advise you to avoid any undue exertion.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........Um-hmm.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Your Benevolence?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>What's wrong? It's like her mind's anywhere but here.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A lot's happened since yesterday. On top of the murder of her beloved father, she found out that he'd been planning a coup. And today she'll have to experience his death through his own eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yeah... That would be enough to shake anyone up.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Still, it seems like she's worse off today than she was yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...............</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Yeah... I don't remember her being this depressed...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...We must speak with our child. It is a mother's duty to discipline her child, after all. Now, if you would excuse us.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Discipline? Coming from her, I don't like the sound of that at all...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Wait... Ga'ran didn't do something to her, did she?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your Eminence, about today's Divination Séance... As I understand it, the prosecution has yet to review its content. Is this deviation from protocol a part of your plan?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Would you care to explain your actions?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Your Eminence... The accused was caught at the scene of the crime. Therefore, I deemed no Séance would be necessary for such a clear-cut case.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...You and your bleeding heart. You seek to spare Rayfa the trauma of witnessing her father's death... Is that why you have done this?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...N-Not at all.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........You were concerned for me, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? </line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>That's oddly compassionate of him, all things considered.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Your Eminence, Your Magistry. Regardless of what is best for Her Benevolence... ...this case is blessed with a bounty of incontrovertible evidence. So I believed we can reach a swift verdict without devoting precious time to a Séance.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... You have a point. Personally, I would like to spare Her Benevolence any undue misery. Experiencing the murder of a loved one is a burden no one should have to bear.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, Your Magistry. Can this trial truly proceed without a Divination Séance?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>I can't blame her for not wanting to experience her father's murder firsthand...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your Eminence? What are your feelings on the matter? Shall we have Her Benevolence return home for some much-needed rest?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........We shall not. You fools spoil her with your feckless words of compassion.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Ngh...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Listen well, Rayfa. You have spoken time and time again about how grown up you are now.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Y-Yes, but...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">So, let us see if the royal priestess has truly come into her own. Are you prepared to fulfill your duty and perform the Divination Séance as you should?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.....................Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">That's better. See. Problem solved.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Poor Rayfa. Is this really a good idea?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I guess we'll see...</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...Very well. Let us begin... the Divination Séance. Nayna, my robe... .........Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Looks like Nayna's still missing.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>It's been a whole day already.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........Barbed Head.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">You remove my robe.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What?! Why me?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Don't keep Her Benevolence waiting now, Mr. Wright. Can't you see she's ready to begin?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Great. I've been reduced to "royal robe remover."</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>It's like she's grooming Mr. Wright to be Nayna's replacement...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, Your Benevolence. Please start when you are ready.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........Ngh...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Come, Rayfa. You know what must be done. There is no turning back now.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">..................I know.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>The final memories of the deceased... This should be interesting.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination Séance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Haggh! I. I... I... Ah... Auunngh!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.................. *huff, puff* *huff, puff* .........*gasp!*</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-Y-Your Benevolence! Wh-What's wrong?!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Th-This is... unacceptable!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-Bailiff! Take Her Benevolence to the first-aid station at once!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">This is not good...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">....Your Eminence, do you have any idea why Her Benevolence collapsed so suddenly?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...It seems she was not ready for what the deceased was to reveal. It overwhelmed her. Her inexperience and immaturity left her ill-prepared to face her father's death. Hmph. And she said she could go through with it. How very disappointing. </line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>I know someone who's not winning "Mother of the Yeah," ever. I mean, of course Rayfa's going to be overwhelmed. She's still just a child!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...It seems we have no choice but to move on to witness testimony. Your Magistry?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh, yes. Let us proceed. Bailiff, summon the first witness, if you would.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Is this not the accused?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">It is indeed. I thought I would give him the opportunity to plead his case. For true justice is more than a unilateral presentation of the facts by the prosecution.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>That seems uncharacteristically fair of her.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">However, should the accused fail to produce convincing testimony... ...he, along with his cabal of traitorous lawyers, shall immediately be found guilty... ...and their heads will roll from their shoulders.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">WHAAAAAAT?! I should've known there was a catch!</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Your court, your rules -- same as it always was, I see, Ga'ran.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, then, Mr. Dhurke Sahdmadhi. If you could enlighten us as to what happened?</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Um, well... I would... if I could...</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">I was struck by a sudden dizziness the moment I entered the tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............ <thought>That didn't explain squat.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">For the record, let it be known... ... that the accused's fingerprints were all over the murder weapon. And since he was caught in the act, there was no chance for a third party to tamper with it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, that certainly seems to point the finger at you, Mr. Sahdmadhi.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Even as a lawyer, I have to agree with you there, Your Magistry. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Seriously, Dhurke? This is no laughing matter.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This is exactly what Ga'ran wanted. To have Dhurke try to plead his case, only to fail miserably.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">How low can she go...?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Prosecutor, behold this most unpleasant of spectacles and let it be etched into your soul. See how instead of accepting the inevitable... ...those fish-brained lawyers flounder and flop themselves straight into the abyss of despair.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Yes, Your Eminence! Show me the way!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, then, would the defense please begin their cross-examination?</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">I was struck by a sudden dizziness the moment I entered the tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Can't say that it has. Maybe age is catching up with me. I'm no spring chicken, after all!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>That's not the issue here.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hmph. A most cunning excuse. One befitting an insidious insurgent.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">A killer who does not recall his crime... How very convenient. Next, I imagine you will plead insanity. You aim to seek a lesser sentence through excuses and subterfuge, do you not?</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Dhurke:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">How dare you!</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">I'm merely stating my innocence. I've no intention of offering excuses. It's your baseless speculation I would decry as foolish... ...you deceitful witch.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Is it your wish that I should claim your head right now, in this very hall?</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Well, that would certainly speed things along, hah-ha ha ha ha ha!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hmph. Next time you have an objection, you'd better have some proof to go with it, Dhurke.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The accused will continue with what he DOES recall of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Wish I could say I did, but I don't remember a thing from before I came to. You think there might have been a third party in the tomb, son?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yeah, because if you didn't do it, then the real killer must've been there with you.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">You called, Your Eminence?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Does she go anywhere without those goons?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Was there a third party in the tomb when you were securing it?</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">No, Your Eminence. We searched hiiiiigh and low, but found no one of the sooooooort!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...And there you have it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh, right. They did search the place.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Furthermore... ...my guards had the entire tomb surrounded, so there was no way for anyone to escape.</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">That's right! No one got in or out without our knowledge! Her Eminence's on-site directives were absolutely flaaawless! Ur dihara Ga'ran!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Argh.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Do you see now? The presence of a third party is beyond the realm of possibility. The tomb was, for all intents and purposes... ...completely sealed off from the rest of the world.</line>
<line speaker="Gallery">What a waste of time.How can it be any more obvious? Dhurke must be the killer.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Thanks for nothing, gallery guy. As if our graves weren't already deep enough.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Accused. What do you believe about the possible presence of a third party?</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Hmm... Well, based on the situation you presented... ...I'd say the chances are slim to none.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......... <thought>You didn't have to agree with her, Dhurke...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Heh heh heh. Let the accused's statement be added to his testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Mr. Sahdmadhi, if you would...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's like, the more we press, the thinner our case gets.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, let's keep pressing, and maybe we'll work out the wrinkles in it, too.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Find the possible in the impossible, son. That's just what a lawyer's got to do sometimes. Isn't that right... Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Who, me? ...Yeah, you could say that. I've seen more than my fair share of trials like that... They'd start with no viable evidence, useful testimony, or any hope of winning... But through cold sweat, desperation, and a little luck, I always managed to pull them off.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">...Wright. I can see we are kindred spirits, you and I! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Jeez, taking cases like that must shave years off your life.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ha ha ha. If that were true, I'd be long dead.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Find the possible in the impossible? Can I prove that it was at least possible that there was a third party there?</thought> Dhurke, what did you see at the scene of the crime?</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Let's see, I came to...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">And lying right in front of me was Inga, dead as a doornail.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">It's pretty easy to spot the difference between a soulless man and the soulless shell of a man. His complexion and the amount of blood at the scene made it obvious which it was.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hmph. Watch your words, or you shall join Minister Inga much sooner than expected. You can bow your head before him and seek his forgiveness there in the Twilight Realm. ...If you still have a head to bow, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">You bloodthirsty spider. What happened to you? There was still a little love in your heart twenty-three years ago. You even used to think of me as a brother.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">........It seems you truly do have a death wish.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Is that really all you've got?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Dhurke, I'm begging you... Enough of the lip -- just deliver your testimony. Please.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">All right, all right. I'll try, but I can't promise anything.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">I've no recollection of what happened in the interim.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">My memory is a complete blank. It's as if that part of my brain has been scooped right out.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">How very convenient. But even if you've no memory of the event, your guilt is without question. There is nothing more to debate.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">You're forgetting one thing, Ga'ran. I have no motive.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">You lead a band of insurgents that seeks to overthrow the government. I would say that alone is motive enough to slay our kingdom's minister of justice.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Dhurke:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>A bloodless revolution... He wouldn't really have a motive, in that case. Is that an important statement?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That was an important statement. I'd like my client to add it to his testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, then. The accused will please do as the defense has requested.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">I don't have a motive for killing Inga. After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">I'm talking about dragging this pompous prosecutor here off her bloody throne. So go ahead, Ga'ran, act all high and mighty now, because it's the last chance you'll get.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">You still speak of rebellion despite the charges against you? You truly are a fool. I will prove your guilt soon enough, and display your head for all of Khura'in to see. People will forever speak of you -- not as a revolutionary, but as the terrorist you are. </line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">You're mistaken, Your Maleficence. It will be YOU the people will speak of... ...as the tyrant who was overthrown by her own people.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........I wonder if you will still be spewing such nonsense before the headsman's axe?</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I'm afraid I'll still be like this in the afterlife, despot!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>I know that self-restraint is as foreign as apple pie to Dhurke, but... ...I'd really rather go home than to the Twilight Realm after this.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">How can I, when I have no memory of what happened?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, can you at least state whether or not you are a murderer?</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">That, I can do. I am not a murderer. And I would never kill anyone, no matter the circumstances.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Evidence? No. Can't say I do...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">In that case, you sill strike the statement "I didn't kill him" from your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wait. You can't just discard testimony like that. I mean... I'm the one cross-examining the defendant and all...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hold your prattling tongue, foreign devil! I am the queen of this kingdom. And the queen IS the law. As such, I need not follow the laws that are in place. I can make and break them at will! </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Henceforth, the accused will refrain from stating "I didn't kill him."</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Whaaaaaat?!</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Sure. Whatever. It's "The Ga'ran Show," after all. Same as always.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Though, I guess there's no evidence that proves I didn't kill him either...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">All right. I'll stick to the facts from now on. But remember, son, if you truly believe in me, you should be able to prove my innocence. I know you can do it.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>He believes I'll prove him innocent. Even with all these inconvenient truths? Is that what he's saying?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I think Dhurke might be on to something. Even the most disadvantageous facts may point the way to the truth. So don't ignore them. Think of them as food for thought.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Don't worry, I know. <thought>The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles. I need to remember that, no matter how difficult the facts may be to deal with.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">His testimony didn't exactly explain anything, did it?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Nope. In fact, he basically just testified to the effect of he CAN'T explain himself. But that's undoubtedly what Ga'ran wanted.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Just great...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo. We need to turn Dhurke's non-explanation into an explanation about something. Fast.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If only we could establish the possibility of a third party...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But does the possibility itself even exist?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">We don't have a choice. Proving it exists is the only way to start a real dialogue here.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Eminence, I'm afraid this trial will not go exactly as you anticipated. Because I can show how there might have been a third party in that tomb!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Oh, how very fascinating. Go on; I do so love a good fairy tale.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">We did a luminol test at the crime scene. And we found a bloodstain that didn't match the justice minister's blood. I will remind you that neither Dhurke nor Ms. Fey were injured during the incident. The thing is, this bloodstain we found had been wiped up by someone.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What's this?! B-But... Who would've done such a thing?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's the big question, isn't it? Who wiped up the blood, and why? Thinking about it logically... It must be someone who wanted to conceal their presence at the scene of the crime. </line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Oh? And to whom do you suppose the bloodstain might belong?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The bloodstain belongs to...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The bloodstain belongs to Amara Sigatar Khura'in, the previous queen of Khura'in!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Why would Queen Amara's blood be in such a place?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Maybe it got there when she was assassinated.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Her tomb was erected on top of the very spot where her residence was put to torch. How could her blood have ended up inside it?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Stranger things have happened.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, like you going this long without a penalty.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Argh! <thought>I guess I was really reaching there.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo, think about who would want to conceal a trail of their own blood. You should be able to make an educated guess from there.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Right! I got this!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The bloodstain belongs to the victim. Minister Inga was stabbed, after all!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">And? Do you also know who wiped it up?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um... maybe the royal guard after they stormed in?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">You contend they neglected their duty to preserve the crime scene?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Maybe one of them was the royal janitor, and just couldn't help himself.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Such an imbecile would never rise to the rank of royal guard. Your Magistry!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Clean up your act, defense!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Angh! <thought>Where's a royal janitor when you need one?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo, just think about who would want to cover up their bloodstain.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">R-Right. Got it.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The bloodstain belongs to the real killer, of course. Whoever it was, they were probably shot while they were attacking Minister Inga. And since their blood would give them away, they had to wipe it up. And I say this because we know for a fact that the justice minister fired his gun in the tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Very well, then, tell me this: Where was this third party hiding?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, um...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The crime scene was thoroughly searched after it was discovered. So if there was a hiding place, it would have to be somewhere no one would dare look.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Somewhere no one would dare look? Hmm...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let's have your answer, defense. Now, where could a third party have hidden?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">How could anyone have hidden there?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well... think of it this way. The killer could have hidden anywhere.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I am afraid I don't follow.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What if the killer was a dwarf? That means the smallest of spaces could become a hiding place.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">By dwarf... you mean those little people who appear in fairy tales?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Exactly. That solves all the mysteries surrounding this case! After the royal guard stormed in, the dwarf escaped through the partially opened door... ...or clung on to one of the guards when they were leaving.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What nonsense! Did the dwarf also make off with your brain, defense?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">B-But you can't unequivocally assert that there wasn't a dwarf there, can you?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Just as you cannot assert there was one there, either.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Oh, right. Well, let's just forget I said that then.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The Hall of Justice is no place for flights of fancy!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I-I'll stay more grounded next time! Promise!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">There's one place no one would search, not even the queen's royal guard. And that would be... Inside Queen Aamara's sarcophagus. Even now, it's locked up tight. No one would find you if you hid in there. I'm told that it's temperature-controlled to preserve the mummy within. But if someone dressed warmly enough, they could withstand the cold for a short time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Th-This is sacrilege! Surely the perpetrator of such a foul deed would be cursed!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But that's just it. The killer knew everyone would be too scared to open the sarcophagus.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">True. The guards were so scared of being cursed, they wouldn't even touch it.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">And when the coast was clear... ...the killer made a quick escape from within their frigid confines. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, now! That does sound like a plausible method of evading capture.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The defense requests a DNA test on the bloodstain! And then we'll see just who the real killer is!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Such insolence!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Bow our head and knell, lawyer... ...so your head may be parted from your shoulders.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh? But the trial's not even over. Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">How soon you forget. You are already on the headsman's scaffold. As such, I could order your beheading at any moment.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Um, all I did was request a DNA test.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">There is no need to request such a test. Royal guard. Bring it forth now.</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">Here you are, Your Eminence!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">The police have already identified the source of the bloodstain. The DNA test revealed... ...that the blood is of the traitor, Dhurke Sahdmadhi.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What?! But Dhurke wasn't injured. So where did his blood come from?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maybe he coughed it up.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">! <thought>Dhurke's illness... Still there was a lot of blood. Could he have really coughed up that much? And did he wipe it up to hide his failing health? Dhurke... Is it really that bad...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Aw, shoot. You got me.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Pay attention, Horned Devil. For this case has already been solved. You claimed that this bloodstain would lead us to the real killer, did you not?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um, about that...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Did you or did you not make that claim of your own volition, defense?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes... I did.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...After she steered you in that direction, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Arnngh...! <thought>I fell right into her trap.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Heh heh heh. Do you see now, the folly in opposing the very embodiment of the law? Whatever you say or do shall come to no avail. A third party at the scene of the crime? It's beyond the realm of possibility!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">Praise be for Queen Ga'ran! Her Eminence's legal tactics are beyond compare!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I hate to say this, but she really got us good.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">The key to Amara's sarcophagus is under the protection of the royal family. My husband and I are the only ones who could open it. Therefore, it would be impossible for some knave to open it.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Can I really discount the sarcophagus as a hiding place, though? What if the real killer is still in there? ...No, that's just ridiculous.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">I believe we have rebels and sympathizers in the gallery today. It is to you I speak. Have you been listening? Dhurke Sahdmadhi, the one who proclaimed a bloodless revolt... ...has betrayed your cause by resorting to murder.</line>
<line speaker="Gallery">No, it can't be. Dhurke would never...There must be some kind of mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">........................</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>The Defiant Dragons and their sympathizers are starting to have doubts.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So this is why Ga'ran allowed us to cross-examine Dhurke. By establishing his guilt in Inga's murder... ...she's effectively damaged his reputation among those who support him.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">True, but now we have an even bigger problem.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">And now, filthy lawyers, you will honor your end of the bargain. Accept your guilty verdict for your failure to explain your client's actions.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........*gulp*</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Now, I shall pass judgment on the criminal, Dhurke Sahdmadhi.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What's this? You...? Shall pass judgment...? ...But Your Eminence, is that not my role...?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hold your tongue. You are but a figurehead before me, the embodiment of law. ...Consider yourself dismissed.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">..................</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">As queen of Khura'in, I shall now pass judgment upon the accused!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............</line>
<line speaker="Judge">..................</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">........................</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Know when you are defeated, lawyer. .........But just this once, I am willing to show you the depths of my compassion. Tell me why I should allow these proceedings to continue. Come, convince me.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Q-Quick, Apollo! Even if you have to bluff, we've got to keep this trial going. Show her that the crime could've been committed by a third party!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">How am I supposed to do that?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">O-Oh, um... Why don't you start with... um... How about the timing of Inga's murder?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This whole case is built on a single premise... ...that Inga was murdered after Dhurke entered the tomb. But what if that's not true?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Like, if our assumptions are all wrong? <thought>Hmm... It just might work...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, don't keep us waiting, defense.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Umm... Dhurke became the prime suspect... ...because it didn't seem probable that there was a third party at the scene of the crime. But there is another question we should ask ourselves at this time. Was Minister Inga really killed after Dhurke entered the tomb?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">......... What nonsense is this?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Setting aside the assumption that the murder occurred after Dhurke arrived on the scene... ...opens up the possibility of a third party committing the crime. The question before us is, when was Minister Inga really killed?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Maybe he was murdered after his body was found.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......I'm afraid I don't understand. How could there have been a body to discover BEFORE the murder occurred?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's like one of those Zen riddles. I saw a show about them on TV the other day. They're questions or stories that can't be explained using logic. But continual meditation on the illogical can lead to enlightenment. A famous example is, "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...I have a better question, defense. What is the sound of one penalty landing?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oww!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Better save those riddles for later, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">L-Let me try that again, Your Magistry!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">A third party committed the murder after Dhurke entered the tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh? Could you kindly tell us who it was and how they did it?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...I was going to do that right now, with everyone's help, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What a wonderful idea... ...were this a classroom.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Lesson learned.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo, if Dhurke isn't the culprit... ...then it should really narrow down when the murder could've happened.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">R-Right... Could I have another shot at that, please, Your Magistry?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Isn't it possible that... ...before Dhurke even set foot in the tomb, Minister Inga was already dead?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... That would certainly make the possibility of a third party more probable.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">...Why, of course. I fell unconscious right after I entered the tomb. Even if I hadn't, I wouldn't have had a clear line of sight to his body from the entrance. Which means...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...You wouldn't have noticed his body either way. This scenario is entirely possible. And so we can't rule out the possibility of a third person committing the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......I see... Well, that certainly does make sense.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>So far, so good... This might actually work!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Very well. I shall play along with whatever little game you have knocking around in that tiny mind. I was starting to get quite bored of all this; I could do with a distraction.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Yes!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Let us hear some testimony that will shed light on when exactly the minister was slain. Bailiff, summon Rayfa. Surely she has recovered by now.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........B-But what about me...? Don't I serve a purpose anymore...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I hope you are feeling better, Your Benevolence.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........Must I perform the Divination Séance?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What? ...Oh, no, no. We merely require your testimony this time.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">............... ...How could my testimony be of any value?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your Benevolence?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Princess Rayfa seems awfully depressed.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">After what she's been through, summoning her again is like rubbing salt in the wound. Being unable to perform the Séance was probably the last straw.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>I hope she doesn't pass out again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, may I ask you something?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Of course, Your Benevolence.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I, um... I've been meaning to ask you this since yesterday. Did you know about... ...Queen Amara... ...and... about me?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">! From where did you hear such a thing...?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">From Mother... and only yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Rayfa was carrying on about telling the truth to the people. So I told her. I told her what the "truth" really was. For it is up to a mother to discipline her child.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...I see. Be as it may, Your Benevolence, it has no bearing upon our trial here today. So, there is no need to let it trouble you.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...I know.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Ga'ran told Rayfa about something other than Amara's status?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Sounds like it, but what could it be?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Rayfa, the defense has proposed something preposterous. They somehow think your father was already dead when Dhurke entered the tomb. But I believe you can prove them wrong. Are you prepared to do what is required of you?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">..................Yes. I am ready to testify.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, then, Your Benevolence. Your testimony, if you please...</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">On the day of the murder, I was gazing upon the courtyard from my second-floor veranda.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your second-floor veranda? <thought>Oh, she must be talking about that house facing Inga's private residence.</thought> So that's the location from which you saw your father? And at about 2:30?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Yes. And shortly after that, you people arrived at the royal residence.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So, after the minister entered Amara's Tomb at around 2:30... ...no one went in or out of there until the murder was discovered?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">The tomb is closed to outsiders, so no one could have snuck in before the murder. That rules out any possibility of a third party lying in wait to slay my poor husband.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Or so she'd like us to believe.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Now hear me, you useless lawyer. Cease this charade and bow before me. For I, Queen Ga'ran, shall finally have your head!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nngh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Forgive me, Your Eminence, but first, let us allow the defense to question the witness.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">On the day of the murder, I was gazing upon the courtyard from my second-floor veranda.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">............There is much that weighs on my mind.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I see... <thought>She really does sound troubled.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I don't think she ever fully recovered from the previous trial.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.................. I wonder if I am even up to the task.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...I guess it's not easy being a princess. ...Um, Your Benevolence? I'd be happy to lend an ear if you'd ever like to talk.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........Hmph. What would you know of my woes? Do not presume to exceed your station in life!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Sheesh... Teenagers.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your Benevolence, what did you witness from your veranda?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Well...</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Around 2:30 PM, I saw my father heading for Amara's Tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Hmm, let me think... ...Oh, there was one unusual thing.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">There was?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Yes, a shriek emanated from within my father's quarters... ...after which I witnessed him bolt outside, his countenance drained of its usual color.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">He screamed and he was looking pale? What do you suppose happened?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I know not. Perhaps he had a bad dream.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Maybe it was a nightmare about being raked over the coals by the queen.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...It seems our young lawyer here wishes to hasten his journey to the Twilight Realm.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">S-Sorry, sorry! That was rude of me.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Does the defense believe the witness's last statement to be important?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I believe it is. I would like the witness to add it to her testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Rayfa:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I-I... I didn't see anyone else... Just my father.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>That last statement was seriously lacking in conviction. Should I press her on this?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Poor thing, I feel sorry for her. I'll just leave it be for now.</thought> Your Benevolence, please continue with your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Benevolence. </line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Y-Yes? This incident was a real shock to us all. It must have been really terrible for you. But I want to let you know, I know how you feel.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">P-Please, stop. You... presume too much.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's times like these that you need something to take your mind off things! How about we all go on a picnic together or something?!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........I need no sympathy from you! Go on your little picnic alone, Horn Head!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Well, that didn't go well.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo. You have to take a more aggressive approach with people like her.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Yeah, he's probably right.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...Now, back to my testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Benevolence! Let's have some details! The more, the better!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">D-Details, you say? </line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes. For example, are you sure you didn't see anyone in the royal residence before 2:30?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well?! Is that a yes or a no?!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Eek! F-Foreign devil! I'd been gazing upon the courtyard since about 2 yesterday... ...yet I saw none other than my father. .........Oh, if only I had stopped him then. *sniffle*</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I think you've struck a nerve, or rather, obliterated one.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Maybe I pressed a little too hard... <thought>Still... that last statement seemed a little off somehow.</thought> So, you didn't see anyone except your father in the courtyard after 2PM, huh. Please add that to your testimony, Your Benevolence. </line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Rafya:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Naturally. It is where the royal family lives, and we are few in number. Besides Nayna and the little birds who visit, I have no one else to talk to.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Is there anything more stereotypically princess-y than talking to birds?</thought> So Nayna wasn't around at all yesterday?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">It seems she was quite busy. I was all alone the entire day. It's been like that a lot lately.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Rayfa doesn't go to school, so she probably doesn't have any close friends. She must lead a rather solitary life.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I guess being a princess isn't all it's cracked up to be.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Rayfa, I shall buy you a new servant.</line>
<line speaker="Rafya">I-I don't want you to buy me a servant like some sort of pet! I want Nayna!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>I'm beginning to see why Rayfa turned out like she did.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your Benevolence, please tell us about what happened after you saw your father.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Well, it was around 2:30 when I saw him heading for the tomb...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Then, at about 2:45, I saw Barbed Head and company enter the courtyard.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Yes. I was taken aback, as we don't normally see commoners in the palace courtyard. Even more shocking was that Dhurke -- a wanted man -- was with you.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yeah, I suppose so.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I thought the villainous leader of the Defiant Dragons was here with his minions... ...because it was, you know, "time for a revolution."</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I think you've been watching too much of that TV show.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">I have already banned its broadcast for containing content unsuitable for our kingdom. Besides, the actress playing Rayfa looked nothing like her. I can't have my subjects feeling so... disappointed when they see the real Rayfa.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">M-Mother...! Why are you so cruel to me?! Are you so ashamed?! Once I am all grown up, I shall be just as full-figured as that actress!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She's placing all her hopes on one final growth spurt.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">For her sake, I hope it's in her DNA...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">I suppose you could always hope for a miracle...</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Oooh... I'll show you! I shall double my milk intake and grow up big and strong!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">There there, Your Benevolence. I think you are fine, just the way you are. Now, may I ask that you continue with your testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...I wish I could grow up faster.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I saw no one go in or out of the tomb after my father entered at about 2:30.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">No. My veranda has a commanding view of the entire grounds, and I saw no one else.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Hmm... But that doesn't seem right, somehow.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hmph. Do not underestimate my daughter. She may be lacking elsewhere, but her eyes are the finest.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">L-Lacking elsewhere?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Talk about a mother I'd never wish on my worst enemy...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She needs Nayna now more than ever.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So no one entered the tomb after Inga went in at about 2:30? And no one was seen leaving it, either?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But if the murder occurred before 3 PM... ...then Rayfa should have seen the killer going in or out.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well... ...we'll just have to try to get as much info out of her as we can.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Rayfa didn't see anybody in the royal residence area after 2PM? </line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's a really long time to just look at a courtyard...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She was probably lost in thought. She's at the age where I'm sure she's got a lot on her mind.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Benevolence. You're covering for someone, aren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Huh?! I-I-I... I don't know what you're talking about.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Sorry Rayfa, but you're not gonna like this...</thought> ...Well, the thing is, I have a statement here that you might find interesting. It's from a witness who claims that... ...around 2 PM, his dog got loose and ran into the palace courtyard. That's when the little fellow stole this hat from someone.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Ah! That's...! That's Nayna's! ...I mean! Nothing! Never mind!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...............</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........You fool of a daughter.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It seems the princess made a blunder.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um... So let me get this straight. This is Nayna's hat, which means she had to have been in the royal residence at around 2. If so, then you had to have seen Nayna sometime after 2 PM yesterday!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Ooh. Noooooooooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Please, Your Benevolence, tell us what you REALLY saw!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">............Urngh. It is as you say, Horn Head. I... I saw Nayna. And I saw that... that dingbat dog steal her hat from her in front of my father's residence.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>I knew it!</thought> ...Why didn't you say so in the first place?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">B-Because, um... my mother told me not to.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What?! ...Would you care to explain, Your Eminence?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">I requested she withhold said information, for it is of no relevance to this case.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Such insolence!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">If you disagree, then prove that it is relevant to the case at hand.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Oh, I will. Your Benevolence, please tell us everything you witnessed when you saw Nayna.</line>
<line speaker="Rafya">A-All right. When I saw that dingbat dog attack Nayna, I ran to help. I raced from my second-floor veranda down into the courtyard.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wait. That means that while you were coming down, you took your eyes off the courtyard.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Yes, but only for a moment.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">This... This is crucial testimony! If you took your eyes off the courtyard... ...it means somebody else could've entered the tomb without you ever knowing!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Benevolence... Are you sure no one else was there?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">O-Oh, uhh... Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>She's hiding something again.</thought> ...What about Nayna? Were you able to help her?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Wh-When I got down to the courtyard, Nayna was... She was gone.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">G-Gone?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Yes, and I never saw her again after that.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Any idea what happened?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...Th-That dingbat dog must have gobbled her up!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........I seriously doubt that. <thought>But how could Nayna simply disappear while Rayfa wasn't looking? ...Rayfa must know something. The only question is, what?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Do you have any idea why that dog was in the courtyard?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">No.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>She brushed that off real quick.</thought> Um, could you please think a little harder?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Those puppy dog eyes will not help me recall something I know nothing about, Horn Head.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">P-Puppy dog eyes...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo, we already know the answer to your question, remember?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, right. <thought>And it really has nothing to do with the case...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Why do you suppose Nayna disappeared? Even an educated guess would help. </line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">For example...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">For example, maybe she got fed up with you acting like a spoiled child? You know, something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">That's enough!</line>
<line speaker="Rafya">Such impudence! Nayna would not leave me merely for acting spoiled!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You're not even going to deny your behavior? <thought>In any case, it seems I was wrong. Moving right along...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Do you have any idea... where Nayna disappeared to?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Wh-What do you mean?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, during the time you took your eyes off the courtyard... ...someone could have headed into the tomb. And it just so happens that Nayna disappeared right at that moment.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">No!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wait, you think Nayna had something to do with the murder?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I don't think we can rule it out. It sounds like something had kept Nayna occupied since the early morning. Plus, she was seen right before the murder, and then seemed to vanish into thin air.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You're right! And since she's Rayfa's attendant... ...she could come and go as she pleased within the palace grounds.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Could Rayfa's attendant really be the killer? But that would mean...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">First my father, and now Nayna...? These were the people I trusted most... How could this be...?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">How can you be so sure?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">When Nayna's hat was stolen... ...that crazed cur spilled an urn full of water upon my husband's doorstep. Is that not right, Rayfa?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Yes. Yes, it is. While that dingbat dog was tugging on Nayna's hat, it tipped over the urn. </line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">The bottoms of her shoes would have been soaked with water. And if she had truly headed into the tomb with wet shoes... ...she would have left shoeprints along the way. But the only shoeprints to be found belonged to my husband, Inga.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh? Th-Then...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">That's right. Nayna never did go into the tomb that day. Instead, she entered my husband's private quarters.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">How do you know?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">It's quite simple. Shoeprints were discovered in Inga's private quarters. Shoeprints that belonged to Nayna.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's right! Edgeworth and I did see some shoeprints in there.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Now do you understand? Nayna could not have possibly have gone into the tomb. And that supposed third person at the crime scene is but a figment of your imagination.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Argh.</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">Another gloooorious deduction! All hail the genius that is Her Eminence, Queen Ga'raaan! Bow down before her glory, witless laaawyer! Ur dihara Ga'ran!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Could those guys fanboy any harder? But is it really true? Did Nayna not go into the tomb?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Excuse me, but...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Benevolence, what time was it when that dog attacked Nayna?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I believe it was about 2:15 PM.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I see... Apollo. If Nayna entered Inga's private quarters at around 2:15... ...and Inga came racing out at around 2:30... ...pale-faced and screaming, then...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ah! I know what you're getting at! .........Yes, that might explain his scream.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Would the defense please share their theory regarding Justice Minister Inga's scream?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">C-Certainly, Your Magistry. Minister Inga screamed because...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">He must've had a bad dream.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">What sort of dream could cause my father to let out such a howl?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um... Maybe he'd dreamt of you becoming a juvenile delinquent.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">What?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Dying your hair purple, chasing him around on a motorcycle... Stuff like that.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...Excuse me?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That would freak out any parent, that's for sure. But would it change anything we know about this case?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Guess not... <thought>Let's try that again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Maybe he saw a ghost. Maybe even a bunch of ghosts, like from all the people he's sentenced to death.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">G-G-Ghosts? Really?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Sure. And they'll be back tonight. The spirits of the dead, unable to rest in peace.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Eeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">If you're not careful, Your Benevolence, they might curse you too.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">That's enough!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">S-S-Stop, please! I'll never be able to sleep again!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You seem awfully frightened for a princess who communes with spirits.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo, don't you think you've teased her enough? Come on. Let's think this one over again.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You're right.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Maybe he was attacked by Nayna. This would make the justice minister's private quarters the real scene of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Do I think the minister was moved from his private quarters? I think the possibility...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Considering the fact that the body was found in the tomb, I'd say there is a possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hmph. What utter nonsense. Rayfa had been watching the courtyard. Yet you would suggest that someone could have transported the body unnoticed?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You... have a point there. In that case...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I'd say... there's no way that the body was moved. After all, there was an awful lot of blood in the tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I understand if the scream was in reaction to Nayna's attack... But Inga died in the tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...We need to explain how those two realities could coincide. <thought>How are we supposed to do that?</thought> ............... Oh, maybe... Maybe where he was stabbed and where he died were two completely different locations.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's just, let's look at this as simply as possible. If the minister's body wasn't moved... ...he might've been stabbed by Nayna in his private quarters... ...but then died in the tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm? ...............Hrrmm, I see. On the one hand, that seems plausible, but on the other, it seems decidedly implausible. </line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, what is that fool babbling on about now? Is this a riddle from one of those "fortune cookies" Americans seems so fond of?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Perhaps. But I believe he himself does not know what he means to say. In all likelihood, it was a poor attempt to confuse us. We should simply ignore him.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh, my! Are you...?! Are you suggesting he ran all the way to the tomb with a knife sticking out of his back?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Well, yes, that's the gist of it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">In short, Minister Inga saw Nayna with a knife... ...let out a scream, and when he turned his back to her to flee...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Right. And that's when he was stabbed from behind. Well, Your Magistry? Does my theory hold water?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Such insolence!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...How dare you bore me like this?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">You are a humorless moron, spewing an endless stream of unamusing drivel.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I wasn't trying to be funny, Your Eminence.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Prosecutor, enlighten this ignorant clown in lawyer's clothing.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Your Eminence. Hah!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............N-Nahyuta? </line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">You dull, slow-witted, putrid minded lawyer. Perhaps YOU would be too stupid to notice you had been stabbed in the back... ...but a normal person would have noticed due to the excruciating pain.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">N-Now hold on...</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Allow me to teach you the meaning of pain! Hrnh!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Aaaaaaaaaaaah! P-Please stoooooooooooop!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Nahyuta has a point. Normally, most people would notice a dagger in their back.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Owwww... Yeah, I doubt someone could ignore pain like this.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Still, in this case, it's the word "normally" that we should emphasize. Apollo, take another look at the Court Record.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">R-Right... <thought>There must be something that explains this.</thought> There's a reason Inga didn't feel any pain. And the defense will submit evidence proving just that!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, please present your evidence. Why didn't Justice Minister Inga notice that he had been stabbed?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Umm... Maybe the sight of it... paralyzed him with shock?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The only things that are paralyzed here are the synapses in the defense's brain. Perhaps this penalty will get them firing again!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Gack! <thought>Talk about a brain fart.</thought> Your Magsitry, please give me another chance!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. But next time, your penalty shall be far more severe. Now, let us have your answer.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Ahh! Th-Those are my father's painkiller shots!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The defense will explain the significance of this evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Minister Inga suffered from terrible back pain, so he often injected himself with these. We're told that one shot in the back would make all his pain go away. With this, it's easy to explain what happened! Don't tell me you didn't know about these, Your Eminence?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">! You can't mean...?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Minister Inga was stabbed in his back, close to where he usually injected the painkiller. Therefore... It's entirely possible that he hadn't noticed that he'd been stabbed!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Wha--?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What's this...?! Then, then...! Are you suggesting Justice Minister Inga really ran off with a knife protruding from his back?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I am, Your Magistry.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">So then, when I saw my father, he had a knife sticking out of him? I mean, with that cape of his, I couldn't see his back very well...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes, the knife was there. I was just plunged in so deep, you didn't notice it under the cape. Therefore, when you saw your father... he was already "dead"... ...murdered by Nayna in his private quarters!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">P-P-Pohlkunkaaaaaaaa!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">H-Holy Mother of Khura'in! Are we dealing with the living dead here?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, technically, he wasn't dead yet.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I know it's hard to believe, but this is a plausible sequence of events. And once Minister Inga arrived at the tomb... ...he could have removed the knife, and dropped dead from blood loss!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Nayna killed my father...? There must be some mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The defense would like to call Nayna to the stand!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">W-Well... there's no real proof, but...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hmph. What a tangled web of expedient lies you weave.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........I can no longer tell fact from fiction. Who or what shall I believe in now?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>I'm sorry, Rayfa. All I've done is confuse you. But... I have a sneaking suspicion Nayna's involved in this case one way or another.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Just when I thought we'd blown this case wide open...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, there's no turning back now.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........You fool of a lawyer. I know why you are so desperate to prove the accused innocent.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You do?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Yes, because he faces public execution if proven guilty... ...as shall you, under the stipulations of the Defense Culpability Act. From the moment you accepted this case, you have had no choice but to fight for your lives.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...No. The simple fact is I've always believed that Dhurke is innocent.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Bah! Still you cling to your pretense? ...Very well, I shall offer you a bargain. If you would admit that the accused is guilty, right here, right now... ...I shall overlook your crime of abetting him, and you will not be subject to execution.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Is this some sort of joke?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Far from it. As queen, I have the power to grant pardons, even to criminals like you. And with the wave of my hand, I can even reduce the severity of a sentence. ...Perhaps even for Dhurke, should you be willing to cooperate.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She wasn't kidding when she said that she's the law here. But to flaunt that power in our faces like that? That's just wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Forget all that has transpired in our kingdom, and return to your own country in peace. Well? Will you abandon your defense of the accused and accept my generous offer?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>If I don't take this deal, we'll be executed along with Dhurke if he's found guilty. What should I do?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>We'll be executed if we lose this trial. Poor Trucy will lose her father... I'd feel bad for Athena, too. And besides, life is precious. It's not something you should gamble with. Still... I made a promise. And there's one more person I can't abandon in his time of need. Which leaves me with only one choice.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Nice try, Ga'ran, but it looks like you don't know what Justice is made of.</thought> We won't kowtow to threats like that, Your Eminence!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Mr. Wright. I'm sorry, but I can't back down now. I don't want to drag you into this, so...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Don't worry, I'm with you, Apollo... to the bitter end, if need be. And while I can't say I'm used to it, this isn't exactly my first rodeo.</line>
<line speaker="Ahlbi">But if I'm found guilty, you'll get the death penalty, too... Even knowing that, you still want to defend me?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I don't know what happened in the past... ...but it looks like everyone in this country considers lawyers to be liars. So I can understand if you don't believe me. But... I still believe in you, and your innocence.</line>
<line speaker="Ahlbi">!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So all I have to do is keep believing, and find the truth. That's all there is to it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So keep on fighting, Apollo. You'll hear no objections from me!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Y-You... You nincompoops! You'll die if you lose this case! Why would you even entertain the notion of continuing?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I believe that Dhurke is innocent. That's why. And besides, trials exist to give the truth a chance to get out into the open. You can't give up just because you're afraid of some punishment.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Even if that punishment is death? Does that not frighten you, Horn Head?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Who wouldn't be scared? I mean, just thinking about it... ...makes me weak in the knees, to be honest. But as a lawyer, I have a duty to protect my client. I can't just abandon that.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........A duty you're willing to die for? .........And yet, I... I...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Duty... It's a heavy burden, all right. Rayfa looks like she's really struggling.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.................. I wonder if I am even up to the task.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But it's no surprise, considering the torrent of painful truths she's had to face.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.....................</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........Very well, then. If the defense is prepared to face the death sentence under the Defense Culpability Act... ...then I see no reason not to continue with the proceedings. But I must admit, I see no grounds for doubting the accused's guilt.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Unless, the defense has further evidence that would indicate a different suspect?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......... <thought>Do we have anything like that...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Well, lawyer? Do you have any new evidence you would care to present? Or shall I have the executioner start his preparations?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>If she thinks I can't do this, she's got another thing coming! But first, I have some serious thinking to do.</thought> I'd say that new evidence indicating a different suspect...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Of course I have some new evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ho ho ho. Do you, now? How very interesting...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Why doesn't she sound the least bit concerned? No, I can't let her get to me. I just have to keep pressing forward.</thought> This new evidence points to a different suspect!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........You would claim this evidence proves the existence of a different suspect?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Wait. That wasn't the reaction I was expecting.</thought> Um, Your Eminence, are you saying this piece of evidence doesn't do anything for you?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...It would appear to me that you chose that evidence at random... in the vain hope you would learn something from my reaction. Is that not correct?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ulp!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Your Magistry?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">For shame!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">S-Sorry...! <thought>Time to rethink that one.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Such evidence... does not exist.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hmph, just as I thought. I was so hoping you'd present meaningless evidence and allow me to claim your head.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Glad I didn't walk head-first into that one, then...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So, what now, Apollo?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, unless we can prove that Nayna killed Inga... ...this trial is over -- and so are we.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Isn't there still a way to get the proof we need... ...even without evidence? You know, a key means of obtaining testimony here in Khura'in?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Huh? ...Wait, are you actually suggesting...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It certainly won't be easy, but it's worth a try.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Your Magistry. A crucial step in uncovering the truth behind this case has yet to be taken in this trial. But I'm positive that I can back up our claim with this one step.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You mean you will be able to prove that Nayna killed Justice Minister Inga? And just how do you propose to do that?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">With the help of a certain someone.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You need help...?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">From someone...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, I can't imagine who it could be. But I suppose I must ask. Whose help do you need to uncover the truth?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...No, what I'm saying is... ...let's all come together on this one. If we all think it through as a team, there's nothing we can't figure out!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...We don't need to put our heads together to see how far you're reaching, defense!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">C-Can't we all just get along? <thought>There's something we've yet to confirm about this case. And to do that, we'll need--!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">The defense will refrain from such tongue-wagging if he wishes to keep said tongue. Now then...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-But that is...!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........M-Me?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Here in Khura'in, legal proceedings include the viewing of the victim's final moments. But that requires Your Benevolence's help.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Such information is just as vital as any other piece of conclusive evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If you're right about this... ...Rayfa's power should enable her to see the very moment Nayna stabbed Inga.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It will be hard to watch your father's murder... ...but it's the only way to uncover the truth. ...Your Benevolence, we need you and your power!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........You need me...?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........Am I... prepared? ...Prepared to fulfill my duty?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Isn't a Divination Séance required at all trials, anyway? If so, I imagine there'd be a problem with handing down a verdict without one.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Indeed. It would be problematic. Under Khura'inese law, a Séance must be conducted before a verdict can be rendered.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Such insolence!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yikes!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Hmph. Must you try my patience so? If I must dispense with that vexing law, then dispense with it I shall.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">As ruling sovereign of Khura'in, I proclaim the following: Henceforth, the Divination Séance shall be... optional.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?! <thought>She has the power to do that?!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sh-She just rewrote the law with a flourish of her hand.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Rayfa:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Such insolence!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Rayfa, do not be fooled by his lawyerly guile. You are not prepared to witness your father's death.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...........................But... Horn Head needs my help.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Rayfa, did you not tell me earlier? Did you not tell me you were prepared? But despite your grandiose posturing, you collapsed in a most piteous fashion.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Ngh.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Even worse, you have erred in your Insights of late. For has not the Barbed One there overturned them more than once?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Ooh...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">You cannot be trusted to keep your word, nor can you reveal the truth through your Insights. So, I say to you -- begone! This sacred Hall of Justice has no need for such a worthless royal priestess.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">W-W-W... Worthless?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Wow... How can she say that to her own daughter?!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........So, Mother, you think me worthless? ...........................</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">........................ .........Very well, Horned Devil. If you really are so bent on having a Séance, I shall give my consent.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">! <thought>Really?!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">However, should Rayfa fail once more... ...you two and the accused shall all be executed on the spot.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Come again?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Heh heh heh. This is proving to be far more entertaining than I had anticipated. ...Well, lawyer? What say you? Will you wager your life and call on Rayfa to perform a Divination Séance?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Even if I say I believe in and want to call on her... ...the truth is, I really don't know her that well.</thought> Your Benevolence, maybe you should go on home today? I'm sure you could use the rest.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Are you sure about this, Apollo? If we don't believe in her, who does she have left?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Y-You're right. </line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Besides, without her, we'll never get the proof we need.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Y-Yeah.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">............So, it would seem I truly am not needed here.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I don't think you're worthless, Your Benevolence. Far from it, in fact. If you say you can do it, then I believe in you!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">H-Horn Head?! I do not understand... If I fail, you will be put to death.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........I know you collapsed during your previous attempt... I can't even imagine how terrible it must've been for you. But despite that... ...you are willing to try again. I have faith in that conviction -- in that courage.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">My... My courage?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ahh... So she was doomed to fail if she didn't have the courage to perform the Séance. But it looks like she's got the determination to try again.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Right. And that's a bet I'm willing to take.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.................. But... It is as Mother said. I've erred in my Insights as of late. Not only have I failed to reveal the truth, I've also contributed to false accusations. Knowing that, can you still say that you believe in me?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">In the trials I've been a part of here in Khura'in... ...I would have never proven my clients' innocence without your Séances. Because even though they didn't always reflect the absolute truth... ...the insight they provided served as vital leads to finding the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...Vital leads? My Séances?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So, please, Your Benevolence. Try to perform the Divination Séance one more time!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........I... I...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">........................ N-No.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">What did you say?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I said, no, Mother! For I am the Royal Priestess of Khura'in!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">I have no need for you now!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Even if you do not need me, Mother... ...Horn Head and this Hall of Justice do! He proved that to me by risking his own life! It is because of him that I now understand! The Divination Séance is my sacred duty! I must fulfill it, no matter the risk!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Benevolence...</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Mother taught me that the Divination Séance was a mirror reflecting naught but the truth. But I began to have my doubts after Barbed Head disproved the Insights it offered. And now, I don't even know who or what to trust anymore. Father, Mother, even Nayna... I had believed in them above all others. But... I finally know now. I know in what I can trust. The royal priestess must debate each Séance with the presiding lawyer and prosecutor... ...so that it can be interpreted properly. That is how I believe trials here in Khura'in should function. Therefore, the Hall of Justice needs me. It is my power that leads trials toward the truth. That is my sacred duty, and I will never shirk from it again.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That right there, Your Benevolence... ...is the product of what you've learned in your struggles so far... ...the truth that you realized with your own strength.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">As my sacred duty, I musst ensure that it is fulfilled. I must have the courage and resolve to see it through!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Eminence, the royal priestess says she will conduct the Divination Séance. I see no grounds for you to forbid it... ...unless, of course, you are worried that it might reveal something you find inconvenient.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........Mother! I am done letting you have your way!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Rayfa, you would actually rebel against me? Your mother and queen?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Though I am scared to see my father's death... ...I must face my fear! That... is what Horn Head has taught me here today.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Rayfa...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I am the Royal Priestess, Rayfa Padma Khura'in! I am prepared to face my father's death!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Eminence. It seems the princess is more grown up than you thought.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Rayfa.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, then. Let us proceed with the Divination Séance.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>The victim's final moments... This should be interesting. I wonder what Inga's memories are going to show us...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination Séance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Ugh! Wh-What in the--!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A-A faceless being?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Wh-What the heck? His face, it's just like... ...that picture of the founder!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...I think that's the last thing anyone expected to see.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Oooh... Father... What was it? What was it you saw?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A-Are we to understand that this was the last thing the victim saw?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Y-Yes, there can be no mistake. That was what my father himself witnessed.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... How very strange... You don't suppose... ...the Holy Mother possessed the accused and slew Minister Inga for planning a coup?!</line>
<line speaker="Gallery">The divine wrath of the Holy Mother?O Holy Mother! We are ever grateful for your blessings!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Talk about a sharp left turn into the twilight zone...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...You know, there's one thing in there that caught my attention. That laugh... Who does it belong to, and why are they laughing?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Who knows. Though I suppose it could be Dhurke after he slew my husband.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Uh-huh... <thought>But that figure didn't even have a mouth.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Ho ho ho. I think we're done here, lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">How so?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">You claimed that Minister Inga was stabbed in his private quarters... ...and, feeling no pain, went to the tomb, where he eventually fell dead. But this Séance vision proves he was stabbed in the tomb, and felt great pain, no less.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh. That.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Therefore, as I asserted all along... ...it was the accused who stabbed the minister in the tomb!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ack! <thought>Everything just backfired... big time...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wow... Ga'ran has the devil's own luck, doesn't she?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........Now then, I shall give voice to the soul of the deceased. Listen well and heed these words.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">At around 3 PM, my father was waiting in the tomb to make the hostage exchange.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um... so, what now, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's up to us to knock holes in Rayfa's interpretations of Inga's memories. In other words, we need to prove that her understanding of them could be mistaken.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Okay, I'll give it try. [sic]</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">At around 3 PM, my father was waiting in the tomb to make the hostage exchange.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Benevolence, there seems to be an inconsistency in your interpretation.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">An inconsistency? Where?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Minister Inga is far too relaxed for what was supposedly about to take place. When he heard the voice you claim is Dhurke's... ...he didn't seem the least bit alarmed. He just kept looking at the picture of the founder.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's strange, right? He was waiting for Dhurke to arrive with the Founder's Orb... ...but when he heard that voice, he didn't even turn to look. Don't you think he would've been worried about being attacked from behind?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Augh! Th-Then whose voice was it?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It was likely someone whose presence wouldn't have alarmed him. Someone like... a friend.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>The voice of a third party who wasn't there in the tomb...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo, don't we have something that could reveal the owner of the mystery voice?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...You know, I think we do. Something that Inga had while he was waiting for Dhurke. With it, we just might be able to figure out whose voice it was. I believe we can identify the male voice Minister Inga heard with this.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Rayfa:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Are you sure that's really going to help?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes! As sure as the sun rises in the east!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...Y-You sure are confident. However, I fail to see a connection of any sort.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Unlike the sun, it seems the defense couldn't find the energy to rise to the occasion.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ngah...! <thought>Guess that was a bit too fly-by-night. But I just know there's something that can help us identify the male voice.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Th-That's... my father's...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I know this must be hard for you, but could you please look at this photo? There's something here that can point us toward the identity of the voice. This is the real source of the man's voice!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........I know it's a strange place for a voice to come from, but let's keep an open mind here.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........Your Benevolence?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Please voice my displeasure.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your wish is my command!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Aagh! <thought>So much for being the voice of reason...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Let's take another look at the photo. Didn't it capture something that could reveal the source of the voice Inga heard?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Something that reveals the source of the voice... Wait, I know!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">A-A cell phone...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Right. I believe that the voice the minister heard... ...was of a call on this cell phone.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see... Well, that certainly makes sense. What is Your Eminence's view on the matter?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........I concede the possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Hmm... Then it seems I must refine my vision. It appears that the voice belonged to one of my father's subordinates.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Why do you suppose he was talking to one of them then?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">My father had members of the secret police positioned throughout the palace. They were supposed to contact him as soon as they saw Dhurke and the rest of you.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Okay, now we're getting somewhere!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Benevolence, I believe you have an Insight to revise.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I know, Barbed Head. Don't presume to tell me how to do my duty.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So the voice was coming from the phone... That's good to know. But there might've been other sounds coming from the phone -- sounds that could be clues. Let's take another look at Rayfa's Insights, and really focus on the various sensations.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Okay! I think I'm getting the hang of this now!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">At around 3 PM, my father was waiting in the tomb to make the hostage exchange.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I hate to break it to you, Your Benevolence, but you misinterpreted something again.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Wh-What do you mean... "again"?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Smooth move, Apollo. I think you just hurt her feelings. She may put on a brave face, but she feels more than she lets on.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um... Let me rephrase that, Your Benevolence. Your interpretation of your father's phone call to his subordinate at the palace... ...is inconsistent with his final memory.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">What do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">A lion's roar could be heard over the phone. Don't you find that strange? You claimed the call was with someone at the palace. But let me ask you: Do you keep lions there?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">No. The only animals at the palace are little birdies and my pet frog.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>...Wait, that giant one in front of the minister's house is her pet?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Besides, there aren't any lions in Khura'in. ...We don't even have any zoos. A rather sad state of affairs, I'm afraid.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, I remember hearing a sound like that. The lion's roar coming from the phone is actually from something hanging out in...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The answer couldn't be more simple: the jungle! That's where lions live, right?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">So, the subordinate my father was talking to was in the jungle?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Maybe he sent him there to get some savage beasts to use in his coup d'état.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Whaaat?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">In other words... Minister Inga was planning to have lions and gorillas attack the palace!</line>
<line speaker="Rafya">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">............ I've never heard anything more absurd.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Argh... <thought>What's so absurd about gorilla warfare?</thought> L-Let me try that again.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The roar came from Tehm'pul Temple.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Don't be stupid! There are no lions in or around the temple!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Actually, I was thinking the exact same thing.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The defense will think before it speaks.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Y-Yes, sir... For my next thought... ...the defense would like another shot at the question, Your Magistry!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Isn't that the cry of the warbaa'd over in the bazaar?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Your Benevolence, do you think you can clarify the voice for me?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...Very well. I will now attempt to further refine my vision. What's this?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Just as I suspected... It was the call of a warbaa'd. That means the subordinate Minister Inga was talking to... ...was in the bazaar, not the palace!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">B-But why is it important where the call came from? What significance could it have?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>She's right... Is it important to know where the call was made from?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>It's not important. ...Wait, what am I thinking? Considering what happened in the bazaar...</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's actually very important! Knowing that the person on the other end was at the bazaar means... ...that the loud explosion might not have been the sound of a gunshot!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">B-B-But...! I can think of no other item that makes such a noise in the area.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Go ahead, Apollo. Tell her. Tell Rayfa the real source of that sound.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Will do.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Well, Horn Head? I'm waiting. What was the true source of that explosive sound?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Rayfa:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes. Maybe...</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">That's not a very clear answer at all. Could it be you lack confidence in your claim?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Maybe? Maybe not? Who's to say?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...Your Magistry. Pound some confidence into this wishy-washy lawyer for me, would you?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Certainly, Your Benevolence.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Confidence received!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo, let's take a good look at the evidence. You should be able to find the source of the explosion there.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I hope you have a more definite answer this time, Horn Head. Now...</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">What is that...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's Ahlbi Ur'gaid's statement. In it, he claims that Datz Are'bal threw a firecracker at him while he was at the bazaar.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Then...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes, the sound heard over the phone was a firecracker exploding.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Ahhhhhhhhh!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, we don't know whether it was fired during the course of the crime, right? Or do you have evidence that proves when the pistol was discharged?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Hmph. No, I have none.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wait a second. If that loud bang was a firecracker... ...then could that laugh at the end have been...? .........No...! It can't be...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, it can. And it is. The laugh came from none other than... ...the joker who got a kick out of startling Ahlbi with his Dragon Snot Snaps. That happy-go-lucky Datz Are'bal!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Whaaaaaaaaat?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Someone should really put a leash on that guy.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I shudder to think how one man can be the cause of so much trouble.</line>
<line speaker="Datz">Haaar har har har har har! Hey there, AJ, PW! Y'all can thank me later!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">No one asked for your commentary, Mr. Are'bal! Your Benevolence, do you need to revise your Insight?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">It would appear so.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Well, this changes everything. Let's go over the details of Rayfa's Insight again.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Okay! <thought>I think I've got this down now. Time to find another inconsistency!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">At around 3 PM, my father was waiting in the tomb to make the hostage exchange.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........The call came from the bazaar... ...a place where such sounds as laughter can be heard at any time. Even if that was Datz, he could very well have been laughing like a fool at 3 PM.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yeah, you have a point there.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Horn Head. I'd advise you to think again... Carefully.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...I still think you're getting warmer, but you're still a little off. Isn't there another sensation that could more definitively pinpoint the time of the call? You know, something that could only occur at a certain time?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...R-Right. <thought>Time to review the evidence again. Maybe it will help me spot an inconsistency.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Benevolence! There's a glaring problem with this Insight!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">There is?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You stated that the murder happened at around 3 PM... ...which is right around the time my client arrived on the scene. However, now that we know what the source of the loud bang is... ...your Insight conflicts with a certain piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... I suppose I have to ask the obvious here. What evidence conflicts with the claim that the murder occurred at 3 PM?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">I fail to see the connection.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Me, too.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I believe there's a contradiction here, while the rest of you don't. So, who is right and who is wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...It's quite simple really. There's is already a Mr. Wright, so you must be Mr. Wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Is this any way to treat Justice, Your Magistry?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo, since we now know that the loud bang came from a firecracker... ...there's something that Rayfa said that no longer lines up with reality. Something that will destroy a major assumption about this case.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">R-Right... <thought>I'd better check the evidence again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, I hope you'll answer a little more seriously this time around, defense.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ahlbi Ur'gaid's statement... again?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes. Because to summarize what he said... ...at around 2 PM, Shah'do was surprised by a firecracker and ran into the palace courtyard.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Around... 2 PM?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's right. 2 PM. Not 3 PM.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Are you suggesting...?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I think you know where I'm going with this. Datz's laugh, the cry of the warbaa'd... ...and the bang of the firecracker were all heard right before Minister Inga's death. Thanks to Ahlbi's statement, we can put a definitive timestamp on all of these sounds. Therefore... ...what this vision shows is that it's extremely likely that the deceased's final moments... ...were at 2, rather than 3, as we had originally thought.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">D-Dare I ask...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It means the murder took place... ...a full hour before Dhurke entered the tomb!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">P-P-P-Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaa!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Arngh! ...H-How can this be?! Are you saying that I, the very personification of the law, have been mistaken?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Heh. Now you see why Justice will always prevail!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Peace! Peace, I say! ...Now then, defense. I must remind you that the figure of the accused was clearly shown in the vision. How do you explain that?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I wouldn't say it was CLEARLY shown. After all, the figure didn't actually have a face.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Ah! You are absolutely right. Without a face, we can't be certain of who it was.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Furthermore, need I remind you that if the vision is from 2 PM... ...Dhurke was still with me and Mr. Wright. Which means this faceless figure... couldn't possibly be him!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So then, what are we to make of this one hour difference?!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Wait! T-Two o'clock...? That's when... ...my mother was performing the Rite of Channeling.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...! Th-The palace guards had all been reassigned to guard the channeling chamber for the rite. Don't tell me...!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">The royal residence... it would have been virtually unguarded.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Which means the real killer could have easily slipped unseen into Amara's Tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Defense! Are you saying... ...that this is someone disguised as the accused?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's exactly what I believe, Your Magistry.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......... <thought>He's got a point there. Anyone who knows about the Divination Séance would've tried to hide their face. Nevertheless, our killer openly appeared before Inga. The question is, why?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">.........Apollo. Maybe the killer could afford to be so bold... ...because they knew their face wouldn't show up in the Séance vision.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's possible that the killer dared to dress in Dhurke's clothes... ...and stand square in front of Inga...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...precisely because they knew they could get away with it. But how could anyone be so sure of something like that?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A long time ago, I heard of a cognitive disorder... ...that impairs a person's ability to distinguish between different faces. What if Inga had it?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Then, are you saying that this is literally how Inga saw the world?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes. We can't normally see through the eyes of others, but in this case, we can. And if he had that disorder, I imagine this is how faces appeared to him in life.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Okay, let's say that the killer knew that Inga had such a disorder. They could definitely use it to pin the crime on Dhurke. But...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If you're wondering about how to prove that Inga had it, you already have what you need.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Really?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, defense? Do you have anything to show to this court?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Y-Yes... I believe so. <thought>Frankly, I have no idea what Mr. Wright means, but I'll look the evidence over again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">What explains why the face of Minister Inga's killer is absent in his Séance vision?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Well, Mr. Wright? How DOES this explain things?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why are you asking me?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Because it sure sounded like you knew what you were talking about a moment ago.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I did, but... ...there's no saving face now after your blunder.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh? Um... You know what, Your Magi--</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Have you no shame!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I do now!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...It seems there is no particular reason as to why the killer's face didn't appear.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">No, there is a reason. And I have the evidence to prove it!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Show us what you have.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A notepad?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes. It was found in Minister Inga's room... ...and it holds the answer we're looking for. As you can see, it's filled with detailed notes on various individuals. What kind of clothes they wear, hairstyles, and other discerning physical characteristics.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And this is connected to the faceless nature of the killer how...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The vision we saw was exactly what Minister Inga saw with his own eyes. It is he who saw his killer as a person without a face. In fact, this is how he normally saw everyone around him.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What's this?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I believe Minister Inga had a disorder that prevented him from recognizing faces. It would explain the faceless being... ...and why he needed a notepad full of people's physical characteristics.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........Now that I think about it... ...my father was always terrible at remembering people. By simply changing my hair style, he would fail to recognize even me.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Eminence. You knew that your husband had such a disorder, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">........................ ...He never wished for it to become public knowledge... ...but I suppose there is no use in keeping quiet about it now. It is as you say. My late husband had a special disorder that hindered his ability to recognize faces. The medical term for it is prosopagnosia.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>So Mr. Wright was right!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">The memories of those afflicted with such disorders in life do appear strange at times. There is precedence for this.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So the killer likely knew about the disorder and used it to their advantage.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Right, so they're someone who is both knoowledgeable about the Divination Séance... ...and aware of Inga's affliction. Um, Your Eminence? Who knew about your husband's condition?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">A small number of servants who tended to his needs... ...and me. Surely, you are not about to insinuate that I committed this crime?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, no, Your Eminence. <thought>Still... Could she have done it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ga'ran has an alibi, remember?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, right... She was conducting the Rite of Channeling at 2 PM. <thought>In that case...</thought> Your Eminence, does Nayna know about Minister Inga's disorder?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Of course she does; she is our head servant.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So as head servant, she knew about Minister Inga's condition... ...and as the princess's personal attendant, she is familiar with the Divination Séance. If these two facts together don't make her a possible suspect... I don't know what would!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Facts like...?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">When Inga was last seen alive. You claim he was slain at 2, yet that is impossible. For Rayfa saw him at 2:30.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Ah. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">We DID completely forget about that.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">No, there must be some mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Heh heh heh. So you see, the murder could only have happened at 3 PM... ...the hour Dhurke entered the tomb. There is no other answer to this puzzle.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Argh! Why don't WE ever get to make up answers like Ga'ran makes up laws?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Guess it's back to square one.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wh-Where did we go wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hmm... I don't think we're the problem. We just seem to be short one piece of the puzzle. Our deductions so far explain everything to a T. Everything except for Inga's sighting at 2:30.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I see. And without that final puzzle piece, all of our deductions fall apart.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo, if Inga's sighting is the only anomaly... ...we'll just have to find a way to make it fit into the bigger picture.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Time to think outside the box, then, right? Let's see... It would be impossible to see Inga walking around after he'd been killed. But what if there was a way to make people think he was alive, even though he was dead?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Like a way to make people witness the living dead?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Sounds like some kind of TV show. Things like that don't happen in real life.</thought> ........................ ...Ah. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A-Apollo! Did you just...?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I did! <thought>I figured it out! I know how to make people witness the living dead!</thought> Your Magistry, our deductions weren't wrong after all. Despite minister Inga being murdered at 2 PM... ...he WAS seen heading into the tomb at 2:30. And I'll tell you how!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I certainly hope you will... ...because I have no idea what you're talking about.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The "Minister Inga" Her Benevolence saw was, in fact...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It was someone disguised as Minister Inga.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">But I saw his face. I have no doubt that it was my father.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Then... um... maybe you have that facial recognition disorder, too.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">That's... utter hogwash, Horn Head!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Why don't you prove it then? Would you really still recognize me without these horns?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Hmph. That look you make when trying to dig yourself out of a hole with such nonsense... ...it is forever etched into my brain. I couldn't forget that imbecilic visage if I wanted to. If you don't believe me, how about I yank those horns off of your head? Then we'll see!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">N-No, thanks. I'm kind of attached to them. <thought>Okay, on to the next idea...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Maybe it was a ghost, or even a clone.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........Your Magistry. I fear the poor lawyer must be feeling ill in his tiny horned head. We should summon an ambulance before it's too late.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Agreed, Your Benevolence.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">It was a joke, was it? For shame. You had me truly worried there for a moment.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I'm fine! And I'm done joking around!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It was the deceased being channeled. It's the only way a man who was already dead could've been seen by Her Benevolence.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ch-Channeled, you say?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's right. And there are only two people capable of spirit channeling here in Khura'in. Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran, and Maya Fey. It's possible that one of them was channeling the minister.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">It would seem that you are ever bent on making me party to this crime. Prosecutor, what was I doing at 2:30 PM, the time at which my husband was seen?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Eminence. ...I believe you had completed the channeling rite, and were having tea with... ...the king of the neighboring realm. There would have been many attendants there, too.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Nahyuta has to keep up with her schedule, too? What DOESN'T she make him do?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Then that leaves... only Maya.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yeah, it does... Maybe someone was forcing her to use her power toward nefarious ends. The real killer could've been threatening her.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Th-That cannot be!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So then, Inga's scream... That was probably from when he "woke up" from being called back to this world. After all, that's when the flow of time would have picked back up for him after he died.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So, Minister Inga probably leapt to his feet, thinking he'd just had a nightmare. Then, realizing it was almost time for the hostage exchange... ...he raced off to Amara's Tomb, not even realizing he was already dead.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Th-Then... ...Her Benevolence really did see a dead man running!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...I-I-I... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">U-Using the sacred power of spirit channeling to commit a crime? How can this be...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The defense calls Ms. Maya Fey to the stand!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........Hmm... Well, Your Eminence? Will you allow a new witness?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hmph, it matters not. Either way, this lawyer shall soon know the truth. He will know just how much of an imbecile he is in the face of my infallible arguments.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Insult me all you want, witch, but you'll be eating those words when I expose the truth!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Let us adjourn until the next witness is ready.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Talk about some really close shaves!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Well, you can't get a closer shave than Headsman's brand blades, that's for sure.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The trial's not even over yet, and I'm already exhausted.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Still, you were able to fight back the queen herself in there.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, maybe with Ms. Fey's help, I won't have to keep on playing her game much longer. Speaking of which... I guess it's a little late to be asking, but... ...do you think she's well enough to testify, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She slept all day yesterday out of exhaustion, apparently... But that's all it was, so she should be okay.</line>
<line speaker="???">Barbed Head, Horn Head.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, hello, Your Benevolence.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Princess Rayfa... You were really impressive in there.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I am the Royal Priestess, Rayfa Padma Khura'in! I am prepared to face my father's death!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Despite your mother's opposition, you stood your ground. And in doing so, you fulfilled your duty as the royal priestess.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">......... I-It was... It was all thanks to you and your friends. Your belief in me gave me the courage to follow my path. So... um... I... ...You have my gratitude.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, uh... don't mention it.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I know! I shall thank you with a gift. What would you like? A cow? A horse? Or perhaps I shall reward your efforts with a royal shoulder massage.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, uh... That's okay, Your Benevolence. Your gratitude is more than enough. Thanks.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">But I thought you Americans liked massages. My technique was highly praised by my father, I'll have you know.</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Hey, you! Lawyers! Where's the accused?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh? Dhurke? .........That's a good question.</line>
<line speaker="Datz">.........I blew it big time, AJ.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Datz?</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Shut up, you!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um, what's going on?</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">This scoundrel tried to escape with the accused!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Whaaat?!</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">We were able to nab him, but the accused is nowhere to be found. Where are you hiding him, you miscreant?!</line>
<line speaker="Datz">I-I keep telling ya, I got no idea where he went! I mean, yeah, we booked it together... ...but I lost track of him after that!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">S-So Dhurke's on the lamb now?</line>
<line speaker="Datz">Probably, but who knows? He vanished in the blink of an eye.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">V-Vanished?</line>
<line speaker="Datz">You wanna know something, AJ? Dhurke said to me... "I can't put Amara in danger. I have to set her free before it's too late."</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wh-What? Don't tell me he's gone to rescue her!</line>
<line speaker="Datz">But that's what I AM telling ya! It's why I helped him escape in the first place!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Datz! Do you realize what you've done?! .........Well, what's done is done. Still, why'd he choose to go rescue her now?</line>
<line speaker="Datz">Maybe he didn't wanna die with any regrets or something... Ya know, just in case he ended up on the chopping block.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Why, Dhurke...? I thought you believed in me...</line>
<line speaker="Datz">Aww, don't be like that, AJ! He'll be back as soon as he frees Amara. You'll see!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's not the point, Datz...</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Listen, lawyer. You let us know immediately if the accused contacts you! The trial will now resume. See that you are ready!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wait, the trial's still on? Even without the defendant?</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Those were Her Eminence's orders, so you will return to the courtroom at once!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Let's go, Apollo. All we can do is see where the next testimony leads.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, let us resume the trial at hand.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um, Your Magistry? My client seems to have gone missing.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... What do you think, Your Eminence? Should we proceed without the accused?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Why not? My royal guard is searching for him as we speak. They shall find him soon enough, for they would not dare to keep me waiting.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-Yes, but... what about the law governing court proceedings?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Then I shall simply revise it. As ruling sovereign of Khura'in, I proclaim the following: Should the accused be an enemy of the crown... ...they may be tried in absentia.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........Well, in that case, I guess there's no problem with proceeding.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Will the witness, Ms. Maya Fey, please approach the stand?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sorry to summon you like this, Maya...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Nnngh... Getting dragged out of bed and into court is not exactly a fun wake-up call, Nick.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I'm sorry, Ms. Fey. It was my idea.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Hm? And you are...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, right. I'm Apollo Justice. It's nice to finally meet you.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh, so you're Apollo! Nick's told me all about you! You're the new guy with the loud voice, and a bit of an unreliable streak, right?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">U-Unreliable...?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Um, well, that was two years ago. You've come a long way since.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">So why was I called here, anyway? .........Um... Am I under arrest again?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I guess no one's filled her in...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, she HAS been asleep this entire time.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ms. Fey, this is a trial for Dhurke Sahdmahdi, [sic] and you're here as a witness.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">What?! D-Dhurke's been... arrested? B-But...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>That's not exactly the reaction I was expecting...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ms. Fey, you are suspected of playing a part in the murder of Justice Minister Inga.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">What?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Someone allegedly forced you to channel the minister to obfuscate the time of his murder. At least, that is what the defense claims.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Wait... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! How could you, Apollo! How did you even reach that conclusion?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">S-Sorry! But it's the only way this whole case makes any sense.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your understandable anger at the defense aside, will you testify, Ms. Fey?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Y-Yes, Your Magistry...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Um... I don't have any idea what's going on, but...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... It seems the witness doesn't believe she has ever channeled Justice Minister Inga.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">And if her words prove to be true, defense, your entire argument becomes moot. You do understand that, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Y-Yes, of course. <thought>Hmm... It doesn't seem like Ms. Fey is lying.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Apollo. Maya was being awfully secretive about something just now.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Then I guess I'd better dig a bit and try to get her to open up to me first.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Um... I don't have any idea what's going on, but...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Mm-hm. I was exhausted after being held captive for so long.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That must've been terrible.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya, Minister Inga didn't do anything to you, did he?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Oh, no, it wasn't like that. On the contrary, I asked him for all sorts of things.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Like what?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Like "I'm really craving burgers!" and "I'll die if I miss an episode of 'The Plumed Punisher'!" Acting like a brat netted me a TV and even a few burgers from someplace! He was surprisingly nice to me.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh?! Um... are you sure we're talking about the same guy here?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hmph. He may have loomed large, but he was unexpectedly easy to push around.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Even though he's the one who was responsible for pushing those execution papers through?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Oh, that? Approving executions was simply his preferred method of stress relief.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>With a wife like her, he was probably really pushing them through out of fear.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'm beginning to see why he wanted to stage a coup.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...In any case, my time in captivity wasn't so bad. But of all the things that happened...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...I know I didn't channel Minister Inga!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Don't remember?! I may be 28, but I'm not senile, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Something's not right here.</thought> Ms. Fey, you were confined to Amara's Tomb the whole time. Is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Umm, yes. But I wasn't conscious the whole time.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Okay, then let me ask you something. Did you ever see Nayna in the tomb... dressed as Dhurke?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Huh? ...Is this some kind of joke? ...I think I'd remember if I saw something as crazy as that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Plus, I doubt anyone would carry out a crime like that right in front of a potential witness.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>...I hate when he's right.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">I didn't even have the chance to do something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Not really. Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty much instantaneous. But I was all tied up, literally! So there was no way for me to make the channeling mudra with my hands to do it.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">R-Right... <thought>I guess she really didn't channel Inga then.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya, when mediums are done with a session... ...they can send the spirit back to the other world themselves, right?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Sure, unless they're still in training. Amateurs can get possessed by spirits sometimes... ...but full-fledged mediums can stay in total control of a session. And they can send the deceased's spirit away anytime they want.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So I take you can do that, too, Ms. Fey?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Of course! It's a cinch for the new-and-improved Mystic Maya Fey, Ace Spirit Medium!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's strange. You seem like the same old childish Maya to me.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Grr...! I'll show you childish, Nick!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Besides, I'd never go quietly along with some criminal's plan.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Of course not. Spirit channeling is my bread and butter. And I take a lot of pride in my work. It's like, would YOU use your legal skills to commit a crime, Apollo?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, uh... Until finger pointing and objecting become deadly, I don't see how they CAN be used...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">.........Wow, you're a regular Mr. Smarty-Pants. Just like Nick. Always at the ready with some sarcastic comeback.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I think I'll save my many objections for after the trial...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes, please.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Anyway... I'd never go along with something like murder.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Though, I guess there are some things I'd go quietly along with...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Maya">.........Didn't anyone teach you about respecting boundaries, Apollo? It's really rude to pry into a person's private affairs.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ah, s-sorry! I didn't realize... Um... .........Wait, we're in a court of law...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Yeah, I know.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Then what was all that about me being rude? I'm just doing my job!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...So please, just tell me. What exactly are you hiding?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Sorry, but... I promised Dhurke I wouldn't say.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You made a promise... to Dhurke?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Mm-hm. A pretty big one...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I think this is about all you're going to get out of her.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Y-Yeah...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya seems really confused. But you can't blame her for not knowing what happened.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">True... After all, first she was kidnapped, and now she's wrapped up in a murder case.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">We'll have to fill her in as she gives her testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...You should listen to her, Apollo. I don't even know why you suspected me in the first place. I mean, you don't have any evidence of me channeling Minister Inga, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, umm... <thought>Evidence, huh?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Maya">There's no point in even thinking about it, really. I don't use anything special to channel spirits, so there wouldn't be anything left behind.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's true... Just like when she channeled the high priest, all Maya needs is her own body.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If the defense has no evidence to offer, I will have to end this cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>What now? Even if she doesn't use any special items to do the channeling itself... ...you'd think there would be SOMETHING to complete the deception.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Is there any proof that Justice Minister Inga was channeled?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nope, I don't see how there could be, Your Magistry.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I see you've still got a long way to go, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">E-Excuse me?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">If it were Nick, he would've tried to bluff his way through that one.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>But I'm not Mr. Wright...</thought> ...Um, I'd like to retract my previous statement. And as to whether there is any proof that Minister Inga was channeled? </line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You bet there is!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Really?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, now!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...You're bluffing, I take it?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........I'll be fine! <thought>If we're right, then there must be some sort of proof to back us up. Time to do some serious thinking, Apollo Justice!</thought> Okay, we know that when Rayfa saw her father... ...he wasn't dressed like Ms. Fey, right?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Right, because if he was... ...Rayfa would've immediately known he was being channeled.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So that means... ...he was dressed in his usual suit when Rayfa saw him.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Ah-hah! Good thinking, Apollo. This might be the perfect angle to attack from.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">All right. Let's have an answer from the defense. What proof do you have that Ms. Maya Fey channeled Justice Minister Inga?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, um... About that... *psst* M-Mr. Wright. </line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why are you whispering?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Help me before they call my bluff.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">And what makes you think your bluff wasn't called from the very start, Horned Devil?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">N-Nothing, Your Eminence...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Keep this up, defense... and we'll be casting you off the bluffs of Mt. Poniponi!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nnnagh! <thought>Oww... I'd better think this through again. Even if Ms. Fey had channeled Inga... ... she still would've had to change into his clothes to complete her disguise. If so, where did Inga's clothes go after she changed out of them?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, would the defense care to provide an honest response this time?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Is that... a gemstone?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">We found this among the ashes of one the [sic] tomb's incense burners. Does this gemstone ring any bells, Your Eminence?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Wh-What...! What was that doing in the tomb?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ah, so you do recognize it. But then, as his wife... ...how could you not recognize this gemstone button from your husband's jacket?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Hm? I don't get where you're going with this...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Channeling Minister Inga alone wouldn't be enough to fool someone like Princess Rayfa. Especially if he were wearing your clothes. So you would've had to change into the minister's clothes before channeling him.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">.........Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ms. Fey. You used the minister's clothes as cover while going from his room to the tomb... ...where you burned them once you no longer needed them!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Uh, oh... She seems genuinely surprised by that, Apollo...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Y-Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Do you know my husband's name?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">It was, umm... "Inga Karkhuul Khura'in"... right?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">That is correct, in part. But there's more... Much more. Inga Karkhuul Haw'kohd Dis'nahm Bi'ahni Lawga Ormo Pohmpus Da'nit Ar'edi Iz Khura'in III. That is his true name.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Could it be any longer...?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Due to its length, only a portion of it was ever made public. So, Ms. Fey. Did you know his true name?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">N-No. I mean, how could I...?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Precisely. Yet a medium must know both the face AND true name of the one she seeks to channel.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ah... Aaaaaaaaaagh! S-So then... Ms. Fey couldn't have channeled Minister Inga?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">That's what I've been saying this whole time! Why would I want to randomly channel some old guy I didn't know... ...and didn't like, thanks to that last trial.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I-I can't believe this...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo... I really don't think Maya's lying. However, your line of reasoning still seems credible to me.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I agree, but there's something tripping us up in the details. Maybe we're working off of some wrong assumption again.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">.........Um, Apollo? I was thinking...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Since I didn't channel Minister Inga... ...is it possible that someone else did?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Someone else? But who else could it have been?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I... haven't thought that far yet.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Such chatter is without merit. Let us move on, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Urk. <thought>I don't care what Ga'ran says. I'm going to figure this out. If it wasn't Ms. Fey, and the queen has an alibi, then...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo, forget about who is capable of channeling spirits for a second.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I should consider the circumstances around the channeling, right?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Right. We know Rayfa saw her father come running out of his private quarters. If he was being channeled at the time, who could it have been?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It had to have been... someone who was in Inga's private quarters.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Well, I'm waiting, defense. And you know how much I despise waiting.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes, but! There is someone else besides Ms. Fey who could've channeled Minister Inga! <thought>There is just one more person... And they were in Inga's private quarters. That person is our only hope now!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">So the defense believes there was another. Let's have your very serious answer then.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">With pleasure!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Horned Devil! Who could have channeled Minister Inga?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Augh! <thought>A little warning would've been nice!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">But I thought meting out penalties was my job...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>It can only be that one person. The person who entered Inga's private quarters just before they came back out!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">I command the defense to answer once more.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Nayna...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Eminence said it yourself...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">That's right. Nayna never did go into the tomb that day. Instead, she entered my husband's private quarters.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">How do you know?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">It's quite simple. Shoeprints were discovered in Inga's private quarters. Shoeprints that belonged to Nayna.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">And then there's Her Benevolence's statement. She said that Nayna disappeared right after she entered Minister Inga's private quarters... ...the room from which Minister Inga himself came running out of not long afterwards.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">You are not seriously suggesting...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's the only thing that makes sense. Nayna channeled Minister Inga and left his private quarters thereafter. That's why no one has seen her since... ...and why only the minister's shoeprints were found outside his residence!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">...Ah! No waaaaaaaaay!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's got to be it! Nayna must've somehow channeled the minister...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">All of the circumstantial evidence has fallen into place. You can't ignore it anymore. You can't claim Nayna isn't connected to this case somehow! In light of this, the defense calls Nayna to the stand!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">W-Well, Your Eminence?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">............ Very well, then. Let us call Nayna to testify.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>...Yes! Now we can finally crack this case wide open!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let us adjourn while the witness is summoned.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">There is no need. Nayna is in the waiting lobby.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What? Nayna's here? I thought she'd gone missing.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">It seems she was feeling unwell, and simply wished to rest undisturbed. But her concern for Rayfa brought her here today.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>She took time off without Rayfa's knowledge or consent?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">.........I'm betting there's more to her disappearing act than meets the eye, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ms. Nayna, do you understand why you have been summoned here today?</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">........................ Yes, of course. Her Eminence has informed me that this man here suspects I have committed a crime.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>So this is Nayna... That's quite the hairdo.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nayna">Though I will say......... Heh heh heh heh heh! I suppose I'm not as old as I had thought... ...if this horn-headed nincompoop would take me for a criminal.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">N-Nincompoop...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Isn't that Rayfa's favorite insult? I guess Nayna rubbed off on her, what with all the time they spend together.</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">You there, young Horn Head.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Y-Yes?!</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">You're accusing me of slaying Minister Inga and channeling his spirit, yes? ...What an active imagination you have. Young folk are so wonderfully open-minded.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ha ha ha. Thanks. <thought>Just take the compliment, Justice.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Now, then. Will the witness please proceed with her testimony? This court wishes to know if you did or did not channel Minister Inga in his private quarters.</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">I was feeling under the weather yesterday, and decided to rest these weary bones.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">And there you have it. It seems we have summoned her for nothing. Only those of the royal bloodline have the power of spirit channeling. That a servant such as Nayna could channel spirits is a most unamusing jest.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>On the surface, anyway. But our line of reasoning has led us to this end -- that Nayna channeled Inga's spirit.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">All right, the defense may now question the witness.</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">I was feeling under the weather yesterday, and decided to rest these weary bones.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">I had been feeling unwell all day, and had pushed myself too hard. I kept feeling weak and dizzy, and that dirty mongrel only served to worsen my condition.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">While I sympathize with you, Nayna... ...you took the whole day off without informing Princess Rayfa. She was very worried about you, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">How very kind of Her Benevolence. But she need not concern herself with the welfare of a mere servant such as I.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Except, to Rayfa... ...Nayna's not just a "mere servant."</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">To even think a mere commoner could channel spirits or slay a minister... What hogwash.</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">Besides which, a lowly servant such as I could not possibly be an honorable spirit medium.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">Are you suggesting that my position affords me the ability to channel spirits?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Since you're the head servant to a family of channelers, I'd say it's plausible. If you wanted to, it's not impossible for you to learn through exposure.</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">...I think not. For that goes against the very underpinnings of the Kingdom of Khura'in.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">To become a spirit medium requires a noble spirit and rigorous training. But most importantly, one must be a direct descendant of the founder. It is not simply some hobby one can take up in the manner of knitting or gardening.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So commoners could never become a medium, no matter how hard they tried?</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">That is common knowledge to all who are born and raised here, young Horn Head.</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">Only members of the royal family can learn the art of spirit channeling here in Khura'in.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">I am from a line of humble fishermen, all the way back to my grandfather's grandfather. I've never heard talk of royal blood or noble ancestry.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo. If spirit channeling is a secret art passed down from mother to daughter... ...then even with a royal ancestor, it'd be impossible to learn without the right training.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">It is as the Barbed One says. It also must be mentioned that this secret art... ...is only taught here in the Kingdom of Khura'in, and your country's Kurain Village.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Why aren't things falling into place like I expected...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">I would ask the witness to continue her testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">After Queen Amara's passing, Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran is the only spirit medium left.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">Yes. Oh, she was a beautiful, gentle soul. But she fell in love with a man of dubious origins... ...and was murdered in a terrible blaze. Fate can be so cruel.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Except she's actually still alive.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Poor Nayna's yet another follower unwittingly praying over an empty sarcophagus.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Amara -- the queen who's been locked away, and her existence in this world, erased. But the fact that she is still alive shackles Nahyuta to Ga'ran's will. Nahyuta... The only reason you're still standing there by that woman's side... ...is because you're afraid of what would happen to Amara otherwise... right?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">We need not recount such ancient history. Let us continue with the witness's testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">If you believe a medium to be the culprit, it would have to be that young lass Maya Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">Bah, I know nothing of that.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">No, I'm just quick on my feet when new information presents itself. <thought>I'm also quick to force my biggest smile when times like these demand it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's great that you're following my advice, Apollo... ...but try not to LOOK so forced while you do, would you?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Nayna is right about one thing, though. Only those of the royal bloodline can be spirit mediums in Khura'in. Common folk like us are out of luck.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yeah, I guess so. <thought>Still... ...I think I'll finally be close to connecting all the dots, once I point one very big thing out.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............ <thought>Okay, so I presented what makes sense in terms of a direct contradiction... ...except I don't know how to make it make sense in the larger context of this case.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well? Is the defense going to follow up its loud objection with a sound explanation?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, um... sorry. How do I put this... I believe there's a problem with Nayna's testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Go on.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">She asserted that she could not possibly be a spirit medium because... ...in Khura'in, only members of the royal family can learn how to channel spirits.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I fail to see the problem in that statement, defense.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Hold on -- I'm getting to it, Your Magistry. ............ <thought>Nayna stated an absolute falsehood... ...since we know that Amara is still alive. At the same time, circumstantial evidence points to Nayna channeling Inga. After all, just after she entered his private quarters... ...Inga came running out screaming, despite having been killed at 2 PM. That would mean that Nayna channeled Inga... ...even though supposedly, only those of the royal family are capable of doing so. Wait, wait, wait... Is it too late to ask for a refund on my trip down the rabbit hole?</thought> .........Mr. Wright. You may think I've lost my mind with this bluff, but...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But if I can at least establish the possibility... ...I think it'll give us the break we need.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">.........Wait a sec... Are you going to propose what I think you are...?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Yes. It's a huge risk, but I think there's a chance I can prove it.</thought> Will the court please take a look at this photo?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Th-That's...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">This photo's very existence, to say nothing of the person in it... ...contradicts the witness's claim... ...that Queen Ga'ran is the only remaining spirit medium in Khura'in.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Horned Devil! You mustn't...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, but I must. Under these circumstances, the outcome of this trial depends on it. But you already knew that, didn't you, Your Eminence?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">............</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Will the defense please explain who is shown in the photograph?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The person in the photo is... the previous queen, Amara Sigatar Khura'in. Contrary to popular belief, she was never assassinated. In fact, she's very much alive.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What?! But that's nonsense!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Take a good look at the law book in this photo, Your Magistry. The Mark of the Dragon branded on it... ...could only have been placed there after Queen Amara's supposed assassination.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Rrrgh!</line>
<line speaker="Gallery">Queen Amara's still alive?Has the lawyer gone mad?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........While I personally find it hard to believe... ...I will allow the defense to continue. You may proceed, defense.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara's death was staged to keep her safe from her would-be killer. Yet, according to Dhurke, she is actually being held captive somewhere. But the real truth is that Queen Amara is not being held in confinement! Rather, she walks freely among us... ...here -- in this very courtroom today!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But how--?!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Satorha!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Do not be deceived, Your Magistry. The red pepper is skilled in weaving plausible lies. It is the cunning lawyerly art known as "bluffing." But knowing this, there is no need to fear his forked tongue.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Is that so?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>It's my turn, Nahyuta, to wake you up to the truth right before your eyes!</thought> Queen Amara is still very much alive and has been disguising herself as...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........You mean, it's not?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Looks like YOU'RE the one who deserves to be quaking in his boots!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">F-Forgive me, Your Magistry! <thought>So I made a mistake! Yeesh!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Listen, you putrid-minded lawyer. My mother couldn't possibly be here in this sacred hall.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's where you're wrong, Prosecutor. She's here, and I'm going to prove it to you.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-But that's...!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Gnrk!</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">...Eek!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">This is the simplest and cleanest explanation for everything we've covered so far. The person who killed Minister Inga... Someone with intimate knowledge of the Divination Séance... The medium who channeled the minister in order to mask the real time of his death... Condense these traits into one person and you get a spirit medium of royal blood. And that person... is none other than you, Nayna!</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your true identity... ....is the former queen Amara, and the killer we've been looking for all along!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">Oh my, such frightening allegations!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed! And absolutely ludicrous, to boot! Her Eminence Queen Amara yet lives... ...and is actually Ms. Nayna here? You have truly gone off the deep end!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You don't have to take my word for it. In fact, a certain someone can help me prove it. Your Eminence!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...............</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">If Queen Amara truly is dead... ...you should be able to channel her spirit, right here, right now. Isn't that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...........................Gnrk. I can... deny it no longer.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">!</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">The lawyer speaks the truth. Nayna, the woman who stands here before us... ...is Amara, the former queen believed to have perished twenty-three years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">P-P-P... Pohl...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaa!</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">............</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......... <thought>Finally... We've finally got... Inga's real killer on the stand!</thought> Nayna -- no -- Amara Sigatar Khura'in! Please drop the act and tell us what really happened!</line>
<line speaker="Nayna">................................. ............... Oh, dearie me. I guess I shouldn't have underestimated the power of youth. Well done, young Horn Head.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">! Whoa!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........*sigh* I was getting tired of masquerading as an old woman, anyway. It has been far too long since I last greeted you, good people of Khura'in. It is I, Amara Sigatar Khura'in, your former queen.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Qu-Qu... Queen Amara?!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Wh-Whaaa--? Ah...... NGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>And I thought Ga'ran's makeover was extreme...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Can it really be true? You are alive and well?!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">It is true. I feel as if I have been called back from the Twilight Realm. I fear I have caused all of you a great deal of distress. O ho ho ho ho.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Amara... I'm sorry I was unable to keep your secret any longer. I hope you can forgive me.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">It is quite all right, Ga'ran. I am safe now. For Dhurke, that blackguard who threatened my life, will be re-captured soon enough. I need not conceal my identity any longer.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Qu-Queen Amara! What... What does this all mean?! Were you not killed in that fire twenty-three years ago?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">I barely escaped that blaze with my life. But though I survived, I knew that scoundrel would make further attempts on my life. Therefore, I staged my death and abdicated the throne to my dear younger sister, Ga'ran.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-But the building of that great tomb...! A-And disguising yourself as a lowly servant! Why would you do such a thing?!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">...Ga'ran. I would have you explain.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">I wished for her to be close at hand. It was the only way I felt I could protect her. And it was the best way to hide her from the eyes of the public. After all, who could conceive of Amara lowering her station to that of a servant?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She's got that right. Even Dhurke thought Amara was being held captive in some far-off place.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">He never even guessed she was living as a servant, right in plain sight.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">I must say, a life dedicated to the servitude of others is not the least bit disagreeable. It is a quiet, humble existence -- far removed from the tedium of regal duties. Ah... But those days of peace have ended. And it's all because of you... Horn Head.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You should consider yourself lucky if that's all this ends with.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">If there is something you wish to say, then say it.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It doesn't matter who you are, you won't escape the crime you committed. The defense... moves to indict you as Justice Minister Inga's real killer!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What's this?! You would accuse Queen Amara of homicide?! A grand priestess of Khura'inism?! Y-You can't do that! Sh-She's... virtually a goddess in the eyes of her people!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">If you commit the crime, you'd better be ready to do the time. Be you a priest, saint, queen, or god.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I-I've... never met such an egalitarian person...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara. In your years disguised as Nayna, you would have learned about Minister Inga's disorder. So you knew you could dress in Dhurke's clothes to forge a convincing Séance vision. Isn't that right?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">...O ho ho ho ho. What a curious character you are. You would label me a murderer? Me -- the one who the people regarded as the reincarnation of the Holy Mother herself?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You may be a grand figure in Khura'inism... ...but as a foreigner, you're just another suspect to me.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">......... .........It would appear your words are not in jest. Am I to suffer the sullying of my good name with accusations of murder most foul? ...............</line>
<line speaker="Judge">P-Please, Queen Amara! Forgive his impudence! The lawyer knows not what he speaks!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........Fear not, Good Magistry. For this is the sacred Hall of Justice. Though I am a grand priestess, on this stand I am but a witness like any other. I shall face his accusations with grace and benevolence.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your compassion overfloweth, Your Mercifulness.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">...Oh, young lawyer. In my benevolence, I must warn you that your assertion suffers from a tragic flaw.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh? There's a flaw?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Nahyuta.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Y-Yes, Your Mercifulness?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Who was present in the tomb when the murder was discovered?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Dhurke Sahdmadhi, Maya Fey, and the victim, Minister Inga.&#160;! .........I see. That is a fatal flaw indeed. It appears Queen Amara couldn't possibly have gone to the tomb as Minister Inga.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What? Why not?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Do not keep the defense waiting, Nahyuta. Explain how wrong he truly is.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Yes, Your Mercifulness. Her Benevolence, Princess Rayfa saw Minister Inga enter the tomb around 2:30 PM. Yet you, the defense, claim the person she saw... ...was the minister being channeled by Queen Amara. However, if Her Mercifulness had channeled him... ...and moved to the tomb... ...then, once she was done channeling... ...Queen Amara would have re-emerged and been left stuck in the tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, yeah...</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Had she tried to exit before you all arrived... ...Princess Rayfa, who had been looking down upon the courtyard, would have seen her. However, Her Benevolence saw nothing of the sort.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Urk.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">In conclusion, Queen Amara could not have left the tomb without being observed. And yet, was she there in the tomb when the murder was discovered, defense?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........N-No. No, she wasn't.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Hmph.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Now do you see? Your flimsy claim has been uprooted like a sapling in a flood.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nngh......... Aaaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Well. That was entertaining. Prosecutor Sadhmadhi. Assume the prosecution of this case and clear your mother's good name.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">You wish for me to take over?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Yes. Prosecute your father to save your mother. Heh heh heh. What a poignant fate you bear, but bear it you must. Are you ready?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Yes, Your Eminence!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...And there you have it, Your Magistry. I shall watch the rest of the proceedings from the sidelines. I relinquish complete control of this sacred hall to your authority once more.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-Why, thank you, Your Eminence. Now then, Your Mercifulness. Your testimony, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Now I shall destroy your utterly absurd and barbarous theory.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh, such marvelous testimony. You are truly a treasure, Your Mercifulness.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">This, too, is but by the grace of Her Holiness. No doubt my unmasking here today was Her will as well.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh, my... The Holy Mother, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Yes. Surely Her Holiness has guided me to this witness stand... ...and to the purity of truth!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh, how magnificent! Queen Amara, the Holy Mother's messenger here on Earth!</line>
<line speaker="Gallery">Praise be for Queen Amara! Blessings! Blessings upon Her Mercifulness!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Where did those animals even come from?!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, the defense may question the witness. But remember, she is a grand priestess, so disrespect will not be tolerated. That means... ...no pointing out conflicts, inconsistencies, or any other flaws in her testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Now I shall destroy your utterly absurd and barbarous theory.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">And high-handed, if I may say so. Nahyuta was right to call you putrid-minded. Surely even the monkeys of Mt. Poniponi's holy waterfalls could devise a better theory.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Surely you can steal better insults than "Nahyuta's Best"...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Amara">Now then, to all of you gathered in this sacred hall... need I remind you?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">I was not anywhere near the tomb following the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">If I had been in there, I could not be here today. For the tomb has been under constant surveillance since the murder. I would have never been able to leave.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Hmm... I guess not.</thought> Um... If I might ask... What's in that sarcophagus, anyway? You're still alive, so...</line>
<line speaker="Amara">...There is despair, sadness, hatred, and malice. Only one brave enough to see the truth hidden deep within... ...couldl discover the final hope -- my continued corporeality!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You completely lost me...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">In other words... it's empty. But no one dared to open it because they were too scared of the curse.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Now, will you dispense with your theory? It is as empty as my sarcophagus.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's quite enough! It's abundantly clear that Queen Amara's testimony is flawless.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Oh ho ho. Do you understand now, lawyer?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nnrrrgh. <thought>This is bad. The judge isn't going to let me cross-examine her much longer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Amara should've been in the tomb after the minister's murder, but she wasn't. I don't get it.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">How did she just vanish from the scene of the crime like that? <thought>It shouldn't be possbile for normal people to...</thought> For... normal people... .........Ah! Maybe...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maybe what?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Magistry. I think I can explain why Queen Amara wasn't there in the tomb after the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, defense. Do explain.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I believe it was accomplished through a method only she is capable of. And by using this special method, it would be possible for her to literally disappear.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, don't keep us waiting. Let's hear it. How did Queen Amara disappear from tomb? [sic]</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Maybe she hid in the sarcophagus.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Perhaps next you can explain when and how I was able to escape unseen? After all, the tomb has been under constant surveillance since the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...There could be a secret passage beneath that stone coffin. I've seen something like that before at a magic show back home. </line>
<line speaker="Amara">Oh? Then let us shut you in the sarcophagus and see what happens. Nahyuta, would you do the honors? Go ahead and throw away the key as well. Then we can witness his valiant escape through this supposed secret passage.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">That sounds wonderfully entertaining. I shall start making the preparations at once.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">[[File:SoJ <cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn>.png|260px]]</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...You know what? I think I might have made a mistake there. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Don't even think about trying to escape from your mistake, defense. Now then, I will ask the defense again...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara must've clung to the ceiling. Yes, she was hanging off of it like one of Datz's dried geckos!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">W-Was it something I said?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Nice try, Apollo, but you might want to try a different joke with this crowd.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I-I wasn't trying to be funny, Mr. Wright...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">How dare you compare Her Mercifulness to a mere gecko?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">S-Sorry!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, I will ask the defense again...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">All she had to do was channel someone. Then she could easily disappear from the scene of the crime. After all, she would literally be someone else.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Why, I believe that actually makes sense!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What do you have to say to that, Queen Amara?!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">..................You believe that I, a grand priestess... ...would use the sacred power of spirit channeling to commit murder? ..................</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">! <thought>Wh-Wh-What the--?!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">E-Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Mercy, Your Mercifulness! H-How dare you spew such... vile blasphemy, defense! You will retract your last statement, or face immediate execution!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........</line>
<line speaker="Amara">............No, Good Magistry. It is quite all right. Khura'inism also teaches that we must respond at all times with reasoned principle. Therefore, I shall offer a measured response to his blasphemous accusation.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...You have something to counter with?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Indeed. Now, are you listening? It would not have been possible to simply vanish by means of spirit channeling. After all, it would require a deceased person to channel. However, there was only one murder victim in the tomb. And that was Minister Inga. The only others there right after his murder... ...were Dhurke and Ms. Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Had I channeled Inga as you allege... ...well, the outcome would have been quite odd to say the least. For there beside the dead minister, a living, breathing one would have appeared! Even if I had been in the tomb, there was no one to channel except the deceased minister. So, you see, I could not have vanished by means of spirit channeling.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Gnrk! <thought>That's true, but... ...I can't rule it out yet. Because... Well...</thought> .........What if there WAS another victim? Someone we haven't identified yet.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">How absurd.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">If you channeled someone other than Minister Inga... ...you could have used their identity to disappear from the tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Another... victim?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Queen Amara. Please add your last statement to your testimony. <thought>This could explain everything. Wasn't there some sign of another victim there in the tomb? And yet... why do I sense I'm not going to like what I'm about to find out?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Amara">Were your theory correct, I would have been in the tomb once I had stopped channeling.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Very good. But that very truth refutes your theory. Even if I had channeled Minister Inga... ...and entered the tomb... ...the moment I ceased channeling him, I would have re-emerged at the crime scene.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Precisely. As you said yourself, defense, Queen Amara was not there after the murder. The only living souls in the tomb at that time were Dhurke Sahdmadhi and Maya Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Urrnngh...</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Be it in this life, or the next... ...there is no escaping such simple truths.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's quite enough! It's abundantly clear that Queen Amara's testimony is flawless.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Oh ho ho. Do you understand now, lawyer?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nnrrrgh. <thought>This is bad. The judge isn't going to let me cross-examine her much longer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Amara should've been in the tomb after the minister's murder, but she wasn't. I don't get it.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">How did she just vanish from the scene of the crime like that? <thought>It shouldn't be possbile for normal people to...</thought> For... normal people... .........Ah! Maybe...!</line>

<line speaker="Phoenix">Nice try, Apollo, but you might want to try a different joke with this crowd.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I-I wasn't trying to be funny, Mr. Wright...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">How dare you compare Her Mercifulness to a mere gecko?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">S-Sorry!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, I will ask the defense again...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">All she had to do was channel someone. Then she could easily disappear from the scene of the crime. After all, she would literally be someone else.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Why, I believe that actually makes sense!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What do you have to say to that, Queen Amara?!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">..................You believe that I, a grand priestess... ...would use the sacred power of spirit channeling to commit murder? ..................</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">! <thought>Wh-Wh-What the--?!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">E-Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Mercy, Your Mercifulness! H-How dare you spew such... vile blasphemy, defense! You will retract your last statement, or face immediate execution!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........</line>
<line speaker="Amara">............No, Good Magistry. It is quite all right. Khura'inism also teaches that we must respond at all times with reasoned principle. Therefore, I shall offer a measured response to his blasphemous accusation.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...You have something to counter with?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Indeed. Now, are you listening? It would not have been possible to simply vanish by means of spirit channeling. After all, it would require a deceased person to channel. However, there was only one murder victim in the tomb. And that was Minister Inga. The only others there right after his murder... ...were Dhurke and Ms. Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Had I channeled Inga as you allege... ...well, the outcome would have been quite odd to say the least. For there beside the dead minister, a living, breathing one would have appeared! Even if I had been in the tomb, there was no one to channel except the deceased minister. So, you see, I could not have vanished by means of spirit channeling.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Gnrk! <thought>That's true, but... ...I can't rule it out yet. Because... Well...</thought> .........What if there WAS another victim? Someone we haven't identified yet.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">How absurd.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">If you channeled someone other than Minister Inga... ...you could have used their identity to disappear from the tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Another... victim?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Queen Amara. Please add your last statement to your testimony. <thought>This could explain everything. Wasn't there some sign of another victim there in the tomb? And yet... why do I sense I'm not going to like what I'm about to find out?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Amara">Minister Inga was the sole victim. There was no other spirit to channel until he was dead.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">What on earth could you mean? The only body found in the tomb was the minister's.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Y-Yeah, but... um...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Amara's counterarguments are too spot on for us to rebut.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......... <thought>Actually, there is one possibility.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What's the matter, Apollo? That's one heck of a face you're making.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Oh, no. It's nothing, really. <thought>And yet... that means...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">My husband Dhurke is the killer, but he has fled from this sacred hall.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">A reason? .........Ah! Perhaps...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Perhaps what?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Perhaps to conceal himself and lie in wait for another chance to claim my life.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What's this?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">That was only because he had the audacity to claim, "It wasn't me! You must believe me!" It was my duty as a wife to her husband... ...to bend an ear to him, was it not? Communication after disagreement... is the secret to a long and happy marriage.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Sure, I guess...? What do you think, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">D-Don't ask me!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">That is why I listened to Dhurke. However, he didn't have a shred of evidence to support his claim. It grieves me to admit it, but my husband truly did try to murder me.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's quite enough! It's abundantly clear that Queen Amara's testimony is flawless.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Oh ho ho. Do you understand now, lawyer?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nnrrrgh. <thought>This is bad. The judge isn't going to let me cross-examine her much longer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Amara should've been in the tomb after the minister's murder, but she wasn't. I don't get it.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">How did she just vanish from the scene of the crime like that? <thought>It shouldn't be possbile for normal people to...</thought> For... normal people... .........Ah! Maybe...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maybe what?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Magistry. I think I can explain why Queen Amara wasn't there in the tomb after the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, defense. Do explain.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I believe it was accomplished through a method only she is capable of. And by using this special method, it would be possible for her to literally disappear.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, don't keep us waiting. Let's hear it. How did Queen Amara disappear from tomb? [sic]</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Maybe she hid in the sarcophagus.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Perhaps next you can explain when and how I was able to escape unseen? After all, the tomb has been under constant surveillance since the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...There could be a secret passage beneath that stone coffin. I've seen something like that before at a magic show back home. </line>
<line speaker="Amara">Oh? Then let us shut you in the sarcophagus and see what happens. Nahyuta, would you do the honors? Go ahead and throw away the key as well. Then we can witness his valiant escape through this supposed secret passage.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">That sounds wonderfully entertaining. I shall start making the preparations at once.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">[[File:SoJ <cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn>.png|260px]]</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...You know what? I think I might have made a mistake there. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Don't even think about trying to escape from your mistake, defense. Now then, I will ask the defense again...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara must've clung to the ceiling. Yes, she was hanging off of it like one of Datz's dried geckos!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........</line>

<line speaker="Apollo">...Queen Amara. Please add your last statement to your testimony. <thought>This could explain everything. Wasn't there some sign of another victim there in the tomb? And yet... why do I sense I'm not going to like what I'm about to find out?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Amara">May the Holy Mother rain judgment upon the traitor Dhurke Sahdmadhi for his crimes.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Within the doctrines of Khura'inism... ...we are taught that, upon death, the Holy Mother shall judge our souls. To those of pure spirit, Her Holiness shall be as warm and merciful as the sun. But to those of depravity, Her wrath shall echo that of an angry mother to her child.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...An angry mother? I wasn't expecting the founder's judgment to be so... down-to-earth.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">The scriptures of Khura'inism were the first in the world to be written such that... ...they would be accessible to worshippers of all ages!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wow, that's... unexpectedly progressive...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I guess she's going to keep on claiming Dhurke's the killer until she's blue in the face.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You'll have to find a hole in her testimony if you want to turn this thing around.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>If I ever needed a ghost of a chance, it's now.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So, Amara is claiming that Inga was the sole victim... ...which fits pretty well with what we know.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But was he REALLY the only one?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Wasn't there evidence of another victim besides Inga? Someone that we've yet to discover...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............ <thought>I can't believe I'm presenting this... ...but it proves that there was another victim. Still, the only ones there at the scene of the crime were... N-No! It can't be...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Would the defense care to share something with us?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............Queen Amara. You knew, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Whatever are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...If you won't tell this court, then I will.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, don't keep us waiting.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......This case... includes a second victim. One of the two people found alive in the tomb after the minister's murder... ...was actually already dead.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But... a second victim, Apollo...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara, after you channeled Minister Inga and moved to the tomb... ...you vanished from the scene of the crime by channeling the other victim. That explains why no one found you after the murder was discovered!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Oh, you putrid pepper. Of all the half-witted buffoonery to come tumbling from your lips. But suppose I indulge you, and play along with your little delusion. Tell me, Mr. Justice. Who was the other victim?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">..................... <thought>...Th-There's... no way this can be true! .........But...! .........No, I can't stop now. If this is the truth... it's the only way forward to solving this case.</thought> The other victim who Queen Amara channeled... was...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um, I-I guess so...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">At least TRY to keep up, defense.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>I can't keep stalling... I need to accept the truth.</thought> Your Magistry. </line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Perhaps it is the brain-dead defense that Queen Amara channeled instead.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Nngh! <thought>I can't keep stalling...I need to accept the truth.</thought> Your Magistry. </line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ...I... I don't have long to live. There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">I have one more... big secret. I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying a certain someone if I did.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Wha--?! You can't--!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Th-That's not possible!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The defendant, Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...is the one Queen Amara channeled. He's the other victim!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Th-This is insanity!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">P-Pohlkunkaaaaaa!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A-Apollo! Wh-What are you--?! Do you realize what you're proposing?!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........I don't know when or why Dhurke was murdered. But the facts and evidence speak for themselves. .........And this... This is where they've led me.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...I see. After Inga's murder, Dhurke and Maya were the only ones in the tomb. But if one of them was actually dead and being channeled by Amara... But it can't be... can it?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Dhurke's bloodstain at the scene of the crime was the clincher for me. He wasn't even injured, so how could he have possibly bled that much? The only logical explanation is... ...Dhurke had also been murdered!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...............Nahyuta. I wish it weren't true... I wish with all my heart that I'm wrong! But as much as I don't want to believe it... y-yes... I can prove it... <thought>Dhurke's killer must've hidden his body. It would have to be somewhere nobody would ever look. And there is only one such place...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Y-You truly... have proof?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The fastest way... would be to actually have someone go check the tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Go check the tomb...? But why?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Because I believe Dhurke's killer hid his body here.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">W-Well, uh...</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">You see? I knew you were mistaken about Dhurke's death.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Come on, Justice! Pull yourself together! There's only one sure hiding spot for a body in that tomb!</thought> I was mistaken once, but I won't make the same mistake again.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Y-You would suggest...?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara's sarcophagus... The only place in the tomb that no one would dare to look. Plus, a killer would soon become trapped by hiding in there. But a body... well, that's a horse of a different color. Wh-Which means... .........Urngh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...I-I believe we must search the sarcophagus at once! Your Eminence. Being that Queen Amara yet lives, I trust we may now open it?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........If we must.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Your Magistry, I believe Detective Skye is still there at the tomb. Let us contact her at once, and have her conduct a full investigation into the matter.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">..................</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Now then, Detective Skye. Your report, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">.........I'll start with my findings.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............... <thought>Please, please...! Please let me be wrong about this! I just want things to be as they were.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">.................. ............ A search of the sarcophagus... ...revealed a body that appears to be several days old.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">! A b-body...?! D-Detective Skye... Tell me it wasn't Dhurke. Tell me my whole theory was completely off-base.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">.................. I have a photo of the body. A-And I have positively identified it as... ...Dhurke Sahdmadhi.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Dhurke! N...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ..................... <thought>Why...? Why'd this have to happen?! Damn it, Dhurke! Answer me...!</thought> ........................</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">How.. can this be...?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">The traitorous snake -- the very head of the insurgency -- murdered? Oh, what a joyous day! Those fools shouting for change and revolution... ...will finally return to whatever rocks they crawled out from under. Heh heh heh. Ha ha ha ha! Ahhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........Gnkh.........Nnngh!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......... <thought>Wh-Who... What... ...was I even fighting for?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>What am I... supposed to do now?</thought> ................................. ................................. ................................. <thought>I... I...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">...should never look the way you do right now. .........A dragon never yields. Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get to the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with a truth that is difficult to accept. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>I can't yield -- not now, not ever. Not after Dhurke believed in me, despite knowing what was about to happen. Besides... Dhurke left me with two things I must do!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Are you... all right, Apollo?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Sorry about that, Mr. Wright. But I'm... I'm fine now!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...A...pol...lo......?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Detective Skye!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Y-Yes?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">How sure are you that the body's been there for a few days?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">I'm positive. No autopsy's been performed yet, but I'd say it's been at least three days. Fortunately, the low temperature inside the sarcophagus kept it from decaying... Oh, and the chest area bore three gunshot wounds from a small caliber weapon. I believe they are the cause of death.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">At least three days, huh...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That means Dhurke was already dead by the time he came to visit me back in the States.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Th-Then who was channeling him?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I think it would have to be... ...someone who could get into and stay in the U.S. without arousing suspicion... ...yet also had a solid cover story so they wouldn't be seen as "missing." I believe this is who was channeling Dhurke when I saw him in the States.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I... don't think so, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...You sure? Hmm... I guess it IS a bit of a stretch.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...That's the understatement of the year!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>That's going to leave a mark. There are only a few spirit mediums. So the answer should be pretty obvious.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">The defense will offer an answer within the realm of possibility this time.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes, Your Magistry.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya...? ...Oh, I see. She was being held hostage at the time... ...so it seemed only natural that she wasn't around.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Right. And do you remember what she said earlier?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...So please, just tell me. What exactly are you hiding?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Sorry, but... I promised Dhurke I wouldn't say.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You made a promise... to Dhurke?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Mm-hm. A pretty big one...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Dhurke didn't want his own death to be known. The other members of the Defiant Dragons would lose all hope if they found out. And that would snuff out the flames of revolution for good. Ms. Fey. Dhurke told you to keep quiet about this, didn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">! .........I guess it's no use hiding it anymore. Yes, I promised not to tell. Dhurke made me promise before he died...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So, I was right, then.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Um, Apollo? ...There's... something I need to tell you. It's about... you know... Dhurke's final moments.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">..................... ...I'm listening, Ms. Fey. What happened in his final moments?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">It was soon after I was kidnapped. Dhurke paid me a visit in that tomb where I was being held captive. I'd say it was a few days before Minister Inga's murder.</line>
<line speaker="???">Hey, young lady. Time to get you up and out of here.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">O-Ooooooh... *gasp!* <thought>It's that revolutionary guy...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">I'm here to rescue you.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Y-You are? Why?</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">I figured things were a little too quiet with that stamp-sucking scumbag... ...so I started digging around. That's when I found out you'd been abducted.</line>
<line speaker="Maya"><thought>But why would a rebel help me?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Let's go before it's too late.</line>
<line speaker="???">It already is for you, pal.</line>
<line speaker="Inga">Heh heh heh... Long time no see, ya rebel blowhard.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Inga... I know you're up to something, and I'm going to find out what. Aagh! ..................... .....................Rrrngh!</line>
<line speaker="Inga">Heh heh heh. That's gotta smart. You've become a real thorn in my side, see? So it's time for you to be pushing up daisies!</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Agh... Gah.........</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Dhurke!</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">.................. Heh. Did you really think a peashooter like that... ...could kill a dragon?!</line>
<line speaker="Inga">What the--?! Ahhh............... W-W-Whaddaya, some kinda freak?! N-Nuts to this!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Dhurke was shot several times, but he barely even flinched. He sacrificed himself for me.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">............Hrgh.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Arngh! These ropes! Urrrrrgh! I've... I've got to help you!</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Relax. It's going to be okay. ...Sorry things turned out this way... but it doesn't look like I have much longer.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">No! Don't say that!</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Y-You're a spirit medium, aren't you? Wh-When I'm gone, I want you to channel my spirit.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">S-Stop it! Don't give up like that!</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">If you do, untying a rope like that'll be child's play.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">No... *sniffle* Please, hang in there. You can still make it...</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">P...Promise... Promise me... o-one thing, young lady. I-It's about... my son.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Dhurke... was talking about you, Apollo. He said he wanted to see you... one last time. So he asked me to return to the U.S. and channel his spirit.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...He really said that?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Mm-hm. He also said he'd been meaning to visit you for years, but kept putting it off. And that this was his last chance.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You just show up here without warning after all this time... What gives?</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">I came all this way to see you, son! Come, rejoice!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Riiight... Why don't you tell me the real reason you're here.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Dhurke... You really did come to the U.S. because you wanted to see me.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">.........I guess this means... ...it was Inga that hid Dhurke's body in the sarcophagus after Maya left the tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">.........Apollo. You can't stop now. Dhurke would want you to keep pressing on.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.....................I know, Ms. Fey. And I won't disappoint him.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">..................Defense, if you are ready to proceed... ...I would first have you answer this: Do you believe the accused's death will impact what we know about this case?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Yes, and I believe I can explain everything now.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Your explanation, please.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Dhurke entered the tomb at 3 PM, the time the hostage exchange was to take place. Or rather, Dhurke -- as channeled by Ms. Fey -- did. Now, by the time he entered the tomb at 3 PM... ...Minister Inga was already dead. I say that because we know the minister was murdered at 2 PM. But, there was someone else in there. This person was already hiding in the tomb, waiting to channel Dhurke in place of Ms. Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Oh, um... My mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, and it was mine for letting you take part in this trial.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Argh, if that wasn't who was hiding in the tomb, then...</thought> Your Magistry, I'd like to try that again. When Dhurke arrived at 3 PM...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It was you, wasn't it.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The fact of the matter is, Queen Amara killed Minister Inga at 2 PM. She then went to his private quarters and channeled his spirit. The minister, thinking he was going to be late, hurried to the tomb for the hostage exchange. But once in the tomb... Queen Amara stopped channeling Minister Inga and hid herself. Then, when Dhurke entered at 3 PM... ...she snuck up from behind... ...and forcibly drove Dhurke's spirit out of Ms. Fey's body.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Drove his spirit out of her body? Impossible...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Urgh!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Are you telling me that the extra, pale brown magatama in the tomb was...! That it was...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's right, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. And you've seen one in action before. You saw how the glowing red magatama sent the high priest back to the Twilight Realm... ...and how it turned a spent, pale brown afterwards.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">In other words, the brown magatama found in the tomb looks that way because... ...its power had been used up in pushing Dhurke's spirit out of Ms. Fey's body, right?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I probably passed out as soon as Dhurke's spirit left my body. I was exhausted after channeling him for so long, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">After that, Queen Amara must've dressed Ms. Fey in her usual outfit, and tied her up. I'm not sure where she got the outfit, but we can assume she had it all planned out. Then, Queen Amara must've changed into Dhurke's clothes, smeared blood onto them... ...picked up the knife, and channeled Dhurke's spirit. That's how she made it look like Dhurke had committed the crime! And that's how she escaped -- right under our noses!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........Gah!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">......I don't know, Apollo. The whole thing still seems a bit... far-fetched.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>.........Dhurke. What was going through your mind while all this was unfolding?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nahyuta?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Those dreams of revolution Dhurke was always spouting... They placed nothing but false hope in the minds of the people. And in the end, they were simply fantasies.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nahyuta... How can you--!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Satorha!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Karma has spoken. The dream of revolution has withered on the vine. Its fate is sealed. The other insurgents will soon wake from their shattered dreams.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>No. Dhurke's dream can't die like this. I'm not going to sit back and let that happen. I can't, and I won't!</thought> Nahyuta... Don't forget that Dhurke's been proven innocent. His name is no longer tainted by the charge of murder.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Now the rebels and their sympathizers who have been calling for his release... ...can't be charged with abetting the accused. So the revolution is far from over -- it's only just begun!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wh-What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Dhurke is indeed dead. However... What if it was Dhurke who killed Minister Inga while being channeled by Ms. Fey? And while the crime could have occurred at 2 PM, you have yet to substantively prove it. ...Or do you have conclusive proof that the time of Minister Inga's death was at 2 PM?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">W-Well, no, I don't, but...</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........It seems further testimony will be required of me. As it would appear that I have fallen under suspicion, I would like to state my case.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, the rebellion must be snuffed out once and for all. You MUST prove Dhurke Sahdmadhi to be the foul murderer that he was. And every last insurgent and their sympathizers... ...must be found guilty under the Defense Culpability Act!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">As you wish, Your Eminence!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Why is Nahyuta doing this? Ga'ran shouldn't have him under her thumb anymore. Amara's not a hostage, so what gives? Nahyuta... What's left to chain you to her like this?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well then, Queen Amara. Please proceed with your additional testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Well done, lawyer. You have painted me as a killer with nothing but your silver tongue.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Do you understand now, you putrid pepper? There is no point in defending Dhurke any longer. It has all been in vain.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Let it go, and move on... right? Well, not today.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Amara">Your theories are but a pillar of salt that crumbles at the slightest breeze. But no more. This ends here and now.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The defense may proceed with its cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Well done, lawyer. You have painted me as a killer with nothing but your silver tongue.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">You would, wouldn't you? I suppose you have deceived countless souls with your lies. ...But I should not be surprised, considering you learned from... him.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Him? You mean Dhurke, right?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Yes, the man who deceived and seduced me, a grand priestess, with his silver tongue.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Umm... We ARE still talking about the case, right?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Surely you have heard of a lady falling for the wrong man before? .........Ah... But to think that I, of all people, would fall under that devil's spell...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Wow. How did they ever get together in the first place, let alone procreate...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Amara">I would advise all here today to beware this lawyer's silver tongue... ...lest you, too, be unjustly painted as a criminal as I have been.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">However, you have no evidence proving your distasteful theory.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">What on earth do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Including Ms. Fey, there are only three spirit mediums in Khura'in. Furthermore, when the crime scene was first discovered... ...Queen Ga'ran... ...was with me and Mr. Wright, while Ms. Fey... ...was tied up in the tomb. That means that the Dhurke we saw after the minister's murder... ...could only have been channeled by you, Queen Amara!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">INSOLENT LAWYER.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">EEK! Forgive us, Your Mercifulness!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Really, Your Magistry?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Satorha!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">You lack the evidence to support your claim that Queen Amara is the killer. Which is why you have had to use the process of elimination to zero in on her. It therefore stands to reason that you would have to rule out all other possibilities as well. Well? Can you eliminate the possibility of another spirit medium, defense?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Of course I can't!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Under the circumstances, Apollo, there are two ways to establish Amara's guilt. We either prove she killed Inga... ...or prove she was in the tomb.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......... <thought>Hmm, which one can I actually prove?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara killed Minister Inga! And I can prove it!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Well now, you seem quite confident. How very intriguing. Though I must say...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I can prove that Queen Amara was in the tomb when the murder occurred.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">It seems you are ever bent on painting me as the killer.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, if the shoe fits...</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Very well. Let us see some evidence that proves I was at the scene of the crime. You do have some, do you not?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Yes. Here in this Hall of Justice, evidence is everything. Is it not so in your country, too?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......... <thought>There are two ways to establish Amara's guilt: Prove she killed Inga... ...or prove she was in the tomb.</thought> ......... <thought>Hmm, which one can I actually prove?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara killed Minister Inga! And I can prove it!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Well now, you seem quite confident. How very intriguing. Though I must say...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I can prove that Queen Amara was in the tomb when the murder occurred.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">It seems you are ever bent on painting me as the killer.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, if the shoe fits...</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Very well. Let us see some evidence that proves I was at the scene of the crime. You do have some, do you not?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">There is nothing that proves it was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........O ho ho ho. Did you truly believe you could trick me with such an ambiguously-phrased question? Were I to answer in the affirmative, you would twist my words into an admission of guilt.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>It was worth a shot.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">You should know that you cannot prove anything through the deceit of others. If there is something worthwhile to say, then let the evidence speak for itself.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>You think I wouldn't if I could?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Amara">Now do you see? All is idle speculation in the absence of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">How very perceptive of you.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........In trying to accomplish everything, the killer would have been pressed for time... ...and may have committed an error that could prove crucial to this case.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And sometimes, the significance of certain pieces of evidence can change... ...in the face of new facts and circumstances. Why don't you take another look at all the evidence we have?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You think I'll see something in a new light? <thought>Is there anything from the tomb that's taken on a different meaning now? Only way to find out is to reconsider each piece based on our current understanding.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Furthermore, Dhurke could have committed the crime while being channeled by Ms. Fey.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">I am. I stand firm with the prosecution's original charge against the accused. The only issue is whether that Dhurke was alive or dead.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's a pretty major issue.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Oh, I beg to differ. For here in Khura'in, death is not the end. It is merely a change in one's address, for the Twilight Realm is only the next door over.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Is it really?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">It is. Those who have only recently passed away may call upon you in the night. Such occurrences are quite common in our kingdom.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>She's kidding... right?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">In all the time I've spent here, I'm happy to say that's never happened to me.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Me, neither.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">You need not fear death. Embrace it, along with your guilt. Then may you begin your journey to the Twilight Realm.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Now, let us end this charade. For the eternal glory of Khura'in and its people!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Once the king of traitors has been judged, and the rebellion quelled for good... ...peace and prosperity shall return to our fair kingdom. Then shall the blessings of the Holy Mother usher in an age of eternal glory.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... With Queen Amara as the Grand Priestess of Khura'in once more... ...the people would be freed from subversive elements. Faith would blossom anew!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Oh, you are too kind. But I have no intention of resuming my position as grand priestess.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What...?!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">I relinquished my position as queen and grand priestess to my sister Ga'ran. And now that my would-be assassin is gone, I am truly free at last. O ho ho. Perhaps I shall take a trip, or expand my horizons with new training.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........Q-Queen Amara?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Looks like she's totally over being grand priestess and queen.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ha ha ha ha! In that case, I shall introduce you to some wonderful classes that I am taking!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">She's claiming that all we've got is circumstantial evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, I can't say she's wrong...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Guess it's do or die now, Apollo. Our whole case comes crashing down if her testimony is allowed to stand.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Don't worry. I've got this!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Proof that Amara killed Inga...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Do we really have anything like that...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If nothing comes to mind, Apollo... ...you might need to get some different testimony out of her.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Maybe I should take another look at the evidence we already have, too.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If Amara channeled Dhurke, she must have been at the scene of the crime. If so, she may have left something behind. </line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Sure, but the question is, did she?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, if nothing else, you can always try to get her to testify about something else.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Right! But first, maybe a quick review of the evidence.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara. Does this pendant look familiar to you?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Why, that is...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">We found it in the tomb, and it has the minister's blood on it... ...which means it was probably dropped in the course of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's what I thought, too. After all, Dhurke had said it did himself.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">! He... said that?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes, but it was a lie. Because I believe he was covering for someone.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Covering? How? For who?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">There is a certain piece of evidence that shows the pendant isn't Dhurke's.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Amara:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It seems the strength of my evidence has rendered you speechless, Queen Amara.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">On the contrary. She is merely flabbergasted that you somehow considered this to be relevant.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, look at you. Guess you just have a knack for reading your mother's mind, huh.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">N-No, please! Anything but that!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Aaaaaaaaaaagh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And here's a little something extra.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Aaaaaaaaaaaagh! Stop! I'm begging you!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo. Take a good look at the evidence again. Based on what we know now, there has to be something that's taken on a new significance.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">It would appear... ...that the pendant did belong to the accused after all.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">No, that's where you're wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's a photo of the accused's body, is it not?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes, it is. And I'd like to call your attention to a certain spot in it. This right here proves that the pendant that was found in the tomb wasn't Dhurke's.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes. What?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Why?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Because...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I grow weary of your single-word answers!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Gaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are you sure you know what point you are trying to make defense?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Y-Yes, I do! And I'll get it right this time. I'd like to call your attention to a certain spot on the photo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You will notice an object near Dhurke's left arm. It's an identical pendant, except it's blue.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Oh! Now that you mention it...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Don't you find that a little strange? Why would he own two of them, but in different colors? Here's what I think: The pendants were meant to go together as a pair.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........A pair?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">If the blue pendant was Dhurke's... ...then what about this pink one with Minister Inga's blood on it? Who do you suppose it belongs to?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">..................</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Come again?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Now this is where it gets interesting. When we opened this locket up.... ...we found a faint fingerprint inside. On the back of the lid, to be exact.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">What?! .........N-No...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So now the question is, to whom does the fingerprint belong?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">........................</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara! It belongs to you, doesn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">...O-Oooohhhhhh. ...........................Nngh.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........It seems I've truly rendered the witness speechless this time around.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Th-This... cannot be! Mother! Tell me it does not belong to you.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">...............N-Nahyuta... I..................</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Think about it, Queen Amara. Dhurke must've realized that you were channeling his spirit. And he had probably already figured out who the minister's killer was. And yet... ...he still claimed that the pink pendant belonged to him.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">...! But why would he do such a thing?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You really don't know? He was protecting you. ...Because he loved you. He loved you until his very last breath, and beyond.</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">I have one more... big secret. I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying a certain someone if I did.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Dhurke knew everything -- even that he was being used. But he kept quiet... All for your sake.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">..................Dhurke. Why do you always...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, Queen Amara? Dhurke -- the one whose love for you never wavered all these years... Are you going to betray him now?!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Dh... Dhurke... I... ..............................Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Th-This cannot be... I refuse to accept it!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara, are you ready to confess to your crime?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">..................I can deny it no longer. The truth is... it was I, Amara Sigatar Khura'in, who slew Minister Inga.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Th-That's preposterous! Wh-Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Th-This is beyond belief!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">M-Mother! Why would you...?!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Forgive me, Nahyuta. I never wished to cause you such sorrow. But... I had no choice. It was the only way.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">The only way?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">............... .........So, in the end, Queen Amara and Dhurke Sahdmadhi... I suppose this means that they were unable to reconcile while he was still alive.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I don't think the state of the kingdom or the incidents of the past would've allowed that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">They were prisoners of their shared history, so to speak.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara, there's something I need to know. You had staged a near-perfect crime. So why did you bring this pendant into the tomb with you? You should've known it could come back to haunt you.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........I do not really understand it myself. I had nearly been assassinated by my own husband... ...yet I could not bear any hatred toward him. I was unable to discard this, or part with it for even a short time. As with Dhurke... ...I have never stopped loving my husband for the past twenty-three years.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........Mother.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>.........So she really believes it? That Dhurke tried to assassinate her?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Amara">Your Magistry, is it not time? Time to declare Dhurke innocent? I would ask that you do this for my beloved, who now dwells in the Twilight Realm.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Very well, then. Your Eminence, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, if you have no further objections...</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Arrngh! This cannot be. My mother...?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........I have no objections.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Dhurke, I did it -- I finally did it! I proved your innocence! But............</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, then. Being that Queen Amara yet lives... ...we can no longer charge the accused with an assassination that never came to fruition. As for the murder of Minister Inga, the truth has been laid bare for all to see. Therefore, I will now pass judgement upon the accused, Mr. Dhurke Sahdmadhi.</line>
<line speaker="???">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.....................I... I... cannot accept this!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Is something the matter, Your Benevolence?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Queen Amara is lying! It makes no sense! Queen Amara would not have killed my father!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What's with her all of a sudden? Is this some sort of lingering affection towards Nayna?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............... <thought>Rayfa...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Speak the truth, Queen Amara! Did you really kill my father?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........Yes. There is no mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........She has confessed to the crime, thereby clearing the accused of all suspicion. As such, I see no need to continue these proceedings.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">B-Barbed Head! Horn Head! Are you going to let this stand?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......... <thought>Dhurke's been proven innocent, and he's about to be declared not guilty. Even so, something doesn't feel right...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">.........Apollo. If you have any doubts, now's the time to raise them. After all, the courtroom is a place for finding the WHOLE truth. But it's all up to you.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>There are definitely things that don't quite add up. Does this mean that the whole truth hasn't been brought to light yet? Should I push to continue this trial?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>.........Is this the right thing to do? Dhurke's been proven innocent, so there's that. But... has every last bit of the truth really come out here today?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo, if you have any doubts, you should keep digging deeper. If you can't get to the truth here in a sacred hall of justice, where else can you?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Right.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Your Magistry, I have a feeling we haven't discovered the whole truth. And the only way we'll ever find it is to continue this trial.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Horn Head!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, then. Will the defense please tell us this: What important fact about this case has yet to come to light?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">We still don't know how Minister Inga was killed!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm? I thought we established that at the very beginning?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Indeed. Did I not stab him from behind? Or would you claim there to be another possibility?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...N-No, that sounds about right.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Does it now? Well, this penalty feels about right, too.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...B-But.. I know there's something that hasn't come to light yet!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, you may proceed if you are ready to present a serious answer this time.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">We still don't have a clear picture of your married life with Dhurke, Queen Amara.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........You would have me speak of such matters here? In front of all these people?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes, please. Inquiring minds want to know.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........B-But it's so embarrassing.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">............</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The defense will take full responsibility for my second-hand embarrassment!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Don't worry, Your Magistry. I'm definitely feeling the hot burn of shame right now.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, would you care to try again?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um, Queen Amara? ...There's something I still don't understand. What was your motive for killing Justice Minister Inga?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........That is a fair question, and one that I shall now answer. It was for the future of this kingdom that I slew Inga Karkhuul Khura'in. To avert further tragedy, his death was an unfortunate necessity.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Further tragedy?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Over the past several years, Minister Inga had been rapidly expanding his power. He had established the secret police, and was relentless in his pursuit of the insurgents. He even had the overwhelming support of the people, but still he was not satisfied. Hungry for more power, he began planning a coup d'état.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You mean his plot involving the Founder's Orb, which led to Maya Fey's abduction?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Yes. Minister Inga planned to use the orb to gain access to great spiritual power... ...after which, he would assassinate Ga'ran and usurp the throne.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">His machinations were reminiscent of that terrible tragedy of twenty-three years ago. And as one affected by that incident... ...Amara vowed to never allow a repeat of such events.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Yes, and the Holy Mother delivered unto me the perfect opportunity to fulfill my vow. Security amid the courtyard was rather light due to the Rite of Channeling. And Inga had barricaded himself in the tomb with his hostage, away from prying eyes. I knew I would never again have such a perfect opportunity, so... ...at 2 PM, during the Rite of Channeling, I slipped into the tomb and slew the minister.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">! <thought>My bracelet!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yep. It seems this trial is far from over. Queen Amara, I believe you're still hiding something!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But if you want to keep on playing this game of hide and seek... ...then let's start with that last statement you made.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........If I must. At 2 PM, during the Rite of Channeling, I slipped into the tomb and slew the minister.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Of course I am. Is it not the way of lawyers to gain the advantage by unnerving their foes?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, uhh... Well... <thought>Great. Now she's unnerved me! Focus, Justice! Just look for a habit or tic that shows she's hiding something.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara. You're not very comfortable talking about the 2 o'clock Rite of Channeling, are you? I can tell because a finger on your left hand twitched almost imperceptibly when you did.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Oh?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">And that pose you make... Is there something about your chest that makes you nervous?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">...Whatever do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>The murder occurred at 2 PM... ...and I'm pretty positive Amara was in the tomb at that time. So then why is she so self-conscious about her chest when she talks about the rite?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The Rite of Channeling...? Didn't Ahlbi snap a picture of it?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Queen Amara. I have here, a picture of the Rite of Channeling. It was secretly taken by a certain individual.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Er, sorry. No can do. You see, I, um... I just happened to find it on the ground, so...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Do you take me for a fool?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um, how about we discuss the photo's origin a little later, because right now... ...there's something much more pressing at hand! I believe this photo merits further examination! <thought>I just wish there was more to see in it than darkness and more darkness.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">We might be able to make out a few more details with some image adjustments. Let's ask Ema if she can help.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Bailiff, please summon Detective Skye to the Hall of Justice.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Here you are. I was able to obtain a much clearer image by raising the brightness.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Hm? What's that right there?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">An injury? No, wait... I think it's a burn scar.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Wait a second. Your Eminence... You don't have a burn scar like that on your chest.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">............</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>...What's going on here?</thought> If the person in this photo isn't Queen Ga'ran, then who is it?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Umm...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The two of you look quite similar. But that's no surprise, considering you're sisters. Even the shape and position of your facial tattoos are almost exactly the same. And you are both capable of channeling spirits. Therefore, it would've been easy for you to impersonate Queen Ga'ran.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........Ugh!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara. You have a burn scar on your chest, don't you? Please remove your round mandala so we can see what's behind it for ourselves!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Nngh... Rrrrrrnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggghhhhhhhhhh! Eeeeeeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">L-Look! It's the exact same burn scar as the one in the photo.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I-I don't understand.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>I knew it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So the person in this photo really is...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes. It's Queen Amara.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Th-This is absurd! Are you suggesting they switched places?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Amara's confession earlier was also false?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Mother! What is the meaning of this?!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">.........</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Don't you see?! This changes everything! We know for a fact that this photo was taken at 2 PM... The exact time the murder took place.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-But... ...that would mean Queen Amara couldn't possibly have committed this crime!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Exactly. She now has an ironclad alibi. So Minister Inga's killer couldn't have been Queen Amara.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I-I am afraid... I no longer follow, defense. Was it not Queen Amara who channeled the minister and the accused to stage the crime?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes, that fact has not changed. We have evidence placing her at the scene of the crime. And Dhurke could've only been there in the tomb if she were channeling him. Which means... While Queen Amara did use spirit channeling to stage the crime... ...she didn't kill Minister Inga. His real killer is someone else!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</line>
<line speaker="Gallery">...What's going on here?Was Her Mercifulness covering for someone?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If Queen Amara is not the killer, then who is it?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Isn't it obvious? Why was this rite held in the first place if Queen Ga'ran wasn't going to perform it? Who was behind the two sisters switching places, and for what reason? The answers to these questions, along with the establishment of Queen Amara's alibi... ...obliterate a certain someone else's alibi!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">No, Your Magistry. I could never joke about something so grave. The only one who seemed to have a perfect alibi at the time of the murder... ...was Her Eminence, Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...............</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara, didn't your sister Queen Ga'ran ask you to pose as her... ...and perform the Rite of Channeling?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">I...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">And didn't she also have you drive Dhurke's spirit from Ms. Fey's body... ...and then stage the crime to make it look like he was the minister's killer?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">..................</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">And at 2 PM, while you were performing the Rite of Channeling as Queen Ga'ran... ...didn't she kill Minister Inga while disguised as Dhurke? Well, Your Mercifulness?!</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Hnnngh...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's no use trying to hide it any longer. You need to tell us the truth now!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">M-Mother?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">........................................ Justice Minister Inga's true killer is...... ..................................</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">M-Mother?! No!</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">Haaaaaaaahahahahaha! I-I really did it... Your Eminence! My life is youuuurs!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I-Isn't he... one of Ga'ran's royal guards?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Q-Q-Queen Amaraaaaaa! Bailiff! Arrest that guardsman!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Mother...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ga'ran couldn't have... could she?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Someone call for an ambulance! Quickly, now!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>We're lucky the ambulance made it in time... ...but we've been forced into a recess for now while things get straightened out.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Athena">I-I can't believe what just happened.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Tell me about it. Do you think Ga'ran put that guard up to it?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">If she did, she's going to regret it. No one gets away with something like that on my watch!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...............Poor Queen Amara.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Benevolence...? Any news on her condition?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">She is undergoing surgery at the hospital as we speak. They are giving her a fifty-fifty chance of survival, though.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...That Ga'ran! Justice will be served.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Why? Why did this happen? Ooh... Just as we were finally reunited... Oh, Queen Amara...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Um, what was that about being reunited?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Hm? Oh, it's nothing! </line>
<line speaker="Apollo">R-Right...</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...How are YOU, Horn Head? Dhurke Sahdmadhi was your father in all but blood, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Thank you for your concern, Your Benevolence. But I'm fine. Right now, we still have a trial to see through... ... so that's what I'm going to stay focused on.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Horn Head... You are sturdier than your stature lets on.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Just don't overdo it... Okay, Apollo?</line>
<line speaker="Datz">..................Dhurke. That was a real shocker, all right. Can't believe the dragon is dead.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Datz...</line>
<line speaker="Datz">Say, AJ... I was wondering... When Dhurke disappeared after I freed him... ...that's because Amara turned back into herself, right?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yeah, I suppose so. But I don't know if it was because Dhurke's spirit willed it... ...or if it was a part of Ga'ran or Amara's plan.</line>
<line speaker="Datz">........................Man... Our dream of revolution... Now what're we gonna do? Is this it?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Don't give up yet. There is a very good chance that Ga'ran is the real culprit in all this. And if we can prove her guilt in court...</line>
<line speaker="Datz">...Hey, you're right! That could be just the push we need. The dream lives on!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Yes, it does.</line>
<line speaker="Datz">Ya know what that means, AJ? The fate o' the revolution rests squarely on your shoulders!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Heh, heh. All in a day's work... <thought>Argh, who am I kidding? That's a ton of pressure. But this is what Dhurke gave his life for, so I have to do this for him.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">The honorable rebel Dhurke Sahdmadhi... I... would have loved to have spoken with him while he yet lived.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Really?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">! Wh-Why not? I-I mean, he seemed like quite an interesting man.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Did she bump her head or something earlier?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">The trial is about to resume. The defense is to report to the courtroom at once.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Already...? After what just happened?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The first thing Ga'ran will do is respond to that last accusation. So you'd better stay on your toes, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I will, Mr. Wright. Ready or not, Ga'ran, here comes Justice!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, let us resume today's proceedings.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">............</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh? <thought>Where's Nahyuta?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">I must offer my apologies. I never imagined a royal guardsman would do such a thing.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What? He wasn't acting under your orders?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">H-How dare you cast such suspicions upon Her Eminence!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">It is quite all right, Your Magistry. Suspicion is only natural under such circumstances. But rest assured that he acted alone, for I knew nothing of his plans.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>I don't believe that for a second.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Now then, Your Magistry. Regarding the murder of my husband, Minister Inga... ...I would like to offer a new possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A new possibility, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Indeed. For during the break, the real killer confessed to me.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Bailiff, call the witness to the stand.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The real killer confessed...? What's she got up her sleeve this time?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......... <thought>I have a really bad feeling about this.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...............</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...............</line>
<line speaker="Judge">..................</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">H-HE'S the one who confessed...?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...............</line>
<line speaker="Judge">P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?! YOU'RE the real killer?!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">I questioned him during the recess, as I felt that Amara had been covering for someone. So it was that he finally confessed his crime to me.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">N-Nahyuta... You didn't really do it, did you?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.................. ........................ Her Eminence speaks the truth. ...It was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">N... Nahyutaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Peace! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Are you absolutely certain about this? A confession of this nature is grave indeed!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Yes, I am certain. For I killed him by my own hand.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Heh heh heh. At last, the real killer has been revealed.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">H-How are we supposed to respond to this?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nahyuta! Retract your confession! Now!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........Mr. Justice. It is not yet time for your cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wh-Who cares about that?! Admit it -- it was Queen Ga'ran who put you up to this! She forced you into giving a confession, didn't she?!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Satorha!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">You are out of line, Mr. Justice. Learn some self-restraint.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Arngh... But...</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Or do you have something that might prove... that I did not commit this murder?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I-I... That is... Nnnnnnrrrrrrrrgh! <thought>What do you think you're doing, you idiot!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Truly, the truth can set us free.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Looks like Ga'ran got to him somehow. I definitely didn't see this coming.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Nahyuta, why are you doing this? Why would you sacrifice even your life to do Ga'ran's bidding?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Whatever the case may be... ...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, your testimony, please.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">I could not remain silent while Her Eminence fell under suspicion for this crime.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........You DO understand what you're doing, right, Nahyuta? You're sentencing yourself to death if you're found guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...If that is the court's verdict, then so be it. I must obey the law above all else.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The law, Nahyuta? Or the queen?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Please address any issues you may have during the cross-examination, defense.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Oh, I will! I'm going to blow his problematic testimony to smithereens!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">I could not remain silent while Her Eminence fell under suspicion for this crime.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Yes. And I accept that what I have done can never be forgiven. But I never imagined suspicion would fall upon the queen herself.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has placed the future of our kingdom above his own life. He is taking responsibility for his crime and is showing his loyalty to queen and country.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Without a monarch on the throne, Khura'in would be plunged into chaos. I could never wish that upon my homeland. That is why I had to let the truth be known.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>What a bunch of baloney!</thought> ...I'm going to ask you again, Nahyuta. Did you really kill Minister Inga?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Yes. No matter how many times you ask, Mr. Justice, the truth is immutable.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">It was I who murdered Justice Minister Inga.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">There is no retracting the truth. One either tells it or does not tell it. It is that simple.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Argh! <thought>Why do you always have to be so stubborn, Nahyuta?! I hate how you never listen to reason once you get like this!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I think we'll need some evidence before we can get him to retract his confession. Either that, or we'll have to force a retraction out of him by appealing to what's in his heart.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's not going to be easy either way.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, what was the motive for your crime?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">I had reason enough to kill Minister Inga.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">He had to die for the future of Khura'in.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Minister Inga was planning to assassinate Her Eminence in a coup d'état. I had to nip this evil in the bud, even if it cost me the purity of my soul.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...So you're saying the death of another is a reasonable price to pay to protect the queen?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Long have we remained independent under the authority of our spirit medium queens. We command the people's awe and respect with the power to commune with the dead. Without such a monarch, our kingdom would lose its standing in the world.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But if spirit channeling is so important, why did you have Queen Amara perform the rite?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">I'm afraid my elder sister is quite capricious. She would fulfill her duty only when the desire to struck, [sic] as sporadic as that was. It was, therefore, something she did on a whim. There was no meaning behind it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A meaningless whim?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's hard to press a statement like that.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Now, if I may return to my testimony...</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">I consider it divine judgment cast upon a fiend who sought to assassinate our monarch.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Yes. I rendered judgement upon the minister on behalf of the Holy Mother.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Are you saying the Holy Mother guided you?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">No. Her Holiness would never condone killing in her name, regardless of circumstances. As such, I believe my defiled soul will be damned to hell. But I do not regret what I have done. I willingly sacrificed my soul to protect this kingdom's future.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Argh! Snap out of it already, Nahyuta!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So his motive comes from a place of faith, huh. Why does that sound completely credible when it's coming from him?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, Amara expressed a similar motive.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">As for Her Mercifulness, she is truly deserving of her title.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">My mother was simply covering for me. I am ashamed I let her go so far for my sake.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Precisely. My mother is as clever as she is kind. She sought to conceal my crime by taking all of the guilt upon herself.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Yet another lie... I need to poke a hole in his testimony, but how?</thought> Nahyuta, could it be you...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You didn't realize that Nayna was actually Queen Amara, your own mother?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">That is not as strange as you might think. Much time had passed since we last met, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Right. Twenty-three years ago, was it? When Dhurke saved her after the supposed assassination attempt?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...No, Mr. Justice. It was fifteen years ago that Dhurke abducted my mother.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh? <thought>That's weird.</thought> Are you sure about that?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">I remember it clearly. I was around ten years old at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Nahyuta, please add that last statement to your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">I was reunited with my mother, Queen Amara, fifteen years ago when Dhurke abducted her.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Agents of the crown pursued us relentlessly... ...so we had to live a life on the run. .........Mr. Justice. Know that Dhurke sent you away so that you would not be caught up in that life we led.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I see... Thanks... <thought>I can't believe it's been fifteen years.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">.........Apollo, there's something about Nahyuta's testimony...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yeah, that discrepancy's a bit hard to miss... But what could it mean?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So Nahyuta got to meet his mother... ...back when Dhurke rescued her.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's what he's saying. It's news to me, though -- I had already been sent away by that point. <thought>Okay, now that I've dragged more testimony out of him... ...what can I do with it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You're saying that Dhurke made off with Queen Amara fifteen years ago. But that's strange... Because I heard something very different from Dhurke. He said that they ran off together twenty-three years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...That is impossible. I know for a fact it was fifteen years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, I have evidence that contradicts your statement. How do you explain this photo? Dhurke said it was taken twenty-three years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">He said that...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">He did, but if we take what he said as fact... ...then there's something in this photo that doesn't make any sense.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... This isn't making any sense to me, so I suppose I should ask: What does not make any sense if the photo is only fifteen years old?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Gnrk!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>.........He's definitely sweating bullets over there over something.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo. If this baby isn't Nahyuta...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......W-Wait, you don't think... Did Queen Amara have... another child while she was on the run?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">And just what if... that child were being held hostage... Nahyuta, is that why you obey Queen Ga'ran's every command?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Y-You presume too much...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ahh... And that's why Queen Amara was trying to take the rap as well. To protect this other child.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A child born fifteen years ago... Hmm... They would have to be someone who's around fourteen or fifteen years old now.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........This is just a guess... ...but I believe I know someone who fits the bill. <thought>This also explains the strange behavior.</thought> This is the child who was born to Dhurke and Queen Amara fifteen years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, may I ask you something?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Of course, Your Benevolence.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I, um... I've been meaning to ask you this since yesterday. Did you know about... ...Queen Amara... ...and... about me?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">! From where did you hear such a thing...?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">From Mother... and only yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Rayfa was carrying on about telling the truth to the people. So I told her. I told her what the "truth" really was. For it is up to a mother to discipline her child.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...I see.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.....................I... I... cannot accept this!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Is something the matter, Your Benevolence?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Queen Amara is lying! It makes no sense! Queen Amara would not have killed my father!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Why? Why did this happen? Ooh... Just as we were finally reunited... Oh, Queen Amara...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Now I see, Nahyuta, why you do what you're told.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The other child born to Dhurke and Queen Amara was--</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........I thought you might try to stop me. After all, simply revealing this information endangers who you've been trying to protect.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Urgh.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I think this should make it clear what I'm talking about. This is the chink in your armor -- the reason why you fear for your sibling's reputation.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">A file full of information that Dhurke collected on what happened twenty-three years ago. Of particular note right now is what's written here: "...the sins of the father are visited upon his children..." This deeply-held idea is why you were expelled from the royal family. Which means it wouldn't bode well for your sibling either... ...if she were revealed to be Dhurke's daughter.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Gnrk...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You became a prosecutor to bring down Queen Ga'ran. But at some point, you came to serve the very regime you despised. And that was because the queen found this chink in your armor. That's how she came to use your sister against you.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...I...I...</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Rayfa:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........You are an innocent party to all this. I live only to safeguard the law, and serve the country and queen from which it flows. One such as you, who is destined to ascend to the throne, need not fret over one such as I.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">No... I cannot accept that... What you say is... It's... malarkey... Don't you even care what happens to you?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Before country, queen, law, and everyone's future... ...my personal feelings are of no consequence. That is why I resigned myself to my fate. I know I must accept the status quo without any thoughts of change.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Spoken like a true prosecutor and patriot. I shall continue to rule Khura'in until the day Rayfa succeeds me. For that is what is best for our kingdom.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........I know, Your Eminence.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Yours is no small sacrifice. But I promise you this: In exchange for your life... ...the child shall remain safe, and the kingdom shall prosper.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........That is all I can ask for with my meager existence.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Nahyuta... Is this really the new you? Resigning yourself to the will of another and killing any hope you held for the future... .........No! The Nahyuta I knew would never let himself be turned into this!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Now, Your Magistry, if you would hand down your verdict...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">O Holy Mother preserve me...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's the kind of hope that perseveres through the most desperate of times... ...and it's what binds you, me, and Dhurke together... as a family. I know because this has demonstrated to me that you haven't lost all hope yet.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">When you interrogated Dhurke... ...you confiscated all of his possessions as potential evidence... All except... this.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Did he take your attorney's badge, too?</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">No. I thought it strange, but... ...just when it looked like he was going to take it from me, he changed his mind.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So tell me, Nahyuta, why didn't you take his badge?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You couldn't bear to take it from him, could you? And I know why. It's because this badge means something special to us.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right?</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">"A dragon never yields," right?!</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You may say you've given up... ...but that's not how it really is, is it? You never gave up, and you never will because... ...you still believe that all of the wrongs will be righted someday, don't you!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">..................... .............................. ............Hmph. You are... very perceptive, Mr. Justice.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">It may very well be as you say. Why did I not confiscate this badge? Even I did not know... ...until now. Perhaps... I was waiting for him to save me.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Save you...?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Yes, save me... ...like he did... on that day...</line>
<line speaker="Dhurke">Nahyuta! Apollo! Hold on! I'm coming! What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Someday... ...he would come and free our family from the chains of the past. Perhaps, deep down... ...that is what I believed. I believed in Dhurke... our father.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Nahyuta. I knew you--</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">However! ...It was but a dream. And now that dream has died. Murdered, along with Dhurke! So now, as the eldest, the responsibility falls squarely onto me. ...No matter the cost, I must protect her!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Please, try to understand, Apollo. Understand why I shall bear all this sin. It is the only way!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...B-But!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Such insolence!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">You have wasted more than enough of my time, lawyer. Do you not see the futility of your desparate floundering? The immutability of his duty? It is time to accept defeat.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Arrrgh!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Heh heh heh. Now, watch as the hammer of justice comes down upon your dear brother. Your Magistry. The verdict, if you will.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-Yes, Your Eminence!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Does the defense wish to raise an objection?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Err... Umm... <thought>There's got to be some way to save Nahyuta!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Apollo. It all goes back to that incident twenty-three years ago. It's branded him the son of a criminal.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So if we could once and for all prove that Dhurke didn't try to assassinate Amara...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Right. Nahyuta and Rayfa's father would no longer be viewed as a criminal.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But I thought there wasn't any evidence left... ...because it was all destroyed in the fire. And Dhurke investigated the matter for years, but never managed to learn anything new.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">.........Really? Nothing at all? Could an exceptional lawyer like Dhurke try that long and really uncover nothing at all? He had over two decades, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh? <thought>He's right. I doubt Dhurke would've gone to his grave without discovering something new. He must've secretly planted something to topple Ga'ran with somewhere.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Take another look at the evidence. You just might find what we need to break out of this situation with in there.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">G-Got it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........If the defense is done stalling for time, I shall now render my verdict.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">N-No, wait! About the assassination attempt twenty-three years ago... ...the defense has some new information it would like to share!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You do?! Hmm... While we HAD intended to deliberate that case in the course of this trial... Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Dhurke... Did you leave something behind for me? Is there some connection I'm missing here?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, then. What is the source of your "new information" about the case form twenty-three years ago?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes. Do you recall the traveling musician who died in that fire twenty-three years ago?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">How could anyone forget such a painful chapter in our history? The poor fellow was caught up in the blaze that was meant for Queen Amara. We never knew his identity, though, as his belongings were burnt to ashes.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, about that... The truth is, he was my biological father.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Wh-What?!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Why, of course! With his photo and Her Benevolence...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Exactly -- we might be able to prove Dhurke completely innocent. And that would free her from the infamy of having criminal blood in her veins. Because here in Khura'in... ...we can witness the final memories of the dead!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Wh-What utter nonsense! Th-There... was no evidence left in the wake of that blaze!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's what you think. But Dhurke went to the ends of the Earth to bring this little souvenir back for us.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">H-He did?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yep, and boy is it the best piece of evidence ever. He knew that with it, we'd finally be able to conclusively settle the matter here in court... ...and save his children. Your Magistry, the defense requests that we hold a Divination Séance for this new victim!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Augh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">As the presiding judge, I will now share my thoughts on the matter. The attempted assassination of Queen Amara is a case we can ill afford to leave open. And I believe that the final memories of the victim will prove to be very important. Therefore, it is the opinion of this court that we should conduct another Divination Séance.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Wh-Why you...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Benevolence.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">If you knew the full name of the victim seen in this photo... ...you'd be able to perform a Divination Séance, right?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Of course! Leave it to me!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Thank you. My father's full name is... ...Jove Justice.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...All right.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, Your Benevolence, please commence the Divination Séance when you are ready.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination Séance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The spirit of the victim has granted us a window into his final moments. It would appear the Divination Séance was a success.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............... <thought>So those were my father's final moments...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That baby we saw must've been you, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I will now decipher the experience of the deceased. Are you ready, Horn Head?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Yes, please proceed.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Very well. Here are my interpretations of the facts as gleaned from the Séance vision.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Someone attempted to assassinate Queen Amara by setting her residence ablaze.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...That is everything the deceased experienced in his final moments.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>My father's final memories... They're right here for everyone to see, but... ...can any of them unlock the truth behind what happened twenty-three years ago?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Someone attempted to assassinate Queen Amara by setting her residence ablaze.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Dhurke's fingerprints were discovered on the lighter that was found at the crime scene. However... ...the hand holding the lighter in the Séance vision appears to be gloved.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...Ah! I-I believe you are right. What could this mean?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It calls into question whether the hand in the vision really was Dhurke's. If only we could make out the details a little better...</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Very well. I will attempt to focus a bit more on what the deceased saw. Perhaps that will help refine the Séance vision. Hmm... It does seem that there was a glove on that hand. Still... what significance could that have?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It means that Dhurke's fingerprints got on the lighter at some other time. Somebody could have even put them there after the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">............</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Either way, it seems that I must revise my Insights.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Okay, she's updated her Insights. Time to go over them and see if there are any new inconsistencies to be found.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Someone attempted to assassinate Queen Amara by setting her residence ablaze.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>W-Wait... Then this means that the real culprit is...!</thought> The figure in this vision is clearly not Dhurke. The distinctive band around their wrist gives their true identity away!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........Aaaaaaaah! That design...! I-It can't be...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">This will prove just whose hand was captured in the Séance vision.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Rayfa:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Justice Minister Inga had cuffs with the exact same pattern on them.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-You're referring to the Cuffs of Justice, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes. I hear they're a traditional part of a Khura'inese justice minister's attire.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But what does this tell us...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It tells us that the figure in the vision is none other than Khura'in's late Minister of Justice... ...Inga Karkhuul Khura'in!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">No... Not my father...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So he plotted the assassination of the former queen as well as the current one?</line>
<line speaker="Gallery">Justice Minister Inga...?So then, Dhurke's innocent of both charges?The Defiant Dragons... They've been right all along!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........What you've proposed is not possible, Apollo. For back then, Inga Karkhuul Khura'in... was not the Minister of Justice.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">The justice minister twenty-three years ago was... ...you, Queen Ga'ran!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Whaaat?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh, right... She served as the Minister of Justice before succeeding the throne. I guess she also prosecuted the assassination attempt twenty-three years ago as one.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...S-So then... the figure in this vision is actually...?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Your Eminence! It's you, isn't it...!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Th-This is madness! Why would Her Eminence do such a thing?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Because... ...she would ascend to the throne.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">She wanted to usurp the throne from her sister Amara? That's why she tried to assassinate her?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I-I find this all very hard to swallow.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Your Eminence, are you... ...are you the one responsible for tearing my family apart?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">............</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">And was it you who killed my father? Well, Your Eminence? I'm asking you a question!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Such insolence!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">........................Hmph. Peasants... Always carrying on about things of no import.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...! You... You do not deny it, then...! Y-You concealed the truth, and used me for your own designs?!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Oh, Nahyuta. Spare me your feeble-minded line of questioning.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Even if Dhurke were cleared of all charges... ...it shall still be I who decides Rayfa's fate. You DO wish for her to be queen someday, do you not?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Remember: The child lives only by my good graces. Now, kneel before me and fulfill your end of the bargain by offering me your head!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">........................... ........................... ...Your Eminence. I... am done heeding your commands.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Even as you used my sister against me... ...I still believed you. I believed that protecting your secrets was in the best interest of this kingdom. But you...! You have been deceiving me all the while!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nahyuta...!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Nahyuta! You dare defy me?!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Satorha!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Your Eminence... I can turn the other cheek no more. Therefore... I hereby retract my confession in the murder of Justice Minister Inga!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Retract, you say...?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Dhurke... The final piece of evidence you left behind... ...has released Nahyuta from his suffering. And now, he's finally free...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">In all this time, not once did I reflect on my own conduct -- for I had believed all was fate. Lost in my own sense of resignation, I was unable to wake from my despair. But you, Apollo. You have awakened me with your demonstration of our father's creed. A dragon never yields. I will carry on Dhurke's legacy, and fulfill his dream. Hear me, Ga'ran: I will cast you down from your bloody throne! Long live the revolution!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Rrrrrgh! Insolent fool! Now even YOU prattle on about revolution?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Would you look at that. Well, Apollo... It seems we're finally making some headway down the road that Dhurke carved out for us.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Yeah. <thought>Now, if we could just prove Ga'ran's guilt... ...we could continue on down that road -- towards the revolution Dhurke dreamed of.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-Your Eminence. You have been accused of the crime committed twewnty-three years ago. Would you like to say anything in your defense?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Not so fast, Your Magistry. For the cuffs could have been stolen and used without my knowledge. So, you see, they can hardly be considered proof of anything!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-Why, I believe you're right.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Argh! But we KNOW she's guilty!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Heh heh heh. Well, lawyer? Is there any other evidence you would have me refute?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Unfortunately, this photo was the last piece of evidence Dhurke left for me. So as far as evidence goes, I've got nothing else regarding that case from the past. However, now that Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has retracted his confession... ...we'll have to redeliberate the current case from scratch.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Yes. The defense speaks the truth... ...even though it is clear who the guilty party is.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Ga'ran! The defense accuses you of the murder of Justice Minister Inga Karkhuul Khura'in!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Gnrk!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-But... do you have any evidence, defense?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Evidence that will prove Ga'ran was the killer...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">There is still one more avenue for us to explore, Mr. Justice.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">There is?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Minister Inga's final memories. In them, the minister's killer posed as Dhurke. Therefore, one must ask, how did the killer dispose of their disguise?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Hey, you're right! A lot of blood would've spattered onto the killer. So the blood-soaked clothes would have to have been dealt with somehow. If they're still around somewhere, then...!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Y-Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">On the day of your father's murder, you had been watching the courtyard from 2 PM. Now, during that time, you saw Queen Ga'ran, did you not?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">............Y-Yes, I did. I saw my mother entering the palace from the courtyard. But I was told not to mention it because it had nothing to do with my father's murder.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">! R-Rayfa! Y-You would not dare...!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">When the queen headed into the palace, did she have Dhurke's clothes in her possession?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">.........No. No, she did not!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So... maybe she disposed of them somewhere in the courtyard.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........Y-Yes. I admit no clothing was found.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Heh, so you admit that you were merely speculating... ...chasing phantoms and delusions of evidence that never existed.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>This makes no sense. Clothing doesn't just disappear like that.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If Ga'ran wasn't carrying any clothes, she must've gotten rid of them somewhere. Somewhere where she thought they'd never be found.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Where they'd never be found, huh...</thought> I believe Dhurke's clothes were hidden here.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes, it's the only place it can be.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Where in the tomb do you believe the clothes were hidden?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Augh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And by that, you mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The killer would've had to get Dhurke's clothes from somewhere. Luckily, they were right there!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Yes, of course. At the time of the minister's murder, Dhurke's body was already in the sarcophagus. So the killer could have simply borrowed his clothes.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Right. Before the minister entered the tomb, the killer put on Dhurke's clothes... ...and then hid behind the curtain above the sarcophagus. And after the minister was killed, Dhurke's clothes were returned to his body.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I had thought it was all Dhurke's, but that makes sense. Only one way to be sure, though. Let's get those stains analyzed right away!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Indeed. This may be the conclusive evidence we need to prove the queen's guilt.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>...But could they really? I'd say the possibility of someone other than Ga'ran hiding the clothes...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">No, it's just not possible. Your Eminence. I recall you saying the following:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">The key to Amara's sarcophagus is under the protection of the royal family. My husband and I are the only ones who could open it. Therefore, it would be impossible for some knave to open it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Nghhh!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That was your own testimony, word for word.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Why... you... insolent...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Admit it. Only you could've hidden Dhurke's clothes after they were used in the murder. And that means you are the one who killed Justice Minister Inga.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........I-Insignificant worm... You dare accuse me -- the ruler of Khura'in? Do not think for one moment that such impudence will be tolera--</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Nnngh.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's the end of the line for you, Queen Ga'ran. Time to come down from that lofty throne and face justice!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.....................Ngh. NNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRGH!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Me? Face justice? Surely you jest. You are in no position to force my hand, lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Surely you haven't forgotten about the Defense Culpability Act? "...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty." In short, should I be convicted of murdering my husband... ...your dear brother, who delivered false testimony in my defense... ...shall also be found guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wh-What?! Th-That can't be...! Can it...?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...By delivering false testimony in the course of protecting a guilty party... ...he would certainly be judged by this court as having supported a criminal... ...and the Defense Culpability Act would most definitely come into play.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">B-But that law is so broad that ANYONE could be convicted under it...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">When it comes to the DC Act, even I am conflicted, and yet, as it currently stands... ...it is the law of the land. And as you said earlier, no one is above the law.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Of all the absurd things I've seen, this law really takes the cake.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">N-Now what...? What can we even DO at this point...?!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Heh heh heh... You need not look so forlorn. Dhurke has been cleared of all charges. So let us leave all thoughts of the real killer and revolution in the past where it belongs.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>She wants us to just let her off scot-free? A-And yet... I don't see any other choice...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Satorha!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........We cannot yield to her here, Apollo. If... If it will move the revolution forward... ...I will gladly face the DC Act! Now, do it! Accuse Queen Ga'ran of the crime she has committed!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">B-But...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Such insolence!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">What you speak of is not revolution. Our kingdom will not function without its sovereign. And Rayfa cannot ascend to the throne, for she is as yet incapable of channeling spirits. Thus, to accuse me... is to wish destruction upon our fair kingdom, you terrorist!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">T-Terrorist?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">If you would still insist on accusing me... ...then as ruling sovereign of Khura'in, I proclaim the following: All who imperil the crown, no matter the reason... ...shall be subject to immediate execution upon the queen's orders!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What? Immediate execution?!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Do you still not comprehend? Then let me be clear: for the sake of this kingdom's future... ...and in accordance with the laws of Khura'in, I command that you be put to death at once!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Nrgk!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wh-What the--!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Nngh!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Heh heh heh heh heh... Haaa ha ha ha ha ha ha!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I-I-Isn't this going a bit too far?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why is the Ga'ran Royal Guard--?!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Heh heh heh. They were on standby in case of an attack by foolishly optimistic terrorists. Now, if you would continue to oppose me -- the very embodiment of the law... ...then under my regal authority, you shall all be put to death! Haaaa ha ha ha ha ha ha!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">B-But...!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">P-Please, Apollo... Do not make this any worse than it already is... I cannot lose you to the Twilight Realm, too...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Argh! What am I supposed to do! How do I win against an opponent that can rewrite the law as she sees fit?! How can I ever bring her to justice?! Is this really... how it all ends...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Heh heh heh. It is your life or your accusation, lawyer. You cannot hope for both. ...It is time to cease this insanity.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>What do I do? Should I accuse Queen Ga'ran?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............... <thought>I know what I have to do.</thought> ...Mr. Wright. You know that saying you're constantly reminding me and Athena of? "The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles."</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">! You never fail to surprise me, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">And Nahyuta... You know that creed we've known ever since we were kids? "A dragon never yields."</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...! Apollo...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">They are not merely words. They are what's carried us this far. So now, it's time to honor these words and the memories of the ones who gave them to us.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...I couldn't agree with you more, Apollo. Those words are more important to me than you know. And if there's any time to remember them, it's now.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">............It would seem, Apollo... ...that not one, but two auspicious creatures dwell deep within you: A fierce dragon and a virtuous phoenix that shall scatter the clouds hiding the heavens! ...I shall join you in your death-defying bluff!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">A-Are you smiling? Even in the face of certain doom?! Is there no end to your defiance?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Unfortunately for you, no. I won't let fear -- or even the law -- force me to abandon the pursuit of truth. Because there is another saying in my country: the truth will set you free.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Indeed. That is precisely what Dhurke sought to do through this trial. He wished for us to break free from a certain despicable spider's immobilizing silk threads.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">We won't be intimidated by unjust laws, or give in to fear. Abandoning the truth like that is just not a part of my playbook.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">There is only one path before us: revolution. The time to make Dhurke's dream a reality is upon us!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Eminence. If you are the law here in Khura'in... ...then your very existence is wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">.........Does your desperate bleating know no end?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I know it's a bit late to ask, but what's the plan?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, if Ga'ran is going to execute us on the spot under the Defense Culpability Act... ...and the law itself derives its power from the authority of the crown... ...then there's only one thing to do: We dethrone her -- right here, right now.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">! All right, but how? It's not like we have a lot of time to come up with a way to do it, either. I doubt she'll allow you to perform another cross-examination while we think.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Don't worry. I'll come up with something. We'll be fine! <thought>We can't give up -- not now. We have to keep on fighting to the end! We can't allow these broken trials to go on. It's time to make things right!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">If I accuse Ga'ran, Nahyuta will be subject to the Defense Culpability Act. Which means he will be put to death in accordance with the law. So, the only way out of this is to dethrone Ga'ran right now. Could this be the key to dethroning Ga'ran...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Dhurke was convinced that the orb is the key to the revolution, and Khura'in's future. In light of Ga'ran's obsession with the orb, it makes a large amount of sense. She probably doesn't want anyone using it to gain spiritual powers, and rights to the throne. Inga definitely tried to do just that, but that's where it starts to fall apart. Inga couldn't have channeled the founder, even after abducting Ms. Fey. After all...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The name of the founder is only known to those who become queen. That means the only people who currently know her name are Ga'ran and Amara. So even if someone else had the orb, they wouldn't be able to channel the founder. So that begs the question: why is Ga'ran so fixated on the orb? Okay, let's not overthink this. Ga'ran is obsessed with the orb because...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Could it be? It's hard to believe, but... If she wants spiritual power... does that mean... Ga'ran can't channel spirits...? That would explain why she had Amara perform the Rite of Channeling. Is that why she let Amara live? To stand in for her when the time came to channel spirits? So, if Ga'ran can't channel spirits...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ga'ran's Defense Culpability Act was established under the crown's authority. But if she has no claim to the throne, then the DC Act would become null and void! ...No, not just the DC Act! ALL of the insane laws she's enacted would be swept away in one fell swoop!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You claim the authority... of the crown? You, of all people? That's a good one!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...Have you truly lost it, lawyer?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. I would have the defense explain himself at once.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's easy, Your Magistry: Why is Queen Ga'ran so obsessed with the Founder's Orb? Why did she let Queen Amara live? And why was she was [sic] having Her Mercifulness perform the Rite of Channeling in her place? ...The answers to these three questions point to a single conclusion. A fact that will shake this kingdom to its very core!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">I still do not follow, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........Your Eminence, I have just one question for you, and please be honest. You can't actually channel spirits, can you?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">What?! You believe the queen is not capable of communing with the dead?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The defense will explain himself at once!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">In Khura'in, the ability to channel spirits is an absolute requirement for a would-be queen. But, Your Eminence, if you were incapable of doing that... ...then you'd have no claim to the throne. Not only that, but every law you've passed would be rendered null and void.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">...............</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">And you, the Ga'ran Royal Guard!</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You seem to be rather enamored with the queen's supposed spiritual power. But what if she had none? What if she were just an ordinary person -- a pretender to the throne?</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">That's crazy talk! Impossible! Everyone knows only spirit mediums can become queen!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Ga'ran! If you think I'm just out to defame you, then prove it. Prove it using this piece of evidence you want so badly!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ga'ran:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">All the conditions for summoning the founder should be in place. With the orb, we know what the founder looks like. And as queen, you should know the founder's name.</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Gnrk.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Now, if you would, Your Eminence! Please show us the great spiritual power you bear as Grand Priestess of Khura'in!</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">OHHH! To witness Her Eminence's great power with our own eyes?! Th-The Holy Mother will appear before us?! Oh, great miracle of miracles! Praise be, Your Eminence! May your mighty spiritual power show us the way!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Urrg-g-g-g-gh.</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">Ur dihara Ga'ran!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">E-Enough! Enough I say, you mindless cretins!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-Your Eminence? Can it be... that you cannot...?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">N-No, no! I... I...! I want a lawyer! Summon one at once!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Augh...!</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">Your Emineeeeence! Please, give us a glimpse of your maaaaaaagnificent spiritual power! Summon Her Holiness so she may guuuuuide us!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">I have heard enough from you! OUT OF MY SIGHT! ALL OF YOU!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">If you truly are capable of channeling spirits, then get on with it already, Your Eminence!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Nnngaaaargh... You sneaky, underhanded--! WRETCH of a lawyer!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That reminds me. You said something to this effect earlier: "It is time to cease this insanity." Don't you feel stupid for saying that now?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Indeed. Of all the things she has said, I can think of nothing more ludicrous. ...Apollo. Teach this deceitful, putrid queen a lesson she won't soon forget.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Gladly. Because it really is time to cease this insanity.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ga'ran! Your reign of terror... ends here!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hrrrnnnnn.............. ............... Very well. Demonstrating my facility as a spirit medium is simple enough. Behold! The magnificent power to commune with the dead...!</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! Your Emineeeeeence!!!</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">O great spirit of the founder who dwells in the Twilight Realm. Heed the secret covenant of the orb... and appear here before us!</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">...Ooh. H-Here it comes...</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! .................. .................................!</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrnnnnngh! HAAaaaaAAAAAaaaAAAH... O spirit of the founder! Grace us with your sacred presence! The time is now! I beseech you! Appear before us! ...H-Heed my call! Founder, please! Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrn... NNNRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! .................................... *gasp!*</line>
<line speaker="Royal Guard">.....................</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">N-No, wait! I... I... I was just warming up! The rite actually starts from now! Look! Hrgh! [Foreign text]! [Foreign text]! H-Holy... ...Mo...ther......</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, how is Her Eminence?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">It seems... she now believes that she herself is the Holy Mother.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I-I see... But her attempt at spirit channeling failed, did it not?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...Sadly, she seems unable to accept the facts. *sigh* I fear it will be quite a challenge to question her later.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........And what, if I may ask, was her motive? I understand that she killed Minister Inga in order to prevent his coup d'état... ...but what of her attempt to assassinate Queen Amara twenty-three years ago?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">To become queen herself? Maybe she just craved power and attention.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...She likely developed a psychological complex from her inability to channel spirits. That is why she kept Queen Amara alive to perform the Rite of Channeling for her. In that way, it would seem as if she had great spiritual power. In short, she built a cult of personality upon fear and lies. Then again, do not all tyrants?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...So then, she never really intended to kill Amara, huh.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What I don't understand is why Queen Amara even listened to Ga'ran in the first place. Especially fourteen years ago, before Rayfa was being held hostage. Why would she keep letting the people of Khura'in think she was dead... ...while she kept quietly performing the Rite of Channeling for Ga'ran?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...My mother is a gentle soul by nature, and loves her sister dearly. So when Ga'ran told her to hide because Dhurke was out to kill her, she believed it. What's more, she did not wish to tarnish the name of her beloved sister... That is why she acquiesced so obediently to Ga'ran's request to keep channeling for her. Until she fled with Dhurke and was told the truth, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...So that's what happened.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And since Rayfa was being held captive... ...I imagine Amara had no choice but to help cover up the truth behind Inga's murder.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yeah, living secretly as Rayfa's servant Nayna... ...no doubt only deepened her love for her daughter. She'd do anything to keep her safe.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">All the more reason to hide the painful truth from her.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, that was a case for the ages. Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has been cleared of all suspicion in the murder of Minister Inga... ...as has Mr. Dhurke Sahdmadhi in the assassination attempt on Queen Amara.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then... ...I think it is high time I handed down my verdict on Dhurke and Nahyuta Sahdmadhi.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......... <thought>Dhurke, I hope you're watching. I proved your innocence... ...Nahyuta's smiling again... ...and that revolution you've always dreamed of... is finally happening.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">With this, may I finally say... this court is adjourned.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Way to go, Apollo!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I was on the edge of my seat when those guards stormed the courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That was a shocker, all right. Can't imagine anything like that happening back home.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I know, right? I was ready to go on down there and teach them a lesson myself.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">R-Really?!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I was barely able to hold her back.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Hold ME back?! YOU were about to go ballistic after a while there, Athena!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Yeah, well... I was thinking about helping you smack a few of them down, to be honest.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Remind me to never say or do anything to deserve a Maya-Athena double suplex...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You did a fine job out there today, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Thanks for all the great advice, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Nah, it was all you. That perseverance and never-say-die attitude you showed was impressive. I actually learned a thing or two myself.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wh-What? From me? That's a laugh.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There were any number of times where I wouldn't have blamed you for giving up. But you stuck it to the end and came away triumphant. By sheer force of will... ...and inner strength forged in countless trials... ...you overcame the most desperate, and hopeless situation I've ever seen.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I-I don't know about all that...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I mean it. You've really come a long way, Apollo. I've nothing but respect for your abilities as an attorney.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Really?! A-Aren't you exaggerating just a little bit, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">You did it, Apollo. You finally won his seal of approval. But what about me, Nick? My channeling's come a long way, too. After all, I was deemed worthy enough to be used in two major crimes already!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yeah, and two major chances for me to become someone for you to channel next.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......... <thought>Honestly, I couldn't have done this without the support of each and every person here. Mr. Wright, Athena, Nahyuta, and of course... Dhurke.</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">That was pretty cool, Polly!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Tr-Trucy?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Trucy! What are you doing here?!</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">Heh heh heh. It's maaaagic!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm afraid she employed the old, "Let's Stow Away in Mr. Edgeworth's Suitcase" trick.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Whaaaaat?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Though it certainly explained why my suitcase was so heavy.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Tell me you at least noticed it was heavier than usual...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Umm... Trucy? Do you even have a passport?</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">..................... My magic panties are an extra-dimensional space! It's like a mini-universe in there! I could produce a passport at the drop of my hat!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um, right... <thought>Maybe some things in this world are better left a mystery.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Horn Head! Barbed Head! I am forever in your debt for what you've accomplished in this Hall of Justice. Without your presence, I may have never changed as I have this day. It's pathetic, I know.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.........That's where you're wrong, Your Benevolence. It was you who changed yourself. Only you could choose to defy Ga'ran. And that decision was yours and yours alone.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's right. All we did was present you with an opportunity. And you made use of it with gusto. This victory is yours, Your Benevolence. You should be proud of yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...I... I see. S-So, I am worthy of my title after all. ...Hah. Ha ha ha ha ha! I shall work to heal our kingdom so that it may know peace and prosperity once more!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>She sure bounced back quick.</thought> So, Your Benevolence, I take it you learned the truth of your origins? ...That you are the daughter of Dhurke and Queen Amara.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Yes, my mother... I mean, Her Eminence told me. She said it was a part of my disciplining.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...If you can call it that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sounds more like blackmail. "Keep quiet or I'll tell everyone you're the daughter of a criminal."</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">My mother was so insufferable... or should I say, my former mother.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Sounds like there was no love lost there...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">But you cleared Dhurke's name. My true father will no longer be known as a criminal. Therefore, I have nothing more to fear.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So, what's next for the Kingdom of Khura'in? I mean, you lost your queen, so...</line>
<line speaker="???">Her Benevolence, Princess Rayfa will ascend to the throne.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nahyuta... But she can't channel spirits yet, right?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Indeed. Which is why I will act as regent on her behalf... ...until the day she comes into her own.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Yes, your help will be greatly appreciated, Prosecutor Sahd... Big B...B...</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">........."Buh"?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">B-B-B... Br...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">......... <thought>Is she going to say what I think she is...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Wh-What are you looking at, you... you... horn-headed nincompoop!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Youch!</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I-In any event, I will be assisted by Nahyuta and Queen Amara for the time being.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Queen Amara?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Our country offers consul to the rulers of neighboring kingdoms through channeling. It is a duty I intend to fulfill myself one day. But for now, I will have Queen Amara assist me in that capacity.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So then... she's going to be all right?</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Yes, it seems the bullet went straight through her without doing any serious damage.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's a relief...</line>
<line speaker="Datz">You did it, AJ! Thanks to you, both Dhurke and Nahyuta beat the charges against 'em! And ya got the revolution rolling to boot!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">The revolution... <thought>Dhurke... I guess you were right to believe in me after all.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Datz">Yessir! There's gonna be some major changes around here. The legal system's gonna return to its rightful state... like how Dhurke always wanted... ...and the name of Apollo Justice will go down in Khura'inese history!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ha ha ha. Yeah, right. Oh, Nahyuta, before I forget... There was something I wanted to give you before I head back home.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...You wish to give me something?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes. As Dhurke's birth son, I think you should have this.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nahyuta:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I have to get back to the States... ...and I know you're a prosecutor and all... ...but as the man that's going to change Khura'in, it's only right that you have it.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">...To change... Khura'in.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yeah, in Dhurke's place.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........Apollo. I am afraid I must refuse your gift.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What? Why?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........There is something I would like to show you.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Mr. Wright, won't you and your friends please join us?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh, uh... sure...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Um, so why'd you bring us here, Nahyuta?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Apollo. I want you... to stay here in Khura'in.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What?! But why?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">We have lost our queen, and our kingdom stands at a crossroads. Most of all, we will need to rebuild our entire legal system. Naturally... that includes the reintroduction of lawyers to the court.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">W-Wait, you're not asking me to...</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Yes, I want you to take over this law office. With you as a lawyer, and me as a prosecutor... ...we shall rebuild Khura'in's legal system from the ground up.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Y-You want me to help you rebuild the legal system?! That's a lot to take in.</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Apollo, I cannot do this without you. As a lawyer, you are Dhurke's spiritual heir. And having studied in America, your legal knowledge will be indispensable.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>This is way out of my league...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">The revolution is still in its infancy... ...but it was Dhurke's dream to restore the legal system to its rightful state. Will you not help me realize that dream?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">.....................</line>
<line speaker="Datz">C'mon, AJ! You know it's what Dhurke woulda wanted. Let's do it together!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">You must be taken aback by my sudden request, but please give it some thought.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">O-Of course. I'm honored that you asked. Still... I have my job back at the Wright Anything Agency to consider, too...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">.........Don't you worry about that, Apollo. Besides, this is something only you can do.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Something only I can do...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I mean, to be completely honest... ...our office would be a bit short on firepower without you around, but hey.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>.........Mr. Wright.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Athena">.........Actually! I, um... I'm sorry, but I can't get on board with this.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Athena?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I-I mean...! There's still so much I want to learn from you, Apollo!</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">That's right! It won't be the same without you! And everyone back home would really miss you, too! There's no way I can agree to this!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">.........Still, if you really wanted to say...</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">Yeah... Athena's right... It won't be easy, but...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Athena, Trucy...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Apollo, no one but you can make this decision. Know that I will not question whatever choice you make.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">......Our flight leaves tomorrow morning, Apollo. Think you can make up your mind by then?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...I'll try. <thought>Talk about a difficult decision... Should I go back to the U.S. and continue working at the Wright Anything Agency? Or should I stay in Khura'in and help Nahyuta rebuild the legal system? What's... the right thing for me to do...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Athena">The bus to the airport will be here any minute.</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">I wonder where Apollo is. Do you think he decided to stay here in Khura'in?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">......... <thought>I bet he was up all night thinking. This is a life-changing decision, after all. But whatever he decides, I'll have to accept it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Athena">I guess this means no more courtroom battles alongside him...</line>
<line speaker="???">Heeeeey! Guyyyyyyys!</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">I'd know that booming voice anywhere!</line>
<line speaker="???">*huff, puff, huff, puff*</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Whew, I-I made it... *huff, puff*</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Apollo! You're here! Does this mean you're coming home with us?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well... About that... .........Um, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I've... I've made up my mind.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">......... <thought>Here it is -- the moment of truth...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I... I still have so many things to learn from you! But... ...I've decided to stay in Khura'in.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">You're staying?!</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">B-But...!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I... I feel like I have to pick up where Dhurke left off. I can't let his sacrifice go to waste.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Plus... ...I want to teach others everything you've taught me about being a lawyer, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...A-Apollo!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Dhurke's roadmap for the future... ...and your teachings... I believe that these two things will save the people of this kingdom from further unrest. I want to do this... No, I have to do this!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............... <thought>Apollo... I've never felt prouder. Proud to have had such an amazing attorney working under me.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But......... someday... I'll return to the U.S.! Once the new legal system here is firmly in place, I'll be back. Scout's honor!</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">Will we really see you again, Apollo?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You bet! Not that I have any idea how long it'll be... But I promise you this, everyone... I'll keep on learning and growing. And I'll come back to the U.S. an even better lawyer! So don't you forget about me!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Of course we won't, Apollo. There will always be a spot waiting for you back at the office. In the meantime, we'll be rooting for you! So knock 'em dead!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You got it, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">..................... I'm gonna miss you, Polly... But if this is it... then I'm going to support your choice all the way!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Thanks, Trucy. Good luck with your magic act! I know you'll do Troupe Gramarye proud!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I'll be cheering for you, too, Apollo! But don't think you're the only one with room to grow! The next time we meet, you probably won't even recognize me!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ha ha ha. In other words, game on?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">You bet! And I'm gonna win!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix"><thought>...I'm going to miss you, too, Apollo, but... ...I can't wait to see where your new adventure will take you.</thought> .........Well, there's our bus. I guess this is it, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I'll never forget everything you've done for me, Mr. Wright! I don't know how I'll ever repay you! Here's to seeing you back in the U.S. again someday! Until then... you know where to find me!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The legacy of those who came before us... ...is handed down from parent to child... ...and from mentor to disciple. We must never stall or stagnate, but continue to grow and change. All that we've been taught... The beliefs and convictions that have been passed down to us... We must continue to nurture them so we, in turn, can pass them on to the next generation.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Are you really sure you're okay with him staying, boss?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Uh-huh. I always figured he'd leave the nest someday.</line>
<line speaker="Ahlbi">Oh, I think they're almost here!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Just a little... Got it! ...Huh? Wuaaah! Oww...</line>
<line speaker="Datz">Why don't we go and check it out, AJ!</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">Go on, Mr. Hat. Introduce yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Mr. Hat">I'm the Amazing Mr. Hat! Nice to meet you. I wanted to take this opportunity to announce my solo debut.</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">It seems Mr. Hat doesn't want Apollo to leave him in the dust.</line>
<line speaker="Mr. Hat">We're fierce rivals, you know. I can't let him hog the spotlight!</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">.........Hmm. It's just not the same without Polly, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Mr. Hat">Yeah, I kind of miss him, too.</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">I know! We should go visit him in Khura'in!</line>
<line speaker="Ahlbi">After seeing Mr. Justice in action, I got to thinking... ...what can I do for Khura'in? Then it came to me: tourism! That's what! I'll develop Khura'in's tourism industry and bring in more visitors! I'll roll out a night tour centered on the Founder's Orb... Ooh! And make a museum dedicated to the Defiant Dragons! Boy, the ideas just keep on coming...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I want to congratulate you on becoming a forensic investigator, Detective Skye.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Thank you! ...But Prosecutor Sahdmadhi says he "has need of me." So starting tomorrow, I'll be working in Khura'in for a while.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Look at it this way: It's sure to be an educational experience.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">True... Plus, I can't let that kid show me up, either... I'll see what I can do for Khura'in's revolution!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Heh. Well, challenges have a way of helping people grow. I look forward to our next investigation upon your return.</line>
<line speaker="Betty">Darn that Forehead Face! Ever since he revealed the secret behind our teleportation trick... ...show requests have totally dried up!</line>
<line speaker="Bonny">We'll be out on the street if we don't find some work soon. Maybe we should take Trucy up on her offer. She said we could make our debut as magicians at the Wright Anything Agency!</line>
<line speaker="Betty">Shut up! I'm gonna show her up someday. And on my own terms!</line>
<line speaker="Bonny">Nothing fires you up like a bitter rivalry...</line>
<line speaker="Beh'leeb">Khura'in is just like this child right now: full of life and limitless possibilities. I have faith that Dhurke and my darling Tahrust will watch over them both.</line>
<line speaker="Datz">Har har har har har! Have no fear! We'll see Dhurke's legacy through to the end! And just for junior there, here's the secret to being a man among men: Behold, the Datz Pose!</line>
<line speaker="Beh'leeb">Ooh, it sounds like little Faitah is saying, "No, thanks!"</line>
<line speaker="Datz">Haaar har har har har! C'mon, little guy! Don't be shy!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I've been pulling double duty ever since Apollo left, but that's okay. I'm going to make Simon recognize me for the awesome lawyer that I am!</line>
<line speaker="Widget">She's quaking in her boots!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Tsk, Widget! I can do it! And I will! Mr. Wright will be calling me his right-hand woman before you know it! Let's do this!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Bucky! How dare you deliver my order in such a sorry state!</line>
<line speaker="Bucky">Don't be mad, Siiiimey! There wa'sha huge party at mah shop yeshterday... But, um... It should still taste fine. Here, try some... *urp*</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">You great big pillock! I just lost my appetite because of you! Hmph. It's hard to find good help these days. ...Wouldn't you say, old chum?</line>
<line speaker="Uendo">That trial the other day really inspired me. I've even created a rakugo routine based on Shisho's case.</line>
<line speaker="Patches">It's a mystery story that'll keep flipping the audience's thinking on its head! It's called "The Scary Udon Noodle"! Hee hee!</line>
<line speaker="Kisegawa">Hmph, you're giving away too much in the title!</line>
<line speaker="Uendo">Keeping the Toneido School going... ...is our way of paying penance and repaying our debt to Shisho. And that includes rakugo training for that kid, Owen.</line>
<line speaker="Sarge">Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! With my newfound mobility... ...even ancient ruins and their fancy-schmancy tomb-raider traps... ...are no match for me! FIIIIIIIIIRE!!!</line>
<line speaker="Armie">The university where my father worked is letting me help with a dig. One day, I'll discover an unknown ancient civilization and dedicate it to him!</line>
<line speaker="Sarge">I'll also be going on a dig in Khura'in soon! That Private Justice had better not be slacking off!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">I'm going to be super busy, now that I'm the head of the Fey clan.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Don't worry, Mystic Maya! I'll do whatever I can to help!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Thanks, Pearly! Our first order of business will be to revolutionize Kurain Village!</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Ooh, I have an idea! ...H-How about opening a store where we can buy new outfits like the city girls wear?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Well, look who's all grown up now! But I think there are a few, more pressing matters to take care of first.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Yeah, you're right... I guess it'll be a while before I get my revolutionary makeover.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Mother, Mother! Now that you have stopped being Nayna... ...I want a new Nayna.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">Hmm, I wonder if there would be anyone willing to serve you in that capacity. You are quite a handful, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I am?</line>
<line speaker="Amara">With a simple wave of your hand... ...you would have your attire changed, meals prepared, and even your teeth brushed.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">...T-To think I put such undue burden upon you -- you, a grand priestess of Khura'in.</line>
<line speaker="Amara">...Fear not, Rayfa. You will have plenty of time in which to make amends. O ho ho ho. Perhaps you could start with one of your famous shoulder rubs?</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Her Benevolence... ...has taken to calling me "Braid Head." Even worse, she trembles and her face turns red when she speaks to me. What have I done to deserve such animosity? While it is true that I am merciless within the Hall of Justice... ...to be given such a dismissive name... is entirely uncalled for! Oh, what am I to do? .........Perhaps I shall consult Apollo about this.</line>
<line speaker="???">...How is he doing, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Great. He's a respectable lawyer in his own right. He even has his own practice called Justice Law Offices.</line>
<line speaker="???">...Thank you. This wouldn't have been possible without you.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh, before I forget... I made a copy of this photo for you.</line>
<line speaker="???">A photo...? Oh! ............Jove. ........................ It is so good to see him again...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Don't you think it's about time we told them the truth? After all, they've both grown into fine young people now.</line>
<line speaker="???">Yes, you're right. Perhaps it's about time they knew...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Have you not given the autopsy report even a cursory glance, Mr. Justice?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">A-ha ha. It's just, I have fifteen clients on my plate right now... ...though I probably shouldn't have accepted all fifteen at the same time...</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Satorha!</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Oh, please. Are you going to help me rebuild Khura'in's legal system or not? If you are, we need to move through this case backlog faster.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Y-Yeah, I know, but...</line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">Besides, those fifteen are only the beginning. There are ten more awaiting your services.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I, too, have friends and acquaintances seeking legal representation. And being that you are the only lawyer in the country, I told them to contact you. I estimate it will only add about sixteen clients to your caseload.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh? Huh? N-Now, wait just one minute...</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">I have been handing out advertisements for your new office. They read: "From legal advice to investigating extramarital affairs -- even yak mailking! For a limited time only, these services and more are free down at Justice Law Offices!" I have already received requests from 380 new clients.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............... <thought>I... I'm going to have to say something, aren't I?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nahyuta">.........Heh. I trust you did your "Chords of Steel" exercises this morning. Well, go on. There is no need to hold back.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ha ha ha ha! Now that you mention it, we have yet to hear you shout today.</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Yes, and I have grown quite drowsy from these tedious proceedings. I could use a loud something to wake me up. Do not disappoint me, Horn Head.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh, um... That was one of my "Chords of Steel" voice training exercises.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Well, from now on, you shall keep such caterwauling out of this sacred hall.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Ugh... Guess I'd better take it down a notch.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hmph. I thought nothing of the sort.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sorry, Apollo, but I have to agree with her.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What? Really?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... It would seem that the only thing that could be considered odd... ...is the defense's statement.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Just great. Now the judge thinks I'm even odder than before.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Ga'ran">Hmph. Such items are unworthy of my eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Well, if Her Eminence says so, then I suppose there is no point in wasting time on it.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Come on! Don't I deserve at least a cursory glance?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Rayfa">Oh? Please, do tell: Where exactly does this inconsistency lie, Horn Head?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Well, it's kind of hard to say, especially when you put me on the spot like this.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The defense will only present opinions that won't collapse under pressure.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Guess I'd better take a closer look at the Insights and the vision before I try again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You okay there, Apollo? I get the feeling we still don't have all the facts.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...You're right. Thanks, Mr. Wright! <thought>Okay, let's see what a little pressing does for me.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Looks like you're having a tough time there, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Is it that obvious?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, I've been watching you defend since you first started, so... yeah... And from where I sit, I wonder if there isn't something about that one statement...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Now that you mentioned it... Thanks, Mr. Wright! <thought>Now, to take another look at the evidence.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What's wrong, Apollo? Can't find any inconsistencies?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Yeah, basically.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, there was one thing that stuck out at me. That man's voice Inga heard... Didn't you find it a bit strange?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Not really? It's just Dhurke arriving for the hostage exchange, right?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But if Inga was waiting for Dhurke... ...don't you think he would've been more vigilant?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Good point. He wouldn't have wanted to leave his back exposed like that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Now, just take that thought on through to the end.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">R-Right. I think I've got it now.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>Argh... There doesn't seem to be any inconsistencies here.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You look like you're struggling there, Apollo. Are you sure there's nothing new to learn from the sensations in Rayfa's refined vision? Let's take another look at Rayfa's Insights, keeping in mind the sounds from the phone.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Got it. <thought>Okay, let's try that again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Apollo"><thought>.........There's nothing here!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Looks like you could use a sounding board, so how's this? We now know that the loud explosion was a firecracker that Datz threw. That very fact may have produced an inconsistency somewhere.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Y-You're right! I'm going to take another look at Rayfa's Insights!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Mr. Wright...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You look like you could use a hand. Personally, there is one insight I'm not so sure about. The one about Dhurke's fingerprints... There was nothing there that bothered you?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Now that you mention it... Okay, I'll take another look at the vision with that in mind.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You look like the world's about to end there, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh? Oh... Am I really that transparent?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Refining the vision made the images we see clearer... ...which means there might be things in it now that we couldn't see before.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Right. I'll take another good look at the visuals then!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I have heard enough! This trial need not be drawn out any longer. Regarding the murder of Minister Inga and the assassination of Queen Amara... ...the defense has failed to counter the charges filed by the prosecution. I will now pass judgment on the accused, Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...and his defenders, Apollo Justice and Phoenix Wright. This court finds these three individuals...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I have heard enough! This trial need not be drawn out any longer. Though a few issues remain unresolved... ...this court will leave such matters to the police for further investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">In the end, we never did get the truth out of Queen Amara. Minister Inga's true killer disappeared into the shadows of Khura'inese history... ...and Dhurke was found guilty of a twenty-three-year-old crime. After all that... The truth we'd been seeking... was lost for all time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I have heard enough! This trial need not be drawn out any longer. Though a few issues remain unresolved... ...this court will leave such matters to the police for further investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Because of this trial... ...Queen Amara would go on to be tried for the murder of Minister Inga... ...while Dhurke was found guilty of the incident from twenty-three years ago. The truth we'd been seeking... was lost for all time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I have heard enough! This trial needs not to be drawn out any longer. In light of the fact that Queen Amara is still alive and well... ...the charge of murder against the accused, Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...for the attempted assassination twenty-three years ago will be dropped. However, with regard to the murder of Minister Inga... ...the defense has failed to invalidate the confession of Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Therefore, this court must accept his confession, and hand down its verdict.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I have heard enough! This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to sufficiently establish Queen Ga'ran's culpability. Though a few issues remain unresolved... ...this court will leave such matters to the police for further investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">This trial may have proven Dhurke's innocence... ...but we failed to prove who Minister Inga's true killer was. And the truth of what happened twenty-three years ago will remain shrouded in mystery. It was all because we failed to prove Ga'ran's guilt. After that trial, we were forced underground in order to escape Ga'ran's agents... ...and I joined Nahyuta and the Defiant Dragons in their efforts to overthrow Ga'ran. A dragon never yields... We fight on with Dhurke's creed in our hearts. And dream of the day revolution comes to Khura'in...</line>
