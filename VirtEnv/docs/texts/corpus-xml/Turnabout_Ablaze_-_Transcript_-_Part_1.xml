<title>Turnabout Ablaze</title>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's so nice, almost dreamlike, to finally have the chance to relax and sip some tea. Especially after what a whirlwind the past few days have been.</thought> On my return flight, I was dragged into a case involving an Interpol agent's murder. The next day, I investigated a kidnapping and a murder at the Gatewater Land theme park. And later that night, a detective's dead body welcomed me back to my office... ...along with a thief who was out to pilfer files related to a case from 10 years ago. <thought>How did I manage to find myself in the middle of so many cases back to back? Well, at least I have today. All I ask is that I be allowed to spend it quietly.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgewooooorth! This is big! Big, I tell you! ...Hey, what's wrong with you? Where's your enthusiasm...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And suddenly, the phrase "the fragility of dreams" comes to mind...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What are you talking about, "fragile dreams"!? Come on, let's go! The fake Yatagarasu isn't going to just find herself, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, if you must know... it's possible that I was paid a visit last night by your "fake".</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Say what?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Unfortunately for us, the thief managed to escape. But even now, we're still looking for this criminal. However, I must warn you that we've only had a few hours to search so far... ...so I must insist that you be patient on this one, Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wh-What's with you today...? Are you sure you aren't sleep-talking to me right now? Anyway, I've got something much more important that I want you to see!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh, and that is?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Take a look at this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"On March 14th, I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret." That's quite a bold declaration to send to an embassy... <thought>I suppose it was inevitable that a newspaper would catch wind of this.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">The date the card mentions is today!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Today, huh...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Come on, we've gotta hurry! The embassy awaits!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose it IS quite an urgent matter... ...however, do you know which country's embassy we should be investigating?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, it's some really special country, and I'm actually really fuzzy on the details... But never mind that! Where's all your energy!? Why are you so lackadaisical today!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm not, Kay. You're just too wound up.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, then you should get too wound up, too! Because this just might be our chance to catch that woman!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You mean Ms. Yew? <thought>The woman who killed Kay's father, Byrne Faraday, seven years ago... Calisto Yew... She claimed to be the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and then disappeared from the courtroom.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Argh! She makes me so mad! The phony! Everyone knows that the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a calling card! Until a company's underhanded dealings are made public... ...the target is always totally unaware that the Yatagarasu has paid them a visit. That's what makes the real Yatagarasu so awesome!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... The Yatagarasu's card that's shown in this article... It looks to me as though it could be genuine.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">See, that's the thing. Whoever it is, that person isn't the real deal, but has knowledge of the Yatagarasu. If this isn't a clue that that woman's involved, then nothing is! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Out the door you go!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wait, there are a few preparations I must make before we go... <thought>There's something interesting about this card we found last night here in my office... It's of a different color than the one in the article, which makes me wonder why.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">What's up? Any reason why you're boring a hole through the newspaper with your eyes?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No... No reason at all. Very well. Seeing as how Ms. Yew is also someone of a special nature to me... ...I agree there is some merit to be found in investigating this.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I knew you'd come around!</line>
<line speaker="S.Samurai">By the light of this night's glorious moon... We are ready!</line>
<line speaker="P.Princess">Ready to embark on our nightly outing.</line>
<line speaker="S.Samurai">And this is where... ...our tale begins!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... What a coincidence. Who would've thought that a Steel Samurai stage show... ...would ever be held at such an elegant theater inside a foreign embassy?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah! The climax was really awesome! "Steel Samurai Sushi Slice!" I got chills down my spine when he pulled that move out!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose it really is more impactful to watch a show in person than on television.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I have to say, though, this embassy is set up kinda funny. I mean, they have two countries sharing the same building!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, as you said yourself, this place and the countries it houses are very special. Even this theater is special in that it is a neutral zone shared by the two countries.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm... So, let me get this straight... The Steel Samurai show just now is being sponsored by one of the two countries. The one that's called the Kingdom of Allebahst, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, it would appear that the Steel Samurai is very popular in that country as well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Seems that way! But you know who I'M really into? The Jammin' Ninja! The Republic of Babahl is sponsoring a Jammin' Ninja stage show! That's something for fangirls like me! We've totally gotta see that too, Mr. Edgeworth! The Jammin' Ninja's show is gonna kick the Steel Samurai show's rear end!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>You know, ever since I first met this girl, I've always had this inkling... ...that what she really wants to be... ...is not a thief, but rather, a ninja...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So anyway, about today's event... umm... What's it called again?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"The Kingdom of Allebahst versus The Republic of Babahl Goodwill Jubilee". The small, European countries of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...and the Republic of Babahl. These two countries used to be a single entity that was abundant with nature. And it was called... the Principality of Cohdopia. ..................</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hm? Is everything alright, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I'm alright. Moving on... After a period of civil unrest, the country split in two, though signs of their past remain. For example, their flags preserve the flower and butterfly motifs to this day. ......... <thought>Cohdopia, huh... The KG-8 Incident... and what was referred to as the second KG-8 Incident... ...in which an Embassy staff member was murdered... Both of these cases were related to the Principality of Cohdopia. In the seven years that have passed, the country may have split into two... ...however, the Yatagarasu still sent a calling card here. What could it all mean?</thought> .........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... I know you're thinking about something!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh, excuse me. What were we talking about again?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Argh, if you could please stop spacing out on me! Anyway, we were talking about the Allebahst versus Babahl Goodwill Jubilee. The two countries have had a pretty bad relationship with each other... ...but supposedly, they've been trying really hard to make up recently. That's why they decided to hold this event.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If that's the case, then why the "versus"...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Also, both countries claim to own the real "Primidux Statue", a national treasure to both. They're planning to have them publicly evaluated today, to see which one's the real deal.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, need I remind you to take care and not succumb to your thieving desires?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, when it comes to treasure, I can't help myself. You know that!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Nngh... She had better be saying that in jest...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey! I can read your body language, you know! And you've got it all wrong! Look! I'm here to do some investigating! INVESTIGATING, I tell you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh, I know. And although we don't know if the Yatagarasu will really make an appearance... ...I suppose we should still spend some time examining this place.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's a very festive atmosphere in here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yup, super festive! I'm really happy for the Kingdom of Allebahst and the Republic of Babahl. It's great that they have re-established diplomatic relations! The newspapers say that it's almost like they're Cohdopia once again.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps we are bearing witness to a historic moment in time.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey! Look! They're selling some commemorative merchandise to celebrate this event! Founder's Cohdopia Biscuits. And over here, they're selling Royal Cohdopia Biscuits.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It would seem that they have yet to reconcile their competitive spirits.</line>
<line speaker="Guard">Is there something I can help you with?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I was wondering what is beyond these doors.</line>
<line speaker="Guard">It's the Allebahstian Embassy. Now, unless you have some business with the Embassy...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I suppose I can't really claim to have any business with the Embassy right now.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, you don't have to be so rude about it, Mr. Guard! Hrmph!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The national flag of the Kingdom of Allebahst is on display here. The crest on it features a flower.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Flowers and butterflies are kind of rare motifs for flags, don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, when they used to be Cohdopia, the government used to take pride in its land. The citizens also loved the rich, bountiful nature all around them, thus the design.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, if the Steel Samurai got popular enough, do you think they'd put him on their flag?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you in your right mind, Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... Or maybe the Jammin' Ninja would make a better candidate...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Heh, don't make me laugh, Kay. Only the Steel Samurai deserves such an honor.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Man">Ten more minutes... No, in five more minutes... But isn't it really bad for me to spend time doing this? It's no use! Would someone please just tell me what I should do!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You appear to be troubled by something. May I be of any assistance?</line>
<line speaker="Man">Leave me alone! I'm trying to figure out just the right time to talk to that girl over there! And if I mess up, it'll be because I'm talking to you right now!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Somehow, I get the feeling he's about to fall flat on his face.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, let's just do as he wishes and leave him alone.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Those are some nice flowers! I wonder who they're from? "Gatewater Imperial Hotel"? Where's this, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ah, it's an ultra-luxurious hotel that sponsors the Steel Samurai series. I've been there once to investigate a case.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh? So what kind of case was it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe it was related to the Nickel Samurai and the Jammin' Ninja...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, I remember reading about that! You must be the head of Steel Samurai affairs down at the Prosecutor's Office, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I should think that even you can figure that such an office does not exist, Kay.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Fan">You know, I've seen a lot of these shows in a bunch of other places... ...but today's show, it was like they went for a complete comedy, know what I mean?</line>
<line speaker="Friend">Yeah, And that last move, the Sushi Slice... I couldn't help but laugh!</line>
<line speaker="Fan">I know, right!? And that Pink Princess's movements were really stiff. In the middle of the show, I could swear that I heard her hip crack.</line>
<line speaker="Friend">Oh, I know! I totally thought that, too! The Pink Princess has a bad hip!? Seriously!? Just what they thinking, you know!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I suppose there is no graceful way to enter this conversation...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There are pamphlets about the two embassies here on this table.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... It still looks weird to me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The country split into two a few years back. And they've shared the building and its grounds 50-50 ever since.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh? I guess it's because they don't have the money to build two separate ones, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I should think that's not the reason why, Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Man">This is... the perfect angle!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">?</line>
<line speaker="Man">Go, my image! Travel across the wave world and into every TV set around the globe!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A more honest approach to appearing on TV might serve your ambitions better...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Reporter">And we're here, reporting live from the Theatrum Neutalis. As you can see, tonight's audience is full of enthusiasm! Let's see what this member of the audience has to say.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W-Well, I...</line>
<line speaker="Cameraman">OK, that was good. Let's do one more run-through!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Excuse me, but when you are ready to film for real, would you mind giving me a call...? <thought>I sense that she didn't hear a single world I just said.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Cameraman">OK, OK, that's good. Alright, now give me a dramatic "slam!" right there! Stop! Stoooop! Hey, do you mind!? Get out of the way, buddy. OK, once more! In 3, 2, 1, action!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, was that my fault just now?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, he's obviously working... I guess we should leave him alone.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a flat-panel, a tape deck, and a row of Steel Samurai videos on this table. I suppose it's so that visitors can watch an episode or two at their leisure.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I guess it really is just that popular, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, although I never thought I would see it reach this level of popularity...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder why they decided to call on the Steel Samurai for an event like this? I mean, it's like they intended to cut the two countries apart with the Samurai Sword instead!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Wouldn't that go against the whole point of this event...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It appears that the child is watching a video from the first season of the Steel Samurai.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Child">♪Go! Go! Keep on fighting, until your last breath!♪ ♪Go, my hero, the Steel Samurai!♪</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Completely absorbed in singing the theme song, I see... I'll let the child watch in peace.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These flowers were sent by Global Studios.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Global Studios?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's where they film the Steel Samurai television show. They have been producing hit after hit recently, so the studio is being remodeled.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! I read about that in the papers the other day! That mascot of theirs is also getting a face-lift, too, right? Umm... what's its name?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You mean Mrs. Monkey?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, I thought it was something like that! You really have a great memory!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hah! Never underestimate my powers of recollection.</line>
<line speaker="Cameraman">Where in tarnation are they!? Come on, big scoop! Hey, mister! Outta the way! Yeah, I'm talkin' to ya!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nngh... <thought>I seem to remember this woman from somewhere... ...yet my instincts are directing me not to engage in conversation with her. Perhaps it would be best if I left her alone.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The national flag of the Republic of Babahl is on display here. The crest on it features a butterfly.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's really rare to see a national flag featuring an animal on it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Not really. I can list at least a few off for you that do.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">OK, then are there any flags with really chic things on them?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"Chic" things? That's pretty vague, Kay... Although, by my definition, there aren't really any flags that feature a "chic" object.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww, that's too bad. Because if there was, I was thinking about stealing it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>And what exactly would you do with a stolen national flag, Kay...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Guard">Is there something I can help you with?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I was wondering what is beyond these doors.</line>
<line speaker="Guard">The Babahlese Embassy is just beyond these doors, sir. Do you have some business with the Embassy? Do you require immediate access?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ah, no, that's quite alright.</line>
<line speaker="Guard">Are you sure, sir? Anyone and everyone is always welcome in the Republic of Babahl!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, then! Since we're here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">An embassy isn't some sort of theme park, Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Tch! You're such a buzz kill!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose I'll just help myself to one of these...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm? What is all the hubbub?</thought> Ack!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, look! It's the Steel Samurai! And he's got his son, the Iron Infant, with him!!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">May I speak with you for a second? <thought>...It's... the Steel Samurai...</thought></line>
<line speaker="S.Samurai">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! What are you glaring at him for!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ahem, please excuse me. It's just that I've never seen a super-hero up close before.</line>
<line speaker="S.Samurai">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It looks like he's written something down for you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"To Edgeworth, From Steel Samurai Daddy: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo"</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow, an autograph! Pretty cool that you got one, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh...</line>
<line speaker="Guard">Mr. Steel Samurai! Ambassador Alba is waiting for you!</line>
<line speaker="Reporter">And now the Steel Samurai... ...will proceed to enter the Kingdom of Allebahst to shake the hand of the ambassador. The Steel Samurai isn't only here for the two countries tonight... ...but rather, can be thought of as a goodwill ambassador from our own country as well!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There he goes. Off to spread goodwill to the world.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He really does seem like a goodwill ambassador, doesn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Cameraman">OK! We're shooting the next segment now! Cue camera!</line>
<line speaker="Reporter">In just a few seconds, the Jammin' Ninja stage show is set to begin. After the show, the Jammin' Ninja will enter the Republic of Babahl. He is set to meet with the Ambassador of Babahl at that time.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">AHH! The Jammin' Ninja's show is about to start! We've gotta get back to our seats!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Regrettably... I don't have much of an interest in ninjas...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, this show will change your mind! Come on, we have to hurry! If we miss even a second of the Jammin' Ninja's awesome playing, I'll never forgive you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Nngh... I suppose you're not about to give me much of a choice here, are you, Kay?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ahhh! I could listen to that "A Ninja Marked for Death's Lullaby" song all day! His superb playing and that sad melody really brought a tear to my eye! And his heart-wrenching voice! Now THAT'S the Jammin' Ninja's greatest weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..................</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ahh! Those pieces of Jammin' Ninja merchandise over there! I've got to have them! I especially want the hair sticks they're selling exclusively at these shows. They're exactly like the ones the heroine, Princess Misola, wears in her hair!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Anyway!? ANYWAY!? Hold it right there, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You're thinking of going home, aren't you!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, it doesn't seem likely that the Yatagarasu will be making an appearance tonight. Most likely, it was simply a prank.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No way! I just know the Yatagarasu will show!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But I thought you said that the Yatagarasu doesn't send calling cards.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, I did, but...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I figured from the very beginning that this would wind up being a wild goose chase.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But that card she sent was a genuine fake calling card!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A genuine fake...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, how can I word this...? The Yatagarasu's mark that's on the calling card is exactly the same as my mark. Get it now?</line>
<line speaker="Officer">W-We've got a problem! Th-The Yatagarasu has been spotted in Allebahst!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Hah! So you finally decided to show yourself, you phony! Hey, what gives!?</line>
<line speaker="Guard">I'm sorry but I will need to search you before you may enter.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What the!? Hey! The Steel Samurai just waltzed straight on through without one! Now if you don't hurry up and let me through, my phony is going to escape!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, a country's embassy is considered to be a part of the country itself. If you don't go through the proper procedures to enter the country...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! I'm going to enter through Babahl and climb over the wall into Allebahst!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You would tell a prosecutor straight out that you intend to illegally enter another... Kay, are you listening to me!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Kay Faraday, and I'm coming through!</line>
<line speaker="Guard">Yes, and welcome!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Someone stop her! Anyone!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">*huff, huff, huff*... Kay... Where are you? Don't tell me you really did find some way over this fence... Ack!</line>
<line speaker="Guard">Fire! This is too big for us to handle! Looks like the Yatagarasu came to Babahl, too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! You had better be alright, wherever you are!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I told you! It wasn't me!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">..................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">*huff, huff, huff*... Kay! Are you alright!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Do I look alright to you!? Now, can you do something about this woman!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe! What is the meaning of this!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">*sigh* Well, sir... it's um, this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He's...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It wasn't me! He was already dead when I ran in here, hot on the heels of the fake Yatagarasu! Look, I only came in here because I saw a suspicious person at the open-air stage!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A suspicious person?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A long, black coat and a hood over their head -- I dare you to tell me that's not suspicious! When I saw that person, I immediately thought that they must be the fake Yatagarasu. So I chased after them into the Embassy, then into here, and then lost sight of them... But I just KNOW that person is the one who did it!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">What are you so worked up over? There is no reason for you to be this loud.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're Agent Lang's secretary... ...Shih-na, I believe your name is, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">..................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And if you are making an arrest... ...I assume you have evidence that it was Kay who committed the crime, is that also correct?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">..................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You refuse to answer!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I don't need to answer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">You are merely a prosecutor in this country, meaning you have no investigative authority.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">H-Hey, pal! Just what the heck does what you just said mean!? If it happened here, it's under Mr. Edgeworth's jurisdiction. The end. And seeing as how this building is sitting on our soil, we can investigate wherever we'd like!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Unfortunately, Detective, embassies are a different matter.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This office is considered to be a part of the Republic of Babahl. Which means that anything that happens in here... ...defaults to the control of the Babahlese government and Bahahlese law... ...giving them exclusive extraterritorial rights.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Extraterristrial rights? Sir, do you really believe that the truth is out there!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">*sigh* Basically, our country's laws do not apply inside the embassy of another country. That's what was agreed to by our respective governments. Our authority to investigate was effectively nullified the second we entered this place. Which means we can do little here in this situation...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">N-No way, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Please leave this matter in Interpol's hands and go home.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">N...Nnnnngh...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">M-Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">H-Hey, you're not...!? Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="???">In that case... allow me to join your investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">M-Ms. von Karma! Eeek!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Ambassador Palaeno, I truly appreciate you allowing me to join the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">It's really nothing. Manny was my secretariat, so of course I want to help you as much as I can. In fact, it's a blessing that Interpol agents were able to make it so quickly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Well, well. I never imagined that I'd meet you here of all places. This is an embassy, meaning that you have no authority to conduct...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">A-Already!? What is it!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Hm? And you are?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm Miles Edgeworth, public prosecutor. I ask that you please allow me to investigate this case as Ms. von Karma's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">A...Assistant?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles!? What the heck do you think you're...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please, I implore you, Ambassador Palaeno.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Very well. I'll be counting on the two of you, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Umm... What did you mean by you'll be Ms. von Karma's assistant...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't exactly have a choice, do I, Detective? If I don't become Franziska's assistant, I can't participate in this investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Hmph. There you go again, running at the mouth with that aloof expression on your face.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska, please...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I don't know what you're planning quite yet... ...but at least I do know one thing -- that you are now my subordinate. Just remember that my whip is always ready to wake you, should you have a brain lapse.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course. I'll keep that in mind.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...If you are done playing games...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right. let's begin the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By the way, Detective... I suppose it's a bit late to be asking, but why are you here?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, better late than never, I guess, sir. I was placed on guard duty for the Babahlese Embassy today!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And why are our police guarding an embassy?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, on account of the card they got from the Yatagarasu... ...they called us up and asked for our help, sir. Oh, and because we've been searching for the Yatagarasu these past seven years! It was a more or less mutually beneficial arrangement, if you ask me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Except for how mutally unbeneficial this has all turned out to be, I suppose. It looks like you failed to competently perform your guard duty yet again.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ack...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Look forward to your next salary negotiation... although, it's out of my hands.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">But sir! If it gets cut any more, I won't be able to buy even packet noodles anymore...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The design on the knife's handle... ...it greatly resembles the special Babahlese species of butterfly.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It does, doesn't it? Plus, it says right here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"This knife is property of the Republic of Babahl." Perhaps this means that the knife used in the crime was foudn right in this room...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"To steal your dirtiest secret"... Is it possible that the "dirty secret" the Yatagarasu was out to steal is in this very room?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">"Dirty secret"?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska, you're in pursuit of some "dirty" underhanded dealings yourself, are you not? Something tells me that this is no coincidence.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">In that case then, the person I'm looking for is here in the Babahlese Embassy, huh? The head of the smuggling operation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I think I just might need to ask Franziska about her smuggling case in more depth.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy. Furthermore, we found it in the victim, Mr. Coachen's pocket. Which leads me to think that perhaps it is the key to the personal safe in this office.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Good thinking, sir! Let's go try it out!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It appears I was correct. <thought>The key that was left to us in the victim's pocket... It literally turned out to be the key to the next piece of the truth!</thought> Hmm... What do we have here?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey! There's nothing inside! D-Do you think the Yatagarasu made off with everything, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, Detective, I believe all we need is a closer look.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">While you were on guard duty, did you notice anything unusual?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, I was on watch inside the Embassy... ...but unfortunately, I didn't run into the Yatagarasu, sir. But I did talk to an officer who was on duty near the border between the two Embassies... ...who told me that not a single person crossed the boundary during the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">The investigations into the fire and the Yatagarasu are a mess thanks to both events! I'm so confused, sir! Should I be putting the fire out or investigating!? What do you think, sir!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Aren't you old enough to solve your own problems yet, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd like an update on how the investigation is going.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oh, yeah... Well... it's going, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In other words... ...no one has any idea of what happened here, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">To put it simply... yeah, you got it, sir. But! We do know that something happened in this room, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Any moron with a pair of eyes can see what happened, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Aww... W-Well, anyway! Let's investigate every single nook and cranny in this room, sir! We have to get serious, or Kay will end up getting arrested as the killer!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I am already well aware of that.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>In order to find out what really happened here in this room... ...we will need to gather whatever information we can. It's time to take a good look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, it's your Prosecutor's Badge! This thing's really important, right? So what would happen if you lost it, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why are you asking me such an ominous question?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, because I've lost my police badge before, sir! I just wanted to tell you to be careful, sir! Because writing the explanation section on those requisition forms is really annoying!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I believe SOMEONE needs to listen to his own advice a bit more often...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hmm... So this is the Yatagarasu's Key, huh? That's a really nifty trick they built into it. I can't stop playing with it! This is great! It's like one of those transforming toys, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">E-Evidence is not meant to entertain, Detective!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What do you notice about this piece of evidence, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Umm... Well, uh... I don't really sense anything special about it... But the embassy is a different story!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........I see.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...I'm not really sensing anything special from you either, sir...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, I'm sensing a special look at your monthly salary, Detective!</line>
<line speaker="Officer">Sorry, but Interpol is still conducting its investigation beyond this point.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm a subordinate of Ms. von Karma. Is there some reason why I'm being denied access?</line>
<line speaker="Officer">My superior clearly stated, "Don't you dare let anyone near the site, you got it!?" If I let you examine the site, my superior would get really angry at me!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">You know, Mr. Edgeworth... I feel really bad for the guy, so why don't we do as he says?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... I suppose we might as well.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">That's some fireplace! You know, it really gives this place a mansion-like quality, don't you think, sir!? Ooh! If these are a staple in every Babahlese house... ...then I bet Santa Claus pays them a visit, too.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Just how old are you again, Detective...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A small, personal safe...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">This was Mr. Coachen's office. So perhaps he stored his most important documents in here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ah, of course it's locked. It appears we won't be able to open it without the key <thought>Locked safe - The secretariat's office safe. It can't be opened without the key.</thought>.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, there is a hole here, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's a little too oddly shaped for a latch hole...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wow, that's a funny shape for a latch hole, huh? It's shaped kinda... like a star, don't you think, sir!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective, I would hardly call that shape a star... <thought>There must be some reason for this hole...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, there's gotta be some reason why this hole's shaped so weirdly, you know!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Am I over thinking this? No, I don't think so...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hmm, maybe I'm over thinking things? Nah, there's no way I could ever do that, ho ho!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe, could you please be quiet for a second? You're frightening me.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It looks like such a serious safe, but there's not a scrap of paper inside... Which reminds me, the safe in your office is just as empty, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's merely a coincidence that both safes are empty, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, make that a triple coincidence because my piggy bank at home is empty, too...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't think there's anything coincidental about that, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What is this here?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It looks like the ripped corner of a piece of paper, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, I don't think it's ripped; it seems more, to me, like it's stuck in the safe.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, you're right! It won't budge an inch, not even when I tug on it! But I don't think I've ever seen paper stuck on the inside of a safe before...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective, I think you have it backwards. It's not the paper that's strange... It's the safe.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is nothing in the safe.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Well, yeah, there's nothing in the safe... but what's that got to do with anything?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Why is the safe here in the first place?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Umm... To keep really important things safe, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, precisely. However, there is nothing inside this safe... ...which points us to a clear contradiction of facts!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">........But remember when we checked out your safe that time, and you answered...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right now? Nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...when I asked you what was inside? Wouldn't that count as a contradiction, too, then?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh! <thought>I suppose there are times when there just isn't anything that needs to be safeguarded. Alright, time to recollect my thoughts...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... It is just as it appears to be. There is a crack in the safe, from where the lodged piece of paper is protruding!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah, that's exactly what it looks like, alright.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nngh...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">We already know, so there's no reason for you to state the obvious so confidently, Miles.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">N...Nngh...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, I feel like I'm step closer to understanding what it's like to be Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Drat... It appears the only thing I managed to do here is waste time.</thought> Th-That wasn't what I had meant to say! The paper is sticking out, and that in itself is an important fact. So...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow. Furthermore, with the unnatural way the paper is stuck at the back of the safe... ...I'd say that there is an extra bit of space behind the back wall of this safe! In other words, this safe has a second compartment.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wh-Whaaaaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner. However, if what you say is correct and there is a second compartment... ...how do we go about opening the door to it then? As you can see, there is no other lock or keyhole in sight.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Actually, there is one more spot of interest to me on this safe.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, and I believe that spot is the keyhole to our mystery second lock!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The safe and its locks... Alright then, since you are so sure of yourself, show me how you deduced your answer!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This piece of evidence is the key to the safe!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I'm not entirely convinced it is... ...but I'm willing to entertain any explanation you may have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ack!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Don't worry, sir! I'm sure you're right in what you said! Although... I'm not quite sure how that piece of evidence is related to the safe either...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arrngh... <thought>It's bad enough for Franziska to doubt me, but Detective Gumshoe as well!? I must remain calm, and examine this safe once more for a clue on how to open it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Doesn't the shape of this keyhole remind you of something, Franziska?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The shape? It does look very familiar... However, I believe it's simply a latch hole for the safe's lock mechanism. It's just for keeping the door shut, nothing more.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that so? The person who used this safe... ...Mr. Coachen, made sure this safe had two compartments, in order to hide something. Do you honestly think someone like that would allow the keyhole to the hidden half... ...to look so obviously like a keyhole that even the average person could figure it out?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">! ...You can't be serious...! Are you saying that this hole is the keyhole to the hidden compartment of this safe?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's precisely what I'm saying.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And I will prove to you right now... ...that the Yatagarasu's Key is the key that will open it!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The Yatagarasu's Key!? Miles Edgeworth! This had better be a very bad joke!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sorry, but this is no joke. The Yatagarasu's Key... ...is the very key that will open the second compartment of this safe.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">We know that this key opens the first compartment of the safe. But the keyhole you're talking about... ...is of an entirely different shape than that of the key!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We discovered this trick seven years ago, and with it, we were able to corner Ms. Yew. But who would've thought that I'd see this key again after all this time...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's go over this again, shall we? The Yatagarasu's Key... ...was originally made to open Mr. Coachen's safe in the Cohdopian Embassy. We confirmed that as fact by opening the door to his safe with it. Now, let's take a look at the back end of the key. Looking, at the knife portion head on, what do you see?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What are you talking... Aaah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears that you've come to understand what I'm talking about. When viewed head-on, the knife's blade is the exact same shape as the keyhole! The real function of the knife portion is to act as the key to the hidden portion of the safe.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">B-But that's... preposterous!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Because it looks like a knife and was used like one to kill Mr. Faraday seven years ago... ...we fell under the misconception that it was always meant to be a knife. But for both the safe and its key to conceal such clever tricks... ...whatever is hidden inside the secret section must be of incredible importance.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">.........Then, it's even possible that what I've been searching for is inside! Scruffy! Hurry up and open that safe!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Eeeek! Y-Yes, sir! Opening it now, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These items... They're...!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It's a bunch of funny-shaped things. I guess they're pieces of art, huh, siiiiir!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You're in the way! Now, move, Scruffy!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I don't think I was in the way... *sniffle*</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">These pieces of art...! They're identical to ones that have been stolen from various countries around the world!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I figured as much... These are the treasures this section of the safe was to hide from view! Hmm... I believe a more thorough examination is required.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears that we've found the key that the Yatagarasu... ...no, Ms. Yew stole seven years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Since it was originally from this embassy, maybe she came back to return it...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't think she's the type to be so kind as to do such a thing, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Umm... OK, then what do you think, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Calisto Yew... For what reason did she steal the key...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These are pieces of stolen art from around the world...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I wonder how much they're worth? Especially this one... Eeeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Scruffy! Don't touch those valuable pieces of art with your filthy hands! Why, do you have any idea what would happen to you if one of them were to break?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is it just me, or did she hit one of the pieces of art just now...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the document that we thought was stuck earlier. I wonder what it's about?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Beats me, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why don't we take a look at it first before we give up, Detective? Mr. Coachen's name is written here on the last page. <thought>I wonder what the significance of this document is?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The existence of this document in itself is quite important, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Yes, it proves that Manny Coachen was the ringleader of the smuggling operation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose it does. <thought>It really does look that way, however... ...I don't believe this shows us all that he was up to. And in order to find the truth behind his dealings, we'll need to continue investigating.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">To build this sort of trick into one's safe is really something...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah, it's neat how this safe has two compartments, but what's really impressive... ...is that at the other end of the key was another key! I totally hadn't noticed!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wonder if Mr. Coachen was just paranoid or if he had secrets of that great a value.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Speaking of paranoid, I once sharpened both ends of my pencil. But then, when I went to erase something, I got all paranoid that I was gonna stab myself.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please refrain from dispensing your special brand of unrelated stories while on duty.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe this piece of evidence is somehow related.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oh, I see! That's just like you, sir, to figure these things out! ...But I have no idea what that connection is, so could you explain it to me, please!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well. .............................. <thought>...I'm not sure that I can explain it... I guess it's not related after all.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Come on, sir! Hurry up and explain it to me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will. Eventually. Let's save it for another time when I have the proper time to explain it to you. <thought>I suppose I should carefully examine everything one more time...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Take a good look at these documents, Franziska.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It says that there are three pages in total, and yet, there are only two here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Correct. Now take a look at the smuggling activity document in your possession. Tell me, is it not possible that your page was taken from this set of three?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Well, well... It certainly looks that way.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By putting our multi-part puzzle together, we seem to have arrived at an answer. And it seems that you have now found what you were looking for.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Yes, and with this, it has become crystal clear... ...that Mr. Coachen himself was responsible for the mass smuggling of Babahlese ink!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Babahlese ink?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Babahlese ink is a special product of the Republic of Babahl. However, due to a special reason, only a limited volume is ever exported.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And that reason is...?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That's classified. It's on a need to know basis, and you don't need to know. In any case, it seems that the head of the smuggling ring was our victim, Mr. Manny Coachen.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">His base was in an embassy, thus, it was hard for both our country and his to interfere. Making it the deal conditions under which to run a smuggling operation.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Argh... but it's so frustrating. I lost the person I was to rain judgement down upon with my Whip of Justice.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, even if he is dead, we still have a responsibility to look into his misdeeds.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You expect me to whip a dead man? ...Well, I'm not interested.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska... You must know... ...that Manny Coachen was the suspect in the KG-8 Incident...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Of course I know! On top of being the head of the smuggling ring... ...there is the matter of what really happened in that case that needs to be resolved.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So our victim... was the secretariat of this embassy, I take it.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Manny Coachen. I heard that he was an admirable person... very admirable.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The cause of death is a stab to the base of his neck... He was lax in watching his back.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">We were fortunate that the fire missed our victim's body for the most part. If the fire had burned a bit longer it would've made identifying him a hassle.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death in the middle of a raging fire...? What in the world happened inside this room?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm? This man... Where do I know him from...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... There appears to be something in this pocket.&#160;! This key! It can't be...! Isn't this the Yatagarasu's Key that was stolen seven years ago!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What!? But that's...!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh? Seven years ag...oooh! You mean that case where I was framed, sir!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, it's the piece of evidence that stole the life of Kay's father seven years ago... ...which was then stolen by Calisto Yew.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wh-What!? Mr. Faraday was killed with this key, sir!? I thought he was killed with a knife... Eeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Scruffy! At the very least, try to remember the details of crimes you were a suspect in!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska, as you will recall... ...Detective Gumshoe was not present when Ms. Yew made her escape. Plus, even among law enforcement, only a few knew of this key's existence. I doubt that a new rookie at the time would've been made privy to such knowledge.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ooonnngh... I feel like the victim right now, all trampled on, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... I suppose I'll just have to fill you in now. The secret to this key is...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's not that far-fetched to think that the end of this key was meant to be a butterfly. The key maker must've been a true patriot to have fashioned this after the national symbol.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ohoooo! Wow, that's amazing, sir! It's like some kind of magic trick!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I knew it. This is the same exact piece of evidence that Ms. Yew took with her... I remember this beautiful pattern in the blade.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I remember this as well. It's a vine motif, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, it looks like two interwoven vines, crisscrossing down the blade.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Vines, sirs? I think it looks like a bunch of stars, if you ask me. It's one of those six-sided stars, just like the police mark on our IDs!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I... really don't think you can call these stars. <thought>...To say that the detective's art sense is underdeveloped would be an understatement.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The real question is why was the Babahlese Embassy's secretariat holding this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">While we don't kow how Mr. Coachen came to possess this key... ...we do know that this was stolen by the Yatagarasu from the Cohdopian Embassy.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That's right. Mr. Faraday had written that fact down in his organizer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe this means that further research is required into the country of Cohdopia.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Why don't you ask Ambassador Palaeno about what he knows? Supposedly, he was a candidate to be the next Cohdopian ambassador once long ago. He should be able to answer any specific questions you may have.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the Yatagarasu's Key... I wonder how it managed to return here?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">So this key was stolen by Calisto Yew seven years ago, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, although originally, it was stolen from this very building.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, then, maybe Ms. Yew just decided to bring it back.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I can't dismiss that possibility, however... <thought>...it doesn't fit her modus operandi, given all of her other actions.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's a knife wound.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It's obvious what he was killed with, but I wonder if it's consistent with the wound?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is this knife the murder weapon...!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Some preliminary testing has been conducted. According to the results, the blood on that matches the victim's blood. The blade's shape was also found to be consistent with the stab wound.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose this means that we now know that the crime was committed with this knife.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">This knife's got some really fancy ornamentation going on, huh, sir? This thing practically screams "ARTSY!" at me, too! Although, it's also covered in blood, just like the last thing that I said was artsy...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Hmm, but the handle is pristine, there's not a single drop of blood on it. Speaking of the handle... I believe it has a butterfly motif <thought>Motif on knife handle - A butterfly-shaped guard adorns the handle of the murder weapon.</thought>. It's very beautiful.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death in the middle of a raging fire...? What in the world happened inside this room?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, are you alright?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You believe me, don't you, Mr. Edgeworth? You don't think I did it, alright!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, of course I don't. And I promise to prove that it wasn't you.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">That's enough chit-chat. You can investigate all you like, but it's only a matter of time before we take her in. It would be wise of you to give up while you can.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, I don't think so. Kay isn't lying, and my investigation will prove that to be true.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Go ahead and try then, if you're that confident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can't allow this to continue on this way. I must prove her innocence post haste!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Heeeey! It's another butterfly!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe it is the symbol of the Republic of Babahl <thought>Buttlerfly of Babahl - National symbol that adorns the national flag. Allebahst's flower is its counterpart.</thought>. A drawing this big on the wall of an embassy... It definitely conveys a sense of overwhelming patriotism.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, I've got a lot of patriotism, too, sir! The reason I became a cop in the first place was because I wanted to protect our country!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You may want to, Detective, however, I have yet to see the fruits of your desire.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Y-You don't have to be so blunt about it, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This ceiling fan must've fallen from the ceiling.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">A ceiling fan? What does one of those do?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly what it sounds like it does; it's a fan that is installed on one's ceiling.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, if I had one of those in my room, I bet I'd go dizzy from staring at it as I slept.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe. In the real world, we close our eyes when we sleep.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Because this is a national treasure, can I ask that you please not touch it? I'm afraid the only ones allowed to touch it are myself and the secretarist.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But there is a possibility that it is related to the murder, wouldn't you agree?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Why don't we give up for now? We can force them to let us investigate it later when we find some solid proof!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I suppose I don't have a choice here. <thought>This must be one of the Primidux Statues Kay was talking about earlier. ............ Is it just me or does this man look just like the Steel Samurai? They could be twins.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth! There's still something on this display rack, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Knives, huh... Although, the blades are all that remain of them, unfortunately.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I guess the handles all got burnt off by the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Ah... So even the knives fell victim to the fire...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, are these knives yours?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Why yes, they are. They are a special set of ornamental knives featuring the national symbol of Babahl. These butterfly-themed knives, along with Allebahst's own set of knives... ...are comprised of three knives each. But... But I can't believe the Babahlese ones have been reduced to this state...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... <thought>Ornamental knives, huh? ...Hm? There's a small release on the tang of this blade.</thought> Ambassador Palaeno, what is this notch here for...?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, that! It's a feature of these knives wherein you can freely exchange the handles on them. So that we can change how they look to fit the situation, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. So these knives were constructed so that the handles could be easily removed.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Let me tell you something. You are currently my subordinate. And if you wish to convince everyone else of that, you will speak to me with respect!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What's with the giddy glint in her eyes?</thought> I don't think that will really be necessary, Franziska.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Oh, really? Well, it doesn't matter. It doesn't change the fact that you are still under me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I thought Franziska was flying around the world in pursuit of the smuggling case. So then, why is she here at this embassy (Franziska's return - Why is she here when she is supposed to be overseas in pursuit of a smuggling ring?</thought>...?)</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I was investigating at the Allebahstian Embassy when I got wind of this mess.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ah, that's right. The Yatagarasu was due to appear at that embassy as well.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Yes, but the difference is that we didn't have a fire over there. Although, there was an incident at the Allebahstian Embassy as well... But I left Agent Lang in charge of that case and came over to the Babahlese Embassy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ah... So Agent Lang is here as well, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I see you've met. Well, he's in the Allebahstian Embassy acting as body guard for Ambassador Alba. ...However, he seems to have a different reason for being there.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">So the suspect in the murder that occurred in this office is that little girl, I see. Is she, perhaps, trying to be the Yatagarasu?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">K-Kay would never harm a soul, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You remember, do you not? About the case we investigated together seven years ago? That girl is the daughter of the victim in that case, Mr. Faraday.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">! So she's that feisty little girl...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay has been on the trail of the Yatagarasu, which is how she ended up here... ...looking for the one who took her father's life.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...I see.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Kay's trying so hard, but you know what!? The Yatagarasu just keeps on tricking us all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm...? How so?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, "I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret <thought>Stealing of secret - The card warned that the Yatagarasu will steal the embassy's "dirtiest secret."</thought>"... ...but all we've had is an arson and a murder! The lab boys are going in circles! You know what this is, sirs!? It's a breach of contract, and it's going on the rap sheet!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">If you ask me, I'm perfectly fine with the fact that nothing was stolen tonight.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I do wonder, though, if Calisto Yew really is the Yatagarasu...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska, when we last talked, you said that you were on the trail of a smuggling ring. I suppose the reason you are here right now is related to that?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Yes. After analyzing the intel we've gathered from various countries... ...this embassy... rose to the top of our list of sites to investigate. And this is what tipped us off.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This accounting document...?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It's only one page of the whole thing, so we're not sure about all the details... ...however, it's enough for us to grab onto the tail of the beast. For you see... this type of paper was made only in the Kingdom of Cohdopia. Which means that somewhere in the countries of Allebahst and Babahl is the head! The one pulling the strings behind the entire smuggling ring!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's Franziska for you... She's amazing -- pursuing this case with all she has.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What about your Prosecutor's Badge? I have one, too, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ah, yes... So you do. But seeing as I'm not currently a proper prosecutor, I thought I'd give presenting it a try.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">............ Is that any way for you to act towards your superior!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As if threatening a whipping is the proper way of lecturing someone!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Would you mind not pointing that in my direction? It's dangerous. And anyway, why are you showing it to me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have no particular reason...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">!!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gnnrk!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">If you have no reason! Don't you bring that dangerous object near me! Do you understand!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! <thought>I-Is she really that oblivious to the irony in that statement? She lets looses that dangerous whip of hers for no reason all the time!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It appears that he died of a stab wound. Arngh!! Whoever did this had a lot of nerve! I just can't fathom what could've led the killer to turn a knife against a man!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And I just can't fathom what the prosecutor lashing out with her whip is thinking...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">We were able to finally obtain this proof of the smuggling operation through Interpol. So remember to take extra care when handling it... my subordinate.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">*sigh*... <thought>She's enjoying the power trip of calling me her subordinate just a taaaad too much...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. von Karma, what do you think of this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Hmph, well, since you asked so nicely as my subordinate, I'll answer you. However, as your superior, I also must make sure that my subordinates grow on the job. Therefore, please gather your own thoughts together first, and then try presenting again.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A simple, "I don't have any thoughts about that" would be sufficed...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">I can't believe that Manny fell among thieves tonight... Without him, I have no idea what my schedule for tonight is.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, I believe your schedule tonight will consist of... ...listening to reports from the police. That and only that. I ask you to cooperate not only for your own sake, but for Mr. Coachen's as well.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">...You're a rather strong man, aren't you? How fascinating! Here, I know it isn't much, but I'd like you to have these.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sorry, but it would be against my principles to accept a bribe.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, no, no. These are simply coupons we distribute to promote Babahl. Remember, we offer a large number of discounts and offers when you visit lovely Babahl!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Now I remember. The Republic of Babahl is known for its feverish tourism industry...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I was wondering if you might tell me a bit about the deceased, Manny Coachen.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">He was my secretary, and the embassy secretariat, charged with running the whole place. He was an admirable man. His death is a great loss to our country. He was in charge of everything, accounting, printing, taking care of our national treasures...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sorry, but did you say "printing"?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Our country's primary source of revenue is our tourism industry. So, in order for us to print the necessary pamphlets, flyers, coupons, etcetera... ...we have a printing press here at our embassy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. Please excuse my forwardness, however... ...I feel I should mention that I have the distinct impression that I've met him before.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">! Oh, yes... Since you are of the legal profession, I suppose you just might have. After all, Manny was involved in the KG-8 Incident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th-The KG-8 Incident!?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">The defendant who was found innocent in that case was Manny.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So your Mr. Coachen is the same man as the one in that case...</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">It's been 10 years. Manny recovered personally from that case, and dove enthusiastically into this job. He was the one who planned this event, and was to oversee this embassy's renovations. It really is a shame. He had such a bright future ahead of him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What exactly did you mean earlier by "renovations"?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">We can't have tourists and visitors to our embassy think we're a poor nation, can we? So renovating the embassy is something of an investment. We may have a rather paltry budget, but we're trying our best to make due. However... ...I guess the only person who could've helped us do our best is now no longer with us.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, I was wondering if I may ask you about Cohdopia.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Cohdopia? Alright. What would you like to talk about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">First... I'd like to ask you about this key.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Hm? What about this key?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I found it sticking out of Mr. Coachen's pocket. I believe it originally belonged to this embassy. Is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Hmm... Upon closer inspection, it seems that this key is shaped like a butterfly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's not all about this key. It's also capable of changing into a knife.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh! How fascinating!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is it possible that the ambassador didn't know about the existence of this key...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">...Hm? In its knife form, there is a flower mark at the base of the blade. Hmm... I guess this knife might be from when we used to be a part of Cohdopia.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And how did you come to that conclusion?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">It has both of Cohdopia's national symbols, the butterfly and the flower. I suppose Manny used this key here at the embassy <thought>Key used at Embassy - This key was stolen from the Cohdopian Embassy 7 years ago by the Yatagarasu.</thought> back when we were still Cohdopia.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Ambassador Palaeno, this key was stolen from the Cohdopian Embassy seven years ago... ...by Calisto Yew, otherwise known as the Great Thief Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">! O-Oh, really?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You were not aware that Ms. Yew had broken into this embassy at that time?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">I'm sorry I can't be of much help. I'm not very familiar with the details, you see. I only became the ambassador after Babahl became its own independent nation. But if Manny were still alive, he would probably know about what happened back then...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Mr. Coachen and Ms. Yew knew each other seven years ago... But that doesn't explain why I foind the Yatagarasu's Key here in the present.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, is that a Prosecutor's Badge? It has a very cool design! Aha! I know! We should start selling items like this as souvenirs in Babahl! The tourists will absolutely go nuts over them!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Please don't compare a proud symbol of my profession to a cheap souvenir...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, isn't that about our great embassy? Ah... How do you like our pamphlets?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I feel indifferent about them, to be honest. I'm just using this as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, that's too bad... In that case, I guess we'll just have to try harder to make more charming ones!&#160;! I-I just had a flash of inspiration! We should make all of our pamphlets into coupon books!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">............ <thought>His expectations of what a coupon can do is just a tad hyper-inflated.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, dear... If people were to find out that a murder occurred at our embassy... ...the number of tourists would plummet, as would our revenues! It'd be disaster! What are we going to do...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He really does seem worried. Perhaps I should refrain from bringing this up...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">This statue resembles that hero, the Steel Samurai, don't you think? I was thinking, what would you say to changing its name to the "Steel Samurai Statue"? It just might attract a few more tourists to our country if I did, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I'm not sure what to think... <thought>I thought that thing was a national treasure...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, I was wondering if you might have some thoughts on this.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">I think that you would know more about the case than I. So let me make it up to you for not knowing anything about that with these coupons!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Thank you, however, I feel I must decline.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These shelves are lined with American souvenirs and memorabilia.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It's really strange isn't it? I mean, I thought this was the Babahlese Embassy! So, umm, why are there so many American souvenirs, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps the Babahlese are studying American culture and our tourism industry...? If they have plans to make the Babahlese tourism industry truly flourish... ...then they would need to observe and study other countries' methods, I suppose.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Speaking of tourism, I got these from the blond guy earlier, sir. He said that if I bring these with me to Babahl, I can trade them in for a few buffets!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? So, how do you expect to travel to Babahl?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, the whole world is connected by the oceans, sir! And for an all-you-can-eat buffet, I'd swim all the way to Babahl if I have to!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Can a few simple coupons really motivate people to do such fantastic things?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There are still some burnt objects scattered on the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, burnt things get burnt and then they become burnt things, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, because there is no way to prove that the burnt thing started out as a burnt thing.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Was it a burnt thing, or was it not? I have no idea what's what anymore, sir...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I suppose it's a bit hard for someone with a burnt-out light bulb to comprehend.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It looks like this was once a grand grandfather clock, but it has fallen victim to the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! Is it OK for me to talk about the clocks in my house, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If they're unrelated to the case, I hope that you will refrain from sharing, but...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, there's this one clock that I made by myself, but the timer on it manages to auto...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's quite enough, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a vine motif to the ornamentation on this table. Even if Detective Gumshoe claims to see a star motif in it. Between the blade and handle, there is a flower, and the key itself is a butterfly. This key was stolen by the Yatagarasu seven years ago from the Cohdopian Embassy... ...which suggests that this was made while Cohdopia still existed as a country.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So this is what took Mr. Coachen's life. Some of his blood is still on the blade.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wow, I've been a detective for 7 years already? I've seen a lot of weapons in my days... ...but knives that were used to kill are always the hardest for me to bear.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, unlike guns, this is one weapon where you're likely to find the victim's blood on it.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah, just like how this one is practically drenched in it, huh, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Despite that, it looks like the blood managed to miss the handle somehow.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a lot of skilled detailing on this handle. I believe this is a butterfly.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">This is one amazing ornamental knife. And I'm really glad that this beautiful butterfly wasn't ruined by blood.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is not even a drop of blood on it. It really is quite exquisite. So much so that even you can understand its beauty, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, why do you always have to look down on my tastes, sir!? I know what I like, and this is really well-crafted!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why do I look down on his tastes...? Because, my dear Detective, I'm afraid your tastes are usually quite questionable...</thought>&#160;! This knife... It would appear that the handle is removable.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I guess so people can change them whenever they feel like it. Sounds like fun, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't think people would remove the handle just for fun, Detective...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Are you done investigating?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..................</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">You realize now, don't you? That this girl is the only one it could be. Now come along quietly, Yatagarasu... Kay Faraday. You are under arrest for the murder of Manny Coachen.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">M...Mr. Edgeworth! Please, you have to believe me! I didn't do it! I chased the fake Yatagarasu in here... and he... he was already...</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd like to help you reduce the number of mistaken arrests Interpol makes.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...What is that supposed to mean?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe I told you that Kay Faraday is not the culprit of this crime.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Very well. I suppose I have no choice. I'll show you just how foolish your claims are!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your reason for suspecting Kay is because you think she is the Yatagarasu?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Exactly. But it isn't just me. She calls herself the Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Argh! Look, how many times do I have to tell you!? I was only out to capture the fake Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Imposter or not... it matters not. A Yatagarasu is a Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well. Then I shall prove that Kay is not the Yatagarasu who killed Mr. Manny Coachen!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Go ahead and try. Show me what the prosecutors of this country are made of.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They may have confirmed it, but are you telling me that no one could catch the thief? If so, you're basically admitting that the Yatagarasu that committed murder eluded us!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">......... Of course, I chased after the Yatagarasu that entered the Babahlese Embassy right away. And that is also why I'm making this arrest right now. Because at the end of my long chase... there was only this girl.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnnghoooh!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">In any case, this is what I believe happened tonight.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Utilizing the confusion cause by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The confusion caused by the fire...? Are you saying... that the Yatagarasu was not the arsonist who started the fire?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">A suspicious person in a long coat was spotted in the area. Officers in the area claim to have seen that person start the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... It sounds like we have a phantom in our midst.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Umm... Yeah...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>In a way... he could be considered a phantom, with the way he randomly appears.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Just because she calls herself that, it doesn't prove that she is a killer.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">No, but it does give her a motive. The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, "I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret." Furthermore, there are documents pertaining to some smuggling activity in this room. She obviously wanted to steal them... ...so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see... <thought>Her logic is very sound. I expected nothing less of Agent Lang's secretary. However, that statement just now didn't sound right. It might just be the opening I need.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key."</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you're claiming that Kay knew that a foreign country's embassy had such documents?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">As stated in the calling card, the Yatagarasu was out to steal a "dirty secret"... ...which means that the goal tonight was to steal those smuggling activity documents.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You have it all wrong! It was the fake that sent that card!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Your words are meaningless. If you are truly innocent, then let's see some proof.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm... Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I leave it to you to handle this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I'd rather you did. <thought>The Yatagarasu's goal, huh...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">You can claim she's innocent, but you can't change the facts I've already outlined.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I really don't think that being the first to discover the body makes her the killer by default.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">No, but if you saw the self-purported Yatagarasu standing in front of a body... ...wouldn't you get a little suspicious yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gnnrk! Even so... I'll still listen to what that person had to say before I passed judgement!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Hah, are you talking about yourself and those times when you were under suspicion?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think the pain of being falsely accused is something you really should experience.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I, personally, know that feeling really well, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And given my situation, I now know exactly what it's like, too!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I'm fine with never experiencing it, ever.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Are you done with your little group conference?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So Agent Shih-na suspects Kay of murder simply because Kay is the Yatagarasu. But if I can prove that the Yatagarasu's goal is not related to murder... ...then I may be able to begin to reason with her!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Shih-na. I regret to inform you, but there is a flaw in your logic.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even if you claim that she is the killer, and the Yatagarasu... ...I am certain that securing the smuggling documents is not the motive behind the murder! The key to the safe in this room was found on Mr. Coachen's body. Furthermore, the Yatagarasu would not be so stupid as to leave without the documents.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By the simple fact that the documents were still in the safe when we looked... ...it's obvious that the killer's target was not the safe at all!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Then perhaps she didn't know that Mr. Coachen had the key on him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If that's the case, then why would she have needed to kill him? Because I can think of no reason for her to kill him if she had not known that fact!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Need, reason... All of this is simply our conjecturing after the fact. It's entirely possible that she accidentally killed him when she was sneaking him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Perhaps she didn't notice the safe's second compartment before returning the key.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">But the fact still remains... that Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But you have no definitive proof that it was Kay who committed the act!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Actually, I do. I saw her holding the knife she used on the victim with my own eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-What...!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Allow me to tell you a bit more about the evidence that will put her away behind bars.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnnnnrrrrrgh... Th-That is your definitive evidence...!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">You see now that she is definitely the killer, right?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No! Mr. Edgeworth, you've gotta believe me! I saw a suspicious person in a long black coat outside the Embassy, I swear!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And you came in here because you were chasing this suspicious person?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right. I ran into this office only because I was chasing after that person... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the lights, but then...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="???">...Who's there!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">This is...</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I came to this room upon hearing the girl's scream. And when I saw her holding the knife, I immediately restrained her.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So the object Kay felt by her feet on the floor was the murder weapon...!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I had the knife analyzed right away, but we failed to find anyone prints on it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But the suspicious person in the black coat who came into this room before me...!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">You continue to insist there was such a person, but if there was, where did they go?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That... I don't know. But I know they came in here!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">That sounds like the desperate excuses of a suspected killer, not a trustworthy testimony. You understand, don't you? We can't trust this girl's words, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gnnrk! <thought>She has a point. Even if Kay's words are the truth... ...I must show that they are with some solid evidence!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... I really didn't...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! Kay... Don't worry. If you didn't do it, then there must exist a way for me to prove that.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Still not giving up, I see. In that case, try to counter my argument, if you can.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't worry, I can and I will!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Does this mean that you already have the results back?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">We have confirmed that the shape of the Babahlese knife's blade matches the wound. Please don't confuse the efficiency of Interpol's forensics teams with your own.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I won't if you don't underestimate our police force. And so we're clear, I'd hardly say your logic is sound, which you will see in a bit.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">If you can prove me wrong... please, by all means go ahead.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That has been my intention all along. Now, let us return to your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer is holding.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You mean to say that you saw Kay holding the murder weapon with your own eyes?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I was also on the search for the Yatagarasu. When I heard that girl's scream coming from this room, I rushed over straight way. When I arrived, I saw that girl standing there motionless with the knife in her hands.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But I already told you! I only came in here because I was also after the Yatagarasu! The suspicious person I saw came into this room! But when I entered, it was pitch dark. I felt something by my foot on the floor, so I turned on the lights, and then...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...You found out that it was the murder weapon at your feet.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">How many times do I have to tell you? We can't trust the words of a suspect.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The only thing you'll accept is evidence, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">That's the only acceptable way to counter an agent of Interpol on the scene of a crime.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... Do you have some kind of evidence that can prove me innocent...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think I do, because there is one piece of evidence I find to be a bit... interesting. <thought>I think I need to carefully examine that piece of evidence again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I ask that you please refrain from speculation!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">It's a sound hypothesis derived from the evidence. ...There's no room for debate.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth, know that an ungraceful loss will not be tolerated, my subordinate. Now, rebut her hypothesis with factual logic. Otherwise, what was your investigation for?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, you are correct. Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Heh... Helping a subordinate out with advice is the job of any good superior.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She seems to be rather enjoying herself. But she is correct, none the less.</thought> Agent Shih-na, please continue with your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">The knife is part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">About the three-piece set, is there really no other like it?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Let's ask Ambassador Palaeno for more details, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">The knives are indeed special. They have the butterfly, the symbol of the Republic of Babahl, engraved on them. And because there are only three of them in the world, they are very, very valuable.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The national symbol, huh? Well, the knives are covered in the butterfly design...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Along with the Allebahstian set, our respective countries only have three knives each.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Are you satisfied now? If so, let's continue.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, I believe there is still room for debate, and I'll thank you to not decide that for me.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I didn't decide anything for you. I'm merely looking at reality the way it is.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Are you sure you're not just viewing the facts through rose-colored glasses?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">............</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... I think she's mad at you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Perhaps. <thought>But our definitions of reality are a tad different.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Are the two of you done chatting?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Shih-na's proof is the Babahlese knife that Kay was allegedly holding.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah... So, um, how are you going to prove that Kay didn't do it, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If Agent Shih-na wants to suspect Kay merely because Kay was the only one here... ...then I must show with evidence that Kay couldn't have committed the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Um, but do you have such evidence, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. There is one piece of evidence that seems very unnatural to me. ...And I believe it is my duty to point that out to Agent Shih-na.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So the murder weapon was the knife with the butterfly design on it. But is that really the truth?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">What are you getting at?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd like for you to take a look at this. There is blood on the blade, and yet, there's not a speck of blood on the middle. This signifies that at the time of the crime, a different handle was attached to this blade. The knife that Kay was holding... ...had its handle switched, and was, in fact, not the real murder weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">It wasn't... the real murder weapon!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This knife can be taken apart. Shall we give it a go?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As you can see, the Babahlese knife has now been disassembled into two parts. The killer must have pulled the murder weapon out of the victim's body... ...and proceeded to swap the knife's original handle with this butterfly one. It was all to create the illusion that Mr. Coachen was killed with the butterfly-themed knife!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Uurrnngh... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This should clear up any and all suspection surrounding Kay.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Your argument isn't airtight yet!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is quite a bit of Mr. Coachen's blood on this blade. Thanks to being a prosecutor, I guess I have become accustomed to seeing blood...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's an engraving of the national symbol of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...which is a flower. Though hidden by the handle, it shows that the knife was conceived in patriotism.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A knife handle with a butterfly on it. I wonder where the blade that this should be attached to is...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How so?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">It's possible... that the girl herself is the one who switched the handles.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't be ridiculous! For what purpose would she do such a thing!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I don't care to know how a criminal thinks. The way they view the world is beyond the comprehension of a normal person like myself. Therefore, I wouldn't put anything past them, no matter how odd it may seem.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Heh. The truth is right there in front of you, and this knife will show you the way! You will come to see that Kay is not and could not have been Mr. Coachen's killer!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is quite a bit of Mr. Coachen's blood on this blade. Thanks to being a prosecutor, I guess I have become accustomed to seeing blood... But this is not what is important right now!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">What is this mark on here?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the mark of a flower. I assume you know what this means?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">No, not really. Butterflies rest on flowers all the time to drink their sweet nectar.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...And so they do. <thought>However, would this butterfly really drink the nectar of this flower? The answer is clearly... not a chance! Now to prove the relationship between the butterfly and the flower with this!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This piece of evidence will make everything clear to you!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I can't quite figure out what you're trying to prove with that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I! That is...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">If you are that uncertain, then I demand you try again!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nngh... Yes, that's exactly what I was about to do. <thought>It would appear that this piece of evidence was not sufficient enough. I should think this over once again, calmly and rationally... The flower mark engraved into the blade... and the butterfly on the handle... There must be something that can put these two symbols into the correct context for us!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">! Y-You can't be serious...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... It appears that you've made the connection. The flower on this blade is designed after a certain country's national symbol. That's right... The Kingdom of Allebahst. In other words... This blade is from one of Allebahst's ornamental knives!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Aah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This part of the knife handle... ...has Babahl's national symbol of the butterfly on it. Therefore, it is undeniably Babahlese in origin! But as we both know, you can't kill someone with just a knife handle. Incidentally, when exactly did the murder occur again, Agent Shih-na?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Ack! After the fire had broken out...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right. Kay entered the Babahlese Embassy after the fire had taken place. Furthermore, she had not been to the Allebahstian side of the building before then. On top of that, not a single person passed between the two countries during the fire... ...which means that Kay could not have transported an Allebahstian object over here! This makes it impossible for her to be the true killer!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">..................!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Whooooop! Way to go Mr. Edgeworth, sir! What a great victory!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..................</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">..................</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">..................</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh? Hey, why is everyone so quiet...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I'm happy we got this far and cleared Kay's name... ...but what worries me now is what will happen next.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What is the meaning of this!? An Allebahstian knife, here...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you mean... how did this find its way to the Republic of Babahl? It didn't just find its way over. Rather, we should focus on how it was smuggled over!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You know what!? My brain hurts thinking about it while we're just standing around! Thinking while you're on the run? Now THAT'S the way a real Great Thief operates!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, thanks a bunch, Mr. Edgeworth! For proving me innocent, I mean! You believed in me the whole time, right? Tell me you did!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm, not really, but...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ha ha. Come on, you don't have to be shy about it!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Your argument is still not airtight.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Would you care to elaborate?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I understand now that the girl didn't commit the murder. However, there is still the possibility that she is the Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That again!? Look, how many times do I have to explain it to you!? I am the real Yatagarasu! I'm not like that fake one that goes around setting fires, OK!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Whether you're the real deal or a fake, it doesn't really matter. All I have to say is this: I have my suspicions that this girl is the one who started the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Preposterous! On what grounds do you suspect her of such a thing!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">The fact that she calls the Yatagarasu. That in itself is a more elegant proof.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ms. Shih-na.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I... have no intention of taking back any of what I've said.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I am the Great Thief Yatagarasu. And I refuse to allow some imposter to claim that name as their own! The path of justice that my father pointed me towards... I will talk it the best I can!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">It's not good to be so stubborn. I hope you can understand that.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Thanks a lot for the concern, Ms. Shih-na! Let me share something with you, too, as a token of my appreciation! Those sunglasses totally do nothing for you, so I'll steal them from you next time, OK!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Wh--!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, I guess we'd better get going!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Going...? To where?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">To the Kingdom of Allebahst! If we don't go, we won't know for sure, right?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I suppose not... We won't get anywhere simply by standing here thinking. To see where the Allebahstian knife came from... ...we'll have to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. Let's go, Miles Edgeworth. As you are my subordinate... I will not tolerate you bringing the investigation to a halt.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Understood.</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Count off!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Shifu! 99 callouts! So all 99 members are most likely here and accounted for, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Hey, you. Yeah, you, the second #1 from my right.</line>
<line speaker="Officer">Sir! Yes, sir!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Here... A birthday present for you.</line>
<line speaker="Officer">Wha...??</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Shifu! I didn't know that you knew all of our birthdays...!</line>
<line speaker="Officer">What a kind heart you have! Shifu, you are more of a man than we'll ever be, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Officer">Umm... I'm really sorry, but it's not my birthday...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "A cub who dis-respects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder." That present isn't for you. It's for your younger brother's wife's younger brother. ...Tell him I said "hi", and "happy birthday", won't you?</line>
<line speaker="Officer">Y...Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Shifu! I can't believe you remember that much about each of us!</line>
<line speaker="Officer">Shifu! I... I'm so moved that I can't stop crying!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I should probably leave them to their "alone time".</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Alright, meeting's over. Everyone... head for your posts! Dismissed!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yo, were you guys there the whole time? I got a call from Shih-na, and she's already filled me in. It sounds like you're out to get in my way again.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have absolutely no intention of interrupting your investigation. I simply request that you grant me permission to investigate the Allebahstian Embassy.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hmph. And what if I say no?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Agent Lang! This man is my subordinate. As I have received permission from the ambassador, he is to be extended the same rights.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Sorry, sis, but it's not that simple. Allebahst has the strictest immigration regulations in the world, or didn't you know? Even among my elite men, about only half of them were admitted into the country. Besides, any more cooks in the kitchen, and we might spoil the soup, if you get what I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">How dare you make such assumptions!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Don't take this the wrong way, but I thought I was in charge of Allebahst, Ms. von Karma.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Grrr!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Look, try to understand, OK? Things over in Allebahst are a bit of a mess right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What do you mean by "a bit of a mess"?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">No one told you? We had an "incident" in Allebahst as well. This is what we call a decision based on the investigation, Mr. Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Look, Wolfy! Just let us in already!</line>
<line speaker="???">Is there a problem here, Agent Lang?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not really. Just having a "discussion" about whether or not to let these guys in.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Ambassador Alba, I ask that you please allow these people to join in the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Alba">Having a debate because of my country... I'm terribly sorry for placing you good people in that kind of situation... It is all because I lacked the strength to govern well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please, it is nothing of the sort, Ambassador...</line>
<line speaker="Alba">You weakling, Quercus! Curse your frailty and inability to affect change in your country!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-What are you--!?</line>
<line speaker="Alba">The thing is, investigations conducted in my country have been under Agent Lang. And it is my judgement that in order to minimize disruption in the investigation... ...I should leave everything up to Agent Lang.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...There, you see?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, no way!</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Ambassador Alba, I ask you to please reconsider letting them into Allebahst.</line>
<line speaker="Alba">What's that...?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">My very own secretary has been murdered in the Babahlese Embassy. And he was apparently caught up in some very shady dealings completely unbeknownst to me. So I ask for your cooperation in our investigation. These aren't much, but I hope they can cover your travel expenses to Babahl someday.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Alright, alright. I get it. Even if you beg Ambassador Alba, I still have to give the final OK anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Alright! You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? We're in!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast, my little crow-girl. You're still a witness in the Babahl murder. So I'd like you to please stay in the Republic of Babahl.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe. Please take good care of Kay for me.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Sounds good to me. The fewer troublemakers, the better.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">......... *rasp!*</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">*rasp!*</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So I wanted to ask for a while now, but... ...that lady over there, is she who I think she is!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ah, that's right. I didn't introduce the two of you yet.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Franziska von Karma, the prosecutorial prodigy. ...It's nice to see you again.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ooh, I knew it! You're the whip lady!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">.........You may address me as Ms. von Karma.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ms. von Karma, I leave the investigation of Allebahst in your hands!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Thanks. Rest assured, I will outsmart both the smuggling ring and the Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The smuggling ring, huh... Perhaps I should ask Franziska a bit more about them before I head into Allebahst. Ah, and I mustn't forget to thank Ambassador Palaeno for all that he has done for me.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Guard">You have been granted permission to enter by Ambassador Alba. Please, feel free to enter the Flower Nation, the Kingdom of Allebahst.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm, The "Flower Nation", you say? </line>
<line speaker="Guard">Yes, it does! Our rose garden, which is in full bloom right now, is really something else!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh, if only it wasn't. I could enjoy myself a bit more then.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The national flag of the Kingdom of Allebahst is on display here. The crest on it features a flower. The knife with the flower design on it that we found in the Babahlese Embassy... It would appear that it is definitely connected to the Kingdom of Allebahst.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can see the courtyard and the Allebahstian Embassy through this window. But this side is under the same dire straits as the Babahlese side. An incident has occurred on both sides of this one building. Why must fate make everything in my life so full of complexities?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These flowers are a gift from the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. It appears that their business has boomed since they became a Steel Samurai sponsor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You've made so much progress in your investigation in such a short period of time. It's truly amazing.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Agent Hicks, whose help I had requested, was cut down before he completed his task. There is no room for further failure in my perfect investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......... In spite of that, I believe you were able to obtain some insight into the ring, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It was nothing. I simply made some deductions based on the smuggled item I was following.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You mean the Babahlese ink? But why are there restrictions on the export of Babahlese ink to begin with?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That's classified Interpol infor...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska! As your subordinate, I'm a part of your investigation now. Don't you think it would be beneficial if I was as well-informed as you?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">.........Point taken. Very well, I'll fill you in. Recently. we discovered some very well-made counterfeit bills circulating in Zheng Fa.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Counterfeit bills?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Yes... As you may have deduced... ...the counterfeits are being made with Babahl's special Babahlese ink. And it's virtually impossible to distinguish bills made with Babahlese ink from real ones. Thus, it was only natural for Interpol to keep an eye on the Republic of Babahl.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's where this document comes into play, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Correct. Mr. Coachen was smuggling large amounts of Babahlese ink. Furthermore, he was charged with running the Embassy's printing equipment. That's all the evidence I need to know that he was the head of the smuggling ring. However, there remains one tiny problem.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let me guess. You still have yet to find the counterfeit bills or the smuggled ink?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Yes, and while we're listening things, I might as well add the counterfeit plates to the pile. Since we haven't been able to locate any of these items in the Babahlese Embassy... ...we're looking into the Allebahstian Embassy next. It doesn't matter where they're hidden, mark my words, I will find them.'</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, I am in your debt.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">No, no, it's nothing. Because it's about all I can do for you, I'm afraid. I only ask that you please bring Manny's killer to justice.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will, Ambassador. On my honor.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Wooow, you're so sensational! You've really piqued my curiosity! I know they aren't much, but know that I'm giving them to you wholeheartedly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, that's quite alright.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, well... How about this, then?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what exactly is it?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">It's fountain pen ink. Known as "Babahlese ink", it's made exclusively in Babahl.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So this is Babahlese ink...</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">We make it from whitcrystal oil, which is mined through our mineral mines. Please accept this ink. One dip of your fountain pen in this... ...and you can write for hours in your organizer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How fortunate for me. The ink in my pen just happened to have run out. I gladly accept your gracious gift.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Great! Wonderful! I guarantee to you that writing with our ink is an unforgettable experience. And since we don't export it... ...if you run out, you're always welcome to come and visit our fair nation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Talk about cornering the customer along with the market...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There are stacks of pamphlets about the two embassies here.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, Mr. Edgeworth. Please take as many as you would like! You'll find that you can cut out the last page and use it as a coupon.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm afraid I must decline, as I have little interest in them.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Wait, I thought Americans loves coupons? That man in the green coat earlier was beyond ecstatic when I gave him some.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, I ask that you please not think of him as representative of all Americans.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Steel Samurai and Jammin' Ninja stage shows were held just beyond these doors. After the Jammin' Ninja's show ended, we came out here, and were greeted with a fire... ...then the appearance of the Yatagarasu, and a murder; we're far from solving anything yet.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay... I'm glad you were not hurt, but please refrain from such recklessness, alright? What if you had run into the Yatagarasu? You could've been killed.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Sorry to make you worry like that... I'll be more careful from now on.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Good girl. It's good to conduct some self-reflection every once in a while.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eheheheh... It's funny, you know. When I talk with you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...it's like I'm talking with my father.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... I-Is that so...? <thought>Do I really seem that old to her...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe, I'm counting on you to keep Kay safe.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir! You just leave eeeeeverything to me, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And don't worry, I'll take good care of Gummy for you!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">We'll go investigate into the Babahl side of things together! Right, Kay!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right, Gummy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...All they're missing is the last stooge.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a flat-panel, a VCR, and a row of Steel Samurai videos on this table. There might be a clue among these... I had better check the titles of these videos. My my, the things I put myself through for the sake of the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These flowers are a gift from Global Studios. They seem to be prospering quite a bit, thanks to their constant stream of hit shows.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The Babahlese Embassy is just outside this window. The burn marks on it look pretty bad. It's a shame that they were in the middle of renovations. The fire did little to help there. And behind me, Ambassador Palaeno's dry smile hides the tears in his eyes...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The national flag of the Republic of Babahl is on display here. The crest on it features a butterfly. The Babahlese Embassy, which sits to the right of the theater... ...and the Allebahstian Embassy which sits to the left... Something has happened in each of the two embassies. I sense that unconventional methods will be required to solve both of these mysteries.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... May I ask you to please move out of the way?</line>
<line speaker="Guard">I'm sorry, sir, but we are currently clearing the area beyond of fallen, burnt brush. I ask for your patience until we are done.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well... Oh, and I hope the brush-clearing goes smoothly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, shall we get going?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's wrong, Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I didn't get permission to enter Allebahst... ...so we're going to go gather whatever info we can over on the Babahlese side, OK!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Alright, I'm counting on you two.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Right, and I'm counting on you and Ms. von Karma to sniff out clues in Allebahst! Oh, and Mr. Edgeworth! If you happen to come across my phony, you let me know, OK!? If you tell me, I'll rush on over straight away no matter where you are!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.................. I'll let you know when the time comes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Hm?</thought> Gwoooooooh!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What do you think you're doing to my subordinate!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Y...You're...!</line>
<line speaker="???">Edgey...! Oh, thank the heavens you're here...! I'm in a really, really big pickle, Your Lordship! The Raven, it appeared, poof! And then disappeared, swoosh! And though I am the Steel Samurai, my sword, it... Waaaaaaaaah! I'm so confused, I don't know what anything means anymore!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Who is this fruitcake!?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I am Larry of the House of Butz: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo, m'lady!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Now I remember. This... person is one of your friends, isn't he, Miles?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, frighteningly enough... he is.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hey! What's up with that answer!? your best bud is in a bind, and you act like it's no big deal!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What sort of "bind" are we talking about here...?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">The suspect kind! I accidentally became a suspect in a murdeeeeeer!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. That is quite the bind.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Not that we're in the least bit surprised.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I pretty much expected this news... ...from the instant I saw this unlucky face. <thought>His name is Larry Butz. I've known him since grade school, and for as long as I've known him... ...he has been the world's largest source of Trouble with a capital T.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hey! What kind of introduction is that!? You're so mean, Edgey! If you're not careful, you might find your tiny number of friends go down by one!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That was uncalled for. Besides, you're............ Wait, hold on. Laaaaaaryyyy! It was you!? YOU'RE the one who wrote my Steel Samurai autograph!?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hm? Oh, you didn't notice earlier? I even winked at you through my headpiece.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">.........What's going on? And why are you beet-red?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sorry... but could you not speak to me right now...?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Oh, sorry, am I interrupting your comical, yet melodramatic play?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! .........Aha. So this is the incident you mentioned earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor, this man... this childhood friend of yours... is our prime suspect. Of what, you ask? Of the murder of a man who had snuck into this embassy, Mask☆DeMasque II!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mask☆DeMasque II...? .................. <thought>Only Larry could get himself into yet another mess as fine as this. But no matter what the facts seem to say, Larry is not the type to commit murder. Still, it's a rather daunting stroke of misfortune I've struck. I have to prove... that Larry Butz is innocent of all wrongdoing!</thought></line>
<line speaker="MIB">Shifu! We've identified the victim!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Good work. I'll take that report now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, would you mind if I took a peek at it as well?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What did I tell you earlier, Mr. Prosecutor? Don't get in my way! There's only enough flesh here to feed one wolf, and that one is me! So, no, you may not take a "peek".</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But Agent Lang...!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Agent Lang. Will you... allow an investigator such as myself... to take a look?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Ah, yes. Of course. ...You, let the detective see the file.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're... Detective Badd!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">You're... the prosecutor, Mr. Edgeworth, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Fancy meeting you here, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">You weren't expecting me...? Ever since that day seven years ago... I've chased after the Yatagarasu... non-stop. I even pressured Interpol... into keeping me in the loop... in case a card was ever found.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What incredible dedication to the case.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Detective Badd knows the Yatagarasu's M. O. very well. And his passion for the chase hasn't died down in these seven long years. It's something... I can respect. But, Detective Badd, I must ask: are you going to make an ally out of this prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">My only goal is to arrest the Yatagarasu. If he can get to the bottom of this case, then I'm willing to share info with him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I am in your debt, Detective Badd.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">About the murder of DeMasque II... Would you be willing to fill me in on a few of the details?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">When the Yatagarasu showed up... Agent Lang and I took ourselves off guard duty... ...and put ourselves in charge of directing things... at this crime scene. Taking advantage of the chaos... ...DeMasque II... he broke into this embassy... Probably... to steal some treasure or another...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And I suppose he lost his life when he was forced to fight someone else in this room?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why exactly was that man placed under arrest, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">That... samurai?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He was born looking suspicious, but not for the reasons you suspect, I assure you. As you can plainly see, he is completely harmless.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Well, it was just a random guess... It's not like he's actually under arrest... Tonight... here, at the Allebahstian Embassy... ...Ambassador Alba... was to give a commemorative speech... And that's when... the Yatagarasu showed. But keep in mind... the Yatagarasu isn't who I'm talking about right now... Those seats... for the guests who had been called to sit in them... were empty.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A no-show...? Who was it that failed to take their seat?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">The Steel Samurai. Until the speech was to begin, each member of the entire Steel Samurai family... ...was to wait in a separate room, However, for some weird reason... ...that man... was spotted in a different location than his assigned room... at that time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And where was he?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">He was on the roof... with one of his legs down a chimney... ...That chimney... leads directly into this room...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnrrrgh...! <thought>Larry Butz...! You've really outdone yourself this time! What were you thinking!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wonder if you might take a look at this, Detective Badd?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Yeah... I heard. Coachen's dead... ...What a waste. ............</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He's staring at his mirror with his eyes unfocused and his jaw clenched tight...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Badd, this is something you absolutely need to see.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">! What... is that doing here? I've been looking for that... for seven long years. Never in my wildest dreams... did I imagine... this turn of events. Without a doubt... this means that "she"... is involved. That Yew woman!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Badd, if you could please take a look at this for me?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...I see. The truth... that lies beyond this piece of evidence... is not going to be fun. Are you ready to take it on?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course I am!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">I don't know how close to the truth you are... ...but there are only a few things... I can say. So listen up, and listen well... Don't ever lose your detective's spirit.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That would be a good piece of advice... if I was a detective.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Badd, I'm wondering if you might be able to tell me something about this?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Sorry, but I don't give a hoot about things that aren't related to the Yatagarasu...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Heh... It looks like nothing about you has changed in these seven years, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Hmph... Daughter of Von Karma, you're still just a sapling of a prosecutor, so..</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Arngh! I-I'll have you know that I've already grown into a stately tree of a prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Heh... Is that right...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is he just toying with Franziska...? He seems to be enjoying this quite a bit.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In any case, I believe it's high time for me to start my investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I've only just arrived in this room myself, which is why we need to investigate some more.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I agree.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Our priority should be on understanding what the current situation is.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Of course. I was planning to do that from the very beginning.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">In that case, hurry up and start the investigation already!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I will! So let's get started! <thought>In order to find out the truth behind what happened here... ...I should start by gathering as much information as I can.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Mask☆DeMasque... I see that yet another weirdo has popped up in my absence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, and as I understand it, he was a brilliant thief to whom the world was his oyster. He stole extremely valuable objects one after another for a while. Detective Gumshoe was in charge of the case, and not once did he catch DeMasque.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Hmph... I had already researched all that, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Last year, when DeMasque gave himself up and was finally arrested... ...he was apparently represented by that man. Knowing him, I'm almost curious as to how insane that trial turned out to be.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Indeed...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>But why would anyone want to kill DeMasque? I should really find out some more about the victim...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What exactly is that hideous, fashion faux pas of a costume he's wearing supposed to be? I feel like I've seen it somewhere before... ...but there's something different about it than what I remember.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That costume is from the very first Steel Samurai. It's a live-action superheroes show on television, beloved by children and adults alike. The Steel Samurai's weapon is the Samurai Spear. And it is with the Samurai Spear that he performs his special attacks... ...which enthrall all who watch them in action.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You seem to know quite a bit.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">N-Not at all! And in any case, Franziska... ...I believe the Samurai you are familiar with is the second one... ...the Nickel Samurai, which was part of that case last year. Do you recall that case?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">! Y-Yes, I remember... Although, I'd much rather it stay buried in the depths of my mind...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Not that I blame her... She was shot during the course of that trial. I fear she may still be suffering great trauma over the shooting...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Nnrgh... Anyway, that aside... ...it looks like the Steel Samurai is the suspect this time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, although that's because of who is inside the costume rather than the character... Ack! That's right! If HE is the Steel Samurai...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth, have you been in shock over something this whole time?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">N-No, I'm not in shock over anything... <thought>I wanted to forget that I had received the Steel Samurai autograph from Larry... But... the autograph... The drawing of the Samurai Spear and the caricature of his face... Why did he waste so much time on the most useless parts of the autograph!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hm? Hey, Edgey! Did you say something?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">NO! I didn't say anything!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Recently, incredibly well-forged counterfeit bills have been found coming out of Zheng Fa. Counterfeits made using Babahlese ink, that is. That smuggling ring that I've been chasing is the group behind the whole operation. But mark my words, no one involved in it will escape my whip! They will all know pain! Hmph!!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-What am I getting whipped for!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Passionflowers... They are a most beautiful flower.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. They are a magnificent species.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">But always be mindful of the fact that beautiful flowers have painful thorns.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......... <thought>I suppose that advice coming from a woman with a whip is best heeded...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">There are decorative plants here as well... This room is overflowing with nature.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Humans used to live in the grandeur of nature once, long ago. I believe I'm not mistaken in thinking that those people truly loved nature.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Hmph. This is coming from a man who loves shows featuring costumed actors.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Arngh! She just had to go there again, didn't she?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There was a grandfather clock just like this one earlier in the Babahlese Embassy. You know, symmetry is a fine thing, but their interior design really suffers for it.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Really? I think this clock actually fits the décor of this room quite well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose the wood does suit the all-natural atmosphere of this room.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Its design and the material it's made of strikes a good balance with the plants.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hey! You two! Now's not the time to be talking about interior decorating, you know! Hurry up and save me!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Be quiet!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Ack!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">This is all a part of my elite investigation. All you need to do is be quiet and watch.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Actually, I do believe Larry has a point for once.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What is that plant supposed to be?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska, can't you see that it's supposed to be a likeness of Ambassador Alba?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth! As a subordinate, you have a lot of nerve telling me what to think! ...I look forward to your next salary assessment next month.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>You are deluding yourself if you think you have any control over that!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, there are a few things I need to ask you about.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hey, how about that!? I've got a few things I've gotta ask you, too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......... What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">It's like... both you and him... How is it that the two of you always manage to have some cute or hot girl by your side!? And Franzy! What about that promise you made to me!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Promise...? What promise...?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">The one where you said you would model for my next book, "Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip"! Yeeoowww!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I made no such promise!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ever since grade school, we've had a certain saying about Larry. "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." One needs to look no further than this man to find the King of Troublemakers!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As I recall, aren't you calling yourself Laurice Dounim now?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">That's "Deauxnim"! Laurice Deauxnim! Get that straight in your head, Edgey! Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Now I remember... You're that rude, pale imitation of a real artist.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">No, no, no! You've got it all wrong. I gave up on that whole Laurice business! Besides, when Banjolina left me and my heart in pieces... ...that's when Mindy walked into my life. She's been so good to me that I wanted to help her in some way... ...and I figured I could through this Steel Samurai outfit!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Your inane blathering makes less and less sense each time we meet.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe he's saying that he picked up this part-time job as the Steel Samurai so that... ...he may attempt to capture the heart of the actress who plays the Pink Princess.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">You got it! I knew you'd know what I meant, Edgey!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Not really. It's not so much as I understood... ...but a simple deduction based on your usual modus operandi, Larry.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, I'd like you to confess right now... to everything you did tonight.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">C-C-Confess!? Hey! Don't tell me you suspect me, too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nonsense. I don't believe you have the mental acuity needed to plan and execute a murder. However, we are talking about you here, so I find it hard to believe that nothing happened. For past experience has taught me that you are always at the center of some insane event!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">E-E-Edgey! How can you be so mean, stabbing me with your words like that!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Unfortunately, I don't have the time to search out a key to unlock your heart this time. So I suggest that you cooperate and tell me what you know.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">OK, OK! I get it! Just stop Franzy from whipping me from behind! So... I guess you know what I did, right, Edgey?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I can't even begin to imagine. However... ...I imagine that whatever you were up to was probably beyond my imagination. So you will tell me what exactly you did, Larry!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Nope, not yet, Edgey! It'll take more than that to loosen my lips! A lot moooooooooooore!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Confess. Now.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Ooooghnnn... OK, well, I was up on the roof.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And why exactly were you up there?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Oh, you know, that wintry custom and the legendary hero!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Legendary...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hero...?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Santa Claus!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Santa...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Claus...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I wanted to do that thing he does, so I climbed up to one of the chimneys! But when I got there, there was smoke pouring out of the chimney <thought>Smoke from chimney - Smoke was pouring out of the chimney when Larry thought to climb down it.</thought>.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...And?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Well, I couldn't go down the chimney with smoke coming up, right? So, I gave up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, you do realize that Santa Claus does not exist, right?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Of course I know! I did graduate from junior high, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then you should also understand this: If Santa was real... he would be the biggest unlawful trespasser in history!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Aw, cruuuuuuuuuuud!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It is your attempt to imitate Santa that has landed you as prime suspect in this murder!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Come on, man. What's so wrong with pretending to be Santa...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's start with the fact that it will be the ides of March in a matter of hours. Santa only visits homes on December 24th! That's in December, you nitwit!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Nooooooooooooooooooooooo! Hey, wait a sec! We're not in court!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, about the Samurai Sword that was used as the murder weapon...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Oh, that. Well, I shook hands with the ambassador in this room, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes.. apparently you did.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">And, well, I totally forgot about it and left it behind when I left afterwards! You wanna talk about shock, I was the most shocked of all when I heard it killed someone! Shooooooooooocked!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Foolish fool looking especially foolish for foolishly stating such a foolish excuse... You forgot to take something that big with you!? Who would believe such a tale!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Sorry, Ms. von Karma, but I believe him. Because if anyone could forget something like that, it would be Larry.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Edgeyyyy... You believe meeeee...! I just knew that our friendship is something special!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Anyway... even if Larry had simply forgotten the sword and left it behind... ...that, in no way, clears his name. Which means that I will have to prove his innocence from a different angle.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">Oh, hey, it's the Steel Samurai.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I want you to answer this question for me, Larry, and depending on the answer, I may let you live. The Steel Samurai that was up there on that stage... Was that really you?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Yup, sure was!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">L-Laaaarrrrryyyyyyyyy! Yooooooooooou...!!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Steel Samurai Sushi Slice!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! <thought>I was moved by the performance of this man!? This completely useless, worthless bum!? I fear I may never recover from this...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hey! That's an official Steel Samurai weapon! Huh? What? You want me to do it? Oh, you have no idea how many fans ask that of me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">? What are you prattling on about now?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Steel Samurai Sushi Slice!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">How was that? I bet it sent shivers up your spine!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......... <thought>Ack! I let myself get caught up in being a spectator! How could I have failed myself!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, I wonder if you might know what this is?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Nope, not a clue!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You didn't even look at it!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Nah, that's because the only thing I can see right now is the form of my lovely Franzy!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Oh? In that case, allow me to help you sear my form into you for all eternity!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Eek! Aaaah! Whippity-Whip Triiiiip!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now THIS is a trip I'm willing to endorse, especially if we can finally get some peace here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There are some weapons on display on this wall. A crossbow... and under that... ...a set of knives bearing a flower motif. They must be the counterparts to the Babahlese knives. Which means that the blades inside these scabbards... ...should match the blade that was used to kill Mr. Coachen.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the Steel Samurai's primary weapon, the Samurai Spear.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Isn't it awesome!? I totally fell for this thing! It's sleek and shiny, just like my heart! It comes at you like, whoosh! When you hold it, you just wanna live life like, BAM!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You'd do well to watch what you say, Larry. <thought>Although, it is just as Larry says. The spear is quite the symbol of valor. However, speaking of spears... ...aren't you supposed to use them by thrusting the point straight into your opponent...? ...I'm not entirely convinced this spear is up to the task.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">What's wrong, Edgey? You're just staring off into the distance! Oh! I get it! Tell you what. I'll tell the studio to make you one, OK? But this one's mine!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did I say anything about wanting one!? <thought>Maybe I can shut him up if I show him the piece of evidence... ...that will point something out about this spear.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the Steel Samurai's primary weapon, the Samurai Spear. By damaging the Samurai Spear, Larry... ...it is clear that you still lack the proper awareness to be a real actor.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Well, it's not like I'm training to be a pro! Oh, but I guess you can call me a pro at getting caught up in all sorts of mischief!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...You also seem to be a pro at being defiant in the face of punishment for said mischief.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why is there a weapon on display in a place like this?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I wonder why there are no whips on display here?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Knives adorned with flowers are on display here. I suspect that these are the counterparts to the Babahlese knives. The blades of these knives should match the blade of the knife that killed Mr. Coachen. Wh--!? One of the knifes is missing its blade. Let's see if the two pieces, the blade and handle, fit each other.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It would appear that they fit together quite well, almost seamlessly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then this means that an Allebahstian knife did find its way into Babahl! But how...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The knife display is set up almost identically to the one in the Babahlese Embassy.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I believe Ambassador Palaeno said that both Allebahst and Babahl... ...have a set of three knives each.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It would appear that way. Also, the knives here all have flowers on their handles.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The two countries embellished their knives with their gun national symbols, I guess. And just like the Yatagarasu's Key, they are exquisitely made. This level of craftsmanship makes these knives worthy of being owned by me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I believe you already have all the dangerous toys you will ever need, Franziska.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I can spot absolutely no difference between this Primidux Statue and Babahl's.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The statue's face looks a bit like that costumed hero you like so very much. I only wonder why you Americans have such an affinity for this kind of face?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The statue wasn't made by an American, you know. At least, I don't suppose so.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The contradiction of this here is related to this piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...I don't see how they're related in any way.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gnnrgh! .............................. Hmph... Franziska. This is not like you at all. Don't tell me that you don't understnd the meaning behind this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Well, I don't.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose I have no choice then. I'll just have to explain it to you from the beginning.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What you should be doing from the very beginning is admitting your mistake!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gnwaaaah! <thought>Sh-She saw right through me...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, about this spear...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Oh! Are you feeling it? BAM!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I thought there was something strange about this spear... Tell me, Larry. Is it just me or is the spear a bit bent?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What!? No way! It's exactly as it should be, yo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have here the autograph you wrote for me earlier. Now, take a good look at this which you drew with your own hands. You can see that spear is clearly of a different shape!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">A...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What do you have to say to that!?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I-I'm soooooooorry! When I hold the spear in my hands, all of a sudden I feel super powerful... And then, during practice, I was spinning it around and around... ...and BAM! It hit the waaaaaaaaaall!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You unbelievable--! This is an EMBASSY!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">But I've always been like that... ever since I was a kid. One time on an overnight field trip, I bought a fake sword and played with it late that night. I'm just a useless, hot-blooded maaaaaaaaaaan!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, clarify that for me, will you?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">OK, so it was some field trip, and I began to shadow-fight with myself...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Not that! I meant what you said earlier, about spinning the spear and hitting the wall!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Oh, that! It's no biggie. It's not like I left a hole or anything!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's not why I'm asking, Larry. The Samurai Spear is made of metal. I somehow doubt that a move as simple as spinning it around would cause it to bend.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Man, Edgey, you're so naïve!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-What!? Where did that come from!?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Well, you keep calling it the Samurai Spear. But it's not real. You can't really fight someone with it... ...because it's hollow on the inside! You could hit it against practically anything and it would bend.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-Is that so...?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Don't tell me you thought it was real? Oh, but don't take it the wrong way. I just think that part of your personality is cute.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I see. Your friendship truly is something "special", Miles Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Arngh! That's not "friendship"; it's "utter humiliation"!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There... was the exact same statue sitting in that Babahlese office we examined.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It's the Primidux Statue. It was the national treasure of the Principality of Cohdopia. There was only one of these statues, meaning that one of the two is a replica. But both Allebahst and Babahl claim to have the real thing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What an incredibly childish fight to have.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>There was almost the exact same wall mount for the knives on the Babahlese side. But I can't see any of the details from this distance.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's a Primidux Statue. There was one of these on the Babahlese side as well.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I hear it's very valuable and made of pure gold. It was the national treasure of Cohdopia. There was only one of these statues... ...meaning that one of the two is a replica. But both Allebahst and Babahl claim to have the real thing and won't budge from their claim.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What an incredibly childish fight to have.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is clearly... a contradiction here!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Yes, I believe you're right. Clearly, it's right there in your logic!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh! <thought>Apparently, I was mistaken.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">That sure looks like fun, Edgey!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, it's not! <thought>And let's not forget for whose sake I am suffering! I hope you're considering that!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Look at this photo, and tell me what you find odd about this scene, Ms. von Karma.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...The apparent joy on the ambassador's face as he shakes that top-knot's head?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's not it! I was trying to point out that the statue in the photo is facing a different way!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You're right!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This statue is a national treasure. As such, only an ambassador or a secretariat-level person is allowed to handle it. The fact that the statue is facing one way in this photo... ...and now it's facing a different direction in this preserved crime scene... ...is proof that someone touched this statue around the time of the crime!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The counterpart to the Babahlese butterfly is the Allebahstian flower.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The butterfly and flower. They're both lovely things... But can we interpret this to mean that Allebahst provides honey to Babahl?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska, can't you come up with a more meaningful, or profound comment?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Very well then, let's hear what sort of profound comment you can come up with.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ahem... Well, flowers cannot survive without the butterflies that spread their pollen. And butterflies cannot live without the nectar that flowers provide. If either one were to disappear from the equation, neither would survive. How was that, Ms. von Karma?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Your explanation took so long that I nearly fell asleep. Well, let's continue the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Franziska, why can't you just admit I had something there?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">You did some investigating over in the Babahlese Embassy, too, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I did. Is there a problem?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "A wolf who aims to hunt for two rabbits at once..."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe the idiom you require is, "He who runs after two hares will catch neither."</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh. A REAL wolf can catch both.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. So what are you trying to say, seeing as how I am currently handling two cases?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh... Suit yourself. But don't say I didn't warn you.</line>
<line speaker="MIB">No matter how hard you try, you'll never be a necessity in our Shifu's investigation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that a fact? But no matter how good he is, he is bound to overlook something.</line>
<line speaker="MIB">! If you insult our Shifu, then prepare to be punished!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Oh? And how exactly would you punish us?</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Every investigator under Shifu's command will work to disrupt your investigation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Vindictive much?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Badd">So... he clutched this note... as he went about his business... ...He was a poor excuse for a criminal... On top of which... he was only following in someone else's footsteps... What a small fry. I've been a detective for a long time I can see straight through these people.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He really has a different air about him. Now if only Gumshoe could understand that and be more like Detective Badd...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So this is the victim, DeMasque II...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What is with his gaudy outfit!?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">You don't know... about Mask☆DeMasque? A few months ago... this thief caused a lot of havoc on the populous.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">So this thief is separate from the Yatagarasu?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...I thought they were for a while... because their M. O. and targets were different. DeMasque likes high-value trinkets and jewels, and being gaudy is his signature. Gumshoe was in charge of that investigation, so he'd know more about DeMasque.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That's alright. All I'd probably hear are tales of his failure anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Hmph... You haven't changed a bit, I see...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In any case... let's get started here, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">There is not a single shred of fashion sense in DeMasque's costume.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, at least I can appreciate the great effort he must've put into making it.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">You two don't know? You can buy this costume almost anywhere now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It's being sold? Since when?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Since around New Year's. The streets are practically flooded with them. Turns out, DeMasque is a lot more popular than I thought he'd be.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I can't believe that foolish fool would dress in fools' clothing to act foolishly!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...We got your point about three "foolish"-es back, Franziska.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What is he holding...? It looks like a piece of paper from a notepad. It would appear that directions on how to reach this room were written by hand. Hm? There is something written on the back as well.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">..."I'd like you to steal the Primidux Statue in this room"... What is that supposed to mean? Who writes a note to themselves like that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If I had to guess from the text... ...I would say that this is actually a request from someone about what to steal. <thought>Just who is the person that requested the theft of the Primidux Statue?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I suppose this was the wrapping cloth DeMasque II used to carry his stolen goods. But there's nothing wrapped in it now. I guess he never did manage to get his hands on whatever it was he was out to steal.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I thought that DeMasque had quit the business?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">This guy... he's just a copycat using the name. A phony "successor"... He's... just another petty thief... His real identity... is an out-of-work guy... by the name of Ka-Shi Nou. He's 29... and wanted on larceny charges. From his clothes... and what he was carrying... ...we determined... that this guy is the real DeMasque II...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The cause of death appears to be the loss of blood from the back of his head. It seems that he was struck with something very hard. In other words, he was bludgeoned to death.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So this is the murder weapon in this case.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">There's blood on the blade. It's rather sweeping sword, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What did you expect? It's Steel Samurai Daddy's secondary weapon. I only call it his secondary because although he uses his sword in most of his battles... ...it's his trusty Samurai Spear that he turns to in a real fight.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You sure know quite a bit about the Steel Samurai.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's only because I saw the stage show earlier. <thought>The owner of this sword is the Steel Samurai... or in other words, Larry. I should probably ask him about it... as detrimental as it is to proving him innocent.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The person shaking hands with the Steel Samurai in this picture is... Ambassador Alba.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It was taken just before the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Steel Samurai must be very popular. They're even using the national treasure as backdrop.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I just don't understand. What exactly is so great about top-knot there?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Clearly, there is a depth to this show that a young person like you can't fathom.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Speaking of young people... Aren't young children the target audience of this show of costumed actors?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It's a fireplace. And by the looks of it, I don't think it's been used recently.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I can't say that I see anything unusual about it.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">This must be Ambassador Alba's desk.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">His notebook is open on his desk. He must've been in the middle of some important work.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">-- Sapling Growth Log --</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It finally sprouted today.........</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Funny, it doesn't look like "important work" to me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... Two gorgeous flowers are in full bloom here. I'm sure flowers as lovely as these must have an equally as lovely name.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth! Are you done staring? I should hardly think passionflowers are all that rare.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Passionflowers? That's a rather... unusual name.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It was named by priests in the 15th century for the Passion of Christ.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......... <thought>Hmm, as they say, you learn something new every day.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Speaking of young people... Aren't young children the target audience of this show of costumed actors?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... I guess that about wraps up my investigation. Hm? That's...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Yo! Pink Princess! How you're feeling? Still feeling ill?</line>
<line speaker="P.Princess">..................</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...And yet another strange character comes out of the woodwork.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And so the Pink Princess also comes to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. <thought>I believe I may need to speak with her as well...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is no trace of this room's fireplace being used...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">And your point is?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ahem, smoke was supposedly pouring out of the chimney connected to this fireplace. At least, according to Larry. This is a contradiction of facts, is it not?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Are you sure he wasn't just disoriented or something up on that roof?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is testimony from an investigator that puts Larry at this particular chimney... ...so, no, I don't think it was a mistaken impression on Larry's part. On the other hand, the fireplace in the next room was being used at the time. Where do you suppose the smoke from that fireplace went?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Ah, I see. So what you are proposing is this. The smoke that came out of the chimney was actually from Ms. Oldbag's fire. So basically, the fireplaces of neighboring rooms... ...share one chimney <thought>Shared chimney - The office fireplace and the one in Ms. Oldbag's room share the same chimney.</thought>! Is that what you are implying?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Pink Princess. I have a few questions I'd like to ask you.</line>
<line speaker="P.Princess">..................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Pink Princess! If you would please answer... ...meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Heh... This must be what they call "fate".</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H-How could this happen two days in a roooooooooooow!?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat the--!? A-Aren't you Ms. Oldbag!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why are YOU so surprised!?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Ah, so you're the one they got to play the Steel Samurai. It's too bad I didn't realize that until now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...You are acquaintances with Larry...?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Why, yes. We worked at the same company for a little while, you know. That's why it's OK, my Edgey-poo! You don't need to be jealous!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnnnghoooooooh!</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">I was in the next room, you know, trying to get in some beauty sleep. But it was so noisy here that I couldn't fall asleep. So I came over to complain! So imagine my shock when I saw my precious Edgey-poo waiting here for me! I mean, who could've imagined that you would ever come to a show like this! I guess I've misjudged you, Edgey-poo!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You "misjudged" him...?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">I thought he was trying to avoid me, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That was no misjudgment on your part! That's PRECISELY what I was trying to do!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">But it looks like the winds have shifted and he's now willing to be chased after! I'm simply overwhelmed! Don't you worry, Edgey-poo! I'd chase you for forever! To the ends of the Earth!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Isn't that just peachy?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This is one of those rare times when Franziska and I actually see eye to eye...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now then, ahem... What are you doing here? I thought you were working at Gatewater Land as the Pink Badger...?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">What are you talking about!? That was ages ago!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That was YESTERDAY!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Look, I worked at Global Studios before, a long time ago, right? Well, they called me up this morning, kind of out of the blue, actually.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">They called you?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Apparently, the girl who plays the Pink Princess collapsed from a bad cold. It happened so suddenly, so they called me in to be her last minue replacement.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Do they not have enough people on staff at that studio...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">I really couldn't say no, so here I am, playing the role of the heroine! Instead of that Mindy girl, I mean. But the poor girl, I feel bad for her. Because they let me stand in for her, she's going to have a terrible time when she returns. I mean, I'm not exactly great at reading that strange font they use, plus I was called in to be a stand-in at the very last second, so I tripped over all the most important lines, I threw that rag doll instead of the shuriken, hit the Steel Samurai instead of the enemy, and the audience was in an uproar, but as an avant-garde actress, they'll forgive me, because I tell you, they're really just a bunch of simpletons.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...You're a rather lively old lady.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">S-So basically, you received the stand-in request this morning, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">You got it. If you need to see it, I've got it right here. Look.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...It appears that she is telling the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">I tell you, my fine acting moved the entire audience to tears!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Yes, tears of laughter, as I recall.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">But being famous has its problems too, you know. Here, take a look at this.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">It's a letter from a stalker! I was just taking my break when I found this stuck under the door to my room. Honestly, you really have to watch out for these kinds of things! Look at what is says! "Wéndy, I'll be descending on you from above tonight. Your loving knight". Hmph! How absolutely revolting! I mean, you'd think he could get my name right. There's no accent in my name!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Wait, this horrible handwriting... Where have I seen this before...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Ah, but now that you're here, Edgey-poo, I feel 100% safe.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eh? I... Where do I factor into this?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">You'd bust that evil stalker-man for my sake, wouldn't you, Edgey-poo?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well... if you allow me the liberty to handle this in my own way... ...I'll gladly dispatch a detective to your house later.</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Oh, come on, Edgey-poo! Stop being so dismissive and playing hard to get!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What were you doing at the time of the crime?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">What crime?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What--!?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">After the show was over, I've had nothing but free time on my hands. So I used the fireplace <thought>Used the fireplace - At the time of the crime, Ms. Oldbag was warming her hip in the room next door.</thought> in the room next door to keep my bad hip warm.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Well, a murder occurred in the room right next to yours!</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Is that right? Oh, Edgey-poo! I'm so scared! Hold me! Carress me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-If you could please not cling on to my personage!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">In any case, I take it then, that you failed to show up at Ambassador Alba's speech?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Oh, that. No, I didn't go. I mean, I may have the heart of a young, tender maiden... ...but my body just refuses to cooperate at times. As soon as the show ended, my hip started acting up and got stiff. I couldn't move at all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Can you provide proof of your condition?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Oh, you just go on ahead and ask the doctors in the infirmary. They're the ones who carried me from the theater all the way to this embassy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I have to admit, the thought of her not being able to leave that room is rather pleasant.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Ah, what a strange twist of events. Because they needed a stand-in, I was able to become a heroine, just like that!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I assume that the actual reason you were called in is due to a lack of personnel.</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Well, there's that too. But no matter what you say, it's obvious that I have presence. I bet that's how I caught the eye of the director. I ask you, is being beautiful really such a crime!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I suspect even the director is lamenting the lack of personnel from the depths of his heart.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">So this person will be descending on me from above tonight, huh!? Oh, Edgey-poo! I'm so scared! Hold meeeeeee!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-If you could please not cling on to my personage!</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Honestly, beautiful people have it so hard. All it took was for me to be up on that stage for a little while, and a stalker is born!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Actually, the whole time while you were up on that stage, you were in-costume. Therefore, no one should've recognized you or what you looked like underneath...</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">But there is that thing, you know. They say people can identify you by your aura. So even without seeing my face, my stalker could see the beauty within me. So you see! That's how I charm the pants off of men!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Charm? You? Preposterous.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">What's this!? A present for me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">N-No! Obviously, I can't simply give you a piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Hmph... I see. You're just embarrassed to give it to me in front of all these people. But don't worry, I can wait. A "present of love" from my Edgey-poo is beyond worth it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gnnnrk.........!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...What a bother.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If you only knew how much, Franziska...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Officer">Prosecutor von Karma! I've brought the police dog, as you requested, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Good work. You may leave now, Officer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... This dog...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I requested the assistance of a dog in our search for the Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Looks like you guys have some pretty bright dogs in this country, too.</line>
<line speaker="???">Woof! Woof!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey... You're a real cutie, aren't you? Yeah! That's a good boy!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...That's the police dog Gumshoe's been taking care of... I think its name is... Missile.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What a fitting name for a police dog that dashes out in front and attacks.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That action alone isn't exactly what's going to solve the case for us, you know.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Now, Missile. I want you to find some clues! Go!</line>
<line speaker="Missile">Woof!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Good dog. You really are quite bright, aren't you? ...Unlike a certain someone I know. Now, what do we have here? What... is this? It looks like a small hot dog, but...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? Wait, Franziska, isn't that... an official Samurai Dog?</line>
<line speaker="Missile">Grrraaaaaaarh!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Ah! No! Bad Missile! .........He ate it. I wonder if it's alright for him to eat that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's just a meat-substance snack featuring the Steel Samurai. I'm sure he'll be fine.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That's quite a bit of information you gathered there in a single, quick glance.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>We should really be focusing on why there was a Samurai Dog there in the first place.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Hm? It looks like that snack wasn't all Missile found.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? And what do we have... here...?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It appears to be a lady's undershirt. I wonder if Ambassador Alba might have an interest in cross-dressing?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I somehow doubt that. It doesn't look like the shirt would even fit him. <thought>A Samurai Dog and a lady's undershirt... What are these two items doing in a room like this? Given the circumstances, the lady's undershirt could only belong to one person. I suppose I should get this over with and ask the owner of said undershirt about it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The lady's undershirt that Missile found... Arrrngh!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Why are you getting all excited over holding on to a lady's undergarment!? Miles Edgeworth... you uncouth sea slug! If you know the owner of said undershirt, then hurry up and return it to her already!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You have it all wrong! This is evidence! And the owner of this piece of evidence was in the room next door. And yet, despite that, Missile found it in the fireplace of this room. This.. lady's undershirt...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Are you seriously claiming that it somehow passed through a solid brick wall?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Not quite. The fireplace in this room is connected to a chimney. The other fireplace in the other room is also connected to the same chimney... ...leading us to the possibility that the two fireplaces are connected to each other.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Perhaps a closer look at the back of the fireplace is in order.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>There is an X on the back wall of the fireplace. Let's see if I can't get a better look at it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Wh-What in the--!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The wall separating this room's fireplace from the next room's fireplace... ...apparently turns. As I suspected, this fireplace does indeed connect this room to the neighboring room.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The neighboring room?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There appears to be... nothing particular about the next room. <thought>But the fact that there is nothing special about the next room isn't what's important. It's the fact that there is a secret passageway through this room's fireplace (Connected fireplaces - Ambassador Alba's office fireplace is connected to the neighboring room's fireplace.</thought>!)</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">We now know that the fireplace connects the two rooms. But how exactly is that significant? You aren't going to suddenly name the old lady as DeMasque II's killer now, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, she couldn't move at all because of her stiff hip... ...so she could not have been the one. Unfortunately, I believe... ...that this fireplace has nothing whatsoever to do with DeMasque II's murder.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">We borrowed this dog from the local precinct... ...but is he really capable of handling this case? I thought police dogs are usually of a much larger breed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He may be small, but he is an excellent police dog. Furthermore, he was raised by Detective Gumshoe.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You had me thinking the dog was capable until you said that he was raised by Scruffy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, well... <thought>I suppose that wasn't the best of arguments to use...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This fireplace connects this room with the room next door. But the old bag was suffering from a stiff hip at the time and couldn't move. Which means that all of this is probably irrelevant to DeMasque II's murder.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Missile">Woof!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">He was a much bigger help than I thought he would be.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... However, there are a few aspects I don't understand about what he found.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">In that case, you should keep on investigating until you do understand. Now, my subordinate, continue with the investigation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A-Alright, I will. <thought>It is great dread that I proceed and do what I must to solve the case...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Pink Princess. I have a few questions I'd like to ask you.</line>
<line speaker="P.Princess">..................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Pink Princess! If you would please answer... ...meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Heh... This must be what they call "fate".</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H-How could this happen two days in a roooooooooooow!?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat the--!? A-Aren't you Ms. Oldbag!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why are YOU so surprised!?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Ah, so you're the one they got to play the Steel Samurai. It's too bad I didn't realize that until now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...You are acquaintances with Larry...?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Why, yes. We worked at the same company for a little while, you know. That's why it's OK, my Edgey-poo! You don't need to be jealous!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnnnghoooooooh!</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">I was in the next room, you know, trying to get in some beauty sleep. But it was so noisy here that I couldn't fall asleep. So I came over to complain! So imagine my shock when I saw my precious Edgey-poo waiting here for me! I mean, who could've imagined that you would ever come to a show like this! I guess I've misjudged you, Edgey-poo!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You "misjudged" him...?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">I thought he was trying to avoid me, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That was no misjudgment on your part! That's PRECISELY what I was trying to do!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">But it looks like the winds have shifted and he's now willing to be chased after! I'm simply overwhelmed! Don't you worry, Edgey-poo! I'd chase you for forever! To the ends of the Earth!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Isn't that just peachy?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This is one of those rare times when Franziska and I actually see eye to eye...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That Samurai Dog was yours, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Oh, of course I'm forever yours, my Edgey-Wedgey-poo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-If you could just stick to what I asked you!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Edgey... Are you... and Ms. Oldbag...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">NO!</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">You really don't change, do you? When will you learn how to take a joke? Anyway, that Samurai Dog wasn't mine. Those things are a present from the studio to the Embassy.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">A present...?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">The studio big-wigs basically told us to play delivery boys. We were supposed to hand the Dogs off to the embassy people and tell them "hi". I had to pile them all into the pushcart just to move them all! Those studio guys should've delivered those things by themselves! Right, Edgey!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, did you deliver the Samurai Dogs to the embassy staff as per your instructions?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hey! Edgey! Don't just ignore me and my question! Aren't you going to stick up for me!?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Ah, about that. See, after the show, I went to rest a spell in the dressing room. Because of my bad hip, you know. And there they were, the Samurai Dogs were just sitting on the dressing room floor.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I suppose you had to make preparations for distributing them after the show.</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Well, if by preparation, you mean sampling them as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Excuse me?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Oh, I tried one and thought they were actually quite good! Sorry, but I just had to find out. I know it was silly of me to think this, but... ...I figured that since they're for a kid's show, their taste was probably for kids, too. But they were so good that I couldn't stop. Before I went back to my room, I just had to help myself to half a dozen or so boxes! As I sat there by the roaring fire, warming them and eating them, I thought, "Ah, this is..."</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">............</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">............</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Hmph. What is it now? Oh! I know! I bet you want a box, too, don't you, my Edgey-poo? Well, who am I to say no to you. But I'll only give you one. The rest are all for me.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Looks like the lesson for today is that when the Steel Samurai and the Pink Princess... ...take off their masks, they transform into a pair of annoying troublemakers.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you could please take a look at this brown-colored undershirt...</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Oh, Edgey-poo... What is the meaning of this!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Why did you steal that thing from my bags...? All you had to do was ask, and I would've gladly given you as many as you'd like!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnnrghk! Th-Thanks, but no thanks! This shirt was found here at this crime scene.</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Come now, why don't you just confess... and explain what it's doing here.</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">I know nothing! NOTHING, I tell you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Oh, I admit that I used the fireplace to dry that shirt! But I can't really help the fact that I had to, you know! Wearing that Pink Princess costume was like being in a sauna! And on top of that, I get fingered as a suspect!? You're too cruel, Edgey-poo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you claiming that you never once set foot inside this room?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Of course I am! If I had been the one to find the body, do you think I'd be as calm and relaxed as I am!? I tell you, it's always like this! It's always my fault for some reason or another. That weekly tabloid article is missing? The camera is missing? That lawyer always makes sure it's my fault they're missing. Speaking of missing, there's the matter of my husband. Can you believe when we got married, he said, "I guess I'm stuck marrying you." What kind of way to propose is that!? What he should've done is he should've whispered in my ear, "I don't deserve you... but I can't help it. Will you marry me?" Honestly, men these days!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm... Well... <thought>I don't believe she is lying about her actions... So I can safely assume she really was drying her shirt by the fireplace on her break. And somehow, the undershirt managed to move from the next room into this one (Undershirt from next door - The undershirt was found in the office fireplace, but how did it get there?</thought>...) I assume the Samurai Dog was also yours...?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Ah, that brilliant mind of yours. You really can see through everything about me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>And so the feeling of dread continues... But I suppose I should ask for more details...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Ooh, is it that valuable to you? This old lady's underwear!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th-That's not the reason I kept it! It's a very important piece of evidence...!</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">For you, Edgey-poo, I can spare an undershirt or two, you know. All you have to do is ask! Anytime, anywhere!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Arngh! If this wasn't a valuable piece of evidence, I would've disposed of it upon contact!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">This thing really showed me not to underestimate the taste of a snack meant for kids.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was it really that tasty?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">*gasp* Don't tell me you haven't had one yet! In that case, I'll just have to feed you one! Now, open wide! Here comes the hotdog train!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">N-No! That's perfectly alright! I'm currently on the job right now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It would appear that the answer has made itself known.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">You're making quite a confident face there, Mr. Prosecutor. Bring it on! I'm ready to counter any argument you may have!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well, then. If you are prepared... ...I'll show you exactly where my deductions have led me!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Good! I'm counting on you, Edgey!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Leave it to me, Larry. My first attack will be... to expose your lie for what it really is.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">M-My liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I know that there is still something you are keeping from the rest of us.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Wh-What's wrong with you!? Why is it you won't believe me no matter what I say, Edgey!? Curse you! I should just hurry up and die already if that's how it's gonna be! I'll confess to every murder in the whole world, and then kill myself... ...and throw everything into mass confuuuuuuuuusion!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh, you made some wonderful friends as a child, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, I only have one thing to say to you.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Even if you make that face at me, it's no use! A man who is ready to die is strong-willed, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, it doesn't matter what sort of harebrained trouble you've caused... ...I only ask that you do not lie to me. If you cause an innocent person to be judged unfairly because of some insipid lie... ...I will never forgive you!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">E...Edgey...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Although, allow me to say... ...that I consider you to be among the innocent in this case. And that I will draw the real killer out. You can trust me on this.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Alright. I... I... This time... This time, I'll tell you the whole truth, OK!? What happened, what didn't happen, the works!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Just what happened will do! Now then, if you would please testify as to what you did up on the roof tonight.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">After the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, I thought I just finished telling you to not lie anymore.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Umm......... But it's... kinda, ultra-embarrassing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what exactly is so ultra-embarrassing that you can't tell me!?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Edgey, man! I just said it was embarrassing, so of course I can't just blurt it out! So you're just gonna have to reason it ouuuuuuuuuuuuut of me!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">As your superior, I command you to hurry up and expose this man's lie!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have every intention to, for I'm not about to let us waste time on such a trifling matter.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">After the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You left the pushcart? Could you please clarify that statement for me?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Yeah. So the wheels on the pushcart got covered in dirt from the Rose Garden. It would've made a mess of the floor inside, so Ambassador Alba said to just leave it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Well, it WOULD be rather impolite to dirty another country's embassy.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">Come to think of it, I recall seeing the Pink Princess on my way into the Embassy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what was she doing?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Nothing in particular. Because she was being carried by some docs on a stretcher!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She must've been incapacitated by the pain of her bad hip that she suffered during the show.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">So, I came into the embassy, right? And then...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Then, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you shook hands with the ambassador of the Kingdom of Allebahst, did you...?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Yeah! Can you believe it!? I did something really cool for a change. ...But, honestly speaking, there's nothing interesting about shaking some guy's hand.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, there. Are you disrespecting another country in their very own embassy?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">As someone with roots in this country, I'm feeling nothing but incredible shame at this second.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agreed... I apologize for his inconsiderate words. Now, Larry, please continue.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Wh-What is with all of you!? You keep saying that kind of thing and I'll tell you only lies!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're already telling us nothing but lies! So let it go and move on!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Aaaaaaaalright, already! You don't need to glare at me like that, Edgeeeeeeey!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">After that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, I want you to listen very carefully and take this to heart. The whole point of your life is to cause misery and pain to everyone you encounter.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I-I knoooooooow! I get it! I'm totally the bad guy again!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I thought you're his friend. Don't you think that was a bit harsh? Lang Zi says: "True friends are bosom friends." If you are in trouble, call on your bosom friend, whose shoulder you can truly cry on.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hey! Bosom buddy! I hope you're listening carefully to my testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Has it crossed your pea-sized brain yet that Agent Lang is only out to arrest you, Larry?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Now then, you were wandering around inside the Embassy, and then what happened?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">That's when I spotted the chimney. A chimney like that is a rare thing, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I should hardly think that chimneys are that rare.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Agreed. Especially since they are a traditional feature of American houses.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Plus, many grand buildings have even larger and fancier chimneys.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Yeah, but the kind of chimney I'M talking about is the really romantic type!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A "romantic" chimney...?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">It might sound kinda silly... umm... but women seem to really enjoy them... And I just had a good feeling about that chimney!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">So then, I wanted to play Santa and decided to give it a try.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You... suddenly wanted to play Santa...?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Oh, well, actually, I dressed up as Santa once before already. That was down at Gourd Lake.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gnnrk! ...I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't dredge up such unnecessary memories for me!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh, sounds like you guys share a lot of history. A perk to being childhood friends, huh? Besides, it's not a felony to dress up and play Santa, you know. Santa doesn't go around killing people after he comes down a family's chimney, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Actually, is it worth delving into whether or not playing Santa is a big deal?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">So I guess you don't have a problem with my statement?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps... <thought>...I need to gather more information first.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As I suspected, you do have something to hide, Larry. But what could be so embarrassing that you'd be willing to go to jail for it!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">This man's mind is a complete mystery to me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe it's a secret to everyone of a normal mindset how Larry's mind works. However, taking into account his usual, women-obsessed way of thinking... ...I believe that his lie this time is also related to a woman, and this is what I intend to prove.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Actually, I believe in the case of this man, playing Santa is actually quite a big deal.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Are you saying that your buddy isn't exactly made of Santa-quality stuff?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. You hit the nail on the head, Agent Lang.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hey, Edgey! That's so incredibly mean!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Tell me something, Larry. Did you know that Santa's job is to deliver presents to people all over the world?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Of course I know that! I DID graduate from junior high, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, it's your turn to tell me something. I want you to tell me to whom you were delivering a present to.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Umm... I was, ah... delivering a present to a child not basking in the glow of love?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That must be the most elegant description of you I've ever heard, but a lie is still a lie.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Y-You sure know how to kick a guy when he's down, you know that!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In any case, the person you wished to deliver a present unto was most certainly this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right, it was this person!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">.........Edgey. Looks like you can say totally irrelevant things, too, just like meeee!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I refuse to be lectured by a man who bumbles through life like a punch-drunk monkey! <thought>Gnnrk... It would appear that I was mistaken... But if I think through this rationally and calmly, the answer should become clear. The person Larry wanted to deliver a present to... There really is only one person it could be!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh, interesting tastes you have there, Mr. Suspect.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">D-D-Don't speard lies about me! I totally didn't want to see Ms. Oldbag so much that I'd try to go down a chimney! Owww!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I advise you to stop right there in your bashing of a lady.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, I must admit that I, myself, hardly ever have the want to run into that lady. However... what if you were misinformed, and under the wrong impression? Then what?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Define "wrong impression".</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I simply mean that the man before you thought to enter the old lady's room... ...without knowing one very important fact. And that fact... is best summed up with this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, I'd like for you to take a look at this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">No way!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But--!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">It's not really all that important, is it!? It's always like this! You acting so high and mighty, and then you bully me! That's why... I refuse to look at it!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Be quiet and just take a look!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Well, if you say so, Franzy. But only because you say so!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Some people never change... Even if their attitudes do change at the whim of women.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">...So what's up with that anyway?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Why, it's proof that you never even knew existed, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Oh, is that all! Well, I don't need it right now, so I'll just give it back to you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Heh, I've got you on the ropes now, don't I?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Was that piece of evidence unrelated to the question at hand...? I need to think through this one more time. Larry didn't know one very important fact when he tried to sneak into the old bat's room.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is something the old lady received from her employer for the night. The girl who normally plays the Pink Princess... Mindy, was it again? It seems that this man is quite taken with that actress.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">But that's not true, Edgey!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">She's the one with the hots for me! I just know it! I can feel her sexy beam piercing my heart when she's watching me! Seeeeeexy beam, I tell you!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You filthy, despicable, inconsiderate, fickle, idiotic, cowardly... ...apparition of a man! You haven't matured at all since we last met!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Mr. Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">This guy... He's got bigger problems than just getting involved in murders, I take it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose you could put it that way.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hey! What the heck, man!? I don't get you guys at all! What do you all have to make me out to be some sort of bad guy!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">To return to the original topic, I propose that at least this much has been made clear. Without any knowledge that Ms. Mindy had fallen ill... ...Larry tried to make his way into the Pink Princess's room. That much we know for sure!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hey, Edgey... Looks like I've got the hang of this court thing now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But we're not in court at the moment...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Shut up! I see what's going on here, and it looks just like what you do in court!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I guess old boy here still has something he'd like to say. Lang Zi says: "Until the root of the tongue dries, one never knows the whole truth." You shouldn't form conclusions until everything is out in the open, which is why I'll listen.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Alright! Then get ready to listen to me defeat Edgey in a battle of wits!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Larry, have you forgotten that should I "lose", your victory prize will be your arrest?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">So you think all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..................</line>
<line speaker="Lang">..................</line>
<line speaker="Larry">..................Hey! Someone say something!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, are you seriously trying to submit this, not as a confession, but as testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">So what if I am!? Is there something wrong with that!? My claim is a claim claiming my claim. Do you have a problem with that!?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">So it was you! You're my stalker! But I should warn you, it doesn't matter what kind of flattery you throw at me. I'm the devoted type of woman who's wholly focused on one man, and one man only! And as long as Edgy-poo is alive, I can't just drop him and be unfaithful! No, I can't! Although, earlier, I was tempted just a tiny-winy bit by that wolf-man! But that was just a test of my love for my dear Edgy-poo, which I passed with flying colors! But from now on, I will stay completely true to my beloved Edgey-poo for the rest of eternity! I swear it!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Aaaaah! I-I'm so inspired!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You're such an inconsiderate, cowardly, idiotic, and all-around completely worthless man!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I thought I heard something ominous just now, but perhaps it was just my imagination.</thought> I believe there is nothing further for me to prove at this point...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">What do you mean!? Of course you've still got something to prove! You still have to show some proof that I was trying to meet up with Mindy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"Proof", you say?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Remember, Edgey!? Everything is evidence in court, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You mean, "Evidence is everything in court," Larry, but I understand your point.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Yeah, see! I'm totally a pro at this now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well. If you wish to see the evidence... ...then let me show you the last piece of evidence you'll ever wish to see.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">So you think all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, I have been saying that for a while now... After all, if not for that, then for what other reason did you wish to go down that chimney?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">You can't say that without any evidence! That's against the rules, Edgey!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh! Thanks for keeping the prosecutor in line for me, Mr. Suspect!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... I have the evidence. And if you wish to see it that badly, I can introduce you two.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Ah, but it's not good to keep them waiting, my subordinate. Hurry and show them already!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">L-Lies! All lies, Edgey!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, if YOU wish to lie, then by all means, continue. Because I'm ready to expose your lie at a moment's notice!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Arrrrnngh... Y-You won't get the better of me! Now, let's see...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Larry">Well, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was the smoke coming from the chimney really that thick?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">You bet! It was so thick, I had tears pouring out of my eyes! It was a mess!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">..................</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">..................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... I see. You do realize that you've just confirmed for us, your chimney escapade?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">What!? Th-That's totally unfair! Y-You tricked me, Edgeyyyyyy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hardly. You simply have yet to master how to counter this cross-examination technique.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">W-Well, what I just said was a slip of the... No, I mean, I said the wrong thing! Besides, isn't this what you really meant to say about what I did tonight?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">It was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm not quite sure how you could mistake that actress for this lady...</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Ooh, Edgey-poo! Are you staring at me? Ah, are you finally succumbing to my feminine charms?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I should think that the Steel Samurai is the one who should know all about your "charms".</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Whaaaaat!? M-Meeeee!? Edgey! What are you trying to do to me!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nothing! Simply that the Steel Samurai and the Pink Princess are husband and wife.</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">Aww, is my poor, little Edgey-poo jealous?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh! I-If you could please drop that line of discussion right this instant...!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">But Edgey! I... I told you! I already have Mindyyyy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Speaking of Mindy, exactly what kind of woman would you say she is?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Edgey, are you seriously telling me you don't know who THE Mindy is? She's just like what her name means! She's super sweet with a great smile! I don't mean to brag, but she's one of the troupe's fastest rising stars!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Interesting...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! So you're saying a woman like that is what made you late to the speech?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">...Huh? C-Curse you, too! Why is everyone out to make a suspect out of me!? Look, all I can say is this! I was late to the speech...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Then, to top it all of, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose you might be correct in a small way.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Wh-What do you mean by that!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Besides being a suspect in a murder, there are a few other things you are a suspect of.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Oooonngh... Not you, too, Franzy!</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">You tried to stalk me! But I won't let you intimidate me like that!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Look! I already told you, Ms. Oldbag! I wasn't after you, I was trying to see Mindy...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, can I just arrest this guy already?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........I completely understand how you feel, Agent Lang.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">W-Wait! Pleeeease listen to what I have to saaaaaaaay!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you have a serious assertion to make, then I'd consider listening, however...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">No problem! I'm gonna put all I've got into this, so listen good, OK!?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry... This is the final point you wish to make?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">You got it! I've called on all the energy I have and told it to you with all my soul!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, allow me to take that soul and break it.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Yes. We'll stamp it under our feet until it's been ground to a fine powder!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">A-A fine powder...!?</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">..................</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Eek!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">If you really put all your soul into that, then you're ready for what's coming, right?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I-In place of the honorable Larry, I offer my soul to you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Larry... Come out from behind there and face this like a man!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Y-You're scary, My Lieeeeeeege!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This whole testimony is one giant confession of all that he's done tonight. He's practically begging me to show why he bothered to put himself through all of this.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">H-H-H-H-H-Hey! Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Why are you showing that thing to me!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">"Wéndy, I'll be descending on you from above tonight. Your loving knight" Well, isn't that just romantic?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But you weren't able to "descend on her from above", were you... Mr. Loving Knight?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Aaaaaaaaaaaarghn! I-I have no idea what you're talking about! I don't remember a thing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You can pretend to be ignorant all you'd like, but it's written right here. This letter proves that you were not out to meet the old lady... ...but rather, that you were attempting to pay Ms. Mindy a visit! <thought>What part of this letter shows that the person Larry had intended to meet was Mindy?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... All will be answered if we simply look here!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Really? Because I'm not sure where I'm supposed to be looking, Edgey!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... <thought>My finger is apparently not as precise as I thought it to be.</thought> You leave me with no other choice. I shall have to point you to a spot that even you can easily comprehend.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, I suggest you take up penmanship lessons. That is... ...if you never wish to experience this level of embarrassment ever again.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Wh-Wh-Wh-What the heck!? What are you talking about!? Speak English!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You wrote "Mindy" so sloppily that it became "Wéndy" to the average eye.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">...Hey, stop picking on me... It's so embarrassiiiiiiiiiing!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">There, there. Isn't that what childhood friends are for? They're the best, aren't they? ...For punching. But that will have to wait until we're off of this crime scene.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Eek! Edgey! Save me from the scary man!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sure, if you're willing to make amends. Starting with your incredibly embarrassing mistake!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">.........That... That... That wasn't me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Come again?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">It's a fake! Someone's out to get me, so they made that fake letter... ...to set me uuuuuuuup!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Accept your defeat graciously!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">But... you guys are being so mean...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Penmanship analysis.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">What's that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No matter who, all people have certain unique features to their handwriting. Ergo, all we have to do is compare the handwriting in this letter to a sample of yours... ...and we'll know soon enough who it was that sent this letter.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I...I...I... I'll never write another thing in my life!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Tsk, tsk, tsk... It's no use, Mr. Loving Knight. For you've already graciously provided me with a sample of your handwriting</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You remember this, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Nope, But if you're giving it to me, I'll take it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As if I'd give this to you! <thought>Oops. wrong piece of evidence...</thought> Hmph... A-Anyway! I don't need you to write anything for me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The autograph and our mysterious letter... If we compare the handwriting, we'll know the answer to our questions soon enough.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Gnn...nnn... Nnnnnnnn...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Confess now, Larry... to your miserable failure!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I...I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorry! I... I... I did it... It was me causing trouble again... I admit it. You hit the nail right on the head... Edgey...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, he finally confesses...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">I saw the Pink Princess being carried around in a stretcher, and got worried, alright!? I wanted to go into Mindy's room, but the doctors wouldn't let me in. So what choice did I have!? It was the chimney or bust, Edgey!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Your mind jumped from the door to the chimney? What a criminally overactive imagination.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Well, at least I was honest and wrote Mindy a letter, and stuck it under the door. That way, she wouldn't be so shocked when I came down through the chimney!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Except for the fact that the letter was an utter failure at conveying said sentiment...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">I'm really, really sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, you may be a shameful, good-for-nothing blight on the face of humanity... ...however, I always knew you weren't the killer. I told you to trust me... ...because, at the very least, I can attest to that about you.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Edgey... You're... Aaaack!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">We've lost a lot of valuable time because of you...!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Owwwwwwwww!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">In any case, I believe we can say that we now know exactly what happened. Mr. Larry Butz sought to climb down the chimney... ...not for access to the crime scene... ...but to enter the room of the elderly lady next door.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Great job, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, I still find it a bit unbelievable that the two of you are friends.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..................</line>
<line speaker="Lang">But the suspicion on that guy over there... ...isn't completely resolved yet, so don't get any funny ideas about running off, OK?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Owwwww...w? H-Hey... What--? Edgey... What does the wolf-man mean when he says I'm not off the hook yet?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........He means the murder weapon. Larry, did you forget? There are two layers of suspicion hanging over your head.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That's exactly what I mean. We can't only rely on the words of the suspect, after all. We may have figured out where he was and what he was doing all night... ...but the blood-stained Samurai Sword that was left at the crime scene... As long as there is no satisfactory explanation for that... ...this wolf will refuse to ease up on his bite!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Eeeeeek! Edgey! That guy... He looks like he's seriously about to take a bite out of me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm well aware. And you should be as well, that this upcoming battle will be crucial.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Thanks to the cooperation of our lovely bumbler... ...I've been dealt a very nice hand, and a sweet trump card. Looks like we're about to enter the final bout! Now, Mr. Prosecutor! Let's see what you've got!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can easily point out the contradiction in the supposed "murder weapon"... ...but the real problem for me is figuring out what the real murder weapon is. This will be a high-stakes gamble! But this is one game I can't afford to lose!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Isn't it a bit far-fetched to accuse someone simply on the basis of ownership?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">But this owner wanted to sneak onto the crime scene. I think that's plenty to go on, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you're alluding to his reason for being by the chimney, we've already established that!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hold on there, Mr. Prosecutor. You two are long-time friends, right? Who's to say you didn't fabricate the evidence to give him an alibi?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........You're accusing me of fabricating evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You think I can believe anything you produce? Forging evidence is all you prosecutors do!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........! <thought>This man has some serious issues with prosecutors...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">But come on, I can't think up something as complicated as that! Right, Edgey?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, I can agree because I know you and your personality well. However, Agent Lang knows nothing about you... or me, for that matter. <thought>I sense his hatred for my entire profession emanating from his entire being. Meaning that the only way I can prove Larry's innocence is to present irrefutable evidence.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you were the first to discover the body this time...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">"This time"...? What's that supposed to mean!? You'd better watch what you say!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I only said "this time" because earlier, Kay was the first to discover the body in Babahl... ...and your secretary, Agent Shih-na, was ready to accuse her of murder for that.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! So are you going to use that excuse to call me "suspicious" now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course not; I was simply pointing out the usual pattern with discoverers of bodies!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">But in the Babahlese case, there was proof that she was holding the weapon, right? Well, in this one, it's a bit different, since we know exactly where the weapon is.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Excuse me, but "glittering red and offering up scent of blood"...?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Do I have to spell it out for you? I mean the sight and smell of blood, of course! And according to the tests, the blood on the sword belongs to the victim. The swords was made to only be used on stage, so it's not sharp. But it is pretty weighty. It's certainly heavy enough to beat someone to death with. Which leads me to suspect that the victim was beaten to death with the sword.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Beaten to death, huh? <thought>The last statement is too important to just let it slip by.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Change statement">"Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood." to</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Beside him was the Samurai Sword... covered in the victim's blood.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So the sword is covered in the victim's blood...?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah, the lab results confirm that the blood on the sword matches the victim's. But the sword is as dull as a vanilla envelope. It's just a stage prop, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">The Steel Samurai is all about "Safety First"! So you can't use it like a real sword!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Steel Samurai has spoken.</line>
<line speaker="Oldbag">..................</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The Pink Princess also appears to have something she'd like to petition to you personally.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Wh-What the Pink Princess would like to say can wait for the day after eternity!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Anyway, my point is that even though the sword is too dull to slice with... ...it's certainly heavy enough to bludgeon someone to death with. Therefore...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I suspect he beat the victim to death with that thing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">About this Samurai Sword... Have you received a report from forensics yet?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">They confirmed that the blood on the sword belongs to the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Alright, but have they confirmed that the outline of his wound is consistent with the weapon?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tell me something... Do you see the dead body right there in front of you? So! If they were conducting the autopsy right now, shouldn't that body not be here!? Well!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... I suppose so. <thought>I guess they must still be investigating this room. Meaning that it's possible he doesn't know about that piece of evidence's true nature.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Anything else you'd like to chit-chat about? No? Good. Now let's continue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Lang">It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry has already testified that he forgot the Samurai Sword here...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Yeah! I was shaking hands with the ambassador in here, and I left it behind by accident!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">So what? You lied earlier, so who's to say that this excuse isn't just another lie?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">But I forget stuff all the time! Right, Edgey!? Tell him!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Why don't you tell him yourself!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You see? What did I tell you earlier? No one will buy such a pathetically weak excuse.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, well... I know that it's not possible to prove such an excuse as truth...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">And yet you offer it up as fact!? You're a worse person than I originally thought.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You are free to think what you'd like, however, I know that Larry is not the killer. Agent Lang, please continue with your argument. I'll expose the flaw in it soon enough!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Just because he is the owner of the weapon, therefore he must be the killer, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">No. Climbing all the way up to the chimney is plenty suspicious in my book as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Regarding that, I have already drawn the truth out, and the truth is one thing I don't bend.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">It doesn't matter if it's you or whoever. You prosecutors are all the same. And as for me, prosecutors are the one thing I don't trust in!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">An agent who doesn't trust prosecutors? What are you playing at?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Sorry, sis. But there are only two things I trust: my subordinates and evidence at the crime scene.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Agent Lang hates prosecutors. But as long as he trusts evidence that has been at a crime scene... ...then there IS something I can show him that he can believe in!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">You can claim she's innocent, but you can't change the facts I've already outlined.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's simply not possible that the Samurai Sword is the real murder weapon. So I should focus on proving that point to Agent Lang first.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you know what this is, Agent Lang?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh, it's a long spear, right? We used to use those a lot in my country a long time ago. Piercing, mowing people down... Spears are the weapon of heroes throughout history.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It's the next most effective weapon after the whip.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I think the whip is in a slightly different category...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">So, what's your point? Are you going to tell me that the spear is the real murder weapon?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. I simply want you to take a look at this section here.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The way it's bent...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. Apparently, a certain troublemaker hit it against a wall in this embassy earlier. And as you can clearly see, the insides of the Steel Samurai's weapons are hollow. In other words, they're replicas that aren't strong enough to deliver a damaging blow... ...let alone the multiple strikes necessary to bludgeon someone to death. And yet, there is not even a dent in the Samurai Sword. How do you explain that!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">A...Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Oh, yeah... The sword and the spear are made of the same stuff, so they bend easily! But I wish they'd make them out of better stuff! Because the spear got bent... ...I wasn't able to do my special "Early Summer Rain Jab!" move! Man, I got such an earful from the director of the play for not doing it in the show!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The Steel Samurai's special move was changed tonight because of him...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Larry">Yeoooooooooowch!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That's more than enough of your whiny whimpering! Now... back on the topic of the spear.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, let's return to the real topic of discussion. <thought>This is where the real gamble begins. I don't have a real strategy, per se... ...so all I can do for now is let the chips fall where they may.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Using guesswork and taking risks in place of real logic is hardly the Von Karma way. It's neither smart nor very clever.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. von Karma, as you know, unlike your father, I am not a genius prosecutor. Plus, I doubt his record of a 40-year win streak will ever be broken.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">..................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But perhaps, it is for the best if it remains unbroken. For no one should've conceived of the notion to "convict all defendants" in the first place!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What a foolishly foolish statement from a foolish fool who hates to lose... It's the job of a prosecutor to make sure that all defendants are found guilty in court. There is nothing more important in this world than a perfect victory!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That may be your opinion, however, I don't believe that's all we are.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">.........!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As a prosecutor, what I pursue is not the perfect victory, but the perfect truth. And if that means that the bridge I must cross will crumble beneath my feet... ...then let it crumble as I walk on towards the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You're good at keeping me entertained, Mr. Prosecutor! But you know... humans are delicate creatures. The slightest bump and we expire. I'd like you to consider, if you will, the possibility that... ...the sword was used in such a way that the attack killed DeMasque II without bending it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..................</line>
<line speaker="Lang">So, what do you think of my hypothetical scenario? I think you know what to do here, right? And what you need!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course. <thought>What I need is evidence even Agent Lang can't refute! This is it! It's time to bring this to a close!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">It's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How long do you intend to cling onto that preposterous theory?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">As long as I want, because we examined every corner within the walls of this embassy. There's no stone we've left unturned! And we have managed to come up with only one logical conclusion! That the only place inside this embassy with the victim's blood on it is this sword.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You left no stone unturned? Is that a fact?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">If you've got something to say, then say it in the only way I respect, Mr. Prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, of course. In that case, allow me to make it all crystal clear for you!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">It's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">May I inquire as to how are you able to make such a claim, Agent Lang?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "Capable of miracles beyond comprehension, a mysterious creature is man."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Rather than man, it's Agent Lang's quotes that are getting increasingly incomprehensible.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">The human body is a mysterious thing. Even with a toy-like sword... ...it's easy to kill a man if you hit just the right spot. Which is why I think it's possible to kill with this thing without leaving a dent.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But we can only be sure one way or the other by seeing if the wound matches the sword!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hmph, I know that. But as long as it's a possibility, I can proclaim it as much as I'd like.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">And under these circumstances, it's the only logical conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But you must know that your conclusion is wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Given the circumstance I'm in, the only people I can trust are my subordinates. Because they're a much more trustworthy bunch than you prosecutors will ever be.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you call yourself a professional...!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You still don't see, do you, Mr. Prosecutor? You have to earn my trust. And the only way to do that is to show me proof of another possible murder weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Another possible weapon... In this room, there is only one other thing left... This is going to be a gamble, but I can't withdraw from the game now!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">You're not going to get me to trust you by the power of your glare alone, you know. Plus, I have other reasons as to why I think the Samurai Sword is the murder weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">We searched the Embassy, top to bottom, but the victim's blood is only on that weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The only place where you could find blood was on the Samurai Sword...?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That's right. Even with Luminol. Which means that there are no other possibilities outside of what I've already outlined.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Do I have a problem with Agent Lang's assertion that the Samurai Sword is the weapon?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... Perhaps I should wait and see how this plays out for a bit longer.</thought> Agent Lang, if you could be so kind as to continue with your testimony...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hrmph!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">So isn't it only natural that suspicion would fall onto the owner of said weapon?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what if you were to find a different murder weapon? Would that clear Larry's name?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Are you saying you can prove the possibility?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course. And if you don't believe that I can... ...then I'll show you something to convince you; evidence that you cannot refute!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">.........Hah! Ha ha ha ha ha! Sounds like fun, Mr. Prosecutor! Alright then, go ahead and show me what you've got!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I can prove to you... the possibility that the murder weapon is something else... ...but I cannot do so on my strength alone.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth. What are you running straight into a quagmire for? I thought you said that you were busy in pursuit of the perfect truth. And if that's the case, then show me this perfect truth, if it exists at all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't worry. Thanks to you, I've already prepared myself to do just that.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">There's no need to thank me. I'm simply doing what any good superior would.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... I suppose you are. Very well, then. I will show you the possibility of a different murder weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you believe that there is no other door of possibility left to open... ...then allow me to force one open for you!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hmph! And how do you plan to do that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By showing you what may possibly be the real murder weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Ha! Ha ha ha ha! The "real" murder weapon? I hate to repeat myself... ...but my men have already searched every last inch of this embassy! And they've concluded that nothing else could've been used as the weapon! Knowing these facts, do you still want to press forward with your little hypothesis?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course. Because it's not possible that your men inspected everything in their investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What are you talking about!? I don't appreciate mind games, and I don't appreciate it when people like you slander my men!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm not slandering them, I assure you! I'm merely pointing out that their investigative dragnet has a few holes in it! Namely, that there is something your men couldn't even lay a finger on. And that item is the real murder weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Aaaaaaaalright then! I'll play along for now! This "real" weapon that killed DeMasque II... What exactly is it!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The real murder weapon, which not a single person has yet to touch, is this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh, so you think it's the sword, too, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">E-Edgeeeeeeey! How can you not believe me!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-It's not that I don't! My finger merely selected the wrong piece by accident! <thought>Think, Miles! Isn't there something else that could be the murder weapon...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the weapon you're looking for.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "One should always perform one's job in the proper manner." And I can't see how it's proper to show me evidence so devoid of potential or relation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh! <thought>Was I mistaken...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! Now then, Mr. Prosecutor, I'm going to give you one more chance. But only one more, you get that!? Because that's all the playtime I've got!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Nngh... I must remain calm... and think through this carefully... The real weapon that killed DeMasque II... It has got to be that thing! I just know it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........The national treasure of Allebahst.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You mean the Primidux Statue?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, and as you know, only the ambassador and his secretariat may touch it. Which, I believe, means that neither you nor your men were able to examine it, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Ha... ha ha ha ha... You know very well that if we did that, there'd be an international incident... ...between the Kingdom of Allebahst and the Republic of Babahl. The two countries' precarious relationship teeters in the balance... ...over a stupid fight related to a sovereignty statue! But I'll be damned if I let something go unexamined!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, if you could take a look at this... The direction the statue is facing just before and after the crime are different...! And there is only one conclusion I can draw from that.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">..................</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Go look for Ambassador Alba, and get him to give us the OK to examine the statue.</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Shifu! You can't listen to this infidel's words! He is most definitely trying to trick you! Shifu, Please, let's be rational about this!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Grr! Lang Zi says: .........Just go already!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Y-Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Shifu...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah?</line>
<line speaker="MIB">I'm really sorry, sir, but I was unable to convince the ambassador. I was unable to obtain permission for us to examine the Primidux Statue.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Hmph. I see.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Wait...! But then, the investigation is at a standstill! Agent Lang! I will go and speak with the ambassador personally!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Save your breath. He may act all weak and frail, but that old man's one tough cookie. But I guess you've gotta be tough when you're representing a whole country, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What do you want? Let's just hurry up and examine the statue already.</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Wh--!? But Shifu! What about causing an international incident!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Quiet! I'll take the fall if I have to later!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, the hypothesis is mine, so if someone is to take the responsibility, let it be me!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Responsibility? If we're going to talk in such heavy terms, maybe I should let you. It'd be a real problem for my men if something were to happen to me. Alright then... Less talk and more investigating!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If we want to know the truth, we can't stop here! Action must be taken!</thought> Agent Lang, I'd like to run a Luminol chemiluminescence test on the statue.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">A Luminol test...? Ah, good thinking. If the statue is the murder weapon, then some of the victim's blood should be on it. Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! Let's get the forensics team in here!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh! Looks like you hit the jackpot, Mr. Prosecutor. I guess this means that this is the real weapon that killed DeMasque II.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed...!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">But I wouldn't celebrate yet if I were you. This doesn't let your friend off the hook. It doesn't prove that he didn't kill DeMasque II, so the charge remains!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...We are hardly done examining this statue, Agent Lang! Knowing that it IS the real weapon, I believe further examination is required.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah, you think so? OK then, knock yourself out!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... Upon closer inspection, he really does look a lot like the Steel Samurai.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hey, maybe that's why they chose him to be the goodwill ambassador?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I... actually can't discredit that hypothesis.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Or maybe, the people at this embassy just really, really like the Steel Samurai.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That's absolutely preposterous.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I don't think it's that unlikely. We mustn't go around denouncing people's opinions.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">And yet, look at how easily you discredited mine, not that I care why they chose him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">With his sword drawn and ready, there is a certain aura of valor around him.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "Those who hold a sword hold an equally strong will." It's said that the weapon one holds reflects the strength and will of one's character.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... I wonder if this was created as a show of the country's majesty?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Ooh, then what does Franzy's whip say about her character?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It says that I'm ready to exact punishment on those who would break the law.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Wh-Why are you glaring at me!? I thought you understood that I'm not the killer!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe in your case, she wishes to exact punishment before anything else happens.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a shield on his back. I wonder if that's supposed to mean that his back is covered?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "Those with a shield on their back deflect all enemies behind them." It means that he is ready for any blindside attacks that may come this way.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, there's no need to attack overly-complex meanings to such a simple thing.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! You didn't seem to get Lang Zi's saying, so I was just explaining it to you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The saying itself is what I was referring to when I said, "overly-complex", you know.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Nngh.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">And what do we have here? This dirty smudge... It looks like... a handprint? Heh heh heh heh... Haaa hahahahahahaha! What's a definitive bit of evidence like you doing under here!? Looks like we've got some fingerprints to analyze!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gnrk! <thought>Worst case scenario, these prints belong to Larry... But it looks like it's too late for me to do anything about that now...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey! Forensics guy! I want results on these fingerprints ASAP, you hear me!?</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">Agent Lang! I have the analysis results, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Good! And!?</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">Sir! About the prints we lifted from the bottom of the statue... Well, um... You know the victim of the murder in the Babahlese Embassy...? The prints belong to him, to Mr. Manny Coachen, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">But that's--! Wh-What's going on around here!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No... That's... impossible! <thought>Each Primidux Statue can only be handled by someone of that country. But by the very fact that Mr. Coachen's fingerprints are on this one... ...it leads me to only one conclusion...!</thought> This statue... is actually Babahl's Primidux Statue!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Impossible! It can't be...!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">A...! Aaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiya!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Larry never once set foot on Babahlese soil, so he was free to go... However... this new piece of information only served to confuse us even further. The ringleader of a smuggling operation was killed with an Allebahstian knife in Babahl... ...and DeMasque II was killed on Allebahstian soil with Babahl's national treasure... ...and the mystery of the Great Thief Yatagarasu, who visited both countries. The pieces were there, but I had yet to see the big picture they were to form.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I've left the DeMasque II investigation to Franziska and returned to Babahl. I suppose my first order of business should be to look into Babahl's statue...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgewoooorth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, Kay, what's the situation?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, it's great! Investigating is so much fun!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...In other words, they've made absolutely no progress.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">W-We weren't goofing off! Honest, sir! We've been investigating our hearts out!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well, then. Would you care to give me an update on your investigation?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...Ummmmm... Oh! We've had a really fun time, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I knew it. Zero progress...</thought> In any case, Detective Gumshoe...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You have permission to enter the Allebahstian Embassy, is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yup! As a local detective, I'm helping out with investigations on both sides, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Good. In that case, I can leave these... pieces of evidence with you. They belong to the lady under the Pink Princess's mask.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">The Pink Princess? What kind of lady was playing her, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The kind that was also playing the role of the Pink Badger yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ugh! Ooonnngh... Understood, sir... If I happen to run into her, I'll give them back to her. And if I don't... then I guess I'll unload them somewhere...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He doesn't seem all that enthused to go find her, but I can't blame him.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now then, I don't believe I'll be needing this anymore either.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaaat!? Are you really going to throw that autograph away!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, because that Steel Samurai was a fake.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wait, what? What do you mean by "fake"?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Now then, I believe it's time for a little housekeeping.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How is the investigation going in the Babahlese secretariat's office, Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... Well, even thought we found a few treasures, they've all been pretty much burnt to a crisp. A treasure is a terrible thing to waste.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A-Anyway, is there anything else I should know about?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm... Oh! That's right! You know what I found in that office? A wooden bear carving! It's sooooo cute! Can I have it? Huh? Can I?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, of course you can't! <thought>By the sound of things, it appears that there has been no progress in the investigation.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! This is a Prosecutor's Badge! This proves that you're a real prosecutor, right, Mr. Edgeworth!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... Precisely.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, I've got one too! Mine's the Yatagarasu's Badge!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But if you walk around with that on your scarf all the time... ...all you're doing is proclaiming to the world that you're a thief.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Like I said! The Yatagarasu is noble! And because I'm full of righteousness, there's no need for me to be all sneaky!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Even if you are honorable, a thief is a thief... right?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">There are two embassies in this one building, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, they used to be a single country so it's understandable.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So with them trying to make up, does it mean that they'll become a single country again? If they do, I hope they'll always be good friends, and never fight again.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Before that can happen, I believe we need to solve this case. Otherwise, nothing will come of these gestures, not even friendship.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This is...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your father, Byrne Faraday... He had planned to use this as evidence in that trial seven years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But he was killed by it when it was turned into a weapon, huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Curses...! I shouldn't have made her recall such a tragic event... How could I have been so careless!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So I guess these counterfeits were made with Babahlese ink. Come to think of it, I remember hearing on the news the other day... ...that the Republic of Zheng Fa, where these bills are coming from, is in an economic mess.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's common knowledge that money rules the hearts of men. And when that money turns out to be fake, all-encompassing confusion is the result.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hah! And that's when the Yatagarasu makes her stand! I'm going to use my Iron Fists of Justice on each and every counterfeiter! You'll see!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I appreciate your sense of justice, however... ...I would appreciate it if you wouldn't go running into the heart of any more raging fires.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Nngh... Yes, Mr. Edgeworth... I'll try...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's a box of Samurai Dogs, right? Ah, but see, I'm a Jammin' Ninja fan! So, while I would love to have one... I'm going to be strong and resist the urge!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well then, how about we slowly enjoy them after we crack this case?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">OK, fine, you twisted my arm! Let's indulge!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, about this piece of evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!? May I... really have it? Hmm... But you know, as the Yatagarasu, it'd be bad if I couldn't get this by myself!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sorry, but I have no intention of giving you this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, really? I guess I misunderstood!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I feel like I've had a very similar conversation with someone else before...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, do you detect the scent of treasure coming from this bush?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The scent of treasure? Not at all.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Argh! Mr. Edgeworth, you're totally not with it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm not "with it"...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No! And it's important for both thieves and prosecutors to be energetic!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps for a thief like you, but that level of energy is unbecoming of a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You really think so? That prosecutor we met at Gatewater Land seemed to be pretty active.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, he's not a prosecutor anymore. See how everything just naturally balances out?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... A ladder.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Actually, that's a step-ladder.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They're the exact same thing.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No way! From their structure up, they're totally different! But of course, from a thief's perspective, the best kind of ladder is the rope-ladder. A step-ladder is much too heavy to carry around, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>And from a prosecutor's perspective, any type of ladder is guilty... ...of being dangerous during an earthquake.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Bags full of cement powder are stacked up here. I suppose they're for the renovation.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, because I don't smell a drop of gold here, or any other treasure for that matter.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, the only scent you should detect in a place like this is the smell of sweat.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! That was a pretty good play on words there!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ack! Gummy! Don't randomly jump into one of our dialogues like that!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Were you eavesdropping on us, Detective Gumshoe...?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">No, it's not like that, sir...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It would appear that the stage is also scheduled to be renovated.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You know, I would love to perform on a stage like this. Something like "The Greatest Great Thief Show"!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I should think it would be a bad idea for a thief to show their fact to the world...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, you're not going back to Allebahst already, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, not yet. I still need to gather a bit more information first.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So how come so many traffic cones are red and white?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's because they're highly visible from a great distance.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, is that why!? So then, the reason you wear that wine-red suit is for visivility sake...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please don't compare me to a ragged, plastic traffic cone!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You look like you're enjoying yourself, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, I don't have much else that I enjoy as much as a good investigation, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So... what did you find out?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ah, well... Ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I take it he has found nothing of any particular use... as usual.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I got something really interesting from Ambassador Palaeno!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? And what is the something "interesting"?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">This, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow, that's so pretty! I'm so jealous! That's a real treasure here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why does the flame burn green, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">So apparently, if you burn the special "whitcrystal oil" that they only make in Babahl... ...it burns this green color, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Interesting. So it's a special property of the oil. <thought>I suppose this is a ploy to force people to visit Babahl should the oil run out...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, Gummy! What about these silhouettes?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">They stuck some cutouts on the outside of the lantern so it'd project the images.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh...? Silhouettes, huh? They are rather pretty, aren't they? ......... <thought>Wait, what am I doing? I was supposed to be asking for an update on the investigation.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, what's wrong, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's something I want you to investigate for me. Do you think you can do that much?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...Uh-huh... You got it, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, that's not fair! Why is Gummy getting to do all the fun stuff!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ah, well, that's because I'M Mr. Edgeworth's partner.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! I can't believe you took advantage of the confusion and stole my role as assistant!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I expect the two of you to get along and work together like professionals on this.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wow, those look really good, sir! Can I have one!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't you dare line your stomach with the evidence! <thought>Come to think of it... ...the dog Detective Gumshoe takes care of just up and ate a Samurai Dog earlier as well. Poor little dog, slowly coming to resemble his handler...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">That's a souvenir from Babahl; it's a silhouette lantern.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By the by, how much is it?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It was realy expensive, sir! About as expensive as my coat!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? I see. So it's about the average price of a cheap souvenir.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ouch, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a sign here warning passers-by to take precautions around this renovation site.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">They're really going all out, huh? There's construction going on everywhere.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe Ambassador Palaeno said it was to attract more tourists and visitors.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But what can they do with the new stuff they're building? Hey, what do you think they should do, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...How about transforming it into a courthouse?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, be serious!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...But I was being serious.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Ah, so you're back now, are you, Mr. Edgeworth? You must be tired. Here, with these, you can eat whatever you'd like.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And these are...?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Discount tickets for our cafeteria! They open tomorrow at 10 in the morning.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I appreciate the concern, however, these coupons do nothing for me right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This open-air stage... What function does it serve exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Well, normally, we use it for a variety of events. It's all to attract that extra bit of attention to Babahl. I heard that tonight, over in the Allebahst rose garden... ...Ambassador Alba was to give a speech. And you know what? Manny told me that I really should give a speech.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Coachen told you that?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Yes, he did. Which is why I thought I should give a speech of my own. But, unfortunately, I wasn't able to.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Because of the fire the Yatagarasu started?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, I'd like to ask you a little more about the Primidux Statues.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, I see! Well, let me ask you this! Did you know that Allebahst and Babahl used to be one country called Cohdopia?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I know that much about your history.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Well, the Primidux Statue belonged to the founders of Cohdopia. ...At least, that's how the story goes. It was bequeathed unto the king of Cohdopia as a symbol of the country's wealth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So it was meant as a symbol of sovereignty, and the right to rule, I take it...?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Yes, that's right! Which is why both countries are so adamant about their claim. "We hold the real statue, therefore, we hold the right to rule" is the reasoning. It's pretty petty when you think about it though, I suppose.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But if Allebahst and Babahl were to re-establish relations... ...shouldn't that put an end to the squabbling over the statue?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">...I have no reason to believe so. The Primidux Statue is even more important now as a key to diplomacy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I wonder if Ambassador Palaeno knows... ...about what has happened to the very important "key to diplomacy". Perhaps I should try showing hims this "key" and see what he has to say about it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, there's just one thing I'd like to ask you about.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Yes? Oh, and don't worry. You can ask me more than just one thing! How about two or three? In exchange, I expect you'll be coming to Babahl, yes?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th-Thank you, but just the one thing is all I require. Manny Coachen... I'd like to ask you about this man who was your secretary.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">! S-Sure. I'll tell you what I know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thank you for your cooperation, Ambassador.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">He was... well... If I had to put it in one word, he was an able man. If there was ever anything I needed as an ambassador, he was able to get it for me. To think that a man like that... ...had a hand in a smuggling ring right under my nose, going completely unnoticed... Actually, I suppose because he was an able man, I was unable to detect his dirty dealings.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... It sounds like Mr. Coachen had a very sharp mind.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Recently, Manny had been really busy. Since I became the Babahlese representative at the Country Unification Council... ...he's been working tirelessly to cover my work for me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sorry, but what is this "Country Unification Council"?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">...Oh, well you see, had tonight's events proceeded without a hitch... ...our two countries were to re-unify and become one again. But I guess with how things turned out, that dream won't be realized any time soon.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... I suppose not.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">So this key can become a knife? That's some trick!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This key was originally stolen from your embassy seven years ago...</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Yes, yes... My, this is fascinating.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Are you listening to me at all, Ambassador?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Wow, this is really, very fascinating!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He's so absorbed in playing with the key that my voice is failing to reach him...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">I can't believe that Babahlese ink was being used in such an evil scheme... And if people were to find out, that would really tarnish the global image of Babahl. Ah, this is really bad. Really, really bad. Ooh, Babahl's in a bind now... *sigh*</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......... <thought>It is just me or do his words not match his facial expressions?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, if you could please take a look at this for me.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">..................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Primidux Statue sitting in Allebahst right now actually belongs to Babahl.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">...So it would appear. I received a call from Ms. von Karma about this earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then you will understand why I wish to inspect Babahl's Primidux Statue immediately... ...because the statue currently in your country's possession...</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Yes, well, I've already inspected it myself. And it is definitely Allebahst's statue. I know because... it's the real statue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Then you're saying that Babahl's was a replica?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">I'm embarrassed to say it's true, even though I knew that someday it would be exposed. I received my orders from the leaders of Babahl... ...and I was to negotiate with Ambassador Alba at this event. I was to negotiate with him and fix the results of the evaluation tonight... ...to say that we could not determine which statue was the real one.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why are you telling me this?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Well, because you already figured it out. Our statue is just a hollow gold shell. Even if Babahl were to lose face, the re-unification of the country is what's important. I'm right in thinking that, aren't I? I'm not making a mistake, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you don't know yourself, then I won't pretend to know either.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">I never thought that by being betrayed by my own secretary... ...the real symbol of wealth would be given to me. Isn't it simply ironic?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Babahlese ink consists mostly of whitcrystal oil. When lit, the oil in the ink burns a bright yellow-green. It makes for a great science experiment. Here, give it a try with this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, well, I understand your enthusiasm, but, the amount you gave me earlier is enough.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">I see... That's too bad. In that case, why don't you have a few more of these coupons? I've got plenty!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I have plenty of those, too! <thought>Where is he conjuring those from?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">This bush looks like the perfect place to hide some sort of treasure, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Ah, but there is no treasure inside those things...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh... Too bad.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">But we do have a lot of treasures back in Babahl.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Sounds great! I'll be sure to pay you guys a visit sometime for a five-finger discount!</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Sure, sure. We welcome you anytime.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Are you sure you really want to invite a thief into your country with open arms?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">They're having a real time of it cleaning up after the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... I suppose we should stay out here and investigate the stage some more then.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Just looking at these scaffolds makes me want to climb them!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I recommend that you do not try. There was a fire burning here until not too long ago.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, but I think enough time has passed, so it should be alright! Thief Child says: "If there is a height to be scaled, then scale it you must."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Starting from "Thief Child", would you care to explain what you just said?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, where are you going? Are you heading back to Allebahst?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, but before I do, I suppose I should give you a summary of what's happened.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Oh, I see. So there's been a murder in both countries using an object from the other country...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's the gist of it. Babahl is just as strict as Allebahst... ...in their inspection of the people and things that enter their country. Meaning that somehow, both murder weapons were smuggled into the two countries. That's the only logical conclusion that can be drawn. Perhaps the key to the weapon smuggling is the person who traversed both countries...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You mean the fake Yatagarasu!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In one way or another, the Yatagarasu is connected... Of this I am sure! Now then, where was the Yatagarasu first spotted?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">I believe it was the rose garden on the Allebahstian side of the embassy. The garden is just on the other side of this boundary. It's where Ambassador Alba was to give a speech tonight. At least, that's where I heard the Yatagarasu had appeared.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, I believe it's vital that I investigate the rose garden posthaste.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wait, before you go... Take a look at this, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What... is it?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">My guess is that it's a guitar pick. I picked it up just now over there. Do you think it'll be of any use?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>There is a little water on it... but how did the water get on it? It doesn't look like there's anything it could get wet from around here...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I was thinking, they have concerts here at this open-air stage from time to time, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Alright, I'll find its owner later...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, yeah! There's one more thing... Mr. Edgeworth, would you be willing to hold onto this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What is this?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's Ms. Yew's perfume. It's the bottle that woman left behind and that I found seven years ago. I thought that one day, it'd be of some use in tracking her down... ...so I kept it safe all this time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thank you. I'd be honored to hold onto it for you.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This is one of Ms. Yew's possessions that I found seven years ago... I thought that maybe it'd be of some use one day, so I took really good care of it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thank you, Kay. I'll be sure to put it to good use. You'll see.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah! Now let's go catch that woman!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We will. However, Kay, you need to look before you leap. You tend to lose your cool when it comes to anything related to that woman.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'll be alright! I'm not exactly all that calm normally anyway!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I don't think that's something most people boast about, Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">May I enter the Allebahstian Embassy?</line>
<line speaker="Guard">If it's only you, then yes.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why won't you guys let ME in?</line>
<line speaker="Guard">Im just following the rules, madam, so I'd appreciate it if you would cooperate.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well then! I guess I have no choice but to climb over the wall from the Babahlese side...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, please don't run off and do any more dangerous things tonight!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It was just a joke, Mr. Edgeworth! A joke!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Don't tell that AFTER my heart skipped a beat...&#160;!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the national flag of Allebahst, and it features the country's flower crest. Comparing the knife to the crest, it's apparent the knife was extremely well crafted.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, every detail of the flower is there on the knife handle's flower. In my professional opinion, this knife is worth quite a bit of money!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, that's a very valuable piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I know that! You're going to use this to find and steal the truth, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose you could put it that way. Now then, let's continue investigating.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I can see the courtyard and the Allebahstian Embassy through this window.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's a really stately and pretty embassy, isn't it? Especially that chimney! Just looking at it makes me want to use it to sneak my way in! Kinda like how Santa does it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>..................!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, are you alright? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm beginning to think that you may have what it takes to become a royal troublemaker...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We saw the show just beyond these doors, but it's been quite a number of hours now...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, have I ever told you that you talk like an old fogey?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I was merely reminiscing! Is that such a crime!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a flat-panel, a VCR, and a row of Steel Samurai videos on this table.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aren't they worried that if they leave the tapes out on that table like that... ...the Yatagarasu will make off with them?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I honestly doubt the Yatagarasu would want to steal Steel Samurai video tapes.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah, but that's where you're wrong! The fake Yatagarasu may not want to steal them... ...but you never know with the real Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please stop eyeing the tapes with that look of want in your eyes, Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The Babahlese Embassy is just outside this window. It appears the renovations are going well.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey! I see Ambassador Palaeno out there!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He's carrying wood planks for the renovations himself. Very commendable.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">1, 2 , 3... 4! He's carrying four of them!? Wow! He may not look it, but I guess Ambassador Palaeno has got some real muscles!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps a bit of physical strength is required to be the ambassador of a country.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the national flag of Babahl, and it features the country's butterfly crest.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Using a butterfly as a national symbol makes Babahl just seem so cute! It goes along perfectly with Ambassador Palaeno's smiling face!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what about the flower of Allebahst?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, by the looks of Ambassador Alba... ...it almost seems like the poor flower needs to be watered...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I suppose an ambassador is the face of a country, but Kay is being too literal about it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Guard">Welcome back, Mr. Edgeworth. Please accept these, courtesy of Ambassador Palaeno. </line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th-That's alright.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, come on. You might as well take them since he was nice enough to offer!</line>
<line speaker="Guard">Thank you, and I hope you'll visit our embassy's cafeteria to redeem them.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>... It appears that Ambassador Palaeno isn't the only one adamantly handing these out.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A bariety of tools are laid out here. I assume they're for the renovation work.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, it's a wheelbarrel!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You mean a "wheelbarrow"?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But it makes so much more sense my way! Ancient people probably wheeled barrels, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I highly doubt that's where the word came from...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Just let me have one for once, OK!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think I'll be returning to the investigation in Allebahst now, but...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I know, I know. I'll go back to Babahl and do some more investigating here!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I see you're back, Miles Edgeworth. How are things in Babahl? Although, I can't really say I expect much from Scruffy and that girl.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The investigation into Manny Coachen's death hasn't really progressed any... ...however, the investigation into the Yatagarasu was.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Ah, yes, the Yatagarasu. Even now, I find it hard to believe. A person who can freely traverse between the two countries at will? Preposterous.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, that's what I came here to investigate. I heard that this is where witnesses claim to have seen the Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That's correct. Ambassador Alba was to give a speech tonight here in Allebahst. And that's when the Yatagarasu appeared. The shadow of mysterious thief appeared, and just as suddenly, it vanished... After that, there was the fire at the Babahlese Embassy that the Yatagarasu started.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I vow that not a single feather from the Yatagarasu shall escape my diligence!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Tonight, in this very rose garden, the Allebahstian ambassador, Quercus Alba... ...was to give a commemorative speech. A very key commemorative speech at that. And including Agent Lang, the security detail was very tight. But, as if to mock our efforts, the Yatagarasu appears. Then, just like that, the thief vanishes and starts a fire at the Babahlese Embassy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Interesting... And are you sure it was the Yatagarasu who appeared here?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Of course. But to have slipped by such tight security... ...and then disappear into thin air... We will need to conduct a very thorough investigation of this area.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, my thoughts exactly. <thought>In order to find out the truth behind what happened here... ...I should start by gathering as much information as I can.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These are some beautiful roses here. They appear to be well-maintained.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You're being too nice, Miles Edgeworth. The arrangement is devoid of any design sense. Roses only truly shine when they are grouped by color; one color per location. They lose their beauty when they're all mixed together like this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can't tell if she's being sarcastic or not...  On second thought, there's a rather serious look on her face. I'd better leave it be.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">They should really re-think the proper balance of these roses.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Of all the people to comment on the "proper balance" of things...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is an overturned spotlight here.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">When the Yatagarasu appeared... ...the audience that was waiting for the speech to start panicked. I suppose that's when someone must've knocked it over.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I'm having a tough time visualizing the mass confusion that took place here...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I thought to use my whip to capture the Yatagarasu... ...however, there were people in my way, and I was unable to land even a single lash.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I suppose this means that some other poor saps were hit instead?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How is the investigation proceeding on your end...?</line>
<line speaker="MIB">...Lang Zi says... .........That's top secret.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">If you're going to attempt to imitate your superior, at least do it well!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't suppose he believes in the accidental leakage of information...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Have you finished checking out all the bystanders?</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Yes, sir! And we found... ...14 counts of pickpocketing, 16 counts of illegal parking, and one person ran a light, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Don't tell me you didn't find out anything related to the case...</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Sir! Not a single thing, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Well, for now, let's just get those other lawbreakers down to the precinct.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......... Agent Lang.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Well, if it isn't Mr. Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I would just like to thank you for your assistance earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Make no mistake. It's not like I was trying to help you with what I did.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......... After I left, did you receive word from Ambassador Alba?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">We're to wrap up our bodyguard assignment at the end of today. Oddly enough, we received word from HQ to return home on an urgent matter. Heh, as if I can be so easily called away from this case after I've come this far. I swear that I'll find the truth, and drag it out screaming into the light. You're with me on that, right, Mr. Prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You were working as Ambassador Alba's bodyguard at the time... ...so naturally, you witnessed when the Yatagarasu appeared, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah, I saw the thief alright. With my own two eyes. The Yatagarasu was always there, lurking in the shadows. But when the spotlights were turned on for Ambassador Alba's speech... ...a shadow appeared. That's when cries of, "It's the Yatagarasu!" rang out. The next second, the spotlight went out... ...and by the time we got the area lit again, the deft thief had vanished. When we investigated afterwards, we found that the reason the lights went out... ...was because someone had unplugged the extension plug for all the outdoor electronics. Whether it was someone doing it on purpose... ...or simply a guest who had tripped over it, we don't know. But one thing is for certain. The Yatagarasu was here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you're saying that, basically, all you saw was the thief's silhouette?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">If all you saw was a shadow... ...then it's entirely possible that the shadow belonged to someone else.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! Good thinking, sis. You just might be right. If it weren't for the fact that there was no one else with that same shape. Not among the staff or the audience members. My men have already done a thorough check of everyone, so I know I'm right!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Someone else's shadow...? That sounds like a plausible hypothesis...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "There is no value in trusting those who bear this mark." Let me fill you in on what I hate the most in this world. People who go around showing off that Badge! Sorry, but that's one opinion I'm never going to budge on.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "Inevitably, all who have evil in their hearts find themselves in Hell." But we haven't found all the pieces of the truth yet. I've come too far to go home before I see it all with my own two eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, our goals are the same, so shouldn't we be cooperating with each other?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch. We're on two different pages, you and I. And I don't trust any living thing that calls itself a prosecutor, got it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, about this piece of evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That thing stinks to high heaven!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Excuse me?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Like all wolves, I've got a good sense of smell. And there's one nasty funk coming from that document. It's the smell of some dirty scoundrels' greed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I wouldn't mind having his sense of smell if it helps in investigations this much.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">It's covered in blood. The sight of blood... brings out my wild side. What about you? Any special reaction to blood?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, not especially.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch. This is why you prosecutors are all worthless.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>How does that have any bearing on how good or bad of a prosecutor someone is...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, I'd like for you to take a look at this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">If we follow the trail that this piece leads us down, we'll eventually get to the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, then why don't we cooperate and help one another?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">No can do. I can't just trust someone working as a prosecutor that easily.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, what do you think about this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">He may be the second, but he's just a peon imitating someone else. Just look at what happened to him, all because he was out for the national treasure. Lang Zi says: "One should always know one's place in life."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I guess Lang Zi had a lot to say in life, and on a lot of mundane topics as well...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, I'd like to ask your opinion on this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Are you joking? You're asking for MY opinion!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Our mutual goal is to search for the truth, in which case, wouldn't cooperation be best?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "Only cooperate with those you can trust." Sorry, but I'm not one to place my trust in you prosecutor scum so easily.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I'll take that as a "no".</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? This statue bears a resemblance to the Primidux Statue.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The plaque says, "King Primidux and the Battlefield". "In order to save the queen, King Primidux put his life on the line and went to war."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So "Primidux" was actually a person of royal blood? I thought he was simply someone imitating a character from an ancient legend...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Well, what surprises me is that a real person who looked like the Steel Samurai existed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I suppose there's that, too.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose Ambassador Alba sat in this chair?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Ambassador Alba... is very elderly. The chair was prepared for him should he have gotten tired during his speech.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, why didn't he plan to make his speech sitting down in the first place?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...The ambassador is also quite prideful, that's why.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He sounds like my old principal from grade school who'd speak at assemblies.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So this is where Ambassador Alba was to give his speech.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The stage was set up nicely, however, where was the audience supposed to sit?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... Perhaps they were supposed to sit around the edge of the pool?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That's such poor planning, if there was no place other than a spot or two by the pool. They really should've made seating arrangements, like how the gallery is set up in court.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. You can sense that consideration for the viewers was taken with those.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">So in the end, the speaker and his audience were to stand the whole time, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... Although, I suspect the audience would've liked to sit down after a while.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There are roses scattered on the surface of the water, creating a pleasant fragrance.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It's not just for aesthetics; this pool's water is also used in putting out fires.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see... Oh! The pool stopped filling itself automatically.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The fountain spouts are set to stay open until the pool's water reaches a certain level.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If this water is used to put out fires, I suppose it must be refilled to its normal level. <thought>Which suggests that this pool was recently used somehow in this embassy... I guess I'll take some notes about it, just in case.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">N...Nnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">U...Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">How dare you surprise me like that!?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I-I'm sorry... Oh, hey, Edgey! Thanks for what you did back there!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your gratitude alone is enough. More importantly, Larry... this pool is not for your personal enjoyment!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I know that! Do you really think that I'm the type to just jump into a pool and swim around for fun!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.................. Alright then. Did you, by chance, fall into the pool?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Nice guess... but no dice. So you know my son, right, Edgey?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your son...?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I guess I kinda lost sight of him when I shook hands with the ambassador. And I'm pretty sure he was around here when I last saw hiiiiiiiiiim!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Y-You imbecile! How can you be so flippant at a time like this!? What are you going to do if your son fell into the pool!? And how old is this child of yours, anyway!?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Huh? Oh, umm... How old is he again?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, this is the first I've heard of a son. Who exactly is the mother?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">The mother? Oh, that chick... the Pink Princess!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The... Pink... Princess...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Ms. von Karma. I was a bit confused by this man's words for a bit there... ...however, I believe what he is looking for is the doll of the Iron Infant.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Yup! Because I'm the Steel Samurai through and through. Heart and soul! And the Iron Infant is my cute little son!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Y-You have given a whole new meaning to the phrase "an astounding fool"...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry. We have not seen hide nor hair of the Iron Infant. But rest assured that if we should find him, we'll let you know. Now, get out of there.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Sounds good! In that case, I'll go search over there!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hey! Wait! <thought>.........*sigh* Well, it's not as if he'll get very far swimming around in that pool... And thought he's unrelated to the murders, he sure knows how to cause a lot of trouble.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It would appear that this pool served its function tonight as an emergency water reservoir. The pool even refills itself to the present water level. ...And when the planets align, a Steel Samurai appears from its depths.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... A statue of a woman. I wonder if the lady is pouring water...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It says that it's a statue of "The Queen Who Spoke of Love to King Primidux". Hmph... Well, Miles Edgeworth. It seems that you are lousy at reading a woman's heart!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I open my mouth about a statue and she somehow made the leap to that...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is it possible that the Yatagarasu hid in these bushes...?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Of course not! They're rose bushes! You've been spending so much time with Scruffy and that girl, they're rubbing off on you. But it's alright. I'll wake you out of your stupor. Now, the next time you feel like sleep-talking, remember that I'll whip you for real.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>All I tried to do was offer up a possibility, and this is what I get...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The suddenly appearing and disappearing shadow of the Yatagarasu... I believe I've figured out its true origin.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I expected no less from my subordinate. Now, let's hear what you know on the subject. What really cast the shadow of the Yatagarasu?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska, if you could take a look at this. Don't you find it to be a bit suspicious?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Not at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.............................. Hmph... As I thought. For you see, I was merely testing you just now.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">We have no time to waste on your pompous talk, so get on with your explanation already!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nghhooooh! <thought>Gnrk... I guess Franziska just couldn't understand my point. I need to think this through again. Now, the Yatagarasu's shadow... There really is only one thing that can explain how it was cast, and it must be this!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The suddenly appearing and disappearing shadow of the Yatagarasu... Is it not possible that it was created by this statue?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Are you playing me for a fool, Miles Edgeworth!? This statue bears absolutely no resemblance to the shadow of the Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You are correct, however, this statue is but one part of the whole picture.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What do you mean by "only one part"...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What is the other part to the real form of the Yatagarasu's shadow?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska, if you could take a look at this. Don't you find it to be a bit suspicious?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Not at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.............................. Hmph... As I thought. For you see, I was merely testing you just now.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">We have no time to waste on your pompous talk, so get on with your explanation already!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nghhooooh! <thought>Gnrk... I guess Franziska just couldn't understand my point. I need to think this through again. Now, the Yatagarasu's shadow... There really is only one thing that can explain how it was cast, and it must be this!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It's... another statue?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Yatagrasu's shadow was made from the shadows of these two statues.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Made? What do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right now, the spotlights are all over the place. This is because they were moved when the guests were in a panicked state. However, if we were to restore the lights to where they were when the thief appeared...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You believe that the two shadows will create the Yatagarasu's shadow?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. Now then, watch as I reveal the true form of the Yatagarasu! First, if we set up a spotlight to cast a shadow of "King Primidux and the Battlefield"... ...the shadow of the king's statue would appear on the backdrop of the stage. Likewise, if we set a light up on "The Queen Who Spoke of Love To King Primidux"... ...her silhouette would also appear on the backdrop to the stage.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Aha! So if we were to combine the two shadows...!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">............ It looks nothing like the Yatagarasu's shadow! Miles Edgeworth! How do you explain this grotesque shape!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">C-Calm down, Franziska! The way the light needs to be shone on the queen's statue is wrong...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe that the whole of the king's shadow needs to be used for this to work. However, in the case of the queen, I don't believe her whole shadow is needed. Rather, the person who created the shadow only used part of her shadow.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Only one part?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, and that one part alone is enough to fill in the rest of the Yatagarasu's shadow.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Why didn't you say that in the first place!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're right. I-I apologize...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Now, what part of the queen's statue was used to complete the Yatagarasu's shadow?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This... is that part!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">And how exactly should we shine the light on this part to complete the shadow? Because I can't see how this would fit in at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Nngh......... Alright, perhaps I was wrong.</thought> Franziska, it's not there we should be shining a light on, but a different location.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth! Why are you withholding the correct information from me!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh! P-Please forgive my transgression...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Very well. Just don't mess up again!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Think back to what is missing in our shadow. Five long, thin areas, correct? Now, what does that remind you of?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right. It can only be the shadow of the queen's left hand. Franziska, can we please adjust the spotlight's position... ...so that it only shines on the queen's left hand?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Alright. Let's give it a try and see what we get.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">It's...!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hmph... Yeah, this is exactly like the shadow I saw.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The culprit must've changed the spotlights' positioning beforehand... ...and then pulled the plug after people saw what the culprit wanted them to see. In their panic, the guests must have moved the spotlights around... ...which we can assume was also a part of the culprit's plan. By the time the lights came back on, the Yatagarasu's shadow had vanished.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Which means that the shadow was a construct from the very beginning.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you see, the Yatagarasu never did visit Allebahst tonight. The only country that thief visited was Babahl, although it can be assumed... ...that the Yatagarasu had an accomplice in Allebahst.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">An accomplice? But who...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I haven't figured that out yet, but I assume it was the person who set up the shadow show. <thought>I sense that the biggest clue yet to solving this case is the existence of this accomplice!</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">.........How's the investigation going?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Badd, have you come to join us in investigating Yatagarasu?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">I've left the murder... in Agent Lang's charge... And my only target... from the very beginning is the Yatagarasu... so yes...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So... what have you found out?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...I got a piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">May I see it...?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Sure, but you might regret it...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">We're here because we are ready to face whatever may come. ...So if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...When people heard the commotion, bystanders... started gathering. And one woman... claimed, "I'm tellin' ya I'm a genuine international journalist!"... She gave me... an interesting picture.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A journalist...?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Well, actually... she's a freelance... cameraman. This... is the photo I got from her.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-What in the world!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The Yatagarasu... is flying through the air...!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...The times, they are a-changing... It's... not just man... ...but evidence... even they lie to us now...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-When was this photo taken?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Apparently, right after the fires... on the fourth and fifth floors were put out... It was taken... from a near-by building... that you can see the embassy from.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. So this was taken after the fire...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">The blur in this picture... took off from the Babahlese Embassy... ...flew over the boundary... and headed for the Embassy of Allebahst...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">This is simply not possible! People are incapable of flight!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that a fact? I've had the "pleasure" of dealing with a case involving a "flying person" once.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">.............................. Actually, come to think of it, I've come across a case like that as well. Two, actually.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Maybe it happens more often than we think...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Am I up to the task of solving the mystery behind this photograph? Well, the Yatagarasu took off from the Babahlese Embassy, so I should start from there.</thought> Franziska, I need to return to the Babahl investigation for a bit.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Alright.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I wonder what that photo earlier was all about...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed... <thought>That photo certainly was "interesting"...</thought> I believe this necessitates a need to investigate the Babahlese Embassy some more.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I suppose we have no choice if we are to conduct the perfect investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose so. <thought>I will have to pass through the Theatrum Neutralis to reach the Babahlese Embassy.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">This is simply not possible! People are incapable of flight!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, I had the "pleasure" of dealing with a case involving a "flying person" once.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Actually, come to think of it, I've come across a case like that as well. Two, actually.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Hah! What a farce. Turns out that what I thought was the Yatagarasu's shadow was some statues' instead.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's nothing to be embarrassed about. Everyone was in a panic.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...And here I thought you'd come over to throw some sarcastic remark in my face.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course not. You and I, we're both of one mind in pursuit of the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hmph... But are we really of one mind though...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'll be returning to the Babahl investigation now. I'll contact you if I find anything.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">.........You sure are as stubborn as a rock.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...So the Yatagarasu was just a shadow...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The calling card that was sent is what threw everyone off and made them assume things.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's possible that all of the events tonight were part of the overall plan.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">I'm... going to continue investigating on the Allebahstian side... You two... As I always say... don't do anything stupid, alright...?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I wonder if he's alright? It's unusual for him to be so nice.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think it's simply that he is concerned for our well-being, Franziska.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I'll continue investigating on this side of the building.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Alright, I'm counting on you.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Welcome back, Mr. Edgeworth! Now come on! Let's get vack to our investigation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, let's.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Is there really any place left we haven't checked out yet in the Babahlese Embassy?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Interpol was conducting its investigation when you were being held by Agent Shih-na. Because of that, I was unable to examine the fireplace and the secretariat's desk.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">True... And since he's here, we should talk with Ambassador Palaeno some more, too! He looks so sad and lonely since Mr. Coachen died...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, he does... and you are correct. I have a few issues I still need to discuss with him. We should make the best of this opportunity.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">......... I've only got one thing to say to this. The real Yatagarasu can't fly through the air!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I see you're back. Well, let's continue with the investigation, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, let's.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Bags full of cement powder are stacked up here. I suppose they're for the renovation.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, because I don't smell a drop of gold here, or any other treasure for that matter.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, the only scent you should detect in a place like this is the smell of sweat.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The smell of sweat? That's Gummy's coat, isn't it!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think you might be mistaken... Besides, that was a bit rude, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Was not! I was trying to say that Gummy is a really hard worker! The fact that you took my sentence completely the wrong way makes you rude!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M-Me, rude? Perish the thought.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This bush looks like the perfect place to hide some sort of treasure, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If treasure could be found so easily, wouldn't everyone be able to live life a bit easier?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww... Don't dash my dreams. ...Ah!!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-What is it!? Don't tell me you actually found something...!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whoops, false alarm.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Argh! How could I have let myself get caught up in her wild delusions...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">To think, after all that running around, we're right back where we started.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It would appear that way...</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Hi, Mr. Edgeworth. Have you found Manny's killer yet?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm terribly sorry, Ambassador Palaeno, but I have yet to find his killer. Then I guess his murder... really was the work of the Yatagarasu...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's get one thing straight. It was the work of the FAKE Yatagarasu. The real Yatagarasu is a noble vigilante who is only out to steal the truth...</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Ms. Faraday... Please don't make such a sad face. If there's anything I can do for you, all you have to do is ask, alright?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Palaeno...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Actually, there is one thing you can do. Will you allow us to take another look around? We didn't have enough time to conduct a thorough investigation earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, sure! Please feel free to investigate to your heart's content.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Also, there are a few questions I'd like to ask you personally, Ambassador.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">If it will bring a smile back to Ms. Faraday's face, then I'll gladly answer anything.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Thank you, Mr. Palaeno! You're a total gentleman!</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Ha ha ha. You don't have to waste such nice words on me, little miss!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, Sir Palaeno!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Those two sure got chummy awfully quickly.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">You know, it's easy to say we're going to investigate, but where should we begin?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We should probably start by comparing the state of this room before and after the fire. And then, we should look into the matter of the suspicious person you spotted.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah. When I came into this room, that person was already gone. But I'm willing to bet that person I was chasing is Mr. Coachen's killer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We don't know that yet; however, it's hard to believe that person is unrelated. Furthermore, because the key the Yatagarasu stole seven years ago was found here... ...it signals that perhaps Ms. Yew is also somehow involved.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I knew it! That woman is almost definitely Mr. Coachen's killer!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yet again, we don't know that! <thought>There are too many mysteries to be solved in this case.</thought> Speaking of the Yatagarasu and mysteries... ...I received a most mysterious photo from Detective Badd.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Uncle Badd!? He's taking part in the investigation, too!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. He has been chasing after the Yatagarasu for all these years.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Uncle Badd.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now then, I was told that this photo was taken just after the fire...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wh-What--!? This kinda looks like the person in the long coat I was chasing...! Does this mean... that I was chasing the fake Yatagarasu after all?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't know the answer to your question, but I don't think people can fly either...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But this could be how that person escaped!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, we'll need to investigate a bit more before we can say anything about that. In any case, let's not dawdle any more and pick up our investigation where we left off.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You can see the Allebahstian Embassy through this window.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So where were you when you were investigating over there, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... Ah, you can see it from here. I was there on the fifth floor. That's where DeMasque II was killed.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What!? You don't mean THE Mask☆DeMasque II!? Aww... Poor guy. As a fellow second-generation thief, I can't just turn a blind eye to this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Even though DeMasque II was merely an imposter of the original?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears that this area was heavily damaged by the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah. I guess we should hurry up and get started examining everything.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That looks like a very comfortable chair.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, it doesn't look all that broken, so why don't you try sitting on it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, I'd better not. It's very important that we preserve the crime scene at all times.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wait, but you're always touching all sorts of things at crime scenes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's because I am a prosecutor, and it's a part of my job to examine things.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And my job is to be a Great Thief!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Which is exactly why you are not allowed to touch anything.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So I guess embassy phones are just like normal phones, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, what did you imagine them to look like?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I thought that Babahl's would look like a flower, and the receiver would be a butterfly! That way, it'd look like the butterfly receiver was sucking nectar from the flower base!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If any country had a flower phone, it would be Allebahst, don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! Then maybe the phone I envisioned would've been from when they were Cohdopia?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's really no point in asking me about something that never existed in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmph! You know what you lack, Mr. Edgeworth? Curiosity and an imagination!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a bottle of Babahlese ink on Mr. Coachen's desk.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And it looks like there's still a lot of ink left inside.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The seal is unbroken, so the fire probably couldn't get into the bottle to burn up the ink.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, Mr. Palaeno! It looks like your precious Babahlese ink is alright after all!</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">What!? ...That's odd.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador, what do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Umm, well, it's just that there is something strange about the ink.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Would you mind elaborating on that statement for me please?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's Mr. Coachen's bottle of Babahlese ink. There's quite a bit of it left. I suppose he was the type to use the ink in both a legal and an illegal capacity.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It looks like... a bunch of flyers with coupons attached to them.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Babahl sure gives away a lot of different coupons! Maybe I should create one of my own! I could call it the "Great Thief Coupon"!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what kind of discount would that net you?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The five-finger kind, what else? And I'd steal an extra thing or two for the bearer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Things such as?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Such as the truth! What else would I steal?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What I wouldn't give to have a mountain of your coupons right about now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is only one book left standing here... "Treasures of the World"...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wait, what!? Let me see that! .........Un-huh... I see... Aaah! The most important part was blackened by the fire! Why, cruel fate... why?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It looks like the map of where the treasures are located has been burnt.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"Manny Coachen"... His name is written here on this nameplate.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why would you put a nameplate with your name on it in your own office?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose it's to inform people in case they walked into the wrong room by mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Do you think maybe it's also there to remind you of your own name if you forget?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, either way, it's never a bad thing to sit a nameplate on one's desk.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It would appear that this desk also fell victim to the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But it doesn't look too damaged... Ooh, I think we can riffle through this drawer a bit!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... I suppose we really should take a look.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems that the contents of this drawer survived the fire rather well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Now THAT'S a sturdy desk! I guess that's the value of solid wood construction. Let's see if there's anything useful left in here, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is a rather unusual shape for a notepad. I suppose this must be another souvenir from somewhere.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It would appear that this piece of evidence is related.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">To what exactly...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Alright, so perhaps it wasn't related after all.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, wait! Don't tell me...! Is it something that thieves can't see...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Why don't we say that's it, and move on?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I was just joking you know, Mr. Edgeworth! It's just my way of saying that when you make a mistake, you should just admit to it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh! <thought>It appears that she noticed after all... I really should carefully re-examine this area for clues.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The shape of this notepad... matches the shape of this note we found.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, you're right! What is it? It looks like something straight out of Monument Valley!</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Ah, yes, that notepad is a souvenir from somewhere in your country. We've been collecting them for the purpose of studying them, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I do. You do seem to be quite passionate about it...</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, would you like to see MY souvenir collection? I'd love to show it to you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Are you sure they haven't been burnt to a crisp by the fires...?</thought> Ambassador Palaeno, I wonder if you might recognize the handwriting on this note?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Hmm... This... looks like Manny's handwriting.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. In that case...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ooh, did you figure something out?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This note was found in Allebahst... ...specifically, it was found being firmly grasped by the murdered DeMasque II!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">DeMasque II!? Then this note...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, it was a request from Mr. Coachen for DeMasque II to steal the Primidux Statue.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">What!? Manny... tried to steal Allebahst's Primidux Statue?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We would know for sure if we could run a handwriting analysis. Ambassador! Do you have any documents that were handwritten by Mr. Coachen?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Y-Yes, I can gather a few and give them to you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I'll have to ask Detective Gumshoe later to run the analysis.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">I can't believe that Manny... would even think of doing something like this...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you have any idea as to why he would've requested the theft of the statue?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">...There is one possibility, but mind you, it's just my personal speculation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Anything you can tell me would be of great help, Ambassador.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A fireplace, huh...? So Babahl's offices have them, too.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">"Too"...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a fireplace in relatively the same location in the Allebahstian office. However, we found something there that I'd rahter not recall ever again. <thought>I still can't believe that we found that lady's undershirt in the fireplace.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">...? If it was that traumatizing, why don't you try creating new memories with this fireplace? You could climb inside, and we can play hide and seek!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...And come out covered in soot? I think not.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Argh! You really have no sense of fun, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This safe wasn't open at the time of the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You could tell because the inside wasn't burnt, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, and thanks to this safe's fire resistance, the smuggling evidence was preserved.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aren't safes great!? They always hold the wonderful promise of treasures within!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Well, this one certainly did have a few inside...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It appears that Mr. Coachen's body has been taken in for an autopsy. The white outline is all that is left to tell the tale of his murder.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, what exactly used to be here?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">That used to be a stack of brand-new pamphlets. But it looks like they were all burned up. I guess we'll just have to reprint them. But no matter how fast we reprint them, they always disappear so quickly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is the Babahlese tourism industry really that hot right now?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Of course! Although, recently, the most popular vacation destination has been the Republic of Borginia. But we refuse to lose to them, so we've been hard at work promoting Babahl!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Interesting. Well, I've just recently returned from a trip to Borginia myself.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh? And how did you like it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I-It was alright. <thought>I probably shouldn't bring up the fact that I was a suspect on the flight home.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The national symbol of Babahl is drawn here. There's nothing especially strange about it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Is it just me, or did the butterfly gain an antenna since we last saw it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even if it did, would it really have any bearing on our case, Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the charred remains of a fallen ceiling fan.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! I've seen a few of these before! They spin around and around, and play music!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I believe you're thinking of a musical mobile for babies.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes, that's it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But they're nothing alike.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">They're totally alike! They spin those babies right around, like a record!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I... see... I guess I can see how you might think that...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now then, Ambassador, I'd like to ask about your movements before the fire broke out.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Before the fire...? Which fire are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Which one? There was more than one tonight?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Huh? ...Oh, I see. I guess you didn't hear about it. We had two fires here at the Babahlese Embassy tonight. What a bother all of that was!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wait, but the only fire we know about is the one after the Jammin' Ninja's show!</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Ah, well, the first occurred at the start of the Jammin' Ninja's show. Luckily, only the fourth and fifth floors of out embassy caught in fire. Not wanting to cause a panic among the theatergoers, we decided to keep it internal.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then the fire after the Jammin' Ninja's show was the second one of the night?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So the fire I witnessed was the second one... <thought>Come to think of it, didn't Detective Badd make reference to the first fire...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-When was this photo taken?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Apparently, right after the fires... on the fourth and fifth floors were put out...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I suppose this means that the photo was taken just after the first fire was put out.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So then, what was the extent of the damage in the second fire?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">The second fire was contained to this floor, the third floor. I think it was left over embers from the fire on the floors above it that caused it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's... how should I put this... a very bad stroke of luck...</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">My office on the fifth floor, Manny's office here... ...and Manny himself... all gone in the blink of an eye.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I feel so sorry for you, Mr. Palaeno...</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oops, look at me going on and on. Now then, what was it you wanted to ask again?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We were discussing what your actions and whereabouts for today were. And, if you happened to know, what Mr. Coachen's actions and whereabouts were as well.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Yes, very well. Let's see, I've been quite busy all day from morning until now. First I woke up and then I brushed my teeth. After that, I had a roll for breakfast...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Fascinating... How about if you just skip to the relevant parts for me.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh! You'd like a condensed version? Alright, I can do that for you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So what did Mr. Coachen and you do this morning?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Well, originally, we were supposed to meet and shake hands with the Jammin' Ninja. But Manny and I wanted to turn it into a photo op, so we were here tidying up his office.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You helped clean Mr. Coachen's office...? Why were you not cleaning your own?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, I think I forgot to mention this, but my office is currently undergoing renovations <thought>Renovations - The Babahlese Embassy is undergoing renovations from top to bottom.</thought>. Which is why both the Primidux Statue and the Babahlese knife set are down here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, but the tidying didn't take much, really. We just burned some files we no longer needed and expired coupons in the fireplace.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I bet cleaning up the fireplace must've been a real pain though, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Ah, about that... I kind of forgot to clean the ashes out. Ha ha ha... I guess I'm up a creek without Manny here to get angry at me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">An ambassador like yourself has been on the receiving end of a secretary's anger?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, he was very good at being very mad. Why, even just this morning, he got mad at me. I spilled some Babahlese ink onto the back wall when I was burning the files, you see... ...and he got mad at me, saying that I should treat the ink with more respect.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......... <thought>Apparently, orders go up the chain of command around here.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">That's about it for what we did this morning. Just some cleaning.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Don't tell me you had no other work to do... being an ambassador and all.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now then, if you could tell me what you and Mr. Coachen did this afternoon...</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Well, Manny and I went down together to the Theatrum Neutralis. We had to be there for the start of the Steel Samurai stage show. After the show started, I went back to my office on the fifth floor alone.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So they were together until the start of the Steel Samurai show.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">A little while later, after I had straightened myself up a bit, I returned to the theater... ...because I was to take part in the photo op on-stage at the end of the show.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm......... <thought>There WAS a commemorative photo op at the end...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">It was a fantastic photo of the 3 of us -- Ambassador Alba, the Steel Samurai, and myself. After the photo shoot, I went back to my office on the fifth floor... ...to prepare for my handshake photo op with the Jammin' Ninja.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...He seems to be rather overworked for an ambassador.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">When I got to my office, that's when the first fire broke out and I escaped down the stairs. My office was completely destroyed, but thankfully, no one was hurt. I admit I ran away from the first fire as fast as my legs could carry me... ...but during the second one, I pitched in and helped the embassy staff put it out.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you didn't see Mr. Coachen again after the start of the Steel Samurai show?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Yes, that's right. The next time I saw him, he was lying there, in an eternal sleep.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see......... Ambassador Palaeno, I thank you very much for your help.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">I'm sorry I couldn't be of more assistance, Mr. Edgeworth. If there is anything else, please don't hesitate to ask, alright?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wonder if you might tell me what you noticed about Mr. Coachen's bottle of ink?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Umm... I just thought of it right now, but... ...during the second fire, Manny was worried about his office, so he came rushing back to it. I called out to him, and when I received no reply, I used my spare key to open the door... ...but when I did, I was greeted by roaring green flames. The flames were so big that I wasn't able to see into the room at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The fire was green...? What was the cause...?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Well, whitcrystal oil burns green when it's lit, as you can see by this lantern.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... And Babahlese ink is made from the same oil, which means it would also burn green.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">You know... ...I, too, had thought it was Manny's ink that had caught on fire. So that's why I was surprised to find out there was still a bottle of ink left on his desk!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The case of the perplexing green flames... Talk about a mystery!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What exactly was it that caught on fire in here...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe that you said you might have an idea as to why Mr. Coachen hired DeMasque II.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Actually, I fear it may be my fault. As I was telling you earlier... ...we were to determine which statue was the real one as a part of today's event.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But because of the Yatagarasu and the fire here, that got canceled, didn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Ha ha ha... I'm actually relieved the rest of the event has been canceled. For you see, Babahl's statue... well, it's just a replica.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And did Mr. Coachen know that about Babahl's Primidux Statue?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Of course he knew! That's why he was the only person I could consult with. We'd have to do something once our statue was revealed as a replica. As to be expected, I was very nervous today, as this would impact our country's authority.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I understand.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Well, when I told Manny my concerns, he said, "Let me handle it. It'll be alright. I'll find a way to make sure you're the ambassador of the re-united Cohdopia." At the time, I thought he was just trying to cheer me up... ...but when I saw that note, I realized he was serious...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Coachen... conducted a lot of business behind your back. I assume he did all that to ensure that you are the next Cohdopian ambassador.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">But... why was he trying so hard, I wonder? He was so much better at getting things done than I ever was or will be...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't know the answer to why he was trying so hard yet... ...but I suspect he had an ulterior motive in mind beyond just simple kindness.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">I lost a lot of things to those fires... Things like the many, many coupons we had printed... ...discount tickets for the cafeteria, and...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I should think that those blasted coupons were not the biggest victim here...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Everything this morning happened exactly as I said it did in my statement. Manny and I wanted to do a photo shoot with the Jammin' Ninja, so we tidied his office. That's about it. I can't think of anything else of interest.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If this guy is to be believed, an ambassador's job consists only of wasting time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, dear... If people were to find out that a murder occurred at our embassy... ...the number of tourists would plummet, as would our revenues! It'd be disaster! What are we going to do...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He really does seem worried. Perhaps I should refrain from bringing this up...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">This statue resembles that hero, the Steel Samurai, don't you think? I was thinking, what would you say to changing its name to the "Steel Samurai Statue"? It just might attract a few more tourists to our country if I did, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I'm not sure what to think... <thought>I thought that thing was a national treasure...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, I was wondering if you might have some thoughts on this.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">I think that you would know more about the case than I. So let me make it up to you for not knowing anything about that with these coupons!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Thank you, however, I feel I must decline.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So this is the real Primidux Statue...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This... is really valuable, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That's what they say.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay! You're not seriously considering the theft of this statue, are you...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No way, Mr. Edgeworth! I wasn't thinking about anything like that! I was just calculating, in my head, how much the statue is worth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... That sounds mighty suspicious to me.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>We still don't know where the blade of the Babahlese knife went. Could it be that the killer walked away with it...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">It looks like all of the souvenirs suffered some damage from the fire. I just don't believe it! Murder on top of arson!? What a disgrace to the name of the Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The fake Yatagarasu is guilty of much more than just theft, it seems.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I know! Because if it were me, my first priority would've been to loot this bookshelf!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You would steal ordinary souvenirs that you can buy virtually anywhere?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You can't buy them anywhere! Each one is specific to a location and has its own value! And items that have memories attached to them are the most valuable of all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But could you really rob someone of their valuable memories, just like that...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">! ...N-No! Because even if I take the souvenir, I can't take the owner's memories!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, would you happen to know what these charred remains are of?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Hmmmmmmmm... I don't know, actually. But I don't think there was anything there that should've been flammable.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>And so it remains a mystery to what was burned here...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... A grandfather clock. This one resembles the one in Allebahst.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oh, that clock has been with us since back when we were still Cohdopia.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That is one big clock! Hey, does this one have a bird that pops out like a cuckoo clock?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Ha ha... I'm sorry, but no. Oh, but I'm sure you'll love its chime!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Really!? It's going to be 11 soon, so maybe I'll get to hear it then!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is it that time already? Time sure flies by when I'm involved in an investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, it's not that late. The night's only just begun!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay, it's not good for you to stay up late, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes, gramps!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oh! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe, have you collected the information that I requested?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yup! Got it all right here, sir! Here you go, Kay. Feel free to take a look! It's for you, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What is all this, Gummy...?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It's all the information on this room that I got from the Embassy and Interpol people. Now we know exactly how this room was before and after the fire!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Good work, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Aww, it was nothing, sir! I'm an expert at getting people to talk!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow... You two remind me so much of my father and Uncle Badd...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">As prosecutor and detective, your dynamic is just like theirs back in the day.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, don't you worry! I'm going to find my own wonderful partner someday! And when I do, I'm going to become a good Yatagarasu, just like my father, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please don't ask me questions to which I have no answers to, Kay. However, I can say that is truly a wonderful thing to find a paetner you can trust.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Heh heh, you bet! So, what now, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well... I'd like to ask you for a favor.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That gadget... Mr. Thief, is it? That thing you call your secret weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, you mean "Little Thief"! Heh, you're coming to rely on it, aren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I don't need a crutch like that! I'm only asking because I need it for the investigation! From the information Detective Gumshoe gathered, and the ambassador's testimony... ...I'd like you to please re-create this room as it was during the third floor fire.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You got it! Alright, here we go! Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems there are other things besides what the ambassador mentioned that have changed. It's possible that we might find the escape route the person Kay saw used as well.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Oooh! Wh-What is this? Is it some sort of light show I was not told about?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This is the power of a true vigilante! It's re-creating the room with the info I inputted!</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Really!? That is certainly one interesting device you have there, Ms. Faraday!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ahem. I believe it's about time we returned to our investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ready for a review on how to use Little Thief!? OK, here we go! Objects outlined in yellow are things that are not present in our time, but were in the past. Things outlined in a dotted line are things that exist now, but didn't in the past.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You can examine and interact with replicated people and objects as you normally do. You can even present evidence whenever you find an inconsistency. Oh, and be sure to point out mistakes in the re-creation with evidence, too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think I remember now. Thank you for the refresher course, Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If there's something you don't get about Little Thief, feel free to ask anytime, OK?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I've inputted all of the info we got from Gummy and Ambassador Palaeno! With this re-creation, you should be able to tell what changed because of the fire! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's try investigating this room one more time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, let's. <thought>In order to find out what truly happened here in this room... ...we will need to gather more information from this room. It's time to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Looks like it was quite the fire, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, it appears that the flames spread fairly quickly to some of the other rooms as well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, but thanks to Gummy's info, I was able to re-create this room! Plus, the burnt stuff is still lying around, so you can check those as well!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The state of this room before and after the fire... I can probably obtain some new information by comparing the differences. Yes, that's what I'll do, and use any new information to complete my logic!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears that the desk is largely unchanged from before the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, it just got a little burnt, that's all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's a very fine desk. I'm sure that even now it's still usable.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If it's that great, why don't you trade your desk with it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It was just a suggestion! You didn't have to get all mono-syllabic on me, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, Babahl is really into pushing their tourism industry, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, it would appear that way.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You know, I'd really love to take a trip. Hey! Why don't we take one after this case!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Do you already have a destination in mind?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... Well, ideally, I'd like to go someplace where I can continue my thief training!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, if you want to learn the fine art of stealth... ...perhaps you should visit the studio where they make the Jammin' Ninja TV show.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey! That's actually a really great idea, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I can't believe she took me seriously.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective, you took part in the initial Babahl investigation, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yup, sure did! I also helped put out both fires, sir! But that first fire took me by surprise! I had a tough time escaping the fifth floor. First, I tried the elevator, but I guess someone else had the same idea 'cause it was in use. If I hadn't remembered to use the stairs at that point, I'd have burnt to a crisp!</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Wait! That's odd... We always warn our staff that in the case of a fire, it's dangerous to use the elevator.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Maybe someone rode it in a fit of panic?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective, did you see the "Yatagarasu" that came into the Babahlese Embassy at all?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I didn't personally... ...and the other staff members told me they never got a good look at the person, either, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... I wonder if you could tell me a bit more about what you discovered, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">The second fire broke out around the time the Yatagarasu was spotted in Allebahst. That's also when a suspicious person was spotted in Babahl, which caused some panic.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So no one was able to get a good look at this "Yatagarasu" that entered Babahl?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah. All they saw was a mysterious person wearing a long coat. But that's not enough to make a positive ID, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Still, it was enough to make the people who received the calling card panic even more.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A person in a long coat... Sounds like the exact same person I saw...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Yatagarasu that appeared in Allebahst was proven to be just a fabrication, a shadow. In light of that fact, the Yatagarasu that appeared in Babahl is also suspect.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You can't be serious! Not when we're this close to capturing the fake... I mean, Calisto Yew...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So the Yatagarasu appeared, caused mass confusion, killed Mr. Coachen, then disappeared.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By the way, Detective, why did you not chase after the Yatagarasu?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I-I did! But, well... this embassy is huge, sir! I got separated from the other staff members I was with, and was lost for a while there...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You didn't even memorize the layout of the building you were to guard, Detective!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Eeeeek! I'll be sure to do that from now on, siiiiir! But you know, it was thanks to me being lost that I was able to come to Kay's rescue!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? Is that a fact?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah! It was when I was lost and wandering around in the third floor hallways, sir! When I heard a scream, I headed towards it right away!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! That's probably from when I found Mr. Coachen's body!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah. I thought it sounded like her, so I got real worried and ran as fast as I could!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And it was thanks to Gummy that Ms. Shih-na wasn't able to take me away! He covered for me until you got here, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? I see. <thought>So he CAN be useful once in a blue moon.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Still, it's too bad that Agent Shih-na got here before I did.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... I wonder where Agent Shih-na was before you found her here?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, just before I got to this room, I saw her coming out of the room next door <thought>Shih-na's location - She was in the room next to Mr. Coachen's office up until she tried to arrest Kay.</thought>.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Shih-na mentioned something about chasing the Yatagarasu herself earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, she apparently helped in putting out the first fire. Then during the second fire I heard she was busy chasing the Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She seems to be a very dedicated agent. You would do well to learn from her.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Why are you pointing at me when you say that, sir...?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Those were some fires, sir. And we don't exactly have the manpower to fight it ourselves when they're THIS bad. So about the only thing we could do was to try and catch the arsonist. I feel so helpless thinking about it. I mean, we can't prevent this sort of thinf. We can only do something after it's happened...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">At least it's better than doing nothing. ...Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...I guess so, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, by this time, the Primidux Statues had already been swapped, eight?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They must have been, as this one is covered in soot.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What lousy timing! And just as the two countries were about to become friends again, too! It would've been better if I had stolen it than for it to get caught up in that fire...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, I think I understand your sentiment...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">..."However, if you were to engage in theft, I can't look the other way"... right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you could please stop stealing my lines!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It looks like one of the Babahlese knives was already missing before the fire began.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So it would seem. Especially since the other two knives' handles were burned away.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The remaining handle was swapped out with the handle from the real murder weapon... ...and Babahl's national treasure was stolen. Poor Babahl, don't you think!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm not sure I would lump the replica statue in with the rest of Babahl's woes...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This grandfather clock... It was apparently in a different position before the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">According to staff members, the clock was flush against the wall before the fire, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Which means that, most likely, it was moved by someone during the fire.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Speaking of which, it's totally 11 o'clock now, but I don't hear any chiming...</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Huh? That's odd... It was still chiming right on the dot of every hour this morning. Maybe the fire damaged its internal mechanisms or something...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, may we take a look inside that clock?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Sure, go right on ahead.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe, if you could please inspect the insides of this clock.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir! I'm on it!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth! I found this inside, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It... looks like a length of wire. So this is what caused the clock to stop chiming. But what was a long length of wire doing inside this clock in the first place?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">*sigh*... Why would someone do this... to such a valuable clock?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It sounds like it wasn't Mr. Palaeno that put the wire in there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then perhaps it was Mr. Coachen's killer who did!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These must have been the large green flames Ambassador Palaeno saw.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">With flames like these, it's no wonder he couldn't get it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, by the time you came into this room, had the fire already been put out?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, the fire had died out or something by that time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then this fire in here only burned from the time fire started on the third floor... ...until the Yatagarasu appeared and caused a stir in Babahl, I suppose.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I guess Mr. Palaeno was just lucky enough to run into this fire as it was burning, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, you could put it that way. And since you were the first to discover the body... ...we can assume that no one else entered the room until that time. No one other than the person you were chasing, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I knew it! That person I saw was definitely up to no good! I mean, that person could even be Mr. Coachen's killer!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That is very likely to be the case. After all, that person came into this room before you... ...and must have chosen this room precisely because they knew no one would be in here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">OK, then maybe the green fire was where it was to prevent anyone from coming in? But then, what did the person set on fire to make the green flames?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... Well, whatever it is that person burned, it made a rather sizable fire.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And since the fire's green... well, we've seen something that burns green, right!? It's a bit tinier than these flames, but you get what I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, and I do believe that what you are thinking is exactly why these flames are green. Which fire-related piece of evidence burns the same color as these green flames?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The source of the green in these flames is related to this!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, really? Well, I don't think they're related at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">O-Oh... .........Sorry. It really isn't related, after all...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey! You honestly apologized this time for being wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!? I-I'm always honest!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And that's a good thing! Now, just keep on doing it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Arngh... I-I need think about this a bit more carefully... If I stay calm, the answer should come to me. This green flame... it's the same as that other flame!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The silhouette lantern... Its green flame comes from the whitcrystal oil it's burning.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah! That's the fire I was thinking of, too! I love the green it gives off.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think we've now established that the green flames were caused by whitcrystal oil. Furthermore, we know that there is only one other thing made from whitcrystal oil.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! You mean that thing Mr. Palaeno was mistaken about, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, precisely... as we found out earlier in our investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Um, what? I don't get it. Can you fill me in, sir!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Fine, I suppose. I'll explain it in a way that even you can understand. This is the thing made from whitcrystal oil that Ambassador Palaeno was mistaken about!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, this piece of evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Is not needed anymore, right? Good, then I'll go throw it out for you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">N-No, wait!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? But why? I'm sure this piece is completely unnecessary... I mean, it didn't have anything to do with what we were talking about, after all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W-Well, either way, can I have it back for now? <thought>It would appear that I was the one who was mistaken this time... I need to think carefully about this one more time. Something made of whitcrystal that is still here in this very room... ...and that something is this!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Babahlese ink is made from whitcrystal oil.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ohhhh! So, it should burn the same color as the flames in the lantern, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, precisely. However, the green flames in this room were not from a bottle of Babahlese ink.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Because we found the ink Mr. Coachen used on his desk, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. However... we know that Mr. Coachen was smuggling the ink in massive quantities. Now, what do you suppose he made using all that ink? I believe what he made with that ink is the answer to what gave birth to the green flames.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, yeah! I'm beginning to really feel the energy coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Heh... It would appear that I've finally found it, the smuggling ring's real goal!</thought> Made of Babahlese ink, this is the source of the green flames!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In order for the green flames to arise, this piece of evidence was needed!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ha ha! And how did the arsonist use that, exactly? Oh, I know! Why don't we try lighting on fire and seeing what happens? I'm sort of an expert in pyrotechnics, so you just leave it to me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H-Hold on there! <thought>She was really all set to light it on fire...! It's a good thing this piece is related to the case, or it'd have gone up in smoke... I need to think carefully about this one more time. The real source of the green flames... It must be this!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What would consume that great of a volume of ink to make...? That would be... ...the counterfeit bills that the smuggling ring made and are circulating in Zheng Fa.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You're kidding!? You're saying that it was Mr. Coachen who made the counterfeit bills...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I am. I believe you could even go so far as to say that he "stole" Babahl's printing press. Ambassador, Mr. Coachen had permission to freely use the printing press, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Why, yes. And I do remember seeing him use it in the middle of the night... ...but never did I think he was using it for such a foul deed...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador! Because of your secretary's crimes, you will need to be investigated as well!</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Ah, yes, I suppose so. We've caused a bit of trouble for a few countries, haven't we?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It is my duty to search out all who shielded Mr. Coachen and concealed his crime. For they are the ones who started the fire in order to destroy the evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So the source of this green fire was Babahlese ink... And it was Babahlese ink that Mr. Coachen was smuggling in mass quantities. Clearly, the culprit started the fire to burn away the proof of that smuggling activity!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>We've examined everything in this office, but there is one thing that bothers me. Perhaps I should ask Ambassador Palaeno about it.</thought> Ambassador Palaeno, there is something I'd like to ask you about.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">About this office, it appears, to me, to be very similar to Ambassador Alba's office. For example, the location of the fireplace and the position of the grandfather clock.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Ah, that's right. You've also paid a visit to the Allebahstian side of the embassy. Our two embassies actually used to be one.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Yes, I know. Even the pamphlet mentioned that.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Which is why the building is bilaterally symmetrical <thought>Bilateral symmetry - Because this used to be on embassy, offices on the two sides are symmetrical.</thought>. So no matter which room, the location of the fireplace and the like are exactly the same. Even where the art is located is the same. As my room is currently under renovation... ...we worked hard to make Manny's room look like the ambassador's office.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You mean for your hand shake photo op with the Jammin' Ninja?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Yes, that's right. I mean, what's a photo like that worth if it's not taken in the ambassador's office right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Yet another odd expression of Babahl's obsessively competitive spirit with Allebahst, I take it?</thought> Thank you, Ambassador. That piece of information is all I needed to connect the dots.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">? ...Connect what dots? Well, anyway, I'm glad I was able to be of some help.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Allebahstian and Babahlese sides of the building are symmetrical to each other. As we know that to be a fact, then this room's fireplace may also hide a secret passageway.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A secret passageway?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In Allebahst, the fireplace turned out to have a revolving back wall.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A revolving wall!? It sounds like something out of a ninja house!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wow, there was a trick like that built into the fireplace, sir!?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">What!? Th-This embassy holds THAT kind of secret!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There seems to be a lot about this room that you don't know about, Ambassador...</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">I guess it's time to pay the bill for letting Manny do so much work for me. Please, I really want to know about the real Manny and what you know about this room.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What are you waiting for, Mr. Edgeworth!? Let's get to the bottom of this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agreed. And my first thought is that it's likely the killer used the revolving fireplace <thought>Revolving fireplace used? - It's possible someone used the revolving fireplace wall. I need to examine it more.</thought>.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It looks like just another fireplace, though, doesn't it? So, how you do turn it again?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In Allebahst, I had to push where the X was on the far wall of the fireplace.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oh! I see an X back there, sir! Let's see what happens when I push it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Aaaaah! You scared me, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is something about this fireplace that lies in contradiction to the facts.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? But we found an X where you thought there'd be one, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We did, but that's not what I was referring to. Something is missing from this scene. <thought>What does this contradiction mean for us...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If we push this X mark, the fireplace wall should turn.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">A revolving fireplace wall! That's neat, sir!? We should hurry up and...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wait, Detective! There is something we need to examine about this first. Besides which, there is also something I'd like to test.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Like what, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'll tell you later, Detective. For now, let's continue with the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">All I see inside this fireplace is starter wood.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? That's odd. It doesn't match up with what Mr. Palaeno said earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What is the meaning of this contradiction...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This points out exactly what is so contradictory about the fireplace as it currently is!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And what exactly is that?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Aw, it's OK if you don't see it, Kay! I don't really get it either, but I figure it's just too splendid for me to understand! So come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Why don't you tell us what exactly is so contradictory?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">U-Umm......... <thought>I can't exactly admit to being wrong if Detective Gumshoe is the one asking...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! My youth only lasts for so long, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, well... Let's take another look at the fireplace first, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">How come when I answer confidently, you take that to mean we're off course, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ambassador Palaeno, you said that you burned some old files in this fireplace today, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Yes, I burned quite a few files this morning, actually.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And after you did, you forgot to clean out the ashes from the fireplace, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Th-That's right. But why are you asking? And why are you making such a scary face...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sorry, I admit I am a bit intimidating when I'm serious. ...In any case! Take a good look at this fireplace, and tell me what you find odd about it.</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Let's see... Huh? Where did all the ashes go...? <thought>Missing ashes - The ashes that should still be in the fireplace are missing. Where did they go...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">What is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">You don't really think... that Ambassador Palaeno is lying, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, there is no reason for him to lie. And I don't believe his testimony is wrong, either. It is the fireplace that is causing the contradiction. Kay, I wonder if you might update the fireplace data for me.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You got it! I'll add in the ashes from the burnt files and...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Sounds like we've pretty much figured everything out now, huh!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Well, it was nothing. All I did was follow where our leads led us.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, I sense it coming on! You're about to dazzle us again, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oh, you mean that!? Well, it's what Mr. Edgeworth is known for, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...There is really no need for you two to dance around the name of what I'm about to do.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The ashes Ambassador Palaeno left here have disappeared. If we follow where this piece of information leads, we should begin to see the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's time to use your secret weapon, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah! Go on, sir! Use your special skill!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'll ignore your strange phrasing for now, and focus on the information we have instead. <thought>Just a little further... I can sense the truth lying on just the other side of this!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The reason as to why the ashes are missing is simple.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's not because someone cleaned them up, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, because even if someone did sweep them up, the fireplace is too clean for that. Ambassador Palaeno said that he spilled some Babahlese ink while he was burning the files. And yet, there is not a trace of the spilled ink on the back wall anywhere!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well then, I don't know what happened.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, I'll tell you what happened. The two sides were switched. By using the revolving fireplace wall, the ashes were moved into the neighboring room. Which means that this is a clear indication that the fireplace was used!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, you mean... the person I was chasing... ...disappeared from this room through there...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I believe the person you were in pursuit of is Mr. Coachen's killer. And after committing the murder, escaped through the fireplace <thought>Escaped through revolving fireplace - The person Kay was chasing used the fireplace to escape into the room next door.</thought>!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow, Mr. Edgeworth! You figured out the killer's escape route!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I have, but this is only the beginning. Now we have to chase the killer down!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If the killer used the fireplace in this room to escape into the next... ...then it's only logical for us to "talk" with the person who was in the neighboring room.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, the person that was in the next room was... Oh! It was that person, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, Detective... Agent Shih-na.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's looking more and more like Ms. Shih-na is the killer, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's not jump to conclusions yet. We need to go through what we know so far. She came running straight into this room from the next one, and instantly accused you. Furthermore, she claimed that it could only have been you that killed Mr. Coachen. I don't have any proof yet, however, I KNOW she is hiding something from us!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">OK, then! Why don't we go ask Ms. Shih-na herself!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, not yet. There's something that needs to be done first. ...Detective Gumshoe!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Sir! Is it my turn to do something, Mr. Edgeworth!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I have a two-part special assignment for you. First, I need you to run a handwriting analysis on DeMasque II's note.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">OK! I'll get the lab boys on that right away!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Second, I want you to see if you can fit through the revolving fireplace well.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">R-Right now, sir!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, next decade... Of course now! We need to test out hypothesis first, don't we?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Go on, Gummy! You can do it!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Alright. I'm gonna do this like a real man! Here I go, through the fireplace and back!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>You shouldn't need to psych yourself up that much for such a simple task, Detective...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wow! The wall inside the fireplace really DID turn!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's so neat! Now, I wanna try going through there, too!</line>
<line speaker="Palaeno">Th-There really IS a secret passageway through there... I had no idea...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... It would appear that the ash really was pushed into the other room. Furthermore, the Babahlese ink you spilled, Ambassador, is there on the back wall.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">OK, here I go, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective, I'd like you to go through there under the same conditions as the killer.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh? But there's all that ash and stuff...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And your point is? Now, we're short on time, so if you could please hurry on through.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Nngh... Y-Yes, sir...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">OK! So NOW we pretty much have the whole picture, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, not yet. There remains a few more mysteries to solve... ...such as the Yatagarasu's whereabouts, the other smuggling ring members... ...the two weapons that made it across the border, the key Ms. Yew stole 7 years ago... In fact, we haven't figured out a thing regarding how Ms. Yew is related to these embassies!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A number of pieces connect in a very complicated way in this case... It's almost enough to make one completely mentally exhausted.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What are you saying, Mr. Edgeworth!? I thought you were the one who said that it's easy if you follow the leads?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Was that supposed to be an impression of me, Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If it's info gathering you need, Gummy and I can help with that! Then, all you'd have to do is show off your fancy-schmancy logical deductions!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"Show off"...? <thought>Does it seem like I'm being boastful when I do that...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's not over-complicate matters, OK, Mr. Edgeworth!? We've been so focused, like a laser, on only what seems strange and out of place... ...it's no wonder nothing's clicked and we haven't unlocked anything yet. But, if we think things through calmly, the answer should come to us!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's the sort of thing I say to myself... ...when I'm practicing how to unlock padlocks, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That is something that I hope practice doesn't make perfect, for your sake.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ha ha ha! Yay! Looks like you're back to your straight-laced self again!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm back, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I can see that. Good work, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">*cough* *cough* *cough* L-Looks like you can use that fireplace like a door, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Are you alright, Gummy...?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I-I'm OK! It's just a bit of ash and dust, that's all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your jacket has gotten quite filthy. I see the hem has practically turned black.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah, well, quite a bit of the unburned ink got on it, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... I see. Thank you, Detective. You did a fine job. I'll even pay the cleaning bill for the trench coat.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What!? Oh, no, sir! I could never! This is just my old coat, sir! If it was a coat I actually cared about, then I'd get it cleaned, but, you know...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...? I see. Very well, then. As you wish.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So because Gummy was able to climb through the fireplace, we know it can be used, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, but that's not all we learned. We actually learned one other important fact.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And that is...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will have to explain it to you later. Right now, we need to deal with the handwriting analysis. Detective Gumshoe...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir! I'll be back before you know it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The handwriting analysis on Mr. Coachen's handwriting will take a bit of time. Let us go and wait in the Theatrum Neutralis, along with Agent Lang and Agent Shih-na!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "Little cubs, never do they know the real fury of the Elder wolves."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>These quotes are definitely becoming increasingly difficult to decipher...</thought> And what does that mean?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">It means that you'll never really know how angry I can get. Mr. Prosecutor... The counterfeit bills made with Babahlese ink... they were all of Zheng Fa denominations.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, so I heard from Ms. von Karma.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">But we don't know where the play money was gone.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>They must not have figured out that it was all burned yet...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Ever since those things showed up in circulation, my country's economy has taken a big hit. Zheng Fa is in financial chaos as we speak... ...because we can't tell the difference between our own bills and the fakes! But it's not just the money; the citizens are also worried. I've staked the honor of the house of Lang on this... ...and have come to this land to capture the mastermind behind this whole mess. I investigated how the bills were made and how the ink was smuggled into Zheng Fa... ...and I pursued the smuggling ring all the way here. But tonight... this is where the final chapter was written. Despite my frantic efforts to chase the smuggler down, someone got to him first... ...and now I'm called to return home without a single answer!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, I...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Don't start. It's not your fault. It's not anyone's fault, Mr. Prosecutor. Ambassador Alba, I'm sorry for all the trouble tonight.</line>
<line speaker="Alba">Oh, no, no. It is I who should apologize. It was all because I was not strong enough. If only I was able to think of a better solution... Quercus, you fool! Curse your empty brain!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh, you're being too hard on yourself, Ambassador. I take full responsibility for tonight, end of story. Shih-na, let's go. Time to return to our den.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I don't like to admit it, but there's not much else for us to do but to go home as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang! A moment, if you</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">You, Wolf-man and the secretary lady! <cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn> <cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn> Pal!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe...! Have you got the results of the handwriting analysis already?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yup, and that note... was definitely written by Mr. Coachen, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm, just as I thought... Good work, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... How long do you intend to hold us up for?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Sorry to have made you wait, but I believe that now everyone is finally here. Agent Shih-na. I'd like to ask you something, if you don't mind.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How exactly did you fail to see the Yatagarasu... ...when you were in the neighboring room to where Mr. Coachen was killed!? I'd like you to explain THAT to us.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What...? Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! What are you doing asking her about something she didn't see?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Agent Lang hasn't touched the Babahl investigation at all. So I suppose I will need to explain a few things to him first.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth... I can't even begin to imagine what's going on in that head of yours.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The only thing going on in my head... is the pursuit of the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Oh? It sounds like you have some sort of plan. Very well, I'll supervise you until the end.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>*sigh* Is she seriously going to treat me as a subordinate for the rest of the day...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">You're not trying to pick a fight with my subordinate on some flimsy guess, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm not trying to "pick a fight" and the evidence is hardly flimsy, as you will see.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! I should've known... ...that you and I are destined to fight it out to the very end!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It would appear that way.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Well, I'll prove her innocence, so let's see what you've got, Prosecutor Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... With pleasure. <thought>For my opening argument, I'll discuss the Yatagarasu that appeared in Babahl... ...and establish exactly who it was that Kay saw.</thought> Agent Lang. I assume you've been briefed on Kay's testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You mean the "suspicious person in a coat" that she saw?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right. That person is one of the keys to solving the case. The person who pretended to be the Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">"Pretended"? And what do you mean by that!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'll get to that in a second, but first, I want to review what this person Kay saw did. Kay, if you could please explain what the person you were chasing did for us...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">OK! You got it! I first spotted the suspicious person near the open-air stage on the Babahlese side. I called out to the person, but as soon as I did, that person ran off. I thought it was rather suspicious, so I immediately gave chase.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">For the sake of argument, let's call this suspicious person the Yatagarasu. Now, please tell us what happened when you chased the Yatagarasu up to the 3rd floor.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Can do! I chased the Yatagarasu all the way up to the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy. It was a pretty straight chase down the hallway, until the sudden turn. The Yatagarasu disappeared around the corner, so I did my best to catch up. When I turned the corner, I saw the Yatagarasu run into Mr. Coachen's office. I gave chase and ran into the room... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the lights, but then...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Who's there!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">By the time I had turned on the lights, the Yatagarasu had disappeared.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When Kay entered the room, the person she was chasing was already gone. Why do you suppose that was, Agent Lang?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...What do you mean, "Why do you suppose?" Isn't it obvious!? The person slipped out through the door behind the girl under the cover of darkness.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sorry, but I know for a fact that the person didn't escape through that door!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Oh? And how do you know that with such certainly!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... That's easy. If the Yatagarasu had left through that door, they would have run right into this person!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the person the suspicious person would've ran into!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Huh? Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... Are you sure you're not losing it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I haven't lost anything, and certainly not my mind.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Maybe not, but you definitely have the wrong person. Or maybe you're just terrible with not only logic, but names as well!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnnngggghhhhooooh! <thought>I know I was mistaken, but you didn't have to insult me! Think, Miles! Recall the circumstances around Kay's near-arrest! There was someone right next to Mr. Coachen's office investigating at the time!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Y-Your answer is Shih-na...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, because let's consider what would've happened if the Yatagarasu had used the door. When Kay screamed upon discovering Mr. Coachen's body... ...the Yatagarasu would've run right into Agent Shih-na, who was in the next room over.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Arngh!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Shih-na. Would you mind telling us if you saw the suspicious person in question?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........No, I didn't see anyone.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You see? Therefore, the Yatagarasu could not have escaped through the door as</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">It just means that the creep slipped out before Shih-na made it out into the hallway!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. I doubt that, as there was another person in that hallway. A certain detective. Detective Gumshoe, where were you exactly at that time?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">M-Me, sir? Well, when I heard Kay's scream... ...I ran towards Mr. Coachen's office from the opposite direction of Agent Shih-na, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, Agent Lang, can YOU explain how someone could've eluded both of them!? Even you must concede that under these circumstances, the door was not a viable route!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Grr...rrrnoooooooooh!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! You nailed him with just an explanation of what happened!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... I've eliminated one of the possible escape routes from that room. <thought>But this is far from over. I need to make Agent Lang aware as well... ...of yet another possible escape route the Yatagarasu could've taken.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">.........! Ha ha ha ha! I get it! So that's what you were trying to show me. Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... Let me guess. This what you're trying to say, right? Because the door was not a viable escape route, then there must've been another way out!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to bust out with our revolving fireplace wall explanation, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, not quite yet.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? But why? I thought this would be the perfect time...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The revolving wall on the Babahlese side is known only to four people. And if we use this information unwisely, the truth may escape us in the end.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What's with all the whispering over there? Scared I'll figure out our tactics?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph, nothing of the sort, Agent Lang. Come, let's continue where we left off.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That smug, haughty attitude of yours... You really rub me the wrong way, you know that!? ...Hmph. Well, no matter. I've figured you out already anyway. The only other possible escape route besides the door... is the room's lone window! And since an eerie picture of said escape route exists... Are you saying that this photo captures the moment of the Yatagarasu's escape!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I guess Detective Badd must have filled him in on this photo... I have to admit that at first, I thought the window to be a possible escape route as well. However, I now know that to be impossible!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Now, I realize you may not know this, but... ...humans can't fly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course I know that! That's bloody common sense! Besides, I never said I thought that photo to be of the Yatagarasu's escape route.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...I suppose not. Alright then, explain yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu that Kay was chasing after.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You can say whatever you'd like in whatever language you want... ...but there's only one language I really understand: the language of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well, then. I present to you, proof that the person Kay saw is not the same as the one in this photo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This piece of evidence proves that the shadow in the photo is not the person Kay saw!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Oh, is that right? What do you think, little miss?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!? Well, umm... Gummy, what do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Me!? Umm, I... Ms. von Karma, what do you think, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I don't think anything, because I already know that evidence proves absolutely nothing!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Aha ha ha ha ha! Looks like you've got a mutiny on your hands, Mr. Prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh! <thought>The last thing I needed was him laughing in my face! I need to think back to what Detective Badd told me... ...about when this photo was taken.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let me explain to you precisely why the shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu Kay saw. Kay spotted the Yatagarasu heading for the third floor during the second fire. However, the photo in question was taken just after the first fire!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Grr...rrrnoooooooooooh!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah! Way to go! That's TWICE you've bit him in the butt now!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">We're not done yet! You still have to explain what that shadow is... ...and how the Yatagarasu escaped! I don't suppose you can answer both, can you!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Regarding the photo, I admit that we don't understand what it means quite yet.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! As I thought.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, the Yatagarasu's escape route? Now, THAT I can answer.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You can? Well, then, Mr. Prosecutor, go on! Enlighten me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even if I explain it, you'll try to find some flaw with what I have to say. You were busy heading up the Allebahstian investigation, correct? In that case, I doubt you'd have much knowledge about the Babahlese side of the case... ...so wouldn't it be best if the lead on that side, Agent Shih-na, explained in my stead?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">.........Argh! Shih-na is my subordinate...! If I don't stick up for her, how can I look her in the eyes and call myself her boss...!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........Lang, it's alright. I can take care of him.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Shih-na.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">You've shielded me a lot as my boss... ...but it's time for me to prove my worth.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Alright. If you're OK with it, then you have my support.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Finally, it's down to just Agent Shih-na and myself. This is where the battle really begins!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Now then, what is it you'd like to ask?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm, let's see... Why don't we start with your movements inside the Babahlese Embassy?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">During the first Babahlese fire, I assisted in putting out the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">And that is all I have to say.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But I'm not lying when I say I saw the suspicious person run into Mr. Coachen's office! Like I said earlier... ...I have no intention of retracting my testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........Good.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Just to confirm, did you have a partner when you were on your investigation?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">No, I moved alone.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, you have no one to corroborate your alibi. Is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Are you calling her suspicious because she was in a room by herself!? How pathetic!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...And it wasn't when Agent Shih-na tried to arrest Kay under the same rationale?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">............!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And how about when you accused Larry because he was the weapon's owner?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">............Grr!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Not that it's unexpected for that useless lump to get into such a situation. Although, I suppose it's never a good idea to let mistakes go uncorrected.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I will make no excuse for what I did in that situation.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Then you should apologize right now for making Kay out to be the killer, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">.........I'm sorry. Shih-na, apologize.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">..........................................I'm sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I-It's really OK! I mean, I'm not under suspicion anymore! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Well, I never doubted you. Not for one second.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">.........And the same goes for me. I believe in Shih-na.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then let's put that to the test, and see if she is really worthy of your trust.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Heh heh... This promises to be interesting.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">During the first Babahlese fire, I assisted in putting out the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you helped with the fire extinguishing effort?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I was in charge of the police on the Babahlese side, so I helped them with their work.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Police doing the job of firemen... You really know how to work people.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">She sure does. That's because she's one awesome woman who knows how to manage.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I guess so! She's always bringing you a business card or a scroll at just the right time!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">To prepare everything before I'm ordered to... That is the definition of a secretary.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">She kinda seems more capable than Agent Lang, doesn't she?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">At the very least, she's certainly more capable than you, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oogh... I kinda had a feeling you were going to say that.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Shih-na's more than just a capable secretary, you know. Shih-na, tell him what other things you're good at.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Alright.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">During the second fire, I was searching for the Yatagarasu that had appeared in Babahl.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By "the second fire", you mean the one that consumed the third floor of Babahl, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Yes. That was when the suspicious person was spotted in Babahl.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, you WERE after the same person in the long coat that I was after!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">There is no proof that the suspicious person was really the Yatagarasu... ...because no one was able to get a good look at the person's face.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... By the way, how was your team's investigation?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">In order to extinguish the fire, water was pumped into the third floor via the windows. So the majority of the investigators conducted their searches on other floors.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Maybe they did, but there was one person who was wandering around lost on the third floor.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">When the fire was pretty much out, I moved to investigate the third floor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And you did that alone...?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">While I was searching, I heard a scream coming from the next room over.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you were in the room next to Mr. Coachen's office.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I already told you I was earlier. As I was examining the neighboring room... ...I heard that girl's shrill scream. Upon hearing her, I immediately ran towards Mr. Coachen's office.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wherein, you proceeded to arrest her, as I recall.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Yes, I did.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">But she was totally innocent, pal! I thought we had already cleared that up!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...And I thought I had already apologized for my behavior. Now if the tenacious detective would be so kind as to be quiet...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oongh!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have to agree. Right now is not the time to take issue with that.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Nngh... Not you, too, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But what I do take issue with is the fact that you didn't see the Yatagarasu, Agent Shih-na.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Hmph... The prosecutors of this country are all so strange.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Although I was in the next room, I was unable to catch a glimpse of the Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You were unable to catch even a glimpse, despite being in the next room? Is that true?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...I really hate to repeat myself.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph......... I'm sorry for inconveniencing you... ...however, I simply wish to make sure that you are not mis-remembering something. We wouldn't want you to be accused of lying later on, would we?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... Are you calling Shih-na's testimony a lie!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, I'm talking with Agent Shih-na right now... ...so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't interrupt us with superfluous comments!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Grr...rrr.........! Grrrrrrrrrnnnnngh!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww... You know, I feel kinda bad for him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I understand his pain at watching one of his subordinates being accused... ...however, I cannot turn my eyes from the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Lang... I'm alright. And as for you, I think you should be focusing your doubts on that girl rather than me.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...And why is that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">To be honest, I'm actually very skeptical that the girl's "Yatagarasu" even exists.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you throwing Kay's words into doubt again?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Well, she does claim to be the Yatagarasu, right? And she did try to chase down the Yatagarasu, despite being just an average children.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Actually, she came here with the goal of capturing the fake Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right, which is why I would never lie about anything related to the Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">And I suppose you have proof of that somewhere?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Not quite, but even without any, I have people who believe in me, and that's enough.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...I see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay's testimony is without flaw, but as for yours... Well, let's just say that I find your testimony to be a bit suspicious.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... There seems to be a very large flaw in her testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh? Then why don't you show her using what we found out with Little Thief?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... I will, in due time. <thought>The escape route of the Yatagarasu that Kay was in pursuit of... If it turns out that it really does lead right to Agent Shih-na... ...then what is it that she is keeping from us right now?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Being in the room next to Mr. Coachen's office is the problem with your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor... I don't see what problem you're talking about at all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, do you recall the secret we discovered about the Allebahstian office fireplace?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Huh? Oh, you mean how it connects the office with the room next door? What about it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well... Allebast isn't the only country with secret connecting fireplaces.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Wha--!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The fireplace in Mr. Coachen's office holds the exact same secret!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Wh...Whaaaaaaaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Yatagarasu didn't escape through the door to the room or the window. The escape route was through the revolving fireplace wall and into the next room over!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now do you see? If the Yatagarasu had escaped into the next room... ...then the thief would've run straight into Agent Shih-na! Meaning that it's impossible for her to have missed the Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">A.........Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaa!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Wh-What is the meaning of this, Miles!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well? Would you care to explain, Agent Shih-na... ...how you managed to completely miss the fleeing Yatagarasu, or shall I?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">............</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your claim that you were in the next room was a lie all along, wasn't it? The truth is, you were the one Kay saw in the coat... ...pretending to be the Yatagarasu, and you were the one she chased after. As you tried to lose her, you ran into Mr. Coachen's office, and headed for the fireplace. Then, you shed your coat in the next room, leaving it there to emerge as "Agent Shih-na". After that, you came back around to place Kay under arrest. Does that sound about right? If not, then speak now or forever hold your peace.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">............</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">How dare you make Kay look like the bad guy when you're the suspicious one, pal!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........Phwwh... Phwwwwh...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Shih-na...?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Hee... hee hee hee......... ...Hee hee hee hee hee... hee hee......... Aha! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! <thought>That... That laugh...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I remember this irritating laugh...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Brr... I'm getting chills down my spine...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">.........It can't be... But it has to be...!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Shih-na... What's wrong with you...?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Phwwh... I'm sorry. It was so funny that I couldn't help but laugh.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..."Funny", you say?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Yes, that you would accuse me of being the Yatagarasu. ...The prosecutors of this country really are all so very strange.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Do you think you can get away with this by simply laughing it off!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Phwwh... You think I'M taking things too lightly? I think not. It's that prosecutor who is.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Look, everything you said earlier is nothing more than mere speculation. The Yatagarasu fled through the fireplace? Do you have any proof to back up your claim? If you don't, then you haven't proven a thing regarding the Yatagarasu's escape route!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The tone of voice you're taking with me now has certainly changed.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Heh heh... That's because it's been a while since I've had this much fun. I think I'll let loose, and then we can have a real battle of wits.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">For an agent of Interpol to show me the true power of her mind, it is a great honor.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Phwwwh... Don't underestimate me; I'm not some foolish broad, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I know. And that is why I won't hold anything back either as I answer your question.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">My question...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Here is your proof that the revolving fireplace wall in Babahl was used recently!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">My honest answer is this!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Ahah! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What was THAT for!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">It was just MY honest answer to that piece of evidence. Ahah! It means that his piece of evidence was only worth a sudden outburst of laughter!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hang in there, Mr. Edgeworth! Just remember what happened to me when I went through that revolving door!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But what happened to you is irrelevant to the topic at hand...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Aww... But I even got coat covered in ash trying to squeeze my way through...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hold on... Maybe his dirtied coat IS relevant after all. I should think back to what the fireplace was like when we were investigating it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I'm sorry, but is this really your honest answer to my question?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. According to Ambassador Palaeno's testimony... ...he said that he was burning some documents in the fireplace with Mr. Coachen.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The ashes of what they burned were left in the fireplace, so they should've been there. However, when we went to investigate the room, the ashes weren't there.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Why is that a problem? Maybe someone cleaned them up?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph......... Unfortunately for you, Ambassador Palaeno said that he forgot to. And so the question remains: Why were the ashes missing? ...The answer is simple. When the Yatagarasu went through the fireplace wall... ...the ashes were pushed into the next room by the wall as well! The movement of the ashes that were in Mr. Coachen's office is my proof!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Ahah! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........And just what is so funny!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Ash as proof...? Are you even allowed to submit such flakey evidence in court?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You... still wish to fight us?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Of course. Why wouldn't I?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, let's hear your counterargument.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Phwwwh... My counterargument, huh? This really is just like being in court.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, to me, we're simply continuing from where we left off all those years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Phwwwh. I have no idea what you're talking about.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It doesn't matter if we're at a crime scene or in court, let's finish this here and now!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I suppose. I've had a lot of fun today, but I grow weary of this game of cat and mouse.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Let's make this the last testimony, and wrap up this absurd case once and for all!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">In my eyes, all you've proved is that the rotating fireplace wall was used...</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Phwwwh... And there you have it, my counterargument.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Arngh! <thought>That's very... impressive. She has seen through to the fact that I have yet to gather that one piece of evidence...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">............</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What is it, Kay? I haven't heard a peep out of you in quite a while now.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But I...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay... Pull yourself together. You are the true heir to the Yatagarasu name, are you not?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you want to steal the truth, then you must never take your eyes off of it. This chase you're running to catch the truth... you must see it through to the very end.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... You're right. I... I will see this through to the end. So...... You go get her for me, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... With pleasure.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Looks like a lack of evidence has left you wide open, doesn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Shih-na. Please... show me you're someone I can trust.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">......... Don't worry. This will be the deciding match. You'll see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I'm truly sorry, Agent Lang, but I simply can't allow her to escape me again.</thought> Very well then, Agent Shih-na. Shall we begin?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Phwwh... I'm ready whenever you are.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">In my eyes, all you've proved is that the rotating fireplace wall was used...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........It sounds to me like you're saying my explanation is not good enough.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">But I was able to go through the revolving door myself! So that should be proof enough, even for you, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Hah... It looks like you don't quite understand. But by your looks, I can guess that you're not all that learned.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeowch! Talk about rude! You should watch what you say, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Sadly, I can't say I disagree with her on that one.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">But you know what I mean, right? You may have proven that the fireplace was used...</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...but you can't really call that proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace, now can you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you want proof that the Yatagarasu was the one who used the fireplace?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">That's right. Well? Do you have any?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Can you prove that it WASN'T the Yatagarasu who used the fireplace?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I don't need to prove anything to you.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">O...<cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, if you could please not steal my line...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">S-Sorry... But I just couldn't hold it anymore!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, don't fret and leave her to me. All you have to do is sit back and watch.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Ahah! You may seem to have some wiggle room, but without any evidence, it's meaningless.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">So then, who was it that used the rotating wall? Show me your answer with real evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's possible that the Yatagarasu left fingerprints inside the fireplace!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Sorry, but I had the forensics team check that already. All they found were prints belonging to Ambassador Palaeno and Mr. Coachen.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Curses! <thought>I should've known better than to think the Yatagarasu would have been so careless. But there must be some sort of evidence that we still have yet to found!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Ahah... I take it you have no further objections?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Remember, we've already finished our very thorough investigation...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So Interpol has finished examining the entire Babahlese Embassy?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Yes. The investigators who weren't allowed into Allebahst were incredibly helpful. They all put in great efforts to search for any sign of the Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">And yet, despite all that effort... ...it appears that they failed to notice the lack of ash in the office fireplace. Furthermore, you were the one who inspected the room next to Mr. Coachen's, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I didn't notice the ash there in the fireplace of that room, and for that, I am sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You don't need to apologize, Shih-na. As your boss, your mistakes are my mistakes... ...so allow me to apologize for you. .........I'm sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You know, maybe this guy's not such a bad guy after all!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">He apologizes for his subordinate and everything. What a great boss!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........Are you saying that I don't do anything for my own subordinates?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ack! N-N-N-No, nothing of the sort, sir! You're someone I really respect, sir! Even if you are a bit... too strict sometimes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That is only a problem on your end.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow, way to be super hard on him in response!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Am I really too strict on everyone?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Anyway, Shih-na. You didn't find anything in Mr. Coachen's office, right?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">That's right. We finished our investigation...</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...and we found not a single suspicious thing in Mr. Coachen's office.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you really didn't find anything?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Yes, as I said, not one suspicious thing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Although, as you already know... ...we did find the Yatagarasu's Key and the document detailing the smuggling operation. But we still haven't found the blade that belongs to the Babahlese knife handle yet.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! You see? My subordinates worked hard to investigate everything. So there was nothing else to find, alright?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wow, Agent Lang's really sticks up for his people.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "All men are brothers. And friends become family." Hmph. So you see, my people are my family, and their families are my family, too.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That's a rather large family you have there...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, but as we all know, there is always one black sheep in any family. And though it pains me, Agent Lang, you WILL know the black sheep in your family!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">............</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... I think she's mad at you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Perhaps. <thought>But our definitions of reality are a tad different.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Are the two of you done chatting?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You didn't find anything suspicious at all? I highly doubt that.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">But I didn't. You can even ask the other men.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. I don't need to, for I found what you should have a while ago.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Excuse me...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In Mr. Coachen's office, there were signs that someone had burned counterfeit bills there!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What in the--!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Aiiiiiyaaaaa!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">That "evidence" was something you found out through that girl's machine, right?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So what if it was?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Ahh, that's what I thought. But unfortunately for you, a re-creation made by a machine is hardly concrete proof. Among the ashes you found in the room, did you happen to find any counterfeit bills?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........No.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">You see? So there was nothing in that office; nothing you can call "evidence", anyway!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Speaking of things that you Interpol agents have missed, I did find one more.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Your pompous attitude is unnecessary. All I require is the evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well. <thought>I'll show her the hidden piece of evidence that her and her fellow Interpol agents missed!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is what you and your agents missed.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey now, Mr. Prosecutor. Are you trying to smear the good name of Interpol?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course not.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Then are you trying to slander Agent Lang and I? Or are you just presenting unrelated evidence in the hope of fooling us?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh--!? It's not unrelated!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Watch what you say, because you're this close to getting into a fight with Interpol. Did you even think things through? If you can't even do that, then get out of my face!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arrrnngh! <thought>What do you say to something like that...!? I admit it's not likely that they would've overlooked it, had it been a regular investigation... ...and it's only thanks to Kay's gadget that we were able to move forward at all. Which means that I should show them what we found in that most unusual place!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd like for you to take a look at this length of wire.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">And what exactly is this supposed to mean?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">A length of wire? So what about it!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'll tell you what. We found this in the Babahlese Embassy not long ago.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And we found it wound up inside the grandfather clock in Mr. Coachen's office.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You found that... at the scene of Mr. Coachen's murder!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So I think you'll agree now... ...that I cannot trust you when you say that Interpol has thoroughly checked every room!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. While you say that you and your agents have finished your thorough investigation... ...are you absolutely certain that you didn't overlook anything?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Well! Aren't we full of ourselves, standing there insulting Interpol agents!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You'd better not be insinuating that my men are incompetent, Mr. Prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd never do that. However, it doesn't change the fact that they did overlook something. I'd like for you to take a look at this length of wire.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">And what exactly is this supposed to mean?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">A length of wire? So what about it!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'll tell you what. We found this in the Babahlese Embassy not long ago.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And we found it wound up inside the grandfather clock in Mr. Coachen's office.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You found that... at the scene of Mr. Coachen's murder!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But this wire wasn't all we found. We found one another very important thing.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">There's more!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In Mr. Coachen's office, there were signs that someone had burned counterfeit bills there!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What in the--!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Aiiiiiyaaaaa!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">That "evidence" was something you found out through that girl's machine, right?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So what if it was?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Ahh, that's what I thought. But unfortunately for you, a re-creation made by a machine is hardly concrete proof. Among the ashes you found in the room, did you happen to find any counterfeit bills?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........No.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">You see? So there was nothing in that office; nothing you can call "evidence", anyway!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sorry, but I seem to have given you the wrong impression.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">How so?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't recall saying that I was presenting evidence of any sort. But rather, I was pointing out that your investigation was incomplete.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So... do you actually have any proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace passageway?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, I haven't found any yet.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then what are we going to do!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. There's no need to worry. Because there is a loophole in Ms. Interpol Agent's argument we can exploit first. <thought>The one in charge of the Babahlese investigation was not Agent Lang. Which means that with Agent Shih-na in charge... ...it's possible she may have tampered with the evidence. That piece of evidence that we found... If there is one thing I DO know, it is that someone tried to hide it from us!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And that this throws doubt on the purity of your investigation into the Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...! You still suspect me, I see. Alright then, I ask that you point out what part of my investigation is incomplete.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The other Interpol agents worked under the command of Agent Shih-na. And is it not possible that the reason the person Kay was chasing chose the third floor... ...was because that person knew there would be no other agents on that floor? Furthermore, we've come to see that Agent Shih-na... ...was only pretending to be investigating the Yatagarasu, to the point of arresting Kay. In that case, there is one location that no one has yet to inspect!</thought> Your team's investigation was incomplete because they failed to inspect this location!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">OK! I'll go check it out right now, sir! Be right back!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">We already went over that area with a fine-toothed comb!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">And I've heard their extensively detail report about that area as well.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I have also heard the reports.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Actually, thinking back on it, I checked out that area pretty well already, too.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I guess that means we really don't need to check that area anymore, right, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... well, if that is everyone's opinion, then I suppose not.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Ahah! What happened to trusting in your instinct!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......... <thought>She does have me there...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The location, Agent Shih-na, is of course, the room you claimed to have examined. I believe the room next to Mr. Coachen's office warrants a thorough inspection.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Even if you do that, I doubt you'll find anything of use to you there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. I will be the one to decide that! Detective Gumshoe!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir! I'm on it! I'll be right back after I check out that room next to the office!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Do you really think that Ms. Shih-na's the Yatagarasu?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Yes, if my logic is sound, I believe she is.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, I'm not going to let her get away with ruining the name of the Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">But can you prove she's the Yatagarasu is the question.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If Detective Gumshoe can find what I'm hoping he will find, then I should be able to.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">And just what are you hoping he'll find?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's just say this. I had Detective Gumshoe do a little experiment for me earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">An experiment? As if that detective has the brains for high science.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It wasn't that mentally taxing. I had him use the same escape route as the Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">And what did you find out by doing that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">First, that it's possible for a person to fit through the revolving wall "door". Second, that by going through there, his coat was covered in ash and Babahlese ink.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Who cares what his coat was covered in? It's not worth that much anyway!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ah, but is it really worth so little? I believe that it's actually quite a meaningful result, the value of which I'm about to prove.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth! I've found some things you really need to see, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? So what are these things that you found?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ummm... Some make-up, a coat, and a pair of shoes, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You found a coat!? You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Maybe it's the one the person I was chasing was wearing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, the possibility does exist. Agent Shih-na. Were these pieces of evidence not in that room when you examined it?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Phwwwh... Unfortunately for you, those aren't "suspicious items" of any sort. They all belong to me. They were getting in the way, so I stored them in that room.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Aww...!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Thank you for bringing them to me. It saves me a trip. May I have them back now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These items that the detective brought back are incredibly significant. I request that we be allowed to examine them.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">They're my personal belongings, so you have no right to touch them without my permission.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wish to examine them for the sake of the investigation. But if you wish to deny us access to them... Agent Lang, let's hear your opinion on this.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I say, let them look at your stuff, Shih-na.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Lang!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Shih-na, let's put it all out in the open. If you're really innocent, then you have nothing to worry about, right?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........I guess so, Alright, go ahead and examine whatever you'd like. After all, I have nothing to hide.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Good. Now let us begin.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">So which of Agent Shih-na's belongings are you going to examine, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe I'll examine her make-up. ...Hm? What is this...? It looks like... a very thin paintbrush.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">It's a lip brush. It's for putting on my lipstick.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ack! I found something with a lot of weird powder inside, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That's just foundation powder in there. It's nothing to get worked up over.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! You two sure know a lot about make-up! I think In eed to confiscate them for a bit! ...Ooh, I never knew make-up consisted of this stuff, too! Hmm... I see... Ooh...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She seems to be completely absorbed in her study of cosmetics...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I guess there really wasn't anything suspicious in Agent Shih-na's make up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose not. Let us move on and examine something else.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let us examine her shoes. Hmm... There doesn't appear to be anything particularly odd about them.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. You know what they say about men who stare at a woman's shoes for too long, right?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Ahah! How scandalous!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I am merely doing my job, Agent Lang. I don't see how that warranted a comment. Now then, there is some dirt on the soles, but otherwise, these seem perfectly normal.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I guess there really wasn't anything suspicious in Agent Shih-na's shoes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose not. Let us move on and examine something else.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's examine the coat.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears you managed to stain your coat rather badly... ...Agent Shih-na.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">............</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Yatagarasu that Kay saw was wearing a coat. And I'm beginning to wonder if this stain wasn't created when you went through the fireplace.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Ahah... No, you have it wrong. That soot probably got on my coat when I was helping the police put on the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what about the dark substance around the hem of your coat?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Oh! I didn't realize that the hem was that dirty. I'm sure it's just some water mixed with soot from when I was helping with the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I don't think so! You think you can get away with such a transparent lie!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yeah! Don't lie to us, pal! This is the same pattern of dirt that got on my coat when I went through the fireplace!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Your words ring hollow in the absence of evidence, you know. So unless you can prove that the dirt on my coat is from the fireplace...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Which I can.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Wh...!? How...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You did a great job, Detective Gumshoe.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh? M-Me, sir? What did I do?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This coat... This is exactly the piece of evidence I was searching for. I had been hoping to find the coat that the person Kay saw was wearing. And thanks to you, we proved that going through the fireplace would sully a coat.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I don't quite get what you're saying, but I'm happy for the praise, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">All that remains... ...is for us to show what the dark substance on the coat hem is.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Oh? And you think you can do that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course I can. This is the dark substance that sullied the hem of this coat!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is what caused the hem of the coat to turn black!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I have no idea what you're trying to prove with that. But if you want, why don't we try and see if we can dirty your clothes with that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-What!? Sully my clothes!? Preposterous. ...Detective Gumshoe!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">N-No way, sir! Please don't make me dirty up my coat any more than I already have, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then I guess we'll just have to use yours, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">D-Don't you dare lay a finger on my clothes! *sigh* I suppose I have no choice but to show you another piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">B-Babahlese ink?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. This is what will prove that the coat went through that fireplace! According to Ambassador Palaeno, he burned some files in the fireplace this morning.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">You told us about that already, so I don't really see the point in mentioning it again.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">My point is that he spilled some ink onto the back wall of the fireplace at that time.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If the dark substance on this coat turns out to be Babahlese ink... ...it would prove that you and this coat went through the revolving fireplace wall!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Ack!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Sorry to have clipped one of your wings, "Yatagarasu", but we're not finished yet.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">But you have no way of proving whether or not this is Babahlese ink on the coat hem!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh, but I do. And I intend to show that is IS ink in a few seconds.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">How...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How, you ask? Well, since you don't seem to know, allow me to show you. This is how I will prove that the dark substance on the coat is Babahlese ink!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By the texture, we should be able to tell what the substance is.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">OK, then I'll give it a feel, sir! ...It feels kinda rough.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thank you for that frivolous comment. Now, if you could feel the stain on the hem.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Aaah! My fingers got all dirty when I touched the dark spot, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They got dirty, did they? I knew it. So it must be Babahlese ink...</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Just because his fingers got dirty, that's your way of proving it's Babahlese ink? Sorry, but any ink in the world would make one's fingers dirty!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnnghoooh! <thought>Arngh! I should've known better! It's useless to use such a far-fetched tactic! I need to use a method that Agent Shih-na can't refute, no matter how she may try!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We will know if someone were to wear the coat. ...Detective Gumshoe.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Phwwh... Wait! Are you trying to ruin my coat!? You don't honestly believe that tub of lard can fit into my coat, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well. Franziska, can you please give it a try?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">There is absolutely no point in me wearing that gaudy coat.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, you're not really that mad, are you, Ms. Shih-na?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Well, it's not MY fault if she is. Because it's YOURS, Miles Edgeworth! You and your ridiculous suggestion!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-Why is it My fault...!? <thought>I need to use a method that Agent Shih-na can't refute, no matter how she may try!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We can find out whether that is Babahlese ink or not by lighting it on fire.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That's how you're going to prove that it's Babahlese ink?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. If you could please cut a section of the dark, stained area for me, I'd appreciate it. Because I will show you, here and now, what the dark substance is!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Shih-na... Sorry to do this, but I'm going to have to cut off a bit of your coat.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Go ahead. I wasn't planning to wear it anymore anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now then, if someone could loan me a lighter or something...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! I've got some matches! I always carry them with me so I can light smoke bombs!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, if I could please have one, Kay, we can get this experiment underway.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The flame...!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">It's the same color as the flames whitcrystal oil produces... Which means...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Babahlese ink is a product of whitcrystal oil. And when lit, the ink produces a green flame.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmph. I believe the time has come to clip the Yatagarasu's other wing.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ms. Shih-na... You're the fake Yatagarasu...! The one who killed my father!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's about time you came clean, Agent Shih-na. Or should I say... ...Calisto Yew!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... You're not serious, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do I look like the joking type to you?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Ahah. Phwwwh... "Calisto Yew"? I've never heard that name before in my life.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That manner of speaking, and that attitude...! You haven't changed a bit in seven years!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">You're the defense attorney that killed Mr. Faraday, and then tried to frame me for it!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Oh really, and you have proof? You insist that I am this "Calisto Yew" woman, but you can't prove it! If you have no proof, then I'm afraid you won't be able to lay a single finger on me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The raven is a very unique bird, one that flies by the darkness of night. However! The light of dawn has arrived, and it will reveal your true, ugly form to the world!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Enough poetry! I want to see some evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Do you really have something that can prove that she is Calisto Yew?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I do. It's something that the 2nd Yatagarasu has preserved for us these last seven years!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Do me the honor, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will, Kay. For we have finally come to the end. We'll prove her to be Calisto Yew with this, and clip this Yatagarasu's wings for good!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">......... Don't waste my time with garbage. Now go throw it out in the trash can in the hallway!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Haaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! I thought you said you weren't the joking type, yet here you are telling jokes! But I'm not laughing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... That piece of evidence I saved for all these years... I think you can prove that Ms. Shih-na is really Calisto Yew if you use it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, you're right. It's time we brought this case from seven years ago to a close!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This perfume... This will prove you to be Calisto Yew.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">It will...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay has preserved it perfectly for us. Surely you remember this bottle? This belonged to Ms. Yew just before she disappeared seven years ago. Naturally, this means that a few of her fingerprints are on here as well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This is that bottle of perfume you spilled, which I have preserved ever since.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I heard from my father, Byrne Faraday... ...that if stored under the right conditions, a fingerprint can be preserved for decades. Which means that your fingerprints are still on here. Every last one.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We can clear everything up if we were to compare the prints on this to your own! Now come, Agent Shih-na! Will you submit yourself to a fingerprint test!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...Ahah.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Hee... hee hee hee... Ahah. Ahah! Ahah! Ahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</line>
<line speaker="???">It looks like... you've seen right through me yet again... Ahah... You're sending the biggest chill down my spine, Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Calisto... Yew...!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">So you've shown your true face at last.</line>
<line speaker="Yew">This feeling of thrill... it's even greater than that time, seven years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Shih-na! You're...!</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Lang, I really enjoyed our days together. You're an insanely strong, nice, kind-hearted... idiot of a man.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">So, you were a spy all along? A mole sent by the smuggling ring I've been chasing after... Someone who has been feeding them intel on Interpol all this time!?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Ahah! Very good! Maybe you're not as big of an idiot as I thought!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Calisto Yew... The woman who killed my father seven years ago...! You're her, aren't you!? The fake Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Yew">That's right. Calisto Yew... That's just one of my many names. But even that is just a façade. .........Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I am... the Great Thief Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Calisto Yew, this time you won't escape, for this is the end of the road for you. Now come along quietly!</line>
<line speaker="Yew">You know, you're the one who left the strongest impression on me... Kay Faraday. And had you not used the Yatagarasu's gadgets, I might've never known who you were. But here you are, being a thorn in my side... just like your father always was.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay! Don't!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yew! I'll never forgive you for what you did to my father!</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Phwwwh... You really are just like him. Mr. Faraday, too, possessed such laughable honesty!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Aaaaaaah! You let Kay go right now, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You despicable...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let go of me! You filthy... Arngh!</line>
<line speaker="Yew">You think I'm a fake, don't you? Well, unfortunately for you, I'm the real Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But that's impossible! My father was the one who created Little Thief!</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Ahaha! Hey, Edgeworth. The Yatagarasu has three legs. Do you know why that is?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why it has three legs...?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">There are three main reasons why the Yatagarasu will always be one step ahead! First! The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. Second! The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, it can't be!</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Did you finally figure it out? Do you finally know the real identity of the Yatagarasu!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The real identity of the Yatagarasu is...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Byrne Faraday, he was the real Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">If you're naming Mr. Faraday as the Yatagarasu... ...you're basically wiping out every single argument you made tonight!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh! Th-That wasn't my intention!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! If everything we've talked about tonight is nothing more than filler... ...then go home, pretty boy! You're not needed around here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnnghrrk! <thought>Agent Lang is correct. If Mr. Faraday really was the Yatagarasu... ...then that fact alone would cause a slew of contradictions. The real identity of the Yatagarasu... I must think it through one more time, for within the answer lies the truth!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Calisto Yew is the real Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth! .........Didn't we just talk about this? Ms. Yew said it herself that she's the real one, so you don't need to say it again...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I suppose not. <thought>What in the world am I doing!? I need to calm down and think this through with a level head. The real identity of the Yatagarasu is something no one has yet to guess correctly!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The real identity of the Yatagarasu is neither Byrne Faraday nor Calisto Yew. But by the same token, they are also both the real Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Ha ha! How very perceptive of you!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">N-No way!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The single person known as the Great Thief Yatagarasu never existed.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! I... No! I refuse to believe this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Yatagarasu is known to have three special skills. Skill number one. The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. And a lawyer would have the opportunity to learn the layout of client corporations. Skill number two. The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system. And a good prosecutor would be well-versed in the ways of a criminal.</line>
<line speaker="???">And skill number three... The Yatagarasu doesn't have leave a single shred of evidence behind... ever...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">D-Detective Badd!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...It was only natural for the Yatagarasu to never leave evidence behind. Because the lead detective on the case... hid it all away...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Y-You're the third member of the Yatagarasu!?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Yew. ...I've been looking for you for a long time. Seven long years, but I've finally got you...</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Ahah! Why, Mr. Badd! Long time no see. What happened to us? We used to be such a great team.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If you were such a great team, then why did you kill my father seven years ago!?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Ha ha ha. Why indeed? It was nothing personal, really. He was just another person I had to kill.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...! How can you say that...!?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">I grow weary of this, and it's about time for everything to come to an end. And this time, I won't miss.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Stop!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Yeeeeeeeeew!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">It's over, Shih-na.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Y...! Your leg...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang!</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Grrrnk!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">You idiot...! What were you thinking, jumping in front of my gun like that...!? What are you risking your life for!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I'm sorry, Detective Badd, but no matter what sort of past she may have had... ...or even if she is a spy, it doesn't change the fact that she is my subordinate. And as long as she is, I can't allow any harm to come to her, not even from you!</line>
<line speaker="Yew">You really are... an idiot, you know that...?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! That's fine with me. You should know by now that this is just how I am. Hey, sis...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Yes...?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I want you to conduct a full body search. Shih-na might have another weapon on her.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Alright. Detective Gumshoe, your assistance, please.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Sir!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, I found something! What is this, sir? It looks like the blade of a knife, but it doesn't have a handle.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is a great find, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh? It is, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's try pairing up this blade with this handle.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn>></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now then, let's try combining the blade with this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">.........Umm, I don't think you can combine that with the blade, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How dare you speak out of turn!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, wow! It looks like you can be wrong sometimes, too, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>H-How mortifying to have her point that out in front of everyone...! It shouldn't be that hard. I just need to calm down and think clearly about this. This blade can really only be paired up with that piece of evidence!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe this blade actually belongs with the handle that was on the murder weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, they fit together perfectly!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This blade must've been taken from the crime scene when the knife handles were switched.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I'm going to go return this Babahlese knife now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Alright. I trust that you'll make sure that it is returned to Ambassador Palaeno.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe this makes it perfectly clear who did it, Calisto Yew! For the only time the handles could've been switched is just after Mr. Coachen's murder.</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Ahah...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Which means that you must be Mr. Coachen's killer! You killed Mr. Coachen with the Allebahstian knife... ...switched the handles, and then took the original blade of the Babahlese knife with you. Later, you allowed yourself to be spotted by Kay near the open-air stage. You used the fireplace to lose her, and then you went back to accuse her of the murder. Does that about sum it up?</line>
<line speaker="Yew"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Yew">Ahah... You craft an engaging tale, Edgeworth, but there are two problems with it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Problems? In what respect?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Why do you think my real reason was in allowing her to chase after me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Phwwh... It was all so I could capture Kay Faraday.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">When I saw you using that device at Gatewater Land, I knew right away... ...that you were Byrne Faraday's daughter. Aha! I became curious, so I researched a little into your background. That's how I found out that you were on the trail of the Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So that's why you tried to pin Mr. Coachen's murder on me?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Yes... I knew you would show up at this embassy tonight. So I thought to use you. But pinning the murder on you wasn't my only goal.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You had another?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Heh heh, yes. Once I had you under arrest, I had planned to search you... ...and take back the device that rightfully belongs to me, the true Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You were going to take Little Thief away from me!?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Seven years ago, it was thanks to that device that Faraday was able to infiltrate this place. But he stole more than he should've. I had a tough time recovering that precious Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, the person who stole the Yatagarasu's Key was Mr. Faraday...!?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Yew... That incident seven years ago... What was the catalyst behind it?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">In the eyes of the smuggling ring, the Yatagarasu was becoming a bit of a problem. ...It wasn't an especially pleasent assignment.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then why!? Why did you become a member of the Yatagarasu!?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Why? There is no "why". I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">From the beginning? What is that supposed to mean?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">The person I take orders from hasn't changed... Even now, to this day.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! <thought>Does this mean that the leader of the smuggling ring wasn't Mr. Coachen? Then... the real ringleader is still out there pulling the strings!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Are you done asking what you need to know? Because if so, we should probably get going. And you're going to tell me everything you did tonight. Do you understand, Shih-na?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">I guess I should tell you, then, that I was the one who set the Babahlese Embassy on fire.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And why did you do that?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Ahah... I suppose it was to destroy all evidence of the counterfeit bills.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That was what the smuggling ring was trying to do...? But then, why start two fires!?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Sorry, but I can't tell you anything about the ring. It's your job to complete your investigation, after all. I've had my fun. Now, it's your turn to enjoy the ride.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Wait! Ye... I mean, Ms. Shih-na.</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">When I fell to the floor earlier, these fell at my feet.</line>
<line speaker="Yew">What about them...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">They're such pretty hair sticks that I thought... well, that I should return them to you.</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Ha ha... You can have them. They're of no use to me anymore. If you don't want them, you can always just throw them away.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">.........No, I want to keep them.</line>
<line speaker="Yew">Ahah... Suit yourself. .........Oh, that's right. I almost forgot, Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm...?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">About the second problem I had with your story... I didn't kill anyone tonight.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What...?</line>
<line speaker="Yew">I'm not saying that as a sore loser. Think of it as a hint, if you will.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, Agent Lang?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mark my words, I'm not done here, and I'll be back! And it's got nothing to do with duty or anything, because this has become my personal case. I may have been shot... ...but I'll show you just how dangerous a wounded wolf can be!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>His anger appears to have negated the sensation of pain in his injured leg...</thought> It's finally over, Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I feel like I've peered into her heart a little, you know? And it's so cold, and dark... and incredibly lonely. The person who was giving her all these commands... ...the one who thought my father was a problem to be removed...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That person is the real ringleader behind the smuggling ring!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Um, Mr. Edgeworth, I have a favor to ask. Can you... hold onto these hair sticks for me? They're really pretty, just like the ones they were selling for the Jammin' Ninja show... ...but until this case is over, I don't think I can look at them without being overcome.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I understand. I'll take good care of them for you. <thought>Hm...? There is a bit of soil stuck on the ends of these sticks...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The design of these things are rather eccentric for hair sticks...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? Really? Well, if they're THAT strange, what should I do with them?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... <thought>I have to say, these are by far the most bizarre hair sticks I have ever seen.</thought> ...In any case, Kay, there's something I've been meaning to ask. How exactly do you stick that hair stick of yours into your hair like that?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">! That's............ a secret!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Curiouser and curiouser...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey! Take a look at this, Mr. Edgeworth! There's dirt on here! It's totally ruining the beauty of the hair stick!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose... <thought>Why is there dirt stuck on the end of a hair stick in the first place?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Oh! I guess it's that time already, huh!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">So it's midnight... the dawn of another day.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, pops! Thanks a bunch! You've really done a lot for everyone all these years!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Badd, don't tell me today is the day...?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Yeah... it is. With this... I can retire in peace. ...It was down to the wire, and we almost didn't make it... ...but we did it... we solved everything.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But that's just it; we haven't solved everything yet. The ringleader of the smuggling ring you, the Yatagarasu, were chasing after...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...The legend of that Yatagarasu... is now over. Mr. Edgeworth... That bit of logic earlier... it was brilliant.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">I feel like... I can leave it all in your hands. ...I'm counting on you.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Is it really true, Uncle Badd? Were you also a part of the Yatagarasu...?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">As I said to you earlier... Kay... I'm truly sorry. I wanted... nothing but a peaceful life for you...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Uncle Badd...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hey, don't take it so seriously! It's all just one big joke, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Unfortunately, it isn't.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">O-Oh, come on, sir! She's just yanking on my chain, isn't she, Mr. Edgeworth!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Badd... Wait, no, you are no longer a detective... Mr. Badd, I'd like to ask you about the Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Mr. Edgeworth... ...Here, I should give these back to you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These are... ...the pages from my KG-8 case files that the Yatagarasu stole from my office!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh? Wait? WHAT!?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Mr. Edgeworth, I must apologize for last night.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So the Yatagarasu who stole into my room was you, was it?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wait... then that means... WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? T-Tell me it's not true...! Th-That's too insane for me to believe, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">It's true... Even if it's not something you want to hear. The KG-8 Incident... It was a very emotionally trying case. We stood in that courtroom... Faraday as the prosecutor... and I as the lead detective. Faraday had... evidence in his possession... that would prove the defendant guilty. However... because it was stolen, the defendant... was found innocent. Yew was... the elder sister... of the victim in the case. When the defendant was pronounced "not guilty"... she... let out a great wail. That's when we realized... that there was a limit... to what the law could do. The only way to bring someone like that to justice was to do so outside of the courts... That's what we thought... at the time. ...That's how we... formed the Yatagarasu... ...and vowed to bring to light... any dirty dealings companies had with the ring... ...including companies that dealt with... the Amano Group...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Amano's conglomerate...?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">We called ourselves the Yatagarasu... and flexed our collective muscle... We exposed all sorts of shady dealings... as a warning to the business world as a whole... By doing that... we were able to stop... the higher ups from covering things up. And then... it was finally time... We had finally arrived at the moment when... we'd find out the ringleader's true identity. It was then that Yew literally stabbed us in the heart... and Faraday... he died for it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..................</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But why...? Wasn't she the sister of the victim in the KG-8 Incident?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...After Faraday's death, I looked into her past... And that's when I found out... that she was a phony. The victim of the KG-8 Incident, Cece Yew... ...she ...never had a sister.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What? Then that means...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">"Shih-na" wasn't the only fake name she used! "Calisto Yew" was also another pseudonym! From the very beginning... that woman was a spy sent by the smuggling ring!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">She said it herself; "I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning."</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Anyway... Let's return to the real topic at hand... Mr. Edgeworth... this "trump card" that we stuck onto this page of the case file... ...please use it wisely.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"Trump card"...?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">That photo that we stuck on there... Try peeling it off. Behind it... slumbers a piece of evidence... that Faraday hid away all those years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the mark of the Yatagarasu... But why?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">This is... a "directives card"... from the big boss. Take a look... at the back. This was something... Coachen had on him at the time of the KG-8 Incident... ten years ago. That blood... is from the victim of the incident, Ms. Cece Yew...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But why is the card adorned with the mark of the Yatagarasu?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">The reason why... we called ourselves... the Yatagarasu... ...was because... of the three-legged raven mark that the smuggling ring's boss used. Apparently, orders from the boss... would come on these cards, without fail. The person who received the order... was supposed to burn it immediately after reading it. And apparently... it burns a bright green flame when set ablaze...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you mean, the cards were written in Babahlese ink...?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">The fact that the card that Coachen was sent made it into Faraday's hand at all... ...is nothing short of a miracle. We decided... that whenever we stole anything... ...we would sent a "card" along with it... to the police.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So that's what those white cards are!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">The Great Thief that used the mark... that only those within the ring would know... It was our message... to the ringleader... ...that we were only a few steps behind.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">And one more thing... Detective Gumshoe. I'm entrusting this to you.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What is this, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">This is what I was talking about earlier. During the KG-8 Incident trial, Faraday had this in his possession... ...this important, definitive piece of evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But I thought it was stolen, How do you have it...?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">The person who stole it from us... ten years ago... ..was a man by the name of Ernest Amano... And he had it locked and hidden away... for all this time. But we forced him to tell us where it was finally... after the other day's kidnapping case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This video...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The KG-8 Incident... This was the case in which the unwitting Cece Yew was murdered... ...when she was to expose the connection between the Amano Group and the smuggling ring. This was also when the group, the Yatagarasu, was first formed. Are the events of this case connected to that case from ten years ago somehow...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This blood belongs to Detective Faith, who was killed in my office by Mr. Portsman. Sadly, it would appear that he was partnered with anyone but a good prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Portsman">Wh--! Don't come any closer! I'm warning you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the same video as the one Mr. Portsman was trying to conceal from me!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Yeah, it would seem that even he was caught up in the ring's web. Amano was preparing to take on the boss someday... ...and the video was his insurance. That's where that prosecutor comes in... He was to retrieve the video. On top of that... he was apparently instructed to sneak into your office... ...and steal the trump card... You saw it for yourself, right? The card that told him to preserve the evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, that card was not the calling card of the Yatagarasu... ...but rather, a directives card from the ringleader to Mr. Portsman?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">The two pieces together make for a strong weapon for whoever holds them.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The evidence Mr. Portsman thought to withhold from me... ...and the one that you stole from my office last night... Both pieces are illegal, and for me to use either one is...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Whether you use them or not... is up to you. But they will be of help to you... when you take on someone who is above the law.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is the boss one of those who "cannot be brought to court" that Mr. Faraday spoke of?</thought> Detective Badd... There is no limit to the law, for it is the people who determine the limits to them.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">You still insist that, even now? You really are something else. I leave the rest in your hands. Now then, Detective Gumshoe. The handcuffs. It's time to lock up... the last remaining member of the Yatagarasu.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Pops...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Don't ever lose your detective's spirit.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Nnnnrrrgh... Pops! Why is this happening!? This isn't justice!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Like I always told you... do not get emotionally involved. ...Now let's go.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is this really the end of a legend...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even you can't talk your way out of the contradiction this piece of evidence points out!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...I guess not.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... I knew it...</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Because I don't need to talk my way out of it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">B-But it's--!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I don't like to waste time delving into subjects that don't warrant a response.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh! <thought>It would appear that I was mistaken...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This piece of evidence of shows us the contradiction in your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">............................................................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By your silence, I assume you agree with my conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">No, I just don't have a worthy response. In any case, I have some documents I need to attend to... ............................................................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh! <thought>I guess she feels that she has no need to counter my argument...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There piece of evidence proved that there is a glaring flaw in your logic!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">...That piece of evidence and my testimony? Actually... ...it proves the absence of a flaw in my logic, and the presence of one in yours.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnrgh... <thought>I-I was mistaken?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I'll just continue with my testimony now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry... there is a major contradiction in that statement just now!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Really? Hey, Franzy! What do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I don't want to agree with you on anything, but in this case, there is no contradiction.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">See, Edgey! Even Franzy says there's no problem!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arngh! <thought>I know I'm off when they're agreeing with each other... Although it seemed as though I had him, it appears that I was the one who was had. At this rate, I will never grab a hold of truth! I must carefully listen to his testimony once more.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This piece of evidence shows the fatal flaw in your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Umm... I don't really get it. So, yeah. Can I continue with what I was saying?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">S-Sure... <thought>I guess I was wrong...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, prepare to be buried down under by this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">.........You know, Edgey, you're actually a really good guy at heart. I can't believe you'd do such a great thing for Roxanna and I!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........What are you going on about!?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">What are YOU going on about? I thought you just said... ...that you were going to berry us down under! So you're gonna chase her down with me in Australia and cover us in berries, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I said nothing of the sort! If you had been listening carefully, you would've noticed I said, "buried".</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Wait, what? Aren't they the same word? You say, "buried", I say, "berried". Tomeito, tomahto.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arrrrrnngh! <thought>He is seriously trying my patience. I don't suppose I can fool even Larry with this piece of evidence. Which means that my only option is to present a more definitive piece of evidence!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, about this piece of evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "Confidence is like a soul, and words without confidence are but empty shells." You shouldn't waste your breath on words you have no confidence in, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, it's just as bad to say something in full confidence and be wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arghn!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't need to be overflowing with self-confidence; I just need to think rationally. After all, I only need to be confident in the facts!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, if you could take a look at this piece of evidence... ...you'd see that there is a very big flaw in your logic.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Flaw? Are you sure it's not your eyes that are flawed? Talk to me again when you can see straight!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gnnrk! Maybe this wasn't the piece I was looking for after all!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That statement just now stands in contradiction to this piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That thing has nothing to do with what I was saying. Now, put it away! And your logic is so badly in need of repair that you might as well throw it out, too! This is the real deal here. Your courtroom mannerisms are worthless at a crime scene!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gnnrk...! You dare to insult the courts!?</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I'm afraid I can't entertain you any longer. You're disrupting the investigation. I'll be taking the suspect in now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, wait!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I can see no reason for me to wait.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth! As you are my subordinate, you should expect no mercy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ack! <thought>I-I've lost sight of the truth...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">If you have no counterargument, we'll be going now.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wh-What the--!? Argh! I told you, it wasn't me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! Lang Zi says: "Expect everything from a criminal." They are always up to no good, and all of their actions are suspicious. Mr. Prosecutor... I proclaim your childhood friend to be overly suspicious!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Arnnngh...!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">What the heck, man!? I told you, I didn't do a thing!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah, and you can tell it to us again nice and slow down at the precinct. Mr. Prosecutor, I had a slight bit of expectation for you... That you would keep me entertained!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gnrk!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Edgey! Say something! Tell him I'm not some sort of bad guy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nngh... B-But I... ...I have no counterargument to offer...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Haaa hahahahahahahahahaha! Glad you finally realized that! Now then, I believe his welcome brigade will be here shortly. Let's go!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Edgeeeey!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Arngh! Is this all I could do for him...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Well, it's getting late... Why don't you go on home and get some rest? I think we can do without a prosecutor who's just playing around, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh--!? I'm not doing anything of the sort!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hmph... You may not be trying to, but the way I see it, that's all you're doing. And I don't think I can swallow any more of you messing up my turf. Now get out of here and go home.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Arngh! Is this all I could do...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">What are you two doing here? I can't allow you to conduct any unauthorized investigating.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But we're investigating under the same authority!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">Interpol has already finished a full investigation into this area. At best, what you two are doing is wasting your time. At worst, I'm afraid you could be tampering with the crime scene. Therefore, I'm commanding you to vacate the area at once.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But we're not doing anything wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Shih-na">I will not make any exceptions for you. Now come, you will leave at once.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Nngh! Is this the best I could do...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Sorry, but any more time we spend discussing this would just be a waste. And I'm afraid I'm going to have to take you off of the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W-Wait a second!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "Persistence soon turns into fixation." You're so set on your logic being right that you've lost your objectivity. Investigations require that we be flexible and open-minded... Just like yours truly! So give it up, and go home!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Nngh! Could I do no better!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's nothing unusual about this area.</line>
