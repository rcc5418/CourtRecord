<title>The Adventure of the Runaway Room</title>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Amazing... Is...is this really just a railway station?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Railway station or not, I've never seen such an enormous building before.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And look at all the steam locomotives. This country is incredible.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Wah... I feel like...like I'm dreaming.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this...is the capital of Great Britain... </line>
<line speaker="Man">So...where to?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, hello!</line>
<line speaker="Man">Climb aboard. I'll take you wherever you want to go.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">In that case, um...the Supreme Court in Whitehall, if you wouldn't mind.</line>
<line speaker="Man">My pleasure. I suppose you're...visiting students from abroad, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Man">Thought so. Well then, I hope you enjoy your stay. And welcome...to the centre of the world: Great Britain's mighty capital, London!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">These are the Scales of Justice. They're a symbol of the defence, aren't they?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, that's right. The scales are a symbol of fairness, to show that all are treated equally in the eyes of the law. And they're a warning to those who enter the courtroom without an impartial mind. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But if they're the mark of the defence... ...it would be more auspicious if they were weighing more heavily on the 'not guilty' side, I think. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Very impartial, I'm sure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The lawyer's name is embroidered on the inside here, look. 'Kazuma Asogi'... This was his band, of course. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">He had his heart set on this study tour in Great Britain. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sure he would have found the truth he longed for here. <thought>...But he lost his life before he even had the chance to see the place.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I have such a strong sense of his hopes and dreams when I look at this armband, though.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...What an incredible place!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's so...imposing. It's, it's almost suffocating...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This place is breathtaking...! It looks like a fortress!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">There are some stone buildings like this in Japan now, of course. But they've only been built in the few short decades since we opened our borders to the outside world. An authentic example like this has quite a different impact, wouldn't you agree? A far cry from the wood and paper most of our buildings are constructed from. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's certainly...unfamiliar... <thought>...But I think there's more to the differences than just construction materials...</thought> What is this place again...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This is the Lord Chief Justice's office, Naruhodo-san. In the Supreme Court of Great Britain.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The Lord Chief Justice...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We had instructions to report here at this time. If...circumstances were different... ...we were supposed to let the Lord Chief Justice know that we had arrived from Japan. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... But Kazuma can't. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">No... So instead, we are here in a different capacity. As envoys, to report the news of Kazuma-sama's death. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And having delivered his or her message, an envoy's duty is done. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So...we'd have to return to Japan.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">If we want to remain here in Great Britain...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I have to take Kazuma's place as the law student selected for the study tour. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. Which means you need the requisite qualifications as a lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Which is what I've been studying for. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Here in Great Britain, it is the Lord Chief Justice who appoints lawyers. So that's the second reason why we're here. To have you officially recognised as a lawyer. It's the only way that we'll be able to remain here in London. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>I hope I'm up to scratch...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="???">I trust you aren't too exhausted after your long voyage from Japan? Hmph. It seems I'm one hour, twelve minutes and... forty-seven seconds late. My apologies. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! No no. Don't mention it! We're never happier than when we're standing around with nothing much to do!</line>
<line speaker="???">...How fortunate. </line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">So, introductions... I am Mael Stronghart, Lord Chief Justice of the British Empire. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh... And I feel like a little mouse under an elephant's foot...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Come on, Mr Naruhodo! Don't be a mouse!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, um... It's, it's an honour to meet you, Lord Chief Justice Stronghart! I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo from the Empire of Japan!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Well, Mr Naruhodo... Welcome to London! The capital of our glorious British Empire!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...yes... Thank you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Just look at all the knotty books packed together on these shelves! They go from floor to ceiling!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And they're all books that you couldn't hope to come by in Japan. It's like a dream!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...a very bad dream.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">They're not all about British law, either. There are books about the judicial systems of other Western nations. France, Germany, Spain, Holland...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What about Russia?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Why do you ask?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I was wondering about asking the Lord Chief Justice how you say 'wardrobe' in Russian. What do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I think, perhaps, it's a thought best abandoned.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at these menacing metal giants facing each other across the room!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I believe they're... Yes, they're suits of armour.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, right... I thought maybe they were like the lion-dogs we have in Japan guarding shrine gates.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No, not at all. In fact, in Europe, suits of armour like these are always possessed by evil spirits, you know. And they roam around in the middle of the night.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? ...Is there nothing you don't know, Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This book tells me everything I need to know about everything. If you're ever unsure, just ask!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Where did she get that incredible tome?!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is this...some kind of clock?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Actually, I, I think we might be INSIDE some sort of giant clock. But those gears are larger than anything you'd find on a steam locomotive, even!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's...eerie. Do you think clocks are some sort of hobby of his? The Lord Chief Justice, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, boys do enjoy fiddling around with machines, don't they?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm not sure you could 'fiddle' with cogs that size! And I'm certain you couldn't call him a 'boy'! <thought>Still, it's amazing how little noise the cogs make, considering how large they are. There's actually something quite soothing about their precise rhythm...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">This must be the Lord Chief Justice's desk. I believe it's made of marble.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It looks more like an over-the-top tombstone that's toppled over to me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think that's your fanciful imagination at work again, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It feels like everything that's normally made of wood and paper at home... ...is made of bricks and stone here.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I know. That's why this place feels so overbearing, I'm sure.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">So...what are your impressions of our capital so far? How do you like London?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Um, well...erm... <thought>Help! I've been so nervous ever since I got here that I can't remember a single thing about the city!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's simply splendid! ...Isn't it, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We had a wonderful view of some of London's streets from the carriage on the way here from the station. Everything is so...impressive and...grand! I must say I'm almost lost for words. </line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I'm glad to hear you like it. The city boasts tramways, piped water and gas - even cables supplying electricity. We spearhead every revolutionary new technology in the world. Every visitor to London is astounded. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes! Astounded is the word!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Thanks for saving me there, Susato-san...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">And everyone seems so jolly and full of vigour!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Yes. There's much excitement about the upcoming Great Exhibition we will be hosting here in London. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Great Exhibition...?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Cultural and technological achievements from around the globe are to be exhibited here in our great city. It will be the greatest spectacle of its kind in history. ...And will make Paris's World Fair look like a toy shop!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Gosh! I can hardly imagine how magnificent it's going to be!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Great Britain's capital city is nothing but magnificent! London is the centre of the modern world!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Even if you do say so yourself...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The sun will never set on our great empire! Perhaps it is fate that in these progressive times, we welcome visitors from the Land of the Rising Sun.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...Lord Chief Justice... ...I think you were expecting a student of law for this study tour, weren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Absolutely. A Mr Kazuma Asogi, if my memory serves. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. </line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The British government has already been telegraphed a full report on the situation. I understand the young man lost his life aboard the steamship bound for our shores. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That's amazing! The news reached him before we even arrived...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...My country naturally extends its deepest condolences to yours. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...thank you. </line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And you honoured this appointment specifically to inform me of the news?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Yes. We are here in the capacity of envoys from Japan to report the sad news in person. </line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">They tell me you Japanese are a people of protocol and courtesy, and I see that it's true. ...And it is with some regret that I must inform you... ...that the death of the young lawyer means this study tour arrangement can no longer proceed. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">If you would just hear us out, Lord Stronghart. </line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...What do you have to say, madam?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's about the study tour... Mr Naruhodo here would like to make a proposal. </line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Would he now? Well, Mr Naruhodo...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This is it, then. The moment of truth...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The thing is, Lord Justice, erm... Lord Stronghart... I was wondering if perhaps you would consider allowing the study tour to go ahead?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Don't misunderstand me. Britain would ideally like to see the tour go ahead. But without a lawyer from your country, there's nothing to be done. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, in that case... ...what if there was someone else? Another lawyer from Japan, I mean. </line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... ...Is there something I don't know?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Only a single lawyer was invited to Great Britain from your country. And that was Mr Asogi. ...At least, that is what I've been led to understand. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, um, the thing is... <thought>This really isn't going well at all. I just can't seem to find the right words to say to this man!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I could ruin things here if I'm not careful! What am I going to say?</thought> ...If there is someone else here from Japan who could be described as a lawyer, it's...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>It's only been forty days since Kazuma died. And yes, I've studied as hard as I possibly could. But can I really stand before this terrifying man and claim that I can do the job?</thought> Sorry. I, I don't know what I was thinking. Of course only one lawyer...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh, but I'm not sure if I can stand before this terrifying woman and claim that I can't! I'll end up upside-down on the floor if I do that. ......... Not that I'm scared of a Susato Takedown, obviously. But still, perhaps I should change my answer...</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It...can probably only be... Yes! Miss Susato!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">An unusual introduction. But I presume you mean this charming lady besides you. You're a lawyer, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That look she's giving me... After all the days of hard work she put in to help me study... ...I can't let her down now!</thought> I, I think that's quite enough joking...don't you, Lord Stronghart? My real answer is...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's me. I can do it!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Is that so?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I mean, I don't actually have any qualifications as such, but... </line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">No qualifications, you say? And yet you still claim to be a lawyer?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I have acted as a lawyer in court before! ...Only once, as it happens. <thought>And I had Kazuma to help me AND I was the accused! But glossing over the details...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I've been spending every spare moment on the journey here to Great Britain studying. I've learnt all about British law and court proceedings while I was on board the SS Burya. </line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The voyage from Japan is some fifty days, I believe. Not what you might call a full education. To become a qualified lawyer here in Britain... ...not only do  you need a university degree in law, you must also complete several years of training. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I realise it's far too short a period of time. But...I can't just go back to Japan.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma- Mr Asogi's journey had only just begun! Coming here on this study tour was all he thought about! I have to carry on and do everything he planned to do!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know it must sound like I have an overly inflated opinion of myself. But I would do anything to prove that I have what it takes. Any test you care to set me. Just one chance... That's all I'm asking for. Please!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Hm, thirty-one seconds.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Your opening statement there, Mr Naruhodo. It was thirty-one seconds long. Not too brief, not too protracted. A perfectly judged appeal, I would say. ...Which is a skill that would stand you in good stead as a lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh. Thanks.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">So, you're willing to put those words to trial, are you? Well, I'm all for entertainment.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">But let me ask you one thing first...sir.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Y-Yes...?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You say you intend to do everything Mr Asogi planned to do. ...Are you firmly set on that path?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...yes. That's my intention.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Am I imagining things... ...or did his expression just alter a fraction there all of a sudden?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Very well. You have your wish. I'll give you a chance. A test to become a specially certified lawyer. Whether you pass or fail is entirely down to you. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...what form will the test take exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Tell me, Mr Naruhodo, what do you consider the role of a lawyer to be?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, defending people, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Well said. So...let's have you defend someone.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Your timing is perfect, in fact. There's an apt trial about to begin later today. No advocate has been appointed for the defence as yet, so this will be welcome news. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">T-Today...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Straight away...?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">If you manage to secure a verdict of not guilty, you'll have passed my test. What could be simpler?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh...how do I get myself into these situations?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, could I ask...what sort of trial is it, Lord Stronghart?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Hm, yes, good question. ...Ah, I remember. It's a murder trial.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">A murder?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">An extremely simple case, I understand. You really can't lose.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That's easy to say...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">But I should mention, just in case... ...if the defendant is found guilty, he will of course be sentenced to capital punishment.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Capital punishment?! <thought>He'll, he'll be put to death?!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Here in Great Britain, murderers are sent to the gallows without exception. Presumably you read that much in your short sea-based introduction to British law?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We, we can't possibly agree to such a test! We would be toying...with a man's life!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I am the Lord Chief Justice. And I've decided it's acceptable.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But... <thought>You can't do that! ...Can you?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">There's not need to overcomplicate this. All you have to do is ensure that you don't lose.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>So the defendant may live or die depending on how well I perform in court? If I lose... ...he'll be hanged...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Mr Naruhodo! You've come to me claiming to be a lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">If you want me to take you seriously, you need to prove you're willing to do a lawyer's job. And you say you intend to see through the will of your compatriot, Mr Asogi. ...I would like to understand just how far you're willing to go in order to make that happen.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>He's testing my resolve...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...What's the matter? You've fallen silent. I'm sorry, but time is pressing. The trial begins shorty. I need an answer from you now. ...What's it to be?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>...What do I say? Do I agree to this absurd test?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright then, if I have to give you a decision now, my answer is...is... <thought>I can't do it! I can't get the words out!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Fifteen seconds. Hm, your decision making needs work if you want to be a lawyer. That was too slow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">So, it's as I suspected, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You have noble intentions, but lack the resolve to see them through.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The test is cancelled. Thank you for stopping by. Go and acquire your ticket for passage back to the East tomorrow. This conversation is over.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Yes, Lord Stronghart. Thank you for offering me a chance.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sorry, Miss Susato. But what could I do?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's alright. I understand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You do?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's not an easy decision to choose whether to defend a man in these circumstances. But resolve has absolutely nothing to do with it.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...What are you trying to say, madam?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I think what Miss Susato means... ...is that no matter how badly I'd like to be recognised as a lawyer and stay here in Great Britain... ...to risk another man's life by treating his one and only chance at a trial so trivially... ...would be utterly unforgivable! And I feel exactly the same way.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sure the defendant won't see this trial as a test. As some kind of experiment.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A lawyer may fight for his clients in court day after day. But for each one of those clients... ...the particular day they stand in the dock may be the only chance they have to fight to prove their innocence. No, I was wrong. I'm not qualified to do that job yet. I'm sorry for wasting your precious time, Lord Chief Justice.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Lord Stronghart, may I show you this?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">To accept this item, issue a receipt, examine it thoroughly and make a formal statement of my findings... ...would require something in the region of twenty-four seconds of my time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Does the item warrant twenty-four seconds of my time, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Let's leave it for now.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Wait, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! ...Was there something else?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">It's approximately twenty minutes by carriage to the Old Bailey from here. If you leave immediately, you should still be there in time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but I just said that...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I was quite serious in what I told you. The defendant in this case has literally no one to advocate for him.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">At this point, he can't hope to find someone to represent him. The trial will begin without a defence. And if that happens, there's only one possible outcome. He will receive the most severe sentence the judge can pass down.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But that's awful!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">But that is the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Why does it have to be like this?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Please don't expect an answer to every question.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The cold, hard truth of the matter... ...is that there is only one person now with a chance to save this man from a very miserable end. And that is you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>I'm really his only hope?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">So... ...what do you say now, madam?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Me? What do you mean, Lord Stronghart?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You said it wasn't an easy decision to choose whether to defend a man in these circumstances. And I agree. But in my estimation...it is purely and simply a matter of resolve.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Our time is up here. I have a meeting to attend. I must leave in two minutes and sixteen seconds. So! Venture into our great city and enjoy yourselves!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He's gone...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm, the Old Bailey...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If we're going to do this, Mr Naruhodo, we must leave at once!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato, can I just ask you something?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Careful! From this position, I can perform a Susato Takedown in an instant. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I know.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo, you heard Lord Stronghart. The trial starts imminently. If I need to throw you, I will!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>You know, you could just say, 'I think we should hurry to the courtroom.'</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">If you need to ask me anything, it had better wait until we're at the Old Bailey.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato, can I just ask you something?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Careful! From this position, I can perform a Susato Takedown in an instant. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I know.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo, you heard Lord Stronghart. The trial starts imminently. If I need to throw you, I will!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>You know, you could just say, 'I think we should hurry to the courtroom.'</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">If you need to ask me anything, it had better wait until we're at the Old Bailey.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato, can I just ask you something?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Careful! From this position, I can perform a Susato Takedown in an instant. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I know.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo, you heard Lord Stronghart. The trial starts imminently. If I need to throw you, I will!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>You know, you could just say, 'I think we should hurry to the courtroom.'</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">If you need to ask me anything, it had better wait until we're at the Old Bailey.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, thank goodness, we're in time. There's still fifteen minutes until the trial begins. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I never knew a horse-drawn carriage could go so fast! I thought my teeth were going to rattle loose!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Did you hear what I said to the driver when we climbed aboard? 'Get us to our destination in five minutes, driver, and there's a guinea in it for you!' It's one of my favourite lines from the Herlock Sholmes stories! And it worked quite perfectly!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm not sure why you're so pleased. I thought we were going to die, AND we had to pay gold for the privilege.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, at least we arrived here before the trial started. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...I suppose there's that.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Anyway, I don't understand it. The court clerk said the defendant should be here... ...but there's no sign of him at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So this is the Old Bailey... Even this room for defendants to wait in is grand.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm feeling tense, that's all. This place gives me the same sense of foreboding that I remember from the Supreme Court in Japan. An oppresive air... Almost as if the building itself is going to crush whoever is about to be sentenced. <thought>It feels like only yesterday that I was the one about to be crushed...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, whoever the man you're to defend is, I imagine he's feeling very alone at this moment...</line>
<line speaker="???">...Top of the mornin' to ya, madam! ...Sir. What are youse doin', followin' me here? Tings are fair desperate, are they?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="???">Would ya look at those expressionless faces. From the East, are youse?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...we're from Japan, yes.</line>
<line speaker="???">Ah, Japan, is it? Right, say no more! So? How much do youse need?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no, we're here because-</line>
<line speaker="???">No need to explain, fella. I've been there meself, so I have. No place to go! Nuttin' to eat! Barely a penny to your name! And all while in a strange, faraway land!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, actually... Haah... We haven't found a place to stay yet, no. </line>
<line speaker="???">'Tis grand, 'tis grand! Let me start by givin' youse a thousand guineas. Say nuttin' now!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">A, a thousand guineas?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please, Miss Susato! You don't have to shout.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But a thousand guineas is... ...is enough to build an entire mansion in the most prestigious area of Tokyo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">WHAAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="???">'Tis nuttin' to me at all. I like to ensure I have sufficient funds to weather a rainy day, you see. I've enough wealth to buy the city of London two or three times over. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Could that much rain even fall in one day?</thought> Well even so, we couldn't possibly accept such a large sum of money... Agh! <thought>That hit me in the eye!</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">...Don't get me wrong, fella. I'm not givin' it ya 'no strings attached'. I'll be wantin' you to do sometin' for me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="???">To be honest, 'tis a little embarrassin'. The trial that's about to begin, you see, is for me good self here. I'll be in the dock. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="???">So now, what I want you to do... ...is come along with me and stand there beside me. Officially, you'd be my lawyer, but...that's just a little detail now. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, well, the thing is-</line>
<line speaker="???">Don't worry about a ting! All you have to do, is stand up there next to me. Nuttin' more. Otherwise, you see... ...the trial is goin' to start without me havin' any kind of representation at all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So it was true. The Lord Chief Justice wasn't just making it all up.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Um...I'm terribly sorry to have to ask, but... ...does that mean you're the defendant in this trial?</line>
<line speaker="???">......... Blusterin' blazes! Do youse...? Do youse not know I am? Me? One of London's biggest names?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No. Sorry. We've only just arrived in the city, you see. </line>
<line speaker="???">Hm...I see... I s'pose it isn't altogether impossible. Well, just next to Hyde Park there in the centre of London is another beautiful park. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? A park? What?</line>
<line speaker="???">'Tis called McGilded Park. Full of blossomin' flowers in the spring and singin' birds and whatnot. I donated it to the city, so I did!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">An, an entire park? In central London?!</line>
<line speaker="???">'A city of smiles', that's my vision for London. </line>
<line speaker="McGilded">There's nuttin' Magnus McGilded wouldn't do for the city and its quare old people!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's...amazing. I mean, really extraordinary!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Ah, but! Now they've the gall to say I'm a good-for-nuttin' criminal! Me! Magnus McGilded! What is the matter with the London police, I ask ya? Hahh...hahh...hahh...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Alright, don't pass out...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo... Perhaps now would be a good time to introduce ourselves, while the gentleman catches his breath. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Good idea.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Hahh...hahh...hahh...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, Mr McGilded, the thing is... ...we're actually here in London to study British law. We're law students, on a study tour from Japan, you see. </line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Hahh...hahh...hahh...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...if you don't have a lawyer for the trial yet... ...and you'd be happy to put yourself in our hands, we'll do our best-</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">What was I after sayin', you daft eejit? I've given you a thousand guineas to stand up there next to me, haven't I?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Well yes, but I wasn't really offering to just 'stand up there next to you'...</thought></line>
<line speaker="McGilded">......... Oh, I tink I see what's goin' on here. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">I know what you're tinkin'. 'This chancer of a fella claims to have more money than the Queen. But if that's true, why the blazes can't he hire the finest lawyer in all of England? Because he did it! That's the only explanation!' ...Well?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, well...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes! Exactly! </line>
<line speaker="McGilded">What now?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, like you said, if you have all that money but you don't have anyone to represent you in court... ...there's no other logical conclusion than that you're guilty of the charges. </line>
<line speaker="McGilded">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well, you call a spade a spade in the East, so you do!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! I'm, I'm sorry. I didn't mean any offence! I still can't express myself very well in English, you see. And I'm never sure what's acceptable to say and what isn't, so...</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Is that so? Because you sounded fluent enough when you were tellin' me what a blackguard I must be. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Errrm... I'm terribly sorry. </line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Wah hah hah hah hah! I can't say that I blame ya for tinkin' it, fella! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It, it is a little strange, to be honest. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Not at all! ...Although, it is a little strange, to be honest.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why you don't have a lawyer, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">......... That would be the fault of the Reaper.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? <thought>Did he just say, 'reaper'?</thought></line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Aye, the Grim Reaper of the Bailey, Lord Barok van Zieks. He's the prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The prosecutor...is the Grim Reaper?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">When van Zieks stands for the prosecution, they call the accused his 'sacrificial lambs'. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">And to this day... ...in every single trial in which he's been the prosecutor... ...the accused has been damned!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">So it's reached the desperate situation... ...where there's no one willin' to stand in defence against the fella at all. You could say he's a living legend of the Old Bailey. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Goodness... Lord Barok van Zieks... He must be an exceptionally talented prosecutor then. </line>
<line speaker="McGilded">......... Talented isn't the word you're lookin' for, madam. ...It's 'cursed'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Cursed?! <thought>What on earth...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">The defendant is summoned! And his counsel! Please make your way into the courtroom. The trial is about to begin!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">His counsel... <thought>That would be me!</thought></line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Oh, 'tis time! Well then, fella, don't let me down! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But... But I don't know anything about the case! You haven't told me what happened!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">......... Until you showed yer face here... ...I'd made up me mind, so I had. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">I'd decided I'd have to defend meself in there!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! <thought>How would that have worked?</thought></line>
<line speaker="McGilded">But then you made an appearance. A student of law, wouldn't ya know? 'Tis no accident, I can assure ya of that. 'Tis fate. So don't get cold feet now. Please. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>I literally know nothing about the case, or about this man who stands accused. In fact, the only thing I do know... ...is that I can't just turn my back on him.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The man has no one. He'll have to stand alone in that courtroom, armed with nothing to defend himself. Yes... Something that Kazuma would never have allowed to happen. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Counsel for the Defence! What are you doing? If you're late for the start of the trial, you will lose your right to stand!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I'll be right there.<thought>It's happening, then. My first trial in a British court. I hope you're watching over me, Kazuma... ...because I have no idea how I'm going to manage this!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this is the highest court in Great Britain... The Old Bailey... The centuries of history in this place is [sic] palpable, isn't it? It's so different to the Supreme Court in Japan. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">...It feels both imposing and serene at the same time. The atmosphere almost makes words redundant. Whatever the country, determining a person's guilt or innocence is always a solemn affair. May I say something, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Yes, what?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Your eyes look ready to pop out of your head again. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know, but I just can't help it...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. We are here today to determine the guilt or innocence of Mr Magnus McGilded. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution...is fully prepared. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That must be the Reaper of the Bailey... He...really does look fully prepared to dispatch his next poor victim to the underworld...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel for the Defence, you appear to be...Eastern. Do you speak English?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh? Oh! Yes, of course! Sorry. <thought>But he asked if the defence was ready. And I couldn't be further from ready if I tried...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Those eyes please me. ...Nipponese. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">They shroud your fear, your doubt, your trepidation... They run wild, clinging to some phantom notion of courage. The quintessential look...of a sacrificial lamb. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh... A cold shiver just ran down my spine all the way to the tips of my toes...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... Now, Mr McGilded...</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Yes, My Lord?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You stand accused of murder. A capital offence. You could be sent to the gallows if found guilty. Are you quite sure you wish to entrust your defence to this...foreigner?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">......... As I've always said, My Lord, 'tis a grand ting to give opportunities to the young. Even if the fella is a student from some little island off in the Far East. Is it not the British way to ignore the dangers to yeself and give those less fortunate a fair chance? I'd like to tink that acts of chivalry do the great British Empire proud. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">It seems as though everyone in the public gallery is firmly behind Mr McGilded. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's definitely welcome news. And he certainly has a way with words. I'm surprised he couldn't convince anyone to defend him. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Eloquently put, Mr McGilded. And most laudable sentiments. Now... ...ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm sure I need hardly remind you... ...that you six members of the public have been selected for your impartiality. Are you ready to proceed?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Yes, My Lord! If the task is to send rotters to the gallows where they belong, I'm more than ready!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">At the manor, His Lordship always says we should dispose of rubbish promptly. Naturally, I agree. </line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Hah! Any criminals here will soon be wishing they never set eyes on me!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">...I feel a chill. </line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Oh, don't mind me, my dears! I'll just be getting on with my knitting. Must finish these mitts for my grandson. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, Mr Naruhodo, those people are...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The jury. Yes... That's something we don't have in Japan yet. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's right. I've only ever read about it. But here in Great Britain, the court's final verdict depends on the opinions of these six jurors. The judge passes sentence according to the law, but the jurors determine guilt based on common sense. So the defendant is ultimately judged from two completely different points of view. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But how exactly do the jurors give their verdict?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That I don't know. But... ...I'm sure it will become clear as the trial progresses. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Prosecutor van Zieks...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My Lord?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It's been a number of years since we've seen you here in the courtroom. I thought you'd renounced your fame. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I'm known as the Reaper of the Bailey, My Lord. ...Infamy rather than fame, I would say. But yes, five years have passed since I last...spread my wings in this capacity. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">So, what brings you back? Is there some change of circumstance of which the court should be aware?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... I leave that to your imagination...My Lord. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So the 'Reaper' has been out of action for five years... Why did he have to choose today of all days to make a comeback?!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Don't lose heart! Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...As you wish, sir. The court nevertheless welcomes your return. Now then, opening statements, I think. A summary of the case, if you please. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Certainly, My Lord. As Your Lordship is aware, this is a case of overwhelming simplicity. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>We must be the only ones in here who aren't aware.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The incident took place in the late evening, three days past. The hour was some minutes after ten. The victim was a maker of building bricks known in the community as 'Thrice-Fired' Mason. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? 'Thrice...'?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">He was a very accomplished craftsman. The bricks he fired were said to be almost indestructible. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The victim's corpse was discovered in an omnibus in service on the streets of London at the time. A dagger that had been thrust into the victim's abdomen is believed to be the ultimate cause of death. Here is the autopsy report from the investigating medical officer at Scotland Yard. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Counsel. I shall accept that and the photograph as evidence. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And one further item of evidence... The prosecution wishes to submit these as well. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">And these are...? Good Lord! Is that blood, Counsel?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Yes, My Lord. Seized by a policeman who arrived at the scene... ...these gore-soaked gloves...were taken from the hands of the accused when he was arrested. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! <thought>Mr McGilded's gloves...had blood on them?!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, I will accept these as evidence as well. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>How did I get into this? I'm backed into a corner before I've even started...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is definitely...blood, isn't it? Not the most pleasant sight to be confronted with on our first day in London.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, nothing will come of grumbling now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No. ...By the way, is Mr McGilded right-handed?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, I believe so. He was toying with a coin in his right hand a little earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah...pity. If only he'd been left-handed.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think blood on either glove would be fairly incriminating, really.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Continuing... According to the driver of the omnibus... ...there were only two passengers travelling inside his vehicle at the time. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Only two?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Obviously, one of those passengers was the deceased brickmaker, Mr Mason. The other... ...was the accused, Magnus McGilded!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, well... Rather damning circumstances, to say the least. Defendant, what say you?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">......... Well of course, I have no recollection of such a ting. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr McGilded! </line>
<line speaker="McGilded">To be sure, I rode the omnibus that evenin'. But whenever I'm in a carriage, I'm taken with a fierce tiredness, and I always succumb to it. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are you claiming to have been asleep? </line>
<line speaker="McGilded">'Tis the motion of the carriage, My Lord. Liltin', so it is. And when I opened my eyes again... ...'twas a desperate sight before me. The body of a man I'd never laid eyes on before in me life. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm...</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So the blood got onto the gloves then, after the man had been killed...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Unfortunately... ...that statement of the driver's is only the beginning. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! <thought>That's not all of it?</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">There were multiple witnesses... ...to the precise moment at which the brickmaker was fatally stabbed! </line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">When the killing took place, the victim and the accused were inside the carriage. And there were witnesses to the crime. This is not just a case of compelling evidence... ...it's the nail in the coffin  for the accused. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... Thank you, Counsel. The circumstances of the crime have been made quite clear. I think we will hear testimony from these witnesses first of all. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Your wish is my command. Bailiff! Bring the witnesses in at once! </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Witnesses. Your names and occupations. </line>
<line speaker="Beppo">My name is... Well, everyone calls me Beppo. I, I drive an omnibus in the East End. </line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Bruce Fairplay. I'm a banker in the city. </line>
<line speaker="Furst">My name's Furst. Lay D. Furst. I, um...make hats for gents. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Let's begin by confirming the facts: Three days ago, at a short time after ten o'clock in the evening... ...all of you present in the stand were in an omnibus and witness to the aforementioned incident. Is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Quite right. </line>
<line speaker="Furst">Yes, sir, that's right, sir. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well then, let's proceed to your formal testimonies, please. Each of you will tell the court precisely what you saw!</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">It, it was the last bus of the evening, so I had few customers. I remember it well. </line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">The victim and the man accused of killing him were sat next to each other inside the bus.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">That's right. He stabbed him! I screamed, I did! Couldn't help it. </line>
<line speaker="Beppo">As soon as I heard the scream, I stopped my bus. And, and then I saw it, too!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... Unambiguous testimony, I must say. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Exactly, My Lord. These men witnessed the incident in the omnibus with their own eyes. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Um...I'd like to ask a question, if I may?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, this testimony... ...makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Why not?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...the incident took place inside a moving carriage, didn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As has been clearly stated from the outset, yes. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well in that case... ...how could those two witnesses possibly have seen what happened?! There's no way they could have seen the inside of the moving carriage!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">How...quaint. I'd read that civilisation in the Eastern island nations was a good century behind our own. But you're here in London yourself. Are you really so ignorant about our omnibuses? </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Tell me, my Nipponese friend... Have you even travelled in an omnibus?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Well...no... We, um...only arrived in London this morning. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">No matter. I've arranged for us all to see for ourselves. The actual scene of the crime, that is. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What...do you mean...? <thought>The actual scene? How?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">A carriage is designed to be moved, after all. ...Presumably you understand that much?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, yes... </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The omnibus in which this bloody crime took place is here today, in this very building. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Here...? WHAT?! The, the entire carriage?! </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Bailiff! Bring forth the stricken omnibus! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So that's an omnibus... THE omnibus... <thought>I can't believe they could bring something so enormous in here. Great Britain's courtrooms are amazing.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As you can see, the omnibus is pulled by two horses, and can carry up to eight passengers. Four passengers seated inside in the enclosed cabin, and another four on the rooftop deck above. Every Londoner knows... ...that the best views of the city's architecture and sights are to be had from the top of an omnibus. And I should point out to our foreign guests... ...that there is a skylight in the roof, allowing a view of the interior from the seats above. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, a skylight... ...Oh! </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The penny drops at last, I see. These two gentlemen were occupying the rooftop seats on this omnibus when the murder took place. That is how they came to witness the grim incident. Through the skylight. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh... That makes perfect sense...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Counsel, this is a first. In all my years behind the bench, I've never experienced the crime scene itself being brought into the courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">There are a number of important clues remaining inside the carriage, My Lord. I would like to submit the omnibus itself as evidence. ...That is the prosecution's wish. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, I see no reason why not. This omnibus is hereby formally accepted as evidence. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I can't believe it! The entire crime scene entered as evidence?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Well, let's open the door and go inside, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... The scene of a murder... It's horrible...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's blood that's soaked into the seat. The victim's obviously.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. And that seat would be clearly visible from the roof deck.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Would you really stab somebody in full view of the other passengers like that, I wonder...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, it was after dark. And there was a lamp on in here, so perhaps the culprit couldn't see anything outside through the skylight.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Whichever way you look at it, it doesn't seem like it was a planned attack.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, that's a poster for the Great Exhibition that's due to start six months from now. There's a lot of focus being drawn to the Crystal Tower, the centrepiece of the whole exposition.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ooh, the Crystal Tower... It's under construction already, I believe. People all over London must be fizzing with excitement at the prospect of such a grand event!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's quite a large skylight, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, quite large enough to afford a good view into the cabin from the roof deck.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And there doesn't appear to be a handle or catch of any description... So I suppose it can't be opened from inside the cabin at least.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This seat looks reasonably soft, but it's actually rather hard when you sit on it. And only just wide enough for two gentlemen to sit side by side, really.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Of course, an English gentlewoman would be dressed in such finery... ...it would be quite impossible for her to climb up to the roof deck, so she would have to be seated in here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A woman in a kimono would have the same problem. ...Women's clothes are very impractical, aren't they?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This seat has a handle, it seems...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This looks like all sorts of equipment that might be needed to keep the omnibus running.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Feeding tubs, tools to repair wheels, blankets, horse-shoeing tools... So it's a storage compartment for the coachman to keep his things, it seems.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There doesn't seem to be any space for passengers to stow their luggage, that's for sure.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well...I don't imagine it would be very convenient for that purpose anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Have you seen enough? Let's step back outside then.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So this is the roof deck of the omnibus. Oh, you must have a wonderful view of London's streets from up here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So people sit all the way up here on bitter winter nights with the cold air rushing past them? And they have to pay money to do so?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Brrr...I can't imagine how cold it must feel!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That...just made me think of something horrible. Can you imagine being dragged around the city in the freezing cold as a punishment?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Perhaps that is the real price you pay to stay out late.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You can certainly see inside the carriage through this opening, that's for sure.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, and there's a lamp in the enclosed cabin. So I'm sure the witnesses would have been able to see quite clearly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That's not good for me...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! Great Britain is simply extraordinary!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I could help myself a lot by giving that omnibus a thorough examination, seeing as it's here.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let us continue with proceedings, then. Your cross-examination, Counsel. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Hmph. Pray don't expect this Nipponese stray to understand the intricacies of a British court's cross-examination rites. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Alright... My first cross-examination in a British court... Focus, Ryunosuke... Focus!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Beppo">It, it was the last bus of the evening, so I had few customers. I remember it well. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...I think it was some time after ten, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Oh, yes, sir, that's, that's right, sir. Yes. Ever so cold, it was, sir. F-Freezing in fact.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And you had four passengers on board at the time. Is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Yes, yes, that's right, sir. Not all travelling in the same parts of the b-b-bus, of course, though. No.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And there were no other passengers when the incident took place? No one alighted, for example?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">You're quite right with that, sir. No other passengers like that, no. None.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So nobody fled the scene of the crime, then.</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Beppo">I have to say, the boss insists on it running, he does. Every evening. That last b-b-bus of the day. But I, I do wonder sometimes if it's altogether worthwhile. Yes, s-s-sorry to say...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Well, what with it being so cold and everything, and only m-making twenty pence on the run, you see... Yes, I, I spend that much at the p-p-pub on the way home just, just trying to warm up again.</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">I, I just can't believe it, sir. C-Can't believe it... A m-m-murder on my own b-bus. It's t-t-too awful to think about. I h-haven't been able to sh-shake this c-c-cold ever since it happened.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">The victim and the man accused of killing him were sat next to each other inside the bus.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And you saw them through the skylight in the roof of the carriage?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">That's right. When you sit up on the top deck, the window's right there at your feet. There was a lamp on inside, so I had a pretty good view. The two of them were wearing hats and I couldn't exactly make out their faces... ...but there's not a shred of doubt in my mind that it was Mr McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How can you be so sure?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Well...how can I put it politely? McGilded is a gentleman of...rather small stature. I couldn't have mistaken him for anyone else.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Let's not forget that when the vehicle came to a halt, the only people inside the enclosed cabin... ...were the deceased Mr Mason, and Mr McGilded. There is no room for doubt here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh, I really wish there was... [sic]</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Then out of the blue, the accused just reached over and plunged a knife right into his guts!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You actually saw the exact moment it happened?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Didn't I already testify to that? ...Or are fair dinkum, hard-working city bankers not considered trustworthy these days?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, no no! I, I didn't mean that! <thought>This is no good. I've really got his back up.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Perhaps you could just tell us what you saw in a little more detail, if that's-</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm? Juror number three? What's the meaning of this?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">My mind is made up, My Lord. Completely and utterly made up!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Made up about what...?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I don't like the stinking rich. Never have. They're always up to something or other that they shouldn't be. Every one of them. And that little leprechaun of a man is no exception. Well...he can't fool me! There's no point in wasting time listening to any more of this. That's my opinion on the matter, anyway.</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">That is precisely what I was about to say! As the foreman of the jury, it's my duty to set a good example to my fellow jurors.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What the...? <thought>What is happening here?!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let me see... Ah yes, it seems that's how the members of the jury give their verdicts.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...With fire?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Apparently, yes. White for innocent, and black for guilty. As the six members of the jury make up their minds about the case... ...one by one, they each cast a ball of fire into the great Scales of Justice...as we saw a moment ago.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So if those enormous scales fall completely to the black side, does that mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Let's do our very best to make sure that doesn't happen!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh... Now I'm even more worried than I was before...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. The court acknowledges the change in the jury's stance. Counsel for the Defence, please continue with your cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah... <thought>This is a nightmare...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Perhaps you could just tell us what you saw in a little more detail, if that's-</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">My Lord, if you'll forgive the interruption...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah, juror number two. Go on...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Mr McGilded is a pillar of society and a gentleman. And a gentleman's word should be sacrosanct. However... ...those of us in service know we must accept hard truths.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait, what are you about to do?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Dispose of the rubbish!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I don't wish to cause offence, but I do like to eradicate all traces of filth and grime.</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...I have painstakingly typed every word uttered here today, and cross-referenced all the facts. As such, I am now in a position to draw the only logical conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Not again...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's...four out of six jury members who've proposed a guilty verdict! There are only two left!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>We've had it... Every time I press these witnesses for more information, I just make the situation worse...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Nevertheless... ...what we need more than anything at the moment is more information. We're still very much in the dark.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose I'll just have to keep pressing the witnesses, knowing that more sparks may well fly...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We mustn't give up hope that we'll uncover something that will give us a way to fight back!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But... ......... Alright, I'll keep trying. <thought>I can't give up. I just need to keep calm and listen to the witnesses' statements again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Perhaps you could just tell us what you saw in a little more detail, if you don't mind?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Why don't you ask the young man next to me?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh! Me? Oh, well, yes...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Perhaps you could just tell us what you saw in a little more detail, if that's-</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>

<line speaker="Fairplay">Why don't you ask the young man next to me?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh! Me? Oh, well, yes...</line>
<line speaker="Furst">That's right. He stabbed him! I screamed, I did! Couldn't help it. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'He stabbed him,' you say. And you were sitting up on the roof deck, were you?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Yes, that's right, sir. I was up on the roof seats. I remember seeing the little gent sitting next to the fellow that was stabbed. I'd been thinking about a new hat design, you see. So I was just gazing absent-mindedly around. But then! ...Then I happened to look down through the skylight! It, it, it was sticking right out from his belly! That, that huge, great knife!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmph. A grim sight indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! <thought>That didn't help me at all! The jury look like they're even more convinced my client did it than they were before...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">That appears to have made everyone even more dubious that Mr McGilded is telling the truth. If only we had some evidence to counter their suspicions...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Mr Furst!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh! Yes, yes, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Is this the knife you saw?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh, good grief! Yes! That's it! The very one, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is, is that...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Yes, Counsel. This is the blade that was driven into the victim's belly like a stake through the heart.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That is a blade of considerable size, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It is. And furthermore, the scabbard is emblazoned prominently with a certain initial. The letter 'M'. ...Which seems oddly familiar.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... <thought>Please, no...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">'M' for 'Magnus' perhaps? Or 'McGilded' possibly? ...Take your pick. It seems this particular big name in London made a... magnificent mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But! But there are 'M's everywhere! Like...like... Yes! Like in 'Mason'!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, not conclusive, but certainly compelling, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm? Juror number three? What's the meaning of this?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">My mind is made up, My Lord. Completely and utterly made up!</line>

<line speaker="Susato">If this wasn't a court of law... ...I would have felt compelled to use a Susato Takedown for that lapse in judgement.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no! I'll, I'll be more careful!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As we have heard! The witness had an unfettered view of events unfolding. Would you not concur, coachman? Your diddering suggests that you would.</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Oh! Y-Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That part is the sheath, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm? Oh, sorry, yes. I...just don't really like blades.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh... Those don't seem like the words of a man with a large katana slung from his waist.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's not a blade; that's Kazuma's soul. Anyway...there's no sense in delaying it. Let's see what the blade looks like.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...that looks like a lot of blood.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It surely is blood. The victim's.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...an Englishman's blood looks a lot like a Japanese man's blood.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Did you think it wouldn't?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Sorry, it's just that we've only just arrived here in Great Britain. I'm finding it a little hard to adjust.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Yes, I do understand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An ornate letter 'M'... Undeniably Mr Magnus McGilded's initial.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And it's beautifully gilded, too. It must be very valuable, I should think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at this 'M'... If you turn it upside-down, it becomes a 'W'! This could change everything!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">A 'W'...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, this is one of those...you know, turnabout cases! I'm sure of it!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm afraid I don't know at all. But what I am sure of is that this is an 'M'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh. <thought>Well that idea was quickly quashed...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Beppo">As soon as I heard the scream, I stopped my bus. And, and then I saw it, too!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm...what exactly did you see?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Oh, well sir, that would be the p-p-passenger, sir. Yes, c-c-collapsed on the floor, he was.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And by the passenger, obviously you are referring to the victim, Mr Mason, the brickmaker.</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">And, and then the other p-p-passenger had that kn-knife in his hand, l-like this...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">By the other passenger, obviously you are referring to the accused, Mr Magnus McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">And then he p-p-p-plunged it down like this, s-stabbing the other passenger in the b-b-belly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>

<line speaker="Judge">...Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! It is hard to believe of one of London's greatest philanthropists, but this is damning indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The law knows no philanthropists, My Lord. Only the innocent...and the guilty. Good deeds mean nothing, when overshadowed by evil. The truth...is everything.</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Couldn't agree more, sir! The truth!</line>

<line speaker="Beppo">Couldn't agree more, sir! The truth!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Alright, so when it happened, the only two people in the enclosed cabin area were the victim and the defendant. And - so help me - THREE WHOLE PEOPLE witnessed the man I'm trying to defend do the deed...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I don't like to be pessimistic, but we do seem to be in a rather difficult situation here. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... <thought>What am I supposed to think here? Is Mr McGilded really innocent? Or could it be...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">B-before we jump to conclusions, our first task should be to gather information. We need to understand the case much better than we do at the moment. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! You're absolutely right. <thought>Let's listen to those witness statements again, a little more carefully this time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">My Lord, I wish to speak!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, juror number five? Do I take it that you, too...? </line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">As the master of the London Guild of Coachmen... ...the idea of a murder being committed in one of the city's carriages is utterly abhorrent to me. It wouldn't be right to make a decision before hearing all the facts, though, I said to myself. But I've heard enough now. The horse has bolted, as they say. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, no! Please, just keep an open mind a little long-</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Gee-up now, Silver Blaze! The finish is in sight! Beppo is a long-standing member of the guild, and I trust what the man says. </line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Oh, thank you, sir. You're t-t-too kind, sir. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh, this is t-t-too unkind, sir...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Which now means that five jurors agree to condemn this man. Madam juror number six...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Yes, dear? What can I do for you? </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You have heard the testimonies of the witnesses in the stand. </line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Oh yes. I certainly have. Still got my hearing, you know! </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Then, pray tell, why are you yet to pronounce your leaning? </line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">......... Well, dear, the thing is, I'm a creature of habit, me. I always go to the park at around this time of day, and sit on a nice bench and get on with my knitting. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">There's a lovely little park just near where I live. McGilded Park, it's called. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">The gentleman donated it to the city, you know. To put a smile on Londoners' faces, he said. I can't imagine such a fine, young gentleman would have it in him to take another man's life. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">How many Londoners live with their heads in the clouds?! Do you people not know... ...what kind of a man Magnus McGilded really is? </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What kind of a man is he?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The philanthropist, Magnus McGilded... ...has enough wealth to purchase the entire city he claims to value so highly. But where did all that wealth come from? Your client is a shylock, sir! And one with the very darkest of souls. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! </line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Stone the crows! </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">McGilded lends money at extortionate rates of interest so his victims have no hope of repaying him. When they default, he takes possession of everything they own. He is a vulture that preys on the weak. </line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I've, I've never heard any mention of that before...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Your faculties haven't deserted you, I'm sure, madam. So has this thought not crossed your mind? Would a man wealthy enough to buy London in its entirety not have a carriage of his own?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What possible reason could this man have had to make use of a public omnibus service? </line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Um...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're not saying that...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The victim - a poor brickmaker - had next to nothing to his name, save considerable financial liability. It will come as no surprise that his creditor was the accused, Magnus McGilded. But let it also be known, that the very day Mr Mason was killed, was the final repayment date for his debts. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The brickmaker was destitute. He had lost his house. He had not a shilling with which to repay his debts. And in the end, this pitiful soul had the very last thing he owned taken from him...his life. By the merciless philanthropist pretender... Magnus McGilded!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I don't believe it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Susato">If I might add something briefly...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato? </line>
<line speaker="Susato">You claim that the victim had been lent money by Mr McGilded... ...but where is the evidence to support your claim?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of filling my hallowed chalice in a court of law...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah-ha, there it is! Lord van Zieks's hallowed chalice! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>How can this be considered acceptable?!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...But I find myself in unexpectedly good humour. I had heard ladies from the Far East could show great courage...but I didn't expect to experience it myself. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah! As, as judicial assistant to the defence, I am simply doing my job! </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What a pity that your display of courage...is in vain. This is the debtors' ledger, which details all monies loaned by the accused. You will find the victim's name clearly recorded inside. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Allow me to present this ledger as evidence... ...and pray forgive the discourtesy of raising my chalice in a toast to the enigmatic East at the same time! </line>
<line speaker="Judge">A marvellous toast, Counsel! I will gladly accept this new evidence. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah yes, twenty guineas... The victim owed a considerable sum. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...This portfolio must contain all sorts of secrets of London's gentry.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear... Do you really think we ought to look inside?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, it's not as though we know any of London's gentry personally, is it? Apart from our great detective friend, perhaps. ......... <thought>Actually, I wonder...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I assure you we will not find Mr Sholmes's name inside!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, let's see what we find...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Gosh, it's crammed full of gentlemen's names, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, I suppose they're probably not all gentlemen at all, are they? <thought>After all, not everyone in this country is well off...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah! Goodness!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Look at this! Do you see the name here?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Bruce Fairplay'... ...Should that mean something to me? It, it does sound strangely familiar, actually...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Bruce Fairplay! The witness testifying at this very moment!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes, of course! The banker! Why is his name in here? <thought>...Ah, he borrowed twenty guineas, did he?</thought> And look, the repayment date is fast approaching.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's possible that this is just a coincidence, of course. But this could be very useful information.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Gosh, it's crammed full of gentlemen's names, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, I suppose they're probably not all gentlemen at all, are they? <thought>After all, not everyone in this country is well off...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And the accused made quite certain he had ample recompense. </line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">......... Well, it would seem I've... ...I've had the wool pulled over my eyes. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Regrettably, madam, that is the modus operandi of the accused. </line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">And it's such a pretty little park, too. ...What a scoundrel! .........Still... ...maybe it's all for the best. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! W-Wait a minute! Let's think about this a little more before-</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I don't stand for nonsense! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>That was it... The last juror's decision...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... ...Ah, according to this Encyclopaedia of British Law... 'When all members of the jury have concluded that the defendant is guilty... ...court proceedings are suspended, and the presiding judge will deliver the final verdict and sentence.' That's what it says here. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Haah... The final verdict... It's over then.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! There's a footnote, though. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A footnote?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">'However, the defence-'</line>
<line speaker="Judge">All six members of the jury are now in agreement in this case. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Allow me to convey my respect for your swift and righteous decision. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">According to the laws of this country, I will now conclude the trial... ...by delivering my final verdict. ...I trust there are no objections?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... ......... Miss Susato, just tell me one thing...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You were in the middle of saying something before. The footnote in your Encyclopaedia of British Law. 'However, the defence...' What did it say next?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">O-Oh yes, of course. One moment... 'When all members of the jury have concluded that the defendant is guilty... ...court proceedings are suspended, and the presiding judge will deliver the final verdict and sentence.' Then the footnote says... 'However, the defence... ...has the right to demand a summation examination of the jurors at this point.' </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A...summation...examination...? </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah! </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Judging from the binding, I would say that book is at least fifty years old. Any modern text on British Law wouldn't even give such an antiquated procedure a mention. It's a relic. Long forgotten, and certainly no longer practised. So you're out of luck. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What even is it, Miss Susato? This so-called 'summation examination'?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, um... One moment, and I'll read about it. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...You would demand the right to a procedure before you even understand what it entails? Hmph, typical Nipponese. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Alright, Mr Naruhodo, I think I understand... It seems that under this procedure, we would be able to appeal to the members of the jury. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">To do what...exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Appeal to them to change their leaning and reverse their decisions. And it says here that... ...'If successful, the proceedings of the trial must be resumed.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Make them reverse their decisions...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, in times gone by, barristers would use a summation examination to attempt to influence the jury's decision. But that procedure became something of a formality with no practical benefit, really. So it rather fell out of use. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wonder why... </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Because it was devoid of purpose. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Changing just one member of the jury's mind would be hard enough, let alone several. No self-respecting defence barrister would even assert his right to try in this day and age. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Still... ...I don't see any mention of the procedure actually being formally revoked. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What are you suggesting?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm suggesting that although it may be antiquated and largely forgotten...it isn't yet extinct. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>A summation examination... Our last possible option. Do we assert our right to carry it out, or admit defeat?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo... Are you sure that's the right decision?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You heard what the judge and the prosecutor said. It's an antiquated procedure. It's history. We barely know our way around the law that's in use today. What hope would we have of pulling it off?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........  Perhaps what we don't know can work to our advantage.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">In any case, there's really only one course of action available to us here. What we can't afford to do is allow this trial to end!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! <thought>What we don't know can work to our advantage...?</thought> You're right, Miss Susato. Let's bring this antiquated procedure back into the present day!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But if it's our right, it's our right! I believe it could prove vital in this trial!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The defence's petition is perfectly valid. The court will proceed with the summation examination!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">This is madness...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Foreman, are you and the remainder of the jury ready?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Eh?! Well, erm, I'm not, erm... There was no mention of this in the letter I received, you see, so...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">All members of the jury will be asked to explain on what grounds they have reached their decision.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">On what grounds...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You must all justify your decisions and explain why you believed the defendant to be guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Well, My Lord, you're rather putting us on the spot...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">This is most irregular. No mention was made of this before.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I don't really hold with all this 'justifying' lark.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That seems to have thrown the jurors off...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">It seems none of them have experienced this before.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Alright then, the summation examination... A defence procedure no practising lawyer has attempted for years, is it? Well, just maybe... ...it might be the opportunity we've been looking for... to turn this trial around!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">So be it, then. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court hereby calls upon you... ...to state the grounds on which you find the defendant, Magnus McGilded, guilty of this most serious crime.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">There was no one else inside the carriage at the time, so it has to have been him.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I trust the driver. He has an excellent memory, it seems. Four passengers, with fares totalling twenty pence.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">He stuck the chap next to him just like this! Brazen, I must say. Absolutely brazen!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I have simply typed and collated all the statements made thus far, and drawn the logical conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">You can trust the guild. Fair fares is our motto. We haven't raised prices above fourpence for years.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">The scoundrel, stabbing that poor man on the floor! It beggars belief!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I'm starting to wish I hadn't pushed for this now...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Some of the jurors don't seem to have wonderfully formed arguments, though, do they?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, let's see what we can do. We need to get these six people to change their minds. <thought>I'll have to throw everything I can at them! And use some very persuasive language...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Just a moment, Mr Naruhodo. According to my book, that's not quite how it works.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh? I thought I was going to have to thaw their icy minds with some heart-warming rhetoric about the defendant.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Unfortunately... ...once the jurors have decided the defendant is guilty, they're unlikely to heed anything the defence says.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but then...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">They've reached their conclusions by their own reasoning, you see. Your pleas will sound like excuses. In fact, it could recoil on you. The more you try to persuade them, the more entrenched they may become.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then what on earth am I supposed to do?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear. I'm just citing what I've read about British law, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right, I'm sorry. ...Do you have any idea how to make this work, then?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, from what I can understand... ...the key to this procedure is using the jurors' own words to make your arguments.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, the six members of the jury are randomly selected members of the public. They may appear to present a united front, but the truth is... ...they are complete strangers, who just happen to find themselves here in the courtroom together.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And...that's the way to break them down, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, exactly. We must listen very carefully to what each member of the jury says... ...and see if we can identify any contradictory statements. If we can, we then contrast the statements and pit the corresponding jurors against each other!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see. So it's contradictions in what two or more jurors say that we're looking for. In a way, then... ...this is similar to a regular cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Yes, I, I suppose you're right!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>Find contradictions in their statements and pit the jurors against one another to break them down... Alright, I might be able to pull this off. ...No, that's not right... I HAVE TO pull this off!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Can we start proceedings, Counsel? I would ask you to take the stand for this. I'm expecting a clear and concise rebuttal!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">There was no one else inside the carriage at the time, so it has to have been him.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Certainly, the testimonies we've heard suggest the victim and Mr McGilded were alone inside the carriage.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Precisely my point.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But! Could there be some other explanation? Something we haven't considered yet?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Such as...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Haha, well, um...perhaps that's something we could, um... all work out together now?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Now listen here! Maybe you don't know how things work around here because you're...from foreign climes. But we're here to form our opinions as individuals. And I have!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear. He doesn't appear to be in the mood to consider an alternative point of view, does he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>No, I'm going to have to pit the jurors against one another, like Susato-san said. Finding contradictions in these six people's assertions is the only way I'm going to succeed...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I trust the driver. He has an excellent memory, it seems. Four passengers, with fares totalling twenty pence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But does his ability to recall his takings that night really tell us how trustworthy the man is?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I manage all His Lordship's cash affairs, so I'm very particular when it comes to accounts.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">A single penny can mean the difference between life and death, after all, can't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That's, that's a saying in your country?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">My point is, a man who minds his figures is a man you can trust. Those of us in service would swear to that, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Does that bench really need any more polishing...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">So if the good driver says that he saw Mr McGilded in the act, I don't doubt him. The only task left to do today is disposing of the rubbish.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ah, now wait a minute... One of the other jurors mentioned something about money, I think.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Now would be a very good time to listen carefully to the jurors' statements again, Mr Naruhodo. If you notice an inconsistency in what two different jurors are saying...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I should expose it by pitting them against each other. <thought>Yes, let's see if I can do just that...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly contradict each other!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">They do? Explain yourself, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Me?! Oh dear, what have I said?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">According to the group testimony we've heard so far... ...there were four passengers on the omnibus on the night in question. And according to the coachman, Mr Beppo, he took twenty pence in fares.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Quite right. I have those precise details typed neatly here in front of me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And juror number five also told us the following: The fare for the omnibus...is always fourpence.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">That it is. A fair and convenient single price. Just the way London's carriages should be operated!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But that doesn't add up at all. In fact, it leaves a glaring discrepancy in the facts.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Why, man, why?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Four passengers paying fourpence each. If you do the multiplication...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Ah! It would be sixteen pence!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly. As I said, it doesn't add up. The figures are different. By fourpence, in fact. ...Or precisely one person's fare.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">One person's fare?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! In other words, on the omnibus that night... ...it's distinctly possible...there was another passenger we've heard nothing about!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">This, this can't be right! The coachmen of the guild are good, honest men, one and all! Trustworthiness is our watchword!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">The figures your coachman claims most certainly do not add up. Your watchword, good sir, is a fallacy!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I beg your pardon?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Guildmaster, I think you ought to consider that if this trial were to end now... ...the news will surely spread all over London. The news that one of your coachmen tried to hide the fact that he lets nefarious characters ride his omnibus.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">...! Alright then, how do I make it so this miserable trial doesn't end, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, according to my book here... ...you simply launch a ball of fire onto the innocent side of the set of scales!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Now hold your horses there, coachman! We were all in agreement! Why do you have to go and-</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Wait till I get my hands on you, Beppo!!!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Argh! This is all very irritating...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Begging your pardon, sir, I'm going to do the same.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">For the love of Mike! Not you as well?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">A penny can be the difference between a smile and a tear, after all. I certainly can't put my trust in someone who doesn't follow my exacting standards in financial matters.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Oh really?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I, for one, think it's only proper that we hear from the witnesses again.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Two more... <thought>Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Then that's where you must strike next!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Exactly! You can do it!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly contradict each other!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">They do? Explain yourself, Counsel!</line>

<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I'm changing my leaning to innocent. I should like to hear what the slipshod bookkeeper has to say for himself!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">He stuck the chap next to him just like this! Brazen, I must say. Absolutely brazen!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Careful! You, you could hurt somebody with that!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Tsk! You're a fine one to talk! What of that sword hanging from your waist, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no! That's...just my battered soul...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Well anyway, I despise anyone with too much money. They're all the same. All stabbing some brickmaker or other behind the scenes, you mark my words!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That...seems very unlikely, doesn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Are you mad, man? We know that small shorty is a rotten shylock!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, yes, that does seem to be the case, but-</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! Please! Be careful what you say!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">If he's been trying to squeeze money out of us less fortunate, then as far as I'm concerned... ...he's as guilty as sin! The man can hang!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Come to think of it... ...didn't one of the other jurors have something to say about the defendant's underhand activities?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">If you've thought of something, Mr Naruhodo, don't let it go! Test your theory!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Pit the two jurors whose statements seem to be contradictory against each other...? No time like the present to use [X / Y / R] to 'Pit' them against each other...or I'll never get anywhere...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements are completely contradictory!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Whaaat?! Explain, Counsel, post-haste!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Oh dearie me! I, I was only knitting a jumper for my other half!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">What is all this claptrap? What does 'contradictory' even mean, I ask you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We've heard from more than one witness... ...that they allegedly saw the actual moment when the defendant stabbed the victim. Now, out of curiosity, juror number three...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">What?! Can't you see that I'm busy here?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim? What sort of motion was it?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Ha! Want to test me, do you? It was like this! Stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up! Just like the prim banker said.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, that was Mr Fairplay's testimony. Quite true.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Now then, juror number six...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...Oh! Is that me, is it? What can I do for you, young man?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim, madam?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Oh, well dear, as far as I understand it... ...it was like this! He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor! ...The coachman said so.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Now don't move! Take a look at these two jurors! 'He stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up!' And 'He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor!'</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well I never! They're... They're stabbing in totally different directions!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Bless my stitches! What a muddle!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What this tells us... ...is that there's a strong possibility one of the witnesses isn't telling the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">But why?! Why the dickens would they lie?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I don't know that yet. But what I do know... ...is that if the trial ends at this point, we may never find out! We may never know the real truth! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury! Can you really let that happen, in all good conscience?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Lies, you say? Oh dearie me... I can't abide people telling lies!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">The, the scales...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I don't believe it!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Waaaaaait! Now hear this, my fellow jurors: I warn you, you cannot listen to this man! Look at him, in his black suit! He's...he's...clearly some devious Eastern sorcerer using magic on us all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>If I could use magic, do you really think I'd be putting myself through all this?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Answer me this, Dark Jinx!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh?! M-Me?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">What exactly is the problem? What of it if two witnesses have slightly different recollections of events?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What of it?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Let's say the shylock did stab the victim as he was sat next to him on the omnibus. And this young dandy saw him do it! And now let's say the victim collapsed on the floor, and then the shylock stabbed him again! And this old lady saw him do it! Well? What's to say it didn't happen like that, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Who are you calling a dandy, sir?! Why, I should take this knife to you!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Who are you calling old?! Why, I should take this needle to you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh...they're ready to kill each other now... But could the foreman of the jury be right? Did the two witnesses see two different moments of the same crime?</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm, it's true... There's an outside chance of almost anything you care to mention.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Eeexactly the point I've been trying to make!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Before you go any further, Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! What is it, Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I think you should have a look through the Court Record.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You see? This evidence makes it quite clear. There isn't even an outside chance of what the juror is saying!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>How did I miss that...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Hm? What is it, you dark jinx? Come on, out with it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...What you're suggesting is impossible! It's out of the question!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">What, what are you talking about, man? How can you possibly say that? You, you do realise that I'm...I'm only doing my job! As foreman of the jury, I have a responsibility to steer everyone in the right direction. So where's your evidence, man? That's what we want to see! I say the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime. If you say that's out of the question, show me some proof!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>It looks like the only way I'm going to convince him is to present him with something he can't dismiss. Some irrefutable hard evidence!</thought> As you wish.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'll give you the proof. It's out of the question that the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime...as proven by... </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Eh?! Only once?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's quite simple! The victim was stabbed precisely one time. Which means these witnesses can't possibly have seen it happen two different times!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Huuurgh...grrr...hyuuurgh... Alright...I concede defeat!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Two more... <thought>Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Then that's where you must strike next!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Exactly! You can do it!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Eh?! Only once?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's quite simple! The victim was stabbed precisely one time. Which means these witnesses can't possibly have seen it happen two different times!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Huuurgh...grrr...hyuuurgh... Alright...I concede defeat!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">......... Do you know what they say about me, young man? They say I've got no powers of persuasion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, I see... Erm... I'm sorry to hear that...?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">But no one will need persuading about this: You're even worse than me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Aaagh! <thought>Two different moments... In other words, the victim was stabbed two times... Ah! But we have evidence that clearly contradicts that possibility!</thought> If you'll allow me another chance...I'd like to present you with one more piece of evidence to consider.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I'm no lover of the rich, but I despise liars even more! Innocent is my call, for now at least!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I have simply typed and collated all the statements made thus far, and drawn the logical conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What have you been doing all this time?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">'What have you been doing all this time?'... There. ...I should have thought it was obvious. I am recording everything that takes place as part of these proceedings.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And...what have you learnt from that?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">For example, at this moment in time, the judge has used his gavel eleven times in total... ...the prosecution has snorted derisively at your remarks seven times in total... ...and, I might add, each time you have gawped like a simpleton.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Thank you. <thought>And what's the point exactly?</thought> So anyway, madam, are you able to explain why you think the defendant is guilty?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">......... That is a conclusion I have drawn as a result of the copious notes I have typed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Clearly! But I'm asking you to explain WHY you've drawn that conclusion!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Please don't distract me. It makes it extremely hard to concentrate on my note-keeping.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This is going nowhere...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">You can trust the guild. Fair fares is our motto. We haven't raised prices above fourpence for years.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's how much it costs to take the omnibus?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">That's right. As the guildmaster, I decided to set a policy for all drivers across the city. One fare, no matter which bus you take or how far you're going. We have to compete with the rise of the motor car, you see. Us coachmen have to make a stand together!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Motor cars, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Yes. And this murder on one of our buses is extremely damaging to our cause! It's beyond the pale! It'll lead to a decline in passengers, you mark my words! And it's all that rascal's fault! He has to pay!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Is it the crime or his buses he's more worried about...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Anyway, every member of my guild is reliable and trustworthy. So if the driver says he saw him do it, that fellow in the dock is as guilty as sin!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly contradict each other!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">They do? Explain yourself, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Me?! Oh dear, what have I said?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">According to the group testimony we've heard so far... ...there were four passengers on the omnibus on the night in question. And according to the coachman, Mr Beppo, he took twenty pence in fares.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Quite right. I have those precise details typed neatly here in front of me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And juror number five also told us the following: The fare for the omnibus...is always fourpence.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">That it is. A fair and convenient single price. Just the way London's carriages should be operated!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But that doesn't add up at all. In fact, it leaves a glaring discrepancy in the facts.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Why, man, why?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Four passengers paying fourpence each. If you do the multiplication...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Ah! It would be sixteen pence!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly. As I said, it doesn't add up. The figures are different. By fourpence, in fact. ...Or precisely one person's fare.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">One person's fare?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! In other words, on the omnibus that night... ...it's distinctly possible...there was another passenger we've heard nothing about!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">This, this can't be right! The coachmen of the guild are good, honest men, one and all! Trustworthiness is our watchword!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">The figures your coachman claims most certainly do not add up. Your watchword, good sir, is a fallacy!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I beg your pardon?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Guildmaster, I think you ought to consider that if this trial were to end now... ...the news will surely spread all over London. The news that one of your coachmen tried to hide the fact that he lets nefarious characters ride his omnibus.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">...! Alright then, how do I make it so this miserable trial doesn't end, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, according to my book here... ...you simply launch a ball of fire onto the innocent side of the set of scales!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Now hold your horses there, coachman! We were all in agreement! Why do you have to go and-</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Wait till I get my hands on you, Beppo!!!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Argh! This is all very irritating...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Begging your pardon, sir, I'm going to do the same.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">For the love of Mike! Not you as well?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">A penny can be the difference between a smile and a tear, after all. I certainly can't put my trust in someone who doesn't follow my exacting standards in financial matters.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Oh really?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I, for one, think it's only proper that we hear from the witnesses again.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Two more... <thought>Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.</thought></line>

<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Grrr! Beppo! This trial has to continue so I can get to the bottom of this corruption! Not guilty, I say!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">The scoundrel, stabbing that poor man on the floor! It beggars belief!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I really think you should stop waving that needle around...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">You heard what the good coachmen said before, didn't you? That hideous man stabbed the poor fellow! Just like this!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Y-Yes... That is what he said, you're right.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">......... McGilded Park is such a lovely little place, too. I've always enjoyed resting my legs there while I get on with my knitting. And I had thought that anyone who donated such a delightful place must be a fine fellow indeed. I suppose I was wrong. ......... Whoever would have thought he was a miserable, murdering moneylender with not a scrap of remorse?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Oh help... She's as sure as sure can be that he's guilty now...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">The old lady certainly seems to know her mind, doesn't she?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements are completely contradictory!</line>

<line speaker="Susato">'Hm... So...we just need to find two jurors with contradictory statements and pit them against each other. ...Which is so much easier said than done!' Is that perhaps what were just thinking?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How did you know?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, I took the liberty of doing some research, in case you happened to find yourself in just such a situation. Shall I read you what I found out? It is a little long, I'm afraid... </line>
<line speaker="Susato">'...If I have to rely on advice right from the start, how will I get on later? No, I need to work this out for myself now!' ...Is that perhaps what you were just thinking?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How did you know?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, that sort of attitude...is most admirable, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I know what I have to do. Let's listen to those assertions one more time...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Very well. Listen to this... During the summation examination, you will hear the assertions of the six members of the jury. In this situation, the counsel for the defence should use [X / Y / R] and 'Pit' with impunity! Having done so, you will be able to compare the chosen assertion with those of the other jurors. Select the corresponding buttons to listen to the other jurors' assertions again. Note that you cannot choose the assertion of the juror you initially selected... ...nor can you choose assertions of jurors who have changed their leaning to 'not guilty' already. Once you've compared the various jurors' assertions... ...work out which two contradict each other, and then 'Pit' them together with [X / Y / R] to pull them apart!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see... <thought>She wasn't joking when she said it was long.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">The first step is to listen very carefully to what each individual juror has to say. Then I'm sure you'll start to see which ones might not quite agree with each other.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright then... <thought>Let's get this right now, so I never have to listen to that long and boring explanation again!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's the spirit!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What do you think, Mr Naruhodo? I took the liberty of doing some research to help us navigate a situation such as this... </line>
<line speaker="Susato">'...If I have to rely on advice right from the start, how will I get on later? No, I need to work this out for myself now!' ...Is that perhaps what you were just thinking?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How did you know?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, that sort of attitude...is most admirable, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I know what I have to do. Let's listen to those assertions one more time...</thought></line>

<line speaker="Susato">That's the spirit!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Wait! That, that means... ...four jurors are now leaning to not guilty!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">We've done it, Mr Naruhodo! We've won!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">What are you playing at, you dandy fool?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Shut your trap, sir! No one deceives me!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">But we had a consensus!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I said shut your trap! I know a liar when I see one! And if the chap ever dares to cross the threshold of my shop... ...I'll take this razor-sharp blade...and shave every last hair off his head!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Please tell me he's a barber...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well! In a quite remarkable turn of events... ...the defence's summation examination has flipped the balance of the Scales of Justice! The jurors now stand at two for guilty...and four for not guilty! Accordingly, there is no longer a large enough majority among the jury for me to adjudicate... ...and the trial must continue! I hereby ask the defence, prosecution and witnesses to return to their places. And I call upon all of you to continue to pursue the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So...Lord Van Zieks. Continue to substantiate the case for the prosecution, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Having savoured the rich aroma of the carmine contents of this hallowed chalice... ...it may seem crass to crush it to dust. ...Pray forgive the discourtesy.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">L-Lord van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Brrr... Is it cold in here, or is it just me?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As your antiquated tome no doubt says, the prosecution may not speak during a summation examination. So I honoured a deathly silence...and listened to the charade. It seems I overestimated the intelligence of the jury.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Well, no matter. There is nothing so hard to prove as a self-evident truth, it would seem. No... And why else would we grace the courtroom with our presence after all? So, let us proceed to the next round of battle. Bring forth the witnesses once more!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Witnesses! I trust you heard the summation examination we have just had to...endure?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Oh, y-yes, sir, that I did, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Of course I heard it!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh yes, sir. I heard it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You, sir, on the end... The coachman. I believe it's 'Beppo'?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Y-Yes, sir, My Lord, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If it transpires that in your previous testimony... ...you were attempting to veil the presence of a fifth passenger on your omnibus... ...you will be found guilty of perjury! You are advised to bear that in mind, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Uhhh... Oh mio Dio... Uhhh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, witnesses. I hereby call on you to testify before the court again. You will explain the various misgivings brought to our attention by the defence's summation examination!</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">I, I only c-carried f-four passengers that night! I swear it! ...B-B-But, um...</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Well, I for one was told I had to pay fivepence for the bus.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">He fiddled us on the fare, he did! And then I saw that blood-curdling sight as well... It's all too much!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">I tell you, I saw McGilded stabbing that man! Everything I said before stands!</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Oh yes... Yes, he s-s-stabbed him. Yes he did. ...I, I think so, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, make sense of this for me, please.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The phantom fifth passenger conjured into existence by my learned Eastern friend never existed. The confusion has arisen from the coachman's sly little... cozenage.</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Uhhh...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Beppo! Explain yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">I'm t-terribly sorry, G-G-Guildmaster!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">The guild's fare is fourpence across the board! You know that! Am I to understand that you've been overcharging our passengers by a penny a fare?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">It's, it's so c-c-cold... And the last r-run of the day is always h-h-half empty...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... You have been dishonest, coachman.</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Uhhh... I'm s-sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">You're a disgrace, Beppo! A disgrace! And your selfish actions have brought dishonour on the entire guild!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">If I may, sir...? I had to pay tenpence on the bus just last week.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">WHAAAAAAT?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Four passengers at fivepence each is... Yes, twenty pence. I've done the arithmetic ten times already, but I just can't make the result come out differently!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...No, that...figures.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, it would appear that one of the aforementioned misgivings has already been explained. So, Counsel for the Defense... Your cross-examination, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">We've already had the pleasure of a protracted summation examination today. I see you intend to continue the parlour games.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... ...Absolutely!</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">I, I only c-carried f-four passengers that night! I swear it! ...B-B-But, um... </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, there were only four passengers on your carriage, but you didn't charge them the standard fourpence fare. Is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">......... It's, it's imp-p-possible to make the last run of the day p-p-pay! I was so c-c-cold, it was all I could d-do to stop myself p-p-passing out!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I'm getting chilblains just listening to you.</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">It was t-t-terrible! So I wanted to give myself a p-p-pat on the back for even keeping the b-bus running! Doesn't a d-dedicated coachman d-deserve an extra p-p-penny per p-p-p-p-passenger?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You're digging a deeper hole for yourself here... <thought>If only there had been a fifth passenger on the omnibus that night... Then we would have had another suspect.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Well, I for one was told I had to pay fivepence for the bus.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Does that mean everyone on board that night paid fivepence instead of four?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Well, I paid fivepence, too, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">And I just told you that I did.</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">A flat f-fare of fivepence across the b-b-board!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>It's not something to be proud of...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The so-called discrepancy my learned friend identified was nothing of the sort. Much like the phantom killer you so desperately needed, it's gone. Dead...and buried...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I'd have been happy if it had ever existed in the first place...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Furst">He fiddled us on the fare, he did! And then I saw that blood-curdling sight as well... It's all too much!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This 'blood-curdling' sight... You mean the murder, I presume?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A loathsome sight. No one should have to witness the horror in the eyes of a man the moment his life is taken.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh, well...not exactly, sir. I mean, I didn't actually see the exact moment the gent was stabbed.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious! Really?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">We have another witness who did, however. The banker has already testified to it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm, but Mr Furst didn't actually see the point at which the victim was killed. That may turn out to be very significant...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Furst">I heard the banker gent next to me take a sharp intake of breath, see. That's when I looked through the glass. That's, that's when I saw that horrible blade poking out from his belly, all covered in blood! Every time I see a knife now, I can't help screaming. Even when I'm eating...</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">I tell you, I saw McGilded stabbing that man! Everything I said before stands!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you saw the defendant, Mr McGilded, stabbing the victim, Mr Mason, who was sitting next to him?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">...That's, that's what I said, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>It was bothering me before, this was. For just a brief moment, he hesitated before answering the question.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Anyway, there was only the two of them inside the carriage, wasn't there?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...There's been much talk of a fifth passenger. But as yet...zero evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Then what are we wasting all this time for, eh? It's black and white! The man's guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>Something about Mr Fairplay's testimony just...jars with me... I wish I could work out what it was...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Oh yes... Yes, he s-s-stabbed him. Yes he did. ...I, I think so, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Earlier, you testified that you saw the moment when the defendant allegedly stabbed the victim, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Oh, yes. Yes, that's right.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You said that the victim was on the floor, and described the assailant holding the knife in an ice pick grip.</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">......... I, I suppose... ...I m-might have...you know. Yes... P-P-Put the c-cart before the horse, maybe...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What's this?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Well, I'm q-quite sure about m-most of it... I was d-driving the horses when I heard a scream f-f-from the seats on the roof deck.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh! I expect that was me, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Then when I t-t-turned around...yes. Yes, I s-saw it through the skylight. The g-gentleman was on the floor, and the knife was s-sticking up out of his m-m-midriff. That's right, yes. And the f-f-fellow holding the h-handle was the f-famous man. Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, in short... ...you didn't see the moment when the victim was actually stabbed at all?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">......... ...I, I r-really thought that I did, b-b-but... ...but when I g-go over it again in my head... ...no. I, I suppose I d-didn't actually see the p-precise moment of the s-stabbing, did I?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to say about that, Mr Fairplay?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Now you listen to me! I know what you're thinking! 'He didn't really see the exact moment the fellow was stabbed! What are the chances of that?' ...Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Are you asking me or telling me? <thought>He's getting flustered. I might be able to extract some new information from him if I answer him cleverly... Could he have just happened to see the exact moment the crime was committed?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, it is a little hard to believe, certainly. Unless you spend your time peeping through a skylight on the top of an omnibus, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, I suppose some days are like that. Sooner or later you'll see something you wish you hadn't... ...if you're always peeping through a skylight on the top of an omnibus.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Peeping?! I'm a, a respectable city banker, I'll have you know! And I know what I saw! I remember it as clear as a Ballarat day! It was a grim scene, I don't mind telling you...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Mr Fairplay.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Oh! Excuse me if I was getting a little hot under the collar there, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I would ask you to supplement your testimony with a clear statement about what exactly you saw.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Oh, I can do that alright. I'll tell you just how grim it was!</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">In, in fact, now that I c-c-come to think of it... ...it, it m-m-must've already happened when I heard the scream...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Of course!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">That goes without saying!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>But I really wish he had said it earlier...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The autopsy report makes it quite clear that the victim was stabbed only once. Which means... ...the banker was witness to the fatal wound that ended Mr Mason's life.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm...</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">D'you think I'd forget the sight of those blood-soaked hands after that butcher stabbed the man?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Blood-soaked?!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Ahem! Well, perhaps 'soaked' is laying it on a little thick, but... But anyway! There was definitely blood all over them. Both of them were covered in it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And you saw that from the roof? Through the skylight?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Well, the skylight's reasonably large, so I had a pretty good view. And there was a lamp on inside the carriage as well. So I'm quite sure of what I saw!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm...this banker's latest statement... I feel sure there's something not quite right about it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">When you feel something doesn't add up, Mr Naruhodo... ...that's when you should have a good look through the Court Record!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Not long ago, this trial very nearly came to an end. Somehow, we've managed to keep our chances alive here. I can't waste this cross-examination! I have to use it to bring some new facts to light!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Hm, if you're not careful when you press these witnesses... ...the danger is that the jury will end up believing something...unhelpful, as they did before.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Maybe. ...But we can't let the fear of that happening stop us from uncovering important new information.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...! Yes, you're so right.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I need to pay careful attention here. I don't want to miss even a flicker of a reaction among these witnesses!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Remember, if you happen to spot one of the witnesses reacting in a strange way... ...don't hesitate to pursue them as to the reason!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Blood-soaked...hands?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Well, I admit that 'soaked' might be laying it on a little thick, but... But anyway! There was definitely blood all over them. Both of them were covered in it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, I'm very sorry to disagree, Mr Fairplay, but that's more than a little peculiar.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Here are the gloves worn by the defendant, Mr McGilded, on the night in question.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Oh...yes...right...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And there certainly does appear to be a sizeable dark-coloured stain there. But, as I'm sure you can clearly see... ...it's only on the right-hand glove.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Arrrrgh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In short, Mr Fairplay... ...your testimony is inconsistent!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Gyaaagh! But, but...no! That can't be right!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">So you're the liar here then!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Gargh!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">That's right! You were quite clear about it. You said - Hyuurgh! - it was both hands!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Grrr...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Fairplay. If your last statement was a lie... ...it calls your entire testimony into question. You say you saw the moment the victim was stabbed. ...But is that really the truth?!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Argh! I...well... I...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! Mr Fairplay categorically stated that he saw blood 'all over both hands'! Which means there's a strong possibility that this witness was deliberately trying to mislead the court!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Gaaargh! Why? Why?! I'm a city banker, for pity's sake! My word should be...the gold standard! I'm a gentleman, not some guttersnipe! Upstanding members of society don't prevaricate!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>He's claiming to have no reason to lie... But is that really the case?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! If we had some evidence to explain why Mr Fairplay might be lying... ...it could turn the tide in this trial completely!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Something to show this man has a compelling reason to lie in his testimony...</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. ...If only we had some evidence like that.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmph. So the defence has nothing?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Whew...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah! Mr Naruhodo! Did you see that?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... He let out an audible sigh of relief. <thought>Does that mean there IS some evidence that would show why he might lie?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think perhaps...we should consult the Court Record again. From Mr Fairplay's reaction, I wonder if there's some evidence we haven't properly examined yet.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes, we ought to look at everything in as much detail as possible!</thought> My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence is ready to present evidence! Evidence that will clearly demonstrate why Mr Fairplay had reason to lie in his testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm afraid, Counsel... ...that before I can allow that to happen, I shall have to penalise you for that reckless about-turn.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... <thought>I suppose that's fair play...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence is ready to present evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">By Jove! Are you sure?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. Evidence that will clearly demonstrate why Mr Fairplay had reason to lie in his testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">GAAARGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Very well. I hereby call on the defence to present its evidence. The evidence that demonstrates a motive for the witness's alleged deception of the court! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">A deception that won't pass muster in a British court of law, my...unlearned friend. Here's to that message being carved into your mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Uwaaaaaagh!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo... I wonder if perhaps there are some details we've overlooked in the Court Record. Do you think it might be wise to check over all the evidence again?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes, it looks like I need to thoroughly examine every piece of evidence we have...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is a list of the debtors who owe money to Mr McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Yes, a list of innocent victims, crippled by the accused's extortion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The point is, among the names of these debtors is your name... ...Mr Bruce Fairplay.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What?! Mr Fairplay! Are you currently indebted financially to the accused?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Arrrgh! No! Well...it's, it's barely worthy of being called a debt...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">According to this ledger, you owe twenty guineas. Not an inconsiderable sum of money, wouldn't you say?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Argh! Well, well what of it?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let's suppose Mr McGilded were to be found guilty of murder... What would become of your debt in that case?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, these documents state that the loan agreement is forged between two individual parties. Therefore, were the creditor - the defendant here - to be sentenced to a capital punishment... ...all outstanding debts which were owed to him would be annulled. They would cease to exist.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Cease to exist?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Fairplay! Is it not the case that you claimed in your testimony to have seen something you never in fact saw... ...in a devious attempt...to annul your debt of twenty guineas to the defendant!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Gugh... GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! ...Mr Bruce Fairplay!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Y-Yes, My Laaarghd?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let me ask you again. And be aware that your answer may have most serious implications upon your future, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Grrr...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Did you or did you not... ...see the precise moment in time at which the defendant is alleged to have thrust a knife into the victim?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">......... .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Your silence speaks volumes! You did NOT tell the truth in your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Alright! Now let's not make a melodrama out of this. Perhaps I did...overstate the truth a pinch.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A pinch?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">But it makes no difference! I definitely remember seeing blood on McGilded's hands! Both of them!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And yet! Only one of the defendant's gloves, which we have here as evidence, is stained!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Grrr... So you keep saying!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">......... I, I wonder if I might be allowed to speak, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Go ahead, Mr Furst.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Well, the thing is...I think I remember seeing it myself, as it happens.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Seeing what?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">The blood, sir. On the assailant's hands. I think... Yes, I'm, I'm almost sure that it was on both of his hands, not just one.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...? WHAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmph. It would appear that we're going to need further testimony from all you witnesses. This time, I would like to know precisely what you DID and what you did NOT see! ...Do I make myself perfectly clear?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Y-Yaaarghsss...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! This is good news! The course of the trial seems to have shifted slightly at last!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! <thought>I might finally have a chance to turn things around here...</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">There was blood on both hands of the assailant. I sincerely and distinctly remember that!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">I remember seeing the knife. And, and I remember seeing both of the attacker's hands with blood on them.</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">I, I d-didn't actually s-see anything myself. No. N-Not until I h-heard that scream.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Anyway, the fact remains! There can't have been anyone else inside that carriage, or we all would have seen!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, lo and behold... ...in truth of fact, not one of you was witness to the crucial moment the crime was perpetrated!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">I, I apologise, My Lord! But... But honestly... Argh! There was no one else inside that carriage, and the man's hands were covered in blood! Grrr... That much incriminating evidence is tantamount to saying we saw the man do it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's...really not what testimony is about.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Let us examine the interior of the omnibus once more. The victim's fresh blood is clearly visible on the seat, corroborating the witnesses' accounts. In other words, there is no substantial - nor significant - change in the facts of the case.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... Very well. Your cross-examination, please, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">There was blood on both hands of the assailant. I sincerely and distinctly remember that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! The evidence tells us otherwise! We have the gloves the defendant was wearing on the night in question in the Court Record.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">I'm well aware of that, sir. But nevertheless... ...I know what I saw and I stand by it! The man had blood on both his hands!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>He's defiant, even in the face of hard evidence. He's steadfastly refusing to admit that he might be mistaken about what he saw... But why?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Your reasoning...is dire.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">One hand or two, the salient point remains unchanged! Minutes after the grim crime, the victim's blood dripped guiltily from the accused's fingers!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">However...I, I suppose you might say that I didn't see the exact moment the stabbing transpired...if that matters.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Don't try to downplay this! Whether or not you saw the exact moment of the crime... ...is a matter of fundamental importance, as well you know!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Argh! But... For crying out loud, we all know that no one else could possibly have done it! I was just - Grrr - trying to save us all some time!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You have a loan of twenty guineas outstanding with the defendant, do you not?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Hmph!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Had you hoped to release yourself from that financial burden by ensuring the defendant was found guilty?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">I...well... Argh! That's not entirely...not...what I was hoping for... Argh! I, I just lost a little guinea or...ten when I backed the wrong horse in the Derby, that's all. Grrr... I was going to win it all back! There's a fixture this weekend that's a sure thing!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah... <thought>A 'little' guinea or ten?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">I'm a banker! No one bats an eye if I borrow a little spending money for the weekend!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... I think you may have revealed rather more about your character than you bargained for, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">This witness's scruples are not on trial here. ...Proceed to the next witness.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Is, is that really how it's supposed to work...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Furst">I remember seeing the knife. And, and I remember seeing both of the attacker's hands with blood on them.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You definitely saw that, too? Blood on both hands?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">...Yes, sir. I mean, I, I know what you're going to say. Only one of Mr McGilded's gloves has any signs of blood on it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's right.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">The thing is...as far as I remember, sir... ...when I looked down and saw Mr McGilded sitting beside the other fellow... ...I don't believe he was wearing any gloves, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He wasn't wearing these gloves?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">That's correct, sir. And I saw the blood on both his bare hands quite clearly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>It's true that the dark-coloured stain on the dark leather gloves wouldn't have been easy to see...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...I should point out that the police officer who apprehended the accused on the night in question... ...reported that there was no trace of blood on Mr McGilded's gloved hands.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>There wasn't blood on his hands...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm. This is puzzling indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This must be significant somehow. I'm sure of it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Beppo">I, I d-didn't actually s-see anything myself. No. N-Not until I h-heard that scream.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You didn't see anything?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Oh, yes sir. That is to say, no sir, I d-didn't. Very sorry about what I s-s-said before, sir. Very sorry, yes. It, it was very wrong of me to m-m-make up stories and s-say I saw him s-stab the man. ...W-Wouldn't you agree, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Hmph! I know what you're insinuating! But I certainly wasn't making up stories!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Still, to say you saw nothing isn't right either, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">No no, sir. I saw n-n-nothing at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Beppo! You were driving your horses! ...At the very least, you, um... You must have enjoyed a good view of London's streets, no?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Oh, please... You didn't even see that?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">It, it was so c-cold that night, you see. It was all I c-could do to k-k-keep from passing out, sir. Yes, my h-h-head was fairly f-frozen solid. S-Sorry to say, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...It would seem prudent... ...to avoid travel on the last omnibus service of London's cold winter nights.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Beppoooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Anyway, the fact remains! There can't have been anyone else inside that carriage, or we all would have seen!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And everything you saw of the incident was through the skylight on the roof of the omnibus?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">That's right. It was fiercely cold that night, but the glass wasn't frosted over.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh yes! I remember I was shivering, it was so bitter.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Which rather begs the question of why the pair of you were sitting on the roof deck in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Well I don't know about this young fellow, but I couldn't enter the cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh? Why not?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">It was locked from the inside. I tried knocking, but no one opened the door.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was locked?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">That's right! And it's a public bus service, for pity's sake! That's not what I call fair play!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Yes, I had exactly the same experience. I tried knocking, but the gent inside just gestured at me to clear off! So I had no choice but to climb up to the roof deck and look down longingly into the warm cabin below.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Well I can assure you I wasn't just looking down! I was glaring! Long and hard! And that's precisely why I can tell you with absolute confidence... ...that if there was anyone else at all in the cabin, I would have noticed!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Unequivocal, I would say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I'm not sure about these two witnesses. Could they really have seen everything inside the cabin through the skylight?</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I suppose they would have had a bird's-eye view from the roof. And birds generally have very keen eyesight, so...</thought> Thank you, that's all clear. What you've said does make sense.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very good. Continue with the cross-examination, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Fairplay didn't see Mr Mason being stabbed at all! That's a hugely significant change in the facts of the case!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And there's something else that occurred to me whilst listening to the witnesses' latest testimony. Two of them are recounting what they saw through the skylight in the omnibus roof.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I know it's a large window and certainly affords a good view of the inside, but... Well, I think perhaps we ought to confirm what they're saying with our own eyes as much as possible.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I mean that we can examine the evidence firsthand. The omnibus is here in the courtroom after all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That's a good idea. And we can consider the witnesses' statements while we're looking around.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Allow me to confirm one thing, Mr Fairplay... You were riding this omnibus... ...and witnessed the events in the cabin through the skylight in the floor of the upper deck. Is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">That's right, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In that case... ...there is a portion of the cabin interior that would have been out of sight from you.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">By golly! Really?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Obviously at this stage we can't say for sure... ...but the possibility cannot be denied... ...that at the time of the incident, there could have been another passenger in the enclosed cabin of the omnibus!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, I will uphold the prosecution's demand. You will identify the area on this cross-sectional plan of the omnibus. Where exactly in the omnibus are you suggesting that this potential extra passenger could have been situated? </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And here's to you never seeing the light of day again!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Aaagh! <thought>Ugh, whatever's in that hallowed chalice, it has a very bitter aftertaste...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">It pains me to say it, Mr Naruhodo, but that was, well... bitterly disappointing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...there's bitterness in the air, it seems...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmph. Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your answer, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Both rows of seats on the roof face in the direction of travel. Whereas the seats in the enclosed cabin face each other. Which means... ...the visible part of the cabin, which passengers on the roof deck can see through the skylight... ...is as I've drawn here.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right, My Lord. As you can see... ...the seat opposite the one on which the victim and his attacker were sitting is obscured from view. In other words, if someone had been sitting on that seat... ...it's quite possible that these witnesses would have been completely unaware of it!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">GAAAAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I concur with the prosecution's rejoinder. In a British court of law, evidence is paramount. I cannot entertain this conjecture, Counsel. That is, unless you're able to put a name to this mysterious passenger to whom you allude?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Can you, Mr Naruhodo?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>I honestly don't know. Who could it have been...? Who could have been in the other seat, which was out of sight from the witnesses on the roof deck?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I understand, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Ugh! I have literally no idea...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">But as a proud citizen of the Japanese Empire... ...you will look to the sky and walk on, making sure all signs of tears are gone! ...Go on!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This isn't just a case of 'going on', Miss Susato.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Al-Alright then! I'll...go on!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence would like to put forward a name.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...You are a fool. That response was a desperate attempt by a man who has no notion of his own limitations. A toast! ...To hard lessons, not yet learnt!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let us not delay, Counsel. The defence is still to name the passenger in the other seat.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This could be it! This could be the chance I've been waiting for to turn the trial in my favour.</thought> On that night... On the night of the murder... ...the person occupying the seat in the omnibus cabin that was obscured from view was...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Whatever so-called 'logic' you used to arrive at that conclusion, it matters not. Because your answer has made one thing abundantly clear... ...the real blind spot is inside your head. ...And it would appear to be unusually large.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... <thought>You could have just said that's not right...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Mr Naruhodo. Our task here is to defend Mr McGilded. And...we are working on the assumption that he is innocent of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, yes, of course. ...Why?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That must mean, then, that there was someone else inside the omnibus with Mr McGilded. The true culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. Exactly what I've been- Oh! Of course! So the two people sitting inside the cabin that the witnesses saw through the skylight that night... <thought>They were the victim...and the real culprit...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">...It does seem... ...as though we've all been making a false assumption.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>The witnesses weren't looking at Mr McGilded at all. Meaning he has to have been sitting somewhere else...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let us not delay, Counsel. The defence is still to name the passenger in the other seat.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The passenger in the enclosed cabin that the witnesses on the roof deck failed to see... ...has to have been Mr Magnus McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Mc...?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Mr McGilded?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What are you talking about, Counsel? That's the name of the defendant!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Lord van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">People talk of those tiny island nations in the Far East as having a learning and culture of their own. ...But I see they use the terms ill-advisedly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What are you trying to say?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Let me explain in terms that even a student of an artless backwater such as yourself might understand... When the bloody scene unfolded, the victim and his assailant were sitting side by side. Multiple witnesses have attested to the fact. It's the very premise on which this case is built!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But that premise...may be wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If the victim really was sitting beside Mr McGilded... ...it creates an inconsistency that can't be reconciled in any way.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What inconsistency, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defendant's gloves, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Both witnesses made the same testimony. They claim that there was blood on both hands of the person sitting next to the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The point is! ...Even in the face of this irrefutable evidence, both witnesses have maintained their stance.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, their testimony remains unchanged.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly. They both adamantly swear... ...that they clearly remember seeing blood on both hands of the assailant. In short! Their memory of events is correct...and their testimony reveals the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was somebody else sitting beside the victim that night. A third party we have yet to identify. And the victim's blood was on that passenger's hands! Both of them!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Obviously...the true culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ex-traordinary! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! What exactly are you postulating?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks"> </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The defence's postulation is just that! Nothing more than conjecture! The witnesses have clearly stated...that they saw the accused!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But when elaborating on his testimony... ...Mr Fairplay said, 'The two of them were wearing hats and I couldn't exactly make out their faces.'</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Hm... Yes... The tops of their heads were obscured by the roof. I could see the rest of them, though.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Yes, that's right. Both gents were most certainly hatted. Hatters do tend to notice such things, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And what particular styles of hat did the two gentlemen sport, Mr Furst?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">......... I'm afraid I...don't remember.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>And you call yourself a hatter...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The style of hat makes no difference! There was no third passenger in that cabin!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How can you be sure?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Because if there had been... ...the accused, Mr McGilded, would undoubtedly have offered to depose the fact!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Unless, that is, you are proposing an even more preposterous explanation? That the accused failed even to notice the presence of the true culprit in the very cabin in which he travelled?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! <thought>He's right... If there was another person travelling in the enclosed cabin of the omnibus... ...it's inconceivable that Mr McGilded would have been unaware of it.</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! There is clearly a simple solution to this 'problem'.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Bring the accused, Mr McGilded, to the stand?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, what say you, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution objects, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">On what grounds?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As a suspect, he will have already made a full statement to the police.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but what if there's some reason why he's unable to speak freely?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Magnus McGilded is no uneducated ruffian.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If it indeed turns out the man has been withholding information... ...you can be sure it will have been a most deliberate act.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... Counsel for the Defence, what is your opinion?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord... <thought>Should we ask Mr McGilded to testify...or not?</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>Ugh...I can't get the words out...</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Susato">I understand, Mr Naruhodo. The idea that Mr McGilded may be hiding something must be playing on your mind. The truth could be far more disturbing than we realised.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...that's all the more reason... ...why there's only one course of action here. To believe in my client. That's what Kazuma taught me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Whenever I'm not sure what to do, I feel like I can hear him guiding me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Then that's what we must do.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes, we need to hear what he has to say in order to find out the truth.</thought> The defence would like to call Mr McGilded to the stand!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... In that case, I would like to hear the opinion of the jury.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Ah, yes, erm... I need a little time to consider this...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">If you ask me, I think we should hear what Mr McGilded has to say.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Get the man out here, I say!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">It would be utterly illogical not to hear his testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">When something needs doing, get it done! That's how I run things at the guild!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Hearing what the patron of my favourite little park has to say? Oh yes, that would be lovely.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Yes! The jury says the man must be heard!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. The court will hear the defendant's testimony. Bailiff! Show the defendant to the stand at once!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>Now, maybe what actually happened that night... ...will finally become clear.</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let proceedings be resumed. Mr McGilded... ...have you been listening to the discourse of the day?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">To be sure I have, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">There are now two matters on which the court desires to hear from you. The first... ...is whether or not there was a third party with you in the omnibus cabin, as proposed by the defence. The second... ...is that if such a person was indeed present, why did you conceal that fact from the police?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">......... Begad, no! 'Tis not in my nature to hide anytin' at all.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Just answer the questions, please.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">The truth of the matter is, I've been desperate about this all along. Do I tell youse all, or keep me mouth shut?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! Tell us what, Mr McGilded?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">The fine fella representin' me is absolutely right. In the carriage on the night with meself and the other man, there was another passenger.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It's true?!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Aye, and 'twas me who helped the little urchin get away after it all happened.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... No, Magnus McGilded. That convenient excuse can't save you now.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">I'm truly sorry, so I am, Lord van Zieks! I'm sure you'll be wantin' to know why I said nuttin' when I was taken in by the police. I do be havin' a very good reason, I assure you.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Which was...?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well, the little child was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and not in any way involved, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">If the police had known the wee one was there... ...they'd have assumed she'd done it. They'd have hauled her into this here courtroom, just like meself. I was only tryin' to spare her that. ...Young hearts and young minds are easily damaged, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... And who was this young child of whom you speak?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">That...I don't know.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You don't know?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Aye, well, the wee ting just happened to be in the carriage that night. I never saw her before or since.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks"> </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">We have absolutely no reason to believe this man. The prosecution calls for the witness's statements to be disregarded by the court.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">You know, I wouldn't be surprised... ...if the urchin isn't here in this courtroom as we speak, listenin' to the proceedings.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is going on?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Be careful, Mr Naruhodo! Cover your face!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Bailiff! Don't let the accused escape! Secure the omnibus!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I hereby call an emergency recess! Bailiff! Ensure the defendant is in custody, and clear the courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We were hurriedly removed from the smoke-filled courtroom by the bailiff... ...amid scenes of chaos as people stumbled over one another in their desperation to flee the chamber. We had no idea what was happening. All we knew was that, for the time being at least, the trial was suspended.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>What on earth just happened in there?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! I've managed to find out what happened!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I was told it was an advanced form of 'smoke grenade'. A type of exploding device that releases smoke.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A smoke grenade? It, it sounds like the sort of thing ninjas use!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">They're just making sure everything is safe now. I think the trial will start again before long.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...who would have done something like that?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The police managed to catch someone who was trying to flee the courtroom, apparently.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Flee the courtroom? Why?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, it's a young girl of around fifteen, I hear.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A young girl? Then, could it be...? ...the other passenger that Mr McGilded was just talking about?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">My thoughts exactly!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So he wasn't lying...</thought> Oh! What's become of Mr McGilded, actually? There are so many things I need to ask him about. But he's not here!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think he was summoned to the prosecutor's antechamber to answer questions. Along with the young girl.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Who is she, I wonder? And what was she even doing here at the trial? <thought>She was taking a huge risk, and for what possible benefit to herself?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">There's another matter that's troubling me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's that?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The 'twenty pence'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm? Oh...um...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">According to the coachman, Mr Beppo... ...he took four passengers that night, at a fare of fivepence each. That comes to a total of twenty pence exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But now it seems there were in fact five passengers.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Which means the figures don't seem to add up again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Er... <thought>She's right. That is strange...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Counsel for the Defence! Kindly proceed into the courtroom! The trial will recommence in five minutes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Thank you, Officer. We'll go in straight away.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well... ...whoever she is, I imagine this young girl will be asked to take the stand and testify now. I really can't imagine what she's going to say. But it could alter the whole direction of the trial!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...We'll know soon enough, Miss Susato.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's...blood, isn't it? .........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Is something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, it's just... Well, this bloodstain is so obvious, that's all. And yet van Zieks has made no mention of it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I suppose that does seem a little strange.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>Why do I have such a bad feeling about this...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is a storage compartment, but there's nothing in here. It's totally empty. ......... <thought>...Something doesn't seem right here, but I can't put my finger on what it is...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's the young girl next to Mr McGilded, look. She must have been the one who caused the disturbance before.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, after that rather eventful recess, the court will now resume the trial of Mr Magnus McGilded. Now then, Lord van Zieks...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My Lord?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I believe you have established the cause of the smoke which veiled proceedings earlier?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It seems to have been an advanced form of 'smoke grenade', of the sort typically employed by the army.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious! The army?! What in the devil's name...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It was an elaborate attempt by a young girl to cloak her escape from the public gallery. But she was caught. ...And now occupies the stand.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... Your name, girl?</line>
<line speaker="???">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are you responsible for the smoke grenade which induced such pandemonium here in my courtroom?</line>
<line speaker="???">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What is the meaning of this deplorable behaviour?!</line>
<line speaker="???">.........</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Ahem! ...If I may, My Lord?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Mr McGilded?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">I tink perhaps I ought to explain here. Why it is that this wee lass was here in the first place, and why she tried to bolt like that. 'Tis all tied up with the events of that night, so it is.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... Very well, Mr McGilded, give your testimony. You will explain to the court exactly how this young woman is involved in the case!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Just what did happen that night? It's not like a defence lawyer needs that information or anything...</thought></line>
<line speaker="McGilded">On the night in question, I took the back seat in the omnibus and promptly nodded off.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... I remain somewhat baffled, I confess. But from what I gather, on the night in question... ...this young girl was indeed riding in the omnibus. Is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">'Tis exactly as the defence counsel said. This lass was the fifth passenger, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. The defence may now cross-examine the witness. Are you ready, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord! <thought>Or rather, no. I have no idea where to start...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">On the night in question, I took the back seat in the omnibus and promptly nodded off.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And when you first got onto the omnibus, were there any other passengers already on board?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">There were not. The cabin was empty, and there was no one on the roof deck, either.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You were the first passenger, as it were. I see...</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Aye, and that's why I took the back side as I did. 'Tis the most comfortable, so it is.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Could you explain exactly what you mean by 'the back seat'?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">By all means. 'Tis how you already described it earlier. I'm talkin' about the seat opposite the one in which the poor gentleman who was stabbed was sittin'. Like I said, 'tis the most comfortable and where I feel most at ease. And of course, I enjoy gazin' through the skylight from time to time as well.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Then, begorrah, a loud thud and a wee scream woke me up with a fair start.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A loud thud, you say? And a scream?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Aye, that's right. How can I explain it...? 'Twas like the sound of someone fallin' to the ground. That sort of noise.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you think it was the sound of Mr Mason falling to the floor having been stabbed?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well now, you'll remember I was asleep at the time. So I wouldn't like to say. And when the sound woke me and I opened my eyes... ...there wasn't a soul to be seen in the carriage but the fella on the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm, you didn't see anyone... But at the same moment...you did hear a scream?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah, from the seats above you on the roof deck, I presume?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Not above me, no, My Lord. 'Twas from inside the cabin. But I wasn't altogether tinkin' about the scream. No...I was too stunned by the desperate sight before me eyes.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">There was a fella collapsed on the floor at me feet. So I sat him up on the seat across from me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You, you sat him up?! The victim, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">That I did. On the seat across from me, as I said. I could plainly see the poor devil was already gone. And you wouldn't leave a dead man just lyin' on the floor now, would you? 'Tis common courtesy, so it is!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I find that a little hard to believe.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Ara, Lord van Zieks! Now why would that be?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You wake to find a man lying dead at your feet in a carriage. Any normal person would hail the cabman. Any...upstanding member of London society, that is.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">......... Well now, as you know...I'm in somethin' of a 'special' line of business.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The business of lending money at exorbitant rates of interest?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Unfortunately, My Lord, not everyone is tankful for the help I offer them, and some would even see me dead. So I do try, where at all possible, to avoid gettin' meself in a tangle with trouble.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Are, are you suggesting you were just going to leave the man there?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Heavens alive, no! I was always intendin' to report it, so I was. Only...I had a mind to find out the whys and wherefores first.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The whys and wherefores?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Right you are. There were some details I wanted to understand before...anyone else got to meddlin'. That wee scream I heard, for example. Wouldn't your good self do just the same? </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm, yes... The scream he says he heard at the same time as the thud of the victim collapsing...</thought></line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Then I turned to find out where that scream had come from. And bless my soul, what did I find?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...I'm afraid I don't understand. I'm sure you told the court that there was no one else in the carriage except yourself and the victim.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">So I did, sir, so I did. ...As far as I could see, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well now, 'tis a queer ting. The wee scream I heard as I woke up... It came from - if you'll excuse the vulgar expression - under me backside!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Under your backside?!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">And when I lifted the seat on which I'd been sitting... ...I found there was a wee cubbyhole there for storage.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! We can examine the omnibus ourselves, remember!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, of course. The whole bus was submitted as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This would be a very good time to have a thorough look around inside!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">And that's when I found her...</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">There was a child in there, all curled up in a ball, hidin' her wee self away!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You say she was hiding herself?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Aye, that's right. 'Twas hard to see in the dim lamplight, but she was all curled up in a wee ball. When our eyes met, well... Me heart nearly stopped beatin' in me chest!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh... You're really overacting this...</thought></line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Still an' all, I pulled her out from under there... ...and sat her on the seat opposite so I could have a wee chinwag with her.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The seat opposite?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">That's right. Just next to the dead gentleman there.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You sat this young girl next to a corpse, sir?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well, as I'm sure I mentioned... ...a gentleman in my position can all too often find himself in mortal danger. So I needed to find out just who this urchin was, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm...</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">And while I was in the middle of talkin' with her, I heard another scream. A fella's voice this time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Presumably that scream was Mr Furst, who was sitting on the roof deck seats.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Right you are again, I would say, sir. Looking down through the skylight, he must've seen this young girl and the gentleman with the knife in his belly.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In other words, the previous witnesses did not, in fact, see you at all, Mr McGilded. What they believed to be yourself and the victim was in fact this girl and the late Mr Mason?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Aye, My Lord. I was, as I tink everyone understands now, sat at the back of the carriage out of sight.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It is certainly plausible... The defendant is somewhat diminutive in stature... ...and readily confused, perhaps, with this young girl.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">After that, of course... ...with the scream from the gentleman over us, the driver realised sometin' was wrong and pulled up the horses.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I do wonder how you must be feeling Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Being the defendant's lawyer, and yet finding myself as stunned as everyone else at his testimony? ...Let's just say it's...trying.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We certainly had precious little time to talk to Mr McGilded before the trial. But we mustn't be dispirited! We must just try to learn all the facts we can!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Haah... When we arrived in London this morning, I didn't see my day panning out like this...</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! No grumbling, even in your head!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Uhhh... How did you know...?</line>
<line speaker="???">.........</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Her name is Gina Lestrade, My Lord. She's a chancer. Earns her crust among large crowds, relievin' people of their purses. What's commonly called a pickpocket.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">This girl here?! A petty thief? Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Is this true...Miss Lestrade?</line>
<line speaker="???">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Miss Lestrade! You will answer the question! ARRRGH! How dare you?! What is the meaning of this?! Ah! The girl! She's gone!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I'm over 'ere.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious! How...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>What was the point in that little sidestep...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gina">I know wot you lot are thinkin'! Grown-ups are all the same! 'This dirty little dipper,' you'll say, 'slipped up an' got caught on the job. She got 'erself backed into a corner, so she knifed the gent!' Go on! That's wot's in yer 'eads, ain't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, not at all! This is a court of law. We're here to determine the truth, not cast- .........</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Look, knives are for cowards. Only thugs use weapons like that. All I need for wot I do is these fingers. I'm a professional, alright? Maybe not in your eyes, but I got pride in wot I do!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let me guess? You don't count smoke guns among 'weapons for thugs'?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh, this? Yeah, this was in a bag I lifted the other day, down where they keep the four-wheeled drags. It's nice, innit? I like the pink best.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Agh! Do not wave that thing in my direction again!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So... ...you admit that you were riding the omnibus on the night in question?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...'Tis alright, lass. You can tell them the truth now.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Alright, yeah... It's just like the Irishman said...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The court accepts this girl, Miss Gina Lestrade, as a valid and significant witness in this case. Accordingly, young lady, we will now hear your testimony, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You will tell the court exactly what happened in the omnibus on the night in question.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...Alright...if I 'ave to...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">So I snuck inside the carriage before they 'ooked up the 'orses, just like always.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, he let you go...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I fail to understand why you would let this street urchin go, Mr McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Oh, 'tis simplicity itself, My Lord. You see, she couldn't possibly have killed the other passenger. I knew that for a fact.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">As I'm sure I said before, sir... ...I was sittin' right on top o' the place where she was hidin' herself.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I think a demonstration is called for.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...This is where I was sat that night.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And the 'cubbyhole' of which you have spoken is underneath this seat, I presume? Hm, yes... It does appear just large enough to accommodate someone of the girl's stature.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Aye, but of course, the wee lass was stuck in there. Because I'd parked meself on the seat for the duration.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">So you see, that's why I let the lass bolt. I knew that if the police found her there, they'd automatically assume she'd done it. But I couldn't live with meself if a young life was ruined when all the time I knew she was innocent.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Even though you must have realised your action would result in your own innocence being called into question?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Not at all, My Lord, not at all!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">I knew in my own heart that I was innocent. So I thought it was worth takin' a punt on my own good name for the sake of this less fortunate lass.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">My goodness!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">What a perfect gentleman!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...My Lord! This...this fine example of a man cannot possibly be guilty of a heinous crime like this. I'm ashamed of myself for ever doubting you, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">With calm, calculated reasoning, one arrives clearly at the truth every time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Saints alive! All six members of the jury consensual in their leaning to a verdict of not guilty?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! This... Well, it must mean...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It must mean what?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That we're victorious!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... We've...won? Are, are you sure?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks"> </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...If the sight of my iron-heeled Wellington offends... pray, do forgive the discourtesy. This really is a consummate example... ...of the one, monumental flaw in British judicial practices.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Where evidence and reasoning should be paramount... emotion rules the day.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Emotion?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The witness's latest statement gives us a clear insight into his true nature.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean, 'his true nature'?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Do you really think Scotland Yard would have made such a glaring omission? After the incident, the omnibus was comprehensively searched by officers of the police. Obviously the interior of this 'cubbyhole', as the witness put it, was included in their investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">'The compartment under the posterior seat was full of the coachman's belongings.' It's noted in black and white here in the police report.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...The evidence has been tampered with. In order to corroborate Mr McGilded's story...someone has unlawfully removed everything from under the seat!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">WHAAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! How could such a devious contrivance possibly have been effected, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Naturally, we must acknowledge the deficiencies of the constabulary in allowing this to have happened. However, I assure you, when the omnibus was wheeled into the courtroom this morning... ...the compartment under the seat was not empty. ...Well, my Nipponese friend?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm? ...Me?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">When the carriage was submitted as evidence... ...doubtless you examined it in fine detail, as would any self-respecting practitioner of the law. Pray, what did you find the condition of the under-seat compartment to be?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Oh, to be sure. The young gentleman will be able to clear this up in a jiffy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Go ahead. You tell the court now, fella... ...how this is all an elaborate excuse by the desperate Lord van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Counsel? Do you have something to say on this matter?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>...How am I supposed to answer? What can I say about the state of that little compartment under the seat in the omnibus?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry. I'm a failure... I didn't look... <thought>Why didn't I examine the omnibus more thoroughly?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Hm... Perhaps I credited you with too much intelligence. It seems, My Lord, that this Eastern initiate is as unreliable as wine from the barrel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Eh heh heh heh heh... Well now, it would seem the argument is moot. And the truth of the matter is there for youse all to see, after all. That there cubbyhole under the seat is as empty as the devil's heart, so it is!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, yes... I'm...fairly sure it was empty. <thought>If I'm honest, my memory about all this is a little hazy.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Hm... As I suspected... It seems, My Lord, that this Eastern initiate has the scruples of a by-street wine merchant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Eh heh heh heh heh... Perfect! 'Tis why the fella is representin' me, after all! He knows just what to say, does he not?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well now, it would seem the argument is moot. And the truth of the matter is there for youse all to see, after all. That there cubbyhole under the seat is as empty as the devil's heart, so it is!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, that we can be sure of, at least.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I really don't know if giving this answer is helping my cause as counsel for the defence... But as far as I remember at least...</thought> When I first examined the compartment... ...I'm fairly certain there were a number of articles inside it, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are, are you sure, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Ara, be whist! What are you saying now, you daft daw?! I thought you were on my side here?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...! What game are you playing? Your task is to defend the man in the stand. Why would you say something to compromise his position?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... ...As the advocate for the defence in this trial... ...I confess I'm still not entirely sure where I stand. But it seems to me... ...that I should state what facts I do know as clearly and honestly as possible.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Interesting.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...'Tis not altogether pleasin', fella.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm simply telling the truth, Mr McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well, don't forget that yer supposed to be representin' my best interests here, lad. Now, then... A fella's memory is a curious ting, and not altogether reliable. No, the court must consider the facts. That there cubbyhole under the seat is as empty as the devil's heart, so it is! D'you think perhaps it would be...in your best interests now to admit that you might have been mistaken?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>Why...? Why do I feel like something's not right here...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... I should like the jury to weigh in on this matter, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">......... That compartment is designed to house equipment used to maintain the smooth running of the carriage. The guild's rules state that omnibuses should be properly and fully equipped at all times. So it certainly wouldn't have been empty on the night in question. ...Beppo isn't that irresponsible. That money-lending fleecer and the pickpurse are lying!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I can't believe I was nearly taken in. The stinking rich are always stinkers. Nothing but cowards, the lot of them!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? <thought>Oh no...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">It's a trick! Of course it's a trick!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...Quite so. I must concur here. With calm, calculated reasoning, one arrives clearly at the truth every time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes, but every time a different truth, it seems...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My Lord, I humbly exhibit the Scales of Justice... Clearly, a verdict of not guilty at this time would be wholly inappropriate.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Counsel. But before we proceed any further, there is the matter of the outstanding cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel for the Defence, begin your questioning of the witness, please.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord. <thought>...What just happened? The whole balance of the trial just shifted almost beyond recognition! ...The 'Reaper of the Bailey' is at work, it would seem...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gina">So I snuck inside the carriage before they 'ooked up the 'orses, just like always.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...you were already in the omnibus before it even set off on its run?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well yeah. I mean, wot's the point of spendin' a joey to make a few bob, eh? That's a rum idea, innit?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I suppose she means there's no point spending money to make money. ...It actually makes sense.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel. May I remind you that this girl is a petty thief? Kindly refrain from entertaining her tenets.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well, that does clear up the little mystery of the fares an' all. Four payin' passengers at fivepence a piece, makin' the twenty to which the cabman testified. ...And one little scapegrace ridin' for free.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">The red conk of a driver always goes for some grub before 'is last run, see. So that's when I slip into the carriage and get meself 'idden under the seat. ...Nice an' easy, right?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But your hiding place is a storage compartment. Full of equipment for the coach...no?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Yeah, there's brushes and buckets and wotnot in there, sure. I always chuck all that out and cram it in a corner somewhere. No one ever seems to bother much.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And yet, according to the report filed by the police officer who first arrived at the scene... ...the compartment was full of such paraphernalia.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...Well, I don't know nuffin' about that. Like I said, I moved all that stuff out so I could 'ide under the seat. That's all I can tell ya.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... It seems we've reached the end of that line of enquiry. Continue...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">But it was a right old waste o' time. I got nuffin' to show for me troubles that night.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'A waste of time'? Why is that?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well, most nights I'm on me own in the God permit at least some o' the time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I, I beg your pardon? Did you say, 'God permit'?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh, yeah. Well that's wot my kind call it. You'd say the 'omnibus', I s'pose. The point is, any normal run, the carriage ain't got no one in it for a while.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And that's when you come out of your hiding place and get away?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">That's it. Only that night... ...this cove was sat on me seat from the start. And 'e didn't budge the whole way, did 'e? Not one inch! I was totally stuck.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Do you mean to tell us that you were present in the carriage for the duration? You were under the seat the entire time while events unfolded in the enclosed cabin?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah. ...Right, Mister?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">To be sure, to be sure. I was as shocked as anyone. You don't expect to lift the cushion you've been sat on and find a child now, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm... So this Miss Lestrade couldn't possibly be the culprit then...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gina">I'll tell ya, you can't see a blind thing in that hidin' place. It's pitch in there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you couldn't see out into the cabin at all?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Not a jot. Most days I push the cushion up wiv me 'ead an' look out the crack. Then I can 'ave a butcher's at who I'm gonna fiddle.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I thought you were a pickpocket, not a butcher...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I mean, I can 'ave a look. The seat I get under ain't as plush as the other one, see. So most o' the time, the passengers plant 'emselves opposite. But for some reason that night, this 'ere Irishman spent the whole journey right over me 'ead!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And for that reason, you weren't able to push the cushion up to peek out. I see...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Truth is... ...I ain't too 'appy in small, dark places. Feels too much like bein' thrown in the clink. But it's the only place to 'ide in them carriages, so it's 'Obson's choice.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Is something wrong, Mr McGilded?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Oh! I do apologise. Was there sometin' the matter, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm just wondering if Miss Lestrade's last comment made something occur to you, perhaps? You seemed to be thinking something to yourself.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Oh, no no. 'Twas nuttin' important. I was feelin' bad for the poor lass, is all. I remember feelin' desperate meself as a young lad, shut up in the dark. 'Twas terrifying, so it was.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see. Yes, I'm sure we can all sympathise. <thought>I'm still scared of the dark now...</thought></line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Aye. And I don't know about yeself... ...but I find that the darkness seems to make everytin' you hear seem that much louder as well.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Yeah... I, I s'pose it does...maybe.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! Miss Lestrade! Did you hear something that night? Anything? An unusual noise, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Nah. Not really. All I could 'ear was the Irishman snorin'.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Bejabers! There's no need to tell the whole world of me foibles, ye little scamp!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What a pity... If only Miss Lestrade had heard something, it might have given us a vital new clue.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... <thought>What should we make of that last statement of hers?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Well, I don't think we can draw any particular conclusions from that.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Very well, if that is the position of the defence.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's the matter, Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well...I don't know... Is that really true, do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It, it must be, surely? She said that she didn't hear anything.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Perhaps that's precisely the point. Could that be important in and of itself?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! <thought>The fact that she heard nothing...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Continue with the cross-examination, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord! I believe the statement just made by the witness is profoundly important!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Profoundly important?! But, but all she said... ...was that she heard nothing!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! Which is the profoundly important point! I'm almost sure of it!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Hm, I'm almost sure that I don't understand the inner workings of your Eastern mind, Counsel. Nevertheless... Miss Gina Lestrade! You will supplement your formal testimony by repeating that last statement, please.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot? Supperment? Wot are you on about? Don't gimme all your fancy talk! I know wot yer tryin' to do! Well it won't work on me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That's right, insult the judge. Always a good move...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Why doesn't she just stick to picking people's pockets in the open, then? I'd say there's some reason that she's not letting on, judging from her demeanour.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gina">So anyways, I was a bit scared, but I 'ad to just stick it out under there. Nuffin' else for it.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I was strainin' me ears to work out wot was goin' on, but all I could 'ear was snorin'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you were straining to hear what was happening the entire time? Since the moment you hid yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Um... Not exactly, no.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well, there was no one in the cabin to start wiv. I could just push the cushion up and 'ave a butcher's to see wot was wot. But then, when I saw this swell gettin' on, I got me 'ead down so 'e didn't notice me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And Mr McGilded sat on the seat under which you were hiding, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah! Would you Adam an' Eve it, eh?! Wot a mug! So then all I could I [sic] do was listen. I was waitin' to jump out o' there as soon as I 'eard 'im leave, see. But would 'e? Not likely! Even though he stopped 'ere an' there, I never 'eard the door open. So I just 'ad to stay put an' listen to 'im drivin' 'is pigs to market. Snorin' like an old dog, 'e was.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm, are there any conclusions we can draw from that, I wonder?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Well, that all seems to make sense.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You took your time reaching that conclusion, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Heh.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>What was that from van Zieks? ...Is he...laughing?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, then. Continue with the cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Lestrade! What you have just told the court... ...is clearly at odds with the facts!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">At odds?! Are, are you sure, man?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Absolutely.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It seems my learned Nipponese friend is not as dull-witted as I feared.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So van Zieks realised it too...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel! I must insist that you bolster your claim with evidence! Or some complicit party's name at the very least!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I expect you to demonstrate this alleged contradiction to the court.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>According to Miss Lestrade, whilst she was hiding in the omnibus that night... ...she heard nothing but the sound of Mr McGilded snoring. But think, Ryunosuke, think! There's something else she should have heard...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Very well, My Lord. Allow me to elaborate... ...on a particular sound that Miss Lestrade could not have failed to hear on the night in question. The sound very clearly explained by the following piece of evidence! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I concur. No sound is apparent to me at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Allow me to introduce you to a sound that will be very real indeed, however. The sound of your death throes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gaaargh! <thought>Ugh... He's right. That was loud...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well then, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Very well, My Lord. Allow me to elaborate... ...on a particular sound that Miss Lestrade could not have failed to hear on the night in question. The sound very clearly explained by the presence of the following person! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I concur. No sound is apparent to me at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Allow me to introduce you to a sound that will be very real indeed, however. The sound of your death throes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gaaargh! <thought>Ugh... He's right. That was loud...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well then, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Hm... I just can't seem to think this through...</thought> Sorry, My Lord. I need to withdraw the allegation for now.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...What you need, Counsel, is to withdraw forever.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So be it. Continue with the cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Then after a while, I 'ear this loud bang. Nearly jumped out me skin, I did. An' the scream just...came out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When you say a 'loud bang', do you mean the noise of someone falling to the floor?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Could've been...I s'pose. I...don't remember so well. Point is, it made me jump.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And you let out a scream, involuntarily?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">That's right. And then I felt the cushion over me 'ead get lighter all of a sudden.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Presumably when the defendant got up in order to help the victim, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Or not. It could equally have been the moment the accused stood in order to stab his victim...could it not?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, girl? Did you see what happened at that crucial moment?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Yeah, I saw it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I pushed up the cushion and 'ad a quick butcher's while I 'ad the chance, didn't I? The Irishman was sittin' up the bloke wot 'ad fallen on the floor on the seat opposite.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That matches Mr McGilded's account, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">But then! The fella suddenly turns around an' looks right at me! I sunk back down again, but it was too late by then. I should never 'ave risked lookin'...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">It's because o' that, this swell found me. ...'E did 'elp me get away, mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And when Mr McGilded discovered you, he pulled you out from your hiding place?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I was scared stiff, I was. 'E dragged me out and sat me down on the seat an' all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Next to the victim, Mr Mason?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah... The bloke 'ad a knife in 'is guts. 'E was...still bleedin'. Then the carriage lurched a bit, and 'e ended up fallin' onto me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ugh... How awful...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Both me 'ands got covered in blood. It made me feel sick as a dog.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Both her hands covered in blood... That must be what the rooftop passengers saw.</thought> After that, I believe you talked with Mr McGilded for a while. Is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...'E asked me some stuff. Wanted to know me name an' wot I was up to an' that. Then I 'eard somefin' from up above. Someone screamed.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Mr Furst on the roof deck, one would presume.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well I didn't want no one seein' me face, so I didn't look up. Then the 'orses were drawn up smartish and this 'ere Irishman says to me: 'Get back under the seat. I'll see that you can get away later.'</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">All six members of the jury had decided the defendant was innocent.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">For one brief shining moment, yes...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's clear that they are all still very unsure. If we could just find some conclusive piece of evidence among this new testimony... ...I'm sure we would clinch the verdict we want!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I think you're right. <thought>And I have this niggling feeling... Something's bothering me...but I just can't quite put my finger on it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">'Thrice-Fired' Mason...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord. The sound that Miss Lestrade cannot have failed to hear... ...is that of the victim, Mr Mason, boarding the omnibus!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Explain your reasoning, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Lestrade, allow me to confirm something. You claimed earlier that you were the first person on board the omnibus. Is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, 'course I was! I got on while the driver was in the pub, didn't I?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And...the next person to board the omnibus was Mr McGilded?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">That it was. Not a soul was in the cabin when I climbed aboard. ...At least, not in plain sight.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you were, to all intents and purposes, alone in the enclosed cabin of the omnibus at that time?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Did I not just say as much? I wasn't travellin' with anyone else, if that's what you mean.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, I saw 'im get on, remember? Through the crack under the seat cushion. 'E was on 'is own for sure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And, from what we've heard, the carriage made a number of stops after that on its onward journey. ...During which time, did you not hear the door opening or closing at all?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Nah, I never 'eard it. That's exactly wot I was listenin' for, weren't it? Waitin' for this swell to leave.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In which case... ...when and how did the victim end up in the carriage?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We know that the victim collapsed inside the enclosed cabin of the omnibus. Therefore... ...Miss Lestrade's statement about what she did - or did not - hear...is at odds with the facts!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Yes. This petty thief's statement was clearly flawed.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Lord van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes... He knew. He knew all too well that there was an inconsistency in Miss Lestrade's statement.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Keh...heh...heh... It would seem words of thanks are in order for my learned friend.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You have demonstrated matters impeccably. This witness, and her...colourful statements... ...are entirely unreliable! Her words are convenient untruths, nothing more!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh! <thought>She, she didn't even say anything!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I didn't want to judge the dear little mite just because she has some rather naughty ways. But I must say... ...I can't abide liars.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">And neither can I!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">M-Mr Foreman!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">I didn't want to judge the girl just because she has some less than salubrious ways. But I must say... ...I cannot abide liars.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Argh!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! That's five jury members leaning towards guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Well, your consideration for others is...refreshing, my Nipponese friend. To the considerable troubles you have spared me! ...Yes, very refreshing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">GAAAAAARGH! What are ye playin' at?! Have ye forgotten who you're workin' for, ye useless Eastern amadan!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">...This is carnage! It's perfect!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Juror number two is the only one left...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! The way this is going...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I know. If we can't find some new way to convince everyone of Mr McGilded's innocence... ...the judge will rule and we'll have lost!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I very much wanted to believe the words of one of London's most respected gentlemen. But... ...those of us in service know we must accept hard truths.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, the witness's last statement seems to have revealed a critical inconsistency in her story. However! If we consider the possibility that her statement is in fact the truth... ...it may shed an entirely new light on this whole case!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What are you saying?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Counseeel!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I'm...sorry, sir? Whatever do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, I will not tolerate you attempting to prorogue my adjudication! Explain yourself at once!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">When the accused boarded the omnibus on the night in question, the victim was nowhere to be seen. Subsequently... ...the carriage door was not heard opening a single time, as testified by the witness in the stand.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And yet the victim's body was found inside the carriage.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">IF this petty thief's words are to be believed... ...how do you explain the victim's miraculous appearance inside the cabin of the omnibus?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... There's only one way to explain how the victim came to be inside the carriage...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Clearly he was in there already from beforehand!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks"> </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Tell me, my learned friend...what was the function of that 'clearly' in your last sentence?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well said, Lord van Zieks. The 'clearly' is troubling me also.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, no! That's really not the point! The point is that the victim must have been in the carriage from beforehand.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Then answer me this... By 'beforehand', to what specific point in time are you referring?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Well...clearly...erm...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I shall have to penalise the defence heavily for this irrelevant rambling.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh...I must learn to ramble more relevantly...</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The penalty is evidently not heavy enough...judging from those Nipponese eyes. So I ask you again...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Obviously, the victim must have been placed in the carriage AFTER he was killed!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks"> </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Tell me, my learned friend...what was the function of that 'obviously' in your last sentence?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well said, Lord van Zieks. The 'obviously' is troubling me also.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, no! That's really not the point! The point is that the victim must have been moved into the carriage afterwards.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Then answer me this... How could a cadaver have been placed inside a moving carriage?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Well...obviously...erm...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I shall have to penalise the defence heavily for this irrelevant rambling.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh...I must learn to ramble more relevantly...</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The penalty is evidently not heavy enough...judging from those Nipponese eyes. So I ask you again...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If the door wasn't opened even once... ...the only explanation is that the victim...entered the enclosed cabin some other way!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But there could be! There's one possibility you haven't considered.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Oh really?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. One other way inside that isn't the door. Another opening, the use of which allowed the victim to 'appear' inside the enclosed cabin!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Alright, Counsel. The defence will identify the location for the court. Here is the omnibus on which the incident occurred. Where on earth is this 'entrance' by which you propose the victim entered the cabin?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Humour me a moment while I consider your answer. You propose that it is possible to enter this omnibus without using the door, despite the windows being fixed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I do, yes...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Well, if you believe such a thing to be possible, pray, do demonstrate. And here's to you remaining inside...until the carriage has taken you back to the port for your inevitable departure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I'd like to stay here and try again, if it's all the same to you...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The answer is obvious! It can only have been the skylight!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I say! The skylight?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The skylight may well be large enough for someone to pass through!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Both Mr McGilded and Miss Lestrade said the same in their testimonies... They each claim to have heard a loud thud, such as the noise made by someone falling to the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, which has already been explained... ...as the sound of the victim falling from his seat having been assaulted with the dagger.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it has. But! Would a man slipping from the seat onto the floor really have made such a loud noise as the witnesses describe? A noise loud enough to cause Miss Lestrade let out an involuntary cry, in fact...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good, good gracious!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Perhaps in fact... ...that was the moment that the victim made his entrance into the cabin. No, let me rephrase that: The victim didn't enter the cabin as such... He fell into it!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How can you be so sure?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Because if the victim had fallen inside through the skylight as you say... ...the passengers on the roof deck would have seen it happen. And yet...not one person made mention of such events in their testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, um... Yes...that's true, but...</line>
<line speaker="McGilded"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Might a humble fella...make a wee comment here?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr, Mr McGilded?!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...To be sure now, the two fellas who were sat on the roof that testified afore... ...said nuttin' of the victim fallin' through the skylight. But...it seems to me, My Lord, that 'tis not so much a case of them not sayin', but... ...Aye... ...'tis a case of them bein' unable to say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">I tink perhaps the two fellas... ...do be havin' sometin' of a compellin' reason not to mention what happened. Would youse not agree...fine ladies and gentlemen of the jury?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Hmmmmmmph!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oh my...my goodness! Surely not...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Those two chaps on the roof...?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">You mean, the ones who stuck that knife in the man were...?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Aaaaaagh!</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Just what exactly are you insinuating here, you...you blitherer?!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">You rotter, he said! You rotter! What are you insinuating?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">This is a flaming outrage! I've a good mind to give you a blinker in a minute!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">He'll give you a shiner in a minute, he said! And so will I!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Fairplay!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">You're effectively accusing me - a city gentleman and well-respected banker!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">And me! A, a very angry hatter!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Suggesting that someone like me could have stabbed that man in the guts, it's...it's... It's a disgrace! It's scandalous! It's...ARGH! I protest! I protest in the strongest possible terms!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">That's right! I protest, too! About you, you rotten scoundrel!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! This is not the time, witnesses! I will not permit this wanton invasion of the stand! Return to the anteroom at once!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">But, but this is beyond reason, My Lord! Argh! It's outrageous!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">It's, it's very hurtful, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My Lord, if I may comment?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Go ahead, Lord van Zieks.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It was the defence that incited this outburst from the witnesses. My learned friend has seen fit to abandon all protocol and accuse the witnesses without proof.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A-Accuse? I, I never intended to...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...It seems, young Nipponese, that your command of the English tongue is wanting.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You proposed to this court that the victim fell through the skylight from the roof deck of the omnibus. That hypothesis cannot possibly stand without the rooftop passengers being aware of the events. You have branded these gentlemen liars! You have intimated their criminal guilt! In our British courts of law, that is what is termed a baseless accusation!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! <thought>I know I was rash to put this idea forward without any actual evidence, but... ...you can't just dismiss it without a second thought!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">What are we wasting time for? Get them to - Hnurgh! - testify!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">I thought there was something fishy about that hat from the moment I laid eyes on the fellow!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">We have to see this matter through now. One way or another!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">If there's filth and rubbish in our midst, we must dispose of it at once!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What's...what's happening, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The spectators in the public gallery are... They're in a complete frenzy!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr Fairplay and Mr Furst...</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Um...My Lord...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You... You will take the stand again and make another formal testimony... ...in reference to the indictment brought by the defence!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Um... Y-Yes...My Lord...</line>
<line speaker="Furst">I, I didn't come here for this...</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>There's no time to think this through. All I can do...is keeping [sic] pushing forward!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">We were the only two people up on that roof deck, dead or alive! ...I can swear to that!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">If anything had happened where we were sitting, don't you think one or the other of us would have noticed?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">In any case, neither of us know the first thing about the victim. We had no reason to kill the man!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">The skylight was shut the entire time, I tell you! We couldn't possibly have opened it!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">If you're so sure the victim fell through the skylight, where's your proof?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... I must say that on listening to this testimony, it is somewhat hard to imagine... ...how either witness could have performed any malevolent act on this open rooftop deck... ...without the other noticing forthwith.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">That's right, you see!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">We're innocent, I tell you!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...Although logically, of course, the argument falls down if the two of you were in collusion with one another.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Eh?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">According to investigations by Scotland Yard... ...the two witnesses share no common dealings.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Hah! Well I don't trust coppers any more than I trust the stinking rich!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Something doesn't feel right here... The trial is going in our favour, really. So why do I feel so uneasy...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel for the Defence, over to you. Your cross-examination, please.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Yes...My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">We were the only two people up on that roof deck, dead or alive! ...I can swear to that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So at no time did the victim, Mr Mason, climb up to join you on the roof deck?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Absolutely not! Dicken!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">No question about it, he said! None at all! ...Oh! But yes! Of course! I, I remember seeing them both! I saw the victim inside the enclosed cabin talking with this man here!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Is this true, Mr McGilded?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Dear me, My Lord, at the risk of repeating meself... ...I boarded the omnibus alone, and nodded off inside almost immediately.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">That's an outright lie! Without doubt, you were engaged in-</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Let me stop you there, fella, and ask... Do you have any evidence at all, at all?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">'Tis all about evidence in the courts these days, so it is. ...You'd do well to remember that.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">......... Argh! I saw you! With my own eyes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This is going so well...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Furst">If anything had happened where we were sitting, don't you think one or the other of us would have noticed?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, it was on the final run of the omnibus, at past ten o'clock in the evening. It would certainly have been quite dark. Perhaps...too dark to see clearly?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Is this some kind of a lark?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Is this some kind of a joke? he said! Is that what this is?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Or perhaps...one or the other of you fell asleep briefly?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Are you fair dinkum, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Are you serious, sir? That's what he said! It's impossible, I tell you!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">I'd give you the keys to the vault if you could fall asleep in that bitter cold. And if you did manage it, your eyelids would freeze shut and you'd never open them again!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's...extreme...</line>
<line speaker="Furst">It was extreme, I tell you! And we had to put up with it because this man had locked the door! Any true gent would have unlocked it and let me in when I knocked!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">I'm, I'm dreadfully sorry about that, young fella. But ye see, I was away with the fairies and I didn't hear ye at all.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">That's a lie! I saw you through the glass! You were talking to someone!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...Now, now, 'twas a cold night, so it was. People do be seein' tings that aren't real in the cold. 'Tis hardly surprising.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Seeing things? Seeing things?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I believe we have reached an impasse here on this particular point.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Ugh! You... You... You...!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Don't take it personally now, lad. If I'm a suspect in this case, then 'tis only fair that you and the other feen are, too. Open and free competition is what a capitalist society is all about.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">...This isn't a competition I should like to be involved in, really.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">In any case, neither of us know the first thing about the victim. We had no reason to kill the man!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...you had never met Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason before?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Oh, lumme! NO! Not once! Never!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">He'd never met the man before, he said! Never!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And you, Mr Furst, had no prior dealings with the victim, either?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">That's right, sir. Hatters don't have much to do with brickmakers, to be perfectly honest, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">No, I imagine not.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">You see? How many different ways can I put this? Neither of us have the remotest connection to the gentlemen who were inside the cabin!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">That's right! This is about motive! And we had none!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Mr McGilded?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Yes, Counsel? What can I be doin' you for?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did the witness's last statement give you pause for thought somehow?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">......... Not the remotest connection...? Is that right now...I wonder.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">What are you insinuating now?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Ah, Mr Fairplay...'tas been too long, so it has.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">If I'm not very much mistaken, I believe 'tis fast approachin', is it not? Your repayment date.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">I, I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Hehe... You borrowed twenty guineas from me, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">At, at an unconscionable rate of interest! You tricked me! It's, it's extortion!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well now...is that a touch of begrudgery, is it? The sort of begrudgery that might motivate a fella to pass his crimes off on another.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">ARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">And young Mr Furst...</line>
<line speaker="Furst">M-Me, sir? Wh-What do you want with me, sir?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">You do be makin' hats for a living, do you not? That there top hat slidin' about on yer head... Is that one of yer own creations, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh! Well, um... I'm still just an apprentice, you understand... I'm learning to find the perfect fit for whatever fine gent walks through the door!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Hehe... The perfect fit, is it? Well...'tis a very...distinctive design, so it is.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Many customers like it, I tell you! They like a distinctive touch!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Customers...such as 'Thrice-Fired' Mason?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Ah...!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">There was a photographic print of the victim submitted as evidence afore, My Lord...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm? ...Oh, ah...this, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">I can't help tinkin' that the poor fella's hat looks... distinctly familiar...wouldn't ye say?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Um... Oh! That's...that's one of my hats!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Hehe, aye, that it is. So it would seem the brickmaker was a customer of yours.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">The sort of customer, I'd wager, you could have had a wee quarrel with over the distinctiveness of the goods.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh, no sir! A-Absolutely not, sir!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...Well, there's really nuttin' more to add. It wouldn't be right to say that the two fellas here haven't the remotest connection to the victim, you see. ...I rest my case.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">You, you little weasel! Argh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>He's better at this than I am...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Gosh, Mr McGilded has certainly been thorough in his research, hasn't he?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">......... Please, don't let me little interruption hold up the proceedings.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>No...motive, hm...?</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Furst">And, erm...well... That's not all, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">The skylight was shut the entire time, I tell you! We couldn't possibly have opened it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Are you quite certain about that? That the skylight was shut the entire time?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">I'm going to lose my block with you in a minute!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">He's going to lose his rag with you in a minute! That's what he said!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Take a look for yourself! Go on! ...You see? It's shut fast now, just like it was on the night!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">So it is. Of course...a fella the size of Mr Mason could likely break right through it, still an' all.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">What?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Just looking at the size of the ting, you understand.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Argh! Now you hold on there a minute, sir! The size of the 'ting' means nothing! Not on its own! Let's consider the bigger picture here, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Let's stop biting our cane, shall we?</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Furst">Um... I, I was riding the omnibus on another occasion, when, um... Well, I broke wind. Loudly. I, I shocked myself with it, as it happens.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... This...is an unexpected confession, Mr Furst.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh! I, I just mean to say... Well the point is, I tried to open the skylight, you see. But - just my luck - I couldn't make it budge. The stench was terrible... Everyone was looking daggers at me, sir. I went as red as rouge, I did!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... Are you expecting me to sentence you?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh! No, sir! The, the point is... The skylight can't be opened! I tried and tried when I was inside that cabin of shame!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to say about that, Miss Lestrade?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Lestrade!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...It opens.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">The skylight. That is wot we're talkin' about, right? ...All them skylights open, dead easy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...More easily than you can load that weapon?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Furst">That's a lie, I tell you! Otherwise, when I broke wind, I, I...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">You can't do it from inside, you mug.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Look, a few weeks ago, I was up on the roof deck of one o' them drags. And I 'ad a great haul! I mean, I 'ad purses comin' out me ears!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Miss Lestrade! This is NOT the forum to be eulogising on the subject of your criminal activities!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...Well anyway, I 'ad a bit of a scare. When I lifted the last bloke's purse, 'e got wise to me. All four of 'em surrounded me, so I couldn't 'op off the bus an' leg it. So wot I did was, I used the skylight. Opened the catch and jumped right through.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, the catch for them skylights is on the top side. That's why you can't open 'em from the cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The skylight opens...from the roof deck?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Bailiff! Climb up onto the roof of the omnibus at once and verify this witness's claims!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh my hat!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...See?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! ...Ordaaaaaar!!! So...it appears that this street girl's statement is quite true.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I don't believe it! The skylight opens... And from the roof deck!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! This could be the clue we've been looking for!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well! ...Counsel for the Defence, please continue with your cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord! <thought>So...the skylight opens... Perhaps I should investigate for myself...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm... The skylight doesn't open, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">So that proves it! We couldn't have kicked the victim down into the cabin below, I tell you! Neither of us could!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Nobody mentioned anything about kicking anyone.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Like I said! These details are little nuggets at best. It's the mother lode we should be looking for!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...But we know now that the skylight does in fact open. And what's more, the catch that secures it is found on the roof deck side.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">This is getting flaming onkus!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">This is getting absurd, he said! Completely absurd!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">That's right! Neither of us even knew the skylight had a catch! If we didn't know, we couldn't have opened it! And if we didn't open it, we couldn't have kicked the fellow down!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Please, where is this idea about kicking the victim through the skylight coming from?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Whoever designed these carriages anyway? Fancy not being able to open the skylight from the inside! What about breaking wind? Didn't they think about that? There's no point having a skylight if it can't spare you embarrassment, is there?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah... <thought>We're really getting off topic here...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...If you actually have a point, pray, do enlighten the rest of us.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Ah! I... Oh, I'll tell you what my point is!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So the skylight was fastened shut before.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But now the catch has been undone, we should be able to open it...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes...it does open very wide, doesn't it? Wide enough to kick someone like you through, certainly, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why someone like me?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wh-What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Look! Just here! Look at this!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's... Without question...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's blood!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Why would there be a bloodstain there?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Surely... ...it can't be unrelated to the case, can it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What an extraordinary place to find a bloodstain.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You would never notice it, unless the skylight was open as it is now. <thought>The fact that there's blood there on the frame... It surely has to imply that whoever was bleeding passed through the open skylight...doesn't it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">If you're so sure the victim fell through the skylight, where's your proof?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm...proof...</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">That's right! I demand to hear it!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">We came here to say what we saw, I tell you! Not for this!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">But you call us both shicers! Brand us as criminals!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">You call us liars! That's what he means! And accuse us of doing it!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...As it stands at the moment...</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">...!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...there's no hard evidence that incriminates yeselves, now is there? I believe we're in much the same position as one another here.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Hm? ...AAARRRGH!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...If I don't crack this case soon, he'll crack his teeth.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Hm...I wonder if these two men really were involved in some way...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I couldn't say. I mean, I don't really know anything about them, do I? <thought>Although by the same token... ...I don't really know anything about Mr McGilded, either. It's so hard to know what to believe here.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think... ...we should try to remember that it's evidence alone that can truly determine the outcome of a trial.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No one can argue against decisive evidence. Including the members of the jury.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you're saying that what we need now... ...is to find a conclusive piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, Mr Naruhodo. Precisely!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...On the night in question, the victim was fatally stabbed in the stomach. And immediately afterwards...the victim's body was pushed through the skylight into the cabin below. Those are the facts. And the irrefutable proof... ...remains clearly visible in the omnibus that stands before us today in this very courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">What?! ...That's...that's utter humbug! Argh! You can't possibly have any evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">No, you can't! I, I mean...we didn't do it, I tell you! It's impossible!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Irrefutable proof? Here, in this courtroom?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I believe everyone would appreciate a little clarification here, hm? Where exactly within the omnibus is this evidence to which you allude? You will point out what it is that proves the victim fell from the roof deck through the skylight!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I think it's clear... ...that my friend has taken the phrase 'it goes without saying' a little too literally. Perhaps, in fact, it goes without saying that he has nothing to say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm sorry, Counsel, but I shall have to penalise you for that deafening silence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...It goes without saying that I'm going to have to rethink my answer...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">By Jupiter! Is, is that... ...BLOOD?!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Argh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This bloodstain proves two things: Firstly, when the incident occurred, the skylight of the omnibus was open.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And secondly... ...the victim was already bleeding when he fell through the opening.</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh my!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And so it follows... ...that Mr McGilded, who was inside the enclosed cabin himself at the time... ...cannot possibly be guilty of this crime!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Nnn...</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Nnnnnn...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">But! But, but! But, but, but!!! But the blood could have sprayed up there when the fellow was stabbed inside the cabin!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">And only found its way to that one particular spot on the skylight? Sure, an' that would be very convenient!</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">And let's keep it in mind that the skylight catch can only be unfastened from the roof deck. I meself wouldn't have been able to open it now, would I?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">But! But, but! But, but, but!!! There's no way to know for certain, is there? If the gent really fell through the skylight, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...Why don't ye have a good look at the floor of the cabin between the two seats, Mr Furst? ...'Tis all too plain, if ye see. There's the aftermath that shows the poor fella dropped from a fair height right there, so it is.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">What? No!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">But, but it can't be! It's, it's all... </line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">My fellow jury members! I think we can all agree that this is clear proof of the defendant's innocence, can't we?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I believe we can, yes, sir. It's clear to me now where the filthy rubbish can be found in this courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">So...they thought they could pull the wool over my eyes, did they?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">.........</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I won't tolerate any of the guild's carriages being sullied with blood! I won't tolerate it!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Oh, I always knew that nice gentleman who gave us that delightful park couldn't have done such a thing.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">On three then, everyone! One...two...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Oh? And what would ye be referrin' to there now, Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... A bloodstain on the frame of the skylight? Such 'evidence'...is null and void!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? Why?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">For one extremely simple reason... ...that smear of blood...never existed!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What...are you talking about? It's there for all to see! And it's clearly blood.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So I can state with absolute surety... ...no such smear of blood existed in the carriage! At least, not until this trial began.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are, are you suggesting, Lord van Zieks...that this stain of blood was...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Fabricated, My Lord? Yes. And while this court has been in session.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">WHAAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Heh...what a palaver... I must say I didn't expect such crude reasonin' from a prosecutor of your standin', Lord van Zieks.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">But I'm Magnus McGilded, a fella known all over the capital for his fine contributions to public life. I don't take kindly to slander. And I'll fight it to the bitter end. Even if it's rollin' off the tongue of the Reaper of the Bailey.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Mr McGilded... ...I realise that this is your first appearance in court as the accused. However... ...I am well aware of your involvement behind the scenes in a great many affairs of dubious nature.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You're very adept when it comes to avoiding getting your own hands dirty. And each time it happens that a case you're involved in is investigated, you 'adapt' the facts.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Adapt the facts? What does that even mean?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">When you wield a fortune the size of Mr McGilded's, however ill-gotten it may be, nothing is impossible. Tampering with evidence, manipulating the scene of a crime, bribing witnesses... I toast your ability to concoct the most convenient of stories, sir.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Tut tut, Lord van Zieks. This will not do, to be sure. Will it now, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm? ...Oh! No!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">I tink it's fair to say...this does all sound like a rather far-fetched excuse by a desperate man. The blood on the skylight didn't exist, ye say?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">But...if youse will all cast yer minds back... ...is it not true that the omnibus there has been in the courtroom the entire time? How could anyone possibly have put a smear of blood in it without the world and his wife seeing? Isn't that right now, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>It's true... The omnibus has been in full view the entire time that court has been in session.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My learned friend...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Here's to hearing your opinion on this matter. ...In your own words.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... As you wish. Could someone have tampered with the omnibus during this trial? If you're asking me, I think...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo? You've fallen silent.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I want to say that it's out of the question. I mean, it has to be, doesn't it? But...for some reason...I just can't bring myself to say it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But the omnibus has been in full view of everyone in the courtroom the entire time! It is out of the question that someone could have tampered with it, surely, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! You, you don't think...? Might it actually have been possible?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>As a defence lawyer...it's my job to advocate for the defendant as best as I can. But still... ...I feel as though there's something even more important at stake here...!</thought> There is no evidence to suggest that the defendant did as my learned friend suggests. However... ...in terms of having the opportunity to carry out the alleged tampering...there is one possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious! Explain yourself, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Yes, there is. It seems my learned Nipponese friend has no intention of running from this deceit.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Deceit?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sure everyone still remembers clearly... ...the recess that we were forced to take. As a result of the smoke grenade fired by the witness currently in the stand, Miss Gina Lestrade.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is going on?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Be careful, Mr Naruhodo! Cover your face!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Bailiff! Don't let the accused escape! Secure the omnibus!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I hereby call an emergency recess! Bailiff! Ensure the defendant is in custody, and clear the courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The courtroom was filled with smoke, and everyone was thrown into confusion. All of us were made to leave this chamber. In that brief interval...under the veil of smoke and in all the chaos... ...it could have been possible to steal inside the omnibus!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...Are you WISE?!What are ye tryin' to pull, ye...ye rotten, feckless gouger!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">F-Feckless...gouger?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Yer supposed to be defendin' me! 'Tis a wicked plot! 'Tis a plot to undermine me, so it is!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">After this courtroom was evacuated earlier as a result of the smoke grenade... ...a number of inconsistencies materialised in relation to the omnibus.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Inconsistencies? Such as...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">To start with, the storage compartment underneath the rear passenger seat. When the police investigated the omnibus, this compartment was full of the driver's items. Secondly, we have the smear of blood on the edge of the skylight. As I have said, that was not present at the start of the trial this morning.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... Unfortunately, Lord van Zieks... ...no one is able to corroborate your claims.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That's true... When the omnibus was first wheeled out, both the storage compartment and the skylight were shut.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Accordingly, I'm afraid to say...we cannot establish with any certainty... ...if this evidence is the result of tampering or not.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Indeed, My Lord. No doubt there was not a single person who saw fit to verify such things.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">About the omnibus... Is there anything else unusual about the omnibus?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>If I'm honest, I don't remember what I examined when in that omnibus. I can't verify this either way.</thought> My Lord! At this moment in time, the defence can-</line>
<line speaker="Susato"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Can point out one other inconsistency. A mark that surely could not have been present at the start of the trial.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato! What are you doing?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I examined the omnibus with you, don't forget. There's something that seems out of place...compared to how the carriage looked originally. That's what we need to identify now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There is one further inconsistency. A mark that surely could not have been present at the start of the trial.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What?!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">What in the devil's name are you goin' to say now?! If, if you dare to betray me, ye little maggot...ye'd better start watchin' yer back!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Grrr...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This trial keeps swinging one way and then the other. I have no idea what's the truth and what's deception... What am I supposed to believe here?</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Judge">I shall have to ask you to elaborate, Counsel. Where exactly is this alleged mark that you claim appeared at some point during the trial? </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If you mean the mark of sweat around your collar... ...that has certainly gained prominence over the course of proceedings.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It would appear you are clutching at straws in desperation, Counsel. As evidenced by your abundant perspiration.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's a cold sweat, My Lord...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We're so close, Mr Naruhodo! It's something that Lord van Zieks appears to not have noticed. That's the correct answer here!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>In other words, something that the prosecution hasn't mentioned...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If we consider that the victim fell through the skylight onto the floor of the cabin... ...you would certainly expect to find signs of blood where he landed. But as far as I recall... ...the bloodstain on the cabin floor was not there when the omnibus was first brought into the courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good Lord! Yes...I do believe you're correct, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... ...Well said. Although as advocate for the defence, one might say that was a very careless slip of the tongue.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I believe that bloodstain on the floor is a decisive piece of evidence. But if the question is whether that evidence is genuine, or whether it was unlawfully fabricated by someone... ...I feel compelled to admit that there's at least a possibility...that the evidence is fake!</line>
<line speaker="???">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRGH!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">This trial...is over.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr McGilded...?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">I've done everytin' I possibly can to cooperate with the court, but... ...'tis all over now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But! But you're the defendant!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">'Tis over, I tell ye!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Memory...recollection...what people tink they saw... 'Tis all a nonsense! Facts are what counts! And the fact is, that bloodstain is there! Now!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Well...</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">And over the course of this desperate trial, long and extremely drawn-out as it has been... ...that good-for-nuttin' Reaper of the Bailey has failed to present any decisive evidence at all!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...I'm scandalised, so I am. I'd thought better of Lord van Zieks. Well? My Lord?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... ...I must concur with the defendant. The unaffirmed recollections of an individual cannot stand as evidence. At this moment in time, the particular bloodstain in question is very much in existence. And in the absence of any credible method by which to prove its alleged previous non-existence... ...I regret to say that it would be improper for this trial to continue.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Your, Your Lordship can't be serious.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Lord van Zieks, what is your position?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... The prosecution, My Lord... ...has no further witnesses or evidence to present.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. In that case, as I believe we have explored every possible avenue in this matter... ...I shall proceed to my adjudication. As a formality, I am of course obliged to confirm with the defence first...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>What formality?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">As things stand at the moment, it would seem... ...that Mr McGilded will be found not guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Which would mean...we've won.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Is that really the right outcome here? Is it really alright for the trial to come to an end now, with all these unexplained inconsistencies?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel for the Defence...your closing statement, please.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Yes, My Lord. The defence believes...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As Mr McGilded's legal representative... ......... <thought>...I can't breathe... The air in here is stifling... But I'm this man's defence lawyer. There's only one thing I can say in this situation...</thought> ...I believe the defendant, Magnus McGilded...to be innocent of the allegations brought against him.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Here's to you, my Nipponese friend, and the most abject closing I have yet to hear in a court of law.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...Eh...heh...heh heh heh... Wah hah hah hah hah! Oh, 'twas a grand decision to appoint you as my lawyer, so it was! A grand decision!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">You've saved one of London's most...influential gentleman [sic], fella! Ye should be proud of yeself!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I am here in this courtroom today to advocate for the defence of my client, Mr McGilded. However... ...at this moment in time, I cannot in all good conscience attest fully to the defendant's innocence.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What are you saying, man?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Without any question, there is no conclusive evidence to prove that the defendant is guilty. However...there is also no conclusive evidence to prove that he is innocent.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good... Good gracious me! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! This, this is unprecedented behaviour, Counsel! A defence lawyer calling the accused's innocence into question?! Are you of sound mind?!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...Eh...heh...heh heh heh... Wah hah hah hah hah! Oh, 'twas a grand decision to appoint you as my lawyer, so it was! A grand decision!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">I must say, I didn't expect quite such an excitin' spectacle at the end there, but still...</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Here, have this for your troubles!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Your job here is done, fella. And some fine work ye've done, so ye have.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wh-What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">'Tis just as the Right Honourable gentleman so succinctly put it afore... The trial can't go on any more. And yer closing statement there was - how did he put it now? - nuttin' more than a formality.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">I, I really don't know what to make of all this.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Was the evidence we've seen genuine? Or...was it fake?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">His Lordship would be fuming. Any unsightly rubbish should be disposed of promptly, as I said.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">.........</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">The stinking rich are always guilty of something! You - Hyuurgh! mark my words!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I feel terribly ashamed that I ever doubted that lovely man who gave us the lovely park.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... Now that proceedings have unfolded in this way... ...I am compelled to declare a premature end to this trial. Furthermore... ...the court must accept the defendant's plea.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">...I tank you kindly, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... I hereby pronounce the verdict of this court...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But! But we still haven't determined if the bloodstain in the omnibus is genuine or not! We don't know if these witnesses are telling the truth or a pack of lies! We have no idea about the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... Lord van Zieks...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...My Lord?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The case made by the prosecution was flawed, plain and simple.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If indeed the omnibus presented as evidence was tampered with... ...the prosecution is at fault for allowing such a disgraceful perversion of justice to take place.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... My sincerest apologies, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...wait! When we were evacuated from the courtroom, Lord van Zieks ordered the evidence to be secured!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm afraid the prosecution cannot shun responsibility in this matter.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's...so unfair!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The culpability of the defendant has not, at the present time, been established by this court. Consequently... ...the jury will not be required to proffer judgement.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">What?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well, Lord van Zieks...it's been a pleasure, so it has. And as for you, my dear fella...I couldn't have asked for a better defence!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Do you mean to tell me this has all been a grand waste of time?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">'Tis the law of the land, my good man. If ye'd like to pursue this matter further, ye can always go ahead and try to change the law.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Magnus McGilded...</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Good grief! Ye've more to say to me, have ye?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Just one thing. ...A warning. This is far from over.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well, sometin' to be lookin' forward to then! Wah hah hah hah hah!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I hereby pronounce the defendant, Mr Magnus McGilded...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">With the courtroom in pandemonium for the second time that day, the judge delivered his verdict. And my first ever trial in Great Britain came to an abrupt end... ...with the defendant being found not guilty - ostensibly a victory for us.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That certainly was a long trial.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...yes, it was.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Your first ever trial on foreign soil, and your first victory. It was a wonderful performance. My heartfelt congratulations.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And to you, Miss Susato. Thank you for your assistance. ......... I, I suppose we should be happy.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The trouble is, we're still completely in the dark about what actually happened.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, we didn't have enough time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...But isn't it wrong? I mean, who was actually responsible for Mr Mason's death? We don't even know that!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">'The sole aim of the defence is to obtain a verdict that exonerates the defendant.' You carried out your duty to perfection.</line>
<line speaker="???">...Aye, that you did!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr McGilded... <thought>Ah, and that girl is with him, too...</thought></line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well, it seems the stories are true.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh? What stories?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">About the six enormous fireworks they do be lettin' off when there's a verdict of not guilty. I'm sure youse must have seen them now. Spectacular, wouldn't ye say?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, definitely.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">I'd heard it was a sight to behold, and to be sure it was! And I've you to tank...I suppose. For havin' an opportunity to see it. Wah hah hah hah hah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, I don't know about that. I'm not sure I really did anything.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">What on earth are ye sayin', fella? How did I walk out of there a free man then?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I don't think it was so much thanks to me as...down to your...planning.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">......... Yer a straight-talkin' fella, aren't ye? I must say, ye had me astray in the head there once or twice. But yer young and headstrong! Wah hah hah hah! Ah, 'tis water under the bridge!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Congratulations, Mr McGilded, on having your name cleared.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>But nothing's resolved...</thought></line>
<line speaker="McGilded">There's only one ting that matters to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh? </line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Aye... They've all seen that I didn't do that odious and absonant deed! 'Tis grand, is it not?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...suppose it is.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Now the fine fellas of Scotland Yard can take matters in hand and sort out any wee details. They'll see it for what it is! They'll get to the truth! I've absolute faith in them, so I have. After all... ...I do be providin' a good number of their wages with all the taxes I pay. Wah hah hah hah hah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>It's not that funny...</thought></line>
<line speaker="McGilded">So then... ...as we agreed aforehand...one thousand guineas for yer troubles, fella.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, no no! I couldn't possibly accept that much!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Ara, be whist! Yer a humble people are ye, you from the East? Well...if you insist. But have this, still an' all. Ye deserve a reward.</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Mr Magnus McGilded! Everything is ready, sir. If you'd like to follow me into the courtroom...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Into the courtroom?</thought></line>
<line speaker="McGilded">What's this, Officer? 'Tis sooner than I was led to believe.</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">I hope it's not inconvenient, sir. There were some changes to the schedule.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well, I must be makin' tracks now. 'Tis time for the inspection.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? What inspection? </line>
<line speaker="McGilded">They're goin' to examine the omnibus again, so I'm told. I asked if I could be present for it meself.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">They're going to examine it again? Now?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Naturally, I'm under no obligation to take part in any more of this matter now. But as an upstandin' member of London society, I do be doin' me best to help where I can. 'Tis a gentleman's duty, so it is.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">So then, fare thee well! 'Twas an absolute pleasure meetin' youse. I hope ye have a whale of a time while yer studyin' here in Great Britain!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>And there he goes...a free man...</thought> Oh! <thought>I forgot she was here, too.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gina">...Don't move!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Whereas I want to say, 'Get a move on!' She really does take forever to load that thing...</thought> Miss Lestrade...would you mind putting that thing down?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... ...Yer a grown-up...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">And I 'ate all grown-ups. .........</line>
<line speaker="???">Ah! There you are!Naughty, naughty, running off like that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Is this some kind of picnic? Who's this little girl now?</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">And taking that with you as well! I was looking forward to the trial run of my experimental smoke grenade launcher!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...Hah!</line>
<line speaker="???">Oh! Do you want to play? You won't beat me!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Grrr...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, excuse me, but...who are you?</line>
<line speaker="???">Oh, good day to you! I'm...well, the inventor, I suppose, of that machine.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The inventor?</line>
<line speaker="???">Well, normal smoke grenades are so dull, don't you agree? White, white and more white. If you have to be shrouded in smoke, it could at least be a pretty colour, I thought to myself!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Do we have to be shrouded in smoke, though? At all?</line>
<line speaker="???">I just took my eyes off it for a moment whilst I was changing onto a different omnibus, and she pinched it! Luckily, I fitted it with a telegraphic beacon.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A tele-whatsit what? <thought>I have no idea what this girl is talking about.</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Anyway! You're coming with me now! Back to my laboratory!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot? ...Wot for?</line>
<line speaker="???">To apologise of course, silly! To my technician.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot? You mean, say sorry?</line>
<line speaker="???">You must say sorry when you've done something wrong. Surely an adult has told you that before?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">An adult? Hmph! I don't listen to no adults!</line>
<line speaker="???">Come along then, follow me.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Fine, 'ave it your way.</line>
<line speaker="???">Oh good! You see, I knew you'd want to do the right thing in the end!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...I'm fairly sure that what she wants is not to get shot by that massive gun of yours!</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">We'll be leaving now then. Bye-bye! I'm so sorry for all the fuss!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>She was a lively one...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well...do you think perhaps we ought to be on our way now, too?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, you're right. But... ...where to?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We haven't had time to find a place to stay. No sooner had we arrived in London than we had to rush here. All our travelling cases are still with the bailiff.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Hmmm... I was originally planning to spend today in search of lodgings.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But at this late hour in the day, I'm afraid we may be out of luck.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Don't worry, though! I have a plan! If the worst comes to the worst, I've heard of a lovely park where we could spend the night!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please tell me you're not thinking of McGilded Park.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I know it may be a little chilly at this time of year, but... our youthfulness will see us through!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm...not so sure about that. I think a midwinter London night will freeze a young person solid just as easily as an elderly one.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Oh dear. That doesn't sound agreeable.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Now I'm starting to regret turning Mr McGilded down. That one thousand guineas would have paid for a lovely warm room...or mansion.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Man 1">What's going on?</line>
<line speaker="Man 2">Get the fire brigade!</line>
<line speaker="Man 1">Water! Bring water, quick!</line>
<line speaker="Inspector">What the... How did this happen?</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">I dunno, sir! By the time I got 'ere, it was already engulfed...</line>
<line speaker="Inspector">No one was supposed to be allowed in here before we started investigatin'! No...oh good God! There's, there's someone in there!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ooh...this...this can't be...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I can't find anything out of place.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I've investigated thoroughly, but... I can't find anything out of place.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The witness's last statement is clearly at odds with this piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see the connection.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And for heaven's sake, would you kindly desist from that wide-eyed panic-stricken look you are wont to wear!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...But it's the only panic-stricken look I know...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let's just consider the implications of that statement for a moment, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What implications, Counsel? Nothing strikes me about it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...um...exactly! There's nothing striking about it!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, what does strike me is your propensity for the inane, however.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh... I need to clear my head and come at this again from a different angle.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That reveals a damning inconsistency, that last statement!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Damning, you say? As I look at you, Counsel, I see your trembling hand, your pallid expression and your perspiring brow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It seems to me THAT is the damning inconsistency here. With the misplaced confidence of your assertion!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh... He has a damning tongue...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Judge">...You invite it, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's clearly something odd about that last statement made by the witness!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">There is clearly something odd here indeed. Your behaviour, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Haha! Please, d-don't mind me...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That would be significantly easier if you would lower your hand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I won't lower my hand until I prove my client's innocence! ...As long as it's quite quick.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Well, Mr Beppo?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">Oh? Me, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to add in relation to that last statement?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">......... Well, sir. There is j-just one thing, sir. I was w-w-wondering what's going to become of m-my omnibus, sir. After the t-trial.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Beppo">I can't help w-w-wondering... Will no one want to ride in a c-cursed c-carriage someone was k-killed in? Or w-w-will everyone want to ride in it? Yes, the c-cursed c-carriage could be an attraction, maybe... It c-c-could be a s-sink or swim moment for me. Oh yes, I think it w-will be!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Well, if you could just focus on the testimony for the time being, please...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...If I may, Mr Fairplay?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">What are you fossicking for now?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That last statement appears to have given you pause for thought.</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">...Not really.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... By the way, you always seem to be looking to the side, one way or another. Do have some...affliction?</line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">...Not really.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>He's 'not really' willing to say anything, it seems...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Fairplay">It's none of your business anyhow!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Furst!</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh! How can I help you, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That last statement... Did it trouble you in some way?</line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh! Um...not particularly, sir, no.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>If anything... ...he's troubling me with that hat of his. Has he greased his head?</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Furst">Oh dear, sir. I hope my hat's not troubling you, sir. I'm still just an apprentice, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo... Even the witnesses can see what's going through your mind. You really must be more careful.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... I wish it were that simple...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly contradict each other!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">As the foreman of the jury, I refuse to accept this outlandish interjection!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">There is no contradiction here, you young stripling! None whatsoever!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I agree. You will refrain from personal attacks on the jury based solely on your own frustrations, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...The really frustrating thing is, I thought I'd identified a genuine discrepancy there...</thought> </line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's important to take your time in considering which statements contradict which others, Mr Naruhodo. I suggest you listen carefully to all six jurors again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Lestrade!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did something spring to mind when you heard that last statement, perhaps? No, it seems not. Forget I asked.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let me ask you something, Mr McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Oh? And what would that be, fella?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to say about that last statement?</line>
