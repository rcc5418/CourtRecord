Episode 2Turnabout Corner
As long as we draw breath, the Wheel of Fate turns... Spinning big crimes and little crimes together. And when the Wheel stops... You die.
June 15, 9:12 AMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Apollo:
(Two months have passed since Mr. Gavin's arrest. My first trial, and I lost both my mentor and my job. Yeah, I'll admit it. I was screwed. But even when I hit bottom, I told myself I'd never come here. Honest. Here being the legendary Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices. OK, Justice, time to stop trembling.)
???:
Ah! You must be here for the interview. Right this way.
Apollo:
Huh?
???:
Hello there! You've found the Wright place! Welcome!
Apollo:
Uh... Ah... (What's with this girl!?)
???:
Well now, shall we begin?
Apollo:
Begin... what?
???:
Right, first things first... Any special talents?
Apollo:
Erm, talents?
???:
Yes, well, you must have at least one!
Apollo:
Well... Uh... I guess... Defending?
???:
"Defending"... An unusual talent, but it'll do. With a little jazzing up, of course.
Apollo:
Y-You think so...?
???:
Let's give it a go, shall we?
Apollo:
Huh?
???:
Go ahead! Show me! Defend! Just give it all you've got. Don't hold back now!
Apollo:
Wh-What are you talking about? I can't just "defend" here!
???:
First lesson: A professional can perform anywhere!
Apollo:
...Thanks.
???:
We want people to be laughing with us... ...not at us!
Apollo:
...Thanks. But I'm not sure why they should be laughing at all.
???:
What...? What exactly do you think you came here to do?
Apollo:
What? Um, defend... No?
???:
... Excuse me, but do you know where you are?
Apollo:
Huh!? The Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices, right?
???:
...Oh. I was afraid of that. Don't worry, you're not the first.
Apollo:
Look, what's going on here? Who are you? I came here to meet with the person in charge...
???:
Well, you've apparently made no fewer than two mistakes.
Apollo:
Mistakes? But I got a call from Mr. Wright this morning!
???:
Perhaps you should go read the sign out front again?
Apollo:
What's there to read!? Look, it says right there... ...Oh. Why does it say "Wright Talent Agency"...?
Trucy:
Welcome to the Wright Talent Agency, where you've "always come to the Wright place!" I'm Trucy Wright, CEO. I'm a magician.
Apollo:
(It all came flooding back... The trial... That girl...)
???:
Hello, sir. Please, pick a card.
Phoenix:
That's right. She's my daughter.
Apollo:
Trucy... Wright.
Trucy:
Here, check out our flyer! So... what's your name?
Apollo:
Apollo... Apollo Justice, attorney at law.
Examine
Bookshelf
Apollo:
All these legal books must be Mr. Wright's leftovers... ...There's a lot of unrelated books in here, too. "One Trick a Day"... "Magic for Idiots"... You'd think a pro magician would aim a bit higher.
Charley the plant
Trucy:
Ack! Don't touch Mr. Charley!
Apollo:
"Mister" Charley...?
Trucy:
He's been in this office much longer than I have! Daddy's mentor had a great fondness for Mr. Charley. He's lived here since Daddy was a rookie attorney!
Apollo:
Huh.  (Mr. Charley... riiight.)
Trucy:
Now I take care of him!
Hula hoop
Apollo:
That's one of those hula hoop things everyone was crazy about way back when.
Trucy:
Really? I had no idea these were that popular!
Apollo:
I'm not so bad with one myself, actually.
Trucy:
Eh!? I-I'm still learning... So you can really make someone levitate with it? Show me!
Apollo:
Huh!? I-I have no idea how! (It's just a normal hula hoop, isn't it?)
Magic split box
Apollo:
A strange, split box leers at me from the wall. Um, is this one of those boxes for cutting people in half?
Trucy:
That's right! This cabinet is used for an illusion called the "Zig-Zag"!
Apollo:
I've seen one on TV... But why is one just sitting here in your office?
Trucy:
Oh, it's a little big for me, you see. So I'm using it as furniture. Hats in the top, shirts in the middle, and pants down below! I think it's a nice touch... don't you?
Apollo:
(It's not exactly what I'd call a "welcoming" decor.)
Photograph
Apollo:
An old, sepia-tinted photo of a man in a silk top hat.
Trucy:
That's my favorite magician! I want to be just like him someday!
Apollo:
(Sure, nice... Guess it's good to have a role model. Even if he's gotta be well over 100.)
Trucy:
How rude!
Piano
Apollo:
There are all sorts of strange paraphernalia sitting on top of the piano.
Trucy:
Those are my magic props! Practice, practice, practice! A professional never leaves their weapons far from reach!
Apollo:
But you can't play the piano with all this junk on it.
Trucy:
Oh, no one plays here anyway. And the neighbors complain.
Apollo:
(I guess Mr. Wright really can't play...)
Silk hat
Apollo:
A blue silk hat, just like the one Trucy is wearing.
Trucy:
Oh, that's just for show. Don't wear it, please!
Apollo:
(Last thought from my mind, honest.)
Trucy:
I put it there so clients can see it and know who I am. Nothing says "magician" like a silk top hat!
Spaghetti
Apollo:
Whoa! That fork is floating! ...Not. Why do you have a plate of plastic spaghetti here?
Trucy:
That right there is the whole reason I became a magician!
Apollo:
Do tell.
Trucy:
I saw a plate just like that in a restaurant once. The floating fork looked so real! That's when I knew... Someday, I'd make magic more amazing than that spaghetti!
Table
Apollo:
That table... doesn't look very sturdy.
Trucy:
You've never seen one of these? It's a magic table!
Apollo:
So, like, you make this teapot disappear?
Trucy:
So you might think! But that's not it... Before your very eyes, the contents of the pot change! ...From Earl Grey to Darjeeling!
Apollo:
Kinda hard to see the difference, I'd think...
Move
Apollo:
(What's up with this "Wright Talent Agency"? Guess I'll talk to her and find out what I can.)
Talk
Wright Talent Agency
Apollo:
So... Is this really a talent agency?
Trucy:
You bet! Daddy started it seven years ago, when he quit law. Of course, we only have two people signed up right now.
Apollo:
Two people... Does that include you?
Trucy:
Trucy Wright, Magician Extraordinaire! I've done a lot of stage shows! Paid, too! I am a professional, you know.
Apollo:
Er... right.
Trucy:
Promise you'll come to one of my shows, OK? Let's see... Oh, and the other person our agency represents is... Phoenix Wright, Pianist Extra Ordinaire!
Apollo:
Your dad, in other words. Didn't he say he couldn't play the piano?
Trucy:
Our agency doesn't see that as a problem. Why, there are many magicians who can't do magic!
Apollo:
At least you're optimistic, I'll give you that.
Trucy Wright
Apollo:
So you're his, er... you're Phoenix Wright's daughter?
Trucy:
That's right! After Daddy quit law seven years ago... ...I promised I would keep him fed! So I'm kind of his sugar daddy! Get it?
Apollo:
No.
Trucy:
I'm in charge of this whole office, too. Pretty amazing for a young lass of fifteen, wouldn't you agree!?
Apollo:
F-Fifteen? Uh, how old is Mr. Wright?
Trucy:
Daddy? Oh... he's 33 this year.
Apollo:
...I'm sure there's a good explanation. (I hope...)
Trucy:
?
Phoenix Wright
Apollo:
Um, about Mr. Wright giving up law... It was because of that incident seven years ago, wasn't it...?
Trucy:
Eh? You know about that!?
Apollo:
Not the details. I remember the news, though. It was a big deal.
Trucy:
So I hear. I was too young to understand what was going on. I'll ask Daddy about it next time I get a chance.
Apollo:
Daddy, right... That reminds me. About Mr. Wright... He gave me a call this morning to come in.
Trucy:
Daddy's not here right now. He's in the hospital.
Apollo:
The hospital!?
Trucy:
Yeah. He's on strict bed rest until he gets better.
Apollo:
Wh... What!?
Present
Attorney's Badge
Trucy:
Oh, I've seen one of those before! That's an attorney's badge. It looks just like the one Daddy used to have. Now if I take this badge... And do this, and this... See! It's gone!
Apollo:
H-Hey! My badge! What'd you do with my badge!?
Trucy:
No need to worry! Just look in your pocket!
Apollo:
Huh! No way... My pocket? (Wait a second... There's something in there!) ... It's a flyer for your agency!
Trucy:
And here's your badge. You can have it back now.
Apollo:
(That's the last time I let her touch anything of mine. Period.)
Examine evidence
Attorney's Badge
Back side
Apollo:
There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it.
After clearing all Talk options:
Apollo:
OK... Which hospital is Mr. Wright in? I'll pay him a visit.
Trucy:
Oh, the Hickfield Clinic. It's quite close.
Apollo:
Right. Well, I'll be going now. And I'll, uh... give this showbiz gig some thought, OK?
Trucy:
Wait! I'll go with you!
June 15, 9:45 AMHickfield Clinic
Apollo:
(So... this is Mr. Wright's hospital...)
???:
Eh? Visitors are ya? Hrmm?
Apollo:
Uh, yeah. Are you the... doctor?
Hickfield:
Ayup. Dr. Hickfield's the name. Eh he he.
Trucy:
Good morning, Doctor!
Hickfield:
Oh, hiya there, Trucy. Cute as ever! Eh he he.
Trucy:
Is... this Daddy's room?
Hickfield:
Oh yah. 'Cept he's gone for a mornin' checkup. Be back soon. How're you, Miss Trucy? Got any places you'd like... examined? Eh heh...
Phoenix:
Doctor... the nurse was looking for you.
Hickfield:
Why, if it isn't the Daddy o' the cutest lil' thing in town! Hrm. Hrmm. Guess I'll be off then. Eh he? Later, Trucy.
Apollo:
Wow, what an odd bird that guy was.
Phoenix:
Good morning. Didn't expect you so soon, Apollo.
Apollo:
Mr. Wright...
Examine
Bottle
Trucy:
Aaaah! Daddy! You snuck some grape juice in again!? The doctor said you weren't supposed to drink that here!
Phoenix:
Trucy. Look at the label.
Trucy:
... Oh. "Deep Sea Mineral Water". That's fine, I guess.
Phoenix:
I switched the labels. Don't tell Trucy, 'kay?
Apollo:
(What can I say, the man loves his grape juice.)
DVD stack
Apollo:
A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. "The Steel Samurai", "The Nickel Samurai"... "The Pink Princess", "The Zappy Samurai: Electric Bugaboo"... They're all children's action hero shows...
Phoenix:
This "kid" I know keeps sending them to me.
Apollo:
Huh. Like a niece or nephew?
Phoenix:
...Something like that.
Apollo:
Quite the collection. This kid's parents must be really generous with their allowance. (Funny, Mr. Wright doesn't seem the type that kids would like.)
Hospital bed
Apollo:
Mr. Wright's bed... It's really messy.
Trucy:
Look how messy this is! You're just hopeless without me, aren't you, Daddy?
Apollo:
(Yikes! She's attempting to clean up! Look out!)
Phoenix:
Ah ha ha. You got me. What can I say? I was raised in a barn. Try not to let word get out, Apollo. If you don't mind.
Apollo:
(Yeah, it might ruin your illustrious career pretending to play the piano.)
Piano
Apollo:
This looks like a child's toy piano.
Phoenix:
Gotta practice. Wouldn't want my fingers to get stiff. A pro always keeps his weapon close at hand. Shall I play you a tune?
Apollo:
Uh... no thanks.
Phoenix:
Ah, how unfortunate. I so rarely get a chance to play.
Television
Apollo:
What's that on TV? Looks like some sort of action hero show...
Trucy:
Oh, I know that one! That's the Sniffling Samurai! His "Booger Flick" attack is a big hit with the grade school crowd.
Apollo:
I had no idea you liked this kind of stuff, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Well, what else is there to do when you're stuck in bed? Besides, the episodes will just keep piling up if I don't keep up, you know?
Apollo:
Um... yeah. (Try not buying them.)
Phoenix:
Now's the only time I get to watch and write up my reports.
Apollo:
Your... reports?
Phoenix:
It's a long story. Like a lot of things, actually.
Talk
What happened?
Apollo:
So... what happened?
Phoenix:
...Who could have imagined it? Me, victim of a hit and run...
Apollo:
A hit and... You were hit by a car!?
Phoenix:
Oh, he tried to swerve, I'll give him that. Picture me tossed thirty feet through the air... ...only stopping when my head hit that telephone pole.
Apollo:
You hit a telephone pole with your head!? Are you OK!?
Phoenix:
Thankfully, my only injury was a sprained ankle.
Apollo:
(He really is as lucky as they say...)
About Trucy...
Apollo:
There's something that, well, it just doesn't sit right. I just can't believe you have a daughter, Mr. Wright! And... she's so big! Not fat, but, er, you know what I mean.
Phoenix:
Oh, Trucy's still a child.
Trucy:
Daddy! How many times do I have to remind you! I'm not a child anymore!
Phoenix:
Ah ha ha! But you'll always be Daddy's little baby girl to me, Trucy.
Apollo:
(Ah ha ha, my foot. I'm not buying it.)
Phoenix:
Oh, something you should know about Trucy...
Apollo:
She's a magician, right? She told me.
Phoenix:
Not a mere stage magician... She's a genius.
Trucy:
Tee hee! Aw, Daddy!
Phoenix:
You'll soon come to appreciate her "talent".
Apollo:
You could just tell me things instead of insinuating them.
Wright Talent Agency
Apollo:
So, why did you contact me? What could the Wright Talent Agency possibly want with me?
Phoenix:
No need to get prickly, now.
Apollo:
Hey, I didn't ask to be dragged in like this!
Trucy:
Huh? But didn't you come into the office of your own free will anyway?
Apollo:
Well, yeah, of course. "Help! We're in big trouble here at the office! Big!" ...I thought someone was dying.
Phoenix:
So you don't think this is big trouble? My talent agency represents only two people... and one of them is in the hospital.
Trucy:
That's right, Daddy! How are we going to pay this month's rent!? And the groceries!?
Phoenix:
Yeah... That's the problem with such a tight operation. It's a symbiotic relationship. When one of us falls, the other, too, must fall...
Apollo:
Hey! This isn't exactly a suitable conversation to be having with a 15 year old kid!
Phoenix:
In any case, if Apollo here can't help you... ...you'll have to transfer to a new school. Again.
Trucy:
No! I can't! I only just made friends... How could you do this to me... to us!? Polly!
Apollo:
Huh? What? Now it's my fault?
Phoenix:
On that note, how about you come work for us? I've got the perfect client for you already lined up.
Apollo:
A... A client? (You mean I get to do my job? I get to defend in court!?) ...Alright. I'll hear what you have to say.
Trucy:
You got him, Daddy! Hook, line, and sinker!
Phoenix:
Ah ha. Now it's time to reel him in!
Apollo:
(It's official: I'm scared.)
Our client (appears after "Wright Talent Agency")
Apollo:
Alright, so who's the client?
Phoenix:
Ah, yes. Here, take a look at the map and I'll explain. Last night, I left the office just before nine o'clock... I was going to that Indochine pasta joint, Alden Tae's. I play piano there, of course. ...That's when it happened! The car sent me flying, nicked a telephone pole... ...and zoomed away. Creepy, huh?
Apollo:
Just a tad. It's almost as creepy as hearing you tell the story like it was no big deal.
Phoenix:
The car sped off in this direction... ...So, good luck!
Apollo:
...Huh?
Phoenix:
You wanted a client, didn't you? Well, I'm your client! Find the guy who knocked me into that telephone pole!
Apollo:
Whoa, hold on! I'm a defense attorney, not a detective!
Phoenix:
Don't worry. Once you've found the guy, I intend to sue him. Then you can stick it to him in court!
Apollo:
...I'm not a prosecutor either! I'm sorry, but... this is crazy. I'm going home.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
What's that? Looks strangely familiar...
Apollo:
How could you not recognize an attorney's badge!?
Phoenix:
It's been seven years. I've forgotten... a lot of things.
Apollo:
(I guess some seven years are longer than others.)
After clearing "Our client" Talk option: 
Phoenix:
Don't get so worked up. It was just a joke.
Apollo:
Huh?
Trucy:
Oh, Daddy. Sorry, Apollo. He just loves jokes, you know. Even the ones that aren't very funny.
Phoenix:
Your real client should be stopping by the office any time now.
Apollo:
The office... You mean the talent agency? (No harm in going. It's not like I have anything else to do.)
Phoenix:
...One more thing. Do look into my accident too, would you? I marked the scene of the tragedy on this map. It's right in front of this park. Should be easy to find.
Apollo:
(So, he's going to make me investigate this after all...)
Map added to the Court Record.
Present
Map
Phoenix:
I've marked the location of the accident on your map. Find the criminal who knocked me into that telephone pole!
June 15, 10:05 AM
Wright Talent Agency
???:
Hey hey hey! How long you planning on making me wait, eh!?
Trucy:
Ah! Good morning!
???:
Hey there, Trucy-doll. Sounds like your pops had a bit of a rough spot, eh?
Trucy:
All's well that ends well, I guess...
Apollo:
(This... is our client?)
???:
Hey! So this is that Pollo fellow, eh?
Apollo:
Oh, uh, y-yes? (The name's "Apollo".)
???:
Look at 'im there, arms all crossed-like. Ready to fight!
Apollo:
Yes, sir! ...You don't mean that literally, do you?
???:
The boss told you what I need, right? Don't let me down now, Pollo!
Apollo:
Don't worry about your defense sir, I'm on it!
???:
Defense...? Your noodle half-cooked? It's too late for defense! My castle's been stormed! My keep's been kept! My noodle stand's been stolen!
Apollo:
N-Noodle...?
Trucy:
You know Mr. Eldoon from the noodle stand, don'cha, Polly?
Apollo:
No nicknames, please. And no, of course I don't know him!
???:
You new in these parts?
Apollo:
Not really...
???:
Then you know the best noodles in town: Eldoon's Noodles!
Apollo:
Uh, whose noodles?
???:
My noodles! Er, help me out here, Trucy-doll.
Trucy:
This is Mr. Guy Eldoon... our client! Maybe you can tell us what the problem is, Mr. Eldoon?
Guy:
Anything for you, Trucy-doll!
Talk
Who's this guy?
Apollo:
So... You run a noodle stand, Mr....
Guy:
Eldoon. Guy Eldoon's the name! And noodles are my game. The secret's in the soup! I've been searching for the perfect soup for a year 'n' a half.
Apollo:
Oh. That's... not that long, really.
Guy:
My family's been noodle men for generations. Got a lot of expectation on my shoulders. Fifteen fathers passing the noodle to fifteen sons.
Trucy:
That's a pretty old noodle!
Guy:
Aye, and fool that I was, I pushed it away. I rebelled against my pops, and picked another livelihood. But... that didn't turn out so well.
Apollo:
Oh.
Guy:
There was no denying it... Salty broth runs through these veins, boy!
Trucy:
So, it was like destiny that you became what you are.
Guy:
Right, destiny's the word! Oh, I fought it... ...but in the end I was bound by the twisted noodle of fate!
Apollo:
(Not a mental image I care to linger on.)
Guy:
So, last year, I started my noodle stand. The 15th generation of Eldoon's Noodles!
Eldoon's Noodles
Apollo:
Um... So tell me more about Eldoon's Noodles.
Guy:
You don't know the genius that are my noodles!? I make 'em so salty, why, they're saltier than... salt!
Apollo:
(Now I really don't want to find out.)
Trucy:
Daddy's a regular at his noodle stand.
Guy:
He frequented my pops's stand back during his attorney days, too. Yep, him and his assistant.
Apollo:
I'm sorry... I'll be sure to drop by your stand soon.
Guy:
Wish you could, sonny!
Apollo:
Eh?
Guy:
Heck, I wish I could! I'd give anything for a bowl 'bout now.
Trucy:
What do you mean?
Guy:
It was stolen! My stand! Gone!
Apollo:
Stolen...?
Stolen stand (appears after "Eldoon's Noodles")
Guy:
It was last night... I was doing my rounds, blowin' my whistle.
Trucy:
It's like an ice-cream truck's bell but louder! He even gets complaints!
Guy:
Eh heh, now you're just trying to butter me up.
Apollo:
(That sounded more like the blues than a whistle...)
Guy:
I closed up my stand for the night and parked by the house. Then, this morning, dark 'n' early... It was gone! My keep! My castle! Oooooh!
Apollo:
Maybe some bum carted it off? ...Just guessing here.
Guy:
Well, I don't care who did it! Without that stand, I'm finished! All my noodle bowls were in there, too.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Guy:
Yee haw! Attaboy! Way to flash 'em! Ol' Phoenix used to do that to my pops all the time.
Trucy:
Your father...?
Guy:
Yup, he'd whip that bad boy out 'n' say "Put it on my tab, you know I'm good for it."
Apollo:
(A tab at a noodle joint?)
Anything else
Guy:
Sorry, fellah, but the only business I'm concerned with is my business. You gotta help me out! Get my business back!
After clearing "Stolen stand" Talk option: 
Trucy:
That's the saddest thing I've heard all day.
Guy:
You know it. Anyhows, that's the deal. Good luck!
Apollo:
Good... huh? Wait... What exactly is your request?
Guy:
My noodle stand! Find it! And the day you bring my baby back is the day you feast on as many noodles as you want! Course I make it so hot 'n' salty, two bowls'd kill a man. Then I'd really need defense!
Apollo:
Speaking of defense, that's what I do. I'm a lawyer. Not a detective...
Guy:
This is where I live, you drop by if you need any info, 'kay? Get it back today if you can, Pollo! I got noodles to make!
Apollo:
Things have certainly taken a turn for the bizarre. Traffic accidents... and noodle stand thieves.
Trucy:
Um, actually... There was something I wanted to ask you about, too, Apollo.
Apollo:
Huh? (I have a bad feeling about this.)
Guy:
Ah, listen to the lady's problem now. Don't be cruel!
Trucy:
I lost something last night. That is, something was stolen.
Guy:
Hey, what's this? More thieving and skullduggery!?
Trucy:
Well, um... Someone stole a pair of my panties.
Apollo:
...Panties?
Talk
Trucy's request
Leads to:
"Erm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er..."
Apollo:
Erm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er...
Trucy:
My panties, yes.
Apollo:
Ah, er, right. Panties.
Guy:
That's a cryin' shame, that is, Trucy-doll.
Trucy:
I was alone in the office last night. I had hung my panties out the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. "Give those back!" I shouted. "Wait!"
Apollo:
Well, that was certainly brave of you.
Trucy:
...But I lost him. Without those panties, I don't know what I'll do...
Guy:
A darn cryin' shame, yup.
Trucy:
Well, at least the scene of the crime is convenient. I'll mark it on your map!
Guy:
I'll be headin' home now. Remember, find my stand or there's an empty bowl in yer future, Pollo!
Apollo:
Er, right.
Guy:
And you help out Trucy-doll here, too, y'hear?
Trucy:
Things have certainly picked up, haven't they! We had no work yesterday, and now we have three cases!
Apollo:
I... I guess.
Trucy:
Let's see where we stand!
Apollo:
(Not in a courtroom, that's where.) Well, the first item on our list...
Trucy:
Phoenix Wright... Daddy's hit and run accident. We have to find the one who hit him!
Apollo:
...Who's going to pay us for this again?
Trucy:
And the second item... Mr. Eldoon's request.. to find his stolen stand.
Apollo:
For which we stand to gain... a bowl of salty noodles...
Trucy:
And the last request is mine! To find my stolen panties!
Apollo:
...That bowl of noodles is looking better and better.
Trucy:
Let's go, Polly! To the streets!
Apollo:
Aren't you enthusiastic.
Trucy:
How could I not be!? Let's crack these cases, you and me!
Apollo:
(*sigh* Guess we might as well get started... Let's see. A hit and run... a stolen stand... And last but not least... stolen panties.)

Panty-snatcher
Apollo:
(Maybe I should ask her more about her... uh... This is going to be difficult--)
Trucy:
Apollo!
Apollo:
Yeah?
Trucy:
Your [sic] going to have to press me for information! Go ahead, do your worst!
Apollo:
Uh, no thanks, I pass.
Trucy:
You can't "pass"! This is your job! Look, I had hung them outside the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. "Give those back!" I shouted. "Wait!" ...But I lost him. I can't live without those panties! Please find them!
Any leads?
Apollo:
Well? Do we have any leads?
Trucy:
Hmm... One moment... ... Allakazam! Allakazing!
Apollo:
(Whoa! Where'd all this evidence come from?)
Trucy:
...
Apollo:
Um... So what happens next?
Trucy:
That's it! Pretty neat, huh?
Apollo:
...Yeah. Neat. (*sigh*)
Present
Anything
Trucy:
What's that, Polly? Oh, I know! You want to see a magic trick! Well, you've come to the right girl! Watch as I make that evidence disappear, forever!
Apollo:
Whoa! No, don't! Sorry, my bad!
June 15
Hickfield Clinic
Apollo:
Huh? Mr. Wright's gone.
Trucy:
Maybe he's gone for an examination?
Apollo:
He'll probably be back soon. Let's wait.
Trucy:
I think it might take some time. Daddy always loves his examinations!
Apollo:
(Don't ask, Justice. You don't want to know.)
Trucy:
Why don't we come back later?
Apollo:
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Examine
Bottle
Apollo:
A bottle of Mr. Wright's favorite brand of grape juice. After that trial, I'll never drink grape juice again. Clearly not a problem for Mr. Wright, however.
DVD stack
Apollo:
A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. It looks ready to collapse. Better keep my distance.
Hospital bed
Apollo:
Mr. Wright's bed. Wow, what a mess. Trucy must be in charge of cleaning at home.
Piano
Apollo:
A small, children's piano. I guess the man likes pink.
Television
Apollo:
The television's been left on... to an episode of the Steel Samurai. That's the same episode as before. Must be his favorite.
June 15Accident Scene
Apollo:
So this is where Mr. Wright got hit by that car?
Trucy:
According to the map, this is the place!
Apollo:
What a huge mansion... Feels like Chinatown.
Trucy:
Apollo! There's a nice-looking lady over there. Let's question her!
Apollo:
Um, OK. (I'm a little curious about the park over there, too...)
Trucy:
Excuse me! Um, can we have a few words with you?
???:
You want something?
Apollo:
(Whoa! That husky voice... Why am I suddenly sweating?)
Trucy:
That's quite a house you've got there! You must have a lot of money...
???:
Whoooh. "Money" sounds like something my son would call his friends. This is the Kitaki Family mansion, little girl.
Apollo:
Eh.
???:
You, kid with the hair. You want something?
Apollo:
Urk! M-M-Me? No, not a thing! Bye!
Trucy:
Apollo! We can't leave without questioning her! What if she knows something!
Apollo:
B-But th-the Kitaki Family...! (They're the biggest organized crime syndicate in town!)
???:
If you're going to ask something, ask it. If you're man enough.
Apollo:
Waaaaugh! R-Right!
Trucy:
Yay! Way to whip him into shape, ma'am!
Apollo:
(Does she know no fear!?)
Plum:
I'm Plum. Plum Kitaki. Wife of the fourth head of the Kitaki Family business. Friends call me Little Plum.
Apollo:
I-I'm l-little Apollo Justice, attorney at law. *gulp* (If looks could kill, this woman would be a mass-murderer by now...)
Examine (left side)
Mansion front gate
Trucy:
Wow, what a big house! And the gate is so big...
Apollo:
The Kitaki Family is pretty big around these parts.
Trucy:
I like the fox! It's so cute!
Plum:
Ah, that. That's our family crest... from the old country.
Trucy:
Your family "crest"?
Plum:
We're clever as the fox... and our teeth are sharp.
Trucy:
So it's like a motto! You need a crest, too, Apollo! Ooh! How about the scales of justice? Or a lunar lander!
Apollo:
(...I'll pass, thanks.)
Mansion gate wall
Apollo:
A brightly painted dragon. Why do I get the feeling he's glaring at me? Those paints must have been to repaint this wall.
Plum:
That's right. I called in an artist to do the job right. ...He's the third so far.
Apollo:
The... third?
Plum:
The first spilled paint all over the entrance here, the second on my kimono... So I...
Apollo:
N-No, don't tell me. It's better that I don't know.
Spilled paint
Apollo:
There's paint splashed all over this gate. (What a mess...)
Trucy:
Was this paint knocked over by the car that hit my Daddy?
Plum:
That's right. Feh. And I'm left to clean up the mess. If you find whoever did this, bring the scoundrel by, would you?
Trucy:
Of course! Then you can make them clean up their own mess!
Plum:
Ah ha ha ha! You're cute. Naïve, but cute. When I find whoever did this, you can bet I'll be doing some "cleaning". There's nothing I dislike so much... as a mess.
Trucy:
Ooh! I wish I could say cool things like that!
Plum:
I'll bet you do! Wa ha ha ha ha!!!
Apollo:
(I'd laugh if my teeth weren't chattering so hard.)
Talk
The Kitakis
Trucy:
Little Plum? That's a really cute name for someone so...
Plum:
Yes...?
Apollo:
Wh-Whoa!
Trucy:
What is it, Apollo?
Apollo:
How about you go through me when talking to her, OK, Trucy?
Trucy:
Huh? That seems like a bit of a needless procedure.
Apollo:
I'm a lawyer. I live for needless procedures.
Plum:
Oh little girl, you should know... We're gangsters.
Trucy:
Gangst... Oh! That means you're the bad guys!
Apollo:
Trucy! Through me! Please! I'm begging you here!
Plum:
Wa ha ha ha ha!!! The bad guys... I like the sound of that!
Apollo:
(...I'm going to need some warm tea after this.)
Plum:
It takes a lot of hard work to protect a family fortune. Things aren't as easy as they used to be for us "bad guys".
Trucy:
So, you're saying that business is in a slump?
Apollo:
(Let's not ask about "business if we can help it, please?)
Last night's accident
Apollo:
There was a car accident here last night?
Plum:
Last night...
Apollo:
Of c-course you wouldn't know about it! S-Sorry to bother you!
Plum:
Wait.
Apollo:
Y-Yes?
Plum:
You're talking about that man, aren't you? The one who flew thirty feet and just walked away?
Trucy:
That's my daddy!
Plum:
Ah ha ha! I should've known! One of our Capos thought he'd make a great point man...
Trucy:
Capo? Point man...?
Apollo:
Um, could you avoid using too much, er, industry lingo?
Plum:
In any case, it's been nothing but trouble. I've been cleaning up this mess since morning! Bah!
Apollo:
Cleaning up this... paint?
Splattered paint (appears after "Last night's accident")
Apollo:
Was this paint spilled at the time of the accident?
Plum:
It was around 9 last night. I heard a crashing noise... ...and found your father drowning in a sea of paint.
Trucy:
So you came to his rescue?
Plum:
You've my husband... the Boss to thank for that. The car that hit your father knocked over this paint... ...then turned the corner, and sped away. We're in the middle of repainting our wall, you see.
Apollo:
(I'm sure that dragon is glaring at me.)
Trucy:
But, why are you out here cleaning it up?
Plum:
What do you mean?
Trucy:
I mean, aren't you a gangster? Don't you have any "goons" to do your dirty work for you?
Apollo:
Please! Go through me when you want to...
Plum:
Wa ha ha ha ha!!! Don't be such a stiff, lawyer-boy. I suppose we gangsters do have a certain image...
Apollo:
Urm, yes.
Plum:
But we're community-oriented gangsters, you see. ...The Boss likes to give back to the people, see?
Apollo:
(How noble of him...)
Plum:
I availed myself of the public facilities to get rid of all the garbage... Now there's just the paint on the street to deal with.
Apollo:
(Public facilities...? I wonder if she means that trash can...)
Present
Anything
Plum:
Sorry, kid. I got no idea what you're talking about.
After switching to right side view:
Apollo:
Who's that!? She's looking at the park.
Trucy:
She's pretty. I bet she has a story, you know?
Apollo:
(There is something about her... Too bad she seems to be in a bit of a rush.)
Examine (right side)
Old Lady
Apollo:
...Looks like there's some trouble by the park gate.
Trucy:
I smell an incident!
Officer:
Ma'am! There's no entry to the park!
Old Lady:
Now don't you tell me where I can't go, young fella! I always walk through this park on my way home!
Officer:
Please, get down from there! You'll hurt yourself, ma'am!
Apollo:
(That's quite the determined old lady.)
People Park sign
Apollo:
People Park... Huh, kind of an odd name for such an empty place.
Trucy:
I wonder why it's named that? Hey! There's something written on the gate post...
Apollo:
Huh? Oh yeah... It says, "Donated by Big Wins Kitaki".
Trucy:
You mean the Kitaki Family built this park? It's so nice of them to give to the community like that!
Apollo:
...Let's not get too friendly with them, shall we? (A gangster building a park...? Odd move for a crime boss.)
Police officer (after examining old lady)
Apollo:
Personally, I'm a little more interested in this park.
Trucy:
You know what I think? I bet they're filming a movie. Let's go take a look! Maybe we'll see someone famous!
Officer:
Hey, Miss! Stay out of the park!
Trucy:
...He got mad at me.
Apollo:
Um, did something happen here, officer?
Officer:
Huh? Uh, no, move along, nothing to see. Why don't you kids go play someplace else?
Apollo:
We're not kids and we're not playing! I'm an attorney!
???:
...Something wrong?
Officer:
Ah, Detective Skye! We're fine ma'am, nothing to report!
Apollo:
(Detective...?)
Trucy:
Why's she wearing a lab coat?
Apollo:
You're hardly one to comment on how people are dressed.
???:
And... these kids are?
Officer:
Curiosity seekers, ma'am. They claim to be "lawyers".
???:
Ah. Why don't you kids run along and play someplace else?
Apollo:
Look, we're not...
???:
Or I might spill something on that pretty face of yours. Want a dose of experimental Hydroxyacelunodosetrase?
Trucy:
...Come again? What's Hydroxy... stuff?
Apollo:
Whatever it is, it doesn't sound good. Let's go, Trucy!
???:
Try to keep out the riff-raff, if you would.
Officer:
Yes ma'am!
Apollo:
Grr... How are we going to get more information like this?
Trucy:
Why don't we ask that nice woman across the street?
Apollo:
(Oh yes, that nice woman... *gulp*)
Police officer (subsequent times)
Apollo:
I gotta say, I'd really like to know what happened here...
Officer:
Hey, I said no one goes in! Unless you want a face-full of hydroxyadayadawhatzit!
Apollo:
(Hmm... No dice.)
Trash can
Apollo:
There's a big trash can on the way into the park. I guess we could check it out...
Trucy:
A detective's life sure is a hard one!
Apollo:
I'm an attorney, actua... Huh?
Trucy:
Hmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them.
Apollo:
These... are slippers. They look like those slippers you get at the hospital...
Trucy:
Look at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...?
Apollo:
It's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone.
Trucy:
Wait, you don't think...
Apollo:
I do. This could be from the car that hit Mr. Wright!
Trucy:
Wow, and he took off its mirror? I never knew Daddy was so strong. I only have room in my pocket for one of these, though. Which do you want to take?
Slippers
Slippers crammed into pocket.
Mirror
Mirror slipped into pocket.
Trash can (subsequent times, if Slippers was chosen)
Apollo:
There's a side-view mirror with some paint on it in this trash can.
Trucy:
I can only carry one thing at a time in my pocket, you know.
Apollo:
(Should I swap the slippers for the mirror?)
Swap
Apollo:
Sure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would.
Trucy:
I'm on it!
Mirror slipped into pocket.
No need
Apollo:
...On second thought, let's not and say we did.
Trash can (subsequent times, if Mirror was chosen)
Apollo:

Apollo:
Sure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would.
Trucy:
Right-o!
Slippers crammed into pocket.
No need
Apollo:
Actually... let's not and say we did.
Talk
People Park (appears after examining police officer)
Apollo:
...Can I ask you a question?
Plum:
What?
Apollo:
...What happened in the park across the street?
Plum:
Oh, yes, quite the commotion. "Chicago Lightning", as the Boss would say.
Trucy:
Chicago... huh?
Plum:
Gunfire. Someone was killed. Strange circumstances, too.
Apollo:
You're kidding!
Plum:
What a morning! Trouble everywhere. The park, the gate, even our house...
Trucy:
Did something happen at your house, too?
Plum:
A crime without honor! Without remorse! It's a private matter... Wanna hear about it?
Trucy:
Somehow I don't think "no" is an acceptable answer, Polly.
A private matter (appears after "People Park")
Apollo:
So... what happened at your house?
Plum:
Bloomers. Last night.
Apollo:
Eh. (I got a bad feeling about this...)
Plum:
Me, Little Plum Kitaki, the victim of a panty-snatcher!
Trucy:
Whaaaaaaat? So it wasn't just my panties that were stolen!?
Plum:
Got you too, did they? Poor thing. Like I said, whoever did this is a hardened criminal. It wasn't you, was it!?
Apollo:
N-No! Of course not! Mercy!
Plum:
I've heard word that panties have been disappearing lately. ...And the missing panties all have something in common.
Apollo:
(It's hard to imagine Trucy's and Mrs. Kitaki's panties having much in common... I just imagined Mrs. Kitaki's panties... *gulp*)
Trucy:
I know! We'll find your bloomers, too!
Plum:
Great! Show me what you're made of.
Apollo:
(What have you gotten me into this time, Trucy?)
Present
Mirror
Apollo:
Can you tell me anything about this mirror?
Plum:
That's probably from the car that knocked that fellow across the street.
Apollo:
(Right! That makes this a valuable clue!)
Plum:
Let me know if you find that car, would you? You splash Kitaki paint, you pay the price.
Examine evidence
Slippers
Toe print
Apollo:
Huh? This spot here is black.
Trucy:
I wonder what that is...? It doesn't look like paint...
Paint on bottom
Trucy:
The bottom is covered with paint!
Apollo:
Huh? What's this weird shape here?
Trucy:
It looks like a leaf was stuck to the bottom when the wearer stepped in some yellow paint.
Apollo:
So the outline was left when the leaf was removed! Ack! I got paint on my hand!
Trucy:
...... Apollo! I saw you try to wipe your hand on my cape!
Mirror
Bare wires
Trucy:
It's cut clean off! I wonder what's in there...?
Apollo:
Don't. There are bare wires hanging out.
Trucy:
Let's see... Zzzzzzaaaaap! Eeek!
Apollo:
Wha--!? A-Are you OK!?
Trucy:
Hee hee! Just a little joke!
Apollo:
...... Don't scare me like that!
Trucy:
You mean, don't "shock" you? Zzzzzzaaaaap! Hee hee!
After clearing all Talk options:
???:

Apollo:

Plum:
Oh! Welcome home, sweetie.
???:
Ah, uh... hello, m-mother.

Trucy:
Uh, um, Miss! Miss!
???:
...?
Trucy:
Here, our flyer.
???:
The... Wright Anything Agency?
Apollo:
A-Anything Agency?
Trucy:
Yeah! Do you like the new flyer? So, um, this is our defense attorney, Mr. Apollo Justice!
???:
Attorney...?
Trucy:
Drop by our office! We'll be waiting!
???:
Ah... Good-bye.
Apollo:
Why did you give her our flyer?
Trucy:
I dunno. She seemed like she could use some help.
Apollo:
She's the heiress to a gangster dynasty! She doesn't need our help!
Trucy:
...I wouldn't be so sure!
Apollo:
...?
June 15
Scene of the Stand Theft
Apollo:
So... what's this place?
Trucy:
This would be Mr. Eldoon's house, silly.
Apollo:
Oh, so this is where his stand was stolen from. I can see a piece of evidence lying on the ground already.
Trucy:
...Hey! Look, there's a police car parked over there.
Apollo:
You're right... What's with the sparkly... entrance? What is this place? A hospital? There's a sign... "Meraktis Clinic".
Trucy:
Hmm... Oh! That's where the thief went!
Apollo:
The thief...?
Trucy:
The one who snatched my panties! He ran into this clinic last night! Wait, maybe that police car is here to find my panties!
Apollo:
I doubt it.
Trucy:
Well, there's only one way to be sure! Let's investigate!
Guy:
Ah, there you are, sonny! Well, you find anything yet!?
Apollo:
Er, um, no. Not yet.
Guy:
The longer you loaf around here the saltier your victory bowl gets, just remember that!
Apollo:
(This bowl of noodles is sounding less like payment and more like punishment...)
Examine
Clinic front door
Trucy:
That doorway sure is sparkly!
Apollo:
The "Meraktis Clinic", huh. Looks more like a casino parlor than a hospital. They must be quite profitable.
Trucy:
Funny, it looks closed. Maybe they're on vacation today?
Green banner
Apollo:
Looks like they have a special offer going on...
Trucy:
"Three shots for the price of one!" Ooh, now's our chance, Apollo!
Apollo:
Chance for what!? I don't need any shots, thank you. Whoever runs this clinic, they seem pretty business-minded.
Police car
Apollo:
I'd understand if there was an ambulance outside... But a police car?
Trucy:
Maybe they're tax evaders!
Officer:
Ah, sorry miss. No going into the clinic today.
Trucy:
Did something happen?
Officer:
Huh? Oh, no. Nothing to see here. Move along. You'll have to find someplace else to play doctor.
Apollo:
(Do we look like the right age to be playing doctor!?) We need a little more info on this Meraktis Clinic.
Trucy:
We could ask Mr. Eldoon. He is their neighbor and all. And we should check out that garage! What if the thief who stole my panties is still in there!?
Apollo:
...*sigh*
Blue tarp
Guy:
That's the place! Right there! That's where I kept my stand. Covered all nice 'n' purty with that blue tarp there!
Apollo:
So you used this plastic sheet to cover your stand at night? ...I see.
Trucy:
You see? What? Did you figure out why it was stolen!?
Apollo:
Well no, but it does suggest that the thief knew what he or she was looking for. They clearly knew what was under that sheet.
Guy:
So it wasn't one of those casual drive-by stand snatchers, you mean? Not bad, sonny-boy. Not bad at all!
Bowl
Apollo:
Is this yours, Mr. Eldoon?
Guy:
Hey! That there's the heart and soul of Eldoon's Noodles! The bowl absorbs my salty soup... Pretty soon it's gonna taste just like noodles!
Trucy:
Wow! It does smell like noodles!
Guy:
All my other bowls got taken away with my stand! Get it back for me, sonny-boy, I'm beggin' ya!
Bowl added to the Court Record.
House
Trucy:
This house is... well, it's old!
Guy:
It's been well-loved, that's for sure. I've lived here with my wife for many years now. It's got character, though, just like my soup!
Apollo:
(I always thought character was a positive thing.)
"NOO" sign
Apollo:
...That's quite a sign. I take it that's "NOO" as opposed to "OLD"?
Guy:
Ah, you like it? Made it myself, I did. I meant to write "Noodles" but ran outta space.
Trucy:
Prior planning prevents poor performance!
Guy:
Lucky for me it spells a word all by itself! And spruces up my image, it does!
Apollo:
(It does have a certain power of willful denial thing going for it.)
Oil drum
Apollo:
It looks like the oil drum is connected to that sink over there...
Trucy:
Collecting rainwater to do the dishes! How environmentally conscious!
Apollo:
You... don't think he uses rainwater to cook his noodles and to make the broth, do you?
Trucy:
Oh I'm sure he finds the best water money can buy! Taste is his business, you know. Look, that sign over there! "Eldoon's only uses water from all-natural sources!"
Apollo:
... (I think I'll take a rain check on eating here.)
Sign under oil drum
Apollo:
There's a hand-written sign here... "Save the light!"
Trucy:
"Save the light!" indeed! Mr. Eldoon's house is practically in the dark here!
Apollo:
I guess the hospital clinic next door blocks the sunlight.
Guy:
Everything's gone wrong since they built this monstrosity! Broth needs sun or it rots! What's a man to do? They just want my customers to get food poisoning so they can turn a pretty profit...
Apollo:
(That seems like a lot of trouble to go through for a few extra patients...)
Spoon the dog
Trucy:
Look! A doggy! Good boy, good boy, Salty!
Apollo:
I'm sure the dog has a real name, Trucy.
Guy:
Yup, sure does! Name's Spoon. And it's a she, by the way.
Trucy:
Spoon doesn't seem so lively.
Guy:
She didn't get her bowl of salty broth this mornin', that's why. Poor lil' thing. *sniff*
Trucy:
Apollo! Let's find that stand soon! For Spoon's sake!
Apollo:
(I'm pretty sure dogs aren't supposed to eat noodles...)
Talk
Eldoon's Noodles
Apollo:
So, your stand... "Eldoon's Noodles", was it?
Guy:
Aye! Passed down from father to son. That stand's seen its share o' salt, mmm-hmm. Salt runs in the family, you might say.
Apollo:
(I bet high blood pressure does too.) So... your stand, Eldoon's Noodles, was stolen...
Guy:
Oh, it wasn't just the stand that was stolen, sonny-boy! I lost those wobbly wheels, my salt-crusted stewpot, my stained sign... I didn't just lose a stand, I lost a legend!
Trucy:
No one steals a legend and gets away with it on my watch! Let's find that legend, Apollo!
Apollo:
(Isn't it about time he bought a new one anyway?)
Stolen stand
Apollo:
Are there any more details you could give me about the stand?
Guy:
You bet, sonny-boy! It happened last night... I was blowing my whistle like always, crying the town, I was. The smell of broth filled the streets... thick 'n' salty. I got home, well, right before 10 PM, I reckon.
Apollo:
(Guess he's not aiming for that late-night market.)
Guy:
I washed my bowls and gave the wheels a squirt of grease. Then I went inside.
Apollo:
When did you notice it had been stolen?
Guy:
Early this morning. Before the sun rose. Work starts early!
Apollo:
(Do that many people eat noodles for breakfast!?)
Guy:
I'm washed up on the salty shores of ruination! That stand had my whole life in it... nay, my whole being!
Trucy:
They took everything?
Guy:
All my soup stock, my noodles, my bowls... and my dreams!
Trucy:
At least they left one bowl. Look, there, on the ground.
Guy:
If you don't find that stand today... Then I'll be forced to walk the streets, peddling that bowl... my last bowl.
Apollo:
Please, I'm under enough pressure here as it is.
The garage
Trucy:
That's it! That's where the thief who snatched my panties ran to!
Guy:
It's a crying shame, that is. If they have to steal, make it my loincloth! Not some pretty girl's panties!
Apollo:
The garage, right. You don't think the thief lives here, do you?
Guy:
Feh! I wouldn't put it past that good-for-nothing doctor!
Apollo:
(Hmm... Do I detect a little animosity here?)
Trucy:
Let's make sure to check out that garage thoroughly!
Meraktis Clinic (appears after examining police car)
Trucy:
Hey, do you think something happened next door? There's a police car out front...
Guy:
Feh! Probably gave someone food poisoning, I'll bet!
Apollo:
(If anyone's at risk of giving someone food poisoning...)
Guy:
That police car got here this mornin', actually. I asked what they were up to, but they wouldn't even tell me, the neighbor! Feh!
Trucy:
Hmm...
Guy:
Not that I was surprised much. That doctor works for the wrong crowd. It was just a matter of time 'fore he got what was coming to him. Feh!
Apollo:
The "wrong crowd"...?
Guy:
...Never you mind about that.
Present
Bowl
Guy:
You can tell my bowls by the Mr. Salty logo!
Trucy:
The mascot of Eldoon's Noodles!
Guy:
They come to the stand, they sit, they drink deep from that bowl... ...and when they see the  bottom, their face looks jus' like Mr. Salty's! Genius, no!?
Trucy:
Very high-concept.
Guy:
You can't ply a trade if you don't love the tools. Remember that!
Trucy:
Yes sir!
Apollo:
(Trucy has a thing for professionals, clearly.)
Anything else
Guy:
Sorry, sonny-boy. My interest is for my stand and precious little else. Get cracking on that case! Find my stand, I'm beggin' ya!
Examine evidence
Bowl
Inside of bowl
Trucy:
It's the Eldoon's Noodle's mascot! Mr. Salty! He's so cute!
Apollo:
It's not a very endearing mascot, is it?
Trucy:
You know... Come to think of it... ...It looks a lot like you, Apollo. Especially the red parts.
Apollo:
Can I help if I like red?
Bottom of bowl
Trucy:
Ooh, look! I love these little personal touches!
Apollo:
Seems a shame to hide it on the bottom of the bowl. ...Huh? When I touched it the paint flaked off.
Trucy:
He must have painted it on by hand with warm, professional care!
Apollo:
After buying the cheapest paint he could find with cold professional thrift.
June 15Meraktis ClinicGarage
Trucy:
This is the place! This is where that panty-snatcher ran!
Apollo:
Are you sure?
Trucy:
Maybe! Let's look for clues! Clues... to a panty-snatching! Clues... like a pair of panties!
Apollo:
...Um, Trucy? Could you try not saying "panties" so many times?

Car
Apollo:
There's something about this car...
Trucy:
Let's take a closer look!
Cell Phone
Apollo:
Look... a cell phone.
Trucy:
Someone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure!
Apollo:
Hmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here?
Trucy:
We should bring it to him later!
Cell Phone added to the Court Record.
Mirror
Trucy:
Hey! Look at that!
Apollo:
The mirror's been broken off! (Now THIS is a clue!)

Oh, I wasn't smiling. It was the dust in here. I thought I was going to sneeze... Ah... ah... ah... WAACHOOO!
Trucy:
Well, don't make faces that ah... AH-CHOO! ...are so misleading then.
Apollo:
(I know yawns are contagious, but sneezes...?)

... That's your clue? Sorry, but that leaves me feeling kind of... clueless.
Apollo:
(Like father like daughter with the humor, apparently.)
Trucy:
There's no need to bluff here, Apollo! Save that for the court!
Apollo:
(Thanks for the advice...)
Apollo:
My clue is... this!
Trucy:
Whoa! It's the same color and size and everything! A perfect match!
Apollo:
I guess we could check it out...
Trucy:
Hmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them. Look at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...?
Apollo:
It's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone.
Apollo:
Well... looks like we've just solved a case.
Trucy:
So the car that hit Daddy last night...
Apollo:
...Is sitting right in front of us, yep.
Trucy:
Wow. You put the "pro" in "professional", Apollo!
Apollo:
Gee, thanks, Trucy.
Tailpipe
Apollo:
That reminds me... I once read a record of a case that Mr. Wright worked on many years ago.
Trucy:
...?
Apollo:
Apparently, there was this car with a piece of cloth shoved into the tailpipe! That piece of cloth turned out to be a vital clue to solving the case!
Trucy:
Wow!
Apollo:
I remember that case record whenever I'm checking out a car... And I always check the tailpipe!
Trucy:
Everyone's gotta have a hobby, I guess.
Apollo:
Wouldn't it be funny if... ...Hey! There's something in here!
Trucy:
What!?
Apollo:
W-Wait a second... Are these your...
Trucy:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! My panties!!!
Apollo:
Whaaaat!? Already!?
Trucy:
Wow, thank you, Apollo! You're a genius! Amazing!
Apollo:
No, no, really, don't mention it.
Trucy:
No, I'm serious, I'm really impressed! You must have a nose for finding girls' panties!
Apollo:
... Um, what are those?
Trucy:
My little panties, of course! They've come home to mama! I can't wait to use them!
Apollo:
Y-You're going to put them on? N-Now!?
Trucy:
Watch closely now... See? Nothing in the panties... ...Ta-da!!!
Apollo:
Whoa! Wh-Where'd that come from!?
Apollo:
How did that bowl get in your panties!?
Trucy:
My panties are an extra-dimensional space... Anything can fit in there! ...They're my Magic Panties! It's one of my best tricks.
Apollo:
Magic... panties?
Trucy:
They love them over at the Wonder Bar. I do shows there nightly.
Apollo:
...You mean those panties are a prop!? You could have told me a little sooner!
Trucy's Panties put discreetly away in Trucy's pocket.
Apollo:
Well, that's once case closed, at least.
Trucy:
What are you saying!? We still have to catch the sly devil that ran off with the tool of my trade!
Apollo:
Oh, right.
Before examining cell phone and mirror
Apollo:
(Something tells me we're not finished searching this garage, anyway...)
Mirror (subsequent times)
Apollo:
This mirror fits this car door perfectly...
Trucy:
So the car that hit Daddy last night...
Apollo:
...Is sitting right in front of us, yep.
Trucy:
Wow. You put the "pro" in "professional", Apollo!
Tailpipe (subsequent times)
Apollo:
Still, I'm glad. If I hadn't picked up that habit of looking up tailpipes... ...I might never have seen your panties. I mean, found your panties. Magic panties.
Trucy:
I know, it was amazing how you slyly peeked up there! I think you have a successful career in peeking up tailpipes ahead of you!
Apollo:
(I'm so glad all of this makes sense in context.)
Trucy:
You gotta wonder why my panties were here, though.
Apollo:
That is a mystery...
Before examining cell phone and mirror
Apollo:
(Something tells me we're not finished searching this garage, anyway...)
Car (after examining cell phone, tailpipe, and mirror)
Apollo:
This car belongs to someone at the Meraktis Clinic... and it hit Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright sprained his ankle, and the car lost a side-view mirror. This car vs. Mr. Wright... Not quite the match of the century.
Cat
Trucy:
Hey! A kitty-cat! Here, kitty kitty kitty.
Meow.
Trucy:
...It's not coming down.
Apollo:
We do look kind of suspicious, you have to admit.
Trucy:
It's OK kitty-cat! His hair won't hurt you!
Apollo:
It's OK kitty-cat! She won't make you disappear in her hat!
(Step)ladder
Apollo:
Look, it's a folding ladder.
Trucy:
Polly! That's called a "stepladder"! C'mon!
Apollo:
...A stepladder? How is that different from a regular ladder then?
Trucy:
It's a much more complex piece of machinery. It's like two ladders stuck together!
Apollo:
...So you admit that basically it's a ladder, right?
Trucy:
Wait... Huh?
Apollo:
You have to look past the  form... at the essence of the thing.
Trucy:
Er... Can we talk about something else?
Skeleton
Trucy:
Eeeeeeek! Someone's there! ... Oh, it's just a gold-painted human skeleton.
Apollo:
(Just a human skeleton!? ...And painted gold?)
Trucy:
There's a mannequin hand waving to us from the box behind the skeleton. This place just screams "hospital storage", don't you think?
Apollo:
It screams something, that's for sure.
Examine evidence
Cell Phone
Strap
Trucy:
Look at this cute little watch-strap! I want one!
Apollo:
...It's kind of odd, though.
Trucy:
What is?
Apollo:
I mean, if you wanted to know the time, you could just look at the phone itself.
Trucy:
Hey, you're right! Sharp, Apollo!
Apollo:
Th-Thanks. (Finally, some respect!)
Trucy:
So, what does that tell you?
Apollo:
Well, the owner of this phone doesn't think through the details, for one.
Trucy:
They did drop their phone, after all. I kinda figured they were a little spacey already.
Apollo:
Oh... good point.
Trucy's Panties
Ribbon
Apollo:
......
Trucy:
Something the matter?
Apollo:
Uh... I was just wondering if there was, like, a switch on these...
Trucy:
Of course not!
Apollo:
...Huh. Mysterious.
Trucy:
Oh? Do you want to know the secret of my panties?
Apollo:
Ack! N-No! No thanks! (Who uses magic panties in a stage show anyway...?)
After examining cell phone, tailpipe, and mirror:
Trucy:
Apollo!
Apollo:
Huh? What is it?
Trucy:
Now that we've solved this case, we should go report to Daddy! He'll mope if we leave him alone too long, knowing him.
Apollo:
Um, OK. ...He doesn't seem the type to mope, though. (And this is hardly a case worth reporting...)

Panty-snatcher (after getting Trucy's Panties)
Trucy:
What, you want to see them again? Well, if you must...
Apollo:
No no no, I'm fine, really. Let's just put them away, shall we? Case closed.
Trucy:
What are you talking about!? The case isn't closed until we have our thief! Just find him on the side while you work on the other cases!
Apollo:
If it were that easy we wouldn't need the police.
Trucy:
If we don't need the police... then we don't need defense attorneys, either, right?
Apollo:
(Fine, fine. I'll look for your panty-snatcher...)
Present
Trucy's Panties
Trucy:
I'm so glad we found my panties!
Apollo:
I had no idea they were so important to you.
Trucy:
And in time for tonight's show, too! A lot of people come just to see my panties, you know!
Apollo:
You... might not want to advertise it like that.
Trucy:

Kitaki Mansion
Examine
Trash can (after updating Mirror)
Apollo:
There's a big waste basket by the park entrance.
Trucy:
...? You aren't going to search through the trash?
Apollo:
I don't think we need to.
Trucy:
Oh, no, please, knock yourself out. Don't mind me, I'll be waiting over here.
Apollo:
Just so we're clear, searching through trash isn't a hobby of mine, OK?
Present
Mirror (after updating Mirror)
Apollo:
I found out who this mirror belongs to.
Plum:
Ooh. You're tougher than you look. Spit it out. Who was it? Where do they live?
Apollo:
Urk! I j-just forgot! Heh!
Trucy:
I remember, Apollo! It was the Meraktis Clinic!
Apollo:
Shhhh!
Trucy:
Why? I'm right, aren't I?
Plum:
...Meraktis, eh?
Apollo:
Um, yes. (Why's she so quiet all of a sudden?) ... Is something wrong?
Plum:
Erm, no. Pay me no mind. And thanks for the info.

Phoenix:
Yo! How goes it?
Trucy:
Daddy! How do you feel?
Phoenix:
Not bad, Trucy, not bad. It's good to have you young'uns on the case. Lets ol' Daddy-o get some well-deserved R&amp;R.
Trucy:
The elderly need their rest!
Apollo:
(Uh... isn't he only 33?) ...Um, we've cleared up most of the cases...
Phoenix:
I was right about you. Competent. Capable. Tell me what you found out. If you want to.
Apollo:
(Your enthusiasm is over-whelming...)
Present
Mirror
Phoenix:
So this was the thing that led you to the car.
Apollo:
Yes, sir! The mirror you knocked off was just the clue we needed!
Phoenix:
Good work, Apollo. Of course you might say... ...I was the one who made solving that case possible.
Apollo:
(...You don't get points for knocking off a car mirror.)
Trucy's Panties
Trucy:
Look! My panties! They came home to mama!
Phoenix:
Thanks, Apollo. I was worried about them, too. Trucy special ordered those...
Apollo:
(A startling display of parental concern!)
Phoenix:
I'd hate to have to buy a  new pair... *shudder*
Apollo:
(Make that a not-so-startling display of cheapskatedness.)
Anything else
Phoenix:

Apollo:

Kitaki Mansion
Trucy:
Little Plum's not here. She's not finished cleaning, huh.
Apollo:
Maybe she went to get a paint scraper?
Plum:
OK! Who's the wise guy who spit gum out on the street!?
Apollo:
(Her voice carries all the way out to the street from inside the mansion...)
Trucy:
She's a neat freak! How cute!
Plum:
You there! It was you, wasn't it!? Fess up! I hope you've said your prayers. You're gonna need them...
Apollo:
Tr-Trucy? Let's leave. Now.
Trucy:
...?
Examine
Mansion front gate
Apollo:
An impressive gate befitting the Kitaki Mansion.
Trucy:
Look at the name plate! "Kitaki"...! That's so cool! Short and blunt, like any good gangster! Ooh! Let's change our name! How about... "W. A. A."! ... Maybe that's too short and blunt. What do you think?
Apollo:
No comment.
Mansion gate wall
Apollo:
A colorful dragon turns its baleful gaze in my direction. As if to say, "Abandon all hope ye who enter here." Don't worry, Mr. Dragon. Me and hope haven't been on speaking terms for a while.
Spilled paint
Apollo:
Several colors of paint have been splashed across the gate. It's almost all dry. This is going to be tough to clean.
Old Lady
Apollo:
It looks like that woman's still causing trouble...
Officer:
Look, no one goes in! That means you!
Old Lady:
Oh, what's the difference? Let... me... go! Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow ow!!!
Officer:
Ah! S-Sorry!
Old Lady:
That's it, I'm suing! ...But I might change my mind for five bucks...
Apollo:
(What is she, some kind of con artist?)
People Park sign
Apollo:
Apparently, this park was the gift of the Kitaki Family. The friendly "People Park", brought to you by organized crime... A very naughty part of me is tempted to write "We Kill" on the left side of the sign.
Police officer
Apollo:
They're not letting anyone into the crime scene. The guard at the entrance is humming a song. He's got rhythm, actually. Maybe he plays in a band.

Talk
Progress report
Phoenix:
Well, I certainly didn't expect you back this early.
Trucy:
Polly's amazing! He found my panties so quick! Almost like he was the one who stole them!
Apollo:
...You have an interesting concept of praise.
Phoenix:
...And? Did you find the mad driver who gave me that 30-foot toss?
Apollo:
Apparently... it was a doctor. From the Meraktis Clinic.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Meraktis, eh? I've heard of him. Nothing good, mind you.
Apollo:
That reminds me, a police car was parked outside the clinic.
Trucy:
Maybe something happened?
Apollo:
What is this Meraktis Clinic anyway?
Meraktis Clinic
Phoenix:
All I've heard are the rumors. That clinic's been making good money... in a bad way.
Apollo:
Bad...?
Phoenix:
Ties to organized crime... The Kentucky Family.
Apollo:
Um... the Kitaki Family? (He did that on purpose!)
Phoenix:
Some injuries you can't take to a public hospital, see. They use the Meraktis Clinic for their patch-up jobs.
Apollo:
Interesting...
People Park
Trucy:
It looked like something had happened in that park.
Phoenix:
Ah. A body was found there in unusual circumstances...
Apollo:
Something more unusual than being dead?
Phoenix:
...It's not our concern, in any case.
Trucy:
Right! Let's ignore that and find that noodle stand!
Apollo:
(What ever happened to professional curiosity?)
After clearing all Talk options:
Phoenix:
...Thanks, really. If I get tired of sleeping, maybe I'll head down to this Meraktis place. Maybe hit 'em up for some reparations... A little legal action would do me some good.
Apollo:
Um... I was wondering when I get paid? We solved the case of your accident, and um, found a missing article of clothing.
Trucy:
My panties!
Phoenix:
That leaves the noodle stand.
Apollo:
Eh.
Phoenix:
Feel free to drop in if you get stuck. I'd be happy to help with anything not involving money.
Apollo:
(Good-bye, quid pro quo. Hello pro bono. *sigh*)
Trucy:
Right! Back to the office to plan our next move!

Wright Anything Agency
Apollo:
You... You're the woman from the Kitaki place!
???:
Y-Yes...
Trucy:
I knew it! Something's the matter and you want our help, right? Well, you've come to the Wright place! This way, please...
Alita:
Um... Thank you. My name is Alita Tiala. I... have a request.
Talk
Your request
Apollo:
Your request... let me guess, something's been stolen?
Alita:
Um, your flyer... It says "now defending" so I thought...
Apollo:
Whaaaat!? You mean, you mean you want me to defend you? Me?
Trucy:
Maybe you can tell us what happened? Were you hit by a car? Did someone steal your stand? Or your panties?
Alita:
No! No... I'm not the client, actually. The client would be my... well, my fiancé, I suppose you'd call him.
Apollo:
Fiancé...? What happened to him, then?
Alita:
He was arrested this morning. The charge... was murder.
Trucy:
Murder...
Alita:
Have you heard about what happened at the park?
Tiala's story
Apollo:
So, what's your story? You frequent the Kitaki Mansion, yes? Are you a member of their, um, organization?
Alita:
No... Not yet.
Trucy:
Not yet?
Alita:
You see, I'm to be married next month. To the boss's son.
Apollo:
The boss's son...? So he's a, uh... *gulp* (A gangster...)
Alita:
Yes, but the Kitakis are locally responsible gangsters. I thought it'd be nice for a change... Quit my boring job, live the good, gangster life.
Trucy:
I think you're on to something! "Ms. Kitaki"... I like the sound of that!
Apollo:
(I'm not sure your daddy would care much for that...)
Murder in the park (appears after "Your request")
Apollo:
Wh-What happened!?
Alita:
I haven't been told all the details. But I do know a body was found in the park. Near the Kitaki Mansion.
Trucy:
There were a lot of police cars there.
Alita:
Apparently, the victim was shot with a pistol... But I hear the circumstances of the shooting were... rather unusual.
Apollo:
And your fiancé was arrested for this?
Trucy:
Um... what sort of person is your fiancé?
Your fiancé (appears after "Tiala's story" and "Murder in the park")
Apollo:
Your fiancé is the Kitaki Family's only son, correct?
Alita:
His name's Wocky. Wocky Kitaki... I brought a photo.
Apollo:
Well. That's... quite the photo.
Alita:
I know! Oh, he can be powerful and menacing, but so cute!
Apollo:
But, if he's the boss's only son...
Alita:
Yes, I'm sure he'll take his father's place some day.
Trucy:
Say, I'm a boss already! Of this agency!
Alita:
Please help my Wocky! Please!
Apollo:
(...Right! My first solo defense case! Crime boss's son or not, I'll prove he's innocent!)

Alita:
An attorney's badge... So you really are a defense attorney. Please, I'm counting on you. I need your help.
Anything else
Alita:
I'm not sure I understand... I'm sorry.
Apollo:
No, no, it's me who's sorry, really! Sorry!
After clearing all Talk options:
Alita:
I... prepared a letter of request. I know you need those.
Letter of Request added to the Court Record.
Trucy:
Right! Let's go check out the scene of the crime!
Present
Letter of Request
Alita:
I hope that's OK? I've never written a letter of request before.
Apollo:
Oh, it's fine. (I should hope it's your first...)
Trucy:
If we take this we'll be able to investigate the scene!
Examine evidence
Letter of Request
Writing
Trucy:
Why does this envelope say "Hit Request"?
Apollo:
Um... it's a bit of lingo. Like "call in a hit", or a "hit man"...
Trucy:
Ooh, you mean gangster-talk!? So does "hit" mean "to defend" in gangster-ese? Well, "hit man"?
Apollo:
I certainly hope not... (Something tells me she used the wrong envelope...)

Apollo:
Huh...? Where's Mr. Wright?
Trucy:
Maybe he's getting an examination again?
Apollo:
How many does he need!? (Wasn't it just a sprain?)
Trucy:
Too bad, Polly! You wanted to show off your request to Daddy, didn't you!
Apollo:
What? Me? No!
Trucy:
Oh? That's a surprise.
Apollo:

Trucy:
Polly! You look as happy as a clam in its shell.
Apollo:
For a lawyer this is it, the place where the battle begins!
Guard:
...Ahem. You need something?
Apollo:
Aaah! Yes, we're attorneys. I was hoping we could see Mr. Wocky Kitaki?
Guard:
Sorry, he's in questioning right now. Could take a while.
Trucy:
Drat. Oh well, guess we'll have to come back later then.
Apollo:
So much for that battle...
Examine
Security camera
Apollo:
That security camera is looking at me. I wonder if they tape all of this.
Security guard
Apollo:
A security guard. He stands here, watching this room. I have no idea if he's listening to us talk. I'm not even sure he's breathing.
June 15Kitaki Mansion
Apollo:
(So this is it... My first murder crime scene!)
Officer:
Ah, it's you kids again. Look, can't you find some other place to play...
Trucy:
We're not playing! We're um, "investigating"! Aren't we, Apollo?
Apollo:
Sir, I have a letter of request here.
Officer:
Letter of... huh? Why does it say "Hit Request" on it?
Apollo:
(Ms. Tiala must have used the Kitaki's stationery...)
???:
Excuse me, coming through.
Officer:
Ah! It's you! Mr. Gavin!
Apollo:
...! (Who's this guy...?)
???:
I must say I'm used to being inspected by the ladies... But this is the first time I've felt this way with a man.
Apollo:
Mr.... Gavin?
???:
Ah, Fräulein. What is a sweet morsel like you doing in such a dismal place? Can I help?
Trucy:
... Y-Yes! The police man officer fellow here won't let us in! We even have a letter of request!
???:
You must be exhausted, standing out here! I will take you to the scene of the crime.
Trucy:
Oooh! R-Really!?
???:
...By your leave, Officer.
Officer:
Ya... Yes sir! Of course, sir!

Ah ha. Very well. This way, Fräulein...

Trucy:
Thank you! Will we see you again...?

Trucy:
Eeeeeeeeeek! Apollo! Look! A c-corpse!
Apollo:
Whaaaat!? ...Hey, it's just a mannequin.
Trucy:
Wow. It sure got me.
???:
Ahem. Might I ask exactly what it is you're doing here? Oh, it's you. How did you kids get in here?
Trucy:
Oh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in...
???:
Him again. That glimmerous fop, always getting in my way... Anyway! This scene is off limits.
Apollo:
Excuse me? We have a letter of request!
???:
...Hmm. One moment.
Apollo:
(Why is she holding that big magnifying glass...?)
???:
.............................. I'd recognize that handwriting anywhere. Scientific analysis says this was written by Alita Tiala.
Apollo:
...Thanks. (It took you thirty minutes to figure that out!?) So... what's up with the mannequin there?
???:
It's taking the place of the body, preserving the scene of the crime as it was found.
Apollo:
(The body... was pulling the stand!?)
Ema:
So, you're a defense attorney, are you? Detective Ema Skye. I'm in charge of this crime scene.
Trucy:
She doesn't seem that happy about it.
Apollo:
...She doesn't seem that happy about many things.
Ema:
I trust you know how to stay out of the way. I always carry two pairs of handcuffs... just in case.
Examine
Noodle stand
Ema:
Hey there! No messing with the crime scene!
Apollo:
B-But we need to investigate!
Trucy:
Apollo! Look! That stand! ... It says "Eldoon"!
Apollo:
...I've noticed. Well, we've solved the case of the missing stand at least. ...Though the circumstances could stand to be better.
Anywhere else
Ema:
Hey there! No messing with the crime scene!
Apollo:
B-But we need to investigate!
Ema:
Investigations are to be carried out by professionals, scientifically!
Apollo:
(She's not going to let us check out the crime scene, is she...)
Trucy:
Hey, Apollo. My very un-scientific analysis tells me something here is very suspicious...
Apollo:
...I think I know what you mean. It's kind of hard not to notice. (I'd better check out what we came here to find at least.)
Talk
Any option
Apollo:
Um, Detective Skye...?
Ema:
Quiet, please. It's snack time. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
Trucy:
We're not making much progress here.
Apollo:
(She must not be very busy...)
Ema:
*sigh* I never seem to get a lucky break. Back after nine years, and they won't give me the position I requested... ...And then I hear he gave up the defense attorney life...
Apollo:
(He? Who's he? An ex-defense attorney...?)
Present
Anything
Apollo:
Um, if you could spare a moment to take a look at this?
Ema:
...Can't you see that I am extremely, extremely busy?
Apollo:
(...Eating snacks, yes.)
Trucy:
Busy eating snacks, I'd say.
Apollo:
(This is going nowhere fast.)
June 15Eldoon's House
Trucy:
Oh, Mr. Eldoon...! Hello?
Apollo:
Looks like he left.
Trucy:
And we found his stand and everything! What about our free bowl!?
Apollo:
Oh, too bad, looks like we'll have to wait a little longer for that bowl. So sorry.
Trucy:
Aw, what a bummer.
Examine
Clinic front door
Apollo:
The front entrance to the Meraktis Clinic. The walls and posts are so highly polished I can see my face in them. ... Hot dang, my hair looks good.
Green banner
Apollo:
Looks like this is a banner for some campaign. "Three shots for the price of one"... Somehow I don't see people lining up for that.
Police car
Apollo:
A police car is parked in front of the Meraktis Clinic. It's empty. The police must be inside investigating.
Blue tarp
Apollo:
The blue tarp Mr. Eldoon used to cover his noodle stand. Robbed of its purpose, it blows in the wind... alone.
Bowl
Apollo:
A lone Eldoon's Noodles bowl lies on the ground. The lone bowl, tipped on its side... It's kind of surreal.
House
Apollo:
Mr. Eldoon's house has seen better days. And I'm betting I've eaten better noodles.
"NOO" sign
Apollo:
This must be his business sign. It reads "NOO". Maybe that's how the kids are spelling "new" these days. Another failed attempt at hipster marketing.
Oil drum
Apollo:
An oil drum for catching rainwater. ...Ack! A sparrow just flew over and... Aw man, that was just disgusting! Something tells me this wasn't the first time.
Sign under oil drum
Apollo:
There's a hand-written sign here... "Save the light!" It's hard to make out the sign in the shade from the clinic next door.
Spoon the dog
Apollo:
Guy Eldoon's dog doesn't look too lively. They say dogs and their owners resemble each other... I guess there are exceptions.
June 15Hickfield Clinic
Phoenix:
Ah, you're back! Run into some problems?
Trucy:
Oh, Polly, didn't you want to tell Daddy something?
Apollo:
Who? Me? No! I'm fine. Really.
Phoenix:
What's this? So there is a problem?
Apollo:
No, no problem. Actually, I got a defense request.
Phoenix:
A defense request! That is a problem.
Apollo:
Huh...?
Phoenix:
I've given up the court. I'm not a lawyer anymore.
Apollo:
... The request was for me!
Phoenix:
Oh, right. You're a lawyer, aren't you?
Apollo:
(He's doing that on purpose! I know it!)
Talk
Murder
Phoenix:
So, what about this defense request?
Apollo:
It's related to the murder in People Park, actually.
Trucy:
Guess what! We found Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand at the scene of the crime!
Phoenix:
Did you now. That's unusual indeed. Never heard of a noodle stand being used as a murder weapon.
Apollo:
...Uh, I think the murder weapon was something else.
Phoenix:
You mean you don't know what the murder weapon was?
Trucy:
That funny detective lady won't let us on the scene! What kind of detective wears a lab coat, anyway!?
Phoenix:
A lab coat? Hmm. Didn't think she'd be involved with this...
Apollo:
...You know her?
Phoenix:
You could say that.
Skye connection (appears after "Murder")
Apollo:
So... you know her, don't you?
Phoenix:
I met her on a case... this was about ten years ago. She was still a high school student at the time.
Apollo:
(That would make her about the same age as me!)
Trucy:
That's my daddy! He knows all the police types. Oh, wait! Maybe you know that other guy, too!
Apollo:
That other guy...?
Trucy:
That shining prince on the motorcycle!
Phoenix:
...Prince?
Mysterious Prince (appears after "Skye connection")
Phoenix:
Apollo. Tell me about this "prince" of Trucy's. Indulge a concerned father...
Apollo:
He was at the crime scene... He looked just like Mr. Gavin!
Phoenix:
... Did he now.
Apollo:
...You know him?
Phoenix:
My guess is he's Kristoph Gavin's younger brother...
Apollo:
His brother!?
Phoenix:
We're acquaintances, after a fashion. Klavier Gavin... rock 'n' roll god incarnate.
Trucy:
Klavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy!
Apollo:
(I didn't know Mr. Gavin had a brother! And what was he doing out there?)
Phoenix:
I have a feeling you'll be crossing paths again soon.
After clearing all Talk options:
Phoenix:
...Now, what was the problem again? Having trouble investigating the crime scene in the park?
Trucy:
Yeah. That detective woman won't let us!
Phoenix:
...Go to the office. Under the silk top hat you'll find a bottle of white powder. Try taking that to this detective.
Apollo:
"White powder"...? (I hope it's not what I think it is.)
Phoenix:
Just take it to her. It'll be fine, you'll see. Oh, and tell her I said hi.
Wright Anything Agency (after clearing all Talk options with Phoenix Wright)
Examine
Silk hat
Leads to:
"So this must be the "silk top hat" Mr. Wright mentioned."
Talk
The case
Trucy:
Hmm... I think we should focus on finding more information about the case.
Apollo:
You seem to be having fun.
Trucy:
Of course! This is my first criminal investigation! And it's so mysterious! A noodle stand pushing a dead man along...
Apollo:
...Uh, I think it was the other way around. The dead man was pulling the stand. But you're right about it being mysterious.
Trucy:
I knew it! More information, that's what we need!
Apollo:
So this must be the "silk top hat" Mr. Wright mentioned. Let's take a closer look... Huh?
Trucy:
Whoa!
Apollo:
You know what this is, Trucy?
Trucy:
I... remember finding some in Daddy's dresser when I was little. I thought it was sugar, so I licked it... He got mad at me.
Apollo:
(This is getting more and more suspicious...)
White powder placed gingerly into pocket.
Trucy:
Let's go talk to that detective! She's sure to know what that white powder is!
Examine evidence
White Powder
Label
Apollo:
Hmm. The bottle has a label on it.
Trucy:
Can you read it?
Apollo:
Uh, not a word. I'm not sure I speak whatever language this is written in.
Trucy:
That's too bad. I guess we're stuck with this mysterious bottle of white powder...
People Park (after examining silk hat in Wright Anything Agency)
Present
White Powder
Apollo:
Um... Does this ring any bells?
Ema:
Ah! Is that--!? It couldn't!? Where'd you get that?
Apollo:
I brought it from the office.
Ema:
You... work at the Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices, yes?
Apollo:
Er, yeah, sort of...
Trucy:
Detective Skye! How do you know my daddy?
Ema:
D-D-Daddy!? I'm sorry, who did you say you were?
Trucy:
Trucy Wright. Phoenix Wright's daughter.
Ema:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Wright has a daughter!?
Trucy:
You seem shocked.
Ema:
W-Well, if you're Mr. Wright's daughter and you're his apprentice... ...then I'm available to help you in any way I can!
Apollo:
Oh, uh, thanks. (You can start by not calling me Mr. Wright's apprentice!)
Ema:
This powder is used for detecting fingerprints.
Apollo:
Fingerprints...?
Ema:
I guess you might call it a memento... from the time I spent with Mr. Wright.
Apollo:
(White powder memories...)
Ema:
If you find any evidence with fingerprints on it, please let me know! We'll dust for prints!
Apollo:
(Well, she's quite the eager beaver all of a sudden...)
Examine
Benches
Apollo:
Benches line the river running through the park.
Trucy:
Ahh, a little urban oasis. I bet children come here to splash around in the water.
Apollo:
That river's a little deep for splashing... and a little dirty.
Trucy:
Well, they could listen to the water and pretend they were playing.
Blue tarps
Apollo:
Blue tarps have been placed on the ground around the stand.
Trucy:
Apollo! I bet the victim was going to have a picnic here!
Apollo:
...I guess he could have eaten all the noodles he wanted.
Ema:
Don't touch those! Those are preserving the crime scene!
Apollo:
(Oh, I guess the police put these tarps here after all.)
Knife
Apollo:
It's... a knife!
Ema:
A "shiv" to be precise.
Trucy:
Ooh... lingo!
Ema:
The defendant, Wocky Kitaki, is the son of known gangsters. The police are assuming this belongs to him.
Apollo:
(Wait, but wasn't the murder weapon a pistol...?) Huh? Look at this, there's a handprint on this shiv...
Ema:
A handprint? Then there might be a fingerprint. Let's investigate!
Ema:
Right! First, choose the fingerprint you want to examine.
Apollo:
...Choose a fingerprint?
Ema:
Look closely at the handle. See? There's more than one fingerprint there.
Trucy:
Those black spots?
Ema:
That's right. Pick the one you want to analyze.
Darkest finger
Leads to:
"Right! Let's get detecting!"
Ema:
Right! Let's get detecting!
Apollo:
(Wow, she's practically glowing with excitement...)
Ema:
First, sprinkle some aluminum powder over the print. Just touch the screen, like this. See? The oil left by the print absorbs the aluminum powder, so you just dust it on... ...and blow it off!
Trucy:
B-Blow?
Ema:
It's like whistling. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just put your lips together...
Trucy:
Wow! Amazing! It's like magic!
Ema:
Heh heh. Isn't it though?
Apollo:
(Right, let's give it a shot!)
Ema:
Incidentally, it's important that you cover the entire fingerprint with the powder.
Ema:
Hmm, good... clear... Quite impressive! Next, to match the print. The police office has samples so you can tell whose finger this print belongs to.
Apollo:
Hmm... That doesn't sound like as much fun as actually finding the print.
Ema:
OK, pick the person whose print you think this is. You probably have a good idea whose knife this is already.

Apollo:
So... the fingerprints do belong to the defendant.
Ema:
Yes! Isn't it amazing? Ah, the power of science. It's my life.
Trucy:
Apollo, she's... sparkling.
Apollo:
And I'm dimming.
Ema:
Look sharp, spirits up. The real fight is yet to come!
Trucy:
Chin up, Polly!
Apollo:
(The trial hasn't even started and I'm already losing...)
Knife added to the Court Record.
Knife (subsequent times)
Apollo:
A knife is sticking straight into the ground.
Trucy:
With the defendant's fingerprints on it... Which means... You think he stuck it into the victim?
Apollo:
(I don't know what he did with it but I don't like it.)
Mannequin
Apollo:
This mannequin is dressed up to look like a police officer. I've seen one at the station. (A mannequin in place of a body...)
Ema:
The body of the victim has already been removed.
Trucy:
Do you think the victim was the noodle stand thief?
Apollo:
What, you think someone killed him because he stole it?
Trucy:
Yeah! Taking care of business, Little Plum Kitaki style!
Apollo:
(Try not to sound too eager about that, please...)
Noodle stand
Apollo:
...And this is Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand, obviously.
Trucy:
It does say "Eldoon" in big letters, doesn't it!
Apollo:
And that mark on his paper lantern there looks familiar.
Trucy:
It's going to be a little weird telling him... what with the corpse and all...
Apollo:
Anyway, that wraps up three of our cases.
Trucy:
That's right! Congratulations, Apollo!
Apollo:
(And leaves us with one case that's worse than all three put together... Murder.)
Trash can
Apollo:
(There's got to be a good clue or two around here...)
Trucy:
You and your trash cans! Go ahead, knock yourself out.
Apollo:
Please, can't you see I'm doing my... Huh? L... Look! Another pair of underwear!?
Trucy:
Wow, Apollo! You're a genius at finding panties!
Apollo:
Stop saying that. Wait, these aren't...?
Trucy:
Th-They're not mine!
Apollo:
(Could these have been stolen, too?)
Bloomers added to the Court Record.
Trash can (subsequent times)
Trucy:
I'll always remember this trash can as "the place where Apollo found those bloomers"!
Apollo:
Don't you have more important things to remember? Wait, these aren't...?
Trucy:
Th-They're not mine!
Apollo:
(Could these have been stolen, too?)
Talk
The case
Ema:
The report came in late last night. The body was found much as you see it now. ...Except it was a real body.
Apollo:
But... why?
Ema:
Why was a body pulling a noodle stand? If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't still be here.
Apollo:
Well, what was the cause of death...?
Ema:
A bullet wound, to the temple. ...He was shot by a pistol.
Trucy:
A pistol?
Ema:
Not the easiest thing to come by in this day and age.
Apollo:
(Unless you're a cop... or a gangster.)
Ema:
Incidentally, the victim's name was Pal Meraktis. I just received the autopsy report, in fact.
Meraktis's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Ema:
I mean, really! What's up with this case!? It's enough to make me want to run off, pulling a mysterious noodle stand behind me...
Trucy:
Not so mysterious, actually... We should tell her, Apollo! After all, we know where the stand came from!
Ema:
A likely story! I didn't come here to play games, you know.
Apollo:
Actually, we do know where the noodle stand came from. The noodle stand's owner is...
Present Guy Eldoon profile
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"... Who's the old guy?"
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Take that!
Ema:
... Look, I have better things to be doing. I'd make more progress eating snacks than listening to this drivel.
Apollo:
(You could try actually investigating, rather than just standing around.)
Ema:
... Who's the old guy?
Apollo:
This is the proprietor of Eldoon's Noodles, Mr. Eldoon himself!
Trucy:
He's famous in this part of town.
Ema:
Not bad. I guess Mr. Wright picked the right kids for the job. That saved me a lot of work. Thanks.
Noodle Stand added to the Court Record.
Trucy:
What sort of person was the victim, anyway?
Ema:
You mean what did he do? He was a doctor.
Apollo:
A doctor...? (I'm starting to see a connection here...)
Your story
Ema:
Who? Me? I'm just a supervisor for this crime scene.
Apollo:
(Detective Skye... Hmm.)
Ema:
I was out of the country for a while. I came back to be a forensic scientist.
Trucy:
Ooh! Were you studying abroad?
Ema:
Something like that. I was studying in Europe. Forensic sciences, mind you. But when I got back here, they threw me in criminal affairs! Just like that!
Trucy:
Why didn't you just become a forensics expert in Europe?
Ema:
Well, I suppose that was an option, but... I had a lot of favors to repay to people back here.
Apollo:
(Favors? Wasn't she in high school when she left?)
Ema:
What? What's that look for? I was involved in an... incident before I left. But Mr. Wright and his people helped me out. I owed them.
Trucy:
Really? I had no idea...
Apollo:
(If she's been out of the country for a while... ...she probably doesn't know about Mr. Wright's current, erm, "state of affairs".)
The defendant
Apollo:
Um... Could you tell us a bit about the defendant? He's the only son of the Kitaki Family, yes...?
Ema:
Wocky Kitaki. I don't know if he is the boss's son, but he's certainly throwing his weight around... ...Violently. In the detention center.
Trucy:
I see.
Apollo:
Why was he arrested in the first place?
Ema:
... You are a defense attorney, aren't you? You're not his, by any chance?
Apollo:
Er, a-actually, yes, I am.
Ema:
Well... We have a witness to the moment of the crime.
Apollo:
Eh...?
Ema:
The witness called the police. They'll be testifying during the trial tomorrow.
Trucy:
Whaaaaaaaa--!?
The victim (appears after "The case")
Apollo:
Could you tell us a bit more about the victim?
Ema:
Well, let's see... Apparently he's the physician at a clinic in the area. Quite well off, too, from the sound of it. The clinic's name is... The Meraktis Clinic.
Trucy:
Hmm... Maybe that's why the cop car was parked there?
Ema:
What? You've been to the clinic?
Apollo:
(I told the detective about the case of the stolen noodle stand.)
Ema:
...I see... So that means... ...Dr. Meraktis stole the stand and pulled it all the way here?
Apollo:
That would seem to be the case.
Ema:
... But why?
Apollo:
Don't ask me!
Present
Attorney's Badge
Ema:
Ah, an attorney's badge. It reminds me of when Mr. Wright was still defending. Everything I have now is thanks to him. Remember, help as many people as you can. That's your job!
Trucy:
She's right, Polly! Let's make a difference! ...Is something wrong?
Apollo:
Ah! Ah, no! N-Nothing. (I... I actually felt inspired for a moment there.)
Fingerprint Powder
Ema:
Fingerprint analysis is the very basis of modern forensic science! Doesn't just talking about it leave you breathless with excitement?
Apollo:
Oh yes. Breathless. (Actually, it does sound kinda interesting...)
Ema:
Let me know if you find any evidence that might have a  print or two, alright?
Knife
Ema:
The defendant's fingerprints were found on that knife.
Trucy:
Which means that, at the very least, he was here at the scene of the crime...?
Ema:
It's highly possible, yes.
Apollo:
Ugh. This doesn't look good.
Ema:
No use worrying about what's out already! You just worry about what's yet to come!
Meraktis's Autopsy Report
Ema:
Why did Dr. Meraktis die like this...?
Trucy:
Pulling a noodle stand... Very strange.
Ema:
Inconceivable! I just don't get it! Some people just can't die normally!
Apollo:
(He's dead, give him a break.)
Anything else
Ema:
Sorry... I don't think I can help you with that. I think you need more than just scientific help. But ask me anything you like! ...Just ask scientifically.
Examine evidence
Fingerprint Powder
Label
Apollo:
The label reads "Fingerprint Powder" in some strange language.
Trucy:
How do we know for sure? What if this is really a jar for something else, like jam, or honey?
Apollo:
Why would anyone go through the trouble?
Trucy:
Well, so the police don't find out, that's why!
Apollo:
I hardly think possessing fingerprint powder is a crime. 
Trucy:
Oh, huh, I guess. That's boring.
Bloomers
Back side
Trucy:
These bloomers sure have a... distinct design!
Apollo:
You certainly know who they belong to at a glance.
Trucy:
That way, she doesn't have to write her name on them! Genius!
Apollo:
...I would think writing your name would be easier than drawing a plum blossom.
Knife
Fingerprint
Trucy:
So, the defendant's prints are on this knife...
Apollo:
That would mean he was here the night of the crime.
Trucy:
That's what I call irrefutable scientific evidence! Neat!
Apollo:
Not so neat when it happens to be evidence against our client...
Noodle Stand
"NOODLE" sign
Trucy:
Huh? Look at this, Apollo! Mr. Eldoon spelled his name backwards on this side!
Apollo:
Um, I think that says "Noodle". As in "Eldoon's Noodles".
Trucy:
Huh... Oh, I get it! So the name of his store is the same whether you read it forward or backwards!
Apollo:
Yeah... I guess it would be. Well, except for the last "s".
Trucy:
...... Then, how about a store called "Team Meat"?
Apollo:
Uh, close, but that would be "Taem Maet" backwards. And what kind of store is that?
Trucy:
Why, a store that sells meat! "It's not meat, useless it's Team Meat!"
After examining trash can and knife, and clearing all Talk options:
Ema:
So... have you met the defendant?
Apollo:
Ah. Uh... No.
Ema:
Visiting hours are almost over at the detention center. You might think about wrapping up here and heading over.
Apollo:
Good idea. (I don't know what good it will do. We have a witness, and a knife with prints... Have I mentioned I've got a bad feeling about this?)
Ema:
Don't worry, it's like a Wright tradition.
Apollo:
(Some traditions I can live without.)
June 15
Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Guard:
I'm sorry. Meeting hours for the day are all done.
Apollo:
B-But we still have three minutes!
Guard:
I'll put in your request, but don't expect anything. The father's talking in the private room with him.
Trucy:
The father? You mean like a priest?
Guard:
I mean the suspect's father, Mr. Winfred "Big Wins" Kitaki himself.
Apollo:
(Not someone I care to meet...)
???:
...Die you--!!!
???:
...You're the one on your way out, old--!!!
Apollo:
......
Trucy:
.........
Guard:
Ah. They're here.
Apollo:
(Whoa! This guy radiates power! Power.. with a cute apron?)
???:
You Wocky's lawyer?
Apollo:
Y-Yes, sir!
Big Wins:
Well, I'm Big Wins Kitaki, fourth head of the Kitaki family... capice?
Apollo:
Er... Actually, I came to speak to your son.
Big Wins:
... Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
Yes?
Big Wins:
My son's innocent. He killed no one. If he were found guilty... it wouldn't be good. ...Capice?
Apollo:
Y-Yes! I'm all about capicing! Capice'd loud and clear!
Big Wins:
You gotta do more than just understand to make it. You'll learn, though. Even if the lesson comes at the end of your short life.
Apollo:
(I don't feel so good...)
Wocky:
What's the big idea, old man! You can't treat me like a kid no more, not now! You know I... I... I wanted to go to the clink! I like it here!
Apollo:
You... must be Wocky?
Wocky:
A G's not a G till he does hard time! Bizzoooy! You'll see. When I get out of here, things'll change!
Big Wins:
Silence! My apologies, Mr. Justice... He's usually such a nice boy.
Apollo:
(Forgive me if I have a hard time believing that.)
Wocky:
Ha! You can't take me under your wing this time, old man! You heard me! I don't need no trial! I did it!
Big Wins:
...I think that's enough for today, Mr. Justice. Don't let me down tomorrow.
Apollo:
So much for talking to our client.
Trucy:
But we made so much progress today! We even found my panties! I had fun, at least.
Apollo:
Of course, the biggest mystery of all remains... (How am I supposed to build a case for the trial!?)
Trucy:
Oh, almost forgot, it's time for my show! Tonight I'm performing at the Wonder Bar! You should come check it out.
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Apollo:
No clues here.
