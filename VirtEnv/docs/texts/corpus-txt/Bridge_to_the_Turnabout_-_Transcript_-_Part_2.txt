District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Iris:
Oh my... Mr. Laurice feels that way about... me...?
Edgeworth:
Apparently... he isn't aware of your real secret at all.
Iris:
... ......
Edgeworth:
This is no time to be embarrassed!
Iris:
I-I'm sorry! I'm just... hardly accustomed to that sort of thing.
Edgeworth:
Worry not... And in any case, whatever it was that he saw on the night of the incident... Mark my words, I will drag it out him!
Iris:
Does that mean... Mr. Laurice is the witness today...?
Edgeworth:
...No. I believe that nun... will be the first to take the stand.
Iris:
Sister Bikini...
Edgeworth:
She claims to have seen the very instant in which you carried out the crime.
Iris:
...
Edgeworth:
I just want to ask you one last time. It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct?
Iris:
... That is correct. It wasn't me.
Edgeworth:
...Very well then.
Iris:
Um... Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
...Yes?
Iris:
You are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed...
Edgeworth:
Don't worry. ...I've taken the necessary steps.
Iris:
Y-You have...?
Edgeworth:
...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people.
Iris:
...
Edgeworth:
But right now... I am a defense attorney. A defense attorney's job is to believe in people, and to believe until the bitter end. That's what a friend of mine told me once.
Iris:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
You may pass judgment on me from the defendant's chair. You are the one to decide... ...whether or not I am able to do the task I have been entrusted.
Iris:
... ...Very well, sir. I leave my defense in your capable hands.
February 9, 10:00 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 7
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple.
Edgeworth:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
...The defense does indeed appear to be ready... However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case.
Edgeworth:
...Indeed.
Judge:
I'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant...
Objection!
???:
The prosecution... stands ready.
Judge:
A-And you are...?
von Karma:
Franziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy.
Judge:
V-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma?
von Karma:
... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case.
Judge:
Y-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
I'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once...
Edgeworth:
...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor.
Judge:
Ms. von Karma? Do you have anything to say?
von Karma:
... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office.
Judge:
There... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack!
von Karma:
...I told you, there is no such weakling!
Judge:
Wh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom!
Judge:
B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at...
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
...I have no objection to the whip.
Judge:
Y-You don't...?
Edgeworth:
The prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today!
von Karma:
This promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers!
Edgeworth:
...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic.
Judge:
Allow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!
von Karma:
...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!
von Karma:
The murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.
Judge:
The sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.
Crime Photo added to the Court Record.
von Karma:
There is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime.
Judge:
...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand!
Edgeworth:
(And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!)
von Karma:
...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please.
Judge:
H-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight!
Edgeworth:
If I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.
Judge:
Bailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!
von Karma:
...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.
Bikini:
Little old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.
Judge:
... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!
von Karma:
...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!
Judge:
Y-You want me to leave!?
Bikini:
No need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!
Edgeworth:
In any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.
Bikini:
That's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...
Judge:
Let us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!
Witness Testimony
-- The Night of the Murder --
Bikini:
That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...
Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.
So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.
There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.
It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!
Judge:
Hmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?
Bikini:
...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.
Edgeworth:
(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)
von Karma:
There is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- The Night of the Murder --
Bikini:
That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
What is this Inner Temple...?
Bikini:
Well, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right?
Judge:
We'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam.
Bikini:
...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training.
Edgeworth:
And how exactly do you help with this process...?
Bikini:
It is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising.
von Karma:
Like a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies.
Edgeworth:
(A tutor with a whip, in your case.) If that is the case... ...then why did you return to Hazakura Temple, where the murder took place?
Bikini:
Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Violently...?
Bikini:
That's right. It's no laughing matter, especially in winter! I can't hold anything heavier than a knife and fork during the cold months! Just being alive is like strict training! Wah ha ha! Wha ha! Wah ha ha!
Edgeworth:
On the night of the murder, was this fabulous back of yours hurting again...?
Bikini:
That's right. Raging like a bull in a pigpen. I almost fainted once or twice! I just knew that unless I warmed it up, it was going to finally finish me off!
Bikini:
So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You "left Iris to help"... With what?
Bikini:
What do you think? The acolyte's training, of course. It was just past 10 PM, so we were starting to enter into the training exercises proper.
Judge:
Wasn't it your place to remain with the disciple?
Bikini:
Well, the job is simply to watch over the acolyte so that they don't pass away.
Edgeworth:
Just to confirm this point again, that night... ...you met Iris in the Inner Temple, correct?
Bikini:
Yes, yes. She's a gentle, honest girl. She's never once failed to follow my directions.
Present Iris' Testimony
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...Witnesses have to undergo their own trials, I'm afraid. The defendant's fate rests on their powers of observation and memory, after all.
Bikini:
Well, well, well. Don't worry! I'm more than up to the task! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.
Edgeworth:
In that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all!
Bikini:
N... No...! She said that...?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
A defendant or a witness... Who is more likely to lie, do you suppose? The defendant is simply lying to cover her back!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she "went to the Inner Temple" would make for a much better alibi.
von Karma:
...!
Bikini:
But that is odd... Whatever the reason... I can't believe that she would lie...!
Judge:
Hmm... she does indeed have honest eyes! Uwaaaah!
von Karma:
...All people lie. That is my belief.
Judge:
Why am I the only one being whipped in here...!? Anyway! Neither the witness nor the defendant have any reason to lie! Which means... We must call your memory into question...
Bikini:
Dear, dear, dear. You're older than me and yet you want to play that game, do you?
Judge:
A-Ah, well, that isn't exactly what I...
Bikini:
My memory is perfect! Crystal clear! Especially in winter!
Judge:
Then... I suppose it's too early to end this cross-examination, eh. Mr. Edgeworth. If you are going to question the memory of this witness... ...you will need to show me a more decisive piece of evidence.
Edgeworth:
...Understood, Your Honor. (I was naïve to think that alone would do the trick.)
Judge:
Then please add your comments aboot Iris to the testimony... And let us return to the cross-examination.
Changes statement from "So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple." to "Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner."
Bikini:
Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you sure that you're not making a mistake...?
Bikini:
...You, young man, need to get your estimation of me up from the floor!
Edgeworth:
Nngh...!
Bikini:
Iris always wears the same clothes. The smallest thing out of place would have stood out like a sore thumb to me! You're making a mistake, thinking I made a mistake!
Judge:
...An excellent finish there, witness.
Edgeworth:
(Still, I have to wonder...)
Present Iris's Hood
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"...Witness. Let's get one thing straight."
Bikini:
There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
...So you returned to the Hazakura Temple in order to take a bath?
Bikini:
My back is to blame for everything. It's a "do or be done in" kind of world, after all.
Edgeworth:
How long were you in the bath for, if you don't mind me asking?
Bikini:
... My my my, what a filthy little rogue you are! I know what's on your mind!
Edgeworth:
...?
Bikini:
I bet your next question is going to be, "Where exactly did you wash?" Ah, THIS is why you have to watch the young ones...
Edgeworth:
W-What are you going on about!? I was... Gwah!
von Karma:
...Pathetic, Miles Edgeworth.
Judge:
The lowest of the low.
Edgeworth:
(Is there some sort of "Kick Me" sign stuck to the defense's bench!?)
Bikini:
Anyway, I couldn't afford to be away from my post for too long, you understand, so...
Bikini:
It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The crime took place in the courtyard, correct...?
Bikini:
When you go from my room to the Main Hall... ...you have to take a winding hallway from which you can see the courtyard.
von Karma:
That's right. In other words... ...it was pure coincidence that the witness saw the crime taking place before her eyes. There was no complicated set-up in this case!
Judge:
Hmm... That certainly seems to be true.
Edgeworth:
(There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.)
Edgeworth:
...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this "Demon-Warding Hood", correct?
Bikini:
Of course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
H-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!?
Edgeworth:
That's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung.
von Karma:
W... What!?
Edgeworth:
...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!
Bikini:
Well well well!
Edgeworth:
(It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa!
von Karma:
...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you?
Bikini:
Spares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them.
Judge:
I see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh?
Bikini:
Each nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned...
Judge:
Hmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah!
von Karma:
If there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here!
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
(I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.)
Judge:
...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision.
Bikini:
I-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this...
von Karma:
Sister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple!
Edgeworth:
(Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the Judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.)
Witness Testimony
-- After My Bath --
Bikini:
I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.
And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...
Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!
Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.
The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.
Judge:
You saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that.
Edgeworth:
(This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...)
von Karma:
I would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Calling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours?
Cross Examination
-- After My Bath --
Bikini:
I finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
...How far is it from your room to the Inner Temple?
Bikini:
Let me think a moment... About twenty minutes, on these stumps of mine. It's about 15 minutes to Dusky Bridge from Hazakura Temple. The Inner Temple is just beyond the bridge.
von Karma:
Still, you never made it back there that night, did you?
Bikini:
T-That's right... I was heading along the walkway toward the Main Hall...
Bikini:
And as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You say you heard a noise...?
Bikini:
"Thump"... Just like that.
von Karma:
...That could only be the sound of the victim falling.
Bikini:
It's very quiet in the temple, you know. You can even hear the snow falling from the branches. "Thump"... Just like that.
Judge:
But then, couldn't this noise you heard have been snow falling to the ground?
Bikini:
... I never thought of that. Wah ha ha. Wha ha ha. Ha ha...
Judge:
Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh. Hoh hoh... Uaaaaaah!
von Karma:
The next one to laugh gets a whipping!
Bikini:
Well. Whatever the source of the sound, I looked over at the courtyard and...
Bikini:
Iris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
...This is the second time that the witness has testified to seeing the defendant. But... some doubt remains in these claims.
Bikini:
Hey, just what does that mean!? Just because you're a good-looking young man doesn't give you the right to...
Edgeworth:
The murderer who stabbed the victim with the sword... Sister Bikini, try to recall exactly who it was you saw! As clearly as you can!
Bikini:
Hmm... Well. You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you. ... Oh! Now that you mention it... There was something awfully strange about her... Something that has been bugging me all this time!
Edgeworth:
...Please, don't keep us in suspense.
Bikini:
Her hood!
von Karma:
Her hood...?
Bikini:
That's right! ...It's coming back to me... Iris... She wasn't wearing her hood! I thought something was out of place, but... It all makes sense now, doesn't it? After all, she'd given that hood away to someone, right?
Edgeworth:
...Urk!
von Karma:
Hah... You've dug your own grave, Miles Edgeworth!
Judge:
What do you say, Mr. Edgeworth? Is this testimony important?
It's not important
Edgeworth:
(...This line of questioning is only going to tear the  wound open further.) These statements are as useless as the investigations of a certain detective. ...There is no need to record them.
Judge:
Hmm...
Judge:
Very well. ...Please, continue with your testimony.
von Karma:
Hmph...
Leads back to cross-examination
It's important
Edgeworth:
(This may initially appear to put me at a disadvantage... But, I can't see any other leads at the moment...) ...Your Honor. I would like these new statements to be added to the testimony.
von Karma:
Heh... Miles Edgeworth.
von Karma:
If you want to hang yourself, you need only to ask. I'll gladly lend you my whip!
Judge:
Witness. Add that statement to your testimony.
Bikini:
...No problem.
Adds statement "Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on."
Bikini:
Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You are sure about that...?
Bikini:
Yes. After all, we always wear the same clothes. Ah! I don't mean because we're poor, you understand? It's our style. Yes, that's it!
Edgeworth:
...There's absolutely no need to explain yourself.
Bikini:
Anyway! She looked different from normal, so that really stuck out.
von Karma:
Like me holding a whippet puppy instead of my whip.
Edgeworth:
(At least then it might bite you and not someone else...)
Bikini:
Iris didn't have her hood on. I'm sure of it!
Judge:
...Very well. Now, please tell us aboot the victim, eh.
Bikini:
Mystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The room the victim was staying in overlooked the courtyard, correct?
Judge:
Which means... the victim's room was on the second floor?
Bikini:
No, no. Hazakura Temple is a single story building. But the mountain itself slopes downward... ...which elevates the Main Gate side of the temple and the guest rooms in the back... ...to about the height of a two story building.
Judge:
I see... And the victim was staying in one of these elevated rooms, correct?
Bikini:
Yes... I should know. I'm the one who carried her things to her room, after all...
Bikini:
The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
What makes you so sure of all this...?
Bikini:
It's just like I told you earlier... "I heard a noise from the courtyard." OK? "Thump"... Just like that.
von Karma:
You're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in bruises... ...indicating a fall from around 10 feet in height.
Judge:
Hmm... It appears that the witness was not mistaken then.
Bikini:
Yep. Yep. I'm more than just a pretty face. Especially in winter! I'm a woman of faith, after all. The head honcho of Hazakura Temple.
Edgeworth:
(There's only two of them working there...!)
von Karma:
What's wrong, Miles Edgeworth? No snappy comeback remark?
Edgeworth:
...
Present Elise's Autopsy Report
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway."
Edgeworth:
(...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.)
Edgeworth:
...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.
Bikini:
Oh please do! My brain is something else... especially in winter!
Edgeworth:
However... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report?
von Karma:
T-The autopsy report...?
Edgeworth:
The victim did fall from a  height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed.
von Karma:
Ah...!
Judge:
T-That's right! It says "after death" right here!
Edgeworth:
The scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!?
von Karma:
Aaah!
Judge:
O-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree?
von Karma:
Th-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the  courtyard below!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Were there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...?
von Karma:
...!
Edgeworth:
She was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree?
Judge:
W-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah!
von Karma:
...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room.
Judge:
...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah!
von Karma:
I'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood.
Judge:
When it produces the most blood...?
von Karma:
Very little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound.
Judge:
That's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking!
von Karma:
We have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events!
Edgeworth:
(I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!)
von Karma:
...Hmph...
Judge:
It seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate!
Bikini:
Don't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood!
von Karma:
Sister. Please give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here.
Edgeworth:
(...With the whip?)
Bikini:
...Oh, boy. Alright, alright...
Witness Testimony
-- Further Details --
Bikini:
When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.
Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.
I've never seen so much blood before...
That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?
And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!
Judge:
Hmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory...
von Karma:
Von Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
("Perfection" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...)

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
At that time... was the victim bleeding?
Bikini:
Well... I was very shocked to be seeing all this, of course... So I'm not entirely sure... But I don't think I saw any blood. Not then.
von Karma:
...I'm sure that you didn't. The weapon was acting as a plug in the wound.
Edgeworth:
In any case... Let's be clear on one very important point. Did you actually see the instant in which the victim was stabbed!?
Bikini:
Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
...Think carefully. This is very important.
Bikini:
It's Iris we are talking about here! I'm thinking for all I'm worth! ... No, when I looked over, the sword was already in Mystic Elise's body.
Judge:
Hmmmmmm...
Edgeworth:
(It might not be  conclusive, but... ...this testimony supports her theory.)
von Karma:
The victim was stabbed in her room and then dropped into the courtyard... ...I think this proves it rather well, Miles Edgeworth.
Bikini:
I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.

"Smoothly", you say... You're saying you saw the sword smoothly slide out?
Bikini:
That's right...
Bikini:
The whole thing happened right next to the gold statue of Mystic Ami. Mystic Elise was on the ground, and Iris was stooped over her. The sword was buried up to the hilt. When Iris stood up, the sword in her hand just slid out of Mystic Elise's body. It slid out from that gaping wound...! Aaaah...
Judge:
It goes without saying... that if the sword was removed there would be bleeding.
von Karma:
...Nothing out of place here.
Edgeworth:
(Is that really the case...? I can't help but feel that something about this testimony is very out of place... That something which couldn't possibly have happened... appears to have happened.)

Bikini:
T-That's right! Some of it had splattered onto Iris, too...
von Karma:
When the defendant was arrested, she was meditating in her room. And her blood-flecked clothing was neatly folded in the corner.
Edgeworth:
Wh-What!? (Her clothes were blood-flecked as well...?)
Judge:
Hmmm... That seems quite conclusive to me...
Edgeworth:
(What should I do...? Press this point further?)
Stop here

Edgeworth:
Going back to your previous statement... ...you said that you saw little bleeding when the victim was stabbed. But now... you say you saw the victim bleeding...?
Bikini:
Well, well. I say that what I saw is what I saw.
Judge:
W-What did you see?
Bikini:
Maybe I didn't see the poor woman get stabbed... But I saw the girl pull the sword out of her, plain as day.
Edgeworth:
Pulling the sword out...?
Bikini:
Well, it wasn't exactly pulling... It was more like it "came out".
Judge:
Witness! You will add this statement to your testimony!

Oh... Was that important...!?

Was the bleeding caused by the killer removing the sword...?
Bikini:
No mistaking it! I remember it all, clear as day!
Edgeworth:
...Don't you think that's a bit odd?
von Karma:
What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Why would the killer pull out the sword?
von Karma:
What...?
Edgeworth:
If all she wanted to do was place the weapon in the hand of the gold statue... ...then there was no reason to remove it from the body. All that would've accomplished is causing the victim to bleed unnecessarily. ...Your thoughts, Ms. von Karma?
von Karma:
T-That's...
Judge:
Indeed... It is strange, now that you mention it.
Edgeworth:
(I'm going to need to find an answer to this mystery, too...)
von Karma:
A-Anyway! The witness saw something terrible! ...So what did you do after that, witness?
Bikini:
That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Now, on to what the killer did next... You saw none of it? Correct?
Bikini:
Well... I was unconscious...
von Karma:
How long were you out for?
Bikini:
I don't know... 10, maybe 20 minutes...? A young man with a very prickly looking head woke me up. ...By stepping on me, actually.
Judge:
Hmm... I'm not sure I like that method of resuscitation!
Bikini:
Well, I wasn't asking for mouth-to-mouth, or anything of the sort... ...but I would've welcomed a more gentle awakening right about then, let me tell you.
Edgeworth:
...I shall have words with the offender personally. What did you see upon awakening...?
Bikini:
And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
By "Mystic Ami", you are referring to the golden statue, correct?
Bikini:
Just stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough.
Bikini:
But to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...!
von Karma:
Truly, a heinous, despicable crime.
Edgeworth:
It is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily...
von Karma:
Whatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem?
Edgeworth:
Exactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that?
von Karma:
...!
Judge:
Hmmmmm... No, I don't think I can.
von Karma:
... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts!
Bikini:
That's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself...
Edgeworth:
("There isn't always"... That phrase might come in handy someday.)
Edgeworth:
(There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.)
Edgeworth:
Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here.
Bikini:
W-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you.
von Karma:
What contradictions are you talking about?
Edgeworth:
In the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities!
Judge:
What do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah!
von Karma:
Explain yourself!
Edgeworth:
To start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that.
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
"Doesn't appear"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose!
Judge:
The objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly.
von Karma:
T-That's...
Edgeworth:
We also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a "plug" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
T-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction.
Judge:
Y-You've still got more!?
Edgeworth:
...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it?
von Karma:
Ah...!
Edgeworth:
If this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword!
von Karma:
Noooooo!
Judge:
Order! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa!
von Karma:
Bravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that!
Judge:
But what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but...
Edgeworth:
...Having come this far, there can only be one answer.
von Karma:
And that is...?
Edgeworth:
The weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito!
Judge:
W-Whaaaaaaaaat!?
von Karma:
A foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool.
Edgeworth:
Let's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon?
Bikini:
W-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it...
Edgeworth:
...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah!
von Karma:
So maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object.
Judge:
Hmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises.
Judge:
The obvious... question?
Edgeworth:
...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to?
von Karma:
...!
Edgeworth:
It goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a "sword-like object" was found.
von Karma:
T-That's...
Judge:
Answer the question, Ms. von Karma!
von Karma:
... No evidence of that kind was found.
Judge:
Hmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast!
Bikini:
Excuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually...
von Karma:
...What is it, Sister?
Bikini:
I was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there...
Judge:
... What exactly are you going on aboot here?
Bikini:
The murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of!
Edgeworth:
You what!?
von Karma:
Well then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister.
Edgeworth:
(Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?)
Witness Testimony
-- Location of the Weapon --
Bikini:
I saw the murder at around 11 PM...
And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.
And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!
It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!
Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?
...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...
Judge:
Hmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time.
Bikini:
Well. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know.
von Karma:
Quite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph.
Judge:
A snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory...
von Karma:
The tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge!
Tracks Photo added to the Court Record.
von Karma:
...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon!

I saw the murder at around 11 PM...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
...You are sure about the time?
Bikini:
Yes... I was worried about it, after all.
Judge:
Why was that?
Bikini:
Because I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple.
Edgeworth:
(Her estimation of the time seems reliable, at least.)
von Karma:
Please continue, Sister.
Bikini:
And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You asked Phoenix Wright to report the crime, correct?
Bikini:
Right, right, the one who trampled me.
Edgeworth:
(It seems she is the type to hold a grudge...)
Bikini:
There isn't a phone in the Main Hall, so I sent him to the bridge.
von Karma:
Phoenix Wright... He didn't even have his cell phone on him?
Edgeworth:
He had forgotten it at home, apparently.
von Karma:
What a naïve boy, as always! Not only do I always carry my phone, but I always have my whip in hand, too!
Bikini:
Anyway, I was really scared... And it was taking him a while to get back... So I thought I'd go out by the Main Gate for a spell.
Bikini:
And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
As I recall, there was a snowmobile outside the Main Gate when I visited.
Bikini:
That's it. That's the only one we have. It'll run no matter how much snow falls!
Edgeworth:
Now, you're certain the snowmobile was there at the Main Gate when you arrived?
Bikini:
Yes, of course. It was parked in front of the gate.
von Karma:
So... she had already gone, discarded the murder weapon, and returned by that time.
Edgeworth:
(...I'm not sure if this is really relevant... What should I do...?)

Edgeworth:
(...I need answers to every possible doubt.) The snowmobile in question... Was it still warm at that time?

Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean?
Judge:
What do you mean, eh?
von Karma:
What do you mean, Miles Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
(...I'm playing to a slow crowd here.) It goes without saying that using a snowmobile will heat its engine. If it was still warm, then it means it was recently used.
Bikini:
Ah! I see! I never thought of that!
Judge:
Hmmm, that's right! I overlooked that, too!
von Karma:
...Of course you did.
Edgeworth:
Then answer the question please, witness.
Bikini:
... I don't often go around touching hot engines...
Edgeworth:
...Hmm.
Bikini:
However... Now that you mention it... There wasn't any snow on it.
Judge:
Snow...?
Bikini:
Yes. For some reason, only the snowmobile wasn't covered in snow...
Edgeworth:
(There wasn't any snow on it!? Curses!)

It seems highly likely that the killer did use the snowmobile then, eh!

Bikini:
Ah! There's a reason for that! Have we got a moment for me to explain?
Judge:
I think that's why the question was asked in the first place...
Bikini:
...It was about a month ago. I was driving my beloved little snowmobile, happy as can be. I'd fetched some water and was heading back when I went and crashed into a tree! The tree and my back both went crunch. Just like that. Crunch.
Judge:
Hmm... Crunch.
Bikini:
...I haven't been able to find the courage to ride anything since then...
Bikini:
Anyway, the killer must have used it!
Bikini:
Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Refresh our memory. How long were you knocked out for...?
Bikini:

It's possible to get to the bridge and back in 10 minutes using the snowmobile...

Is that all you wish to concede, Miles Edgeworth?

Edgeworth:
I admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder.
von Karma:
You've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
However... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks?
von Karma:
What do you mean...?
Edgeworth:
Iris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to
the bridge, and those from coming back.
Bikini:
... Ah...! You're right!
von Karma:
Hmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...?
von Karma:
On the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it!
Judge:
I see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow.
von Karma:
What do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?)
It's flawless.
Edgeworth:
...The tracks leading to the bridge were covered by the snow.
Edgeworth:
I do not have any evidence that can dispute this claim.
von Karma:
...In which case, the rest is simple. Sister. Who was the only person who could have driven the snowmobile that night?
Bikini:
Well... that would be...!
von Karma:
...You can't hide it. I already know the answer.
Bikini:
......... It could only be Iris.
Judge:
A-And the reason being...!?
Bikini:
There is only one key for the snowmobile.
von Karma:
A key... that the defendant is responsible for!
Edgeworth:
Whaaaaat!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Now I don't feel like a clueless Puck Bunny! I understand everything! If the defendant did indeed use the snowmobile... ...which means that Iris is most definitely the murder--

What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?

There is one gaping hole in Ms. von Karma's claim!

Edgeworth:
Nngh... (I should have noticed it sooner...!)

"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory."
There is a contradiction.
Leads to:
"The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory."
Edgeworth:
The tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible.
von Karma:
... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction?
Edgeworth:
...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me.
Judge:
On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow!

Edgeworth:
Witness! Please tell us again what time it was when you witnessed the crime.
Bikini:
Like I said! It was around 11.
Edgeworth:
...Of course, this means that the weapon was thrown away after that time, correct? On that note... Please take a look at this data. It is the weather report for Eagle Mountain on the night of the murder.
Judge:
The... weather report...?
Edgeworth:
Snow started to fall at 7 PM... But it stopped at around 10:50.
von Karma:
...!
Edgeworth:
Therefore! When the Sister witnessed the crime at 11 PM... ...the snow had already stopped falling! It is impossible for any tracks made after that time to have been covered up!
von Karma:
Aaah!
Judge:
O-Order! Order!
Judge:
Very well then... It looks like Ms. von Karma's claim has been... snowed in. Waaaaaah!

...It's too soon to be closing this trial due to snow! Miles Edgeworth! How pathetic of you to rely on the weather of all things!
Edgeworth:

Answer me this, then! When is a weather report ever correct!?
Judge:
Ah, no, no no... You've got it all wrong. This isn't a forecast... This is... actual data... Gyaaaaah!

Forecast, data, all weather reports have some inaccuracies! It may have still been snowing in the vicinity well past 11 PM!
Judge:
Hmmmm... It's true. We cannot be totally sure, eh!

Edgeworth:
... Nothing else...?
Judge:
Nothing else.
von Karma:
Oh dear... You seem to have missed, Miles Edgeworth.

Nngh...!

(According to the witness's testimony, the incident occurred after 11 PM... In which case... ...there has to be evidence that can undeniably prove something doesn't match up!)
Leads back to:
"On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge..."
Edgeworth:
Ultimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed...
von Karma:
That's right. But proving that is...
Edgeworth:
Incredibly easy.
von Karma:
...!
Edgeworth:
If we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception.
von Karma:
And that is...?
Edgeworth:
The victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why!
von Karma:
Gnnngh!
Edgeworth:
In other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks!
von Karma:
Aaaaah!
Judge:
Order! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah!
von Karma:
J-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
(To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing. 
von Karma:
Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.
Edgeworth:
Then when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained.
Judge:
Hmmmmm...
Bikini:
Can I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me...
von Karma:
...What does, Sister?
Bikini:
There is only one key for the snowmobile.
Edgeworth:
...!
von Karma:
Furthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder!
Bikini:
...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple...
Edgeworth:
(But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...)
Bikini:
The snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot.
Judge:
...That sounds right.
Bikini:
But... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge.
von Karma:
Y-You must have just failed to see it, Sister.
Bikini:
Maybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too...
Edgeworth:
B-But that... isn't possible!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean?
von Karma:
...Nngh...
Edgeworth:
So then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple!
Judge:
Hmmmmmm...
Edgeworth:
(I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...)
Judge:
... I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...
Bikini:
Yes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything, everything that I know.
Judge:
Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem. If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile!
Edgeworth:
(A witness, huh...)
Judge:
Was there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night?
Bikini:
... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do.
Judge:
Hmmmm... That's a shame.
Edgeworth:
(Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!)
Edgeworth:
...Your Honor! I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.
Judge:
R-Really!?
von Karma:
...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...?
Edgeworth:
I don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind.
Judge:
Which are...?
Edgeworth:
First... that he saw "something incredible" on the night of the murder.
von Karma:
...And the second being?
Edgeworth:
This individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot.
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this idiot you're talking aboot!?
Present Larry Butz profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This guy must be a product of "Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting"..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Judge:
Just what is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth...? Are you saying that... this is the person who was near Dusky Bridge that night?
Edgeworth:
I-I did think so, however... Aaah!
von Karma:
You're the wandering idiot, Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Cool off before you try to take me on again! Ungh...! (What was I thinking!? This is the perfect chance to drag him onto the stand!)
Judge:
Hmmmm... Mr. Edgeworth. This individual... Did they really see the snowmobile that night?
Leads back to:
"I don't know for sure if he saw it or not..."
Judge:
This guy must be a product of "Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting"...
Edgeworth:
This is Larry Butz... The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim.
Judge:
Her student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder?
Edgeworth:
T-That's... (I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.) He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason.
von Karma:
And so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw?
Edgeworth:
I intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom.
Judge:
Summon this youth as a witness immediately!
von Karma:
... I have no choice, do I?
Edgeworth:
I believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him.
Judge:
...Very well.
Edgeworth:
(Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!)
Judge:
...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break. Ms. von Karma, please see to preparing the next witness.
von Karma:
...Understood, Your Honor.
Judge:
Good... Well then! Court is now in recess!
To be continued.

District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Iris:
Excuse me... Mr. Edgeworth? I'm not really sure what to say...
Edgeworth:
Iris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene.
Iris:
...Alright. I'll help
you any way I can.
Edgeworth:
First, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying.
Iris:
... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple.
Edgeworth:
...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile?
Iris:
... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me.
Edgeworth:
So it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge?
Iris:
... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth.
5 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Edgeworth:
Iris...
Iris:
I can't... tell you about that... yet.
Edgeworth:
"Yet"...?
Iris:
Not until her safety is confirmed...
Edgeworth:
Her?
Iris:
The safety of the acolyte...
Edgeworth:
(The "acolyte", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...)
Edgeworth:
... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim?
Iris:
... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life.
Edgeworth:
... (As I thought... no Psycholock...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough.
February 9, 11:36 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 7
Judge:
...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...?
von Karma:
During the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery.
Edgeworth:
Suspicious behavior...?
von Karma:
He was sketching something... Very intensely.
Judge:
Dare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained?
von Karma:
He drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip.
Judge:
... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah!
von Karma:
Anyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here!
Edgeworth:
(It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...)
Butz:
Ouch!
von Karma:
...Your sketch is in contempt of this court!
Butz:
H-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch!
von Karma:
You tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct?
Butz:
L-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, "viridian".
Edgeworth:
...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...?
Butz:
I know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it?
Judge:
Working in the fields...?
Edgeworth:
I presume he wanted to say "field work"... I hope.
Butz:
Th-That's it! Thanks, buddy!
Edgeworth:
(It's kind of sad that I was able to understand his mangled train wreck of a sentence...)
Butz:
I just happened to stop in here and found a wonderful new model!
von Karma:
...
Butz:
So see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, "crimson lake". ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch!
Judge:
Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch!
von Karma:
Stop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man!
Judge:
Refrain from whipping me, Ms. von Karma! Cross-whipping is as bad as cross-checking. Witness! That was all your fault! Testify, now!
Butz:
Waaaah... This is almost too much for me...!
Witness Testimony
-- What I Saw --
Butz:
I was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night.
I walked to the bridge a number of times, but...
I didn't see a s-snowmobile!
I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!
The girl I was waiting for didn't show up... My teacher died on me...
I'm all alone now. Aren't I, Edgeyyyyy...!?
Judge:
Witness! Please refrain from talking directly to the lawyers during your testimony!
Butz:
I-I'm just a nobody! Nothing but a small, worthless man, aren't I!? And why wasn't I asked for my name and occupation... or anything else...!?
Judge:
... Mr. Edgeworth. This man seems to have quite a severe inferiority complex.
Edgeworth:
...He's recently been the cause of numerous incidents. I think he's finally realized for himself... ...just how much of a nuisance he has been to other people!
Butz:
Yeah, that's right! I'm behind everything, every case! Watch out, OK! Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy!
Judge:
...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time.

Judge:
What ever is the matter, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
This one single statement is so full of contradictions... For a moment there, I thought I was going to collapse.
Judge:
Hmm...
von Karma:
So, witness? Any idea as to where these contradictions in your testimony lie? Depending on your answer... I may let my whip have its way.
Butz:
OK, give me a minute... Well, it was snowing that night so I couldn't possibly have seen the stars. That run-down shack is hardly a "lodge", is it...? And even if the stars could be seen, it isn't like I was there to look at them, right?
Edgeworth:
...
von Karma:
See? You can do it if you try.
Butz:
Heh heh heh... Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch!
von Karma:
...There is only one issue here. What you saw at Dusky Bridge.
Butz:
I walked to the bridge a number of times, but...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
"A number of times"...? How many?
Butz:
Maybe... five times? I went once every twenty minutes.
Edgeworth:
Which means... ...you spent almost two hours at Heavenly Hall that night?
Butz:
You bet! Real love is about waiting with your heart in your hands!
Judge:
Love, you say...?
Edgeworth:
It was this man's intention to summon the defendant to the small shack. ...Using this blackmail letter.
Judge:
B-Blackmail...!?
Butz:
No, no! That was simply a product of overflowing love... A-Agh!
von Karma:
You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness!
Judge:
So... what did you see? I hope for your sake you saw a snowmobile... You huffy, puffy, loosey-goosey excuse for a whimpering whining wuss of a witness, eh!
Butz:
Um... well... You see...
Edgeworth:

Butz:
S-S-S-Snowmobile.
Edgeworth:
If you truly have nothing to hide... ...then why are you stammering like you just flew over a cuckoo's nest!?
Butz:
Sh-Shut up! W-W-What is this!? I don't know! Don't ask me!
Edgeworth:
(It seems that I'll need to start from a more obvious contradiction. I'm going to strike the blow that will finally get him to spill the beans!)
Butz:
I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You didn't meet anyone?
Butz:
That's right. Because I've got nothing to do with this! And I'm just here to buy some viridian paint, OK!? Come on, I expect to see those crimson lake faces! Now!

Edgeworth:
...Indeed.

Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Larry Butz..."
Edgeworth:
(It seems that he's going to claim to have nothing to do with this to the end. I don't want this guy to cost us any more time... I need to slice through his obvious contradictions and keep things moving along...)
Edgeworth:
Larry Butz... I can understand why you might want to throw your old life away. You're pretty pathetic, and you cause all sorts of trouble...
Butz:
I'm sorry...!
Edgeworth:
But... Having realized just how much of a nuisance you have been... ...that could be considered a step in the right direction.
Butz:
Edgey! Are you... trying to console me?
Judge:
It certainly doesn't sound that way to me.
Edgeworth:
However... I cannot forgive you for simply turning away from the incidents you create!
Butz:
Waaah... You're totally pinning this on me...
Edgeworth:
...Now then. Let us talk about the night of the murder. Sister Bikini, after seeing the murder take place, asked Phoenix Wright to report it. Thus, he headed for the public phone by the bridge... There, he happened across a certain nefarious individual! You, Larry Butz!
Butz:
... That's right. Me, in the flesh.
Judge:
Hmm... Listen carefully, witness. It doesn't matter if you change your name. So long as you remain pretty pathetic, you will continue to cause these incidents! That reality will not change!
Butz:
B-But...! What do you want me to do, then!?
Edgeworth:
Larry. What you need to change is your inner self. "What you saw that night"... Testify truthfully! That is all you can do for now.
Butz:
... Edgey... I... I think... I've finally woken up! ... Well. I guess I could still be sleeping... But anyway! I'll do it! I'll testify! ... Well. I'm not sure this'll go especially well...
Judge:
I'll ask again, then, witness. What did you see on the night of the murder?
Witness Testimony
-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --
Butz:
I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...
I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!
I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!
There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.
That's when I ran into Nick.
Judge:
Hmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you?
von Karma:
So... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire?
Butz:
It was like me after a three day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall.
von Karma:
W-What did you say!?
Edgeworth:
Oh, don't worry... nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold.
von Karma:
As always, hard to know if he should be called lucky or unlucky...
Judge:
Now, Mr. Edgeworth! Please commence your cross-examination.
Cross Examination

Butz:
I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
What did you do out there in the cold for an hour and a half?
Butz:
Well, if you really must know... I was busy being excited. I guess.
Judge:
Hmmmmm... "Excited"? Dare I even ask...?
Butz:
I set the meeting time as 10:00 PM, right? But I couldn't wait. And I thought she might come early, too.
Edgeworth:
...Well, it appears she didn't come at all, in the end.
von Karma:
Because they never arranged to meet in the first place, did they?
Butz:
Shut up! Don't go picking my fond memories apart! Anyway, I was getting a little worried. I thought maybe Iris had lost her way. So every twenty minutes or so, I went out to the bridge. But I didn't see anything particularly suspicious... I didn't have anything else to do, so I went back to the shack to wait for her.
Butz:
I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
This "light" was, of course...
Butz:
Lightning. Like... KERPOW! Like a slap from Naomi, honestly! A big bada-boom! Hagaaaaah!
von Karma:
...Or a little like that?
Butz:
Waaah! That's more like a punch from Miranda!
Judge:
Witness, did you actually see the lightning hit the bridge?
Butz:
Well, I was a bit startled by the flash of light, so...
Butz:
I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Seeing that, what did you do?
Butz:
What do you think!? I was burning up as well! From the fire in my heart!
von Karma:
And that's why you went to take a look at the bridge?
Butz:
Well. To be honest... It was freezing cold, so at first I thought, "Forget it. I'm not leaving my covers." But it had pretty much stopped snowing... So, I dunno, I changed my mind.
Judge:
Hmmmmmm. I'm not sure I care for the "forget it" attitude you had at first, witness.
Butz:
There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You said "right away"... But exactly how long after the strike was that?
Butz:
Hmm... The lightning fell, and then the bridge caught on fire... Maybe around five minutes? I mean. I suddenly thought, "Gotta go check this out!"
von Karma:
How far is this small shack you were in from the bridge?
Butz:
Hold on... Well, it had pretty much stopped snowing... I guess about a five-minute walk?
Edgeworth:
And how did Dusky Bridge look when you got there?
Butz:
Like I had recovered a piece of my childhood. I mean, not even the bonfires kids make during school camping trips can compare!
Edgeworth:
(...Well? Should I press him for a little more info?)
Not right now.
Edgeworth:
(I don't think we can expect any more relevant information... Probably best to turn to other leads.)
Judge:
...Witness. Please continue your testimony.
Leads back to cross-examination
Why didn't you call anyone?
Edgeworth:
...Larry. Let me ask you one thing.
Butz:
What is it, Edgey? What's with the serious face?
Edgeworth:
Why didn't you call anyone?
Butz:
Eh? What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
Normally... when faced with a "towering inferno", one would try and tell someone. There is a public phone right by Dusky Bridge, correct?
Butz:
... Well, of course I thought of doing that.
Judge:
So then... let's hear why you didn't!
Butz:
H-Huh? Yeah, OK. A reason... My reason... It isn't that I didn't try to tell anyone... I just didn't have time to, OK?
Changes statement from "That's when I ran into Nick." to "I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later."
Why did you go to the bridge?
Edgeworth:
So you suddenly thought to "check out" the bridge...? Does this mean that you initially had no intention of doing so?
Butz:
W-Well... Yeah, I guess it does... It was really cold... I didn't really want to go out there.
Edgeworth:
If that's the case... Why did you change your mind? I would like to hear your reasoning.
Judge:
In which case... please give testimony to that effect, witness!
Butz:
M-My reasoning... OK... Reasoning, is it...?
Changes statement from "That's when I ran into Nick." to "I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!"
Butz:
That's when I ran into Nick.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
How did Phoenix Wright look when you met him?
Butz:
Hmm... He looked like a beaten up mule. He was dead tired. I mean, he had run all the way from Hazakura Temple. He simply stood, staring at me, breathing hard for a moment.
von Karma:
How far is it to Hazakura Temple from the bridge?
Butz:
On his legs... a 15 minute run, I'd say.
Judge:
...And that's when the murder was reported?
Butz:
That's right! And then he took a fall from the bridge!
Butz:
I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You claim to have arrived at the bridge at the same time as Wright?
Butz:
Y-Yeah! I thought, "I'd better tell someone about this." But then Nick came up yelling about murder! It totally made me forget about the bridge. The fire was pretty much out by then, anyway.
Edgeworth:
(What's this feeling...? I suddenly have a terrible case of unease...!)
von Karma:
It was after contacting the police that Phoenix Wright fell from the bridge, correct?
Butz:
Yeah. That's pretty much it. More or less.
Present Weather Data
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not..."
Butz:
I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
...So you decided to go and see what was happening?
Butz:
That's right! We're talking about a massive suspension bridge burning to high heaven! That's not something you see every day. A real spec... specule... ... Like, really special?
Edgeworth:
(Can we really trust a witness who is unable to pronounce "spectacle"?)
Judge:
Life seems to love hitting this poor witness below the belt...
Butz:
Well, my motto is to "hit life back as hard as I can." A-Agah!
von Karma:
...I'll give you a few hits too, if you'd like. With my whip.
Edgeworth:
(...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.)
Edgeworth:
Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...
Butz:
What the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien!
Edgeworth:
But your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is time.
Butz:
I've never been the best timekeeper, you know. "Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?" Terrible at those.
Edgeworth:
...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct?
Butz:
Yeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less.
Edgeworth:
...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at 10:45 PM. You say it takes less than five minutes from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around 11 PM.
Butz:
...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act.
Edgeworth:
That is impossible.
von Karma:
...What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
11 PM is when the murder occurred in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the courtyard. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time!
von Karma:
...!
Butz:
Ah! Excuse me! I-I have an objection!
Judge:
You do?
Butz:
Edgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah!
von Karma:
...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, "around 11". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that!
Edgeworth:
...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM!
von Karma:
And why not!?
Edgeworth:
It is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took around 30 minutes for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least 11:15 PM!
Judge:
Which means... what, exactly?
Edgeworth:
Wright did not see the bridge as it was burning that night. He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down! ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at 11 PM. Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15... Are you still trying to hide something from us!? What happened during these missing 15 minutes!?
Butz:
Urk... I... I feel like I just woke up... I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh!
von Karma:
...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem!
Butz:
Yeah! Not much of a problem at all!
Edgeworth:
Really...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident?
Judge:
Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?
Edgeworth:
That is the problem here... Even after the bridge burnt out, he was still there! He simply stood there and didn't report anything.
von Karma:
Th-That's what it sounds like...
Edgeworth:
This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid. There has to be a reason for his inaction!
Butz:
... Edgey... I think it's about time I got serious with you, dude.
Edgeworth:
...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time.
Butz:
Listen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!?
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes...
Butz:
I may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah!
von Karma:
...Then say it!
Judge:
Very well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!?

...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up.
Judge:
Hmmmmm... I suppose artists can be strange folk...
Butz:
That's right! I'm willing to sacrifice everything in order to draw the perfect sketch!
Edgeworth:
(...Including the truth, from the sound of it!)
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts?
Edgeworth:
Not at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains.
Judge:
And what would that be?
Edgeworth:
This is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him!
Butz:
Hah ha ha! You'll regret this, Edgey!

von Karma:
...Enough. Just take that ridiculous sketch of yours out already, witness!
Butz:

Judge:
That does indeed appear to be the fastest solution. ...I'll leave it to you, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(What should I do...? I've got a terrible feeling that the instant this sketch is revealed... ...the entire world may be changed by what is depicted there...!)
Leave it alone
Edgeworth:
...I cannot recommend looking at the sketch. His "works of art" are a force of nature best measured on the Richter scale.
Butz:
That's right! They'll shake your heart to pieces!

OK... But steel yourselves! This... is the world of Laurice Deauxnim!
Judge:
... Ah. Um... Well... So this... this is Dusky Bridge, correct? Q-Quite a large bridge, isn't it? Your response, Ms. von Karma?
von Karma:
Y-Yes, well... I-It's a better drawing than I expected.
Butz:
Isn't it? Isn't it? I struggled to reproduce those flames. I really did!
Judge:
...Yes, I'm sure you did. ...
von Karma:
......
Butz:
......
Edgeworth:
(Nngh... This is going to get ugly... No one has the bravery to bring it up, it seems... This... mysterious flying object...) ...Larry.
Butz:
What?
Edgeworth:
The burning bridge is fine. But... What is that unfortunate looking figure...?
Butz:
Ah. You spotted that? I thought you might.
Edgeworth:
However much I might want to ignore it... I can't.
Butz:
It's Iris, of course! Iris! I wish she'd take better care of herself. We have to plan for our future, you know! What would've happened to her if she had injured herself flying like that...?
Edgeworth:
... Larry, please. Answer this next question honestly.
Butz:
OK.
Edgeworth:
Are you REALLY claiming to have seen this? Are you claiming to have seen the silhouette of the defendant... ...flying over a bridge that was engulfed in flames...?
Butz:
Yep. That's what I saw. That's why I drew it! I'm an artist! A real artist!
Edgeworth:
Are...!
von Karma:
You...!
Judge:
High! The girl... She's really high up in this picture!
Judge:
Uwaaah! What was that for!?
von Karma:
...This is all a bad dream. I was hitting you on the cheek to test that theory!
Judge:
Please whip your own cheek from now on if you wish to test your wild theories! A-Anyway! No court of law will ever acknowledge... ...that p-p-people can f-f-fly!
von Karma:
...Actually, there is some precedent for this.
Butz:
She was flying pretty high, my sweet Iris. She was about 30 feet above the bridge, at least! It was really something to see!
Judge:
Th-This has to be some kind of m-m-mistake! ...Mr. Edgeworth, please bring the witness back down to earth!
Edgeworth:
What? Me...!?
Judge:
This witness is your friend, is he not?
von Karma:
"Accessory to foolishness..." ...Miles Edgeworth.
Judge:
Let us get back to the cross-examination! By force, if necessary! Mr. Edgeworth, I expect you to expose the obvious contradiction here!
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes, Your Honor... (Looks like I've got another reason to remember this moron...)
Butz:
...Well, what did you think of my debut piece?
Judge:
Get that thing away from me!
Larry's Sketch added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Now, hurry up and cross-examine him!
Adds statement "I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!"
Press (after adding statement "I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!")
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
...Could the reason you were so excited be...?
Butz:
What do you think!? My girlfriend was flying through the sky! Almost 30 feet above the bridge! I felt like I might start flying myself.
Edgeworth:
(If only you'd be so kind as to fly out of all of our lives...!)
Butz:
Anyway! I completely lost myself when I was drawing this scene!
Butz:
I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Just where did you see this sight from!?
Butz:
Hey! No need to shout... When I was lying in bed in that run-down shack... The crack of the lightning bolt made me realize that the bridge was burning. I just watched it for a while from there, thinking how nicely it was burning! Then after about five minutes, I saw it.
von Karma:
The defendant "flying"...?
Butz:
That's right! That's when I decided to go to the bridge!
Judge:
...I see. That all makes sense. Aside from the sketch itself...
Edgeworth:
(Yes... This sketch doesn't make any sense... I just need to convince the artist that his work is ludicrous.)
Present Iris's Hood
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Larry. What did you really see that night...?"
Butz:
The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The burning bridge moved you that much, did it? ...I find that hard to believe.
Butz:
You moron, Edgey! You don't understand me at all! If I see an abandoned cat, I find myself passing by it with tears in my eyes! I am a man overflowing with irresponsible kindness! And I use my irresponsible kindness to fill the pages of my notebook!
von Karma:
An artist, using a notebook... It's so pathetic, it makes me want to cry myself. I command you to go buy at least a proper sketch pad!
Butz:
W-W-What has that got to do with anything!?
Judge:
I'm not sure if I care for an artist using a notebook for sketching. Proceed, witness.
Butz:
...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You forgot the passage of time to that extent, did you?
Butz:
Well... Once I get caught up in something, I tend to forget everything else...
Edgeworth:
(That's true... He's always  been that way. I guess he's not lying about that, at least.)
von Karma:
Phoenix Wright appeared on the scene after 11:15... If he was drawing until then, that dispels all doubts.
Judge:
Aside from doubts of his humanity, eh...
Edgeworth:
(There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!)
Edgeworth:
Larry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care.
Butz:
In your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth!
Edgeworth:
If that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain.
Judge:
What might that be...?
Edgeworth:
That the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris!
Butz:
W-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh!
von Karma:
A foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim?
Edgeworth:
...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct?
Butz:
Of course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah!
von Karma:
It seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench.
Edgeworth:
...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!?
Butz:
W-What are you talking about!?
Edgeworth:
...I think you understand what I mean just fine.
Butz:
Why...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!?
Edgeworth:
Eh...?
Butz:
Edgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog!
Judge:
I do believe... ...that this unbelievably mysterious sketch... ...is destined to disappear, discredited and discarded. Straight into the garbage.
Butz:
...Hah... Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hagaaah!
von Karma:
...What is it now, witness?
Butz:
It feels like... I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you!
Edgeworth:
W-What...!?
Judge:
What is the meaning of your outburst, witness!?
Butz:
...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence.
Edgeworth:
"Definitive"...?
von Karma:
"Evidence"...?
Butz:
Iris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it!
Judge:
I didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality!
Butz:
...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain!
Edgeworth:
(...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.)
Witness Testimony
-- Proof That Iris Flew! --
Butz:
When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone...
I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her!
That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow!
I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood.
After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night.
Judge:
A c-crystal sphere...!?
Butz:
This one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers!
von Karma:
That sphere... Where did you find it?
Butz:
Let me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right.
Edgeworth:
And it was half-buried in the snow...?
Butz:
It had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge.
Judge:
Hmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere!
Butz:
...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward!
Judge:
There's something on it, isn't there...
von Karma:
...?
Judge:
Oh my... It's a blood stain!
Edgeworth:
(What!? A blood stain...!?)
Crystal Sphere added to the Court Record.
Butz:
You ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me "Master Larry"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore!
Edgeworth:
(...Didn't you want to be called "Laurice Deauxnim" only a few minutes ago!?)
Cross Examination
-- Proof That Iris Flew! --
Butz:
When I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
...So, you went to the burning bridge?
Butz:
That's right! To meet Iris! She actually flew to get to me! The least I could do was meet her halfway!
Judge:
But... the defendant was not at the bridge when you got there, you say?
Butz:
I guess she went back to Hazakura Temple. She's a girl, after all. She must have wanted to look her best.
Edgeworth:
(It must be lovely to live in the fantasyland of Larry's mind... Actually, it's so depressing that I can't even work up the energy to point...)
Judge:
So... what did you do next?
Butz:
I was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you searched all over for her?
Butz:
She was flying pretty high, you know. I thought maybe she slipped on her landing and got hurt. Hey! It was more than possible! Also, when I headed out to the shack the first time, I was snacking on a banana. I was pretty sure I threw the peel away somewhere around there, so, you know...
Edgeworth:
... (Can one guy really be this stupid?) So, did you find any signs of her so-called "landing"?
Butz:
Hmm... I don't really remember. I kept on falling over myself, and kinda lost it for a while there.
Judge:
You... fell over yourself?
Butz:
Yeah. The snow was deep, and there was even a banana peel out there!
Edgeworth:
... (Yup. There's stupid, and then there's Larry Butz.)
Judge:
The short of it is that you didn't find any signs of her "landing", correct? Then what happened next?
Butz:
That led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
"Half-buried"...?
Butz:
It was sitting in the snow, with a little gathered on top of it. It was very hard to spot, actually. I mean, it was dark out, too.
Judge:
I'm impressed... You did well to find it!
Butz:
No matter what you may think when you look at me, I'm a pro. A genius security guard. I used a penlight I "borrowed" from my company to help in my search... And it sparkled really brightly, as if it was saying, "Here I am!" to me.
Edgeworth:
It does indeed look very much like the crystal sphere on Iris's hood... But need I remind you that she was not wearing her hood that night?

I'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood.

Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Each nun is assigned their own hood! And they are assigned only one!
Butz:
I don't know anything about that, OK! And Iris is special, alright dude!? Even if she did steal a spare hood... I'll forgive her!
Edgeworth:
(This is getting us nowhere... Our destination for the day, it seems.)
Judge:
However... this crystal sphere was found near the bridge. That is a fact. If it didn't come from a hood, where could it have come from?
Edgeworth:
(That is the question I aim to answer.)
Present Victim's Staff, Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile

Butz:
After all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night.

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Let me confirm this one last time, Larry. The reasons you thought that this was "Iris"... ...are the hood and this crystal sphere, correct?
Butz:
That's right! My gut is never wrong! I met that old Bikini the next morning... And her crystal sphere was still there, safe and sound!
Judge:
Indeed... She was wearing it in this very room, earlier today.

"...Larry."
Edgeworth:
(This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!)
Edgeworth:
...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere.
Butz:
Th-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot!
von Karma:
The victim...!?
Edgeworth:
I have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere.
Butz:
H-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch!
von Karma:
...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach.
Edgeworth:
(They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime!
Judge:
...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone!
Butz:
W-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!?
Judge:
J-Just what does this mean!?
Edgeworth:
If anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the "landing site" was not hers either!
Judge:
T-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
A fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this "sketch", which I prefer to call a scribble, is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected!
Butz:
Y-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz!
von Karma:
...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring!
Edgeworth:
You honestly believe that...?
von Karma:
Give it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns!
Butz:
Why are you pointing at me!?
Edgeworth:
The victim's crystal sphere was found, near the bridge, on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
That crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder.
Judge:
After the murder?
von Karma:
There is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!
Butz:
... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh!
von Karma:
Enough joking... Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case!
Edgeworth:
(She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!)
Judge:
Your response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time!
von Karma:
Prepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?)
Yes, I can.
Edgeworth:
("Can I prove it...?" That isn't the issue. To simply "prove it". That's the only option! That's what he'd do... That's the way Phoenix Wright would do this!)
Leads to:
"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you."
No, it is impossible.
Edgeworth:
(No matter how I look at it, it's not possible... It is certainly strange that the crystal sphere was found near the bridge. But perhaps it is just a curve ball from the killer.)
von Karma:
Well, well... Miles Edgeworth seems to have nothing further to say.
Judge:
Hmmmmmm... Then I am left with no choice. The court sees no reason...
Hold it!
Butz:
What is this!? Hey, Edgey! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? If it was Nick standing where you are right now...
Edgeworth:
...!
Butz:
If it was Nick, do you think he'd give up!? No! He'd find the truth, no matter what it took! No matter how crazy it seemed!
Edgeworth:
... (Wright... At this moment, I'm standing where you should be. Which means there's only one thing to do! Think like you!)
Leads to:
"...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you."
Edgeworth:
...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case!
Judge:
You will do what!?
von Karma:
That look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered.
Edgeworth:
That should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!)
Judge:
I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder!
Present Crime Photo or Crystal Sphere
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Judge:
...Your response, Ms. von Karma?
von Karma:
Birds of a feather flock together... Are you familiar with this phrase? Miles Edgeworth! I think one such bird is calling for its fellow now!
Butz:
Go, go, Edgey! Do it! Prove it! Win! Win! Win!
Edgeworth:
(His cheering... It's as though I'm listening to the ominous caws of ravens!)
Judge:
...So, Mr. Edgeworth. What will you do from here?
Edgeworth:
O-One more chance, Your Honor. I can't turn back after coming all this way. (The time of the murder and when the crystal sphere was dropped... I need to find proof that the latter happened first!)
Leads back to:
"I order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth!"
Edgeworth:
This crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?
Butz:
That's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it!
Edgeworth:
...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear.
Judge:
W-What...?
Edgeworth:
When the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly...
von Karma:
Snowing...?
Edgeworth:
On the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body.
Judge:
Ah...!
Edgeworth:
...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder!
von Karma:
Wha... Whaaaaat!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Edgeworth:
On the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!
Judge:
What... What could that have been!?
Edgeworth:
This sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there?
von Karma:
...!
Edgeworth:
Allow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
The murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness!
Edgeworth:
Just who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma?
von Karma:
Have you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body.
von Karma:
Th-That's the same thing!
Edgeworth:
...No, it isn't!
von Karma:
!
Edgeworth:
...You said it yourself.
von Karma:
Very little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed.
Edgeworth:
If that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
You are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!?
Edgeworth:
(I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!)
Judge:
Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple!
Present Tracks Photo
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"On that snowy night..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
(No... That isn't it... I'm on the wrong track here. I need to charge on through this... Even if it makes things look bad for my client...!)
Judge:
...Try again, Mr. Edgeworth. And this time, without the scary glare, if you don't mind!
Leads back to:
"Now, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation."
Edgeworth:
On that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile.
von Karma:
Ah...!
Edgeworth:
As we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah!
von Karma:
This... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave!
Edgeworth:
What do you mean!?
von Karma:
The only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...?
Edgeworth:
Heh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation!
von Karma:
W-What!?
Edgeworth:
...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean?
von Karma:
Do you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point.
Butz:
Ed-Edgey! Thank you...!
Judge:
...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances.
von Karma:
Grrr... Grrrrrr!
Edgeworth:
(Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner.
von Karma:
Excuse me...?
Edgeworth:
There was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright!
Butz:
R-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch!
von Karma:
Miles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel!
Edgeworth:
A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.
Butz:
What a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy!
von Karma:
...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for!
Butz:
Ouuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch!
von Karma:
I demand satisfaction!
Judge:
...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution.
Edgeworth:
(And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...)
von Karma:
...
Judge:
Court is now adjourned!
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!?
Judge:
I don't think there is a problem with it.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... You say that with such gusto that I suppose I must agree that is all there is to it.
Judge:
... Don't get smart with me! Get smart with this penalty!
Edgeworth:
(It would appear that even I can make mistakes...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't accept that.
Edgeworth:
Well done, Your Honor.
Judge:
W-What?
Edgeworth:
I was only testing you just now.
Judge:
... Well then, why don't you try testing this penalty, too!?
Edgeworth:
(It looks like I shouldn't have spoken in haste...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That statement contradicts the data provided by this piece of evidence!
Judge:
It does? How do you mean?
Edgeworth:
Forgive me, Your Honor, but you yourself just said that it does!
Judge:
... Don't try to play mind games with me!
Edgeworth:
(Curses... It appears I have yet to adjust to being on this side of the courtroom.)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
