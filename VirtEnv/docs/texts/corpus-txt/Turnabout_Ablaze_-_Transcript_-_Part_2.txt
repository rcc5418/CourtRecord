Edgeworth:
So now we know who the Yatagarasu really was. And yet, there remains much to this case that needs to be resolved.
Franziska:
Like how the weapons crossed country lines, for example. The two countries have incredibly strict security systems and entry procedures. Short of a miracle, it's impossible for someone to have smuggled them in.
Edgeworth:
Smuggling them in, huh...? (We will need to open a new line of investigation on just this aspect alone... But before we do, I would like to go through my evidence once more.)
Unnecessary evidence has been removed. Remaining evidence has been re-arranged.
Gumshoe:
Hey! There's a VCR here, sir! Now we can see what's on that tape Detective Badd gave us!
Edgeworth:
(This piece of evidence from the KG-8 Incident, hidden from sight for ten long years... I just know that this is related to the current case somehow.) Detective Gumshoe, if you could please play the tape for us.
Gumshoe:
Sure thing, sir!
Edgeworth:
This man! It's Manny Coachen!
Kay:
A-And he's holding a knife in his hand!
Franziska:
This looks like footage from a security camera at the entrance of an apartment building.
Edgeworth:
An apartment building? How do you figure that?
Franziska:
Unlike you, I actually read the summary file on the KG-8 Incident. And the crime scene was the victim's own apartment.
Edgeworth:
(So this footage was shot at the entrance to the victim's own apartment building...?)
Franziska:
At the trial, Mr. Faraday claimed that the piece of footage existed.
Edgeworth:
However, no one could find it.
Franziska:
Yes. Somehow, someone was able to steal it and hide it through Mr. Ernest Amano.
Edgeworth:
I can see how this would've been a definitive piece, and why someone would want to hide it.
Gumshoe:
But it's a piece of evidence from a ten-year-old case. There's no way it's related to this case we're working on now, sir!
Edgeworth:
Actually, I believe it has everything to do with the case we're working on now. The ringleader even went so far as to use Mr. Portsman to retrieve it. Which means that in this video lies a very inconvenient bit of footage to the ringleader.
Gumshoe:
Where!? Where!?
Edgeworth:
Nngh. Wait. What was that!?
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
That bit you played just now... Please show it to me again! This car! This is something we cannot overlook.
Gumshoe:
Why's that, sir?
Edgeworth:
Look here, Detective Gumshoe.
Present flag
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is the national flag of the Principality of Cohdopia."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Don't you find this section... to be particularly of interest?
Gumshoe:
I don't see anything at all... Oho! A-Are you talking about that thing, sir!? I've heard that you can capture ghosts on film. Is that what it is, sir!? So wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-where is it in this picture, sir!?
Edgeworth:
...That's quite enough. (How could he have mistaken this for an apparition?)
Kay:
Oh, wow! It looks like you can be wrong sometimes, too, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(H-How mortifying to have her point that out in front of everyone...! It shouldn't be that hard. I just need to calm down and think clearly about this. This blade can really only be paired up with that piece of evidence!)
Leads back to:
"Look here, Detective Gumshoe."
Edgeworth:
This is the national flag of the Principality of Cohdopia. And because it has the national flag on it, we know this to be an official government car. But the question we should be asking ourselves is what was a government car doing there?
Alba:
Ah, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth. So you were here all this time.
Franziska:
Ambassador Alba...
Alba:
Thank you very much for continuing the investigation, even at the time of night. Ah, if only I was even a tiny bit more careful... ...this tragedy would never have happened. I am truly sorry.
Edgeworth:
This wasn't your fault, sir. This had nothing to do with how careful you were.
Alba:
You idiot, Quercus! You couldn't chase after a simple thief! Now then, let's get down to the real reason why I came looking for the two of you. I would like you to put the investigation on hold for a while. Can you do that?
Franziska:
Excuse me!?
Alba:
I heard you've apprehended the thief that turned this embassy upside-down. And we are in the middle of an event celebrating our countries' reconciliation. We can't exactly have the police and detectives walking around here forever. You're scaring the visitors away. So I hope that you can understand how I feel.
Edgeworth:
Nngh... But we must finish our investigation and resolve the remaining issues.
Alba:
Why don't we leave the rest to the Allebahstian and Babahlese police?
Franziska:
Ambassador! We are so close! Just a little more and...!
Alba:
Ms. von Karma. I'm afraid I've made up my mind. And without my permission, you can't proceed with your investigation, anyway, right?
Franziska:
That's true, however...
Edgeworth:
(As he said at the very beginning... ...this area can be considered to be Allebahstian soil. In which case, we are nothing but foreigners in their land. Is this really where our investigation ends!?)
Hold it!
MIB:
Shifu! We found Mr. Edgeworth, sir!
Officer:
Shifu! This way!
Lang:
Yo!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... You're back on the scene rather quickly.
Lang:
If I laid back and took a break, I'd lose the scent of my prey, Mr. Prosecutor.
Alba:
Agent Lang! Why in the... Why have you returned?
Lang:
Because I have to solve this case, no matter what.
Alba:
Well, I'm sorry to inform you... Ah, and don't take this the wrong way; I don't suspect you personally... ...however, a member of Interpol was just found to be a thief, and so...
Lang:
Grr...
Alba:
Under these circumstances, I wish to put your investigation on hold. After all, I believe our own police can handle things from here. They are quite capable.
Lang:
..................
Edgeworth:
(Arngh...! At this rate, our investigation really WILL come to a close!)
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Heh...... heh heh heh heh heh......... Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ambassador Alba, I get it now. I really do...
Alba:
Oh? I'm very glad you understand how I feel.
Lang:
No, not that. What I was talking about was... ...I know who the killer is behind tonight's murder!
Edgeworth:
Y-You--
Kay:
K-Know--
Gumshoe:
T-The--
Franziska:
K-Killer!?
Alba:
D-Do you really mean that, Agent Lang?
Lang:
Heh, wolves don't lie.
Alba:
Th-Then who is it!?
Lang:
Well, let me first say that I'm not talking about Mr. Coachen's murder. That was all Shih-na.
Edgeworth:
!
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "The truth lies not at the exit, but rather, shines outside the maze itself." The truth is unexpectedly simple. So let me ask you this: who do you think was DeMasque II's killer? Hmph, I'll tell you who... It was you, Franziska von Karma!
Franziska:
I was the killer!?
Kay:
Hey, wait! But that's impossible!
Gumshoe:
Y-Yeah! ...Although, that whip is actually quite... Yeowwww!
Franziska:
Hold your tongue, and that ludicrous remark you were about to make!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... Are you seriously accusing her of murder?
Lang:
.........Yeah, I am.
Edgeworth:
(He doesn't appear to be joking.)
Lang:
Hey, sis... I remember that just before Ambassador Alba went to give his speech... ...he called you into his office, right?
Franziska:
Y-Yes, he did... but what does that have to do with anything!?
Lang:
I'm getting to that. Furthermore, in order to solve both cases... ...you moved around rather freely between Allebahst and Babahl, did you not?
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
And where is your evidence that I am the killer!?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hmph... I was just getting to that. Trust me, I'll show them to you in due time. Ambassador Alba. In order for me to bring this case to a close... ...I'll need to inspect your office one more time. Will you grant me permission?
Alba:
.................. .........With things as they are, I suppose I don't have much of a choice, do I...?
Lang:
Good! Then let's move out! Oh, and don't even think about running away, sis. My pack will be keeping a close eye on you, you can bet your bottom dollar on that!
Franziska:
Hmph! As if I would have any reason to flee! But just so we're clear, your logic had better be sound... ...because I'll accept nothing short of a perfect explanation!
Edgeworth:
(She seems rather upset, not that I blame her...)
Lang:
Haaa ha ha ha ha ha hahaha. I expected that you'd accept no less. But we'll see how long you can keep that nose of yours stuck up in the air like that.
Franziska:
Arngh...!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... As someone related to tonight's case, I request that you allow me to take part. And so that I may clean up my superior's mess.
Franziska:
!
Lang:
Hmph... I guess I should. The more the merrier, especially when it's the peanut gallery.
Kay:
Oh! In that case, I want to join in, too! I still haven't seen what it looks like in Allebahst, yet!
Gumshoe:
If you let Kay in, then you've gotta let me in, too, pal! I can't sit around and do nothing when Ms. von Karma's in trouble!
Kay:
Hey, Gummy! Let's have a competition to see who can save her first, OK!?
Gumshoe:
OK! I'll take you up on that! Oh, yeah! I'm fired up and raring to go!
Edgeworth:
(...As a detective, I don't believe this is something you're supposed to be excited over.)
Lang:
Haaa ha ha ha ha ha hahaha. Sounds like this is going to got real interesting! Ambassador Alba... I'll be bringing these kids along for the ride.
Alba:
...Very well. But I'd like you to keep in mind that this will be your last chance.
Lang:
Hmph. I'll have this whole mess cleaned up before you know it. Now, let's go!
March 15, 12:53 AMAllebahstian EmbassyAmbassador's Office
Lang:
OK, now, let's first go over the facts one more time. Manny Coachen's body was found over in the secretariat's office in Babahl. The weapon that took his life was one of Allebahst's ornamental knives. And then, the body of DeMasque II, Mr. Ka-Shi Nou... ...was found here in the Allebahstian ambassador's office. Through our investigation, we found that the murder weapon was this Primidux Statue. And that this is actually Babahl's statue. This case... no matter how I look at it... Sis! If it wasn't you, then there's no one else who could have pulled this off!
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Agent Lang! Do you understand the full implications of what you are saying!?
Lang:
Of course I do, sis. And I'm serious. You were on the trail of the smuggling ring, and you wanted any evidence you could find. And so, while people were distracted by the Yatagarasu's appearance, you snuck in here. That's when you two ran into each other. You and that other thief who took advantage of the confusion from the fire!
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Even if all that were true, how do you explain the movement of the weapons!?
Lang:
Hmph... Don't worry. I plan to show that you're the culprit behind that, too. You had permission to investigate both embassies at will. With that kind of free reign, you could've easily taken the weapons across country lines. Hey now! Look, sis. I thought I already told you, I'm not messing around here.
Franziska:
Arngh!
Lang:
This case isn't directly tied to the smuggling ring... ...but Shih-na certainly is tied to the smuggling ring!
Edgeworth:
(He is right in saying that she is a member of the smuggling ring... ...however, the connection between this case and the ring... Could it not be deeper than what any of us can imagine?)
Franziska:
Grrr...! Let's get this ridiculous circus over with already!
Edgeworth:
Franziska, you need to calm down. Because you only know the facts of the Allebahstian side of the case... ...I don't believe you can see the case as a whole, and therefore, solve it.
Franziska:
What!?
Edgeworth:
But don't worry. I am taking this seriously as well, and I will prove your innocence.
Lang:
That's the only way to be... Mr. Prosecutor! But can you come up with anything else that can top my hypothesis? Of course, your explanation has to solve the mystery of the moving weapons as well.
Edgeworth:
...Of course, and I will. Let us now delve into the truth behind the murder of DeMasque II.
Franziska:
You do understand, don't you, Miles Edgeworth? This isn't just a confrontation against Agent Lang. If you can't figure out how the murder of DeMasque II is related to the smuggling ring... ...then it will mean the end of our investigation.
Edgeworth:
(As long as I have no good counterargument to his hypothesis... ...then the best I can do is walk this thin tightrope and see what I can do!)
Lang:
Come on, Mr. Prosecutor. Let's get started!
Edgeworth:
Yes, let's.
-- Border-Crossing Weapons --
Lang:
One of Allebahst's knives was used in Babahl to murder Mr. Coachen.
And the murder weapon in the killing of DeMasque II is Babahl's Primidux Statue.
Somehow, these two objects were able to penetrate the two countries' impenetrable security.
The only one who traversed the two countries just before and after the crimes was you.
Edgeworth:
So as long as I can't explain how the weapons moved about, Franziska will remain a suspect?
Lang:
You got it, Mr. Prosecutor. So why don't you stop giving me a hard time. Under these circumstances, who the heck can carry a weapon across country lines!? I've worked through every possibility, but there's only one that's plausible. Your boss!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, what I've learned from you just now is that you've lost sight of yourself.
Lang:
Wh-What are you talking about!?
Edgeworth:
By focusing too intently on that which is in front of us, we become blind to the truth. Don't tell me Lang Zi never said anything to that effect?
Lang:
You prosecutor...! Who do you think you are, speaking about Lang Zi's proverbs like that!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I don't need his proverbs. Because MY words are all you will need to see the truth.
Rebuttal
-- Border-Crossing Weapons --
Lang:
One of Allebahst's knives was used in Babahl to murder Mr. Coachen.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I concur that this knife crossed over country lines.
Lang:
Good, but that's not the only thing that did. We mustn't forget about the other weapon! The knife was only one.
Lang:
And the murder weapon in the killing of DeMasque II is Babahl's Primidux Statue.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you're saying that the Primidux Statue was also brought over by Franziska?
Lang:
Like I told you before, that's the only way it makes sense!
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
And how exactly did she bring it over?
Lang:
I... haven't figured that out yet.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... That's rather weak statement, considering how sure you are.
Lang:
Maybe, but there is one thing I do know for sure.
Lang:
Somehow, these two objects were able to penetrate the two countries' impenetrable security.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
"Impenetrable"...? I should hardly think so.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
You've seen the top of the wall between the two countries, right? Who in the world could cross over that?
Kay:
Yeah, not even I could climb over that thing with all that barbed wire...
Lang:
The only way into either embassy is through the doors in the Theatrum Neutralis. So the only way for the knife and the Primidux Statue to traverse the two countries... ...is through those security camera-equipped, well-guarded doors.
Present Babahl's Primidux Statue or Allebahst's
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Agent Lang, those two items are not the only two to cross the border tonight."
Lang:
The only one who traversed the two countries just before and after the crimes was you.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Was Franziska really the only person to have traveled between the two countries?
Lang:
According to the guards at both doors, she is the only one to go back and forth. The sis there was in Allebahst when the Yatagarasu showed. And then, just before you guys found Mr. Coachen's body, she entered Babahl. I think we can assume that's when she brought the knife into Babahl.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Then how do you explain the Primidux Statue?
Lang:
...I haven't quite figured that out yet. However, the fact that the two weapons crossed the border... ...proves that the killer must have also traveled across the country lines!
Edgeworth:
(The only things to cross the border are the Primidux Statue and the knife? I should hardly think that those are the only two items, Agent Lang...!)
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, those two items are not the only two to cross the border tonight.
Lang:
Oh?
Edgeworth:
DeMasque II was killed by Babahl's Primidux Statue, yes. But if that's the case, then tell me, where did Allebahst's Primidux Statue go?
Lang:
To Babahl...!
Edgeworth:
Precisely. And if the two statues really were switched... ...then this means that both statues were smuggled across the border at some point. Which means that a total of three items were smuggled across the embassies!
Lang:
Hmm... I guess so. But you know what? It doesn't matter the number of items, only that the sis is the only one who could've done it! Because the only person who went back and forth between Allebahst and Babahl is her!
Edgeworth:
(Is that really true? Was there no one else who traveled between the two countries? Actually, there was definitely another person; one who paid a visit to both sides of the wall!)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...Is that really so, Agent Lang?
Lang:
Ha ha ha ha! What a lousy time to try and bluff your way out of this! I checked out what the guards said, along with the security cameras' footage. You're not going to overturn my hypothesis that easily!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But suppose there was some other way other than through the theater doors?
Lang:
What other way...?
Edgeworth:
(The other entity that managed to cross the border unharmed... If I point it out, it would open up a whole new possibility! And though I hesitate to bring this out... ...as long as this entity exists, the impossible road becomes a possibility.)
Lang:
It looks like you've got some clever idea in mind.
Edgeworth:
I do, and I can show it to you through a single piece of evidence.
Lang:
Tch! Fine, then. Let's see this piece of evidence that will show me this "other route"!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence will show us another way to move between the two countries!
Present Photo of Yatagarasu
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Agent Lang, I'm sure you familiar with this unforgettable photo."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
I believe this is the piece of evidence that will show you how!
Lang:
......... What about it? You're going to have to explain because I don't see another road or anything else!
Edgeworth:
B-But how can you not see!? Wolves are known for their keen eyesight!
Lang:
Sorry, but the only thing I see is the crud that you're hoping will stick to the wall.
Edgeworth:
(I need to think calmly about this and find that other road the smuggled goods look...)
Leads back to:
"This piece of evidence will show us another way to move between the two countries!"
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, I'm sure you familiar with this unforgettable photo.
Lang:
Tch...! That supernatural photo!? Like I said before... Humans can't fly.
Edgeworth:
No, of course not. I understand that perfectly well.
Lang:
And don't start claiming that Shih-na somehow grew wings, either.
Edgeworth:
I wouldn't dream of claiming that.
Lang:
And I won't allow you to take back what you've said either! I'll say it again; it's not humanly possible to fly through the air without wings! So you'd better have a good explanation for this, Mr. Prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
...Arngh! (But how can I prove who it was that flew through the air in this photo!? Wait. "Not humanly possible"...? Eureka...!) Very well. You will have your explanation!
Lang:
It sounds like you have a good idea simmering inside that head of yours... Let's hear it! The face hidden within this photo's blurry, trailed shadow is...!?
Present Allebahst's Primidux Statue
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Naturally, the shadow is the third smuggled object, the Primidux Statue replica."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is the face behind the shadow!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
I thought I said that you'd better have a GOOD explanation. I can't make heads or tails of what you're trying to say with that!
Edgeworth:
Nnrgh! (W-Was I wrong...?)
Lang:
Come on... Hurry up and show me what that shadow that's flying through the air is!
Edgeworth:
(I need to think calmly about this and find that other road the smuggled goods look...)
Leads back to:
"Let's hear it! The face hidden within this photo's blurry, trailed shadow is...!?"
Edgeworth:
Naturally, the shadow is the third smuggled object, the Primidux Statue replica.
Lang:
You can't be serious!
Edgeworth:
The Yatagarasu... or rather Calisto Yew dressed as Agent Shih-na, was inside Babahl. She dressed the replica statue up in clothes, and launched it through the air.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hah... Mr. Prosecutooooooor! You left out a very crucial bit in your explanation.
Edgeworth:
I know I did.
Lang:
She "launched it through the air"!? Hah... And how exactly did she do thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Edgeworth:
(He is literally baring his fangs at me...! But he has a point. How exactly did it move through the air like that? As long as this remains unsolved, we won't be able to move any closer to the truth! Which reminds me, didn't he say this earlier...?)
Lang:
Hey, sis... I remember that just before Ambassador Alba went to give his speech... ...he called you into his office, right?
Edgeworth:
(So, just before the murder, Franziska was called here, right into this very room. If that's the case... then that may be another avenue I can pursue.) Agent Lang. In order for me to answer that question... ...I will need to hear testimony from Ms. von Karma.
Franziska:
!
Lang:
Oh...? What are you up to now, pretty boy?
Edgeworth:
Earlier, you mentioned something of interest to me. You said that just before the murder occurred... ...Ms. von Karma had been in this room because Ambassador Alba had called for her. And for that reason alone, you believe her to be the killer.
Lang:
Yeah, I guess I did say something like that.
Edgeworth:
In that case, I believe it is my duty to ask her what her side of the story is.
Lang:
Hah! Do you really think a criminal would tell us the honest truth?
Franziska:
How dare you!? As I've said numerous times, there is absolutely no proof that I am the killer! Miles Edgeworth! Don't tell me you suspect me, too!?
Edgeworth:
I don't. However, I can't ignore the fact that you were in this room at one point in time. Which is why I would like to hear about your movements in this room.
Franziska:
Krngh!
Edgeworth:
Franziska... I feel that I still don't have enough information... ...which is why your testimony is incredibly important to the outcome of this case.
Franziska:
............ Alright. So? What would you like me to talk about?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I'd like you to please testify to your movements in this room until the murder occurred.
Lang:
Hmph... Alright, let's try this your way for a change. But if what she has to say turns out to be a waste of time... ...I'll place her under arrest faster than you can howl "Nooooooooooooo!"
Edgeworth:
Hmph... As you wish.
-- Movements in Allebahst --
Franziska:
As I said earlier, I was assigned to guard duty in the Allebahstian Embassy.
After I saw the Steel Samurai off on his way towards the ambassador's office...
...I returned to the rose garden for a bit, and checked up on the security situation.
After all the preparations were in place, I was called back by Ambassador Alba to his office.
Edgeworth:
Franziska, I want us to make this clear from the very beginning... ...so what I wish to confirm is that the only time span in which you were in this office... ...was before the murder occurred. Is that correct?
Franziska:
Yes, of course.
Edgeworth:
I see. (For now, the only way that I can see for us to break out of this situation... ...is to ask Franziska about her testimony in more detail.)
Rebuttal
-- Movements in Allebahst --
Franziska:
As I said earlier, I was assigned to guard duty in the Allebahstian Embassy.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I thought your duty was to fact-find anything you could about the smuggling ring?
Franziska:
Yes, that was my job. But upon hearing that the Yatagarasu had sent a calling card to the Embassy... ...Ambassador Alba called upon us to protect the Embassy instead. That incident seven years ago... Or have you forgotten what happened here back then?
Edgeworth:
Nngh... (Anything related to that case we were involved in appears to be rather painful for her. It's not exactly one I can readily forget myself...)
Franziska:
Hmph... It looks like you remember the case after all.
Edgeworth:
Of course I do.
Franziska:
I inspected every location, every possible escape route... ...and every aspect of the police security detail. I did all that, then after that...
Franziska:
After I saw the Steel Samurai off on his way towards the ambassador's office...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you were at the theater as well?
Franziska:
Yes, and I suppose you were also there as well, watching that stage show?
Edgeworth:
Well, yes. (So Franziska was there...)
Franziska:
Hmph... Well, after the show was over and I saw the Steel Samurai off...
Franziska:
...I returned to the rose garden for a bit, and checked up on the security situation.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Why did you need to confirm the degree of preparation for even the speech?
Franziska:
For security's sake, of course. What other reason could I have had? No one knew just how the Yatagarasu had planned on getting in, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Franziska:
And in the end, the Yatagarasu did choose to appear in the rose garden... Even if it did turn out to be nothing more than a shadow... Arngh... Who would've thought that she would use a shadow!?
Edgeworth:
Ack! C-Calm down, Franziska! (She must still be nursing a grudge over the fact that she couldn't figure it out herself.)
Franziska:
Hmph... Anyway, there was no one in the rose garden. And we were aware that the speech was set to start soon thereafter.
Franziska:
After all the preparations were in place, I was called back by Ambassador Alba to his office.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
At that time, DeMasque II's body had yet to be found in this room, is that correct?
Franziska:
That's right. But Ambassador Alba was here. One could hardly miss his rather large presence.
Edgeworth:
Hmm...
Lang:
Hmph! A criminal will say anything to get out of getting arrested! How do we know you're not lying!?
Franziska:
Well, if you need proof, I'd be happy to oblige you.
Lang:
Seriously!?
Franziska:
Like I keep telling you... ...when I arrived at this office, Ambassador Alba was already here. He was standing by the flower box on the windowsill, watering his plants.
Alba:
Ah, I can attest to that. I remember speaking with the lovely lady around that time here in my office.
Lang:
Grr! Alright, then... Add that statement to your testimony, and let's hear some details.
Edgeworth:
(So Ambassador Alba was in this room at the time, was he...?)
Add statement:
"When I arrived, Ambassador Alba was watering the flowers on the windowsill."
Franziska:
When I arrived, Ambassador Alba was watering the flowers on the windowsill.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
For the sake of being thorough, I'd like to ask you something. How did you know that Ambassador Alba was watering his plants at the windowsil?
Franziska:
What do you mean by that?
Edgeworth:
The entrance to this room is on this side, however, the window is on the opposite side. If what you say is true, then when you entered the room, his body would've been like a wall. He would've been blocking your view of what he was doing. Isn't that not correct?
Franziska:
I suppose it was a bit hard to see around him. But fortunately for me Ambassador Alba is not an immovable wall.
Edgeworth:
...?
Franziska:
I knocked before I entered, and as I did, he turned around to greet me... ...with a watering can in his hand. So it's only natural to believe that he was watering his plants, right?
Edgeworth:
I suppose.
Franziska:
After his greeting, we spent a little time talking about his flowers. He had obtained them himself, and is growing them with the utmost care, you know.
Alba:
Yes... The plants in this room... They are all like my children.
Franziska:
The passionflowers in the flower box on the windowsill are growing beautifully, too. All four of them are in full bloom.
Edgeworth:
! Ms. von Karma, what did you say just now?
Franziska:
I said that the flowers are growing beautifully. What about that statement do you not understand?
Edgeworth:
(What do I not understand? I do not understand why a certain thing is the way it is...) I'd like for you to append that statement to your testimony.
Franziska:
Very well.
Add statement:
"There were four large passionflowers in full bloom in the flower box."
Franziska:
There were four large passionflowers in full bloom in the flower box.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I'd like to confirm this with you one more time. There were four passionflowers in bloom in that box, correct?
Franziska:
Yes. I should hardly think I could have miscounted such eye-catching flowers.
Edgeworth:
(There must be a deeper meaning to this statement. And it appears that I must take a gamble on its meaning for me to make any progress!)
Present Passionflowers
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Franziska..."
Edgeworth:
(The Primidux Statues were already switched by the time the murder happened. In light of that fact, what Franziska saw in this room before the crime... ...is of incredible importance!)
Edgeworth:
Franziska... For some odd reason... your testimony contradicts with this piece of evidence.
Franziska:
It does appear that way.
Lang:
Hah! I know it! I knew we couldn't trust your words, sis!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! What are you doing discrediting Ms. von Karma like this!?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, sir! If you keep this up, she's gonna get taken away, sir! Eeek!
Franziska:
All I've done is state what I saw! I have made not a single mistake in my testimony! And for this... I am still under suspicion for murder. Is the number of flowers really all that important at this juncture, Miles?
Edgeworth:
At the very least, it is a contradiction in this enigmatic case. One that I find hard to dismiss as irrelevant.
Lang:
Hah! Then let's hear it, Mr. Prosecutor! What does the number of flowers have to do with anything? What does it prove?
Edgeworth:
I believe the answer to that will become clear if we were to examine that flower box. (How did this contradiction come about...? There must be something behind this discrepancy!)
Alba:
Th-They're my beloved flowers. I've grown them with the utmost care. So I ask that you please be gentle with them as you examine them, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I understand.
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Watering can
Edgeworth:
This watering can has a rather robust design.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Why are you telling us stuff we can clearly see for ourselves!? Plus, if you keep wasting time talking about that, Ms. von Karma's gonna get arrested!
Edgeworth:
Nngh... (I'd better examine something else.)
Flower box
Edgeworth:
This flower box... It appears to be made of marble.
Franziska:
It looks that way. But, so what? Is it something that's so important that you absolutely had to mention it?
Edgeworth:
N-No, not exactly, but...
Franziska:
.........Miles Edgeworth. You DO understand our current situation, don't you?
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes, of course. I am fully aware of the situation.
Franziska:
Oh? Then in that case, allow me to ask you once again. Is what the flower box is made out of really all that important?
Edgeworth:
Nngh... (It would appear that the construction of the flower box is not that important.)
Passionflowers
Edgeworth:
The name of these flowers... I believe they're called "passionflowers". Despite being called "flowers", they are actually a species of vine. They appear to be growing well, and are well-supported by these plant supports.
Lang:
Yeah, but no matter how I look at it, it looks like there are only two here to me! You realize, don't you, sis... Your little lie has failed you!
Franziska:
Arngh! Miles Edgeworth! Hurry up and shut this man up for me already!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... (I suppose I will need to use some evidence to "shut him up", won't I...?)
Show evidence
Leads to:
"Hmph... I believe I have just the piece of evidence you require."
Don't have evidence to show
Edgeworth:
(Not yet... I still have a thing or two left to examine.)
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I believe I have just the piece of evidence you require.
Lang:
Oh? You do, do you!? You have such confidence in the face of your current plight... ...but I highly doubt it'll last until the end!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... You howl like a wolf, Agent Lang... ...but we'll see if you have any bite to back up that bark after you see the evidence! The truth the passionflowers reveal can be seen in this piece of evidence!
Present Hair Sticks
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Shih-na, who was supposedly in Babahl the entire time, had these "hair sticks" on her..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Well? What do you think now, Agent Lang?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hah! You may talk big... but as usual, it's nothing more than a big bluff!
Edgeworth:
Gnrk! (Was I wrong!? Perhaps I should gather a bit more information before I attempt this again...)
Soil hole
Edgeworth:
(Hm...? This patch of soil looks as though it has had something removed from it.)
Lang:
Heh! What are you doing, Mr. Prosecutor? Why'd you clam up all of a sudden? I'm still here, waiting for an explanation, you know!
Edgeworth:
Did you know, Agent Lang? Flowers are best appreciated in silence.
Lang:
...Tch.
Edgeworth:
(It looks like two things were pulled out of this flower box...)
Edgeworth:
Shih-na, who was supposedly in Babahl the entire time, had these "hair sticks" on her... ...that look exactly like the plant supports in this flower box. In other words, I believe it can be said that these "hair sticks" are in actuality... ...support sticks for the passionflowers!
Lang:
Heh! And so what!? Is this really all that important to the case?
Examine evidence
Ring on Hair Sticks
Edgeworth:
Aha... So this ring-like section... ...is there to support vines like passionflowers up, huh? But if that's all they were meant to do, then what is this notch on the top end?
Kay:
Maybe it's for string or something to run through? To help the stick stay upright?
Edgeworth:
A notch for string to run through, huh?
Tip of Hair Sticks
Edgeworth:
I suppose this dirt was from when this plant support was stuck in the flower box.
Kay:
I guess that's why only the tip is dirty, huh?
Edgeworth:
Yes.
Edgeworth:
Of course it is. It means that we've found yet another item that was smuggled between the countries tonight.
Lang:
Aiya!
Edgeworth:
Think about it logically, Agent Lang. These sticks were originally in Allebahst... ...but somehow, they wound up in Shih-na's hands, who was in Babahl the whole night. So make no mistake! These sticks were smuggled somehow, just like the knife and statue!
Lang:
Arngh! Hmph! Very well, then! I want to hear from you exactly how they wound up in Babahl!
Edgeworth:
(How did these support sticks find their way to Babahl and why? There must be some reason as to why they ended up there... Aha! So that's why!) Agent Lang, if you would please take a look at this and tell me its shape.
Lang:
Hmph! It's just another stick, isn't it!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... And so it is. But the shape of the support sticks is what is important. For when they are used with something in this room, that's when it all comes into focus. And the object that completes the picture when used with the support sticks is...!
Present crossbow
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"Th-That's a crossbow... Wait! You're not really suggesting...!?"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
This is what used with the support sticks!
Lang:
.........Come again?
Edgeworth:
Isn't it obvious? Someone used those with this...
Franziska:
"Those with this"...? Could you be any more vague!? Why don't you try again!?
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes, I suppose I should. (It would appear that this was insufficient in conveying what I had wanted to say. The answer should become obvious to me if I just think calmly about it once more. But the only tjing that can really connect the two offices together has to be this!)
Leads back to:
"And the object that completes the picture when used with the support sticks is...!"
Lang:
Th-That's a crossbow... Wait! You're not really suggesting...!?
Edgeworth:
I am. These hair sticks... or rather, plant support sticks... They make for perfect arrows!
Lang:
Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Examine evidence
Ring on Crossbow Arrows
Edgeworth:
I thought these loops were just an eccentric design quirk... ...but who knew that they were actually arrow fletchings?
Edgeworth:
(I've done it! I've found the common thread that connects the two offices! But this thread has yet to be completely untangled. Even using the arrows, how does this explain how the statues were transported? Furthermore, who could it have been who fired these sticks as arrows? There MUST be a common thread that ties all of these things together!)
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor! Hold up a second! You do realize what happens when you tie a statue to an arrow, right? They don't fly at all!
-- Border-Crossing, Pt. 2 --
Lang:
So Babahl's statue was draped in the Yatagarasu's clothes, and then shot over here?
Even if you fired the arrows from this side, they wouldn't go far with a statue tied to them!
I don't think I need to tell you that the Primidux Statue didn't sprout wings.
You're a realist, after all, aren't you?
Edgeworth:
The Primidux Statues didn't sprout wings...? Hmph. Of course they didn't.
Lang:
Glad you understand. I feel you much better already. I was afraid for a second that you were unaware of that crucial fact!
Edgeworth:
It's only crucial because you're under the belief that wings are necessary to this equation.
Lang:
What?
Edgeworth:
You need to free your mind a bit more, and let it fly like a bird on the wind. The Primidux Statues flew, but not on a wing. Allow me a bit of your time, and I'll explain this mysterious phenomenon to you!
Rebuttal
-- Border-Crossing, Pt. 2 --
Lang:
So Babahl's statue was draped in the Yatagarasu's clothes, and then shot over here?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
But that incredible scene just happened to have been caught on film, resulting in this photo.
Lang:
Hah! And what an incredible scene it was! This photo was taken by a freelance photojournalist, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes, so I hear.
Lang:
And not every photojournalist is known to be honest, right? Especially not the ones that sell photos of spirits and giant creatures to tabloids.
Edgeworth:
Yes, I know what you mean. I've seen those sorts of photos many a time in court. But there have been times when those photos have turned out to be telling the truth. If you had ever stood in a court of law, you would know that it's entirely plausible.
Lang:
Hah! You really believe the stuff you're spewing right now? A courtroom certainly is a strange place, if what you say is true. But there really is something odd about that photo no matter how you look at it.
Lang:
Even if you fired the arrows from this side, they wouldn't go far with a statue tied to them!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
But we are in agreement that an arrow by itself would reach the other side, correct?
Lang:
But just the arrow by itself is pretty meaningless, don't you think, Mr. Prosecutor? Because the things they wanted to smuggle were a lot bigger than nothing!
Edgeworth:
No, that's not necessarily true.
Lang:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Edgeworth:
(What I need right now... ...is not further discussion of my conclusions; it's the launching of my conclusions! What the shooter wanted to launch with the crossbow was not the statues themselves! But rather, something a crossbow can launch that can be used to move the statues!)
Add statement:
"If it wasn't a statue that was tied to the arrows, then what did the crossbow launch...?"
Lang:
If it wasn't a statue that was tied to the arrows, then what did the crossbow launch...?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The thing the crossbow launched...? Allow me to show you the answer!
Lang:
Well, come on, then! Show me what you've got! But I warn you! I'll know when you're just bluffing!
Edgeworth:
This is what was launched from this Allebahstian office with the crossbow!
Present Wire
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Finally..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence is what was launched from here in Allebahst!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
And what purpose, exactly, did launching that serve? Because if you're joking, it's not gonna be a fit of laughter I'm about to launch into!
Edgeworth:
Ack! (That was not the kind of launch I was looking for.)
Lang:
Hah! I knew you couldn't explain this whole thing in a down-to-earth manner!
Present Wire
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Finally..."
Lang:
I don't think I need to tell you that the Primidux Statue didn't sprout wings.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. The statues didn't need wings to fly.
Lang:
Then how would YOU explain things? I'm almost looking forward to whatever fantastical explanation you come up with!
Lang:
You're a realist, after all, aren't you?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Of course, and I assure you that my hypothesis is firmly grounded in reality.
Lang:
Hah! Well, all I'm hearing is the fantasy of a desperate man!
Edgeworth:
At times, even reality itself can be a mysterious thing. Even you must admit that.
Lang:
Heh, do I? If it's so true, then why don't you go ahead and show me!?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! I think I understand what went sailing through the air!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I suppose that's because you're an expert at things that fly through the air.
Kay:
What did you expect from the second Yatagarasu!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Now, to show Agent Lang what really went soaring through the air tonight.
Edgeworth:
Finally... Finally, we have reached this point in our discussion. For I present to you, that which was carried by the arrow from the crossbow!
Lang:
Heh. I get it now, Mr. Prosecutor... I can see exactly what you are trying to say! You're saying that the wire was tied to an arrow and then shot into Mr. Coachen's office! All the way from the fifth floor of the Allebahstian Embassy... ...down to the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy!
Lang:
If what you're claiming is really what happened... ...I can see how Allebahst's Primidux Statue could be moved. Gravity could be used to move the statue down the wire from the fifth to the third floor. But then, what about Babahl's Primidux Statue? The dark shadow in this photo is clearly flying away from Babahl! Going in the opposite way of gravity, from the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy... ...up to the fifth floor of the Allebahstian Embassy...! How do you explain that!?
Edgeworth:
(Aha! I think I finally see how the gears behind this whole trick works!) Agent Lang, the "motion" used behind this trick... I wonder if perhaps you have yet to envision how it works in your head?
Lang:
"Motion"? What motion?
Edgeworth:
This is the motion that was employed to smuggle Babahl's Primidux Statue!
Rotary motion
Leads to:
"I believe it was done via rotary motion."
Swinging motion
Edgeworth:
A swinging motion was employed.
Lang:
Heh! You sure thought that one through, Mr. Prosecutor! Because if they used that... ...the statue would swing right into the building's wall!
Edgeworth:
Arngh! (H-He does have me there...)
Lang:
For shame! You should sign yourself up for grade school physics for not realizing that!
Edgeworth:
Nnrrrrgh... (I'm at a loss for words to that... I need to calm down and think through this once more. There is only one feasible motion that could've been used to send the statue up!)
Leads back to:
"This is the motion that was employed to smuggle Babahl's Primidux Statue!"
Bungee action
Edgeworth:
A bit of bungee action was employed!
Lang:
...Bungee action? Are you saying that the wire acted as a bungee cord, and then the statue was hauled up?
Edgeworth:
That's a simple way of putting it, but yes.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hah! Did you think about the weight of the statue at all? That thing is solid gold! Before that thing ever reached the office window, the wire would've snapped!
Edgeworth:
Nngh...
Lang:
But OK, let's consider your idea and say that the wire has the elasticity required. If you fired that kind of wire from a crossbow... ...the arrow could come sailing back at the person who shot it! Talk about dangerous!
Edgeworth:
Nnrrrrgh! (H-He's absolutely right...)
Lang:
I thought this sort of thing was common knowledge. I'm having a bit of hard time right now dealing with a jurisdiction thief... ...who lacks understanding of the most basic things like physics, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
(...Unfortunately for me, it appears that Agent Lang is correct. I need to calm down and think through this once more. There is only one feasible motion that could've been used to send the statue up!)
Leads back to:
"This is the motion that was employed to smuggle Babahl's Primidux Statue!"
Edgeworth:
I believe it was done via rotary motion. If the two statues were transported simultaneously...
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
"Simultaneously"!? Get real! The statues would collide somewhere along the way!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Did I ever say that there was only one line of wire between the two offices? If you shot an arrow with the two ends of a wire tied to it, a circular belt can be formed.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "Don't object and call a success what is beyond reasonability." Talking into account the tension difference between the two wires... ...the top one would sag too much to the point where the statues would collide anyway!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... As you know, the Primidux Statue is a one-of-a-kind national treasure. And the fact that Babahl's statue is a hollow replica of the real statue... ...it would naturally be lighter than the real one, meaning that my idea is very possible!
Lang:
Lang Zi says: HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWL!
Edgeworth:
Here is what I believe happened. Ms. Yew and her mystery co-conspirator set themselves up in the two different rooms. The co-conspirator bridged the rooms by shooting the 2 ends of the wire down on 1 arrow. Then the two of them covered the statues and proceeded to transport the statues. After the switch was completed, another arrow was fired... ...carrying the other end of the wire down to Babahl, where it was to be disposed of. And to do that, Ms. Yew hid it inside the grandfather clock. Q.E.D.
Lang:
...Hah! Ha ha ha ha... Grr!
Franziska:
This proves it, right, Agent Lang!? That I'm not the killer!
Lang:
Not yet, sis. I still haven't had my dessert yet. Right, Mr. Prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
The proof is in the pudding, as it were?
Lang:
Pudding IS a nice dessert. So? Do you think you can do it? Can you prove that what you said is what happened? Because remember, if you can't... ...I'll be taking a certain someone back home with me as a souvenir!
Edgeworth:
I agree that as long as there is no proof, my hypothesis remains just that. However... ...what I have laid out is no mere hypothesis, for there is one more piece of evidence.
Lang:
One more? This should be interesting. You think you have a piece of evidence that will turn your hypothesis into fact...? Well then, let's see it, Mr. Prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
(The thing that made it possible to create a circular belt out of a length of wire... I believe that it is right here in this very room! Now then, I believe this is what made the circular belt transportation method possible!)
Present ceiling fan
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"Hah! Looks like you dropped another bomb on us again!"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
The circular belt method was made possible thanks to this part of the room!
Lang:
Hah! Don't you mean "impossible", Mr. Prosecutor?
Franziska:
...I have to say, I agree.
Lang:
Haaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Even the one in the most precarious situation here agrees with me!
Franziska:
I am a Von Karma... ...and as I have a name to uphold... ...I refuse to accept anything that is less than perfect!
Edgeworth:
Nngh... (I guess I was mistaken... I need to take another good look at this room. There is something here that made it possible to create a circular belt out of wire!)
Leads back to:
"(Now then, I believe this is what made the circular belt transportation method possible!)"
Lang:
Hah! Looks like you dropped another bomb on us again!
Franziska:
The last piece to the trick... are two pulleys!
Edgeworth:
Precisely! The ceiling fans double as pulleys in this case! And thanks to the fact that there is one installed in each of the offices... ...the ceiling fans made for the perfect pulley set for the wire to run on!
Lang:
A...Aaa.........Arruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh!
Edgeworth:
(This must be it! This is how the smugglers bypassed the impenetrable security!)
Lang:
Ha... Ha ha ha ha ha! Grr... You really are something else, Mr. Prosecutor! I bet you've figured it all out already, haven't you!? You know who the bug hotshot that set up this real-life stage show is, don't you!?
Edgeworth:
(The person who set up this rather large and complex stage show... ...needs to be someone who had foreknowledge of... ...the existence of a ceiling fan in both the Allebahstian and Babahlese offices. And that the passionflowers' support stakes could be used as arrows...) The real mastermind behind this case.........
Lang:
Well!? Don't you dare make this wolf wait for his food!
Franziska:
Why are you so hesitant, Miles Edgeworth? If you can't say who it is, why don't you present something like you always do!?
Edgeworth:
(A single point of the finger here, and this case will explode into an international incident. However! It's already too late for me to stop the forward momentum! It appears that I have no choice now... but to rush in!) There is a piece of evidence that will point us to who the mysterious mastermind is!
Present Passionflowers or Crossbow Arrows
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This smuggling could not have been possible without the use of the crossbow."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Well? What do you think now, Agent Lang?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hah! You may talk big... but as usual, it's nothing more than a big bluff!
Edgeworth:
Gnrk! (Was I wrong!? Perhaps I should gather a bit more information before I attempt this again...)
Leads back to:
"There is a piece of evidence that will point us to who the mysterious mastermind is!"
Edgeworth:
This smuggling could not have been possible without the use of the crossbow. Furthermore, the arrows that were shot by the crossbow... ...were plucked, as it were, from the flower box in this very room. They were planted so long ago that the passionflowers had the time to grow so big... ...that Ms. von Karma didn't even notice the arrows when she visited this room today!
Lang:
............
Edgeworth:
On top of all this, the fact that the culprit knew that both offices had ceiling fans... ...tells us that the person has very detailed information on the embassy's layout. So as you may have already guessed, the person I am accusing of hatching this plan... ...is the person who grew the flowers in the flower box with the utmost care. Thus, it can only be you! Quercus Alba!
Franziska:
!
Lang:
!
Alba:
..................
Franziska:
Are you out of your mind, Miles Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
I'm certain of what I am saying, and I am sure that he is the culprit.
Lang:
Heh... Heh heh heh heh......... Haaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Tell me, Mr. Prosecutor. What was the ambassador trying to accomplish by doing all that stuff you just outlined? Why in the world would he need to use a trick like that?
Edgeworth:
I understand your need to doubt me. However, there is one thing that stands out to me as very odd.
Lang:
Just one thing, huh?
Edgeworth:
(The one, single end result Ambassador Alba sought to obtain... If we were to examine the focus of this complex trick... ...I believe we will finally find the answer to everything!) Everything will become clear once we examine this piece of evidence!
Present Allebahst's Primidux Statue
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I would fully understand the reasoning had the situation been the reserve."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Lang:
You want us to examine this?
Edgeworth:
Yes, for I believe that by examining it, we will finally have all of our answers.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "Items that become evidence should never have any part overlooked." All evidence related to this case are fine and don't need to be examined again!
Edgeworth:
Ack! (I-It would appear that I was mistaken... Agent Lang is correct... Most of the evidence has already undergone intense scrutiny. However, there is one piece that has only been partially checked... And that piece, which lies at the heart of the smuggling, is what I should present!)
Leads back to:
"Everything will become clear once we examine this piece of evidence!"
Edgeworth:
I would fully understand the reasoning had the situation been the reserve. However, to go through the trouble of swapping the real Primidux Statue for the fake... I sense a very shady reason for such a bizarre action! And who better to ask for that reason than King Primidux himself!
Lang:
I see... Ambassador, we'll be examining that statue now, with or without your permission!
Alba:
............................................................
Examine head
Leads to:
"Hmm... This guy kind of looks like the Steel Samurai, don't you think?"
Examine sword
Edgeworth:
With his sword drawn like that, there is an aura of valor and bravery around King Primidux.
Kay:
He looks so cool standing like that with the sword stuck in the ground in front of him. Maybe I should try and come up with some cool pose with a shuriken or something!
Edgeworth:
(I am seriously beginning to think that her real goal in life is to become a ninja.)
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. There isn't anything particularly odd about the sword, right?
Edgeworth:
No, not really. I suppose we should examine a different area of the statue now.
Examine shield
Edgeworth:
A shield, huh... There doesn't seem to be anything unusual about it.
Kay:
I bet it's supposed to mean that the guy is protecting something!
Edgeworth:
I don't think it's supposed to have that deep of a meaning behind it.
Kay:
In that case, what are we wasting time with this for? Let's look at some other area!
Examine handprint on bottom
Edgeworth:
These are Mr. Coachen's fingerprints. The fact that they're on here suggests that this statue once belong to Babahl.
Kay:
So it was smuggled from Babahl to Allebahst, huh?
Edgeworth:
(Why was there a need for them to smuggle it in?)
Kay:
Hmm... This guy kind of looks like the Steel Samurai, don't you think? Maybe it's because they look alike that he was picked to be the goodwill ambassador?
Edgeworth:
I suppose that's possible. ............Hm? Take a look at this area around the base of his neck. It looks like a gap.
Kay:
Hey! You're right! Maybe it's meant to be some kind of secret?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps it's possible to open the statue from this gap in its construction!
Lang:
What...!?
Franziska:
Hurry up and open it, Miles!
Edgeworth:
...Alright, here goes.
Kay:
Wow! It really did open up! Hey, what's this thing that fell out?
Edgeworth:
Hm...? I believe a more thorough examination of it is required.
Examine plate
Leads to:
"What in the...!? Is this...!?"
Edgeworth:
What in the...!? Is this...!?
Lang:
Hey! Is this what I think it is...!?
Franziska:
It's a plate... for making counterfeit bills!
Edgeworth:
Somehow... it appears that we've at long last arrived... ...at the exit to this complex labyrinth! We finally hold within our hands, one of the counterfeit money plates... ...and the reason why the replica was smuggled into Allebahst to begin with!
Counterfeit Plate data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
The Primidux Statue can only be handled by the ambassador or the secretariat. And the replica is nothing more than a hollow shell covered in gold. These two circumstances make the statue the ideal object in which to hide contraband. After receiving the statue containing the counterfeit plate from Shih-na... ...the ambassador had the misfortune of accidentally running into DeMasque II. Surprised by the thief, the ambassador raised the replica statue at DeMasque II, and... Then, in order to frame the Steel Samurai of murder... ...he covered the Samurai Sword in blood. Well, Ambassador Alba?
Examine evidence
Front side of Counterfeit Plate
Edgeworth:
It's a counterfeit plate used to make counterfeit Zheng Fa bills. It's incredibly detailed, and even includes a phoenix taking off into the sky. With plates as finely crafted as these, it's no wonder the fakes are so hard to spot.
Alba:

You're... the leader of the smuggling ring? My country is a mess... ...and it's all because of you!?
Franziska:
YOU'RE... the one who killed DeMasque II?
Edgeworth:
Answer us!
Alba:
..................I never thought... I never thought... that you would figure things out to this level.
Edgeworth:
...!
Alba:
However, there is one point I disagree with you on. The head of the smuggling ring was......... Mr. Coachen.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Quite screwin' around! I have no sympathy for someone who would try to pass the guilt onto a dead man! If there is one thing I'm sure of, it's that you're the real ringleader, Quercus Alba!
Alba:
It's not good to speak with such subjectivity, you know, Agent Lang.
Lang:
"Subjectivity"? My conclusion is anything but, and is the result of logic and investigation!
Alba:
"Logic and investigation"? Only seconds ago, you were ready to arrest Ms. von Karma. I don't think we can give such flip-floppy logic any real weight, do you?
Lang:
Heh......... .........Heh heh heh... Haa ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Alba:
?
Edgeworth:
?
Lang:
It looks like you still don't get why I came back.
Alba:
Excuse me?
Lang:
You see, the reason I came back... ...is so that I could sink my fangs into your wrinkly, old neck! From the very beginning, my real target has been you!
Alba:
What?
Franziska:
Agent Lang! I demand an explanation!
Lang:
Sorry, sis. I didn't mean to put you through all that. I knew you were innocent from the very beginning.
Franziska:
You did...?
Lang:
I knew that this whole incident had been meticulously planned and prepared for. So naturally, the occupant of this room, Ambassador Alba, seemed the most suspicious. But without the ambassador's permission, we couldn't get in to take another look around!
Edgeworth:
Ah, so that's why you put on this big show to accuse Franziska of the murder! Using Franziska as the bait, you were able to gain us entry and investigative rights!
Lang:
Yeah, if I hadn't done that, I doubt the ambassador would've given the OK to poke around.
Franziska:
So that's what all this was about... Very well, I will forgive you. But in exchange for using me as bait... ...you will take some responsibility and help us find the truth!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, for giving me such a great opening... I thank you.
Lang:
............You know, I just knew, Mr. Prosecutor... ...that somehow, if we were able to find some proof by investigating this room... ...that you would be able to figure out the real culprit with your special brand of logic.
Edgeworth:
Heh, the evidence detectives collect combined with the logic of a prosecutor... That's just as it should be in a "prosecutor - detective team", right?
Lang:
Tch. I don't know about all that! But one thing I do know is that I'm itching to see that old man get what's coming to him!
Alba:
Ho ho. You're quite scary when you want to be, aren't you?
Lang:
Hey, you were the one who was planning to use me to push all the guilt onto the sis. But unfortunately for you, you misjudged me!
Alba:
..................Agent Lang, I wish for you to stop trying to intimidate me. What we need right now is evidence and proof. I wonder if you have what is necessary to prove that I am the head of the smuggling ring?
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Don't be such a sore loser! If you really are the head of the smuggling ring... ...then you should acknowledge your crimes with dignity!
Alba:
Dignity...? That is nothing more than a fool's insincere display of strength. If you really wish for me to acknowledge my crimes... ...then I would like to first see some of this thing you call "evidence".
Franziska:
Grr...!
Alba:
I tell you... I knew nothing. Really. I didn't even know that a counterfeit plate was hidden inside that statue.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You swapped a real statue that vested in your country the authority to rule for a sake. It doesn't make any sense that you didn't know anything!
Alba:
It doesn't make sense? Where doesn't it make sense? Can you prove that it doesn't make sense?
Edgeworth:
Gnnrk!
Franziska:
...He's really got us. He's... turned the entire situation around against us.
Alba:
..................
Edgeworth:
(The proof that Interpol has been after which points to this man as the ringleader... If we can somehow find that proof now, then we can see to it that justice is finally served! Is there nothing I can use to break this case wide open!?) ...! The trump card and the video tape... (With those two items... ...we might be able to finally bring this man down. But...! The card is evidence from a case that Mr. Faraday hid away in secret... ...and the tape was stolen by Detective Badd from the police. They're both illegal evidence! No matter what, a protector of the law can't be allowed to use such pieces of evidence!)
Manfred:
Needless to say... ...we Von Karmas are commanded to achieve nothing but victory! And by any means necessary!
Badd:
The only way to bring someone like that to justice was to do so outside of the courts... That's what we thought... at the time.
Edgeworth:
(I no longer follow the path of Manfred von Karma... ...and I won't follow the path of the Yatagarasu! This leaves me with what? What creed will I believe in? If I want to pursue the truth, then I will sully my hands in illegality... ...and if I want to pursue justice, then I will lose the truth! What is the "law", and what is "justice"? And which path is a "prosecutor" supposed to follow!? That choice... is one I must make by my own hand here and now!)
Use the trump card
Leads to:
"(There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man.)"
Don't use the trump card
Edgeworth:
(I am a prosecutor, and I can't allow myself to use evidence such as these!)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! If you don't do something, Ambassador Alba is going to get away with it!
Edgeworth:
Nngh... I know, but...
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
What are you holding back for? The only thing a Von Karma should pursue is the perfect proof. If you really do have what it takes to complete our argument... ...then there is absolutely no reason not to use it!
Edgeworth:
Nngh...
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "The reason people judge people is because people are people." People weren't born to be chained to the law; laws were born to protect the people. You're the only one here right now who can put this guy out to pasture... ...and that is the only way a second or a third generation of Zheng Fa's people will be born. Can you really still hesitate knowing the fate of a nation rests in your hands?
Edgeworth:
I...
Leads to:
"(There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man.)"
Edgeworth:
(There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man. When a person goes beyond that limit, then the law, too, crosses into new territory! For what reason were laws invented? The answer to that is what I must now show!) Ambassador Alba. I wonder if you might recognize this.
Alba:
...! Oh, I wonder what that card is? I've never seen that before in my life.
Edgeworth:
It's a directives card used by the leader of the ring to relay instructions to his subordinates.
Alba:
Oh? Is that what it is?
Edgeworth:
This card was sent to the real culprit behind the KG-8 Incident, ten years ago... A man by the name of Mr. Manny Coachen.
Alba:
.........Oh. So why do you have such a card in your possession?
Edgeworth:
Because it was hand-delivered to me... ...by a certain Great Thief... The Yatagarasu!
Alba:
The Yatagarasu gave that to you...? Don't talk nonsense, and let's be serious, Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof that the card contains directions from the ringleader?
Edgeworth:
I'll have you know that the card is not the only thing I was given!
Alba:
What!?
Edgeworth:
This contains security footage that was shot just before the start of the KG-8 Incident.
Alba:
...The KG-8 Incident...?
Edgeworth:
The card and the video... These two pieces of evidence are what will seal your fate!
Alba:
............Hoho, very interesting. I must admit I am very curious now. Very curious indeed in these "case-deciding" pieces of evidence you've presented.
Edgeworth:
(The prey the Yatagarasu has been chasing all this time... now stands before me. I can't allow this man, who has had free reign for ten long years, to simply walk away. Now is the time for me to bring to fruition the valiant spirit that was given to me!)
March 15, 1:34 AMTheatrum NeutralisLobby
Alba:
So, what is this interesting thing that you wanted to show me?
Edgeworth:
(The trump card and the video tape... These two pieces of evidence together make for the ultimate hand! And this is where the real meaning behind Detective Badd's words will realized!) Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
What you see here is security footage shot just before the KG-8 murder occurred. From this footage, we know that the card is a directives card from the smuggling ring. This is the section that proves that the card was used to relay an order!
Present black card
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Hah! Looks like you dropped another bomb on us again!"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Take a look at this area.
Alba:
What about that area...? My eyes aren't what they used to be, so I can't see what you're pointing at too well. But from what I can see, it doesn't look like it's related to our conversation...
Edgeworth:
Nngh...! (It's unrelated...!? I need to remain calm and take another look at this footage. What is the vital clue that shows us that card was used to relay an order!?)
Leads back to:
"This is the section that proves that the card was used to relay an order!"
Edgeworth:
As you can see, Mr. Coachen is holding the card in his right hand.
Alba:
I see. The killer is indeed holding a card with the exact same design on it. But the card and the one you have... Just because they look the same, doesn't mean that they are, does it now?
Edgeworth:
Ah, but there is a very easy way for me to prove that they are, in fact, one and the same. All we have to do is simply take a look at this!
Examine raven
Edgeworth:
According to Detective Badd... ...Ambassador Alba's directive cards bears the mark of a three-legged raven... ...or in other words, a yatagarasu. I suppose this mark was the inspiration for their group's name, the Yatagarasu.
Examine bloodstain
Leads to:
"This dark red blood... Yes, this is your proof."
Examine text
Edgeworth:
A section of the text has been obscured by blood, but it's clear the writing is Cohdopian. According to Detective Badd... ..."Silence Cece Yew"... ...is what is written here... ...along with the method to be used and where she lived. The evil intent displayed in this writing will not go unpunished!
Edgeworth:
This dark red blood... Yes, this is your proof. Proof that the orders on this card were played out in that terrible tragedy! The blood belonged to the victim of the KG-8 Incident. With a bit of DNA testing, we can very easily verify that as fact.
Alba:
..................
Edgeworth:
If you have no objections... ...then I'd like for you to take a look at this next piece of footage! This car that passed by in front of the victim's apartment building... It's an official Cohdopian government car.
Alba:
Wh-What!?
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe! If you could please magnify the footage! This area of the footage directly links the smuggling ring with Cohdopia!
Present pocket
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Hah! Looks like you dropped another bomb on us again!"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This section will make it all clear to us!
Alba:
.........You must be very tired, Mr. Edgeworth. If you continue presenting completely irrelevant evidence like this... ...I'm afraid your investigation may fall apart. Perhaps it is time for you to retire.
Edgeworth:
W-Wait! (Arngh! But I was so sure it was this area...! Alright, focus, Miles. The area I should be pointing out is definitely here!)
Leads back to:
"This area of the footage directly links the smuggling ring with Cohdopia!"
Edgeworth:
The shape of this pocket... and the directives card in it... It tells us that without a doubt, this person in this car is Mr. Coachen!
Alba:
...Gnrk!
Edgeworth:
The license plate on the car was also captured by the security camera. And with it, we can easily find out who was sitting in this car on that day, ten years ago.
Alba:
Gnnrgh!
Edgeworth:
Which is why I can say with confidence that you were riding in this car on that day!
Alba:
Arnnnnnnnnnnnngh!
Alba:
..................Hah. Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah! You've done well, boy, to make it this far. However...! About your claim that I was riding in the car at the time... That's going to be mighty difficult to prove.
Edgeworth:
How so?
Alba:
The Principality of Cohdopia no longer exists. So naturally, all records from that time period also no longer exist.
Edgeworth:
(Nngh! That arrogance... What he really means is he's already erased all traces of them!)
Alba:
Are we finished here, boy?
Edgeworth:
(The only weapon I have left to me now... is this piece of footage! There must be something here that I can use against him!)
Present medal
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Wh-What the...!"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Franziska, what do you think about this area?
Franziska:
If you have to confer with someone, then it's obviously a useless piece of logic!
Edgeworth:
Gnnoooh! (Arngh! She's right. The only logic that can trap Ambassador Alba is a perfectly iron-clad one. There must be something here in this footage! There must be something that shows that Ambassador Alba was riding in the car that day! No matter how insignificant it may seem, a clue must be hiding here, and I must find it.)
Leads back to:
"(There must be something here that I can use against him!)"
Edgeworth:
Wh-What the...! Ambassador Alba!
Alba:
Yes, what is it?
Edgeworth:
You were once an army man in the service of Cohdopia. And it was you who made the many missions you participated in successes, correct?
Alba:
Hmph. Why the sudden back-handed praises, boy? Although, to be sure... ...the brilliant medals on my breast were awarded to me during the era of Cohdopia. But now, I am the only one who owns this particular medal.
Edgeworth:
In that case... the only person it could be who is sitting in this car is you!
Alba:
How do you figure that!?
Edgeworth:
By the medal captured here in this footage! It is clearly the same exact medal as the one on your chest!
Alba:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Edgeworth:
(This is how it will be... But I won't look back. For this is the path that I have chosen!)
Alba:
Gnnrrr... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. You've moved me with your devotion to this case, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(Why is he taking such an arrogant stance with me?)
Alba:
It's almost looking possible, isn't it? For the lot of you to have come this far... It looks like I just might lose our little game this time.
Lang:
You might lose the game "this time"...? You don't get another round, Mr. Ambassador!
Alba:
Is that a fact? ...Very well. I've decided to confess and admit my guilt.
Franziska:
You're... going to confess?
Alba:
And I will accept whatever punishment that may come as a result.
Lang:
What the...?
Alba:
Regarding the DeMasque II murder, I admit it... I did it out of self-defense.
Edgeworth:
You're claiming it was justified self-defense!?
Alba:
DeMasque II attacked me, and I felt that my life was in danger. If I hadn't done what I did, I might be the one you found dead instead of him.
Lang:
Haa ha ha ha ha ha ha! What a pathetic performance!
Alba:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! I'm not giving you one!
Kay:
Wow, you two really know how to laugh at inappropriate times!
Edgeworth:
If you wish to claim it was justified self-defense, then we will need some evidence.
Alba:
It's always the evidence with you, isn't it? But if that's what you require, I'll provide it. That man left a mark on me when he attacked!
Edgeworth:
What!?
Alba:
I don't particularly want to show it off, but this is proof that it was in self-defense. I'm an old man, and sometimes I don't pay enough attention when I should...
Franziska:
But DeMasque II didn't have a single weapon on his body!
Alba:
Hold on. It's nothing to get worked up over, because... I hid the weapon.
Franziska:
You hid it?
Alba:
I'm sorry, but as you know, a murder is a murder, even if it's in self-defense. And I couldn't let it become public, seeing as how I AM an ambassador... This is the weapon you seek, my special bonsai trimming shears.
Kay:
Oongh... It's covered in blood.
Alba:
He was trembling quite badly during our struggle... ...but that's when he grabbed the shears that were sitting in my office and attacked. So you see, it was an act of self-defense.
Kay:
Is he right, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
Since he has both a wound and the weapon that caused it, it's enough to declare it so.
Amb. Alba's Wound data jotted down in my Organizer.
Kay:
N-No way...!
Alba:
Oh, which reminds me. I guess there is still one more accusation I need to resolve. Smuggling and counterfeiting. Unfortunately, all of that is my secretary's doing. I had no knowledge it was going on.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Stop spewing nonsense! You're trying to throw my investigation under the bus in your desperation. If you want to get real honest... ...everything in this case can be connected to you!
Franziska:
The murder of DeMasque II was done in self-defense...!? In my trials, no man escapes his crime alive!
Alba:
Perhaps so, if you were my opponent in court. However, there is one very important fact that I think you may have forgotten.
Edgeworth:
And what is that...? .................. A.........Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
Lang:
Arngh! That's what you mean! Extraterritoriality...!
Alba:
That's right. This embassy sits on what is effectively Allebahstian soil. So any trial that is to be held will be held in Allebahst. Therefore, the crime I just admitted to will never be tried in your courts.
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang! What is Interpol's stance on this!?
Lang:
Agents investigate. That's our job. The judgment of people who have confessed to their crime... that's the court's job.
Edgeworth:
Gnnrk!
Alba:
And I've already confessed to all of my crimes, Agent Lang. Furthermore, by the very nature of my position, I have full extraterritorial rights. These rights are effective, even on your country's soil. Therefore... ...no matter where a crime may take place, I will never stand trial in one of your courts!
Lang:
That arrogance... and your expression... That's nothing like the face of someone who is ready to accept the consequences. Don't tell me you have your own country's judicial system eating right out of your hands!
Alba:
These "crimes" you all speak so seriously of... To me, this has all been nothing more than a game. You may chase me out of this embassy with your accusations... ...but it's no big deal. Allebahst has numerous other embassies in other countries around the world. All you would accomplish is you would change the backdrop of our little game!
Edgeworth:
(These two layers of protection that extraterritoriality provides him... This is why he is one of those who cannot be brought to court!)
Alba:
You see now, don't you? I live in a whole different world than you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go and fetch your eviction papers.
Edgeworth:
Arngh! Is there nothing we can do!?
To be continued.
March 15, 2:11 AMTheatrum NeutralisLobby
Gumshoe:
I can't believe it, sir! Extraterritoriality...
Edgeworth:
Yes... and there is nothing we can really do about that. In the end, we didn't have enough authority to bring him to justice.
Kay:
I can't believe that even though we know he's the boss, we can't lay a finger on him!
Edgeworth:
I know...
Lang:
.................. Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, sorry to skip out on you, but I've got some business to take care of.
Kay:
If we can't even give an evil guy like him a slap on the wrist... ...then what the heck were laws created for!? What good are they!? If the law can't help us... ...then I'll go as the Yatagarasu, and take care of this myself!
Edgeworth:
Don't you dare!
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
...Sorry, that was a bit too harsh.
Gumshoe:
I know how you feel, sir. We're trying to take on an ambassador, after all. And he did tell us earlier to get out of the theater. This is kinda their country, I guess... ...but I feel like I've been slapped across the face for just doing my job.
Edgeworth:
(What... am I going to do? Should I retreat for now, and formulate a better plan of attack...?)
Hold it!
Kay:
Come on, everyone! We can't give up yet!
Edgeworth:
Kay...?
Kay:
I want you to think about something for a sec! We've never let up for even a second, and as long as we don't stop investigating... ...we might find the "rotten" treasure hidden here!
Gumshoe:
Sh-She's right!
Kay:
Come on, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
...You're right, Kay. Very well. Let us re-open the investigation and see what we find. Come on, Kay!
Kay:
Right behind you!
Gumshoe:
OK! Then I'll go check out Babahl a bit more, sir!
Franziska:
And I have something that I need to investigate further in Allebahst.
Edgeworth:
(Now then... ...before I gather any more information, I should do a bit of housekeeping.)
Passionflowers data erased from my Organizer.
Begin Investigation
Theatrum NeutralisLobby
Edgeworth:
Ambassador Alba seemed agitated (Agitated Alba - I sense that there is something he doesn't want us to investigate.) over something.
Kay:
I wonder why?
Edgeworth:
There are two special circumstances that surround the ambassador. First, the embassy itself has extraterritorial rights. If something happens on Allebahstian soil... ...we are unable to legally prosecute him.
Kay:
Cool! It sounds like embassies are the perfect place to steal whatever you want!
Edgeworth:
...And murder DeMasque II, run a smuggling operation, and make counterfeit bills apparently.
Kay:
But I thought all the counterfeiting was done by Mr. Coachen in Babahl?
Edgeworth:
Yes, he apparently used the embassy's coupon printing press (Coachen's counterfeiting op. - Used Babahlese Embassy's printing press and Babahlese ink to make counterfeit bills.) to do it. But it's the same story over there anyway. Babahl also has extraterritorial rights. Which brings me to my next point: the ambassador's extraterritorial rights. Those rights are effective even in our own country.
Kay:
Really?
Edgeworth:
No matter what happens, he can never be tried in our courts. He retains some very special rights, indeed. Basically, no matter what wrongs he may commit, we can't bring him to trial here.
Kay:
So I guess we really don't stand a chance, do we?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... We might stand a chance if we can somehow nullify either one of his special rights.
Logic
"Renovations" and "Coachen's counterfeiting op."
Edgeworth:
We know that the counterfeit bills were printed using the embassy's press... ...but the necessary materials, such as the Babahlese ink and paper... ...must have been hidden in a secure location. But what do you think would've happened if the renovation had begun?
Kay:
Well, he probably had to find a better hiding place, or get rid of it all.
Edgeworth:
Right, so we can assume that the renovation was the cause of the plate and bills disposal. And the reason Mr. Coachen was killed as the "ringleader" of the smuggling operation. ...Based on what we know, who do you think was the one with the most to gain?
Colias Palaeno
Edgeworth:
The answer is Ambassador Palaeno.
Kay:
Y-You really think so!? But he was the one who had his embassy's offices burned down... ...and he lost his secretary. Do you really think he profited from any of that?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Now that you mention it, perhaps not... (She's right... Ambassador Palaeno has gained absolutely nothing from the events of tonight. With that being the case, there really is only one man who gained from everything!)
Leads back to:
"...Based on what we know, who do you think was the one with the most to gain?"
Manny Coachen
Edgeworth:
The answer is Mr. Coachen himself.
Kay:
Umm... He was the smuggling ring's boss, right? So maybe he had a lot to gain because of all the money...? But in the end, he was killed... It's kind of sad, really.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I suppose there is some truth in that. (No matter how much he may have profited in life, he really didn't gain much in his death. With that being the case, there really is only one man who gained from everything!)
Leads back to:
"...Based on what we know, who do you think was the one with the most to gain?"
Quercus Alba
Leads to:
"It's the one person who has been erasing all evidence of the smuggling operation..."
Edgeworth:
It's the one person who has been erasing all evidence of the smuggling operation... ...from both embassies, the co-conspirator who is mopping up, Ambassador Alba. Ambassador Alba had a very strong motive to kill Manny Coachen (Motive to kill Coachen - Alba could conveniently place all of the guilt for the smuggling onto Coachen.)!
"Agitated Alba" and "Motive to kill Coachen"
Edgeworth:
The cause of Ambassador Alba's agitation, the "rotten" treasure we may find... ...and the motive for killing Mr. Coachen... Ms. Yew said it herself that she didn't kill anyone tonight. If we were to take her words at face value... ...then the reason for the ambassador's nervousness can only be one thing. He didn't want us to discover the real circumstances under which Mr. Coachen was killed.
Kay:
Then you mean, Ambassador Alba is the real killer? But I thought the two of them were friends?
Edgeworth:
Maybe they were, but what if Mr. Coachen was the one who first betrayed their friendship?
Kay:
Oh, I get it! Wasn't Mr. Coachen pushing really hard for Mr. Palaeno... ...to be ambassador after the reunification?
Edgeworth:
Yes, and that was the real reason why he wanted to steal Allebahst's Primidux Statue.
Kay:
So Mr. Coachen hired DeMasque II to go steal it for him... ...but when Ambassador Alba found out what he was up to, he killed Mr. Coachen?
Edgeworth:
It is definitely a possibility at this point.
Kay:
Those two really were thinking of no one but themselves. But the question now is "how did he do it?" Ambassador Alba was in Allebahst... ...but Mr. Coachen's body was discovered in Babahl, right?
Edgeworth:
Right. And that is what we must solve next.
Partner
Kay:
Yes?
The investigation
Kay:
We've come too far to give up! We must expose Ambassador Alba's misdeeds, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Yes, of course.
Kay:
And we've gotta find a way to steal the truth and get it out there... for my father's sake!
Edgeworth:
...Yes, and we will. (The reason for Ambassador Alba's nervousness must still be here somewhere. Furthermore, I need to pin down exactly what happened in here... I'll start thoroughly examining this room for any information I can find.)
Agitated Alba?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! If you don't pay attention, Ambassador Alba is gonna get away!
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes, I know.
Kay:
Now hurry up and do that *schwing!* thing you always do!
Edgeworth:
I have no idea what you are talking about...
Kay:
What!? You don't!? Oh, come on, you know what I'm talking about! That thing you do!
Edgeworth:
...Are you talking about "Logic"...?
Kay:
Yes! That's it! So hurry up and let's *schwing!* already!
Edgeworth:
A-Alright, alright... (To be honest, it's been a bit hard to connect everything up until now by just looking. However, I should be able to piece things together if I take another look at my leads. Perhaps now is the time to use logic and reason my way to the truth!)
Present
Video Tape
Kay:
Uncle Badd entrusted you with this piece of evidence, Mr. Edgeworth. I think he believes that you're the one who will finally bring the truth to light.
Edgeworth:
.........
Kay:
And I believe in you, too, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Kay...
Guard on left door
Guard:
On the orders of Ambassador Alba, no one is allowed into Allebahst.
Edgeworth:
Nngh! But I thought a lady with a whip passed through here not too long ago.
Guard:
She is from Interpol, and had the proper paperwork... ...so, while I was reluctant, I had to let her in.
Edgeworth:
(Heh... Sounds like Franziska alright.)
Guard:
Besides... if I didn't... that whip of hers...
Edgeworth:
(.........Yup, definitely Franziska...)
Backdrop
Edgeworth:
It's a backdrop they used in the Steel Samurai stage show today.
Kay:
I loved the climax of that show! "Steel Samurai Sushi Slice!" That was the first time I'd seen that special move! But, well, the Jammin' Ninja stage show's climax was much better, of course.
Edgeworth:
...Oh, is that a fact?
Kay:
That scene where he sang for Princess Misola and gave her those hair sticks? I could totally feel the love there in my heart!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... Perhaps the Jammin' Ninja is just more popular with female audiences...?)
Flowers on left
Edgeworth:
Flowers were sent by a variety of people and businesses to celebrate the goodwill event. Even the Steel Samurai received some flowers from the ambassadors.
Kay:
There are so many bouquets here, it's like a wedding ceremony!
Edgeworth:
I believe the flowers for those are for a slightly different reason...
Kay:
What do you mean!? This event was supposed to be like a wedding between Allebahst and Babahl, right?
Edgeworth:
...Actually, I believe they're more in a state of divorce.
Kay:
OK, then! This event was supposed to be their remarriage ceremony!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I suppose you could call it that.
Photo
Edgeworth:
This was taken just before the two ambassadors gave their bouquets to the Steel Samurai. (Wait, is it just my imagination... ...or is there something in this picture that I've seen before...?)
Before deducing
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After deducing
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Quercus Alba
Kay:
I can't believe he was pretending to be a harmless old grandpa. Talk about deceptive!
Edgeworth:
I don't suppose anyone expected him to change that drastically...
Kay:
I bet he's thinking of something evil behind that cheery smile!
Edgeworth:
Kay, please try to remain calm and focused on the here and now.
Kay:
Yeah, you're right. Sorry I got all worked up there. Well, the only way we're going to be able to steal the truth is if we keep on investigating!
Alba's bouquet
Edgeworth:
It appears to be a bouquet of Persian cyclamens and roses.
Kay:
Wow! You even know the exact species!? I never would've figured you for an expert on flowers!
Edgeworth:
Nnnnngh... (It's all because of those flowers that old lady sends me every month... Just look at me; I sound like some sort of botanist!)
Before deduce
Kay:
So, umm, what exactly is this yellow flower here?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... That one... I'm not sure.
Kay:
What!? You don't know!?
Edgeworth:
(As far as I can recall, I've never seen a flower like this before. But I feel as though I've seen this shape somewhere before...)
Steel Samurai
Edgeworth:
There's that troublemaker, standing there smack in the center making two peace signs.
Kay:
Wow, the Steel Samurai stands out even more than the two ambassadors in this picture! Oh, hey! The person playing the Steel Samurai is one of your friends, right?
Edgeworth:
..................No, I have no idea who he is.
Kay:
Wait! But you just said "he"! You knew which gender he was, so you MUST know him, right!?
Edgeworth:
I beg that you please refrain from talking about that person with me ever again.
Colias Palaeno
Kay:
Mr. Palaeno has a really great smile, don't you think!? I bet he was really happy that they were going to become Cohdopia again!
Edgeworth:
Perhaps... But instead, he became the greatest victim in today's case. An ambassador like him who is always thinking of his country is really to be admired.
Kay:
Yeah. Although this happened, I hope they'll be able to reunite the country someday.
Edgeworth:
I hope so as well, but for that to happen, we need to solve this case first. We need to see to it that those who would harm the new Cohdopia are locked away.
Kay:
And we will!
Palaeno's bouquet
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It seems that lilies are at the center of this bouquet, with an accent of chamomile.
Kay:
Wow... I can totally smell the wonderful fragrance!
Edgeworth:
Kay... this is just a picture.
Kay:
Argh! Look, I know that! But it's nice to imagine things once in a while, ya know? Where's your sense of empathy!?
Edgeworth:
If you can smell the fragrance of flowers from a photo, that's more like a "hallucination".
Kay:
! Y-You don't have to be mean about it...
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Let's just drop this before it's in full bloom.
Deduce (after examining Alba's bouquet)
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce yellow flower and present Allebahstian Knife
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"Babahl's national symbol is the butterfly, and Allebahst's is the flower..."
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
Could this piece of evidence be related to this photo somehow?
Kay:
Huh? Well... Nope! I don't think it's related at all!
Edgeworth:
(Even though I know she's right, she could have at least tried to humor me a little.)
Edgeworth:
Babahl's national symbol is the butterfly, and Allebahst's is the flower... It would appear that someone is employing the old "hide a tree in a forest" trick.
Kay:
What are you mumbling to yourself about...? Wait, what? The handle on this knife... Aaaaaah!
Edgeworth:
Yes, it's the handle that was supposed to be on the blade that killed Mr. Coachen. The weapon that killed him was carried through the Theatrum Neutralis... ...in the very bouquet Ambassador Alba was carrying!
Commemorative Photo data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Hm? The flower motif... It looks like one of the flower petals is missing.
Kay:
Ooh! And take a look at the weapon itself! It's missing the exact same petal!
Edgeworth:
Then the knife in this photo is most definitely the same as this murder weapon.
Allebahstian Knife data updated in my Organizer.
Right window
Edgeworth:
You can see the Babahlese Embassy, which is undergoing major renovations. From room expansions to garden upkeep, it looks like a lot of construction is going on.
Kay:
Mr. Palaeno said that all this work is really hard on him. He said that since Mr. Coachen passed away, that maybe I could work part-time for him.
Edgeworth:
(She got really chummy with that ambassador...)
Kay:
What can I say? I just have a good nose for money!
Guard on right door
Guard:
Hello! And welcome to the Embassy of Babahl!
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but I don't really need to enter your country at this time.
Guard:
Right now, for a limited time here at the Babahlese Embassy... ...we're offering the very special "Experience the Terrifying Fire's Ashes Tour!" So, how about it? Shall I sign you up?
Edgeworth:
...We're fine, thanks. (We have an investigation to run.)
(Connecting all possible Logic and deducing yellow flower leads to:)
Edgeworth:
I believe we now understand... ...why Ambassador Alba was so nervous and agitated. It must have something to do with where Mr. Coachen was killed. A place where the Allebahstian ambassador was likely to meet the Babahlese Mr. Coachen. The place where Ambassador Alba happened to have committed the murder is...?
Present Theatrum Neutralis
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Wh-What the...!"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This area is rather suspicious, don't you think?
Kay:
You really think so? Because I don't see anything odd about it at all!
Edgeworth:
Nngh... (I guess it's not related after all...)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! If you keep doing that, Ambassador Alba is going to get away! Come on! Let's see if we can't get a hold of that treasure known as the truth!
Edgeworth:
Agreed. Let's see what we can find.
Leads back to:
"The place where Ambassador Alba happened to have committed the murder is...?"
Edgeworth:
The only place that makes sense is here, at the Threatrum Neutralis.
Kay:
What? Here?
Edgeworth:
The goodwill event was being held here today, correct? So the only place that the both of them would have been in is here.
Kay:
But if that's the case, then everything changes. The theater isn't actually Allebahstian land... ...so that wipes out one of those extraterritorial rights he has!
Edgeworth:
It makes logical sense, in which case, it is a reason for us to investigate further.
Kay:
So what should we check out?
Edgeworth:
Let's see... I believe we should check the immigration records for both Allebahst and Babahl posthaste! Babahl's records should be easy to obtain, however, the problem will be Allebahst. I wonder if they would allow us to see their records, despite the order to vacate...
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
I'm already one step ahead of you, Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Franziska.
Franziska:
I have here, the security footage from both Allebahst and Babahl. You would do well to take a look at its contents.
Security Footage data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
You move fast.
Franziska:
A Von Karma strives to be perfect in every way! It's not in my nature to keep on retreating like this. I took the liberty of looking over the Babahl investigation reports as well. From now on, you will make no excuse to back down or say that we can't solve this case!
Edgeworth:
Nngh... I'm sorry about earlier.
Franziska:
We won't be beaten. Because my cute little subordinate is going to try his very best, isn't he?
Edgeworth:
(Hasn't she patronized me enough already for a lifetime?) So this video contains footage from Allebahst's immigration screening area?
Kay:
I really hope there's something in here that we can use!
Edgeworth:
Which minute's footage should I examine?
5:21 PM
Timestamp
Edgeworth:
5:21 PM...
Kay:
That's just after the end of the Steel Samurai stage show.
Edgeworth:
Correct.
Kay:
We were still inside the theater itself at around this time. All because Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't get out of his seat.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I wanted to show the actors my appreciation for a bit and soak in the atmosphere.
Kay:
Yeah, with your eyes closed and a complete lack of motion except for some breathing.
Officer
Franziska:
This man is the immigration officer who was on duty.
Kay:
He's making a really scary face... even though there's no one around to see it.
Franziska:
I wonder if he's just the grumpy sort? Although, that's wouldn't do much for tourism.
Kay:
Hey! He smiled a little just now!
Franziska:
I wonder if he recalled something funny?
Kay:
Well, even if he did, he still has that hard glare in his eyes.
Edgeworth:
It would appear that he was born with stern-looking eyes.
Franziska:
Rather fitting for someone in the security business, I'd say.
Posters
Kay:
Ooh, I don't remember all these posters! I wonder what they're of?
Edgeworth:
Hmm, I do remember a bunch of these hanging in that hallway.
Franziska:
I believe they were all related to tourism and sightseeing.
Edgeworth:
In Allebahst? Impossible! If it were Babahl, I could believe that, however...
Franziska:
No, no. They were posters promoting tourist traps in this country! And I believe they were mostly of Gatewater Land.
Edgeworth:
I see. So they were targeted at the embassy's staff...
Door
Edgeworth:
It's the door leading into the Theatrum Neutralis.
Kay:
I tired so hard to get through this door, you know, but I just couldn't get in. But it felt soooo great when I finally was allowed to go through there! You know what I really wanted to do, though? I wanted to try sneaking my way in!
Edgeworth:
(*sigh* At least nothing seems out of the ordinary with the door.)
5:22 PM
Timestamp
Edgeworth:
5:22 PM. At around this time, the Steel Samurai stage show had come to an end... ...and Ambassador Alba was making his way back to his office.
Kay:
And then later, he shook hands with the Steel Samurai in his office... ...and then, he was going to give a speech in the rose garden. Being an ambassador sounds like a busy, busy job! It's like someone is always stealing your time away!
Edgeworth:
Yes, I'd imagine it's something like that. (But despite how busy he was, he still managed to find the time to kill Mr. Coachen... ...and move his body somehow from the Theatrum Neutralis.)
Officer
Franziska:
This man is the immigration officer who was on duty.
Kay:
He's making the exact same scary face that he was making a minute ago! Wait. Is it just me, or is he blushing?
Franziska:
It appears that he gets flustered around the ambassador.
Kay:
I guess the ambassador's well-respected inside Allebahst, too.
Edgeworth:
You could say that. The guard doesn't appear to be capable of looking at the ambassador.
Posters
Franziska:
Those are posters of this country's tourist spots, though most are of Gatewater Land.
Kay:
I wonder if Allebahstians in general like theme parks at all?
Franziska:
The guard who stopped you has been to Gatewater Land a number of times, apparently.
Kay:
I guess they don't have theme parks in Allebahst, huh?
Quercus Alba
Edgeworth:
I can't believe how completely fooled I was by the way he carried himself.
Franziska:
He had me fooled, too... According to the files I had sent for earlier, Ambassador Alba... ...was a Cohdopian hero. He saved the royal family from danger countless times. So what bothers me is why would a man like that create a smuggling ring...? Even with all the authority I have, I still haven't been able to figure out why.
Edgeworth:
(It sounds like the ambassador was a hero who was corrupted by evil. But no matter what happened in the past, we can't let the man he is now escape justice!)
Door
Edgeworth:
It's the door leading into the Theatrum Neutralis.
Kay:
The more the guy tried to keep me out, the more I wanted to get in! It's human nature! But I guess I can't complain too much. I did get let inside in the end.
Edgeworth:
(*sigh* At least nothing seems out of the ordinary with the door.)
5:23 PM
Timestamp
Edgeworth:
5:23 PM... This is just after the end of the Steel Samurai stage show... ...and after I had been given that autograph.
Kay:
You totally had stars in your eyes at that time, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
I-I most certainly did not!
Franziska:
You had stars in your eyes because of an autograph you received from that man...? Miles Edgeworth... You've just lost any respect I had left for you.
Edgeworth:
(I believe it's time to change the subject.)
Officer
Edgeworth:
It appears that he is inspecting the person coming into the country.
Kay:
Are you kidding!? It's more like he's NOT checking the Steel Samurai! Hmph! And then they gave me such a hard time!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... There ARE certain risks involved when you give some people preferential treatment.
Posters
Edgeworth:
There certainly is a variety of posters on this wall.
Kay:
It's kinda hard to see what's written on them, so they just look festive, you know?
Franziska:
Those are all tourism posters for this country, although most are of Gatewater Land.
Kay:
I wonder if any Allebahstians actually go to Gatewater Land for fun? It's just really hard to imagine them hanging out there.
Edgeworth:
True, they do seem to be a nation of extremely serious people...
Cart
Leads to:
"Doesn't something about this lump's shape strike you as odd?"
Steel Samurai
Edgeworth:
On the outside, he may look like the Steel Samurai, but on the inside, it's just Larry.
Franziska:
Other than the fact that it's that good-for-nothing, nothing else seems out of order.
Edgeworth:
Wait. You know as well as I that anything can happen if he's involved.
Franziska:
You're not suggesting that someone else could be under that mask, are you?
Edgeworth:
No, I don't think that. Just before he entered here, he gave me an autograph, so I'm certain it's Larry under there.
Door
Edgeworth:
It's the door connecting that hallway and this theater. Nothing appears to be out of the ordinary.
Franziska:
Indeed.
Edgeworth:
Doesn't something about this lump's shape strike you as odd?
Kay:
Huh? Isn't it supposed to be this shape?
Edgeworth:
No, there is clearly something odd about the bulge. If only we had the pushcart itself, we could compare and confirm my hunch...
Pushcart data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Next, let us check the footage from Babahl's security camera.
Kay:
I hope it shows us something good. ...Phooey. There wasn't a single sign of a suspicious person or anything.
Edgeworth:
That, right there, is the contradiction.
Kay:
Huh? Did I miss something?
Edgeworth:
You didn't miss anything... because there was nothing to miss. However, what IS missing is the image of Mr. Coachen entering his own country.
Kay:
But wasn't his body found in Babahl?
Edgeworth:
It would appear that the true face of our final puzzle has finally revealed itself.
Investigation Complete
Edgeworth:
! Ambassador Alba...!
Alba:
I thought I had asked for you and your group to vacate the premises, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Actually, I thought I should let you know that this theater sits on my country's soil.
Alba:
You've had your fun, and I've enjoyed our little game. I dare say that you've even achieved a new high score. However, once you've recorded a score, that same game can never be played again. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Your game is done, and it's game over.
Edgeworth:
No...!
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Where do you think you're going at this time of night?
Alba:
After admitting to my crime, I was overcome with regret. So I am heading to the airport now to return home.
Edgeworth:
I'm afraid I can't let you do that. There are still too many issues we need to discuss with you.
Alba:
You can't stop me, Mr. Edgeworth, and you know it.
Edgeworth:
Arngh...!
Hold it!
Palaeno:
Please, may I have a little bit of your time, Ambassador Alba?
Alba:
Ambassador Palaeno...!
Palaeno:
Even just a teeny-tiny bit is fine with me. The already strained relationship between our countries is in a precarious situation, you know.
Alba:
.........Very well. If you insist. I will play just one more round with them, and see what they want. .........Not that they'll get any farther.
Edgeworth:
Ambassador Palaeno...
Palaeno:
Mr. Edgeworth... All I wish for is the normalization of relationships between our two countries. But there is one person standing in the way of that dream. I... I believe in you. You'll do what's right.
Edgeworth:
...Thank you for your vote of confidence.
Alba:
Now then, what was it you wanted to ask me about? I do have a flight to catch, after all. So I'm afraid I'm going to have to limit you to just one question.
Edgeworth:
That's more than enough, because I only have one question anyway. I want to hear your alibi, about how you couldn't have killed Mr. Manny Coachen!
Alba:
Ho! I see... You seem to have a good hand this time around. This should be fun.
Edgeworth:
(This really is the very last chance we have to bring him down. I won't allow even an atom-sized contradiction to slip by!)
-- Ambassador Alba's Alibi --
Alba:
Frankly, I still don't understand why I am being placed under suspicion here.
Under your hypothetical scenario, Mr. Coachen and I were fellow smugglers.
But to get to the point, I was in Allebahst the whole time.
So, it's simply not possible for me to have killed him in Babahl. That is my alibi.
Edgeworth:
...So that is your alibi?
Alba:
That is correct. It's simply not possible for me to have committed a crime in Babahl. Now that we cleared that up, I'd appreciate it if you would move out of my way.
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I said, "Hold it!"
Alba:
What is it this time? I thought I told you I'd only allow one question.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... You did, but you still have yet to really answer my one question.
Alba:
What...?
Edgeworth:
Until you tell us the truth... I will refuse to budge an inch from where I'm standing!
Alba:
Hmph... Very well. I'll play with you just a little longer.
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! As my subordinate, and representative of this country's prosecutors... ...you are forbidden to lose!
Edgeworth:
Of course. That is something I've understood from the start.
Kay:
...That guy's the one who... ordered my father killed, isn't he?
Edgeworth:
...Yes, I believe so.
Kay:
The goal of the first Yatagarasu was the capture of the smuggling ring's leader. My father and Uncle Badd... Their legacy will live on... through me! So that's why we've just got to catch him, OK!?
Edgeworth:
We will. I promise. Now, Ambassador Alba, let's have at the truth now, shall we!?
Alba:
Heh heh heh... No matter how many times you ask, my answer remains the same.
Rebuttal
-- Ambassador Alba's Alibi --
Alba:
Frankly, I still don't understand why I am being placed under suspicion here.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Being the leader of a smuggling ring while taking on the duties of ambassadorship... Don't you think that the combination is more than enough reason for suspicion? Then there is the matter of the crossbow arrows and the Primidux Statues...
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
All of that is nothing more than your flights of fancy.
Edgeworth:
What do you mean by that!?
Alba:
Under your hypothetical scenario, Mr. Coachen and I were fellow smugglers.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
It's not hypothesis! Earlier, we proved it to be what happened.
Alba:
Ha ha ha... Well, let's leave that to one side for now. Because it doesn't change the fact that I have no motive.
Edgeworth:
Oh? So you really had no reason to kill Mr. Coachen?
Alba:
If you want to suppose I had one, then why not. I'll indulge you. After all, this is nothing more than a silly game to me.
Edgeworth:
Even if that's how you see things, I'd appreciate it if you would take me seriously.
Alba:
Gwah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haaa! Ahem, I'm sorry. I suppose you are in a bit of a pickle. Very well. A game is no fun if the playing field isn't level. Therefore, I formally claim that I had no motive to kill. Now, let's see you disprove it.
Edgeworth:
(How can he stand there looking proud when he knows he killed another human being? Well, I'm not going to stand by and just watch him get away with his crimes!)
Add statement:
"In that case, what motive would I have had to kill my co-conspirator?"
Alba:
In that case, what motive would I have had to kill my co-conspirator?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you serious that just because you were partners, that you had no motive to kill?
Alba:
I'm only following your hypothetical scenario to its logical conclusion. Haaa ha ha ha ha!
Kay:
Looks like he's not going to admit it himself that he was in leagues with Mr. Coachen.
Edgeworth:
I suppose not. But I do know his relation to the smuggling ring, and to Mr. Coachen.
Kay:
You mean, he's the ringleader, and that Mr. Coachen was his subordinate, right?
Edgeworth:
Correct, but I know more than just that. Ms. von Karma, I'm sure you remember the safe in Mr. Coachen's office, correct?
Franziska:
Yes... The safe had two compartments to it, didn't it?
Edgeworth:
Yes, and why do you think those stolen goods were being stored in Mr. Coachen's office? Could it be because he was trying to cheat Ambassador Alba behind his back?
Franziska:
So Mr. Coachen didn't turn the goods over, but decided instead to keep them for himself? I suppose that's possible.
Edgeworth:
Hmm, it seems to me that both men were only concerned with their own wealth and wellbeing.
Kay:
Then that means that maybe they didn't have a trusting relationship after all.
Edgeworth:
What Ambassador Alba had to gain... I believe that is his motive for killing Mr. Coachen!
Alba:
...What are you people whispering about amongst yourselves over there?
Edgeworth:
Ah, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. Now then, let's continue with your testimony!
Present DeMasque II's Note
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"If you want to know, I believe you did have a motive to kill."
Alba:
But to get to the point, I was in Allebahst the whole time.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
And what exactly did you do while you were in Allebahst?
Alba:
I had a meeting with the Steel Samurai, and then I arranged a few files. Around that time, that thief who was sneaking in took me by surprise.
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Are you saying that it was DeMasque II that made the first move!?
Alba:
Yes, and it was after I was attacked that I hit him on the head with the Primidux Statue. Unfortunately, he died from the blow, but it was an act of justified self-defense.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Calling it that doesn't cover up what you really did!
Alba:
Ha ha ha ha ha. Cover up? No, my boy, I'm not covering up anything; I'm telling the truth!
Franziska:
You weren't planning to admit to it, which is why you tried to frame the Steel Samurai. If you weren't an ambassador, I'd be letting my whip fly loose on you right now...!
Alba:
I am terribly sorry that I didn't clean up the body better, but I am a busy man. I had a speech to give in the rose garden after that, you know.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Yet despite that, you still had time to kill Mr. Coachen, didn't you?
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
Heh heh heh... Man is evil, and I'm sure you are familiar with the facts, but... ...Mr. Coachen was killed in Babahl while I was all the way in Allebahst.
Alba:
So, it's simply not possible for me to have killed him in Babahl. That is my alibi.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You insist that it's not possible for you to have killed Mr. Coachen in Babahl... ...and you are correct.
Alba:
Oh? I thought you would put up a bit more of a flight, but if you must concede to me...
Edgeworth:
The only thing I am conceding is that it's not possible for you to kill him in Babahl. I am NOT conceding that your alibi is the truth!
Alba:
Oh... I see. However, no matter how you try, know that you can't crush my alibi.
Edgeworth:
...Hmph. You would be wise not to underestimate a prosecutor of this country.
Alba:
...Heh, we'll see about that.
Edgeworth:
So Mr. Coachen was a "friend" of Ambassador Alba...
Kay:
If that's true, then why did the ambassador kill him? It's not like in the case of my father where he ordered someone to do it...
Franziska:
The problem we have here is we don't know what their exact relationship was.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. If they had complete trust in each other, then there is no motive for murder. (However, both men were very selfish, and I believe that is from where his motive arose.)
Edgeworth:
If you want to know, I believe you did have a motive to kill. It was because Mr. Coachen had betrayed you. But you had your own reason, too. Namely, you wanted to pin the smuggling all on him. Evil begets evil, and because you were trying to test each other, it turned into this mess!
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
I don't believe this. You have a bad penchant for telling tall tales, Mr. Prosecutor. And if you're not, then I suppose you have some proof to support your argument?
Edgeworth:
I never use guesswork in moving my cases forward. It has been proven that this note was written by Mr. Coachen's hand. Shall we take a look at it? The content of the note is a request calling for the theft of Allebahst's Primidux Statue.
Alba:
...Hmph.
Edgeworth:
By killing him and pushing all of the guilt for the smuggling onto him, you walk away spotless. I believe you understand what I'm driving at. You had more than a few reasons to kill him.
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
Are you finished with your hypothesizing?
Edgeworth:
Excuse me?
Alba:
Let's suppose I did have a motive. Even so, a motive or a thought alone can't kill. Isn't that right?
Edgeworth:
(I didn't expect him to resort to playing the semantics game with me... It appears that this is where the real battle will begin...!)
Alba:
Now then, if you will excuse me...
Edgeworth:
Wait--!? What!?
Alba:
I told you at the very beginning, didn't I? You only get one question.
Edgeworth:
Arngh.........!
Palaeno:
...Ambassador Alba, if you could please give us just a little bit more of your time. It doesn't matter what kind of man Manny was, he was my subordinate. Which is why I would like for us to figure out the real cause of his death.
Alba:
That is something for Babahl to figure out, and something to which I have no relation to.
Palaeno:
.........!
Edgeworth:
(Now he's even turning down a request from Ambassador Palaeno...!)
Palaeno:
I'm very sorry, but it seems that now even my voice falls on deaf ears.
Franziska:
There is no need for you to apologize, Ambassador Palaeno.
Edgeworth:
Gnrgh! (We must find some way to stop him from leaving!)
Alba:
It seems there are no further objections. In that case, please allow me to return home.
Hold it!
Kay:
Hold it right there, Ambassador Alba!
Edgeworth:
K-Kay...?
Kay:
Like I said, Mr. Edgeworth... The Yatagarasu's legacy will live on through me!
Edgeworth:
Yes, but how do you suggest we stop him from leaving?
Kay:
You just leave that to me! Ambassador Alba, do you recognize this?
Alba:
No, and why should I recognize that tattered old organizer?
Edgeworth:
(Wait... Where have I seen that before...?)
Kay:
That is a clue my father, Byrne Faraday, left for us.
Alba:
Did you say, "Byrne Faraday"?
Franziska:
Mr. Faraday's organizer... Don't tell me this is the one from the second KG-8 Incident?
Edgeworth:
The one in which he wrote about the Yatagarasu's Key!?
Alba:
!
Kay:
Yes. This organizer belonged to the prosecutor you had Ms. Yew kill seven years ago.
Alba:
Hmph. I have no idea what you are talking about. You say that like it was related to me.
Kay:
Inside this organizer, he wrote up every detail of every evil thing you did.
Alba:
What an amusing little girl you are, But that sort of trickery won't work on me.
Kay:
If you won't believe me, then take a look at this!
Alba:
And what is that toy there? .........! That's...!
Kay:
This thievery device was used by the Yatagarasu, or rather, by my father.
Alba:
..................
Kay:
Seven years ago, he used this when he snuck into this embassy.
Alba:
...What...?
Kay:
These two pieces of evidence that hold information the Yatagarasu dug up on you... If you go home now, I won't hesitate to send it all to Allebahst, right behind you.
Alba:
Little girl, get to the point.
Kay:
I want you to go up against Mr. Edgeworth one more time. If you win, then I'll hand over these two pieces of evidence.
Alba:
Yatagarasu...! Ever the thorn in my side.........!
Edgeworth:
Kay, does that organizer really contain any information on his dirty dealings?
Kay:
It's nothing case-breaking, really.
Edgeworth:
Ah, then it was just a bluff.
Kay:
Even if it was, we still can't let all the info my father and Uncle Badd found go to waste! Plus, just the existence of Little Thief is troublesome enough for him.
Franziska:
Those two pieces... Aren't they keepsakes of your father?
Kay:
It's OK! I believe in Mr. Edgeworth! He'll come out on top in the end!
Edgeworth:
Kay...
Kay:
When the going gets tough... someone's gotta be there to put the wind back in your sails!
Franziska:
After all this time, you're still quite the feisty one. I appluad your powerful nature. I refuse to lose this, too. Ambassador Alba! You won't be returning home until you give us further testimony!
Alba:
How dare you all... Barring a person like me...!
Edgeworth:
Ambassador Alba, your testimony, if you please.
Alba:
Gnrk............! Alright, but this is the absolute last. Then, even if you use all the power of Ambassador Palaeno's office, you won't stop me!
Edgeworth:
(I can't let this opportunity Kay has created for me go to waste!)
-- Alba's Alibi, Pt. 2 --
Alba:
The last time I met with Mr. Coachen was here at the Theatrum Neutralis.
After that, I was in Allebahst the rest of the time, as I stated earlier.
In any case, I did not see Mr. Coachen again after that.
So you see, there is no time span in which I could've killed him. Wouldn't you agree?
Alba:
Now, since you people were practically begging, I'll allow you to question me.
Kay:
...What an arrogant old man!
Edgeworth:
Yes, but no matter. We can't allow this chance to escape us!
Alba:
I will warn you though, you've reached the end of my patience. Waste my time with any insane questions, and you will be punished.
Edgeworth:
.........! So any needless pressing or presenting will cost more to our case?
Franziska:
In that case, the only thing you can do is to present the correct evidence. Understood?
Edgeworth:
.........Of course. I don't intend to let him intimidate me! (I know Mr. Coachen was killed before he returned to Babahl. In which case, there is only one statement to which I need to present the evidence!)

I like Steel Samurai Daddy, so I asked for him to be at the event.

I guess he's not lying about being in Allebahst the whole time.
Edgeworth:
Yes, as long as he is willing to admit to DeMasque II's murder, then I suppose so.
Kay:
But he keeps saying that it was justified self-defense... Oh! I get it! OK, so what if I were to pretend being all hollow and sunken... ...and then I run into a klutzy person? Could I call that self-defense?
Edgeworth:
That's not self-defense; that's just being careless.

That's correct. I'm an incredibly busy man, you know. So it's more likely that Mr. Coachen ran into Ambassador Palaeno.
Edgeworth:
Even now, you would push his murder on to someone else...!?
Palaeno:
How dare you!? Saying that I would kill Manny!
Franziska:
Ambassador Alba! I demand that you refrain from making baseless conjectures!
Alba:
I was merely offering a possibility. No, this won't do... I can already see this is turning into an international incident.

Yes, because I was in the theater watching the stage show.
Kay:
Hey, Mr. Edgeworth? Do you remember seeing him sitting in the audience?
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but I don't remember anything outside of what was going on on-stage.
Franziska:
You shouldn't have been so focused on the show, and paid attention to your surroundings!
Palaeno:
Mr. Edgeworth... It is a fact that Ambassador Alba came to the theater. But I guess you didn't know that because you didn't see him at the Steel Samurai show.
Edgeworth:
Well, I do recall that he and you had a photo shoot with the Steel Samurai...

Edgeworth:
Amazing. Diplomats really do know how to craft answers that don't answer anything.
Kay:
So if the only place he met the victim was at this theater... ...then when was he killed?
Edgeworth:
We know that Mr. Coachen didn't return to Babahl alive. Which means that the only time he could've been killed is when they were both there.
Kay:
And that means that he was planning to kill Mr. Coachen from the start.
Edgeworth:
I'd like you to take a look at this picture.
Alba:
It's a rather nice picture, isn't it? It was to commemorate the restoration of relations between our nations.
Edgeworth:
Oh, it's commemorative, alright. One that captures the proof I need to show that it was you who committed the murder.
Alba:
Come again?
Edgeworth:
This is the knife that killed Mr. Coachen.
Alba:
!
Edgeworth:
I see you recognize it, as well you should, for it was you who brought it to this theater. You hid it in among the flowers you were to give to the Steel Samurai! Meaning that you killed Manny Coachen here, at the theater!

Edgeworth:

Get out of my way. My plane is scheduled to take off soon.
Lang:
Sorry, but you're not going anywhere... Mr. Alba.
Alba:
I'm through playing games with you people. You can't touch me. If you do, it would spark an international incident, Agent Lang.
Lang:
.........Sorry, but no, it wouldn't.
Alba:
What?
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Good job holding the fort down here until I got back.
Edgeworth:
Hm...?
Lang:
So, Mr. Alba. Your diplomatic immunity... has just been revoked.
Alba:
What do you mean "revoked"? Spare me this nonsense and let me through.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "Before aiming for the throat, chew the neck shield off first." Interpol headquarters and the imperial household of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...took a while to get things rolling, but they finally move on it.
Alba:
The imperial household...? You...! What have you done!?
Lang:
You have been relieved of your duties as ambassador, Mr. Alba.
Alba:
Wh...
Edgeworth:
Wh...
Franziska:
Wh...
Alba:
Whhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Lang:
Effective today, effective right now! And you have Mr. Prosecutor's video tape to thank for this!
Kay:
The video the Yatagarasu protected...!?
Lang:
You can't be arrested simply because you're an ambassador? In that case, I thought I'd strip you of that title. You underestimated me, a descendant of the founder of detainment philosophy, Lang Zi. Four thousand years of deeply entrenched connections and networks around the world... ...have really paid off.
Alba:
It can't be... I don't believe this... My ambassadorship... has been revoked.........!?
Lang:
Haa ha ha ha! Looks like you're finally coming to grips with your new standing.
Kay:
Whoo-hoo! Looks like he's turned docile again!
Edgeworth:
He's probably in shock from the loss of his "shield".
Franziska:
Hmph... What a shame. I had so wanted to use my whip on him!
Alba:
Why is this happening to me? I'm just a hard-working, honest ambassador...

Lang:
Heh, I'd expected no less from you, the boss of the smuggling ring. Well, the rest is up to you, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
Understood!
Alba:
Heh heh heh heh... You say that I killed Mr. Coachen in the theater. But even if it's true that there was a knife in my bouquet... ...I left that bouquet in the theater. So anyone could've taken it out from there and used it, right? Besides, the claim that he was killed here itself is odd. After all, wasn't his body discovered in Babahl? Are you claiming that I carried his body all the way over there? Hmph, preposterous!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I'll be the one to prove whether it's preposterous or not.
Alba:
Gnrk...!
Edgeworth:
Ex-Ambassador Alba, are you ready? Because this is no game. This is war!

Besides, Mr. Coachen's body was discovered in Babahl, right?
There is no way for me to have transported his body from the theater to Babahl!
Alba:
Look, don't you think you've had enough fun with me? You've already stolen my ambassadorship from me. Would you have me surrender, too?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
You have no plans to ever return to this country, isn't that right?
Alba:
.........!
Lang:
Did you know that a bunch of your subordinates are seeking asylum because of you!?
Alba:
...Ha ha ha. As if I care,
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! Boot this guy out of the embassy, and we can finally end everything.
Edgeworth:
I know, and I will give it my all to see that he leaves in handcuffs. Without the title of "ambassador", he is just another witness!
Franziska:
Yes... Just another witness.

I allowed some of my trusted subordinates to handle them. It could've been my secretary.

Alba:
That's quite an insult to me and my subordinates, and I'm afraid we can't have yet! It's very difficult to enter my embassy, as the guards always conduct a thorough check. If someone so much as makes an unnatural movement, it would arouse their suspicions.
Franziska:
Come to think of it, there wasn't anything unnatural about him in the footage.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:

"Actually, I do believe there was a way to transport the body out of the theater."
Edgeworth:
If we re-trace Mr. Alba's movements, we should find some hint to solving this case.
Kay:
Well, right after the Steel Samurai stage show, he went back to Allebahst, right?
Lang:
From there, he started preparing for his speech in the Allebahstian Embassy.
Franziska:
It DOES sound like it wasn't possible for him to have gone to the Babahlese Embassy.
Edgeworth:
(He couldn't have gone to Babahl, but the body didn't remain at the theater either. Is it possible that the body was temporarily taken to a different location first?)
Edgeworth:
Actually, I do believe there was a way to transport the body out of the theater. Perhaps you should give this a look!
Alba:
What is that supposed to be?
Edgeworth:
It's footage from a security camera that captured the state of the immigration area.
Alba:
Should I congratulate you on getting your hands on it?
Franziska:
Just letting you know that we're not the only ones watching your every movement.
Alba:
Hmph. Thank you for the warning.

Now, if you could take a good look at this section here. This lump here inside the pushcart... Do you know what's causing it?
Alba:
Should I? Because I don't.

Hmph, in that case, allow me to enlighten you. This is the cause of the unnatural lump under the cloth in the pushcart!

Edgeworth:
Ack! (Arngh... I guess I was wrong...! Hmph... I'm getting ahead of myself. I can't allow him to rattle me. I must think calmly about this. It should be almost painfully obvious as to what was inside that pushcart...!)
Leads back to:
"This is the cause of the unnatural lump under the cloth in the pushcart!"
Alba:
Wh-What is the meaning of showing me that...!?
Edgeworth:
It's to say that the unnatural bulge in the pushcart is Mr. Coachen's body. You had the Steel Samurai wheel his body away from the real crime scene!
Alba:
Gahahahahahaha! What a guess! But I wonder if you have any evidence to support it?
Edgeworth:
I admit that for now, it is but a hypothesis, however...!
Alba:
Ha ha ha... If you can't prove it, then I'm afraid I must be on my way. I don't have any more time to play with you people.

Gumshoe:
Sorry I took so long, Mr. Edgeworth, siiiiiiiir!
Kay:
Gummy?
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Is that the Steel Samurai's pushcart?
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! I found it in the open-air stage area!
Edgeworth:
So that's where you went...
Gumshoe:
The detective's spirit that pops left me with...! I thought I'd follow my gut and go with it, sir! So, Mr. Edgeworth!? Is this worth anything to the case?
Edgeworth:
Yes... It just might play a major role in solving this case, Detective! (But something isn't right. I thought that the entire Samurai Family... ...was in Allebahst.) Where exactly in the open-air stage area did you find this pushcart?
Gumshoe:
I found it just there at the edge of the stage, sir.
Edgeworth:
Oh? Well, let's leave that for now and examine the inside, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Examine pushcart
Edgeworth:
Steel Samurai Daddy used this pushcart to wheel the Iron Infant around.
Kay:
The Iron Infant is the Steel Samurai's and the Pink Princess's kid, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. He made an appearance at the end of the stage show. Heh... It was a rather fitting ending to the whole thing. (That the Steel Samurai was unwittingly forced to move the body is just unforgivable!)
Examine bloodstain
Edgeworth:
Hm...!?
Gumshoe:
It's... blood!
Edgeworth:
This must be Mr. Coachen's blood. Which only goes to prove that Mr. Coachen's body was indeed transported by this pushcart.
Leads to:
".................."
Alba:
..................
Edgeworth:
I believe you understand what this means, correct? You killed Mr. Coachen at this theater, and then placed his body inside the pushcart. And then... ...you forced to Steel Samurai to unwittingly move the body for you!
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
I forced him to move the body into Allebahst...!? What nonsense! Why would I bother to do such a thing?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You were scheduled to make a speech in Allebahst... ...meaning it was difficult for you to make a stop in Babahl. However, what if you moved the body to Allebahst? Because it was your embassy, you could keep an eye on it, and tamper with the evidence. And then you smuggled it out of Allebahst!
Alba:
N-Noooooooo!
Edgeworth:
If I can show how you moved the body from Allebahst and Babahl... ...then I win.
Alba:
But you can't! The security between the two countries is incredibly tight!
Edgeworth:
I'll be the one to judge whether I can or cannot prove it. And so I ask you to provide us with... ...testimony regarding your movements after your return to Allebahst!
Alba:
Grrrngh...!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth... Have you figured it out? Do you know how the body was moved...!?
Edgeworth:
To be honest, I have nothing to support my hypothesis at this time. However, I don't believe I've made a mistake in my logic up to this point. Which means.........!
Franziska:
There is no question that can't be answered, right?
Edgeworth:
(The Primidux Statue was smuggled successfully through a brief flight through the air. So why shouldn't there be an answer as to how the body was moved? Which means that there must be a logic flaw somewhere I can exploit!)
-- Movements in Allebahst --
Alba:
After I returned to Allebahst, I had my picture taken with the Steel Samurai, shaking hands.
Then, just as I was about to start my speech, the Yatagarasu appeared.
I feared for the national treasures, so I raced back to my office.
Edgeworth:
Is that all...?
Alba:
.........Yes, that's all.
Franziska:
It looks like you left out a few things... such as the murder of DeMasque II! Furthermore, you left out the part about meeting with me in your office!
Alba:
Ah, those trifling matters... I don't believe I need to speak of those things again. I do so hate to waste time.
Franziska:
What...!?

Heh heh heh... Do you really need me to answer that for you?

Wow! So you DO have a soft side after all!
Alba:
The pain of a bad hip... I suppose none of you can really understand how it feels.

But isn't that just because you're normally all hunched over?

Alba:
Ha ha ha. A most amusing joke. And how do you propose that I "set it up"?
Edgeworth:
If you really want to know, I can explain it in detail for you. You arranged the spotlights in the rose garden so that when you were to take the stage... ...the audience would see the Yatagarasu's "shadow".
Alba:
Oh? That is an interesting tale... Sadly, it has nothing to do with me.
Lang:
You...! What's it going to take for you to fess up to anything!?
Edgeworth:
Nngh...! Very well, then. Let's move on to a different question. After the Yatagarasu appeared, what was the state of the rose garden?

Everyone took refuge inside the embassy. I even helped with the effort. And then, once everyone was inside, well...

I don't want to keep on repeating this, however... ...upon my return, I had that stroke of bad luck and bumped into "Mask Man".
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
...And I don't want to keep on repeating this, either... ...but his name was "DeMasque II"!
Alba:
Hmph. Who cares what he was called!? By the time he got to the Primidux Statue that he was supposed to steal... ...it had already been swapped for the fake. Talk about an unlucky man... being bludgeoned to death with a fake statue! Heh heh heh...
Franziska:
...............
Kay:
Ms. von Karma is really letting her whip fly now!
Gumshoe:
Eeeeeek! I think the scary part is her silence while she's doing it.
Edgeworth:
She must be at the limit of her patience as well... (But physical attacks are meaningless here... Only evidence will suffice.)
Edgeworth:
Arngh! I can't find a single contradiction!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... He's totally dead on the inside! Just like a hollow tree!
Gumshoe:
You're the only one that can cut him down to size, Mr. Edgeworth, sir!
Edgeworth:
At this point in time, we lack the information require to fight back properly...!
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! You just say the word, and I'll get him talking for you.
Franziska:
Don't forget that we have plenty of ways to get him to talk.
Gumshoe:
We've got some real scary people on our side, huh, Kay?
Kay:
Well, I'm all ready to help out, Gummy! How about you!?
Gumshoe:
I can't believe even you're getting into this... In that case, I'm ready, too, sir!
Edgeworth:
Ack! Everyone please calm down! I-I'll think of something.
(Pressing all statements leads to:)
Edgeworth:
............Gnrk! (I... I can't find a single flaw in his argument! At this rate, I won't be able to prove that he is actually guilty of anything!)
Alba:
Are we finished here?
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! Can you not come up with how the body was moved to Babahl!?
Gumshoe:
Sir...!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Lang:
Grr... Even after proving so much... is he going to get away with it...!?
Edgeworth:
N...Nngh...! (Is this the end...?)
Hold it!
???:
It appears that we made it just in time...!
S.Samurai:
It would be a great honor if you allow us tyo be your allies in battle!
P.Princess:
Evil Magistrate! It is time for you to pay!
Kay:
It's... the Steel Samurai?
Larry:
No, you are mistaken! For I am... ...Steel Samurai Daddy! Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo! And this is... ...Pink Princess Mommy!
Oldbag:
Edgey-poooooooo!
Edgeworth:
Nrghhhooooooooooh! (The two people I wanted to see the least.........!) Laaaaaaaarryyyy...! What are you two doing here!?
Larry:
Way to show your gratitude, Edgey! We just wanted to help, yeesh! I'm gonna get the bad guy with a single thrust of my Samurai Spear...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Go away!
Oldbag:
How can you be so mean to us, Edgey-poo!? All three of us came to lend a hand, and this is how you treat us!?
Franziska:
Well, isn't this grand? And I see they managed to find the Iron Infant.
Edgeworth:
D-Does that really matter right now!?
Kay:
Hey...! Is it just me, or is the Iron Infant completely soaked?
Larry:
Hm? Oh, yeah. I found him in Babahl, but he was in the middle of the pool.
Edgeworth:
...Wait a second! Larry, go back to what you just said.
Larry:
Huh? Oh, umm... It appears that we made it...
Edgeworth:
Not that far back! Something about finding the Iron Infant in Babahl...? (And he found it in a pool? I don't recall there being one in Babahl...)
Larry:
Oh! THAT! Well, I was in Allebahst the whole time... ...so I have no idea how the Iron Infant wound up in Babahl! I thought I had lost him in the rose garden... ...but I guess maybe this cute kid can swim, huh?
Edgeworth:
Wait, what? Larry! You lost the Iron Infant in the rose garden? Are you sure about that?
Larry:
Yeah, I'm sure! But I found him in...
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
That's enough, Larry! (The Iron Infant that Larry lost managed to move between the two countries. Furthermore, the Iron Infant was found soaked in the middle of a pool? This is what I've been looking for; it's another smuggling route between the countries!) The key to the route the Iron Infant took to travel from Allebahst to Babahl is...
the Yatagarasu.
Edgeworth:
(Is it not the Yatagarasu? No, wait... As Ms. Yew was the Yatagarasu... ...it's very unlikely that the Yatagarasu is the key. In that case, how exactly was the Iron Infant smuggled across country lines...? This one thing is the only thing I can think of that can resolve the puzzle!)
Leads back to:
"The key to the route the Iron Infant took to travel from Allebahst to Babahl is..."
bilateral symmetry.
Leads to:
"(Ah, that's right. This embassy was built with bilateral symmetry in mind!)"
counterfeiting.
Edgeworth:
(In order to move the counterfeit bills that were printed in Babahl... ...someone must have made a secret route along which to transport it all. But wait... If there was such a route... ...Agent Lang and his men would've found it already during their investigation. In that case, there must be another secret smuggling route... ...and I must show the key to that other smuggling route!)
Leads back to:
"The key to the route the Iron Infant took to travel from Allebahst to Babahl is..."
Edgeworth:
(Ah, that's right. This embassy was built with bilateral symmetry in mind!) Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Y...Yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
There is a location I wish for you to examine posthaste! It is where I believe the route used to smuggle Mr. Coachen's body lies!
Gumshoe:
D-Does something like that really exist, sir!?
Edgeworth:
An embassy built on bilateral symmetry... meaning that this is where we need to examine!
Present area surrounded by wall and Babahlese Embassy
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Yes, sir! I'll be back before you know it!"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe... I would like for you to examine this location.
Gumshoe:
You got it, sir!
Gumshoe:
...I'm back, sir!
Edgeworth:
Good, now report.
Gumshoe:
Sorry, but... there wasn't anything there, sir...
Edgeworth:
Wh-What!? (I was wrong...!?)
Alba:
Hmph hmph hmph hmph hmph... What's wrong? You couldn't find anything there, could you? Not one of your precious "holes", huh?
Edgeworth:
(Arngh...! I need to think about this calmly and rationally. The Iron Infant that Larry lost managed to move between the two countries. Furthermore, the Iron Infant was found soaked in the middle of a pool. So the location that Detective Gumshoe should be investigating... ...is here!)
Leads back to:
"An embassy built on bilateral symmetry... meaning that this is where we need to examine!"
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! I'll be back before you know it!
Alba:
It's too late. It doesn't matter what you do, it's all a waste of time.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
You will stay here with us and wait.
Alba:
.........!
Edgeworth:
This is Edgeworth.
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! It's here, sir! This is a reservoir here, just like the rose garden!
Edgeworth:
Just as I suspected...!
Kay:
What is it?
Edgeworth:
The two sides of this embassy are mirror images of each other. Which means that there is also a pool at the corresponding location on the Babahlese side. Mr. Coachen's body was moved into Babahl through the pool in Allebahst!
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
Avoiding the topic with a vague answer like that is unbecoming of a prosecutor. If you don't mind, I'd like to see more physical proof, if you have any.
Edgeworth:
The Iron Infant is positively soaked in water. Why do you think that is? It's because he was fished of a pool, and not just any pool; it was the Babahlese one. I think it's pretty obvious at this point what must be true. The water reservoirs in the two courtyards are connected!
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
And where is your proof that the two sides are connected!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The proof is right there before your eyes; the half-drowned Iron Infant!
Alba:
Wh...!? Th......This blasted dooooooooooll!
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! I'm back! H-Hey... Don't tell me... you guys figured everything out without me?
Edgeworth:
We did, thanks to this hero of justice's son. Even if he is just a doll, he managed to help foil the villain.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Look, I don't want to say this, but... ...it's kinda unlikely that the body just happened to have passed on through to Babahl. This guy's a doll, and he's small, so I can believe it made it, but...
Edgeworth:
.........! (He has a point.)
Alba:
Heh... Heh heh heh. Yes, that's right. I'm glad someone here understands. Mr. Edgeworth, are you going to next propose that a dead body can swim through a pipe?
Lang:
You see, Mr. Prosecutor? Our chase after this man... ...is far from over!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang...!
Kay:
Why is he helping Mr. Alba out now?
Edgeworth:
He's not. He realized a flaw in my argument, and is helping to move the logic along. (In which case......... I should return the favor and find an answer!)
Lang:
And another thing! Mr. Coachen's body was found in his office in Babahl. So what happened to his body after it was transported to the open-air stage?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Mr. Alba had an accomplice in Babahl, remember?
Lang:
You mean... Shih-na, right?
Edgeworth:
With her there, you can see how it was possible to move the body up to the office.
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
Are you seriously claiming that she swam through the connecting pipe with the body?
Kay:
He's right. Ms. Shih-na would drown if she did that!
Edgeworth:
(It's hard to imagine that she swam through the connecting pipe...)
Alba:
It looks like your hypothesis about how the body was moved is still only half-baked. In the end, it's all just the befuddled musings of an accusatory man. Now then, I believe you should give up and allow me passage. Because, from the start, there was no feasible method of transporting the body!
Edgeworth:
What!?
Lang:
.........Mr. Prosecutor. Recall Shih-na's movements.
Edgeworth:
Nngh.........! (What was happening in the embassy around the time Ms. Shih-na was in Babahl...?)
Kay:
Ooh... if only there was a way to get rid of the water in the pool...
Edgeworth:
(Get rid of the water...? Aha! That's it!)
Alba:
Now, I believe this time we really are done, right?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Unfortunately for you, it's far from over, Mr. Alba!
Alba:
You are a most persistent man. Are you saying that you've thought of a way to move the body through the water?
Edgeworth:
Move the body through the water? That is completely unrelated to how it was done.
Alba:
Excuse me?
Edgeworth:
The reason I say that is because... there wasn't any water there at the time!
Lang:
What do you mean, "there wasn't any water"...?
Edgeworth:
Just what it sounds like. Tonight's events made it possible to drain the water, allowing the body to be moved!
Present Fires in Babahl
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Tonight, the Yatagarasu set fire to a variety of locations in the Babahlese Embassy."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Alba:
............ What is the meaning of this?
Kay:
What is that supposed to prove?
Edgeworth:
Yes! What is this supposed to be, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Me!? I, uh, have no idea, sir!
Alba:
Mr. Edgeworth, that question was directed at you.
Edgeworth:
(Arngh! It would appear that I presented the wrong piece of evidence.)
Alba:
It would seem that you didn't hear me just now, so let's try it again, shall we?
Edgeworth:
Alright, and I'll prove it to you with the evidence!
Leads back to:
"Tonight's events made it possible to drain the water, allowing the body to be moved!"
Edgeworth:
Tonight, the Yatagarasu set fire to a variety of locations in the Babahlese Embassy. In order to put the fires out, much of the reservoir's water was used. Of course, when the water was used, the reservoir's water level went down... If enough water was drained, the connecting pipe could be used to traverse the border!
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
Hmph... So what!? The water level went down? The reservoirs were connected? Does any of this matter? You can't prove any of this!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Pretending to be ignorant won't work with me. We both know what kind of situation we're in right now. Even in a game, there comes a critical, game-changing moment. A moment in which you hit a wall that you must overcome in order to beat the game.
Alba:
I haven't lost yet.
Edgeworth:
I've found the route you used to smuggle the body, and that route will lead to your defeat!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Even if all the water was used by the fire fighting effort... ...you still can't really call that a smuggling route.
Edgeworth:
.........Hmph. I know that.
Lang:
Ha ha ha! I should've figured that you would notice. Hey, Mr. Alba, how deep are those pools, anyway?
Alba:
Heh heh heh heh. I'll have you know those pools are extremely deep. And there are no ladders or footholds along the walls, either.
Lang:
It would be difficult for Shih-na to hold the body and climb up out of the pool...
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Ladders or footholds along the walls? There was no need for such things.
Alba:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
If one were to use a certain something, they could go up or down in the pool at will.
Lang:
Oh? It looks like you've got an answer already. Well? What are you waiting for, Mr. Prosecutor? Enlighten us already!
Edgeworth:
(The way in which Ms. Shih-na and the body were able to rise up to ground level... If there was a way to control the water level, that could be the way the body was moved!) This was used so that the body and Ms. Shih-na could move up and down in the pool!
Present Fountain Spouts
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Mr. Alba used the fountain spouts, in a manner of speaking."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This, Mr. Alba, is what you used!
Alba:
...I don't recall ever using that.
Lang:
...I don't think that's really applicable, do you, Mr. Prosecutor?
Franziska:
...I don't understand how you think at all, Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Arngh! (It would appear that I was wrong...) I beg your pardon... Please allow me to present you with another piece of evidence.
Leads back to:
"This was used so that the body and Ms. Shih-na could move up and down in the pool!"
Edgeworth:
Mr. Alba used the fountain spouts, in a manner of speaking.
Lang:
He used the fountain spouts...? How so?
Edgeworth:
The water level in the pools can be controlled by opening and closing the spouts. Ms. Shih-na and the body were lifted upward by their buoyancy in water. The fire on the Babahlese side, and the fire fighting effort... These were set in motion all for the sake of smuggling Mr. Coachen's body!
Alba:
.........Gnnnnnnrk!
Edgeworth:
Shall I show you where the final destination of my train of logic leads!? First, Mr. Alba closed the fountain spouts in advance, in preparation of things to come. Then, he took the pushcart that was brought to the rose garden... and pushed it, along with the Iron Infant and Mr. Coachen's body, into the pool. At this time, Ms. Shih-na was busy conveniently starting the first fire in Babahl. She then made for the open-air stage's pool to wait for the fire fighting effort to begin. When the firefighters used the water in that pool, the water level went down... ...and by the time the fire was put out, the pipe between the two pools was exposed! This is when she pushed the pushcart from Allebahst into Babahl. Once that was accomplished, Mr. Alba simply opened the fountain spouts once more... ...and the water level rose up to its original level, along with Ms. Shih-na and the body. After that, Ms. Shih-na used the pushcart to carry the body up to the secretariat's office. There is an elevator in the embassy, after all. So you see... ...even with her small frame, she could've easily transported Mr. Coachen's body. And that wraps up my thorough explanation of how the body was moved!
Alba:
Gnnn... Gnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooo!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Well, Ex-Ambassador Alba? What do you think? Not so untouchable without your precious extraterritorial rights to protect you, are you?
Kay:
I knew you could do it, Mr. Edgeworth! Way to fight back!
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
You accuse me of moving the body across country lines...! But when you get down to the nitty-gritty, you don't have what it takes to indict me!
Kay:
The "nitty-gritty"...? What does the old man want now?
Edgeworth:
Proof... I believe is what he seeks.
Alba:
Yes. Proof. Without any, who is to say whether or not any of what you said really happened?
Kay:
He wants proof? What are we going to do, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
There is no need to worry. I've had all the proof we need all along. (The body wasn't the only thing to do through the pools' connecting pipe tonight. Just as Detective Gumshoe found the pushcart in the open-air stage area... ...so, too, did I find one other item there. And that piece of evidence is what will prove that the pools were the smuggling route!) This was another thing that was smuggled over to Babahl's open-air stage area!
Present Pick
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...And what exactly is this?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is the defining piece of evidence that will prove my hypothesis!
Alba:
Hmph! I don't think it proves a single thing!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What!?
Alba:
I think it's about time we put an end to this ridiculous farce of a "trial". If I'm not mistaken, all you're doing is trying to trick me with psychological gimmicks.
Edgeworth:
Arrrrngh! (If I continue on like this, Mr. Alba will find a way to worm his way out of this! The body wasn't the only thing to do through the pools' connecting pipe tonight. There was something else that was brought from the rose garden... ...through the open-air stage, and into the secretariat's office along with the body. Just as Detective Gumshoe found the pushcart in the open-air stage area... ...there must be a reason as to why that other item was there as well!)
Leads back to:
"This was another thing that was smuggled over to Babahl's open-air stage area!"
Alba:
...And what exactly is this?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... You have no idea, do you? This little piece that I found on the Babahlese side will be your undoing.
Alba:
A guitar pick? Would you care to explain how that is going to "do me in", as it were?
Edgeworth:
Much to your chagrin, perhaps, but this is not a guitar pick.
Alba:
Wh...What...?
Edgeworth:
This is something I found at the open-air stage which was transported with the body. I naturally assumed that you would recognize it... since you took a photo with it, after all. But since you don't, allow me fill you in on what I found at the stage actually belongs to!
Present Allebahstian Knife
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Let us take a good look at the murder weapon that was used to kill Manny Coachen."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is what the fragment belongs to!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Don't you dare chicken out on me after we've come all this way!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! I demand that you show the correct piece of evidence now!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, sir! Do the ol' presenting thing proud and do it right!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Yes, yes, I understand. (It would appear that this evidence isn't enough to convince any of them...)
Alba:
Hmph! What's wrong? You seem to have alienated all of your friends.
Edgeworth:
Not quite. They're merely watching out for me. And pointing out to me which piece of evidence I should be presenting! I naturally assumed that you would recognize it... since you took a photo with it, after all.
Leads back to:
"But since you don't, allow me fill you in on what I found at the stage actually belongs to!"
Edgeworth:
Let us take a good look at the murder weapon that was used to kill Manny Coachen. On the handle of this knife, there is a beautifully blooming flower. However, it would appear that it's missing a single petal.
Alba:
Gnn...nnrrgh...
Edgeworth:
Now, let's see what happens when we try to fit this "pick" in that open slot.
Kay:
It's a perfect fit!
Edgeworth:
I assume that the petal must have fallen off of the flower during Mr. Coachen's murder. And then, it was accidentally placed into the pushcart along with Mr. Coachen's body.
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
Gnrrr... That's an interesting story, nothing more.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Oh, I assure you it's more than just a story. Because for some odd reason, this flower petal was wet when I found it.
Alba:
It was wet... you say...?
Edgeworth:
Yes, and the only place it could've gotten wet from is the open-air stage's pool! Now I ask you, how did a part of the weapon which was smuggled into the theater... ...wind up in the open-air stage area on the Babahlese side of the embassy? I don't think I need to waste any words explaining this, as this petal explains it all for me. It proves that someone went from the rose garden's pool on through into Babahl!
Alba:
Impossible!!!
Lang:
The people of Zheng Fa have been waiting to see you, face to face, Mr. Alba. I'll tell everyone back home we'll be there soon. You should be happy.
Alba:
I... This... Why!?
Edgeworth:
Why? It's a little late to be asking that question. You should've known from the very beginning... ...when you took your first life! No matter how you may plot, or how you may try to cover it all up... ...you can never hide from your crime and what you've done. Because we're here to see to it that justice is served to people like you.
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
You... can't call what you've given a "perfect argument"!
Edgeworth:
..................
Kay:
You know... ...I don't think this guy is going to ever admit to his wrongdoings, Mr. Edgeworth. Because he values himself above all else. People who can't be negotiated with or people who refuse to admit when they've lost... I don't believe those kinds of people really exist because everyone breaks eventually...
Edgeworth:
You're right. In that case, I have no choice but to use all of the evidence I have. I'll use it all until he breaks under the weight of his crimes! Mr. Alba, I request that you testify once more.
Edgeworth:
(This really will be... the end of the line...!)
To be continued.
March 15, 3:33 AMTheatrum NeutralisLobby
Edgeworth:
Mr. Alba, I request that you testify once more.
Alba:
As if there is anything else for me to testify about.
Edgeworth:
(I still have yet to fully prove that it was Mr. Alba who murdered Mr. Coachen...) Well... I would like to hear about your movements before the murder occurred. I wonder if you could tell us about what you did here at the Theatrum Neutralis?
Alba:
...Very well. I suppose I could tell you about that. Heh heh heh... Because about all I did was watch the Steel Samurai stage show.
Edgeworth:
Hmph, elaborating on even that alone is good enough for me. (The only way for me to place this man under arrest is to pinpoint the exact location... ...of where the murder took place, for that is the key to this investigation!)
-- The Steel Samurai's Show --
Alba:
I watched from the last row. The stage was well-lit, but it was dark out in the audience.
I swear I was there in the audience, but it's hard to prove that, I suppose.
I do remember the contents of the show very well, though. Is that proof enough for you?
Those moving scenes were seared into this old man's heart. I'll never forget them.
Edgeworth:
So you were in the theater proper, watching the Steel Samurai stage show, were you?
Alba:
Of course I was. I have a great fondness for the Steel Samurai.
Larry:
Heh heh! Yeah! I was pretty cool up there, wasn't I?
Edgeworth:
You're not the one who was "cool"! It's the Steel Samurai who is cool.
Kay:
Yeah, and the Steel Samurai's special finishing move today was really something, huh!?
Larry:
Hm? Hey, Edgeeeeey! Who is she!? Who is this super cute girl!?
Edgeworth:
(She's been standing here this whole time, and only NOW he notices her!?) Her name is Kay Faraday. ...And she's helping me in my investigation.
Kay:
Sorry I didn't get to introduce myself earlier, but better late than ever!
Larry:
Yeah! So, Kay! I'm Larry Buuuuuuuuutz!
Franziska:
Silence in the peanut gallery! There's no time for such trivialities at a time like this!
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor, this is the final battle, you got that?
Edgeworth:
I know. This is the end......... for that man there.
Lang:
Ha ha ha! Now that's the kind of thing I like to hear! I think I'll give trusting you a try, Mr. Prosecutor... or rather, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...!
Lang:
I leave this critical battle up to you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Have no fear. I will finish the job. (This really is the endgame. The time has come to expose every last one of Mr. Alba's lies!)
Rebuttal
-- The Steel Samurai's Show --
Alba:
I watched from the last row. The stage was well-lit, but it was dark out in the audience.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The last row? I should think that an ambassador would've had special seating reserved.
Alba:
I wanted my staff to enjoy the Steel Samurai's show as well. So I gave up all of the good seats for them. It was enough for me to simply see him.
Oldbag:
Hey! The Steel Samurai wasn't the only hero! Let's not forget about the Pink Princess here!
Alba:
My dear madam... ...if you continue to thrust about like that, your hip may begin to hurt again.
Oldbag:
Oh, my! Well, aren't you the considerate person when you want to be? But! This young butterfly is on the side of Edgey-poo. So you can spare me the flirtatious come-ons!
Alba:
............
Kay:
Wow! He's completely frozen!
Edgeworth:
In frustration, perhaps. I dare say she can be one rather trying opponent. In any case... Mr. Alba, can you actually prove to us that you were watching the show?
Alba:
I swear I was there in the audience, but it's hard to prove that, I suppose.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you admitting, then, that you have no way of proving to us that you were watching!?
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
Quiet! You buzz in my ear like a pesky little fly! If you don't wish to listen quietly until the end of what I have to say... ...then perhaps you should pack up and get out of my way!
Edgeworth:
Gnrk...!
Alba:
Hmph... I see that you're willing to be a bit more receptive now. While it's true that it may be difficult to prove that I was out in the audience...
Alba:
I do remember the contents of the show very well, though. Is that proof enough for you?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Well, I remember the contents of the show as well myself.
Alba:
...That's nice.
Edgeworth:
"That's nice"!?
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth, don't allow yourself to be riled up by him at this important juncture.
Edgeworth:
Nngh... I wasn't planning to let him...
Larry:
Well, if you ask me, I think I'M the biggest Steel Samurai expert around here! And didn't you think the climactic scene of today's show was just totally awesome!?
Alba:
Yes, I remember that well. And that spectacular special move! The way you delivered the final blow against the Evil Magistrate, "Early Summer Rain Jab"... Oh, that scene will live on in my heart forever.
Larry:
Is that how it went? Heh, I totally forgot about that!
Edgeworth:
How can you forget your own special moves!? That's the special attack that the Steel Samurai uses when he's using the Samurai Spear.
Alba:
Yes, and today was the first time they showed it off, was it not? If I hadn't watched the show, then how could I answer you with the name of the move?
Edgeworth:
I suppose you are correct, but if you could, please elaborate on this point for me.
Add statement:
"One of the scenes was the never-before-seen "Early Summer Rain Jab" move."
Alba:
One of the scenes was the never-before-seen "Early Summer Rain Jab" move.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
"Early Summer Rain Jab" was a move that was to be unveiled today.
Alba:
And because I saw that brand new special move, I believe it confirms my alibi.
Kay:
How sad. The only way he's got to protect himself is that he watched the Steel Samurai. I guess... this guy really has nothing else left...
Edgeworth:
Yes, and to avoid arrest, you can bet he'll say or do anything. But, with all of us here, there will be no escape for him!
Kay:
Yeah! We'll find a way to bring him to justice!
Edgeworth:
Now then, let us continue with your testimony, Mr. Alba.
Alba:
Hmph. Very well. The Steel Samurai's special move and the various other scenes...
Present Samurai Spear
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"The special move today was the "Early Summer Rain Jab"? Is that your final answer?"
Alba:
Those moving scenes were seared into this old man's heart. I'll never forget them.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I agree, today will be a day to remember. Especially when we finally make you pay for all the wrongs you've committed!
Alba:
What!?
Kay:
Hey! That's what the Steel Samurai says when he defeats the Evil Magistrate!
Larry:
Heh heh... Actually, that line was just something I ad-libbed!
Edgeworth:
You may act all surprised, but naturally, you remember this line, don't you?
Alba:
.........! Of course I do. I just now understand how the Evil Magistrate felt, that's all.
Edgeworth:
Then allow me to make you identify with the Evil Magistrate some more!
Kay:
Hey, then that makes you the Steel Samurai, huh?
Edgeworth:
Heh... Well, if you had to complete the analogy, I suppose then, yes. (And I do believe it's about time to bring the curtains down on this with a bang!)
Before adding new statement
Kay:
I wonder if Mr. Alba was really there watching the show?
Edgeworth:
I don't think so, because the only time he had to commit the murder was during the show. And the only time he could've placed the body into the pushcart... ...was during the scenes when the Iron Infant was not out on-stage.
Kay:
Then that means that by the end of the stage show... Are you saying that the body was already in the pushcary by then?
Larry:
No waaaaaaay! I-I... You mean, I was pushing a dead body around!? That you used me in such a foul manner... is unforgivable, Evil Magistrate!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Well put, Steel Samurai. And now, I will show to all those present... ...just who is the Evil Magistrate that the Steel Samurai must defeat!
After adding new statement
Edgeworth:
Kay and myself were also in the audience of the Steel Samurai stage show...
Kay:
...He's got nothing on the Jammin' Ninja, but he was still cool enough, I guess!
Larry:
Heh heh! Wasn't my brand new special finishing move totally rad!?
Edgeworth:
No, don't tell me! It was YOU who thought up the special move!?
Larry:
Yup! Umm... Now what was it again? "Extremely Silly Reign Jab!" ...Was that it? No, wait, it was "Stubble Breaking Chop!" ...That doesn't sound quite right.
Edgeworth:
How can you forget a move you came up with!? (The final piece to Mr. Alba's alibi is that he was watching the Steel Samurai's show. However, if he was busy killing Mr. Coachen, he should not have had the time to do so!)
Edgeworth:
The special move today was the "Early Summer Rain Jab"? Is that your final answer?
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
You little irritating gnat. Do you think you can trip me up by asking the same question over and over?
Edgeworth:
That was not my intention. Your testimony is more than sufficient. However, I believe it would be wise for you to take a look at this.
Alba:
The Samurai Spear? What about it?
Edgeworth:
This spear... actually never made it on-stage today.
Alba:
...E-Excuse me...?
Edgeworth:
Heh... Unfortunately for you, tonight's Steel Samurai... ...happened to be a goof of a young man with an abundance of useless hot-bloodness.
Larry:
?
Edgeworth:
Having said that, said useless man bent the spear during his rehearsal this evening. Kay, do you remember what the Steel Samurai's special move was tonight?
Kay:
It was the "Steel Samurai Sushi Slash"!
Alba:
...A...Aaaaaa...
Edgeworth:
Correct. Because he couldn't use the spear, a last-minute change was made. Had you been watching the show, you would've known the move that WAS used.
Alba:
...Gnrk...!
Edgeworth:
Quercus Alba! You didn't watch even a single minute of the Steel Samurai stage show tonight, did you!?
Alba:
G.........Gnnnn... Gnnnnraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Lang:
Aha! So if he wasn't watching the show tonight...
Franziska:
...Then it opens up the possibility that he was busy killing Mr. Coachen instead!
Alba:
..................
Edgeworth:
So where were you during the show? I demand an answer, now!
Alba:
..................Heh. Heh heh heh heh heh......... Ahaaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Edgeworth:
Just what is so funny!?
Alba:
You're so sloppy. And so are your conclusions. I still insist that I watched the show. Or most of it, in any case.
Edgeworth:
What do you mean by "most of it"...?
Alba:
Ah, you see, during the show, I left my seat for a spell to visit the bathroom. I assume that was when that dramatic scene was played out on-stage.
Gumshoe:
Th-That is the lousiest, lamest excuse I've ever heard in my life, pal!
Lang:
Arngh! Just because he got the name of the move wrong... ...we can't really use that as proof that he didn't watch the show at all!
Edgeworth:
Gnnnrk............!
Alba:
As a fan of the Steel Samurai, I had wanted to watch the entire show... Honest!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
As a "Steel Samurai fan"...? For someone who wasn't even in his seat for the climax of the show...! You have no right to call yourself a Steel Samurai fan, ever!
Hold it!
Kay:
Wh-Who was that just now?
Larry:
It would be I, young ladyyyyy!
Edgeworth:
Larry! What are you doing interrupting me like that!?
Larry:
Edgeeeeeey! Just hold for a second, I beg! You may never accept this old man as a Steel Samurai fan... ...but I totally think he's a Steel Samaniac!
Gumshoe:
Um, what exactly is a "Steel Samaniac", pal?
Franziska:
I believe he meant to say "Steel Samurai maniac".
Larry:
Yeah! And trust me, I know a real fan when I see one, because I'm the Steel Samurai!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I will never acknowledge you as the true Steel Samurai!
Kay:
What are you getting so worked up over, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Alba:
It appears that the real Steel Samurai recognizes me as a fan. As well he should, for I am a fan! It's not as though I missed the entire show. It was a most amazing show, filled with the spirit of the young and the young at heart.
Kay:
Hmph. The sarcasm dripping from his long, wooden nose couldn't run any ticker.
Edgeworth:
(Getting the name of the move wrong only proves that he didn't watch the last scene. What I really need here is something more definitive! Something that links Mr. Alba directly to the murder of Mr. Manny Coachen!)
Larry:
You know what, gramps? You're really something else!
Alba:
I'm honored to receive such praise from the Steel Samurai, but what is it for?
Larry:
Well, I was just wondering how you found out about the "Early Summer Rain Jab". That move is a bit of a secret that only a small portion of the staff know about.
Edgeworth:
(Wait, it was a secret...?) Larry! Wait, what did you just say!?
Larry:
Huh? Did I say something stupid again?
Edgeworth:
Did you say that the "Early Summer Rain Jab" was actually a secret...?
Larry:
Well, maybe I shouldn't have said "secret"... It's more like we only decided on the name of the move right before the start of the show.
Kay:
Right before?
Larry:
Yeah! The stage director was going nuts because we were supposed to debut the move! About 5 minutes before the show, we threw it up on the dressing room's white board. "Early Summer Rain Jab"! That's kinda how we decided the name of the move. But, by that time, I'd already bent the spear, so I guess the whole thing was kinda pointless.
Franziska:
All of you Steel Samurai actors are the same. The director has my complete sympathy.
Larry:
So basically, because we changed the move to the Sushi Slash... ...we kinda pretended that the Early Summer Rain Jab didn't exist at all! I mean, it'd be had if someone found out we'd changed the move, so we made it a secret.
Edgeworth:
(So basically, a gag order was issued for publicity's sake...)
Kay:
It almost makes the "Early Summer Rain Jab" sound like a lost art!
Larry:
Yeah, which is why I think most of the staff haven't even heard of the move.
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
Hold those lips of yours still...!
Larry:
What the heck, old man!?
Alba:
I've done nothing but listen, and from what I can tell, it's all very unrelated to the case. It's also very tedious and a pointless exercise in wasting time, much like a kids' show.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Alba. I believe the one who should be quiet now is you.
Alba:
How dare you!?
Edgeworth:
I suspect that you've already noticed... ...exactly what the very severe implications are in this man's testimony!
Alba:
Hah! So now you're trying to bully me, huh? There are no implications to be read into a behind-the-scenes story of a kids' show!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Don't even think about trying to slither your way out of this, Quercus Alba.
Edgeworth:
You were the one who said it yourself, that the name of the move was... ..."Early Summer Rain Jab". But that name was only decided upon right before the show was about to start.
Alba:
So? Just what are you driving at?
Lang:
That the name of the move you told us was never used in the show or said aloud!
Alba:
............
Edgeworth:
Now then, would you care to tell us about how you found out the name of that move?
Lang:
Because I can only think of one way you could've known...!
Edgeworth:
Quercus Alba! This is the only way you could've known the name of the special move!
You saw it.
Leads to:
"You knew the name because you saw it! You saw it on the dressing room's white board!"
You asked about it.
Edgeworth:
You knew the name because you asked about it! You asked a member of the staff, that is.
Lang:
Hey, now! Didn't that samurai say just a few seconds ago... ...that the people who knew were ordered to keep quiet about the move!?
Franziska:
I somehow doubt that he could've simply asked someone and gotten an answer.
Lang:
Besides, even if what you said were the case, what do we learn from that?
Edgeworth:
Not much, actually. Not if Mr. Alba had asked a staff member, I suppose.
Franziska:
..................
Edgeworth:
Aaah! (I was wrong...!?) Mr. Alba, would you care to tell us about how you found out the name of that move?
Leads back to:
"Because I can only think of one way you could've known...!"
You thought it up.
Edgeworth:
You knew the name because you thought it up! Therefore, it's only natural that you knew! You are the one who created the name of that move!
Alba:
..................
Lang:
..................
Franziska:
..................
Kay:
.........Mr. Edgeworth, somehow, I don't think that's it.
Alba:
Let's just leave it at that, since it clears everything up for me nice and neatly.
Lang:
Hey! What exactly did you find out by saying that, anyway?
Edgeworth:
Umm... Not much, actually.
Franziska:
Will you please take this seriously!?
Edgeworth:
Aaah! (I guess I made a mistake...!) Mr. Alba, would you care to tell us about how you found out the name of that move?
Leads back to:
"Because I can only think of one way you could've known...!"
Edgeworth:
You knew the name because you saw it! You saw it on the dressing room's white board!
Alba:
............!
Edgeworth:
The staff members who knew were keeping it a secret. So you couldn't have simply gone up to a staff member and asked. Which means that the only other option left is that you saw it on the white board.
Kay:
So, that means that Mr. Alba was in the waiting room at some point, right?
Gumshoe:
But what's the big deal, sir? I don't see what that means!
Edgeworth:
There is another piece of evidence that has a great deal to do with the dressing room. So we can't afford to let this slide! This is related to both the dressing room and to Mr. Coachen's murder!
Present Pushcart
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Mr. Alba used the fountain spouts, in a manner of speaking."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
There is a very close connection between this and the dressing room!
Alba:
And what sort of connection would that be?
Edgeworth:
It's... a bit difficult to recognize at first glance, however...
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! I only trust what I can see! And when it comes to evidence, I think everyone here agrees with me!
Edgeworth:
(Grr... It would appear that this piece of evidence was not what I was looking for.) Yes, well, this time I will present to you the real piece that will prove my point.
Leads back to:
"This is related to both the dressing room and to Mr. Coachen's murder!"
Edgeworth:
The pushcart that was used to move the body was right there in the dressing room! During the show, the pushcart awaited its turn to be pushed on-stage in the dressing room. And it was finally pushed there, along with the Iron Infant, in the last scene of the show. And then, right after the show ended, it went into Allebahst along with the Steel Samurai. Which means that the only time the killer could've placed the body inside the pushcart was... ...when the pushcart was in the dressing room backstage!
Kay:
So basically, the killer has to be someone who visited the dressing room during the show!
Edgeworth:
Precisely.
Alba:
.........Gnnraaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Kay:
Oh! But wait! What if, and this is just a "what if"...! What if the murder didn't take place in the dressing room?
Gumshoe:
Wh-What do you mean, Kay!?
Edgeworth:
I have to admit, she brings up a valid possibility. During the show, the dressing room was supposed to be devoid of people.
Lang:
Anyone going into the private dressing room would stand out like a sore thumb!
Franziska:
But despite that, the killer still managed to move the body with the pushcart.
Edgeworth:
Correct, and it is because of the set-up of the theater's dressing room... ...that it would be the ideal location for the murder of Manny Coachen!
Alba:
..................
Edgeworth:
Quercus Alba! During the show, you went down to the dressing room. And I want to know why!
Alba:
..................Yes. .........Yes, I was there. I went into... the dressing room.
Gumshoe:
I knew it! I'm placing you under arrest right now, pal! You got that!? ARREST!
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
Not so fast.
Gumshoe:
Wh-What is it now!?
Alba:
Heh heh heh heh. Don't I deserve a chance to explain myself?
Edgeworth:
Explain? What is there to explain!?
Alba:
I believe I told you earlier that I went to the bathroom. Well, I got lost when I did. I wanted to ask for directions but when I opened the dressing room door, no one was inside. And that's when I saw the name of the move on the white board.
Lang:
You punk! Still trying to get out of this...!?
Franziska:
Do you really think you can get away at this point...!?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't there anything you can do to stop him!?
Edgeworth:
(Nngh...! I don't have enough evidence on hand to do anything! I don't have the airtight evidence I need to put this man away for good. But if that's what I need, then perhaps...) Agent Lang! I believe an investigation of the dressing room in question is in order. It's possible that we may find new evidence there!
Gumshoe:
Yeah! If Mr. Edgeworth pokes around in there, I'm sure he'll find some new facts, pal!
Kay:
Ooh! And if we use Little Thief, we may even learn something from a re-creation!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
...We don't need to do any of that.
Kay:
What!? Wolfy!? How could you!?
Lang:
I'm not saying this to be mean. It's just that... we've already searched there. My men really are something else.
Franziska:
And they found nothing?
Lang:
There's only one thing I can say to you, sis, and it's that they found nothing. That's it.
Franziska:
I... guess you're right. If they had found something, they would've reported it to us.
Alba:
Heh heh heh heh heh. They couldn't find anything because there was nothing there to find.
Kay:
And if there is no info to feed into Little Thief, then I can't do much to help either.
Edgeworth:
(Is this the end? The murder took place in this theater, which is not protected under extraterritorial rights... ...and the fact that it was Mr. Alba himself who committed the murder... If I can't prove both statements to be true, Mr. Alba walks away a free man! Is there no other course of action left to us...!?)
Alba:
It would appear that your hand of cards has turned out to be a bust. Now if you will excuse me. Because of you people, I missed my flight. Now I must make haste to arrange for a new one...
Hold it!
Kay:
Wh-Who is it this time?
Oldbag:
Hold it right there, you whippersnappers!
Edgeworth:
Ack! First Larry, and now YOU!
Oldbag:
What is with that scary, mobster-like scowl on your face, Edgey-poo!? Don't treat me like I'm some sort of nuisance! I've been meaning to say this, but all of you keep talking about things I don't get at all! You're all leaving this lady in the sad, depressing, lonely dust that I'm about to cry in!
Edgeworth:
(Why did you have to speak up right at this instant...!?)
Oldbag:
But you know what, Edgey-poo!? Cheer up! Because I'm about to give you the most wonderful thing!
Edgeworth:
? The most "wonderful thing"...? From you...?
Oldbag:
It's so super special that I couldn't give it away to just anyone, you know! Ah, my special present of love to my sweet Edgey-poo... Are you ready!? ...Is this!
Edgeworth:
I-It's...!
Kay:
.........
Lang:
.........
Franziska:
.........
Gumshoe:
It's... a box of those "Samurai Dogs", right?
Oldbag:
Yes! Oh, Edgey-poo! Here, go on and eat one and you'll feel as right as rain.
Edgeworth:
.........
Kay:
.........
Lang:
.........
Franziska:
.........
Gumshoe:
.........
Alba:
Are we through here?
Oldbag:
...Why did everyone get so quiet all of a sudden!? Edgey-poooooooo! Tell me YOU understand the depths of this lady's love for you!!! I'm not one to hand out snacks willy-nilly, you know! No sir! The thought occurred to me that maybe it would be good if I fed you and made sure you were nice and full! One day, it's my dream to serve you some of my own home-made food! I mean, isn't it the desire of every woman to make sure that their beloved never goes hungry? And that's what I wanted to experience! I'll tell you one thing, though. A long time ago, they used to say that I could make the most delicious meal out of any ingredient you threw in front of me! Oh, I was a star in the kitchen back then, and I was
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Can't you do anything about her!?
Edgeworth:
(There is no power on Earth that can force THAT woman into silence!)
Oldbag:
But I'm so sick and tired of it! All you people do is look down on me! Even this box of "Samurai Dogs" played me for a fool! It had a special design on its fan, like the Japanese flag, so I thought it was special! But when I ate one, it tasted just like all the rest! Ooh, it made me so mad!
Edgeworth:
(Wait, a special box with a Hinomaru-like fan on it? I've never heard of such a piece of merchandise existing before. However, there it is The red rising sun on this fan is filled in... I-Is it possible!? Could it be...!?)
Edgeworth:
After the show, the Samurai Dogs were piled up on the dressing room floor. However, there is no such thing as a "Rising Sun Dog (Rising Sun Dogs - Taken from the dressing room, the fan's rising sun is filled in for some reason.)". This contradiction of facts between something that should not exist, and yet does... The rays from this rising sun may be just what we needed to point us in the right direction!
Franziska:
A present...?
Larry:
The studio big-wigs basically told us to play delivery boys. We were supposed to hand the Dogs off to the embassy people and tell them "hi". I had to pile them all into the pushcart just to move them (Samurai Dogs - Boxes of Samurai Dogs were sitting in the pushcart.) all!
Edgeworth:
I believe you understand what this means, correct? You killed Mr. Coachen at this theater, and then placed his body inside the pushcart (Body in the pushcart - The killer placed Coachen's body in the pushcart in the dressing room.). And then... ...you forced to Steel Samurai to unwittingly move the body for you!
Edgeworth:
It's time to piece the final pieces of this logic puzzle together. No matter how fragile or small the connections may be... ...once we've found them all, the way to the truth will be revealed!
Connect "Samurai Dogs" and "Body in the pushcart"
Leads to:
"(The killer used the pushcart to transport the body...)"
Edgeworth:
(The killer used the pushcart to transport the body... ...which means that they had to remove the Samurai Dogs from within first! Therefore, the Samurai Dogs that were piled up on the dressing room floor... ...were most likely taken out of the pushcart (Samurai Dogs were removed - Dogs were put on dressing room floor by the killer to make room for the body.) by the killer!)
Connect "Rising Sun Dogs" and "Samurai Dogs were removed"
Leads to:
"(That which should not exist, this box of Samurai Dogs with a hinomaru on it...)"
Edgeworth:
(That which should not exist, this box of Samurai Dogs with a hinomaru on it... If this red rising sun... ...was filled in when the killer was busy removing Dogs from the pushcart... ...then it's proof that the murder took place in the dressing room. As long as this red substance turns out to be what I believe it to be!)
Edgeworth:
...Wendy Oldbag. I thank you.
Oldbag:
!
Edgeworth:
What you have given to me is truly something very "special".
Oldbag:
E-Edgey-poooooooooooooo!
Gumshoe:
M-Mr. Edgeworth? Are you sure you're feeling OK, sir!?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Alba. As I suspected, you killed Mr. Coachen in the dressing room.
Alba:
How many times must I listen to you repeat yourself? Haven't you figured it out yet? You words are meaningless, worthless, and powerless. The only way I'm going to continue to cooperate with some definitive evidence.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. That arrogance, that self-confidence... You believe that you've erased every piece of evidence that could incriminate you. However! There remains one piece here, and it is what will put you away for good!
Alba:
Hah! You're bluffing!
Lang:
Oho... Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! Sounds like you finally found them. You finally found the fangs we need to go after this guy's jugular! So tell us, what about that box of Samurai Dogs is going to put the old man away!?
Edgeworth:
The trace evidence that will bring him down? Why, it's here of course!
Examine box
Edgeworth:
This part is just the same as all the rest of the boxes. But there is one spot in particular on this box that seems off. What exactly is it?
Examine red circle
Leads to:
"The box of Samurai Dogs with a rising sun fan on it... This should never have existed."
Edgeworth:
The box of Samurai Dogs with a rising sun fan on it... This should never have existed. So I want you all to take a good look at this red spot. It's a single drop of blood.
Kay:
Huh!?
Lang:
What!?
Alba:
Blood, you say...!?
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, I'd like this blood analyzed posthaste.
Lang:
I've got to admit, I'm a bit surprised! I can't believe we found blood in a place like this! Hey, you! Get this down to the lab, pronto!
Kay:
But why was there blood on that box to begin with?
Edgeworth:
If we think about the flow of the crime, I think the reason will become obvious. Larry, you said that you transported the "Samurai Dogs" with the pushcart, correct?
Larry:
Oh, umm, yeah! You have a great memory, Edgey! That pushcart was a bit too big for my son, you know what I mean? So to make sure everyone could see him, I had to pile some stuff in. I figured the Samurai Dogs were there, so I used them to fill up the cart.
Edgeworth:
If what Larry says is true, then what were the boxes doing on the floor?
Lang:
Ah, I see. The killer took them out in order to place the body in the pushcart!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. And that is when I believe the victim's blood found its way onto that box.
Lang:
But when my men investigated that room, not a single box of Samurai Dogs was in there... ...because embassy staff members had already confiscated them.
Edgeworth:
Yes. No doubt to hide the evidence of the murder.
Kay:
It's a good thing Ms. Oldbag managed to steal that one box before they got to them, huh? Looks like Ms. Oldbag also managed to put this Great Thief to shame!
Oldbag:
What a scandalous way to putting that! I didn't "steal"; I received it from myself!
Edgeworth:
Quercus Alba, I'd say this was one very fatal oversight on your part.
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
Heh heh heh heh. Sorry to rain on your little love-fest, however...
Edgeworth:
(How... How can he be so self-confident in a no-win situation for him like this?)
Alba:
Even if that blood turns out to belong to Mr. Coachen, then what?
Kay:
Heh! So, Mr. Edgeworth! It sounds like he's not ready to call it quits yet, huh!?
Edgeworth:
The sole piece of evidence that was left at the scene of the crime... That alone has shed light on a new fact. At the very least, we now have proof that the murder occurred in the dressing room.
Alba:
.........And? You say that like it means something.
Kay:
...Huh?
Forensics:
Excuse me, sirs!
Lang:
REPORT! What were the results of the analysis?
Forensics:
Sir! The analysis came back and confirmed that the red substance is blood.
Lang:
I knew it! With this, Quercus Alba...
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
Mr. Edgeworth, I wonder if you might humor my question?
Edgeworth:
Your question?
Alba:
The one from before, or have you forgotten? Even if that is Mr. Coachen's blood, what difference would it make?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Like we already told you. It proves that the crime scene was that dressing room.
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
But it doesn't prove that I am your killer, does it?
Lang:
Gnnnrk! That's... That's...
Edgeworth:
(Nngh...! He has a very good point. The blood on that box doesn't prove that Mr. Alba is the killer...!)
Kay:
Th-Then... this evidence... It's meaningless...!?
Gumshoe:
That can't be... We were so close, sir!
Alba:
Heh heh heh heh heh heh.
Kay:
I wanna smack that smug look off his face! Come on, there's gotta be something we can do!
Edgeworth:
(We finally found a solid piece of evidence! There must be something I can expose with it!) .............................. (A-Ack! I can't think of a single thing...!)
Alba:
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh. Heh heh heh heh heh heh. ...Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be on my way.
Hold it!
Alba:
Who was that!? It's too late. I won't allow anyone to stop me now!
Gumshoe:
I-It wasn't me, pal!
Larry:
And it wasn't me this time, either!
Oldbag:
It wasn't me either!
???:
I-It was meeeeee!
Edgeworth:
Why did you--!?
Forensics:
Umm... Because I haven't finished reporting everything to you yet, sir.
Edgeworth:
There's more...?
Lang:
What!? Hurry up and spit it out!
Forensics:
Y-Y-Yes, siiir! Th-That blood I mentioned... It's not of the same blood type as the victim's blood!
Lang:
Wh--!?
Kay:
No--!
Alba:
...!
Edgeworth:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Lang:
What do you mean it's "not the same type"!? You mean it's not the victim's blood!? If it isn't his... then who the hell's is it!?
Forensics:
I-I don't know, siiiiiiiiiir! All I know is that it's not the same blood type as the victim's, sir!
Kay:
What should we do now, Mr. Edgeworth!? I have no idea what's what anymore!
Edgeworth:
.........Neither do I.
Alba:
Heheheheheheheh. My, what an amusing turn of events!
Edgeworth:
!
Alba:
That blood drop proved something to be true alright -- namely, my words.
Edgeworth:
And which one of your words would that be?
Alba:
The ones where I said that your words are meaningless, worthless, and powerless. That blood has nothing to do with the murder investigation whatsoever! Need I remind you that the blood got onto that box long before it entered my embassy?
Kay:
Wh-What sort of nonsense--!?
Gumshoe:
Yeah! It's BLOOD, pal! There's no way it's not related to the murder!
Alba:
Heh heh. So you would like to believe. But what if someone preparing the Samurai Dogs had a small nosebleed? What then?
Gumshoe:
Gnrk! I-I guess that's possible...
Lang:
Damn it! Have we been wasting our time on a red herring?
Alba:
The blood doesn't belong to anyone connected to the case. That should be clue enough.
Lang:
Quercus Alba! You BASTARD!
Alba:
Silence! Don't you ever address me with such a filthy word again. I've wasted enough time here with you, and you have your answers. Now, let me through.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Alba! It doesn't matter where you run off to, you'll never escape me! Someday, I'll have the satisfaction of sinking my fangs into you. You'll see! And all of Interpol will be behind me, working to see to it that that day comes!
Alba:
Heh heh heh heh. Do you know what your words sound like to me? They sound like the whinings of a pathetic loser of a mutt.
Lang:
Arroooooooooooooooooooo!
Edgeworth:
(Is this really the extent of all that we can do? Is the blood really from someone completely unrelated to the case? Or is there another possibility? Someone else other than the victim? Just when I thought I had him backed into a corner, it is I who has been backed into one! In a situation like this... what would that man do...? What would he who can turn any desperate situation around do...? .........Turn it around...? That's it! I must turn my way of thinking around! It's not, "Whose blood is this?" It's, "Whose blood could get onto the box like this?" And if I think about it that way...! If the blood got onto the box when the body was being placed into the pushcart... ...then the owner of said blood must have been in the dressing room at the time! And there is only one person that could be!)
Alba:
Well, I must praise you for trying so hard. It's because of you kids that I was removed from center stage. ...and will be forced to live out the rest of my life in the shadows, unfortunately. But it's not a total loss, as the underworld will allow me more freedom than you'll ever know. Freedom like what the raven feels as it flies through the dark night sky. You can't lay a finger on me, not now or ever. The arm of the law is powerless before me!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hmph......... "Powerless", is it? I wouldn't be so sure about that if I were you.
Alba:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
Allow me to describe you in one word: pitiful.
Alba:
Pitiful...? How so?
Edgeworth:
Quercus Alba! Your wings were clipped long ago.
Alba:
.........!
Edgeworth:
And for someone who is trying to fly away on them without noticing that fact... ..."pitiful" is the perfect word to describe you!
Alba:
Hah! Mere words!
Kay:
What do you mean by "his wings are clipped", Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Just what you think it means, Kay. We had already caught him in our trap a while back. With an incredibly powerful, definitive piece of evidence!
Lang:
Hey, hey! Earth to Mr. Prosecutor! Care to speak in English!? What are you talking about? What piece of evidence?
Edgeworth:
The piece I speak of is of course... this drop of blood.
Franziska:
But we know that it's not from the victim! I don't see how it remains relevant to the case at all!
Edgeworth:
Ms. von Karma... I believe that is exactly why it's very important to the case. And the part that is the most important is the fact that it's not the victim's blood!
Alba:
............!
Edgeworth:
You're looking a little pale. Good, then I believe you are already aware of what I mean.
Lang:
Then, you know who the blood belongs to!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Of course I do. This piece of evidence is the irrefutable proof that will stop the killer in his tracks. The blood that soiled this box of Samurai Dogs belongs to this person!
Present Quercus Alba profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The blood of the rising sun on this box belongs to you, Quercus Alba!"
Present Manny Coachen profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
The blood belongs to Manny Coachen!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hey, didn't you hear the forensics guy, Mr. Prosecutor!? He said that blood isn't Mr. Coachen's, got it!?
Edgeworth:
Arnnngh! A-A simple slip of the tongue...!
Lang:
...Is that all? Then I guess this time you'll get it right, right? Who's the owner of that blood? You know the answer, don't you?
Leads back to:
"Hmph. Of course I do."
Present anyone else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
The blood belongs to this person!
Gumshoe:
What!? But why is that person's blood on there, sir!?
Edgeworth:
That's because! .........That's something I'll have to explain to you at a later date.
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, I know the answer; it's because you screwed up, that's why!
Edgeworth:
(Arngh! I suppose there's no fooling Agent Lang...)
Lang:
Now give me a real answer this time! Do you or do you not know whose blood it is?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Of course I know.
Leads back to:
"This piece of evidence is the irrefutable proof that will stop the killer in his tracks."
Edgeworth:
The blood of the rising sun on this box belongs to you, Quercus Alba!
Alba:
Grrr!
Franziska:
Wh--?
Lang:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Kay:
Why is HIS blood on the box of Samurai Dogs!? He's not even a victim!
Edgeworth:
The blood fell onto the box when Mr. Coachen's body was being loaded into the pushcart. At that time, the only two people in the dressing room were the victim and his killer.
Lang:
So that's what you mean! If the blood doesn't belong to the victim...
Franziska:
...Then there is only one other person it could belong to!
Edgeworth:
Yes, and that person is the murderer himself. That's the only logical conclusion.
Gumshoe:
But Mr. Coachen was the one who was stabbed, sir! Why would Mr. Alba have been the one who was bleeding?
Edgeworth:
What if during the murder, Mr. Coachen had fought back?
Franziska:
You mean, if before Mr. Alba could kill him, Mr. Coachen managed to wound Mr. Alba...
Edgeworth:
Yes, and I believe we have a piece of evidence that proves that he was bleeding then! (What is the piece of evidence that shows that Mr. Alba was probably bleeding at the time?)
Present Amb. Alba's Wound
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Mr. Alba, you bear on your body a great wound."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This piece shows that it's possible that Mr. Alba was bleeding at the time!
Alba:
I see... I suppose that does show us something. That you are quite possibly the most consummate liar of a prosecutor I've ever met!
Edgeworth:
(What!? Look who's calling who a liar!) Please excuse me. I will now show you the evidence you seek! Evidence that shows that Mr. Alba was counterattacked, and was bleeding because of it!
Leads back to:
"(What is the piece of evidence that shows that Mr. Alba was probably bleeding at the time?)"
Edgeworth:
Mr. Alba, you bear on your body a great wound.
Alba:
That was from when DeMasque II attacked me with a pair of scissors...
Kay:
Yeah, and that happened way after he was in the dressing room...!
Edgeworth:
Ah, but is that what really happened? You can manufacture a weapon by smearing blood on it, so I can't just accept that as fact. Shall we try a test, Mr. Alba, and see if the shape of your wound matches the scissors?
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
You really are something else, Mr. Edgeworth. You don't let a single thing slip you by, no matter how insignificant the possibility.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. You're one to talk Mr. Alba. You've managed to give the law the slip for ten years as the smuggling ring's leader. No matter the danger, you can hide every last ounce of fear and anxiety from everyone. You truly are a one-of-a-kind criminal.
Alba:
Objection!
Alba:
Heh heh heh heh. I am the master of my fear. However, to think that a person such as you... ...could miss such a large thing...
Edgeworth:
You believe I've overlooked something?
Alba:
You said that my wound was caused by Mr. Coachen. And that it was caused here in one of the theater's dressing rooms, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes, that is correct.
Alba:
I'd like to point out... that it's simply not possible. My wound is a stab wound, and one that could only have come from a blade. I wonder where you will propose that such a weapon came from?
Kay:
Ah! This theater was packed with security guards...
Franziska:
It would've been impossible for anyone to come into this area with a weapon of any sort!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Just as Mr. Alba was able to bring in the Allebahstian knife in a bouquet... ...there must have been some other way to sneak in a weapon of some sort!
Alba:
Ah, but as long as you can't prove what that other way is... ...all your talk about Mr. Coachen stabbing me is pure nonsense. So if that other way does exist, you'd better hurry and tell me now.
Edgeworth:
.........With pleasure.
Alba:
Wait, what!?
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence shows us how Mr. Coachen brought a weapon into this theater!
Present Yatagarasu's Key
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Among law enforcement, this piece is known as the Yatagarasu's Key."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Using this, Mr. Coachen was able to bring a weapon into the Theatrum Neutralis!
Alba:
Oh, really? Would you care to show me exactly how he did it using that?
Edgeworth:
Th-That's... (Curses. I can't think of a single way to use this...)
Franziska:
If you had no confidence in your answer...
Lang:
...You'd have been better off thinking a bit more before picking something, you idiot!
Edgeworth:
(Arngh! Their double team efforts are worse than Larry and that old lady!) Please excuse me. This time I will show you the evidence you desire to see.
Leads back to:
"This piece of evidence shows us how Mr. Coachen brought a weapon into this theater!"
Edgeworth:
Among law enforcement, this piece is known as the Yatagarasu's Key.
Alba:
Th-That key...!
Kay:
That's the key that my father stole from here seven years ago...!
Edgeworth:
And it is very unique, in that it is both a key and a knife. Meaning that under the guise of a key, it could've been easily brought into the theater!
Alba:
...Gnnrooooooooooooo!
Edgeworth:
You couldn't dispose of the knife that stabbed you... ...therefore, you wiped off the blood, and placed it back in Mr. Coachen's pocket! After all, the key itself opens the safe in his office. And inside that safe, there was a document about Cohdopian paper, signed by Mr. Coachen. In order to make it look like Mr. Coachen died as the leader of the smuggling ring... ...you had to make it so that the police were the ones who opened that office safe! Hmph. All that hard work to save yourself only served to destroy you in the end. Shall we try matching this knife's blade with your wound, Mr. Quercus Alba? ...And that is what some may call, the coup de grâce.
Alba:
............I-Impossible... You... You can't take me down! Swine! All of you! Especially Manny Coachen!!! This is all because of that man's betrayal! He sought to steal control of the smuggling ring from me by removing me as ambassador! Which is why he deserved to die while bearing the guilt for all of my crimes for me! That's why I sent out the Yatagarasu's card, and how this incident was born! Manny was supposed to be the smuggling ring's leader who was killed by the Yatagarasu! But! I had... yet another reason, yet another story that was supposed to play out! Manny's death was supposed to bring everything to a close! And I would've gotten away with it too if it wasn't for you meddling prosecutors!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Alba, I'm afraid there is one more question I forgot to ask.........
Alba:
..................
Edgeworth:
This country's, or Allebahst's: which country's court would you like to face first? Either way, it's game over for you.
Alba:
..................E... EdgeoooooooooEAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAaAaaAaaaaAaaaaaaaa! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
March 17, 11:21 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Gumshoe:
Whew! This is it, the big day! It's Mr. Alba's trial today!
Edgeworth:
And next week, he's scheduled to stand trial in his own country of Allebahst. Franziska is heading that one. I suspect she'll be serving a full course of whip lashes at it.
Gumshoe:
Having to face Ms. von Karma in court right after facing you, sir... *shudder* I don't even WANT to think of what that would be like. I caught a glimpse of Mr. Alba as he was being escorted into the courthouse... ...and boy, he looked about as glum as I do the day before I get my monthly paycheck! You know, I've been thinking... ...that flight attendant, and even Mr. Portsman were all Mr. Alba's secret agents.
Edgeworth:
Correct. That smuggling ring was the common thread between all of the incidents. Cammy Meele was to provide support during smuggling ops, using her job as an attendant. And Mr. Portsman was to manipulate trials related to the ring to end in their favor.
Gumshoe:
Oorrgh... iFly Airlines, and even the Prosecutor's Office... No one was safe from the smuggling ring, huh, sir!?
Edgeworth:
I suspect there are even more members of this ring spread throughout the world.
Gumshoe:
Yeah... It sounds like such a big op that I can't even begin to imagine what it's like! ..................
Edgeworth:
Hm? What is it, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Ah! Nothing! It's just... Well, come to think of it... ...Mr. Ernest Amano's trial is also scheduled for later today, sir...
Edgeworth:
I'm aware of that... Mr. Amano has been working with the smuggling ring now for over ten years. He used the Amano Group's various connections world-wide to assist the ring. But all of that has come to an end as his conglomerate is now undergoing harsh scrutiny. I owe Mr. Amano a debt of gratitude, but he must pay his debt to society.
Gumshoe:
Well, with the arrests of both Mr. Alba and Mr. Amano... ...I guess that about wraps up the KG-8 Incident as well, huh?
Edgeworth:
I suppose so. The real killer in the KG-8 Incident ten years ago was Manny Coachen. And seven years ago, the killer in the second KG-8 Incident was Mack Rell. Those two facts are the unshakable truth, however... ...it seems that a lot of effort was put into hiding these and other truths from us. And I will expose it all at the trials today.
Gumshoe:
You're solving cases left and right today, aren't you, sir!?
Edgeworth:
(Cece Yew and Deid Mann... Perhaps now, these two brave souls who tried to make the truth known can rest in peace.) ...By the way, I received some gifts from Ambassador Palaeno. Shrimp, crab, beef... I don't need any of these, so I'm giving them to you.
Gumshoe:
What!? Seriously, sir!? W-Wait... Actually, I don't think I want them anymore... The way you're holding them... Don't tell me they're just coupons, sir...
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe, have you not read the paper recently? Ever since the two countries became Cohdopia again, its economy has changed.
Gumshoe:
Really?
Edgeworth:
And it seems that Ambassador Palaeno has reaped a few benefits of his own from it. He has been announced as the official ambassador of the newly re-unified Cohdopia.
???:
Ah, but what a pity... Even though every item he sent is a "treasure", you don't seem all that interested. Well, if you don't want them... I can give them to my lovely assistant, Kay!
Gumshoe:
W-Wait! That's not what I said! So, umm, Mr. Edgeworth! Please let me have them, sir! Actually, come to think of it, where is Kay? How come she's still not here?
Kay:
Hey! You've gotta be more alert than that!
Gumshoe:
Eek!
Kay:
I can't believe you didn't notice I was even mimicking Mr. Edgeworth's voice for a bit!
Gumshoe:
I totally didn't notice you, or realize that voice was you!
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "Ferocious love blooms with each new Spring."
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... A pleasant surprise to see you here.
Lang:
It's been a long time since I set foot in a courthouse. But I wasn't going to miss... ...watching the guy who screwed up my country finally get what's coming to him. Well, that and something else. I want to see you in action in court.
Edgeworth:
Is that so, Agent Lang?
Lang:
We flushed out all of the counterfeit bills, so Zheng Fa is finally at peace again. And it's all thanks to you, so I just want to say... thanks.
Kay:
Wow, I never thought I'd see the day ol' Wolfy says thanks to Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
I should be the one thanking you, Agent Lang. If you hadn't negated Mr. Alba's extraterritorial rights... ...I would not have been able to bring him to trial. I believe the victory belongs to the both of us in this case.
Lang:
..................Tch. A shared victory, huh? Look, don't get me wrong; I'll still never forgive you prosecutors... ...and I have zero interest in that "truth" thing you talk about in court. I've always done things my own way, and that's not about to change, you got that?
Edgeworth:
Hmph, I see... Well, I believe you should follow your own creed when you do your job.
Lang:
Yeah, and if there's ever someone your precious "truth" can't catch... ...feel free to sit around and cry about it all you want. But as for me, I'm going to get that person no matter what!
Edgeworth:
Heh... Alright. It's about time for the trial to start. I will see you later.
Lang:
I'll be watching your performance from the gallery. I'm looking forward to this.
Gumshoe:
I prepared a whole ton of ticker tape for today's victory, sir!
Kay:
I'll help throw some around when Mr. Edgeworth wins!
Lang:
Ha ha ha. Hope you've get enough, because I'm going to go call my men up as well!
Edgeworth:
...A modest amount of ticker tape goes a long way!
Edgeworth:
The scene shifts to the courtroom, and the final act of this long tale begins. "The Legend of the Great Thief Yatagarasu". It's the story of those who chose to dedicate their lives to the pursuit of the truth. "Prosecutors are those who seek a guilty verdict for the defendants they meet... ...and to that end, you have no choice but to win by any means necessary." That creed was forced on me since I was very young... ...however, I no longer think that is all we prosecutors are. And that is because...
Edgeworth:
(Even though I've only been away from the courtroom for a short time... ...I feel as though... it's been a lifetime since I've set foot in one. And today, more than any other day, I feel the fight within me rising...)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Teneiro:
I am really in Mr. Edgeworth's debt for the other day! Thanks to him, I'm still free to serve in the friendly blue skies. Oh, so about my suitcases... ...I've been selling them on the internet, and they've become a real sensation! Thanks to the praise the art world has lavished on my work as being truly post-modern... ...the airline has chosen me to design their new line of iFly jumbo jets! Just think! Someday, you will be able to take a ride in my pink-walled, yellow-seated jet!
Lablanc:
Edgeworth? Ah, that rudeness of a rude man! Hmph! Because of him, my time and money is wasted. But more importantlier! I received a most fantastic treasure mostly! The Primidux Statue of the Principality of Cohdopia! It weights a bit light in my hands, but the Ambassador Palaeno was most generous.
Franziska:
We finally caught Agent Hicks's killer, and I was able to witness Mr. Alba's teary eyes. It feels good to finally bring everything to a close. I received another offer from Interpol to work another case in cooperation with them... ...however, the Cohdopian courts await. Cohdopia's air is supposed to be very fresh, so my whip should find new vigor there.
Meekins:
This little patrolman has been fired as of today, sir! I thought I was safe since we found the gun I had dropped... ...but I hadn't noticed that I had dropped my police badge, too! I guess what really broke the camel's back was that I couldn't find my badge. My little life has suddenly tripped into a dark, black hole, sir! I think I'll go the courthouse and file a complaint with Ruffles Man!
Ema:
I was actually hoping to talk with Mr. Edgeworth a bit more than I did... But I've got to get going and return to Europe. I've still got a long way to go and a lot of stuff to study there! Next time I help Mr. Edgeworth on a case, I'm going to do it as a real forensic scientist! I'm sure he's going to need all the help I can give him, scientifically!
Paups:
Because the kidnapping was staged, I was let off easy... ...but I won't be going outside much any time soon, but that's... really OK. The only prison I'm forever trapped in is the cage of love. The guard down at the detention center... well, when he's on guard duty... ...he has such a cold look in his eyes, just like that prosecutor... *ba-dump* Ah! Stop it, Lauren! When will you ever learn to stop being a prisoner of love...?
Judge:
It appears there are all sorts of drama that takes place outside of the courtroom. Since we judges are here day in and day out, I've only heard a few rumors, but... ...apparently, Mr. Edgeworth teamed up with a thief, and became a detective. Maybe I should team up with a bailiff and try to become a lawyer or something...?
Byrde:
Whew! I barely escaped death yet again!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but boy were we lucky to have Mr. Edgeworth help us out, huh!?
Byrde:
Yeah... but because I lost the key, I got fired from my security guard job.
Gumshoe:
Don't let it get you down, Maggey! You've still got me!
Byrde:
You're right, sir! I won't be sad! I'm going to pick myself up and get through this! I wonder what my next job should be...? Ooh, this is actually kind of fun!
Palaeno:
Why not come to Cohdopia for your Summer vacation!? We have coupons aplenty! Right now, our embassy is proud to present our "Let's Investigate a Murder!" show. Although, recreating that particular case has created a few small fires of its own. Then we had a few problems with the fire marshals... but the next event will be great! It will be an attraction entitled, "Capture the Yatagarasu!" Of course, I hope to enlist Kay's help in creating our latest attraction!
Larry:
I can't believe that Mindy ditched me and went to Japan... But it's OK! Because that's how I met Miharu! We're planning to go to Paris soon, and start a business! We're going to sell "Blue Ocean Dogs"! They'll sell like hot-cake hot dogs for sure! A blue hot dog in a blue bun, I guarantee it'll turn your tongue, and your face blue! I know I'm not really the type to work a lot, or at all really, but... Oh, so I noticed that I really haven't seen the guy in the blue suit at all recently. I wonder what's up? Well, the next time we meet, I'm gonna make him eat one of my Dogs!
Badd:
Today I gave testimony in court today... as a member of the Yatagarasu...
Lang:
Yo, Mr. Badd! You look well, all things considered. By the way, have you noticed that elements within the ring have begun moving?
Badd:
They're probably fighting over who should succeed... over who should be the next boss... .........Although, to be honest, I wish I could forget I'd ever heard of that smuggling ring.
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "Thoroughly bite the poisonous snake from head to tail!" No one runs afoul of the law and escapes this wolf's fangs! I'll get you all yet!
Badd:
.........Ah, youth. When did I become so old, I wonder...? I've begun noticing the gray hairs in my beard more. I'm thinking of retiring my mirror...
Oldbag:
I was the Pink Princess and the Pink Badger, all in the span of two days! Talk about busy! But it's alright, because I got a letter from my beloved Edgey-poo. "Please take care of your hip, and when you wish to speak, first take off your headpiece." ...What does he mean by that last statement!? It's not like I enjoy being under a head piece every time I see him! I've been an alien, and then some creepy, fuzzy, pink animal, and then I was the Pink Princess, a great hero of justice! But ever since I was a young maiden, I could be spotted wearing the most stylish hat on my head, although right around now, maybe it'd be more preferable to wear my own costume or something, but even that just sounds like a terrible idea...
March 17, 4:33 PMHigh Prosecutors' OfficesRoom 1202
Gumshoe:
Whooooop! I feel so much better now that the trial's over! And as always, your legal prowess was top-notch, sir!
Kay:
Yeah, and nothing beat the look on Mr. Alba's face when you revealed the ring's secrets! I was amazed! You're like a totally different person when you step into a courtroom!
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth is always ten times fiercer in court!
Edgeworth:
Based on the information Mr. Alba offered up, they've begun large scale operations... ...to clean up the rest of the ring, which I'm happy to leave to Franziska and Agent Lang.
Gumshoe:
So, what are your plans now, Kay?
Kay:
Hm? Oh, well, we've taken care of the creep who killed my father, so I'm not sure... Hey! I know! Maybe I'll just keep on being Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!
Gumshoe:
Are you still trying to steal my job, pal!?
Kay:
Just kidding, just kidding! I can't steal something so important to you, Gummy!
Gumshoe:
Phew, what a relief!
Edgeworth:
Kay?
Kay:
Yes?
Edgeworth:
Even after all that's happened, are you still planning to become a Great Thief?
Kay:
Of course! But I don't want to tarnish the legend of the noble Yatagarasu... ...so I'm going to hold off on doing anything until I make a tight 3-person team of my own!
Gumshoe:
A three-person team...?
Kay:
A three-person team of young beauties the same age as me, if possible!
Edgeworth:
(...With those criteria, I highly doubt you'll find the two other people you need.)
Kay:
My father chose to fight for the truth. I think that's what was so noble about him. So you see, Mr. Edgeworth... ...the only things I will ever steal... are the truths that have been hidden away. I'm going to work extra hard to make a world where the Yatagarasu isn't needed!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Let's both strive for such a future.
Kay:
Well, I guess it's time for me to get going.
Edgeworth:
I see.
Gumshoe:
Kay! Keep your chin up and stay strong, OK!? And don't be a stranger!
Kay:
Don't be worry! I'll be back! I'll be sure to break the lock on the window and sneak in!
Edgeworth:
If you could, I'd appreciate it if you came in through the building's front door...
Gumshoe:
It's OK, Mr. Edgeworth! The lock on my window at home has been broken for forever!
Kay:
Oh! One last thing before I go! Let's take a group picture, just the three of us!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, a commemorative photo! Every big case has to end with one!
Edgeworth:
..................No.
Kay:
Hey! Why not!?
Gumshoe:
Don't tell me you're camera shy, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
O-Of course not, Detective!
Kay:
Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm taking the picture now! Hey! Come back here!
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! You can't run away from this, sir!
Edgeworth:
Ack! Hey! Detective Gumshoe! S-Stop that! I can't be seen doing... that!
Kay:
OK! I'm totally taking it now! Say, "cheeeeeeeeeese!"
Edgeworth:
And thus, the long tale of the KG-8 Incident came to a close. It saw the demise of a smuggling ring and the birth of a little Great Thief. But there is little time to rest and relax... ...for I am eager to tackle the investigation into a new case. The reason for my eagerness is... ...my want to pursue the truth, and... ...my want to believe in the strength of those who use the power of the law for good. As someone who has chosen to live my life as a prosecutor... ...that is my new creed.

Agent Lang, about this piece of evidence...
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "Confidence is like a soul, and words without confidence are but empty shells." You shouldn't waste your breath on words you have no confidence in, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, it's just as bad to say something in full confidence and be wrong!
Edgeworth:
Arghn!
Kay:
Are you going to let him lecture you about your self-confidence like that!?
Edgeworth:
(I don't need to be overflowing with self-confidence; I just need to think rationally. After all, I only need to be confident in the facts!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Shi-Long Lang)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, if you could take a look at this piece of evidence... ...you'd see that there is a very big flaw in your logic.
Lang:
Flaw? Are you sure it's not your eyes that are flawed? Talk to me again when you can see straight!
Edgeworth:
(Gnnrk! Maybe this wasn't the piece I was looking for after all!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Shi-Long Lang)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That statement just now stands in contradiction to this piece of evidence!
Lang:
That thing has nothing to do with what I was saying. Now, put it away! And your logic is so badly in need of repair that you might as well throw it out, too! This is the real deal here. Your courtroom mannerisms are worthless at a crime scene!
Edgeworth:
Gnnrk...! You dare to insult the courts!?
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Franziska von Karma)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence perfectly exposes the flaw in your logic!
Franziska:
Oh? Well then, why don't you show me how it does just that? Go on!
Gumshoe:
Ooh! I bet it's this part, right? This conflicts with something, right, sir!?
Franziska:
You have no idea what you're talking about, do you!?
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe! Don't speak up when you don't know what you're talking about!
Gumshoe:
Ouch... I was just trying to follow your head, sir...
Franziska:
That you would allow a subordinate to take over... You're a disgrace!
Edgeworth:
Gnnnnnnnnrrrrk! (I guess that wasn't it...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Franziska von Karma)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. It would seem that your logic is not as perfect as you think it is.
Franziska:
And what is that supposed to mean!?
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence should show you exactly what I mean.
Franziska:
.........Oh, yes. It clearly shows what you're thinking. That you're attempting to buy yourself time!
Edgeworth:
Gnnngh! (I knew I shouldn't have tried to pull a fast one.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Franziska von Karma)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Franziska, I believe your testimony just now conflicts with this piece of evidence.
Franziska:
And I believe that when you use the phrase "I believe", you are anything but certain. Which means that showing me that piece of evidence is just a way to waste time.
Edgeworth:
Aaaaaaaaaah! (She even managed to whip the evidence at the some time!)
Gumshoe:
Owwww!! Why did you whip me, too, sir!?
Edgeworth:
(That's one more victim besides myself and the evidence...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Quercus Alba)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. That statement just now stands in clear contradiction to this evidence!
Alba:
No, it doesn't.
Edgeworth:
Ack! (But that's impossible!)
Alba:
Hmph. The prosecutors of this country... Are you all prone to pointing out nonexistent "contradictions"? How frightening it is to think that it might be true.
Edgeworth:
(Nngh... I can't let him drag me down with his insults!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Quercus Alba)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence will reveal the whole sad tale to us!
Alba:
Hmph. I have no interest in listening to such a story. The only story I'm interested in is the glorious one of my shining life. Shall I write you into one of its pages? Consider it an honor.
Edgeworth:
That's quite alright! (He didn't even bat an eye... I suppose this wasn't related after all.)
Alba:
Phwwh... I guess so! Ahahaha! Oh, I just love the way you say that with such confidence! But just as you said, you can only say something is perfect after you've verified it! Now try presenting evidence to me again, but this time, in the correct way, rookie!
Edgeworth:
.........Gnrk! (I was a fool to claim that it was perfect!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Quercus Alba)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That statement directly contradicts this piece of evidence!
Alba:
Does it now? Hmph. Not that it really matters to me either way. But are you really sure my statement contradicts that piece of evidence?
Edgeworth:
Arngh! (Judging by his overconfident attitude... ...I guess this piece of evidence wasn't related to his statement after all.)
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth... You can't chase him down with that kind of evidence!
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes, I know... (I must think calmly and rationally about this... ...because it's NOT impossible to take this man down!)
Too many penalties (during analyzing Video Tape)
Lang:
You guys... are still here...?
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang! You're back already...!?
Lang:
I told you I'd be back, didn't I? This is my case! And I'm not going to let you guys take it away from me!
Franziska:
I thought you no longer had authority over this case?
Lang:
Authority? I don't care about petty logistics! I am not about to just walk out on this case, not after how far I've come. So sorry, sis... but I need you to get out of here, too.
Franziska:
How dare you!?
Lang:
This is my turf, so get yourself on home to your den! You guys! Escort the nice prosecutors home, will you!?
MIB:
Sir! Yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
(What in the world are you thinking, Agent Lang!?)
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (during argument of Lang, when Franziska have been accused)
Lang:
Looks like I've got all the answers I need. Come on, sis... It's time for us to go.
Franziska:
Arngh!
Edgeworth:
A-Agent Lang! Please wait!
Lang:
Heh! Sorry, but I'm tired of waiting! Because I'm not one for waiting around for others to solve my case!
Edgeworth:
Ack!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! I demand that you to something about this at once!
Edgeworth:
Ack! (But I'm at a loss of what to do myself!)
Lang:
Hmph... Well, I know I have plenty to ask the sis here about. Let's go!
Franziska:
Miles!
Edgeworth:
(Arngh! Is this really where it all ends...!?)
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (after prove Franziska innocence)
Alba:
Now then, if I could ask you to please leave the premises... As you can see for yourself, I am an old man... and I'm a bit tired from all of this.
Edgeworth:
W-Wait, please!
Alba:
I've made up my mind, so if you could please leave... Agent Lang, a good job to you as well. Although, I don't think we'll ever be meeting again.
Lang:
What!?
Alba:
Now then, please respect the request of the ambassador of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...and vacate the premises.
Edgeworth:
(Gnrk! Is this it...!?)
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (during investigation of Theatrum Neutralis)
Alba:
Hmph! Are you still here? Are you still trying to force me to admit!? You people have no reason to still be here. Now, please leave.
Edgeworth:
I'm afraid I can't do that!
Alba:
Heh... If you won't leave on your own, I will have no choice but to force you out.
Kay:
Hold it!
Alba:
I don't believe we'll be meeting again, however, I will pray for your success. Heh heh heh heh heh...
Edgeworth:
We're not through here yet!
Alba:
Haaahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Edgeworth:
(Gnrk! Is this it...!?)
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Too many penalties (during argument of Alba)
Alba:
Now then, I believe I must end the game here. You've had enough fun, haven't you?
Edgeworth:
Nngh!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! If you don't do something, he's going to get away!
Alba:
I've already confessed. What else do you want from me?
Edgeworth:
...No... No... I have yet to obtain the truth behind tonight's events!
Alba:
Hmph... Do you think I really care about this "truth" you seek? Now, since I have admitted to my crime, I will need to pay the airport a visit. So if you would be so kind as to move out of my way...
Edgeworth:
Gnnrk! (Is there no way to stop this man...?)
Alba:
I don't believe we'll be meeting again, however, I will pray for your success. Heh heh heh heh heh...
Edgeworth:
We're not through here yet!
Alba:
Haaahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Edgeworth:
(Gnrk! Is it really "game over"...?)
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Nothing to Examine
Edgeworth:
There's nothing unusual about this area.
