District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Trucy:
This is it, the big day! Did you get any sleep?
Apollo:
Yeah, I went to bed at 1:00 AM or so.
Trucy:
Oh? What time did you wake up?
Apollo:
...3:00 AM.
Trucy:
That's only two hours, Apollo... But, at least you have me! ...And the Amazing Mr. Hat!
Mr. Hat:
Here's looking at you, kid.
???:
Good luck today, Apollo.
Apollo:
Th-That voice...
Phoenix:
Heya. Get any sleep?
Apollo:
...Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
I was going out of my mind with boredom, so I signed myself out earlier today. Somehow, that place makes fake piano playing at the Indochine pasta joint seem almost fun.
Trucy:
Daddy! Do you know who Prosecutor Gavin's witness is today?
Phoenix:
Take a guess!
Trucy:
Hmm... How about Little Plum?
Phoenix:
Ah ha ha! That Sherman tank of a mom? Nope, guess again.
Trucy:
That's too bad. You know, speaking of moms... You need to find me a new mommy one of these days, Daddy!
Phoenix:
It's barely morning and you're at it already, Trucy! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
(OK, see, this is why I don't buy their "father-daughter" relationship.) So, Mr. Wright! Do you know who the prosecution's witness is?
Phoenix:
...Alita Tiala. Your client's fiancée.
Apollo:
(She's going to be a witness!?)
Trucy:
But that seems odd... Why would she testify against her own fiancé?
Phoenix:
You have to wonder what Gavin's up to.
Apollo:
(Something's going down today, that much is clear!)
Trucy:
Well, not to worry. I've got my panties back. If we can't find a killer, I'll pull one out of there!
June 17, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Wocky Kitaki.
Apollo:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Klavier:
...Prosecution is warmed up, and it's a sold-out house.
Judge:
Very well, to recap... While yesterday's witness seemed more guilty than any other party...
Trucy:
Guilty of panty-snatching!
Judge:
We did find out one thing for certain. There were three people in the park at the time of the murder: The witness, the victim, and the defendant.
Klavier:
...Correct, Herr Judge. And today, I'd like to do something a little new age. I'd like to look at this horrible crime... from the outside.
Apollo:
The "outside"...?
Klavier:
The acquisition of the murder weapon... The preparation for the act... Our poor defendant told all, you see. ...To his betrothed.
Judge:
His... bee trove?
Klavier:
...His fiancée, Herr Judge. His partner for life... with no chance for parole.
Judge:
Very well, you may show the erm... "lucky" lady to the stand.
Klavier:
...Your name and occupation, Fräulein.
Alita:
Alita Tiala. My occupation... is future wife.
Judge:
Ah, traditional values! I respect that. Too many brides these days can't even weave baskets blindfolded... underwater. Yet you're here today as a witness for the prosecution?
Alita:
To be honest, I didn't want to testify at first. But... I couldn't hide the truth.
Judge:
Hmm. Honesty! Another admirable trait.
Klavier:
...Fräulein, is it true that, on the day of the crime... ...the defendant, Wocky Kitaki confessed his plans? His plans... for murder?
Alita:
...Yes.
Judge:
The witness will please give her testimony to the court!
Witness Testimony
-- Wocky's Plan --
Alita:
It was the day that the family health check-up results came back.
When Wocky found out that Dr. Meraktis had lied, he flew into a rage.
"I'll teach him!" he said. He took one of the Family's pistols...
...And, you already know what happened that night.
I... just don't see how anyone but Wocky could have done it.
Judge:
So, the pistol did belong to the Kitaki Family, then...
Klavier:
Yes. With regards to this, an investigation is underway at the Kitaki mansion... ...on charges of the possession of illegal firearms.
Judge:
And the bullet that took the victim's life? Was it...
Klavier:
...Fired from the pistol the defendant procured? Yes, this has been proven.
Trucy:
How can you prove something like that?
Apollo:
Bullets carry marks from the barrel that fired them, called "rifling marks".
Trucy:
Rifling marks...?
Klavier:
Think of them as being a gun's fingerprint, left on every bullet it fires.
Apollo:
And when did you first hear about Wocky's plan?
Alita:
It was the day of the murder. I... I should have stopped him! I just didn't think he would actually do it!
Judge:
...Very well. The defense may begin the cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Wocky's Plan --
Alita:
It was the day that the family health check-up results came back.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
That was the day of the murder, correct?
Alita:
Yes. Everyone in the Family received their check-up results that day. When Wocky looked at his, his face went so pale...
Klavier:
But of course. He had just found out he had a bullet in his chest!
Apollo:
So, you were there at the time?
Alita:
Yes... Poor Wocky...
Alita:
When Wocky found out that Dr. Meraktis had lied, he flew into a rage.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
That must have been, um, quite frightening.
Alita:
He was furious! He ripped his report up into shreds...
Klavier:
Incidentally, I had to request another copy to file as evidence. A bothersome chore, but one I performed without complaint.
Alita:
Wocky's at an age where he's hard to control when he loses his temper. Of course, that little bit of instability is so cute!
Apollo:
(Great, now he sounds like a psychopath...)
Alita:
"I'll teach him!" he said. He took one of the Family's pistols...
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
So, is it easy to take a pistol out from the house?
Alita:
Not really, I think. There's a system in place to limit access. But Wocky's a special case, being the next-in-line.
Klavier:
Perhaps his treatment was a bit too special, ja?
Alita:
Well, maybe he is a bit spoiled... I hear he got amazing presents for his birthdays. Last year was a switchblade made out of chewing gum and a chocolate gravestone!
Apollo:
(Sounds like he has a taste for sweets... and danger.)
Judge:
The point here being that Wocky had access to a pistol.
Alita:
...And, you already know what happened that night.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
"What happened"... meaning the murder.
Alita:
I tried to stop him, I really did! But Wocky wouldn't listen...
Klavier:
Our defendant was nothing if not determined, it seems.
Judge:
The last thing you should do is blame yourself, miss!
Alita:
I... just don't see how anyone but Wocky could have done it.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
How can you say that for certain? How!?
Alita:
Ah...
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Herr Forehead, you will refrain from badgering the Fräulein. It was the defendant... erm, Wocky, was it... who took the pistol from his home. We know this for a fact now.
Judge:
I suppose we do.
Klavier:
So, how could anyone else have used this pistol to shoot the victim? They could not. Simple logic, ja?
Judge:
...That does seem to be the case. Does the defense have anything to say regarding this point?
Apollo:
(Could someone else have used that pistol...?)
Had to be Wocky
Apollo:
I'm sure there was another person who could have used that pistol... ...... I just can't think of who.
Klavier:
Of course. He was the only one with access.
Apollo:
(Uh oh, this is bad if I leave it like this...!)
Judge:
You may continue with the cross-examination.
Apollo:
(Was there really no one else with access to that pistol? Someone else with Family ties...?)
Leads back to cross-examination
There was another
Apollo:
Based on your testimony, there was clearly another... One other person had access to that pistol!
Klavier:
What's this...?
Judge:
Hmm... Interesting! Let's ask the defense then... Tell the court who this other person with access was!
Present Alita Tiala profile
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Well, of course, I mean you, Ms. Tiala."
Present Plum Kitaki or Winfred Kitaki profile
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
Wh-What's this!?
Trucy:
Whaaaa--! The Boss and his wife!?
Klavier:
Ah, an unexpected ploy.
Trucy:
Apollo! That can't be right! Why would they want to frame their only son!?
Apollo:
Oh...
Judge:
On his parents' behalf, I'd like to give you a penalty.
Apollo:
(Ugh...)
Judge:
Carry on, Mr. Justice.
Leads back to cross-examination
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
......
Trucy:
...He's speechless, Apollo. The judge is speechless.
Klavier:
Ah ha ha... Herr Forehead, our judge is silent. Perhaps you will permit me to explain why?
Apollo:
N-No thanks, I think I know.
Judge:
Then you must have been expecting this penalty.
Apollo:
(Yowch... That didn't go so well...)
Leads back to cross-examination
Trucy:
Poor Ms. Tiala... I can't imagine what it would be like to be in her position!
Apollo:
(...I'm a little more concerned for her fiancé. Why would she testify against him like this...?)
Apollo:
Well, of course, I mean you, Ms. Tiala.
Alita:
...! M-Me...? But why...
Apollo:
You were quite clear when you told the court: You heard about the pistol from the defendant on the day of the murder. In other words, you knew what he was planning.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Let me get this straight... You intend to tell us that this lady stole the pistol from her fiancé... ...and killed a man in cold blood on his behalf? I've heard of people doing strange things for love, but this...
Judge:
It does seem a bit... unfathomable, to be sure. I'm all for romance, and for supporting your partner in life, to be sure. But I think I would hesitate at murder!
Apollo:
(I'd hope you'd do more than hesitate!) But what if a different connection could be proven? A connection between the witness and the victim? We might find that she had a personal motive beyond wanting to help her fiancé.
Klavier:
Hmm, that would put things in a slightly different light. What possible connection are you suggesting here?
Trucy:
You know what I'm starting to think? I'm starting to think that the police never looked inside that safe.
Apollo:
I have evidence showing a connection between the witness Ms. Tiala and the victim!
Present Alita's Sandals
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
Why, those are... flip flops?
Apollo:
"Sandals", actually. Ms. Tiala, do these look familiar to you?
Alita:
...Should they?
Apollo:
I would think so. These sandals were found in the Meraktis Clinic lobby.
Judge:
You don't mean to say those are the witness's sandals?
Alita:
He doesn't. Those sandals could belong to anyone...
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
But the fact is that they don't. They belong to you. We found toe prints on these sandals.
Alita:
...!
Apollo:
Requesting permission to match the prints with the witness's feet, Your Honor!
Judge:
Ms. Tiala, are those your sandals!?
Alita:
...... What if... What if my sandals were at the Meraktis Clinic. So what?
Apollo:
...So what!?
Alita:
You know, I've just remembered something. I hurt my hand a few days ago, and visited that clinic. I must have forgotten them then!
Judge:
Hmm... So you were there as a patient?
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Nice try, Ms. Tiala. But the defense is in possession of evidence... ...that proves a connection between you and that clinic!
Alita:
Wh-Whaat!?
Judge:
Evidence? Very well, Mr. Justice...
Apollo:
The evidence that connects her to the Meraktis Clinic is...!
Present Wocky's Chart
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"That looks like... a medical chart?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
... Well, I suppose I could see--
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Herr Forehead. This trail you think you have found, it doesn't lead to the truth. Nor to a long career in the legal profession, ja?
Apollo:
Gee, thanks.
Klavier:
Perhaps you will allow me to do the honors?
Judge:
Hmm... Why not? It might be nice for a change.
Klavier:
Most excellent... Let's rock!
Apollo:
(I'll take the usual penalty next time, thanks.)
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Justice. Try again.
Leads back to:
"The evidence that connects her to the Meraktis Clinic is...!"
Judge:
That looks like... a medical chart?
Apollo:
Found inside a safe at the Meraktis Clinic. I'd like to draw the court's attention to the names written on the chart.
Judge:
...What!? Ms. Tiala! Whatever... Why is your name on this chart!?
Alita:
...!
Apollo:
Well, care to explain the meaning of this, Ms. Tiala?
Alita:
...... I'm not sure what you mean by "meaning", Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
...! (Our warm little fiancée just froze over!)
Alita:
I was on staff at that clinic until half a year ago. It was boring. So I quit. That's all. Is there a problem with that?
Judge:
Ms. Tiala! You testified that you had no connection to the victim!
Alita:
And I don't. Now.
Apollo:
"Now"...?
Alita:
I quit half a year ago, didn't I? So there's no connection. Let me guess, you're the kind of guy... ...who can't rest until he knows every last detail of his girlfriend's past. Am I right?
Judge:
Th-That's not true at all! Why, I... I embrace the ones I love, past flaws and all, no matte--
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
"There's no connection now" doesn't fly in a court of law.
Alita:
Doesn't... fly?
Apollo:
(She's one tough nut. She probably feels right at home with the Kitakis!) You left your job at the Meraktis Clinic, true... But these sandals prove that you remained connected!
Alita:
Ah...! W-Well, who knows? I'm sure there are lots of people with those sandals...
Klavier:
So sorry, Fräulein, but your act isn't working.
Alita:
...!
Klavier:
Your moment of hesitation just now cost you.
Alita:
Wh-What's with you? I thought you were on my side!
Klavier:
I'm afraid there is no side but that which the evidence supports, Ms. Tiala.
Leads to:
"..."

"There's no connection now" doesn't fly in a court of law.
Alita:
Doesn't... fly?
Apollo:
(She's one tough nut. She probably feels right at home with the Kitakis!) You left your job at the Meraktis Clinic, true... But you remained connected somehow!
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Justice. Show us evidence that proves the witness is still connected to the Meraktis Clinic!
Present Alita's Sandals
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"These sandals were found in the Meraktis Clinic lobby."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
... Well, I suppose I could see--

"Show us evidence that proves the witness is still connected to the Meraktis Clinic!"
Apollo:
These sandals were found in the Meraktis Clinic lobby. ...They're yours, aren't they?
Alita:
Ah...! W-Well, who knows? I'm sure there are lots of people with those sandals...
Klavier:
So sorry, Fräulein, but your act isn't working.
Alita:
...!
Klavier:
Your moment of hesitation just now cost you.
Alita:
Wh-What's with you? I thought you were on my side!
Klavier:
...Perhaps you are unaware that toes leave "toe prints"? A simple analysis of these sandals will reveal all.
Leads to:
"..."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
... I fail to see exactly what sort of connection this shows.
Apollo:
Well, see, that's because... (...there isn't one?)
Judge:
...I believe I understand. And I believe your wildly wandering eyes deserve a penalty.
Apollo:
(...One more try! I'll get it this time!)
Leads back to:
"I have evidence showing a connection between the witness Ms. Tiala and the victim!"
Alita:
... Well, now we see your true colors. I was wrong to cooperate with you from the beginning! I just wanted... I just wanted you to help get Wocky back on the straight and narrow.
Judge:
Hmm... This court thinks you need to worry less about Wocky and more about yourself. It sounds as though we need to hear a bit more about your story.
Apollo:
Your sandals were found in the entrance to the clinic... Which means you went there on the day of the murder!
Alita:
Well, there's little point in denying it.
Judge:
Very well. The witness will tell us about this visit. Why did you go to the Meraktis Clinic that day?
Witness Testimony
-- The Meraktis Clinic --
Alita:
I did go to the clinic that day. My first time in half a year, since I quit in January.
I went to warn him. After all, I knew Wocky had the pistol.
The doctor always was a timid man... too timid to admit his own mistake.
Why else would I have gone? I'm not hiding any dark secrets.
I wanted to tell him to be careful, as an old friend.
Judge:
By "mistake", you mean... ...the mistake we heard about from the defendant? The botched operation?
Alita:
He was a timid, small man... but I never wished him harm. I just thought I should let him know, you know?
Judge:
Hmm... That does make sense.
Klavier:
Yes, but there is still one thing which does not.
Judge:
What's that, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
The sandals left in the lobby, of course. We can assume she wore these sandals to the clinic, ja? Then why did she not wear them home? If it were me, I would have worn them home.
Judge:
I would have worn those sandals home, too.
Klavier:
So, why were the sandals left behind?
Alita:
...!
Apollo:
(Ack! He pointed out the contradiction before me!)
Klavier:
...There's probably a good explanation for this. Right, Ms. Tiala? ...Say, for instance... There happened to be a similar pair of sandals there which you wore home by mistake?
Alita:
... Actually, that's right. I'm impressed, Mr. Gavin.
Klavier:
Oh, it is nothing. There is, after all, no other possible explanation. Ja, Forehead?
Apollo:
(Oh, what the...! No fair! He's filling the holes in her testimony...)
Judge:
The defense may begin the cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- The Meraktis Clinic --
Alita:
I did go to the clinic that day. My first time in half a year, since I quit in January.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Around what time did you go to the clinic?
Alita:
I don't remember exactly, but it was after 9:30, I think.
Apollo:
And that was the first time you had contacted Dr. Meraktis in half a year?
Alita:
Of course it was. He wasn't the kind of boss you made "friends" with.
Judge:
So, why did you go to the clinic that day?
Alita:
I went to warn him. After all, I knew Wocky had the pistol.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Did you want Dr. Meraktis to run away?
Alita:
Well, after I failed to stop Wocky... ...I thought that was the only other way to avoid the problem.
Apollo:
Couldn't you have called? Why go in person?
Alita:
I called several times that evening, but no one was in.
Klavier:
The victim was busy driving home until after 9:00 PM that night, remember? This was proven by this mirror yesterday, ja?
Alita:
I thought if I warned him, he would run away for sure. Knowing the doctor...
Alita:
The doctor always was a timid man... too timid to admit his own mistake.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You mean that act of malpractice on Wocky, correct?
Alita:
If he had just told Wocky the truth in the beginning, none of this would have happened.
Judge:
True, that operation was the start of this whole affair.
Alita:
Oh. Of course, if he'd told him... ...he might have been "erased" by the Kitakis much earlier.
Judge:
A disturbing thought!
Klavier:
We know that the Meraktis Clinic had ties to the Kitaki Family. He probably couldn't have gone to the police, even if he wanted to.
Alita:
That's why I knew I had to warn him!
Alita:
Why else would I have gone? I'm not hiding any dark secrets.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
No "dark secrets", eh?
Alita:
What? Look at me however you want, Mr. Justice, you won't find a thing.
Apollo:
(She's hiding something, I know it! I must have some evidence that proves it, too...)
Alita:
You're free to think whatever you like. I went to that clinic with only one thought in mind.
Present Wocky's Chart
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
This chart was found inside a safe in the doctor's office.
Alita:
...Yes?
Apollo:
Why would this one chart be in that safe? Ms. Tiala, you know why it was, don't you?
Alita:
...!
Judge:
Mind filling me in?
Apollo:
Dr. Meraktis didn't have the leisure of making "mistakes". That's why he wrote up a false report, and kept the truth locked away.
Klavier:
...Bad Herr Doktor.
Apollo:
And this is where you come in, Ms. Tiala.
Alita:
...
Apollo:
The nurse who filed this chart was you, which means... ...you knew about Wocky's failed operation!
Judge:
Interesting...
Apollo:
You were in the same position as Dr. Meraktis! Kind of makes it hard to claim "no connection", doesn't it?
Alita:
You're bold for a novice, I'll give you that.
Apollo:
...!
Alita:
Mr. Justice, you must know I was only a nurse. The doctor is responsible for the chart's contents.
Judge:
Hmm... This chart business seems to be quite important. Please amend your testimony accordingly.
Alita:
Too bad, little attorney.
BRACELET THUMPS
Apollo:
...!
BRACELET THUMPS
Apollo:
(My bracelet's reacting again!)
Trucy:
What is it, Apollo?
Apollo:
I felt my bracelet vibrate just now...
Trucy:
Your bracelet...?
Apollo:
Just like yesterday. Like you said!
When a witness is unsure of something, their nervous habit gives them away!
Trucy:
But... I can't see anything, Apollo.
Apollo:
Eh...? (Then what's my bracelet reacting to?)
Trucy:
Wait, maybe... Yes, that has to be it!
Apollo:
What has to be it?
Trucy:
Your senses, Apollo... They must be sharper than mine!
Apollo:
Huh...?
Trucy:
I can't see it, but you can sense it!
Apollo:
I don't know about that, Trucy! I don't have some kind of special power or anything.
Trucy:
Listen to me, Apollo! There's a weak point somewhere in Ms. Tiala's testimony! But we don't know what her nervous habit is.
Apollo:
Well, then what do we do!?
Trucy:
You have to perceive it yourself, Apollo! With your eyes... and your senses!
Apollo:
(Then it's up to me and my bracelet... I don't know why, but the bracelet helps. Somehow, touching it helps me focus. Let's give it a shot and bring down that testimony!)
Changes statement from "Why else would I have gone? I'm not hiding any dark secrets." to "Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?"
Alita:
Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
But your signature was on that chart.
Alita:
So? What does that have to do with this case? If there was something in that chart to make me look bad, I would have dealt with it. The only one responsible for that chart is the presiding doctor... Dr. Meraktis.
Apollo:
(She's hiding something, I can smell it... And I bet she's got a habit that gives it away! I just have to focus to find her nervous habit! Maybe it's time to give my bracelet a rub...)
Perceive ring twitch on "go to the clinic now"
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Apollo:
Why go to the clinic for a half-year-old chart now, you ask? But, you know why you would go "now", don't you.
Alita:
I don't know what you're talking about.
Apollo:
It was quite clear, Ms. Tiala. You have a nervous habit. The moment you said the word "now"... ...you used your right thumb to fiddled [sic] with your ring.
Alita:
Wh-What?
Apollo:
(She was unsure... I saw it! "Now"... That's the key word!) The chart wasn't a part of your past... It was a clear and present threat!
Alita:
That's ridiculous, why if that were the case... ...I would have had six months to do something about it!
Apollo:
Indeed.
Alita:
Eh...?
Apollo:
Which means something happened quite recently... Something to make that chart a problem for you now.
Alita:
...!
Apollo:
(I've got her on the ropes now, I can feel it! Time to strike the killing blow... with evidence!) ...Ms. Tiala. There's no use trying to hide it. The chart became a threat to you now... because of this!
Present Wocky's Check-Up Report
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"A health check-up report.. belonging to the defendant."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Alita:
...Because of what?
Apollo:
Um...
Alita:
The eyes of a hawk... and the brain of a toad.
Apollo:
(Ribbit! I mean, ack! I can't lose this now! C'mon toad brain, one more try!)
Leads back to:
"The chart wasn't a part of your past..."
Apollo:
A health check-up report.. belonging to the defendant. The Kitakis are trying to get out of the business. The health check-up this month was their first ever... ...What did you think when you heard about this?
Alita:
Eh? Oh, n-nothing. Why should I think anything?
Apollo:
Oh? I would think you were positively beside yourself. Because you were afraid. You knew what Wocky's chest X-ray would reveal!
Alita:
...Urk!
Apollo:
A full half year had passed since the operation. You thought you were home free... ...when the chart came back to haunt you!
Alita:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Apollo:
That's all, Your Honor.
Judge:
...... Wh-What just happened? Did... the witness just admit to lying?
Alita:
...!
Klavier:
I sensed it. There was a great "aura" emanating from Herr Forehead. ...Very cool. So, the lady was lying, it seems.
Apollo:
That's correct. She said she had no connection to the Meraktis Clinic. But her connection was deep indeed... A bit too deep. If the Kitakis got a hold of this chart with her name... ...she'd be finished. Isn't that right, Ms. Tiala?
Alita:
... You guessed it.
Judge:
Order! Order!!!
Apollo:
(I-I did it! I broke her testimony!)
Trucy:
Amazing, Apollo! I didn't see it at all! Daddy was right about you!
Alita:
Wait!
Apollo:
...!
Judge:
Ms. Tiala?
Alita:
It's true, that chart was bad news for me. That's why I went to meet the doctor that day! But that's all! I told him about Wocky and went home!
Klavier:
...It appears this cross-examination is far from over.
Apollo:
Wh-Whaaaat!?
Klavier:
She hid the truth from us, this is clear, yet... It is not clear that this truth has anything to do with the case at hand!
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. The witness will add this to her testimony. And... we'll have a bit more cross-examination.
Apollo:
(Grr! I was so close!)
Trucy:
You're still close! Keep on her, Apollo!
Changes statement from "I wanted to tell him to be careful, as an old friend." to "Nothing happened at all. I warned him, and left."
Press (after perceiving correctly)
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
We already know you're lying about having no reason!
Alita:
I know you know! Don't look at me like that!
Apollo:
Huh...?
Alita:
Like I'm some two-bit washed up good-for-nothing... You scared me!
Klavier:
...I concur. Even I am rarely treated to such a... hot gaze.
Apollo:
S-Sorry... (Maybe I need to do some face training, too...)
Alita:
I wanted to tell him to be careful, as an old friend.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
But, then you'd be betraying Wocky, wouldn't you?
Alita:
No, I did it for him, for us!
Klavier:
She went to warn him, so that her fiancé would not have to commit such a crime, ja?
Alita:
I didn't want them to take my Wocky away...
Alita:
Nothing happened at all. I warned him, and left.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
How did Dr. Meraktis respond to the warning?
Alita:
Oh, he was quite surprised. Panicky, even. Who wouldn't be scared to learn a Kitaki was after them?
Judge:
Incidentally, this court is not afraid of any mobsters! Why, we had a life-threatening situation just yesterday right here in this courtroom.
Apollo:
(Yeah, real impressive the way you stood up to the attack of the Amazing Mr. Hat, sir...)
Klavier:
...After which I carried you back to your chambers.
Trucy:
...Sounds like the judge had quite a fright.
Apollo:
("Nothing happened" in Dr. Meraktis's office that day, huh...)
Trucy:
But what about the mess we found? Something definitely happened in that office, Apollo!
Apollo:
I know, I know... But we can't prove "when" it happened. Nor that Alita Tiala was in any way involved...
Trucy:
Well, let's try putting some evidence up anyway!
Present Bullet
Apollo:
Objection!
Leads to:
"You say "nothing happened" in the doctor's office."
Apollo:
(There's no way she went to that clinic just to "warn" him!)
Trucy:
Do you know why she went, Apollo?
Apollo:
(Time to figure out what really happened at that clinic... and fast!)
Apollo:
You say "nothing happened" in the doctor's office. I disagree. Take a look at this.
Alita:
What's that? It looks like a squished-up ball of clay. Kind of like you, actually.
Apollo:
This bullet was found in the Meraktis Clinic office. Something did "happen" in that office, Ms. Tiala!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Enough of this joking around. The police investigated that clinic.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Ah, but this was stuck inside the doctor's safe.
Klavier:
Inside the safe...?
Trucy:
I guess the police didn't check that far.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...But there is a problem. How can you say that bullet was fired on that day?
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Weren't you the one who explained rifling marks to us?
Klavier:
...!
Apollo:
The pistol was taken from the Kitaki Mansion that day. If the marks on this bullet match the murder weapon... ...then that proves a firearm was discharged in that office on the day of the murder!
Klavier:
... Not bad, Herr Forehead.
Judge:
Bailiff! Have this bullet analyzed immediately!
Thirty minutes later... A report arrives: "The rifling marks on both bullets are identical."
Judge:
Well... It seems as though the bullet in the safe was fired from the murder weapon.
Klavier:
...
Judge:
Perhaps the defense would like to state their position?
Apollo:
...The bullet in that safe proves one fact: A pistol was fired in that office on that day. And at the time of the firing, the safe was open. The safe which contained the top-secret chart.
Judge:
Do you think someone was threatening Dr. Meraktis? In order to open the safe?
Apollo:
Only one person was in a position to do such a thing. Our witness, Alita Tiala!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! Mr. Justice! Where are you going with this? Are you accusing the witness!?
Apollo:
Alita Tiala knew about Wocky Kitaki's botched operation! She got engaged to him without telling him about it! As long as that bullet remained in his chest, his days were numbered. What if she married him, and then the bullet finally reached its destination!
Judge:
Wh-Whaaaat!?
Klavier:
That reminds me. Apparently, the Kitakis have been asserting themselves in lawful business practices... They're making quite a great deal of money... a fortune, if you will.
Judge:
Nefarious! So she planned to marry him just to get her hands on this fortune?
Objection!
Wocky:
You keep talking trash about my Alita... ...and I'll sue you, lawyer-man!
Apollo:
...Huh? Me!?
Wocky:
Yeah! You said... You said you'd... You'd... You'd abuse my Alita!
Apollo:
Um, I think you mean "accuse"...!
Wocky:
Same difference! Well you can't have her! She's mine! It was me! I shot that doctor! Me! He left me to die, so I left him to die, too, there in that park!
Apollo:
W... Wocky! Just cool down a second, please!
Wocky:
You keep your hands off my Alita! Or I'll...
???:
...Tee...
Alita:
Tee... hee hee ha ha ha ha!
Judge:
M... Ms. Tiala?
Alita:
I-I'm sorry. I just... It's been so long since I've laughed so hard.
Apollo:
Something funny?
Alita:
...Wocky. Wake up and smell reality!
Wocky:
A... Alita-baby?
Alita:
The signature on the chart, the engagement... I mean, come on! It's so obvious. Even for a brainless, spoiled brat such as yourself.
Wocky:
Alita...
Klavier:
Your honesty is like a breath of foul air, Fräulein.
Alita:
Hey, I wasn't getting out of this clean, anyway.
Apollo:
So... The Family fortune is what you're really after!
Alita:
That's right. I wanted the money.
Wocky:
No way! That's wack! I ain't trying to hear that!
Alita:
Should have done the wedding earlier. Oh well. ...By the way, can I ask you a question?
Apollo:
Who, me?
Alita:
I believe you said you were going to abuse me?
Apollo:
...Accuse.
Alita:
Of what crime, might I ask?
Apollo:
Huh?
Alita:
Oh, I'm a bad girl. Sure. I got close to that brat because I wanted his money. But he was the one with the pistol. He could've fired it into the safe after I'd already left the clinic.
Apollo:
What...?
Alita:
I would never do a thing like that. It was definitely that silly brat.
Apollo:
Wait, but...
Trucy:
What are you talking about!?
Apollo:
T-Trucy...?
Trucy:
You had the most to lose if that chart was found!
Alita:
...But I didn't have a pistol, now did I?
Trucy:
W-Well, you could have taken Wocky's!
Alita:
You'd think he'd have mentioned that, no? All I've heard him say is, "It was me! I shot him!"
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
That's only because he's trying to protect you!
Klavier:
Sorry to intrude in this lovely conversation...
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
But the two of you are forgetting one critical point.
Trucy:
What... What point!?
Klavier:
Certainly, the Fräulein wanted that chart. You assume she threatened the doctor into opening that safe. But then... ...wouldn't she have taken the chart?
Trucy:
Oh...
Klavier:
You see? That chart wouldn't have been left in that safe!
Trucy:
Ack!
Apollo:
(He... He's right!)
Judge:
...Ms. Tiala.
Alita:
...Yes?
Judge:
It is clear to this court that you are not a very good fiancée.
Alita:
Oh, I'm flattered.
Judge:
Perhaps it's time you told us the truth? Tell us about yourself, including your actions and whereabouts on that day.
Apollo:
Don't forget! We've proven that you were at the Meraktis Clinic on the day of the crime!
Alita:
......
Witness Testimony
-- The Meraktis Clinic 2 --
Alita:
Yes, I went to the clinic that day to speak to the doctor.
I wanted that chart, but I failed to get it. So I went back to the clinic later.
In any case, I didn't shoot him. You don't even have proof I stole that pistol, do you.
And that brat was spotted in the park at the moment of the crime!
Frankly, I don't think it matters if Dr. Meraktis was shot in the temple or not.
Judge:
You went back "later"...?
Alita:
That chart was dangerous, you understand. I needed to get rid of it, that's why I went that day...
Klavier:
But you couldn't get the chart then, could you?
Alita:
...And later that night, Dr. Meraktis was shot. I heard about the shooting, waited a day, but then I had to go back... ...No easy feat with the cops all over the place.
Apollo:
...Ah! Th-That was you!?
*thump*
Trucy:
......! Ah... Apollo! That sound... It came from behind this door!
Apollo:
(...Someone's in there!)
Apollo:
A break-in! They left through that window!
Apollo:
So you were the burglar...
Alita:
That was you two? If only I had one more minute... ...then I could have opened that safe and gotten the chart!
Judge:
What!? That's trespassing! And brazen, at that!
Alita:
Oh, is this a trial for trespassing now? Besides... You can't blame a girl for wanting to protect herself... They are gangsters, you know.
Judge:
In any case, Mr. Justice, your cross-examination!
Apollo:
(Admitting the little crime to avoid the big one, eh?)
Cross Examination
-- The Meraktis Clinic 2 --
Alita:
Yes, I went to the clinic that day to speak to the doctor.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Why "that day"?
Alita:
That brat was uncontrollable. He was ready to kill! And that would bring in the police... And that chart would become evidence... And I'd be hung out to dry... *sniffle*
Trucy:
But the police didn't check the safe, did they?
Apollo:
Well, they thought the crime scene was the park.
Klavier:
I'll make sure the responsible parties feel the heat... Such sloppiness won't be tolerated, ja?
Apollo:
(I'm kinda thankful for that sloppiness myself, actually...)
Alita:
I wanted that chart, but I failed to get it. So I went back to the clinic later.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
"Later"...?
Alita:
When I heard what happened, well, I was too scared to do anything that day. So I waited until the day after... The 16th, was it? ...Of course, you and that meddling kid had to get in my way.
Judge:
But why did Dr. Meraktis keep that chart around? It was clearly dangerous for him. He could have burned it.
Alita:
Because he's a coward. The chart was his insurance.
Judge:
Insurance...?
Alita:
My signature on that chart, to be more specific. That made sure I couldn't betray him.
Alita:
In any case, I didn't shoot him. You don't even have proof I stole that pistol, do you.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
But you could have stolen it!
Alita:
"Could have"? Is this some new definition of proof?
Apollo:
We'll ask Wocky. He'll tell us!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Might I remind you this is a cross-examination? You might want to keep your baseless theories to yourself.
Apollo:
Mmmmmnk! (He's right, isn't he...)
Alita:
And that brat was spotted in the park at the moment of the crime!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Y-Yeah, but... Um...
Alita:
But what? You have nothing to say. This case is over. It was over the moment that brat was seen in the park! What's the point in dragging it out any further?
Alita:
Frankly, I don't think it matters if Dr. Meraktis was shot in the temple or not.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Leads to:
"The doctor was shot in the right temple, yes?"
Apollo:
(I think we're seeing her true colors now...)
Trucy:
She's trying to push all the blame on Wocky! And she's getting away with it!
Apollo:
(My bracelet didn't react to anything this time... I guess that means there's nothing worth perceiving... Time to get old school!)
Apollo:
The doctor was shot in the right temple, yes?
Alita:
So it seems.
Klavier:
...Let's review the facts again, shall we? If the killer shot from this location... ...the bullet would've struck our victim square in the forehead. However! The entry wound... ...was in the right temple.
Judge:
Yes, we heard testimony on this yesterday. At the time of the shooting, the witness was standing here. Just before the gun was fired, he shouted. The victim turned his head to look... and was shot.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
But that testimony was proven to be a lie! Our egregious panty-snatcher, Mr. Stickler, did witness the crime... But he was standing to the north, next to the trash can where he tossed those panties! If Mr. Stickler shouted from this location, the bullet couldn't hit his right temple!
Alita:
Silly, silly attorney...
Apollo:
Wh-What...!?
Alita:
Do you remember what you had for breakfast that morning?
Apollo:
... Do you remember, Trucy?
Trucy:
I always have a glass of milk for breakfast.
Alita:
What matters is one thing: The doctor was shot in his right temple. If that's the case, there can only be one explanation! The panties guy was mistaken.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
But his location was proven! You can't write that off as him being "mistaken"!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...Then why don't you show us, Herr Forehead?
Apollo:
Show you... what?
Klavier:
Must I explain everything? Very well, let's recap: If the witness, panties guy, was standing to the north... ...then where was the shooter standing? From what location did the killer shoot the victim?
Judge:
But wait! If the witness was standing there... ...how could anyone shoot the victim in the right temple?
Klavier:
...Ah ha ha ha ha! I merely laid out the facts for us. It is up to the one possessing the shiny forehead to show us. ...If you can, that is.
Apollo:
(Wocky Kitaki was standing at the "Killer" mark... Wesley Stickler at the "Witness" mark... And of course Pal Meraktis was at the "Victim" mark...)
Judge:
Let's hear what the defense has to say. Where was the killer standing when they shot the victim?
At the "killer" mark
Apollo:
At the "killer" mark, of course!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
In one fell swoop, we are back where we were yesterday, ja? How do you explain the wound in the victim's right temple?
Apollo:
............ Uh, that is a problem, isn't it?
Judge:
Thank you, Mr. Justice, for pointing out the obvious!
Trucy:
That would make Wocky the killer, Apollo! Geez!
Judge:
One more time, if you would.
Leads back to:
"Let's hear what the defense has to say."
At the "witness" mark
Apollo:
The killer was standing at the "Witness" mark!
Judge:
That would explain the wound in the victim's right temple.
Klavier:
So, once again, you are accusing Wesley Stickler? ...As the murderer of Pal Meraktis?
Apollo:
(I would be, wouldn't I...)
Alita:
Finally, a glimmer of sense.
Klavier:
Very well, Herr Forehead. Show us proof! Have you evidence that incriminates Wesley Stickler?
Apollo:
(I guess he really is the most likely suspect... Do I have some evidence that shows Mr. Stickler did it?)
Present anything
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"........."
Klavier:
.........
Judge:
Apparently, you lack this promised evidence.
Apollo:
(Ugh... That wasn't it...)
Klavier:
You'll never succeed if your base assumption is faulty. Perhaps you should rethink this from the top, ja?
Apollo:
(Maybe he's right...)
Klavier:
In fact, you may want to rethink your choice of career.
Apollo:
(Hey, that was a bit uncalled for, don't you think!?) Your Honor, the defense would like to reconsider!
Judge:
...Very well. This penalty should help keep you on track.
Leads back to:
"Let's hear what the defense has to say."
Someplace else
Leads to:
"As the facts stand now, we can't explain this crime..."
Apollo:
As the facts stand now, we can't explain this crime... ...without contradicting ourselves at some point. But I know why. The real killer shot from an entirely different location!
Alita:
What are you talking about!? I don't see any other place...
Judge:
Apparently, Mr. Justice does. ...Let's hear it. Where in the park did the killer shoot the victim from?
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
It's time to raise the roof! ...And the stakes.
Apollo:
Eh?
Klavier:
Penalties are such frightening things, don't you think? But what if they were a bit more... terrifying? ...Like so.
Judge:
D-Double penalty?
Klavier:
Herr Forehead wishes to take us in a new direction? Then he must be ready for the challenges ahead!
Apollo:
...Challenge accepted. (It's Justice time!)
Trucy:
A-Are you sure, Apollo?
Apollo:
(The key is the witness, Mr. Stickler's testimony! If we believe that, and we know where he stood... ...and the victim turned when he shouted... ...there's only one place the killer could have been!) The killer shot the victim from... here!
Present noodle stand
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I believe we all owe a debt of gratitude..."
Present Killer or Witness mark
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
This is where the killer shot from!
Judge:
But then the killer couldn't have shot his right temple.
Klavier:
So young, and already senile. How unfortunate...
Judge:
I'll have you know I'm not senile! Why I remember exactly what I ate the morning of the crime! .............................. Ahem! Penalty!
Apollo:
(...No fair.)
Klavier:
You seem intent on digging your own grave. Here, have a shovel and try again.
Leads back to:
"The key is the witness, Mr. Stickler's testimony!"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
This is where the killer shot from!
Judge:
Hmm. I hadn't thought of that.
Apollo:
None of us did, Your Honor!
Klavier:
And this explains the wound in the right temple how?
Apollo:
... I hadn't thought of that.
Judge:
An amusing diversion, Mr. Justice. Penalty.
Klavier:
Yes, amusing... like your career, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
(Fine, rub it in...)
Klavier:
Perhaps you would be so kind as to try again?
Leads back to:
"The key is the witness, Mr. Stickler's testimony!)"
Apollo:
I believe we all owe a debt of gratitude... ...to Ms. Alita Tiala.
Alita:
Wh-What do you mean?
Apollo:
Thanks to you, we had a chance to review the crime... ...and this time, we were prepared. We know that Wesley Stickler was telling the truth! We should have listened to him from the beginning. Wesley Stickler was standing next to the trash can when he saw the two men. ...He shouted, just as he told us in his testimony. ...And the victim turned to look in his direction. A shot was fired! The victim was hit in the right temple.
Judge:
Oh no...
Apollo:
Oh yes! Which direction was his right temple facing at that moment? That's right! Toward the noodle stand!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! S-So you're saying... ...the killer was inside the noodle stand!?
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...Let's think about this a bit more, shall we? You say the killer was "inside the noodle stand". Which would mean the victim, Dr. Meraktis came to the park... ...wheeling his own murderer in the cart behind him!
Alita:
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! I'd think you'd notice if you were pulling someone along!
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
There's something we should worry about before that! Why was he pulling the noodle stand in the first place!?
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Let's deal with our problems one at a time, shall we? Someone was hiding in the stand... We have not come this far to talk about "possibilities". ...Let's talk about "proof", baby. Show us evidence that proves someone was in that stand!
Apollo:
(Can I prove that...?) You want evidence that someone was in that stand...?
Well, I've got it!
Apollo:
...I've got it right here.
Judge:
Intriguing! Let's see what you've got.
Leads to:
"Show us proof that someone was hiding in the noodle stand!"
Well, too bad!
Apollo:
Well, too bad!
Klavier:
.........
Apollo:
...Kidding! Just kidding! I've got it! (...Whew, close one.)
Judge:
...Then let's see it.
Leads to:
"Show us proof that someone was hiding in the noodle stand!"
Judge:
Show us proof that someone was hiding in the noodle stand!
Present Slippers
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
""The Meraktis Clinic"... And they're covered with paint."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
... Thoughts, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
We have a choice between Heaven... or Hell. Either our brains are damaged, or Herr Forehead's is. I wonder which it is?
Judge:
...This court finds Mr. Justice's brain faulty. ...By majority vote.
Apollo:
(Ugh... Time to pick something else...)
Judge:
How about showing us the right evidence this time?
Leads back to:
"Show us proof that someone was hiding in the noodle stand!"
Apollo:
"The Meraktis Clinic"... And they're covered with paint. These slippers were found in a trash can near the crime scene.
Klavier:
And...?
Apollo:
A single slipper print was found at the scene... ...Right next to the noodle stand!
Alita:
Ack...!
Apollo:
Oh, and Ms. Tiala. Your toe print was found in the left slipper!
Alita:
Urk...!
Apollo:
In other words... ...this is proof you were inside that noodle stand!
Alita:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Yet there was only one slipper mark found at the scene... ...Can this be called a footprint, in good faith?
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
...Observe the diagram! A park pathway runs right next to the slipper mark! A slipper wouldn't leave a trace on a cobblestone path!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...Yet you still cannot say this is a "footprint", ja?
Apollo:
Why not!?
Klavier:
You have an impression left by a single slipper... What if it was on the stand and simply fell to the ground?
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
That's... That's just dumb!
Klavier:
One more thing. A noodle stand is typically cluttered with the tools of the noodle-making trade. There's no room for a person to ride in there!
Judge:
Hmm... You have a point. Could someone have hidden in that stand?
Trucy:
Apollo! I think I might be on to something!
Apollo:
...?
Trucy:
I think I've figured out one of our pieces of evidence! In order to make room in the stand, some things would have to be...
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? Do you have proof that someone could have hidden in the stand?
Apollo:
I can prove one thing. Someone did scheme to clear space in that stand!
Present Bowl
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is a noodle bowl from the stolen Eldoon's Noodles noodle stand."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
... I don't see how that evidence relates to the matter at hand.
Apollo:
(Ack! ...That wasn't it. Maybe if I submit another piece of evidence while he's thinking...)
Judge:
Stop right there! I think someone's "scheming" to avoid a penalty. ...We'll have none of that.
Apollo:
(Oops...)
Klavier:
Again, Mr. Justice, if you would. Your evidence?
Leads back to:
"I can prove one thing."
Apollo:
This is a noodle bowl from the stolen Eldoon's Noodles noodle stand.
Judge:
Yes, and what about it?
Apollo:
We discovered a large quantity of these bowls yesterday... ...in the lobby of the Meraktis Clinic!
Alita:
...!
Judge:
A large quantity of noodle bowls in the victim's clinic?
Apollo:
Mr. Eldoon was very clear about those bowls.
Guy:
Well, I don't care who did it! Without that stand, I'm finished! All my noodle bowls were in there, too.
Apollo:
Yet the bowls were removed! That night, there was space inside that noodle stand! Space created at the Meraktis Clinic, no less. Right around the time that you were there, Ms. Alita Tiala!
Alita:
Stooooooooooooop! I won't listen to any more of these wild fantasies! No... not fantasies... They're worse lies than that spoiled brat's pickup lines!
Judge:
I would like to remind the witness of her current status. This court does not consider you entirely innocent.
Alita:
Show me an innocent... I'll show you a fairy tale.
Judge:
...In any case. The defense has, somehow, made its point. The witness had both a motive and an opportunity to kill Dr. Meraktis.
Alita:
More fairy tales! This whole trial is a fairy tale!
Judge:
Then please, pull us back down to reality, Ms. Tiala. I'm giving you one last chance to explain yourself.
Apollo:
(This is it! Why was Dr. Meraktis pulling that stand that night...? ...And what was Alita Tiala doing inside it? Time to get to the bottom of this case!)
Witness Testimony
-- Tiala's Explanation --
Alita:
That night, I went to ask Dr. Meraktis for the chart.
I had no intention of ever letting that chart fall into the Kitaki Family's hands.
But Dr. Meraktis didn't understand...
For some reason, he thought the Kitakis had sent me!
So I gave up and went home... All I did was talk to him!
Apollo:
You knew about the botched operation... So you tried to get rid of the chart, to save yourself!
Alita:
I won't make excuses. ...And I did warn the good doctor. I gave him a chance. I told him that brat got his health check-up report. ...And that he was coming to settle the score.
Judge:
Hmm... I see. Very well. Mr. Justice, begin your cross-examination.
Apollo:
...Yes, Your Honor. (This is the last testimony! Either I perceive the truth, or it's over!)
Cross Examination

Judge:
The victim was a man in good health... I don't see how she could have coerced him.
Klavier:
True. It would have been impossible without a pistol.
Apollo:
(But what if she did have a pistol...?)
Alita:
I'll admit I wanted the chart. That much is true. ...My reason was simple.
Alita:
I had no intention of ever letting that chart fall into the Kitaki Family's hands.

Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
It certainly would have put a damper on your wedding plans, I'd say.
Alita:
Not only that. If the Kitakis had gotten that chart... ...I'd probably be with Dr. Meraktis now, pulling that great noodle stand in the sky.
Klavier:
It seems our witness was in a fix as well.
Alita:
Who would want to die pulling a noodle stand?
Trucy:
When I die, it will be by disappearing mysteriously in the middle of a magic act!
Apollo:
Could we be a little less morbid!? Please!?
Alita:
So you see, I needed that chart.
Alita:
But Dr. Meraktis didn't understand...
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
He didn't understand...?
Alita:
He wouldn't listen to a word I was saying! The moment he saw me, he started to tremble... Hah, I thought, what a sad excuse for a man!
Apollo:
(Please don't smile like that anymore... It's creepy.)
Alita:
He was practically delusional!
Alita:
For some reason, he thought the Kitakis had sent me!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
They "sent you"?
Alita:
He thought the Kitakis had sent me to get the chart.
Klavier:
It makes some sense. You are their son's fiancée.
Alita:
Don't make me laugh! The Kitakis? Send me? They don't play that way. If they'd known about that chart, they would have gone in there with guns blazing. But I couldn't convince the trembling doctor otherwise.
Alita:
So I gave up and went home... All I did was talk to him!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
If that was really all that happened... ...what were all those noodle bowls doing there?
Alita:
How should I know? There weren't any bowls when I went, I know that much! Why don't you let me be and go look for your killer someplace else, alright?
Apollo:
(Do I detect uncertainty there...?)
Perceive neck scratch on "All I did was talk to him!"
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Leads to:
""All I did was talk"... and lie."
Apollo:
(...This is my last chance!)
Trucy:
Apollo... any word from your bracelet?
Apollo:
Yeah, actually... (I felt it respond...!)
Trucy:
I couldn't see a thing! It's up to you, Apollo!
Apollo:
(Time to perceive the truth! ...Here comes Justice!)
Apollo:
"All I did was talk"... and lie.
Alita:
Wh-What? Show me proof!
Apollo:
(I'm pretty sure about this one... I think I'm getting the hang of this. A little slip in confidence, and they give it all away.) The proof... is you, Ms. Tiala.
Alita:
...!
Apollo:
"All I did was talk to him", you claim... Yet you can't hide your own nervous twitch when you say those words!
Alita:
My "twitch"? What are you talking about!?
Apollo:
You have a habit of scratching the area of your neck around the edge of your scarf.
Alita:
Wha--! Wh-Wh-What!?
Apollo:
(This is working better than I'd hoped! Her unconscious actions tell the truth she won't say. Habits and lies... Two dots... Connect the dots and find the truth!)
Alita:
D-Don't look at me like that! I t-told you the tr-truth...
Apollo:
It seems that when you recall what really happened in that office... ...you can't keep your hands off your neck, can you?
Alita:
...!
Apollo:
(Hmm... It seems that nervous habits... ...are unconscious reactions that manifest when someone is trying to hide something!) You can't hide behind your scarf, Ms. Tiala! Something happened between you and the victim in the Meraktis Clinic office!
Alita:
...
Apollo:
And I've got proof that shows exactly what happened!
Present Lamp
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Wh-What's that...?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Alita:
...I knew you were bluffing.
Apollo:
Huh...?
Alita:
I could tell by the way you fondled your spiky hair!
Apollo:
(Ack! She found my habit! I'd better rethink this... OK, when we found the Meraktis Clinic office... ...there were signs of a struggle, and a bullet in the safe. Ms. Tiala was willing to do anything to get that chart. So something happened... But what?)
Leads back to:
"You can't hide behind your scarf, Ms. Tiala!"
Alita:
Wh-What's that...?
Apollo:
...You're touching your scarf again.
Alita:
...!
Apollo:
...There's something unusual about this lamp. The bulb is broken... and there's a red splotch on the cord.
Alita:
Eh...
Apollo:
Seeing how you hide your neck... I think I can come up with a plausible explanation for the lamp's state.
Alita:
Well spit it out! This talking in circles nonsense is killing me!
Apollo:
Very well. The answer is very simple. Ms. Alita Tiala... Please remove your scarf!
Alita:
! ........................ Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
This is a trial to determine what happened in that park. Yet we seem to have drifted off target.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
We'll find out soon enough if we're drifting... As soon as the witness removes her scarf.
Alita:
I... I won't do it! This is insane! I'm a... an unrelated third party! You can't order me to remove my clothing!
Judge:
...Ms. Tiala. I'm afraid you've forgotten what's already been proven.
Alita:
What...?
Judge:
You're hardly "unrelated". ...Please remove your scarf.
Alita:
No. Nooooooooooooooo!
Apollo:
...I knew it. So I was right, wasn't I, Ms. Alita Tiala!
Judge:
Your neck... That isn't what I think it is!?
Apollo:
Something did happen that night at the Meraktis Clinic! You needed to get that chart back, no matter what it took. Even if you had to steal your fiancé's pistol to do it!
Judge:
B-But wait! Looking at this lamp, and the witness's neck... It looks like the very opposite happened!
Apollo:
Exactly. The victim in the clinic that night... ...was this witness! Specifically... ...you tried to threaten Dr. Meraktis and he attacked you! That's what happened that night at the Meraktis Clinic!
Alita:
Urk......!!! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek......................................................
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! Will someone please tell me what really happened!?
Alita:
I told you the truth already! I went to the clinic that night to warn Dr. Meraktis!
Alita:
...That gangster knows everything! He's coming for you!
Meraktis:
...Looks like my clinic's seen its last patient.
Alita:
We have to get rid of that chart! Quick, open your safe! Give it to me!
Meraktis:
...So you can save your own skin?
Alita:
What...?
Meraktis:
I know what you're up to. You want in with the Family... And if they see that chart, you're finished.
Alita:
......
Meraktis:
...Leaving me holding the short straw. But if I'm going down... I'll want some company. You!
Apollo:
And what happened next!?
Alita:
He jumped at me, and knocked me to the floor! Then, he took that cord... ...Pal Meraktis was serious. Deadly serious. He really tried to strangle me. I... I must have blacked out.
Judge:
So... you were the victim!
Klavier:
And the red splotch on the cord... was your lipstick.
Alita:
I... I didn't want to remember that night. That's why I didn't bring it up. There... Are you happy now?
Apollo:
Eh...
Alita:
I was out cold, almost killed! And you claim I then snuck into that noodle stand... But how could I!?
Apollo:
Aaaaaaack!
Judge:
Well, one thing is clear. We now know what really happened at the Meraktis Clinic. And it would seem that our victim was not entirely without blame himself!
Alita:
I... I'm sorry. I get so nervous just thinking of it, it's hard to breathe. I've told you everything. Can I go home now?
Judge:
Hmm... You bear some responsibility for events that day, true. Yet, if you were also a victim... ...this court would owe you some sympathy. ...Well, Mr. Justice? I believe this clears up the remaining questions for Ms. Tiala.
Apollo:
(When did this happen!? Suddenly, everyone's sympathizing with her!)
Trucy:
I don't know what to think anymore, Apollo... I mean, is that it? Do we know everything we need to know about Ms. Tiala?
Judge:
Very well! This finishes the cross-examination of this...
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Heh. Heh heh heh. Not so fast. This party's just getting started! Now, we rock!
Apollo:
W-What!?
Klavier:
Those spikes on your head are softer than they look... Or do you not have the stomach to go all the way?
Judge:
Prosecutor Gavin...?
Klavier:
Pal Meraktis choked Alita Tiala... ...She fell unconscious. But what happened next?
Trucy:
He's right! There is more we don't know!
Apollo:
But... she was choked hard enough to leave that mark! She would have been out for a while!
Trucy:
Even still, what if it was her in that noodle stand!
Apollo:
...! (Alita Tiala, half-dead... Dr. Meraktis pulling that stand... And a bullet fired from inside the noodle stand...)
Trucy:
What if it's all true!? We might have already figured out what truly happened that night!
Apollo:
Ms. Alita Tiala, as you can see... ...we're not through with you just yet.
Alita:
...You really want to blame me for this murder, don't you? You, too, "Prosecutor" Gavin.
Klavier:
Me? Fräulein, I only wish to know the truth.
Apollo:
Well, let's go back over what we've learned up till now. On the day of the murder, Wocky saw his check-up report. ...From which he learned about the bullet still inside him. So, he took a pistol from the Family stash... ...with the intent to give Dr. Meraktis some of "his own medicine".
Trucy:
And Ms. Tiala heard about this from Wocky. So she went to the Meraktis Clinic ahead of him! ...In order to get rid of the chart with her signature!
Apollo:
But then... something happened.
Alita:
...Sounds like you've figured it all out. But remember, I was the victim! I was out cold.
Apollo:
But, what about Dr. Meraktis?
Klavier:
That does seem to be the problem... He had just strangled Alita Tiala, perhaps, he thought, to death. What did he do after his crime?
Alita:
I was just knocked out! Not dead!
Klavier:
From the state of his clinic, and the scene in the park... ...I think it's clear what the good doctor did next. Well, Herr Forehead? Care to guess?
Apollo:
...!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? What did Dr. Meraktis do!?
Apollo:
(Maybe he did think he killed Alita Tiala... Do I have evidence to show what he did next...?)
Present Noodle Stand
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...As his next move, Dr. Meraktis..."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
This evidence shows what he did next!
Judge:
...
Klavier:
...Shows what, Herr Forehead?
Judge:
Your smile has a sort of sick desperation to it, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
(What, this smile?)
Judge:
...Let's try again, shall we?
Leads back to:
"Well, Mr. Justice? What did Dr. Meraktis do!?"
Apollo:
...As his next move, Dr. Meraktis... ...stole Guy Eldoon's noodle stand!
Alita:
What, "killing" me disturbed him that much? So much he randomly stole a noodle stand!?
Apollo:
It wasn't so "random". Remember all the bowls in the clinic's foyer? Bowls that belonged inside that stand? I think it's pretty obvious, don't you? That stand was at the clinic. However, the question is why did he remove the bowls?
Trucy:
Maybe... because the stand was heavy?
Apollo:
Or he wanted to put something in the stand in their place...
Judge:
Ah... Wait, you don't mean...!
Apollo:
I do. Dr. Meraktis did replace those bowls with something... ...your "corpse", Ms. Tiala!
Alita:
M-My "corpse"!?
Apollo:
Dr. Meraktis panicked. He thought he'd killed you...
Klavier:
...His next move would be to dispose of the body!
Alita:
Th-That's crazy talk! You're all crazy!
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Then let's think about it... logically. The doctor had a place to dispose of you in mind... ...But on the way there... ...who should he run into but the defendant, Wocky Kitaki!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...I question your "logic".
Judge:
What's this, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
The park is a dead end. Why would he head in that direction to begin with?
Alita:
That's right! He had no reason to go there! ...Oh, now I get it! It was a trick! That spoiled brat made him do it! He made the doctor steal the stand!
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Tell me... Why would someone go to a "dead end"? ...Unless the park was his destination!
Alita:
Wh-What...?
Judge:
Apparently, the defense has an idea. Tell us where Dr. Meraktis was heading with the stand! Here, please show us on this diagram. To where exactly was the victim dragging that stand?
Present river
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"There? That's a... a river!"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
The victim was heading here!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Ah yes, of course. There. ...Why?
Apollo:
............ I'm young, Your Honor. I'm still making up my mind about a lot of things.
Judge:
...Perhaps you should leave the court until you grow up.
Apollo:
(...Ugh.)
Leads back to:
"Here, please show us on this diagram."
Judge:
There? That's a... a river!
Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor. I scarcely need to explain why.
Klavier:
...A perfect place to dispose of a body.
Alita:
H-He was going to throw me into that river!?
Klavier:
He didn't have many other options, Fräulein.
Alita:
...
Apollo:
I believe this clears up all of the remaining questions. The victim pulling the stand, and the defendant before him. ...And inside the stand, you, Ms. Alita Tiala.
Alita:
Urk...
Apollo:
And then, the denouement. Wesley Stickler, of panty-snatching fame, walks up. Seeing the two men, he shouts! In that instant...
Alita:
So... I shot him?
Apollo:
You were the only one who could have stolen Wocky's pistol. It had to be you!
Judge:
...Well, Ms. Tiala?
Alita:
...... Hmph. ...Nice work.
Apollo:
...You mean, I'm right?
Alita:
I mean you've done a fine job dreaming up a story... ...to get that spoiled brat off the hook!
Trucy:
You're the one who's dreaming! Apollo's backed up everything he's said with facts! If you're so sure he's making it up, give us another reason! Why was Dr. Meraktis pulling that stand through the park!?
Alita:
Who knows? But there's one gaping hole in your logic. I think Mr. Gavin knows whereof I speak!
Apollo:
Whereof what!? (I can't believe she's still trying to deny this!)
Judge:
Is this true, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
...Must I always be the one to point out Herr Forehead's errors?
Apollo:
...! (Ack, maybe there really is something!)
Klavier:
I believe the Fräulein speaks of... Herr Doktor's car.
Apollo:
His car...?
Alita:
That's right! The Meraktis Clinic has that big garage!
Judge:
In which sat... a green sports car, was it?
Alita:
Why would he steal the stand in the first place!? If he wanted to carry a body, he would have used his car!
Apollo:
Ack...!
Klavier:
And so we find our victim without probable cause to steal that stand... ...and our defense without a case.
Objection!
Trucy:
Um... I have an idea! You know that green car? I bet it wouldn't run! It was broken!
Klavier:
Ah, what an excellent counter-argument, Fräulein. Too bad you're quite wrong.
Trucy:
Eh...
Klavier:
Don't tell me you've forgotten what happened to your daddy?
Trucy:
Daddy...?
Apollo:
Th-That's right...! That night, the car that hit Mr. Wright... ...was that green sports car!
Judge:
Oh, yes! I-I'd nearly forgotten about it!
Klavier:
Afterward, he drove it back to that garage. It ran fine.
Alita:
...That's right. So why didn't he use his beloved sports car, hmm?
Apollo:
Urk...!
Klavier:
A glaring contradiction, to be sure. More glaring than your forehead.
Apollo:
No... Nooooooooooo!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Well, Mr. Justice? Why didn't Dr. Meraktis use his car to carry the "body"?
Apollo:
Uh... Umm...
Klavier:
Is that a groan of surrender I hear?
Apollo:
......
Klavier:
Some advice: Now's a good time to review all you know. ...Everything you've learned over the last two days.
Apollo:
(Everything I've learned...?)
Judge:
Mr. Justice, this contradiction casts doubt on your entire case! This is truly your last chance! The defense will explain to us what happened that night!
Someone else stole the stand.
Apollo:
Actually... It was someone else who stole that stand!
Judge:
B-But then why was the victim pulling it!?
Apollo:
Well... Um... He would have had to steal it from someone else!
Judge:
... We're back where we started, Mr. Justice.
Klavier:
Without an explanation for why he didn't use the car.
Judge:
I'll ask you again!
Leads back to:
"This is truly your last chance!"
The car didn't run.
Leads to:
"I have an idea... It's all coming together!)"
He carried the body in the car.
Apollo:
The victim... used the car to carry the body!
Klavier:
Ah, so you're throwing out everything you've proven up until now?
Apollo:
Well, if the car wasn't broken...
Klavier:
I admire your adaptability in the face of impossible odds. Yet this does not explain why he was pulling that stand.
Apollo:
(What's going on...? Is Prosecutor Gavin trying to tell me something...?)
Judge:
Perhaps we need to ask you again.
Leads back to:
"This is truly your last chance!"
Apollo:
(I have an idea... It's all coming together!) ...That night, Dr. Meraktis couldn't use his car.
Alita:
Hah! Now you're making even less sense than usual!
Apollo:
...Not according to my information, Ms. Tiala. Put one and one together, and the explanation is simple!
Judge:
If it's so simple, perhaps you can show us some evidence? Show us proof why the car wouldn't run that night!
Present Trucy's Panties
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Let's see now... Panties!? Again!?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
This is proof of why the car broke down that night!? Well, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
Ah, it's proof of a malfunction, alright. ...A malfunction in Herr Forehead's brain.
Judge:
The court accepts this evidence!
Apollo:
(Hah, hah, very funny, guys.)
Judge:
Mr. Justice! You will mend your malfunction and present evidence that makes sense!
Leads back to:
"Show us proof why the car wouldn't run that night!"
Judge:
Let's see now... Panties!? Again!?
Trucy:
All sorts of things come out of my panties! ...Even the truth.
Alita:
...?
Apollo:
Another crime was committed the night of the murder. The theft of these panties! The latest in a string of similar thefts, actually. But that night, the snatcher was caught in the act! A brave young girl chased the thief until they hid... ...in the Meraktis Clinic garage.
Alita:
Wh-Whaaat!?
Apollo:
The snatcher hid the panties there before running... ...Perhaps someone in this court remembers where he hid them?
Judge:
Why... weren't they found in the car's exhaust pipe?
Apollo:
...Exactly. By the way, I learned something yesterday... ...A very important piece of information. ...And I learned it from you, Prosecutor Gavin!
Trucy:
Um, so you were here investigating?
Klavier:
And I was on my way home... when my hog gave up the ghost.
Apollo:
Your hog...?
Klavier:
My motorcycle won't start. A clogged exhaust pipe...
Trucy:
Too bad! It looks like such a nice bike, too. Hard to believe that it could break just from that!
Klavier:
Cars, motorbikes, they're all the same. Clog the exhaust, and they won't run.
Alita:
My, how interesting.
Apollo:
While Ms. Tiala and the doctor were struggling... ...the panty-snatcher snuck into the Meraktis garage. From that time, until the time we found these... ...that car wouldn't start.
Alita:
Wh...What...!?
Trucy:
That's why Dr. Meraktis had to use the noodle stand! It was the next closest thing he could think of!
Apollo:
...Well, Ms. Tiala? This wraps your doubts up quite nicely, I think!
Alita:
... So it does.
Alita:
(Where... Where am I...? So dark... Can't see... ...Cramped...! The pain... my throat's burning...!)
Meraktis:
Wh-What's your problem!?
Wocky:
You, Doc! I know what you did!
Meraktis:
Ah...!
Alita:
(...Wocky?)
Wocky:
...You lied to me! So you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna give you a taste of your own medicine, man!
Meraktis:
W-Wait! Let me explain!
Wocky:
F-Fine. I'll give you your last request.
Meraktis:
Listen, you're being tricked! But not how you think! It's not just me...
Alita:
(No...! He'll ruin everything! ...I have to stop him!)
Stickler:
C-Cease this at once, y-y-you two!
Alita:
Funny. This isn't the way it was supposed to turn out. Oh well. Too bad.
Judge:
There's still one mystery... How did you manage to disappear from that stand?
Alita:
In the silence after the shot, I heard the witness running...
Klavier:
I believe we heard as much from Wesley Stickler. He went to use a public phone to inform the police.
Alita:
...Which is when I made my escape.
Apollo:
...Which is when you left that slipper print!
Alita:
Dr. Meraktis didn't bother taking my slippers off. I threw them out after I stepped in that paint, though.
Apollo:
...That was your mistake.
Alita:
No. My biggest mistake... ...was coming to you for help, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
Eh...
Alita:
I believed in you! You and your "Anything Agency"... If anyone would get Wocky declared guilty it was you!
Apollo:
...
Judge:
I believe we've reached a conclusion of sorts. ...Prosecutor Gavin. How is Ms. Alita Tiala doing?
Klavier:
She's confessed to everything. We're processing her arrest now.
Trucy:
Prosecutor Gavin sure seems calm for someone who just lost...
Apollo:
(I think he already knew... He'd figured out she was the killer a while ago...)
Klavier:
Some advice: Now's a good time to review all you know. ...Everything you've learned over the last two days.
Apollo:
(He lost... but I didn't exactly win, either.)
Klavier:
...Hmm? Something the matter, Herr Forehead?
Judge:
Looks like it's time to announce a verdict...
Not Guilty
Judge:
Court is adjourned!
June 17, 4:12 PM
District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Trucy:
Great job, Apollo! You did it!
Apollo:
Yeah, we did, somehow...
Trucy:
Wocky's off the hook... ...free to become the gangster he's always wanted to be! And he has you to thank...
Wocky:
Hey! Attorney-man! You're gonna pay for what you did to my Alita, homes!
Trucy:
...Or to blame, I guess.
Wocky:
You give my Alita back! Stupid pointy-head attorney with a death-wish!
???:
Enough, Wocky!
Apollo:
Ah! Mr. Kitaki...
Big Wins:
...It's high time you opened your eyes, Wocky.
Wocky:
What do you know, old man! I think it's 'bout time you opened yours! Givin' up the life, tryin' to become some kinda businessman!
Big Wins:
Don't talk about what you don't understand, Wocky!
Trucy:
...I'm afraid the guard is going to throw them both out.
Apollo:
...If not in jail. Wouldn't that be a happy ending.
Trucy:
Hey, maybe we can help them out! We know why Mr. Kitaki needs to make so much money... Maybe we should tell Wocky. Oh, Wocky? Apollo has something to tell you!
Apollo:
Huh? I do? (Way to put me on the spot...)
Wocky:
Eh? Whazzat?
Trucy:
Show him the reason why, Apollo!
Apollo:
(Why is Mr. Kitaki trying to become a business man...?)
Present Wocky's Check-Up Report or Wocky's Chart
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
Think about it, Wocky... Think about your condition.
Wocky:
...!
Apollo:
I talked with your mother, Little Plum, yesterday.
Plum:
It pays... but we need a lot of money right now. Clean money, that is.
Wocky:
...She doesn't mean... You aren't really... are you?
Leads to:
"...I searched the globe. And I found one."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Wocky:
...Eh? You're bugging.
Apollo:
(I think that means I messed up...)
Big Wins:
Wocky, I don't care what you think of me... But you should know how your mother feels.
Trucy:
...Little Plum?
Apollo:
(What was that she said...?)
Plum:
It pays... but we need a lot of money right now. Clean money, that is.
Apollo:
(Wait, could she mean...?)
Wocky:
Wh-What's this about, old man?
Leads to:
"...I searched the globe. And I found one."
Big Wins:
...I searched the globe. And I found one. A doctor who can take that bullet out of you, Wocky. But it's an expensive procedure.
Wocky:
M-Man! B-But you got plenty of money already, don't you?
Big Wins:
I won't use it.
Wocky:
...!
Big Wins:
It was the gangster life that did this to you, Wocky. ...I want to help you, and I want to do it clean. Please understand. Wocky...
Wocky:
D-Dad... M-Man, I see how it is, old man! Always you looking out for... out for...
Trucy:
Wocky...?
Wocky:
Listen good, old man! One day... One day... I'm gonna take you out! Then we'll see who's the O.G.! You try to hide in your business suit, I'll find you! Stupid ol' geezer!
Trucy:
My! Wocky!
Big Wins:
...No, it's as it should be.
Apollo:
Mr. Kitaki! (I liked him more without the puppy dog eyes.)
Big Wins:
I'm glad... to have met you. I'm not so good with words... But I know a professional job when I see one. Thank you.
Apollo:
Who? Me? I don't think...
Big Wins:
Someday... I'll bake you one of our latest... The Kitaki Lime Pie.
Apollo:
(...He's opening a pie shop!?)
Big Wins:
...So long.
Apollo:
(And he was gone...)
Trucy:
Well, let's head back, Apollo! To the Wright Anything Agency!
Apollo:
Hey, since when do I work at your agency!?
Trucy:
Aw, we make a good team! Don't just stand there, let's get going!
Apollo:
(Huh... Why not. She did help me out. And there's a few questions that still need answers... Like this power of mine that she showed me... And my bracelet... If anyone can help me figure it out, it's her. Though I can't say I care much for what her father has become...)
Trucy:
Oh, that's right! We have to go someplace first!
Apollo:
Huh? Where?
Trucy:
Why, to claim our reward from Mr. Eldoon!
Apollo:
...Ah, salty noodles. Right. He got his stand back already?
Trucy:
Oh, and after that, you can come see my show! With a special appearance by the Amazing Mr. Hat!
Mr. Hat:
Oh, it's special alright!
Apollo:
Please... anything but him.
THE END
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Apollo:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
...You don't sound very sure, Mr. Justice. Objection overruled.
Apollo:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Apollo:
They aren't, are they...?
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Justice, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Apollo:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts the evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Apollo:
...Um... You sure about that?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
(Ack! That didn't go so well.)
Perceive wrong area (during cross-examination segment "The Meraktis Clinic")
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Apollo:
Ms. Tiala! You're unsure about something, aren't you?
Alita:
...Not as unsure as you are.
Trucy:
Wow, she sure showed you.
Apollo:
Grrr...! (I've got to focus and find her habit. Find that... ...and I'll find the weak spot in her testimony!)
Perceive wrong area (during cross-examination segment "Tiala's Explanation")
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Apollo:
...Gotcha, Ms. Tiala!!!
Alita:
I heard you just fine the first time. What, I wasn't aware we were playing paintball.
Apollo:
......
Trucy:
She's one cool cucumber, that Alita.
Apollo:
(...Hmm. Maybe I spotted the wrong spot. But my bracelet reacted! There must be something in this testimony! I'll find your weak spot, Alita Tiala...)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Wocky Kitaki...
Guilty
Judge:
The defendant will surrender himself to the court's care... ...to undergo a regular trial at the High Court within a month's time. Court is adjourned!
