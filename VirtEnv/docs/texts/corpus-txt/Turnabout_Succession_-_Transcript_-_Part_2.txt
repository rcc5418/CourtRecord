District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 6
Apollo:
Good morning!
Examine evidence
Landscape
Sketch
Trucy:
This rough sketch is only half-hidden by the oil painting.
Apollo:
I'll never understand artists.
Trucy:
Still, it's impressive. I wouldn't you could hide such a dark sketch under a little paint.
Apollo:
Well, it is called "oil paint" for a reason. I bet it's pretty oily. The paint I mean.
Trucy:
I'm still waiting for you to get to your point.
Vera:
......
Trucy:
So! You're... Vera, right? I'm Trucy! Trucy Wright! That's "Wright" with a "W"! Uh, but not "write", right?
Vera:
......
Trucy:
Um! We're... on your side! You can tell us anything! ...Please?
Vera:
...... ...Good morning...
Apollo:
...! (She... She speaks!)
Trucy:
Hmm, not bad, not bad. But I think you'd do better with a little smile, you know? You're so pretty! You need to sell yourself, you know?
Apollo:
Trucy! Let's... take it easy for starters.
Vera:
...... ...Thank you for taking my case...
Trucy:
...!
Apollo:
(Okaaaaay... Well, that's a start, I guess.)
Vera:
......
Apollo:
(There she goes with the nail polish again...)
Trucy:
That's great, really! It's so cultured!
Vera:
............ ...Want to try...?
Trucy:
Oooooh! Really!?
Apollo:
*sigh* Girls... (The victim, Drew Misham, was a forger. And a stolen painting was found in his studio. A life of crime, really... ...And maybe one that led to his death.)
October 8, 10:00 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
Well, we will now... er... *cough* Begin the, er, trial of... Vuh... Vuh... Vuh... Vera Misham!
Trucy:
...Is the judge OK? His voice is all raspy, and he's looking around all nervous-like.
Judge:
Erm... ahem. The repercussions of today's trial will, most likely, be felt for a long time. ...And may, indeed, alter our legal system forever.
Klavier:
Today is a test of the Jurist System... ...and the first step toward a new order in our courts.
Trucy:
Daddy's secret mission!
Klavier:
The jurists will function like a jury. It is hoped their inclusion will help the courts to better reflect the people's will.
Apollo:
Why... aren't there any jurists in the courtroom?
Klavier:
Three closed-circuit cameras watch this courtroom at all times. The jurists have access to everything that transpires. Jurists! Judge well, and judge cool.
Judge:
N-Now see here, Prosecutor Gavin! I-I was going to say that!
Klavier:
Ah, my apologies, Herr Judge.
Judge:
Ahem. Jurists! Today, er... Judge today's trial "coolly", if you would be so kind!
Apollo:
(The jurists are unbound by the letter of the law. They don't affect the trial with evidence... but by their "feelings". And we're about to find out just what effect they're going to have.)
Judge:
Very well, Prosecutor Gavin. The details of the case, if you would.
Klavier:
The victim is the painter Drew Misham. He was killed in his own studio. His coffee... was poisoned. By whom, you ask? By none other than the defendant, Vera Misham.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
There wasn't any poison in the coffee!
Klavier:
Achtung... Someone has been doing their homework! Indeed. Poison was not present in the coffee... but on the mug itself.
Judge:
The mug...? Ah, residue was found on the rim, I see.
Klavier:
The autopsy report describes the manner of our victim's death.
Judge:
The court accepts this as evidence.
Misham's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Judge:
According to this report... ...the victim's death was caused by "atroquinine" poisoning.
Klavier:
A chemical compound that does not occur naturally. Lethal dosage is a mere 0.002mg. A touch of atroquinine in the body... ...is the touch of the Reaper's scythe.
Judge:
Very well, Prosecutor Gavin. You may present your witness.
Klavier:
I have for you today a simple man, for a simple case. ...A man who witnessed the murder in its entirety.
Apollo:
(That journalist, no doubt...)
Klavier:
The witness will state his name and occupation.
Brushel:
Ah! Right! Well, for starters, my name's Spark Brushel! My job is... a lone observer of the world!
Apollo:
In other words, a freelance journalist, right?
Brushel:
Ahem! If you don't mind, I'd like to state something here for the record.
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Brushel?
Brushel:
I dislike conclusions, specifically, the jumping to aspect of conclusions. "Preconceptions Make Park Sandbox of Endless Desert Waste..." end quote.
Apollo:
But, you are a journalist. You said so yourself yesterday.
Brushel:
...Well, that's true, yes. But you must understand, I stand before you today a man with a dream! I'm offering you my testimony in exchange for exclusive rights to the story! "Scoop Turns Mr. Brushel Into THAT Mr. Brushel!" end quote.
Judge:
...Let's hear your testimony then, shall we?
Apollo:
(A "simple case", eh, Gavin? For me, the jury... is still out.)
Witness Testimony
-- The Journalist's Story --
Brushel:
I visited the studio around 9:00 that night to do the interview.The first outsider to enter the atelier! "Journalistic History Made", end quote!His daughter brought us coffee right after we started.And you know what happened next. "Star Falls!" end quote.No one else entered the room besides her the whole time.
Judge:
Hmm... That does sound like a simple case. Unless... you were the one who poisoned him!
Brushel:
Wh-Wh-Wh-Whatareyousaying!? Judge!
Judge:
Ahem. Need I remind you, the cameras are rolling today. I felt the need to be a bit dramatic.
Klavier:
You didn't do it, did you?
Brushel:
M-M-M-M-Medoathinglikethat!? Come on! That's like... "Newsmaker Making the News", end quote. Or even "Contemporary Witch-Hunt", end quote! I know! "Wild Accusations Rock Courtroom", end quote.
Klavier:
Ah ha ha ha. Rock, indeed.
Trucy:
Prosecutor Gavin sure looks like he's having fun.
Apollo:
I'm so happy for him.
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Justice, your cross-examination, please.
Cross Examination
-- The Journalist's Story --
Brushel:
I visited the studio around 9:00 that night to do the interview.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
9:00 at night? Isn't that a little late for an interview?
Brushel:
If the great painter Drew Misham says, "come at 9:00"... ...believe you me, I go at 9:00! The first, and as it turned out, last interview with such a prolific painter!
Apollo:
Right. Can you tell us what it was like when you arrived?
Brushel:
The first outsider to enter the atelier! "Journalistic History Made", end quote!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You were the first reporter ever in "Drew Studio"?
Brushel:
Posterity will look back on that night as a turning point in journalistic history! "A Basically Insignificant Step For All Mankind... But A Giant Step For That Brushel Guy", end quote.
Klavier:
If no one on the outside ever had access to the studio... ...then it would serve to reason that the deed was done by an "insider".
Apollo:
(...By which he means Vera did it.)
Klavier:
So, how did this epoch-making interview go?
Brushel:
His daughter brought us coffee right after we started.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
...Would you mind being a little more specific?
Brushel:
Oooh wee, let me tell you, I enjoy a cuppa. In fact, it all began when I was in third grade, no wait, fourth grade--
Apollo:
That's not what I meant!
Klavier:
I believe I know what Herr Forehead is driving at. This coffee the victim was served... Did anyone other than the victim touch it?
Apollo:
R-Right! That! (That's what I was going to say, really.)
Brushel:
Well, now, if you've got a question to ask, you'd best straight up ask it! That's what I tell all the new recruits. Several times, if necessary. "Write for a grade schooler", that's my motto. Which isn't to say I can only write grade school-level stuff, mind you--
Apollo:
...Who touched the coffee!?
Brushel:
Dunno. I was in the back, looking at the studio's equipment when she served it.
Apollo:
......
Klavier:
...And what happened next?
Brushel:
And you know what happened next. "Star Falls!" end quote.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
What's this about a star falling?
Trucy:
"Star Falls!" huh... It's like an old telegram! "Send Money, Over".
Brushel:
Zowie! You don't know? That's like a journalism code word. An important personage passes away... a star falls. Get it?
Trucy:
But there's no gravity in space, is there? I wouldn't think stars could fall, really.
Apollo:
...Does this matter?
Brushel:
Hoo boy! This is good stuff, good stuff! How about "Star Breaks"... Nah... lacks punch. I know, I know! "Star Dies". Nah... lacks imagination. Of course, you could go with "Drew Dies". Straight, to the point. I like it.
Apollo:
(I think we need to hear about something a little more substantial...)
The moment of death
Apollo:
Um, about when Mr. Misham passed away...
Brushel:
Hoo boy, what a scene that was! He puts his coffee mug down with a crash, right?
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, and then?
Brushel:
Then the cold finger of Death touches his spine! Life's flame sputters and fails! So cold was that touch, he could do naught but tremble uncontrollably! ...Actually "life's flame" is a little tired. "Life's river froze over"... Yes! That's a go.
Trucy:
...I think he's starting his article already.
Apollo:
Could you describe that a little more simply?
Brushel:
Well, as you can imagine, I was pretty surprised. He hit the floor, as they say. "Artist's Seizure Is Final Performance", end quote.
Klavier:
Atroquinine paralyzes the central nervous system. The body arches back like a bow, the limbs tremble, the throat burns--
Judge:
Th-That's quite enough of that! Some of us want to be able to sleep tonight.
Brushel:
Oh yeah? Well I want details, lots of juicy details!
Klavier:
For that you can listen to our last year's hit single. "Atroquinine, My Love", by the Gavinners. Available at all major music outlets.
Judge:
The point here is that the victim died of atroquinine poisoning. Well, Mr. Justice? How did you find that testimony?
Very important
Apollo:
Well, as an account of the moment of the victim's death, I'd say it's very important. ...Please add it to the testimony.
Judge:
Very well. The court requests the witness add this account to his testimony.
Adds statement "Those spasms... That was definitely death by poison."
Not important
Apollo:
(You'd think the moment of Mr. Misham's death would be important... ...But Mr. Brushel's story really didn't tell us anything we didn't already know.)
Judge:
Very well, please continue with the testimony.
Leads back to cross-examination
Brushel's coffee
Apollo:
So, you drank the coffee that Vera served you, too?
Brushel:
Course. "When someone serves you coffee, you drink it"... That's what my old boss always used to say. Never did get what he meant by it, though.
Apollo:
But you're still alive, which is to say, you didn't die.
Brushel:
Of course not! "No Point Falling Before You're A Star", end quote.
Apollo:
...That's not exactly what I was getting at.
Klavier:
What were you getting at, then? You know the poison was on the rim, not in the coffee.
Brushel:
Oh yes, yes! There were two cups on the tray she brought. And one of the cups had Drew's signature painted on the side.
Apollo:
(Hmm. No chance the guest would take that one by mistake, I guess.)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? Was that testimony important?
Very important
Apollo:
We're talking about the coffee the witness drank. I'd say that is important!
Judge:
Very well, please add that to your testimony, Mr. Brushel.
Adds statement "I drank the coffee, too, but I'm not dead yet!"
Not important
Apollo:
(So Brushel drank the coffee, too... Doesn't look like this is going to lead to much...)
Judge:
Very well, please continue with the testimony.
Leads back to cross-examination
The "star's" coffee
Apollo:
You say Mr. Misham had the coffee, too. But did you actually see him "drink" the coffee?
Brushel:
Course! "He Who Sees It Wins, But He Who Says It Wins Bigger", end quote. I live in a man-sees-dog-eat-dog-and-writes-about-it world. Yet...
Apollo:
"Yet"?
Brushel:
I guess I can't say I "saw" him drink it, really. He had one so-called "sip", if that. "Man Puts Lips To Mug, Drinks?" end quote.
Judge:
Hmm. That poison is quite virulent, I hear.
Brushel:
My stomach did a so-called "somersault". Since I'd gulped down that coffee without so much as a second glance at it. Wait, maybe something's there! Some kind of so-called "trick"! Anyone want to venture a guess? For the record?
Apollo:
(Does this guy have a pause button?)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? Did you find that testimony valuable?
Very important
Apollo:
The victim drank his coffee, then immediately fell over?
Brushel:
Oh yes, yes. You can go to press with that one.
Apollo:
Your Honor! This is a vital piece of information! Please add it to the testimony.
Judge:
Very well. The witness will add this to his testimony.
Brushel:
Vital! Right!
Adds statement "He had one sip, if that. The next moment, he was on the floor!"
Not important
Apollo:
(The coffee Mr. Misham drank... That has to be important somehow... ...Nah.)
Judge:
Very well, please continue with the testimony.
Leads back to cross-examination
Brushel:
Those spasms... That was definitely death by poison.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You say it was "definitely death by poison"... How can you be so sure?
Brushel:
Hey, look, I'm a journalist. I've seen a lot of things. And I've had more than my share of experiences with so-called "poisonings". "Man Eats Fishy Fish, Goes Bye-Bye"... end quote.
Apollo:
(Food poisoning doesn't count. Hmm. Should I get him to talk about something else?)
No need
Apollo:
(Let's just go with what we have for now.)

Apollo:

Apollo:
You're sure you drank the coffee?
Brushel:
Oh yes, yes, quite. I gulped it down, felt that sweet scorch in my throat!
Apollo:
But you say the victim took one sip and fell over. ...And you still kept drinking?
Brushel:
Course! "Drink your coffee when it's hot, never when it's not". That's what my old boss used to always say. Never really knew what he meant by it.

Present Coffee Mug
Apollo:
Objection!
Leads to:
"You know what I have a problem with? A particular property of the poison used, atroquinine."
Brushel:
No one else entered the room besides her the whole time.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Can you say that for sure?
Brushel:
For sure? Sure! I'm sure. Drew Studio isn't a big place, kiddo. I'd know it if someone else had come in!
Apollo:
What if they had been hiding in there from before!?
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Even if someone had been hiding in the studio... ...they hardly could have poisoned that mug without anyone noticing.
Brushel:
You think I, Spark Brushel, would miss something as obvious as that? Nooooo way.
Trucy:
He sure makes it sound exciting. I guess that's his job.
Apollo:
There's only one moment we need to focus on, really.
Trucy:
...The moment when Drew Misham died?
Apollo:
Exactly. There has to be something there!
Apollo:
You know what I have a problem with? A particular property of the poison used, atroquinine.
Judge:
Oh? Prosecutor Gavin was quite clear about the poison. A lethal dosage of 0.002mg paralyzes the central nervous system. If you drank that, even you, Mr. Justice, would be reduced to a quivering pile...
Apollo:
(Why are you using me as an example!?) Unfortunately, we weren't told everything. There was a vital omission in Prosecutor Gavin's information!
Klavier:
......
Judge:
An omission?
Apollo:
Atroquinine is as virulent as he says. But death doesn't come upon ingestion, not immediately. That's because atroquinine is slow-acting!
Judge:
Slow-acting!
Brushel:
Whatwhatwhatwhat!?
Apollo:
According to one forensic scientist...
Ema:
It's one of the most virulent poisons, but is absorbed into the body astonishingly slowly. It takes at least 15 minutes from the time of ingestion for adverse effects to show.
Apollo:
If we suppose that the moment Mr. Misham sipped the coffee was when he sealed his fate... ...then he would still have had time left to enjoy his last cup of joe!
Judge:
Order! Order!!! What's the meaning of this!? If what the defense says is correct... ...why, that contradicts the entire testimony we've just heard!
Apollo:
Well, Mr. Brushel? Anything to say... on the record!?
Brushel:
Slow-acting. S-L-O-W A-C-T... It was virulent, alright. Even then, it had already begun digging its claws into the journalist.
Trucy:
...He's working on his scoop.
Apollo:
(*sigh*)
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...It's "Brushel", ja? Herr Brushel... let's take a trip back down memory lane.
Brushel:
Huh?
Klavier:
Did the victim really die the instant he took a sip? Think it over. This is vital.
Brushel:
You know what I think? I think that was... "A Not-So-Subliminal Suggestion"... end quote.
Klavier:
I admit, it does cause a problem if he died when you say he died. ...I would be forced to say auf Wiedersehen to my simple case. And you would be forced to say farewell to your article.
Brushel:
Come again?
Klavier:
You can't write a story based on conjecture, can you? And as the case drags on, other reporters will pick up the scent. ...And you'll be forced to kiss your exclusive scoop goodbye.
Brushel:
Scoop... Scoop... .....................! Look, wait. Just wait a second. Just one second.
Judge:
We're waiting, we're waiting! Out with it!
Brushel:
I think I just recalled a so-called "important detail"! "A Revival of Recollection", end quote! "A Story's Survival", end quote!
Apollo:
"Attorney Utterly Confused", end quote.
Brushel:
Actually, I did notice something when I visited the studio. I'd heard of poison that "takes its sweet time", see!
Klavier:
...But not what I've been saying for the last few minutes, apparently.
Judge:
Mr. Brushel! Are you saying you noticed something that explains what happened!?
Brushel:
You bet I am! The "Antidote For A Poisonous Contradiction", end quote, you might say!
Apollo:
Or "I Still Have No Idea What You're Talking About", end quote, I might say.
Brushel:
I figured it out, but only after an in-depth interview! See, thanks to my journalism skills, I know who poisoned that coffee!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Klavier:
As far as I can tell, the witness is standing by his testimony. ...That Mr. Misham died the instant after he drank.
Brushel:
Of course I'm standing by my testimony! ...And my dream of exclusive rights to this story!
Klavier:
...Ach. I suppose it was too much to hope for.
Apollo:
What was?
Klavier:
Of course he wouldn't choose a simple case, not him.
Judge:
"Him"...?
Klavier:
Phoenix Wright, who else?
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
Achtung, Herr Brushel! Report for us, if you would. What is it that you noticed?
Brushel:
......
Judge:
This court is a critical trial of the Jurist System. I'm afraid no room for doubt is permissible. You will testify to the court about what you noticed!
Witness Testimony
-- What Brushel Noticed --
Brushel:
When I arrived at the studio, Mr. Misham was at his desk.He seemed to be writing a letter... but he quickly sealed the envelope.I thought nothing of it at the time, of course.Now that I think about it, what if he was writing a suicide note!?
Judge:
Hmm... A suicide note?
Brushel:
Yes... he had this look on his face. "Man's Face Inscrutable As A Quadratic Equation", end quote.
Trucy:
Suicide? Poor Mr. Misham... But that means Vera's innocent!
Apollo:
Would someone commit suicide in the middle of an interview?
Trucy:
Oh.
Judge:
Very well, you may begin your cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- What Brushel Noticed --
Brushel:
When I arrived at the studio, Mr. Misham was at his desk.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Was there anyone at the studio other than Mr. Misham?
Brushel:
Well, his daughter Vera, of course.
Apollo:
Was anyone besides Mr. Misham and Vera present?
Brushel:
Not a single one. Not a cat, not a rat, not even a mouse.
Apollo:
The only person who didn't belong to that studio there... ...was you, wasn't it, Mr. Brushel?
Brushel:
Ah. Ah! I know what you're doing! I know your game! "Attorney Uses Classic Ramsden Phenomenon Ploy", end quote.
Klavier:
If you intend to suggest that this reporter is a suspect... ...I'm sure you also intend to present evidence supporting that assertion, correct? In the meantime, let's move along, shall we?
Brushel:
He seemed to be writing a letter... but he quickly sealed the envelope.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
So he put the letter away when he saw you?
Brushel:
"Early Reporter Gets Worm", end quote. ...That's my secret!
Apollo:
I'm not sure I follow.
Brushel:
It's the night of the interview. I arrive 15 minutes ahead of schedule! The handle turns, the door opens, and I barge in!
Apollo:
Are you sure that's OK to do? I mean, isn't that unlawful entry, really?
Brushel:
Mr. Misham sure seemed to think so! You shoulda seen him! He crammed his letter into that yellow envelope as fast as he could. I know a secret when I spot one, and that was one!
Judge:
It does seem significant. Well, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
(I wonder... It does have the ring of something important...)
Add to testimony
Apollo:
The defense finds this testimony vital, Your Honor!
Judge:
Very well, please add it to the testimony then.
Brushel:
Hey, why not? My "account" comes free of charge!
Adds statement "It was a yellow envelope. ...I heard it was left at the crime scene."
No need
Apollo:
(I can't see what, though. Nothing seemed unusual.) ...It won't be necessary to add this to the testimony, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well, please continue with your testimony!
Brushel:
You got it!
Leads back to cross-examination
Press (after adding statement)
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
So he put the letter away when he saw you?
Brushel:
"Early Reporter Gets Worm", end quote. ...That's my secret!
Apollo:
I'm not sure I follow.
Brushel:

Brushel:
Mr. Misham sure seemed to think so! You shoulda seen him! He crammed his letter into that yellow envelope as fast as he could. I know a secret when I spot one, and that was one!
Apollo:
Maybe you could tell us a bit more about this envelope?
Brushel:
I thought nothing of it at the time, of course.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You didn't think anything might be wrong at the time?
Brushel:
Hey, when I go in for an interview, that's what I'm there to do. "Interviewer Finds Looking More Effective Than Caring", end quote.
Apollo:
So what about now? Thinking back on it, did you sense anything strange in Mr. Misham's behavior?
Brushel:
Well, yeah, that's why I'm telling you all this to begin with!
Judge:
Very well, continue with your testimony.
Brushel:
Now that I think about it, what if he was writing a suicide note!?
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
A "suicide note"...?
Brushel:
Well, yeah, don't quote me or anything. I'm just saying it's a possibility, you know?
Apollo:
So you didn't actually check the letter.
Brushel:
Of course not! It was sealed! "Contents Of Can Unknown Until Can Is Opened", end quote.
Apollo:
...You can always check the label.
Brushel:
It was a yellow envelope. ...I heard it was left at the crime scene.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
And you saw him seal this yellow envelope with the letter?
Brushel:
Hey, don't look at me like that! I saw what I saw.
Trucy:
Apollo! You think this might be...
Apollo:
...Our big break. Yeah. (What I need is to show some decisive evidence now...)
Present Red Envelope
Apollo:
Objection!
Leads to:
"As it just so happens, there was a single letter in a desk drawer at the scene."
Trucy:
Do you think Mr. Misham was writing a suicide note?
Apollo:
If he was, that would solve the case in a jiffy.
Trucy:
It kind of makes me wonder about that letter...
Apollo:
As it just so happens, there was a single letter in a desk drawer at the scene. In a red envelope!
Brushel:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Apollo:
...Prosecutor Gavin!
Klavier:
...Yes?
Apollo:
Was a yellow envelope found at the scene of the crime?
Klavier:
...Unfortunately no. But, Herr Forehead... ...it's easy to mistake the color of an envelope.
Apollo:
I guess. But not this envelope. You see, it was postmarked already. Seven years ago.
Judge:
Well, Mr. Brushel?
Brushel:
...I can explain that. Drew, right, he wanted to get that letter in an envelope, pronto! Get it out of sight of my beady eyes, right? So he grabbed the nearest envelope and crammed away!
Apollo:
(And what about the whole red and yellow envelope contradiction, chump!?)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? Have you anything to say to the witness's claim?
Apollo:
"That night, the victim put a letter he had been writing in a red envelope"...
It's possible
Apollo:
It's entirely possible!
Trucy:
But Apollo! We checked the contents of that envelope yesterday, didn't we?
Apollo:
Oh... You're right! (Gah! The answer was clear if I'd only given it a little thought...)
Leads to:
"...As it just so happens, the defense team investigated the contents of this envelope!"
It's impossible
Apollo:
That's impossible.
Klavier:
Ah, I like your expression. So full of confidence.
Apollo:
It's simple, really.
Leads to:
"...As it just so happens, the defense team investigated the contents of this envelope!"
Apollo:
...As it just so happens, the defense team investigated the contents of this envelope! With, erm, the assistance of a forensic scientist.
Klavier:
What...?
Apollo:
Note that this letter is addressed to "Drew Misham".
Brushel:
Oh?
Apollo:
Why would he address a letter to himself? Let alone send a suicide note to himself!
Brushel:
...... I... I've been scooped!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! Mr. Brushel! Can you explain this to the court?
Brushel:
Oh, my, my, my. How could I have forgotten? I suppose this happens to the best of us! "Reporter Gets Old, Forgets Lots", end quote.
Judge:
I'm still waiting for an explanation, Mr. Brushel!
Brushel:
Well, that's the thing, see. After he put his letter in that envelope... ...Mr. Misham sat there searching his desk drawer for something!
Apollo:
His desk drawer...?
Brushel:
Yes! A stamp! A so-called "Postage Stamp", end quote!
Judge:
A stamp? Whatever for?
Brushel:
Well, to mail his letter, what else? And then, why yes, I think I saw him put it in his letter box. Yes, it was a yellow envelope, and he put it in that box!
Judge:
Well, apparently, this yellow letter has nothing to do with this case.
Brushel:
Oh, how I wish it did! Just think if that were a suicide note... What a story! "Star Writes Suicide Note In Front Of Reporter, Falls", end quote.
Judge:
Ahem. As I was saying, that has nothing to do with this case! That said.
Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
It makes me wonder about the contents of that red envelope. $100,000 is quite a good deal of money!
Klavier:
So this was from seven years ago, ja...?
Brushel:
...! So, am I finished? Here, I mean. Am I finished here? I was thinking of, you know, going home, to start writing...
Apollo:
...Um, I hate to state what should be pretty obvious to anyone... ...but when you catch the scent of a story... ...you make that... er, rather unique face.
Brushel:
Ack! C-C'mon! "Attorney Has Active Imagination, Little Else", end quote.
Judge:
Even I noticed something, and my eyes aren't what they used to be. You know, I'm starting to understand what all this "perceiving" stuff is about!
Apollo:
("Judge Has Active Imagination"... end quote.)
Judge:
Please, continue with your testimony. Tell us about the scent of a story!
Brushel:
Hey... I'm the one asking the questions here. Usually.
Witness Testimony
-- The Scent Of A Story --
Brushel:
Actually, it took a bit of work to get a thumbs-up on the interview."Reporter Leverages Story, Gets His Interview", end quote.The story concerned a certain case from seven years ago.That red envelope probably had something to do with it.Say what you will, but Drew's talent was without compare.
Judge:
So you threatened to go to press with this "story"? That's how you got your interview? Blackmail?
Brushel:
Well, yes. ... I mean no! No, no, no, no! It wasn't exactly black... I mean, I'm not... urk!
Judge:
...Something wrong, Mr. Brushel?
Brushel:
L-Look! This is my story! My tidbit! "Journalist's Into Is Livelihood", end quote.
Judge:
...I see.
Brushel:
While you have me chatting away in here, what's going on out there? What if some Wally Wordsworth or Sally Scooper gets wind of my story? They could be going to press while I'm going to waste!
Judge:
The court feels your pain, Mr. Brushel. Mr. Justice, let's pick up the pace.
Apollo:
(A certain case, seven years ago... Wait... "seven years ago"?)
Trucy:
...?
Cross Examination
-- The Scent Of A Story --
Brushel:
Actually, it took a bit of work to get a thumbs-up on the interview.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
The victim, Drew Misham, had an aversion to reporters?
Brushel:
Boy, I guess. Not even my considerable charms did much for him. Until I finally got my thumbs-up, that is.
Klavier:
Maybe you can elaborate on that a bit for us?
Brushel:
"Reporter Leverages Story, Gets His Interview", end quote.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
...Exactly what sort of story was this?
Brushel:
Oh a little one. Like I said. "Nothing More, Nothing Less, Nothing In-Between", end quote. I might have suggested I had a lead on this particular story. But I didn't threaten, or cajole, or nothing! Honest!
Apollo:
(So a suggestion was enough to get an interview? Mr. Misham must have really wanted to keep it under wraps...)
Brushel:
The story concerned a certain case from seven years ago.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
A certain case, seven years ago? Tell us! What case!?
Brushel:
Let me state one thing, Mr. Attorney, and you can quote me on this! I... can't talk about that case!
Apollo:
Wh-Why not!?
Brushel:
It's about journalistic pride, and staunchness, and credibility, and connections! "Journalist Reveals Sources Only Over His Dead Body", end quote. So what'll it be? Gonna strangle me? Dead men don't tell tales, Mr. Attorney!
Apollo:
(He sounds pretty determined not to talk.)
Trucy:
Hmm. Our chances of breaking his will aren't looking good.
Brushel:
That red envelope probably had something to do with it.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
On the one hand we have your "story", and on the other, this letter. What makes you think the two are related?
Brushel:
Oh! Ah, er, I was just saying it's possible. Call it "Reporter's Intuition", end quote. Hey, I say a lot of things. You going to pick all of them apart? Be my guest!
Apollo:
(All of them? No. Just the incredibly suspicious ones.)
Judge:
...I see. Anything else to add about Mr. Misham?
Brushel:
Say what you will, but Drew's talent was without compare.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Just how amazing was "Mr. Misham's talent"?
Brushel:
Huh? Hoo wee, boy. I mean, hey! He's a star, man, a star! The flow of his brush is like a great, undulating river across the canvas! "Artist's Paints Light Up Studio Like Sun", end quote.
Apollo:
(This guy is full of wacky gestures... But that one just now was wackier than usual.)
Trucy:
He looks kind of nervous to me, Apollo.
Apollo:
Definitely. I'm sensing something different than before here... (Maybe it's time to bring out you-know-what...)
Perceive sweating armpit on "but Drew's talent"
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Leads to:
"Sweat much, Mr. Brushel?"
Trucy:
...That testimony left a bad taste in my mouth.
Apollo:
It all makes sense. Nothing jumps out as ridiculous.
Trucy:
I wonder what this "story" he's talking about is? It must have been good, to get an interview with a famous recluse like that.
Apollo:
(Something powerful enough to drag Drew Misham out of hiding. I wonder... Maybe it had something to do with Mr. Misham's art?)
Apollo:
Sweat much, Mr. Brushel?
Brushel:
Urk! Eh, yeah, well... ...a man can't help his glands, you know!
Apollo:
It's more than that. When "Mr. Misham's talent" was mentioned... ...you suddenly began to sweat buckets.
Brushel:
...Ack!
Apollo:
You're hiding something... about his talent!
Brushel:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat! Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-That's r-r-r-ridiculous!
Apollo:
(Evidence time. Let's show where Mr. Misham's true "talent" lay!) It just so happens I have evidence showing the "talent" mentioned in that letter!
Present Hidden Painting
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This painting was found in Mr. Misham's studio."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Brushel:
Er, I can't help but wonder what the court is supposed to conclude from this evidence?
Apollo:
Oh...
Brushel:
Other than that you've made a horrible mistake? "Man Burns Bridge, Forgets To Cross First", end quote.
Apollo:
(...Let's try that again. All I have to do is reveal what Mr. Misham really was. That shouldn't be so hard, right?)
Leads back to:
"It just so happens I have evidence showing the "talent" mentioned in that letter!"
Apollo:
This painting was found in Mr. Misham's studio.
Brushel:
...!
Apollo:
There are two problems with this painting. The first is it wasn't painted by Mr. Misham. The second is that there was another painting in the studio... ...which looked exactly like this one. Except it was only half done!
Brushel:
......
Apollo:
Then we have a letter discussing a payment of $100,000. Which suggests a certain business operation. The business of making forgeries!
Brushel:
Aoooooooooooooogg!
Apollo:
...That is all, Your Honor.
Brushel:
Everyone! Please, everyone! Can we keep this private? Please!? This is my story! My scoop!
Judge:
Forgery... that's a serious crime!
Brushel:
Drew Misham is known as an artist these days. But there were rumors he dabbled in another kind of art until a few years back.
Judge:
"Another art" meaning... forgery?
Brushel:
Drew Misham was talented, alright. Talented at making precise, detailed fakes. A fact that certain criminal elements were quick to discover.
Apollo:
Criminal elements...? What...!? You can't seriously be talking about...
Brushel:
...Exactly. I'm talking about forging evidence! The rumors started circulating seven years ago.
Judge:
S-Seven years ago...? So, are we to understand that this letter... ...this payment of $100,000 was for...?
Brushel:
...Exactly. "Forged Evidence Nets Tidy Profit", end quote.
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Why, it's like our victim was living a double life!
Apollo:
(Ah ha! This is my chance!) So the victim had ties to the criminal world, right? He could have had plenty of enemies we know nothing about!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
This is my first time hearing of this "criminal world". We certainly found no criminal connections when we conducted our investigation.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
But how do you explain all this money? You have to admit there's a possibility of some illegal activity here!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...But there is no proof tying this letter to our case.
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
...Our case was, and remains, simple from the beginning. Only the defendant could have poisoned that mug that night. And, you, of course.
Brushel:
Hey, hey, hey, the only thing I poison is my pen... when I'm writing reviews!
Judge:
Mr. Brushel, your testimony to this point has been quite unreliable. ...It doesn't speak well of your reporting acumen.
Brushel:
What're you talking about!? My journalism is rock solid! "Journalism So Solid, You Could Stand An Elephant On It", end quote.
Judge:
In any case... Let's hear a summarized recap of your testimony. If we can ascertain the situation in that studio from the recap, the trial is over.
Trucy:
Apollo! What's he talking about?
Apollo:
The cross-examination showed Mr. Brushel didn't have reason or means to poison him. As long as there're no other suspects... ...then the killer had to be Vera. That's what. ...This next testimony is our last chance!
Judge:
Mr. Brushel, your testimony please!
Witness Testimony
-- The Interview: A Recap --
Brushel:
The only other person in the studio that night was the defendant.It was Vera who poured the coffee. She's admitted as much herself.The only thing that touched Drew's lips during the interview was that mug.And nothing left that studio after he died. Nothing....Clearly, the only one who could have poisoned him was his daughter!
Klavier:
A nice testimony. Clear, succinct... and without room for doubt.
Brushel:
Aw... Shucks. You really think so?
Judge:
I believe this clarifies the situation that night. Very well, Mr. Justice. You may begin your final cross-examination!
Apollo:
R-Right... (...I still have one trump card left to play. And I won't let this trial end until I use it!)
Cross Examination

Brushel:
The only other person in the studio that night was the defendant.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
But that doesn't prove Vera poisoned it!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
How many times have we heard that one, Herr Forehead? The poison reached its victim via that coffee mug. And from where did that coffee come, hmm?
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
Not to beat a dead horse again, and again, but perhaps you could fill us in?
Brushel:
I'm on it! You need a horse beat? I'm your man!
Brushel:
It was Vera who poured the coffee. She's admitted as much herself.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
And you witnessed her pouring the coffee?
Brushel:
Course I didn't witness it! When she came in with that tray... ...the coffee was already poured and a-steamin'.
Klavier:
...Let us not forget the defendant has admitted to pouring the coffee herself. I heard her statement: "I poured, I served, and I killed."
Apollo:
...Wha--!?
Klavier:
Ah ha ha ha ha. That last part was just a little joke.
Apollo:
(I don't think I'm going to get anywhere with this coffee mug. I need to find another weak spot in this case.)
Brushel:
The only thing that touched Drew's lips during the interview was that mug.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
...You're sure about that?
Brushel:
Well, to be really, really, precise... ...I was busy gobbling mint candies the whole time.
Apollo:
One of those candies might have been poisoned!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Yet, at the time of the autopsy, no fresh fragrance of mint filled the room. ...And no "mint residue" was found.
Apollo:
...! (It was a long shot anyway.)
Klavier:
Don't tell me you're still trying to prove this? You think the victim ate, drank, or otherwise ingested something other than coffee?
Judge:
Hmm. Well, Mr. Justice? If you have some proof...
Apollo:
(The possibility is there, I can feel it. Just maybe not prove it, not yet. And possibility isn't going to cut it, not now!) Mr. Misham ingested that poison via a route other than that coffee!
I can prove it. (before changing fourth statement)
Apollo:
Proof... is possible. (I gotta risk it...)
Judge:
Oh? Excellent. Let's see your proof then. Please show us your evidence! What evidence shows that the victim wasn't poisoned via his coffee mug?
Present anything
Apollo:
Take that!
Klavier:
Must I explain this over and over and over? We don't need possibilities, here, Herr Forehead. We need proof.
Apollo:
I-I know that!
Klavier:
You should also know that every proof has its moment. Perhaps you're a bit early?
Judge:
...I can tell you what we know at this point: The victim put nothing to his mouth but that coffee mug.
Apollo:
(*sigh* Another hole in this case that needs plugging before I can prove anything. But first things first. I'd better uncover a weak spot before I try to strike again!)
Judge:
On with the cross-examination!
Leads back to cross-examination
I can prove it. (after changing fourth statement)
Leads to:
"Proof is... possible."
Not yet (before changing fourth statement)
Apollo:
It... can't be proven.
Klavier:
...I do believe our little Forehead is growing up. Pity. We liked the rash, youthful Forehead best.
Apollo:
(*sigh* Another hole in this case that needs plugging before I can prove anything. But first things first. I'd better uncover a weak spot before I try to strike again!)

Apollo:
It... can't be proven.
Klavier:
...I do believe our little Forehead is growing up. Pity. We liked the rash, youthful Forehead best.
Apollo:
(Wait a second... We already know a letter might have left the studio that night. Couldn't that have opened another path for poisoning? The situation's already changed... I just need to take advantage of it!)
Judge:
Let's continue with the cross-examination.
Leads back to cross-examination
Brushel:
And nothing left that studio after he died. Nothing.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Not one thing...? You're sure?
Brushel:
Yep, sure as sure can be. ...Well, with one exception.
Judge:
One exception!? What!?
Brushel:
"Journalist Spark Brushel Does Interview, Leaves Studio", end quote. Ah. Ah ha ha! C'mon! It's a joke! Get it? Not funny, I know, but still!
Apollo:
(Did something leave the studio that night? Why does that sound familiar? Where have I heard something like that before...?)
Judge:
Now that we've proven our witness is a comedian of sorts... ...I'd like to turn to our defense attorney before returning to the testimony. Do you have any idea what, if anything, might have left the studio that night?
Not a thing
Apollo:
...... (I can't think of a single thing!) ...If anything did leave, wouldn't Mr. Brushel have noticed?
Brushel:
That I would, that I would! Nothing left! Save myself, of course.
Judge:
Say that again and you'll be held in contempt of court. Let's get back to the cross-examination, then!
Leads back to cross-examination
Just one thing
Apollo:
I think one thing might very well have left the studio that night, actually. A certain something that has vanished from the crime scene.
Judge:
By which you mean... ...something other than our witness?
Apollo:
...Of course.
Klavier:
Don't tell me. "Vera Misham"?
Apollo:
Believe me, any comic relief I may provide is entirely unintentional.
Judge:
Then, let's see what you've got for us, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
Well, this thing wasn't at the scene of the crime, so I can't show it to you. But I do have evidence that shows how it could have been taken from the scene!
Present Letter Box
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is the only link between that studio and the outside world."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
......
Klavier:
......
Brushel:
...I find Prosecutor Gavin more amusing than this guy, really.
Klavier:
If that was comic relief, why do I not feel amused?
Judge:
We want evidence, not entertainment, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
(There goes my career in stand-up...)
Leads back to:
"Well, this thing wasn't at the scene of the crime, so I can't show it to you."
Apollo:
This is the only link between that studio and the outside world.
Judge:
A letter box?
Apollo:
What did Mr. Brushel just tell us? When he entered the studio on the night of the murder... ...the victim had just finished writing a letter!
Brushel:
Yeah, I said that. And yeah, it was true.
Apollo:
Furthermore, you went on to tell us... ...that he put the letter in a yellow envelope and put it in the letter box.
Judge:
Ah...!
Apollo:
But that very same letter box was empty! In other words... ...that night, the "yellow envelope" disappeared!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...Ah, yes, intriguing. So an envelope has disappeared from the scene of the crime. Of course... this changes nothing.
Apollo:
Huh...?
Judge:
He has a point, Mr. Justice. What we're trying to figure out here is how the poison got into Mr. Misham. Is it really important that this envelope the witness says he saw disappeared?
Apollo:
Well, if it did disappear, then something did leave the studio that night. That seems very important to me!
Judge:
Very well then. The witness will add this to his testimony.
Brushel:
You got it.
Klavier:
...I still think this fails to change anything, Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
(I wouldn't be so sure. A letter disappeared from the crime scene that night... This is exactly the opening I've been looking for!)
Changes statement from "And nothing left that studio after he died. Nothing." to "A letter was put in the post from the studio, but I hardly think that matters."
Brushel:
A letter was put in the post from the studio, but I hardly think that matters.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Nothing could be more serious than an envelope disappearing from that studio! And you were hiding that fact from us!
Brushel:
Er, yes, well, actually...
Klavier:
I don't argue the possibility that a letter disappeared from that studio. ...But Herr Forehead, isn't there a much more serious question before us?
Apollo:
(...Right, how Mr. Misham was poisoned. I know. But Mr. Brushel's testimony has changed, which means the facts of the case have, too. And what he's told us means something entirely different now, I'm starting to think.)
Trucy:
Let's keep thinking, Apollo!
Brushel:
...Clearly, the only one who could have poisoned him was his daughter!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You say "clearly" as though it were obvious. But this claim that the defendant poisoned the victim is merely conjecture!
Brushel:
Ah, yes, well, you see... In my business, it's all about making the most ridiculous things sound right. A bad habit, I know.
Judge:
......
Klavier:
......
Brushel:
Yes, well, er, actually... ...I guess this is more a case of "Ridiculous Journalist Sounds Wrong", end quote.
Judge:
The court is forced to agree with you. Please refrain from wild conjecture.
Brushel:
Understoodloudandclear!
Apollo:
(If only I could believe that.)
Trucy:
What do you think, Apollo? Everything he's saying seems so... not flawed!
Apollo:
...Well, that's kind of what you want from a testimony, really. (...I need to keep my eye on what matters. How, and why, was Drew Misham, killed? Vera poured the coffee, that's not going to change. But if that coffee didn't kill him, I need to find what did... and prove it!)
Apollo:
Proof is... possible. (Here goes nothing...)
Klavier:
You do understand what we need, ja? Proof, Herr Forehead. Not "possibilities".
Apollo:
Of course. And, Prosecutor Gavin, I hope you understand... ...I'm ready to give you that proof.
Klavier:
Wh-What did you say?
Apollo:
I have proof of the disappearing envelope!
Brushel:
I saw him writing a letter, I did!
Judge:
...Which was picked up by the mailman, I assume?
Apollo:
Of course, which means... ...that envelope had a stamp on it.
Judge:
A stamp... Ah..................
Apollo:
As we all know, stamps come with dried glue on the back. In order to use the glue you have to wet it... ...by licking the stamp!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Feh. No one worth talking to actually licks stamps in this day and age.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Even if you wanted to talk to him, you couldn't. ...He's dead, after all.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
OK, so he licked the stamp. But wait! How does that explain the atroquinine on the rim of the coffee mug?
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
If he licked the back of a poisoned stamp, the poison would get on his tongue, yes? What would then happen if he put the coffee mug to his mouth, hmm?
Klavier:
...!
Apollo:
Those traces on the mug weren't the killer's doing! It was the other way around!
Judge:
What!?
Apollo:
The coffee mug didn't poison Mr. Misham... ...Mr. Misham poisoned the coffee mug himself!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! B-But that doesn't... Does it?
Apollo:
Recall, if you would... ...atroquinine is a slow-acting poison, yes? The poison entered his body when he put the stamp on that envelope. But his time wasn't up until the very moment he touched his lips to that cup of joe.
Judge:
You have something to add, Mr. Brushel?
Apollo:
(Uh oh. His nose is picking up another scent...)
Brushel:
As I believe I mentioned earlier.
Brushel:
Well, that's the thing, see. After he put his letter in that envelope... ...Mr. Misham sat there searching his desk drawer for something! Yes! A stamp! A so-called "Postage Stamp", end quote!
Brushel:
But you know, I don't seem to remember him ever finding one.
Judge:
Maybe he'd just run out?
Klavier:
Incidentally, we searched the desk drawer at the scene of the crime. There were no stamps. Not a single one.
Apollo:
...!
Judge:
Hmm, that does pose a problem. How will you prove that the stamp was coated with poison?
Apollo:
Actually, I'm glad no other stamps were found. It makes proving the stamp he used was poisoned possible!
Klavier:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha. ...Good show, good show. You can't even prove there was a stamp at the scene in the first place!
Judge:
...Well, let's hear what the defense has to say anyway. Where's your evidence that proves the existence of this poisoned stamp?
Present Tiny Frame
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Well, that certainly is a cute little frame. And by little, I mean really little."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
...... Well, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
I think our beloved attorney has been licking too many stamps in his free time.
Apollo:
(Grr... Do you smile like that when you torture all your victims, or just me?)
Judge:
Take care that we don't lick you and stick you in the letter box, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
(...I think I'm making this out to be way more complicated than it really is. That stamp would have left a small atroquinine residue on something... But what?)
Leads back to:
"...Well, let's hear what the defense has to say anyway."
Judge:
Well, that certainly is a cute little frame. And by little, I mean really little.
Apollo:
It was on the victim's desk, Your Honor. ...Quite empty, as you can see for yourself.
Klavier:
I noticed that too during my inspection. So what?
Apollo:
Ah, apparently you weren't as observant as you should have been. You see, when you saw this frame, it was missing something quite important.
Judge:
"Missing" something...?
Apollo:
Yes. A pale bluish stain on the inside of the frame... Atroquinine residue!
Klavier:
What!? Why wasn't I told about this!?
Apollo:
The frame is only two inches square. The face of the frame is even smaller. Maybe an inch wide at most.
Klavier:
You aren't saying...
Apollo:
...Oh, but I am. Tell me: what fits in such a small frame? A commemorative stamp, perhaps?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! The poisoned stamp was in this frame...!?
Klavier:
Impossible!
Judge:
P-Prosecutor Gavin...!
Klavier:
Why would he put something like that on his desk? Don't tell me he had it there so he could commit suicide if the mood struck!
Brushel:
You know, can I say something? I had a thought, see!
Judge:
What, Mr. Brushel, and please stop jittering around like that!
Brushel:
The victim was a forger, right? There's a lot of money in that line of work. "Forger Forges Friends, Makes Enemies, Too", end quote.
Apollo:
So the poisoned stamp might have been a murder weapon, aimed at him!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...Oh, rich. That's rich. Leave the ridiculous flights of fancy to the Gavinners's song lyrics, please.
Apollo:
(Finally, something we agree on.)
Klavier:
The stamp was a "murder weapon"? Nonsense! Murder is a simple business. Who would go to such lengths? No one.
Apollo:
Oh, I disagree.
Klavier:
C-Come again...?
Apollo:
Recall, if you would, the victim's reclusive lifestyle. Drew Misham hid from the world. He avoided meetings. His only contact with the outside world... was the mail.
Judge:
The... mail!
Apollo:
Now, if you wanted to kill someone you couldn't meet, but you knew read letters... ...a stamp would be the perfect weapon!
Klavier:
Ridiculous! Where's your proof? I want proof! Show us evidence that this poisoned stamp was sent to him... as a murder weapon!
Apollo:
(I might not have "evidence" per se... But things are finally starting to come together!)
Trucy:
Wh-What is it, Apollo? Your fists are trembling!
Apollo:
I think I know what happened! I don't believe it... but I can see it! I think I know how Mr. Misham was killed!
Judge:
Well, fill us in, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
...A certain piece of evidence points to the truth, Your Honor. I can show you how someone with the intent to kill sent Mr. Misham the stamp of death!
Present Red Envelope
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Isn't this the envelope... the one from seven years ago?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
...... I'm not sure it's entirely clear to me what this proves, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
Huh...? (Was I wrong?)
Klavier:
I believe we have shown probable "intent to kill". Except the killer would be Herr Judge, and the victim, you!
Apollo:
Yeeeeargh!
Judge:
Consider that a warning, Mr. Justice. Think before presenting next time.
Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor. (Let's think this one over again.)
Leads back to:
"...A certain piece of evidence points to the truth, Your Honor."
Judge:
Isn't this the envelope... the one from seven years ago?
Apollo:
Think about the text of the letter again. There were two pages in the envelope. This is page one. ...And this is page two. I want to draw your attention to one phrase in particular. "...Send in the enclosed envelope with the enclosed stamp within 3 days." The enclosed stamp, Your Honor.
Judge:
Ah...!
Brushel:
In other words, if I have this straight... "The Stamp! Poison! On The Stamp! Lick, Lick, Gasp..." end quote!
Apollo:
Now, what if he had done exactly as the letter asked?
Trucy:
He would sign the document, put it in the envelope... and put the stamp on it, right? Then he would put it in his letter box...!
Apollo:
Fifteen minutes wouldn't have elapsed between affixing the stamp, and mailing the letter. But the clock started ticking, and when the time came... he drew his last breath. And the murder weapon would be taken away from the scene.
Judge:
...Quite conveniently, thanks to the postal system!
Klavier:
...Such a splendid imagination you have, Herr Forehead!
Apollo:
......
Klavier:
Let me confirm one thing with you, if I might. So, this "poisoned stamp" was inside this envelope from seven years ago... ja? Is that what you'd have us believe? Really?
Apollo:
...W-Well...
Trucy:
It is a little bit of a stretch, but there's a possibility.
Klavier:
Yes. A very small possibility. How small, I wonder?
Trucy:
Um...
Klavier:
A poisoned stamp in this envelope? A stamp that then became the murder weapon? How do you intend to prove this seeming coincidence?
Trucy:
W-Well...
Apollo:
(Ack! It was seven years ago, and we don't even know who sent that letter!)
Klavier:
And your answer... is silence, I see. Very well! I move to...
???:
...It's not nice to pick on the Fräulein, Klavier.
Klavier:
...!
Apollo:
Ah... Ema!
Ema:
Well? Like my Kristoph Gavin impression? Did I sound like him?
Apollo:
...Don't quit your day job.
Klavier:
Don't you have a crime scene to be looking after, Fräulein Detective?
Ema:
Someone had to come dig you all out of the mess you're making of this case.
Apollo:
Mess...?
Ema:
You know, none of this would happen if you just trusted in science a little more. You can find out if that stamp was in that envelope, easy.
Klavier:
Care to explain yourself, Fräulein Detective?
Ema:
Glare at me all you want, but science is on my side. It's all in the residue, right?
Apollo:
That's right! The poison detection spray...
Judge:
Produce the red envelope at once! You can open it on the authority of the court!
Spray on bottom right
Leads to:
"Well! Would you look at that!"
Judge:
Well! Would you look at that!
Ema:
No mistaking it. That's atroquinine residue!
Judge:
I-I don't believe it... A murder weapon from the past... Now, seven years later, it bares its fangs at last!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Absolutely outrageous! ...Tell me why! Why didn't this murder take place seven years ago!?
Apollo:
Well, um...
Ema:
There's one possibility. Maybe Mr. Misham figured it out.
Judge:
Figured what out?
Ema:
He realized that the person who sent that letter wanted him dead. So he sent his reply with a different stamp.
Judge:
...And put his decisive evidence in a frame.
Hold it!
Brushel:
......
Judge:
Ack! You're still here!?
Brushel:
C-Can I make a statement here, on the record? I, Spark "Razortooth" Brushel, claim this scoop as mine! "Drew Misham Killed In Cold Blood... ...By Sender Of Seven-Year-Old Letter!" end quote. Hmm, no, maybe something more succinct. "Star Falls After 7 Year Delay", end quote.
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! I see no room for further argument here. Though I admit, this is all coming as quite a shock. To think that the murder weapon reached his mouth after seven years...! "Stamp Is Ticket Straight To Afterlife", end quote!
Trucy:
Uh oh. I think the witness is a bad influence on our judge.
Judge:
...I see no need for further debate on this matter. The sender of that letter seven years ago could hardly have been our defendant!
Trucy:
A-Apollo!
Apollo:
I think we just won!
Judge:
...Very well! This court finds the defendant...
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...Is this the bright future of our legal system?
Judge:
Prosecutor... Gavin?
Klavier:
A ticket to the afterlife from seven years ago...? Tickets for Gavinners's shows are invalid after two weeks.
Judge:
B-But it doesn't make sense any other way!
Klavier:
...It boggles my mind that so many people haven't noticed this. There's a fatal contradiction in Herr Forehead's claim!
Apollo:
A c-contradiction?
Klavier:
A poisoned stamp was placed in this envelope seven years ago. Whereupon it was framed, until now. If that's the case, then why would Drew Misham have done what he did?
Apollo:
E-Ema explained that! He must have realized it was poisoned!
Klavier:
...Therein lies the rub.
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
Seven years ago, the forger Drew Misham sensed a trap, and put the stamp in a frame. I do not debate this. ...But this begs the question. Why, seven years later, did he use that stamp on the night of the murder?
Apollo:
Ah...!
Klavier:
Surely, you don't mean to suggest that Mr. Misham simply "forgot"? He put the murder weapon in a frame on his desk for seven years... and forgot? You expect us to believe he sprang the trap on himself?
Apollo:
...... Uh... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh!
Judge:
While I admit, this is all quite shocking, myself... ...it does seem highly unlikely that he would fall afoul of a trap... ...that had been sitting on his desk for seven years!
Trucy:
A-Apollo!
Apollo:
I don't think we're winning anymore.
Klavier:
Ah, I'm glad to see we're all back in the real world now. Welcome back to reality! We've been waiting for you.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
OK... Then how do you explain the poisoned stamp that was in this envelope?
Klavier:
The "poisoned stamp"...? Where exactly is this poisoned stamp, again? Have you brought it to court for us?
Apollo:
Uh...
Klavier:
I see no proof that such a thing ever existed.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
What about the atroquinine residue, huh!?
Klavier:
Oh, I agree, that does seem to be atroquinine residue. But, Herr Forehead, it's certainly no stamp.
Apollo:
...! Y-Yeah, but...
Klavier:
Even if your precious poisoned stamp did exist... ...Drew Misham never would have used it. ...That is all.
Apollo:
...... Urk.
Judge:
I believe we've come to a conclusion. Again.
Trucy:
A-Apollo! Were we wrong the whole time?
Apollo:
I-I can't believe it! The poison traces match up! It can't be coincidence!
Judge:
I'd like to bring some closure to this issue, sometime this year. ...Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
...Yes, Your Honor!
Judge:
Let's review the facts, and see where we stand. Seven years ago, Drew Misham received a red envelope. There were traces of the poison atroquinine on the document inside that envelope. A similar trace was also found at the crime scene... ...on this tiny picture frame. The defense has indicated the possibility of a yellow envelope. An envelope that left the scene of the crime with the poisoned stamp on it.
Klavier:
Yes, but even if this envelope contained a poisoned stamp... ...and Drew Misham, knowing this, put it in a frame... ...he never would have used that stamp!
Judge:
...I'm afraid you're right. Which means there is a fatal flaw in the defense's case!
Apollo:
(I haven't been on the wrong track this whole time, I'm sure of it! The traces of atroquinine, the envelope, the frame... ...and Drew Misham's mysterious death... They're all connected somehow!)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice, do you have a conclusion for us?
Apollo:
...The defense stands by its case, Your Honor. We've seen that the logical outcome of the evidence makes no sense. Which means that one of our clues... must be a fake.
Klavier:
Ah, a fake clue? Fascinating! And if we find this fake, your wild fantasies will prove quite reasonable, ja?
Apollo:
The fake clue that's thrown us off the poison's trail is none other than...
the red envelope.
Judge:
This red envelope... is a fake?
Apollo:
...Without a doubt, Your Honor.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...Wasn't it you who presented this evidence to the court?
Apollo:
...Oh.
Trucy:
Hold on a second, Apollo! The poison on that envelope, the frame, and the coffee mug... They're all connected somehow!
Apollo:
Oh... right! (*sigh* I can hear it already. "It looks like the fake... was you, Herr Forehead!")
Trucy:
Now's no time for wallowing in self-pity! Let's get thinking, Apollo!
Leads back to:
"The fake clue that's thrown us off the poison's trail is none other than..."
the frame.
Judge:
This frame... is the "fake" clue?
Apollo:
...Without a doubt, Your Honor.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...Wasn't it you who presented this evidence to the court?
Apollo:
...Oh.
Trucy:
Hold on a second, Apollo! The poison on that envelope, the frame, and the coffee mug... They're all connected somehow!
Apollo:
Oh... right! (*sigh* I can hear it already. "It looks like the fake... was you, Herr Forehead!")
Trucy:
We can flog ourselves later, Apollo! Now's the time for thinking!
Leads back to:
"The fake clue that's thrown us off the poison's trail is none other than..."
Drew Misham.
Leads to:
"Th-the victim was a "fake clue"? I'm afraid I don't understand."
Judge:
Th-the victim was a "fake clue"? I'm afraid I don't understand.
Apollo:
...I'll explain. We have an envelope, a frame, and a mug, linked by poison. That all makes sense. What doesn't make sense is the victim himself!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...Congratulations. You've completely lost me. So the fake evidence is none other than the master of fake himself, the forger? ...It makes a good story, I'll give you that.
Apollo:
(The fake clue... Fakes... forgeries...) Ah...!
Trucy:
I know that face! That's the "I just had an idea" face!
Apollo:
I don't know if I'm right... but I'm going with it anyway! What if our "forger" is the "fake"!?
Klavier:
...Come again?
Apollo:
Seven years ago, our forger sniffed a trap, and stepped aside. ...Seven years passed. Now the forger stumbles into that very same trap, and dies. ...Why?
Judge:
That's what I want to know!
Apollo:
Because the forger who was killed... was a fake.
Klavier:
Here we are again. The victim... was a "fake"?
Apollo:
One forger smelled the trap. One forger fell into the trap. That's two forgers! And one of them was a fake!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!!
Klavier:
So you are telling us that Drew Misham, the victim, was a fake? Well, if he was the fake, who was the real forger? You'd better not be claiming there was some kind of switcheroo?
Judge:
...I'm afraid you're going to have to back up your story. Mr. Justice. Show us just who the real Drew Misham was!
Apollo:
(If Drew Misham wasn't the real forger... ...there's only one other person it could have been!) ...Understood, Your Honor. Forger Drew Misham was himself a forgery! The real forger was...!
Present Vera Misham profile
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"There can be only one explanation, really."
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
......
Klavier:
......
Brushel:
......
Apollo:
(Ack! "Attorney Makes Wild Claim, Becomes Subject Of Mass Ridicule"... end quote! Better come up with something quick before that story goes to print...!)
Leads back to:
"Forger Drew Misham was himself a forgery!"
Apollo:
There can be only one explanation, really. The real identity of the forger known as Drew Misham is none other than... ...his only daughter, Vera Misham!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ...Mr. Justice! This is going out on a limb, even for you!
Trucy:
I kinda agree. I mean, Vera, a forger?
Apollo:
Let's consider it before you write it off entirely. If you look at the paintings in the studio, one fact becomes quite clear. Forgery had been taking place in that studio for quite some time! The forger wasn't caught in that trap seven years ago. This can only mean that the one who was caught in the trap wasn't the forger!
Judge:
Well... Actually, that does make a certain kind of sense.
Apollo:
One more thing! Only two sets of fingerprints were found in the forger's studio. Drew Misham's... and Vera Misham's.
Klavier:
......
Apollo:
If we know that Drew Misham wasn't the forger... ...that leaves only one possibility, by process of elimination. The forger was Vera Misham. ...Well?
Klavier:
...... ...Fascinating!
Judge:
Vera Misham...?
Vera:
......
Judge:
You've been paying attention to the trial so far?
Vera:
......
Klavier:
Let's just ask her and be done with it, shall we? Who are you? Who is the forger, Drew Misham?
Vera:
...... ...! ......
Apollo:
(Was that... an expression of emotion I saw on her face? She's staring holes into Prosecutor Gavin's face...)
Klavier:
...I'm used to being stared at by Fräuleins, believe me. Though they usually talk to me, too. Tell us. Were you the one who forged those works of art?
Vera:
...... ...Yes...
Apollo:
...!
Judge:
So... so the forger, Drew Misham was... you!?
Vera:
...... ...Yes, it was me...
Judge:
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Apollo:
(The court was in an uproar, and it wasn't coming down. We had to break for a ten minute recess.)
To be continued.

District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 6
Trucy:
OK... So where exactly does this leave us, Apollo?
Apollo:
Well, the Drew Misham who was killed... ...wasn't "Drew Misham the forger", basically.
Trucy:
Huh? Well then, who was he?
Apollo:
Well "he" was actually...
Vera:
......
Apollo:
(...Doing her nails.) So, you really made those forgeries?
Vera:
...... ...Yes... For Father... ...I know it was wrong...
Trucy:
Could you tell us how it happened?
Vera:
...... ...My father was a painter... ...I love painting ever since I was a child... ...One day, Father saw it in me... ...He saw that I had the "talent"...
Trucy:
The talent... for making forgeries?
Vera:
...How should I say it? It was not only paintings I made... ...Given the materials, I could make... anything...
Apollo:
Anything...?
Vera:
...Father was so proud, and I, so happy... ...But, in the end, I was making... those...
Apollo:
...Forgeries.
Vera:
...I've never had a good constitution, nor... personality... ...I know very little of the world outside my door... ...... ...Now, because of me... Father... is...
Trucy:
...Do you know about this red envelope?
Vera:
...I remember that envelope. It was some time ago...
Apollo:
So, you were already a, um... You were already creating your "works" back then?
Vera:
...I started when I was only twelve years old...
Apollo:
So the one who figured out the stamp was poisoned, that was...
Bailiff:
...Mr. Justice! It's time! To the courtroom, please!
Apollo:
R-Right! (Out of time...)
Trucy:
Wait, Vera! Just one more thing, please! Those three paintings in the studio...
Vera:
...I painted those, as part of my work...
Trucy:
Right. See, we checked them out and we saw what was underneath. We saw the rough sketches underneath the three finished paintings...
Vera:
...I see... ...... ...Mr. Justice...
Apollo:
...Yes!?
Vera:
...Father... He knew of you... ...Of both of you...
Apollo:
Your late father...?
Vera:
...He was watching, gathering information... ...All about the "Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices"...
Trucy:
B-But lately, we're not doing just law...!
Vera:
...Yes... You do tricks, gags to amuse... and play piano...
Trucy:
Well, they're not really "gags"...
Vera:
...Yet when Father heard you had resumed the legal business... ...How pleased he was...
Trucy:
...Who was Mr. Misham?
Apollo:
...How'm I supposed to know?
Trucy:
What if he was Daddy's Daddy?
Apollo:
Judging from the relative ages involved, I'd say it's highly unlikely. (Things are already confusing enough with all these daddies running around. We know that the victim's daughter, Vera, was the forger. What does this mean for the case...? Guess we're about to find out.)
October 8, 1:36 PM
District CourtCourtroom, No. 3
Judge:
Court is now back in session.
Vera:
......
Apollo:
(Vera seems pretty tense. She's practically chewing her fingernails clean off!)
Klavier:
Perhaps you could begin by telling us how it all worked. How did you set up this "Drew Misham forger" persona?
Vera:
...... ......
Apollo:
(There's that stare again... She's drilling more holes into his head.)
Trucy:
I know it's hard for you, but hey, he's a handsome guy.
Apollo:
What's "hard"!?
Judge:
Very well, miss, if you would... ...did you really make those detestable forgeries...?
Vera:
...!
Klavier:
Perhaps you'd rather answer my question? Were you the one who painted that painting. The remarkably similar one?
Vera:
...Ah... Yes... ...I painted it, yes... ...Father praised me quite highly for it...
Judge:
So... she was the one who made the forgeries.
Klavier:
Yet, she did not wish to reveal the truth of their operation. So the victim was a stand-in, a decoy. To the world at large, he was the forger, not her.
Vera:
...... ...I've done... a bad thing. I have, haven't I...?
Klavier:
Regardless, we need a little more information. About, for instance... ...this!
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
...You have seen this before, ja?
Vera:
...Y-Yes... It was in the desk drawer...
Judge:
Very well, you may proceed with your testimony. Tell us everything you know about this envelope.
Witness Testimony
-- The Red Envelope --
Vera:
...I created things and Father sold them......This envelope came after my first work... that was other than a painting......Father handled the deal, all of it......I received the stamp that was in that envelope......It was after that job that we moved to the current studio...
Judge:
Hmm... There certainly was much of great interest in your testimony.
Klavier:
...Not that the witness realizes it.
Judge:
Very well, please begin the cross-examination!
Apollo:
Right! OK! (I need more information about this "forger"... ...This "Drew Misham"...)
Cross Examination
-- The Red Envelope --
Vera:
...I created things and Father sold them...
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
So, these "things" you were making, er... ...you mean paintings identical to other paintings, right?
Vera:
...The closer they were, the happier Father was... ...I was happy, too...
Judge:
Still, you're quite young now. When did you begin this work?
Vera:
...My first painting sold when I was twelve...
Apollo:
...Your Honor! She had no idea what she was doing was illegal!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...Easy there, little attorney. You're not here to defend her for the crime of forgery.
Judge:
Hmm... true. Please, tell us more about this envelope. ...This envelope that may very well have killed your father.
Vera:
...Alright...
After pressing second, fourth, and fifth statements
Judge:
So... you really didn't know anything, did you? You had no idea how much danger you were in.
Klavier:
Apparently not.
Apollo:
...... About this "commemorative stamp". Could you tell us more about it?
Vera:
...... ...It was very pretty. And, more than that...
Apollo:
Yes?
Vera:
...It was a picture of people I liked at the time...
Apollo:
...! (This is something new!)
Klavier:
...Apparently, we've got some cross-examination yet ahead of us. If you would be so kind as to continue your testimony, Fräulein.
Vera:
......
Adds statement "...The stamp was a picture of my favorite magicians... so I kept it..."
Vera:
...This envelope came after my first work... that was other than a painting...
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
By "other than a painting", you mean... ...you'd only done paintings up to that point?
Vera:
...Yes... ...But Father had a realization... ...He noticed my talent extended to making things other than paintings...
Apollo:
For instance...?
Vera:
...For instance... a letter someone had written... ...Or a fingerprint left upon a cup... ...Or a signature on a document... a seal upon a letter...
Apollo:
(...None of this makes her sound very innocent at all!)
Klavier:
And the $100,000 promised in this letter was the start. ...The beginning of a new industry for Drew Misham.
Judge:
A new... "industry"?
Klavier:
The creation of items to be used in criminal proceedings. ...Forging evidence, in other words.
Apollo:
(Uh oh...)
After pressing first, fourth, and fifth statements
Judge:
So... you really didn't know anything, did you? You had no idea how much danger you were in.
Klavier:
Apparently not.
Apollo:
...... About this "commemorative stamp". Could you tell us more about it?
Vera:
...... ...It was very pretty. And, more than that...

Yes?

Vera:
...Father handled the deal, all of it...
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
So, you didn't know how the things you were making were being used?
Vera:
...I enjoy painting very much...
Klavier:
I think I understand. The Fräulein has lived in an... unusual little world.
Apollo:
Can you tell us what happened to the "papers" that were in this envelope?
Vera:
...Father signed them and sent them back I believe...
Apollo:
Um... did he follow the instructions? "Send in the enclosed envelope with the enclosed stamp"...
Vera:
......
Judge:
This is a rather important matter! Give your answer some thought.
Vera:
...I received the stamp that was in that envelope...
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
What do you mean, you "received" it!?
Vera:
...Did I do something wrong...?
Apollo:
Y-You didn't use that stamp because it was dangerous, correct!? Deadly poison! On the back! Atroquinine...!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...A moment, Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
You can't force an answer upon the witness. Now then. Perhaps... you would tell me, Fräulein Vera? Why did you "receive" this stamp?
Vera:
......
Judge:
Is something wrong?
Vera:
...It was... beautiful...
Judge:
...Ah. You mean it was one of those commemorative stamps?
Vera:
...Yes, I think it was...
Apollo:
So... you didn't know about the poison?
Vera:
......
Apollo:
...... (I guess not!)
Klavier:
So the trap failed by chance... by mistake. Thanks to this commemorative stamp.
Judge:
Hmm. Quite the close call!

Vera:
...It was after that job that we moved to the current studio...
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You mean you moved to where the current "Drew Studio" is?
Vera:
...Yes... we saw very few people there... ...I began drawing picture books...
Klavier:
This single job had tied them to the criminal underworld. I'd think Mr. Misham wished to reduce their visibility in the world at large.
Vera:
...When we had to meet someone for some reason... ...Father posed as the creator of the work...
Apollo:
So that was the real essence of the artist, "Drew Misham". You did the work, and he supplied the face.

M-Magicians...?
Vera:

Trucy:
...Even though she fainted when she saw Mr. Hat.
Apollo:
You're confusing "mysterious" with "freaky".
Vera:
...Father took me when I was very young... ...It was a great magic show. I loved it so much...
Trucy:
See!? See!? Isn't magic great?
Apollo:
Fine, great, yeah, sure. No need to get all excited.
Vera:
...But the magic troupe we saw disbanded soon after... ...I was quite sad...
Apollo:
...... (Did she just say what I think she said? Magic "troupe"? Now where have I heard that before...?)
Present Magic Show Ticket
Apollo:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Those magicians you liked, was it this bunch!?"
Apollo:
(The red envelope came after she'd completed her first "job"... That makes it a letter from her client... whoever wanted a forgery made.)
Trucy:
Apollo...!
Apollo:
We're close. We just have to piece together the parts: A deadly weapon in a red envelope... ...and the path it took to take Drew Misham's life.
Apollo:
Those magicians you liked, was it this bunch!?
Vera:
......
Trucy:
Apollo! They're not a "bunch"!
Judge:
Hmm... I see! Still, I have to wonder. Why include a commemorative stamp like that in a business letter?
Apollo:
Good question!
Trucy:
Well, pretty stamps are always better, and you can't beat Troupe Gramarye!
Judge:
But, the whole murder plan was a failure because of it. Ironic, don't you think. ...Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
......
Judge:
...Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
...... Gram... Gram... Gramarye.
Apollo:
(What's with Gavin...?)
Klavier:
...Might I ask just one question of this witness?
Vera:
...?
Klavier:
In your testimony just now, you stated... ...this was your "first work that was other than a painting".
Vera:
......
Klavier:
Please, tell me... ...what exactly did you make?
Vera:
...... ...Can I ask why--
Klavier:
No! Answer the question! ...Now!
Vera:
Eeeeeeeeeek!
Judge:
P-Prosecutor Gavin...? You're usually not the one whose volume concerns me.
Klavier:
...Yes, it is unbecoming of me. I apologize. But... I must know. Please, Ms. Misham, tell me.
Vera:
...... ...It was... a book... ...A single page... In a "book"...
Klavier:
A "book"...? Please be more specific.
Vera:
...... ...It was a handwritten book. Like... Like a diary...
Klavier:
...... Nnnno! I don't... No!!!
Trucy:
Wh-What's wrong with Prosecutor Gavin? He looks like he just saw a ghost!
Klavier:
...Ms. Misham. This "book"... ...was there a picture of a silk hat on the back cover? Yes or no!?
Vera:
...! ...How... How did you know...?
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
...Prosecutor Gavin! The defendant is answering all of your questions! Stop badgering her!
Klavier:
...... He's told you nothing, has he? ...Your soiled, sullied mentor. Nothing!?
Apollo:
Sullied... who?
Klavier:
Phoenix Wright. Who else!?
Trucy:
...Daddy?
Klavier:
He never told you about the trial, seven years ago? About how he came to lose his attorney's badge...
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
It was a certain piece of evidence that decided his fate, you know. ...A certain diary. On the back, it bore the mark of a silk hat.
Apollo:
...Whaaaaaat!? (Phoenix Wright, tossed out of the profession by false evidence... And the forger who made that evidence... ...is this girl standing right in front of me!?) Vera! You must tell us! The evidence you made was used in a trial seven years ago. Who asked "Drew Misham", you, to forge that evidence!? ...For all of our sakes, who was it!?
Vera:
...... ...We... only met once...
Apollo:
You... You met the client!? Well, who was it!?
Vera:
...It was... ...It was... ......
Trucy:
What's going on with Vera? She's staring at Prosecutor Gavin's face again...
Klavier:
Yes, what? Is there something about me...?
Vera:
...... ...I remember clearly... ...I remember who gave me the book... the diary... ......

Who was it!?

...... Ugh...! *choke*...!

Ve... Vera!!!

Defendant Vera Misham -- condition: unconscious. Examiner's diagnosis: Acute atroquinine poisoning.
...This ends the recording of the trial for the murder of Drew Misham. Vera Misham was, during the trial, poisoned by an unknown assailant. The dosage was just under the lethal amount, sparing the defendant's life. She is currently in intensive care, and is not to be disturbed for any reason. ...A very simple case, at first glance... ...until it finally began to show its true colors. The long road to the truth takes us to the record of another trial. In some ways, that was the starting point of it all. And that is where we must go... ...to find the whole truth.
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Apollo:
...Um... You sure about that?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
(Ack! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Apollo:
They aren't, are they...?
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Justice, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Apollo:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Apollo:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
...You don't sound very sure, Mr. Justice. Objection overruled.
Apollo:

Perceive wrong area (during cross-examination segment "The Scent of a Story")
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Apollo:
Mr. Brushel! You're hiding something!
Brushel:
Yooooooooooooooooooowrk! Dontyellallofasuddenlikethat! You'll give a guy a heart attack...
Apollo:
Ack! Sorry! It's just... the way you were moving just now. It was particularly suspicious.
Brushel:
What's that supposed to mean!? So usually I'm just sort of "averagely" suspicious?
Apollo:
...Sorry. My mistake. You're fine. (I know I'm on to something here. Time to focus!)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Vera Misham...
Guilty
Judge:
The defendant will surrender herself to the court's care... ...to undergo a regular trial at the High Court within a month's time. Court is adjourned!
