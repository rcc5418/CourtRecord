Episode II
The Adventure of the Unbreakable Speckled Band
Anime cutscene
In a corner of that small, dark room, Sholmes and I waited with bated breath. In time, there came from the ventilator a hiss and a soft, almost growl-like sound. Suddenly, Sholmes sprang into action, lashing furiously with his cane at a point in the darkness. 'You see it, Wilson?' he yelled, his tense voice reverberating through the air. I raised my dark-lantern's shutter, and the room slowly came into view. Sholmes was staring intently at one particular corner when he started whispering to me, 'The victim's most perplexing final words - "the speckled band" - I believe this is the terrible coil to which she referred, Wilson!' In front of us was an enormous adder, its fangs bared as it threatened to strike. It truly was the most terrible 'speckled band' I had ever seen.
9th January, 6:37 a.m.
On Board the Steamship Burya
Anime cutscene
Detective:
So then...let us unravel this mystery and discover what events led to this curious murder. Pray, do excuse me. The cabin door was bolted from the inside when the man was killed. No marks to suggest the bolt was tampered with in any way. So this would appear to be a locked room mystery. In his final moments, the victim scrawled a message on the floor. Hm, almost certainly with the ink from this upset bottle. A Russian word... So the victim was a Russian man, then. And the letters are well formed, suggesting he was compos mentis at the time. Hm, this is a most extraordinary script. And evidently...not penned by the same hand as this message. In fact, I deduce it was written by someone of a different nationality. This paper seal was placed just prior to the incident... by the victim himself, I would venture. Well... what have we here?
Sailor 1:
Who are you and WHAT do you think you are doing here?!
Sailor 2:
Da, da! No one must touch before maritime police come! We must wait!
Detective:
Shh! That won't be necessary. You see...in less than five seconds from now, I will reveal the killer to you. 
Sailor 1:
D-Don't be absurd! This is murder! And in cabin locked from inside!
Detective:
Ah yes, the locked room. But that mystery is paper thin. 
Susato:
You, you don't mean...the culprit is in there?!
Sailor 3:
Wh-Who are you and where have you come from?
Detective:
I'm a Great British consulting detective. The only one in the world. Herlock Sholmes. I presume...you must have heard of me.
(Ugh, my head is throbbing. What's going on? Something's not right here. There's trouble in the air...)
Examine evidence
University Collar Pin
Front of pin
Ryunosuke:
Ah, the symbol of Yumei University... Every student wears this pin with pride. It's funny, but most emblems seem to be either round or rectangular. I like this spiked design, even though it doesn't really make any sense. Although, it does cause problems. Lots of students end up cutting their fingers on their badges. Perhaps it was the idea of one of the founders. 'A sharp pin for a sharp mind' or something...?
Back of pin
Ryunosuke:
My personal student number is engraved on the back here. If you lose your pin, they won't accept you as a Yumei student at the university. 'Yu mei not come in!' they say. Of course, you can get a new pin made if you can just tell them your number. I've actually lost mine twice already, but I still don't know my student number by heart. I always say to myself, 'I mustn't forget to write it down somewhere.' But then I forget not to forget that...
Paper Seal
Front of seal
Ryunosuke:
This is the paper seal I wrote for the wardrobe. I remember really working hard to make it. But I'll never forget how Kazuma reacted. 'Do you expect the Russian crew to be able to read that?!' he said. Still, I was sure people would get the idea, even if they couldn't read it. So we used it anyway. And it worked. I don't know if the crew thought it was creepy or what, but no one opened the doors!
Glue on backside
Ryunosuke:
You can see the remnants of the glue we used to stick this over the wardrobe doors. Although it wasn't proper glue, of course. We didn't have any of that with us. So I pulverised some rice into a paste to use instead. But to a stowaway like me, every single grain of rice represents precious rations. That's why I spread it as thinly as I possibly could. I couldn't bear to waste any.
Ryunosuke:
(Wait... I, I can't move!) Agh! What the- (Why am I in handcuffs?!)
???:
Hmph. So, you wake up now, hm? 
Sailor:
We had to drag you out of the wardrobe. I do not believe how you could not wake up. You are true cold-blooded man. 
Ryunosuke:
You... Haah... You found me, then.
Sailor:
Da. We found you. And now you pay...kriminal! How long are you hiding in that tiny wardrobe, hm?
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... Sorry... 
Sailor:
Now you have been found, it is time to admit your crimes. Unless you want to find out how cold the ocean is, hm?
Ryunosuke:
No no! I'll tell you everything!
???:
There's only one thing I'd like to know from you.
Ryunosuke:
...! (Isn't that...?)
Susato:
Why did you do it? Why did you take his life?
Ryunosuke:
M-Miss Susato! ......... Wait, what did you just say? 'Take...his life'...? 
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Um... Where, where is he? Where's Kazuma?
Susato:
.........
Sailor:
Hah! You pretend you do not know?! You are a wolf in the sheep's pelt! You are the killer! Do not try to make excuses!
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
Susato:
Kazuma-sama was... Kazuma-sama's body was discovered not long ago. Here...in this very cabin. That was bolted shut from the inside.
Ryunosuke:
His, his body...?
Sailor:
Please... ...do not try to tell us you were doing this terrible thing in your sleep!
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma's dead...? But...he can't be... ......... And these handcuffs... Surely you don't think I...?
Susato:
I have to know... Why did you take Kazuma-sama's life? Answer me! Please!
No... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Kazuma... It was just two short weeks ago...
Ryunosuke:
Are you sure about this? Won't we get in trouble?
Kazuma:
Ha ha ha ha hah! Don't you find it fun being a stowaway? Besides, how else could you come to England with me to study?
Ryunosuke:
It was really something else when they brought your luggage in here earlier, though. The way that Russian crewman just tossed your travelling case onto the floor... ...I thought I was going to die!
Kazuma:
Yes, I still can't quite believe that. I really didn't think you'd be able to fit inside my trunk. You must be even less of a man than you look!
Ryunosuke:
Hey! Honestly, I thought I'd broken every bone in my body!
Kazuma:
Well, it's about fifty days until we dock in Great Britain. But if you confine yourself to my cabin here, I don't expect anyone will discover you.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh, I hope not! I get the feeling those Russians wouldn't be very forgiving of a stowaway...
Kazuma:
They're a sturdy bunch, that's for sure.
Ryunosuke:
What I want to know is, why do we need to keep it a secret from the young lady?
Kazuma:
From our faithful Judicial Assistant Mikotoba, you mean?
Ryunosuke:
From YOUR close friend, more to the point. Surely we could confide in her, couldn't we? I don't believe she'd give me away.
Kazuma:
No, but if she knew what we'd done, that would make her guilty by association. It's best that only you and I know about this.
Ryunosuke:
Hm, I suppose so... 
Kazuma:
Anyway, it's about the time that the steward is supposed to come and clean the cabin. I know it's cramped, but you'd better get in there, I think. It won't be for long. And anyway, compared to hiding inside my travelling case, it'll be a breeze. 
Ryunosuke:
Yes, but what if the steward decides to open the wardrobe for some reason? Then I'll be in for it.
Kazuma:
Stop worrying. I tell you what. Why don't you write 'Keep out' or something on this piece of paper?
Ryunosuke:
What?
Kazuma:
Then I can stick it over the wardrobe doors once you're inside.
Ryunosuke:
I don't know...
We've only been at sea for about fifteen days. How can this have happened? We were supposed to be going on this adventure to England together!
Sailor:
We leave you at next port. Stay quiet until then. Don't make more trouble for yourself... ...Murderer!
Ryunosuke:
No! I'm not a murderer!
Sailor:
Da! You said before! You said you admit everything about your crimes!
Ryunosuke:
No! That's not right! I mean, yes, I did stow away on this ship, but... Murdering my best friend?
Sailor:
No one else could have done it. Admit the truth!
Ryunosuke:
Um...Susato-san...
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Please...tell me what happened! I need to know!
Susato:
......... Very well. But there is something I would like to ask of you, too.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, those eyes... She looks like she's ready to destroy me... This nightmare is getting worse by the minute... I suppose all I can do is try to find out what really happened...)
Converse
Kazuma's death
Ryunosuke:
He, he really has been killed, hasn't he? This isn't just a bad dream?
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
And these handcuffs... They think I did it? They think I'm Kazuma's killer?
Susato:
When they found him, the cabin was locked from the inside.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Susato:
There's no access to the cabin via a porthole window, and the bolt on the door can't be operated from the outside. In other words, after the...crime, the culprit couldn't have escaped these four walls.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Susato:
Or to put it another way, the culprit can only have been somebody inside this cabin. ...Or do you have some other explanation?
Ryunosuke:
......... (This is impossible...) How did he die, then? What happened exactly?
Susato:
Are you still going to deny the charge? Even despite the circumstances?
Ryunosuke:
Please, Susato-san! You have to tell me!
Susato:
......... The cause of death is...still undetermined. 
Ryunosuke:
(They don't know how he died?)
Susato:
The ship's doctor is examining the body, but of course, he has no post-mortem analysis experience. I don't suppose we shall learn more until an expert has been consulted at our next port of call.
Ryunosuke:
So presumably that means...there were no obvious external signs of injury, then?
Susato:
That's true, yes.
About the incident
Ryunosuke:
Can't anyone tell me what exactly happened here in this cabin?! I don't understand it! Why would anyone want to kill Kazuma?
Susato:
Presumably, that's something you know the answer to better than anyone.
Ryunosuke:
Please...
Susato:
Whatever you say, you were here in the cabin, after all.
Ryunosuke:
Well, yes, I was, but...
Susato:
......... He would always wake before dawn and do his training first thing in the morning. I was waiting outside his cabin, as I have every day so far on this voyage. But this morning, he did not come. I could sense that he wouldn't.
Ryunosuke:
(Does that mean...he was already dead when Susato-san arrived at his cabin door, I wonder.)
Susato:
I knocked, but there was no reply. Then I started to become worried, so I went to find a member of the crew. The crewman forced the cabin door open, and when we managed to get inside... ...there was Kazuma-sama, collapsed on the floor... .........
Ryunosuke:
(And the white tape there now shows exactly where he was found, I suppose...) I had no idea anything had happened. I, I must have been asleep in the wardrobe somehow...
Susato:
I wish it wasn't the case, but...that's just very hard to believe.
Ryunosuke:
(This is all very hard to believe for me, too. Trust me!)
After clearing all Converse options:
Susato:
Now I've told you everything that I know. So it's my turn to ask you a question.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, alright. (Ugh, my head feels so heavy. It's still throbbing like anything.)
Converse
'Stowaway'
Susato:
Why are you even on board this ship, Naruhodo-san? You said something before about being a stowaway, didn't you?
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes... I'm afraid that's true. It's two weeks since we left Japan now. And I've been shut up in this cabin the entire time.
Susato:
I had no idea. But how could you have occupied Kazuma-sama's cabin for so long without him noticing?
Ryunosuke:
No no no! That would have been impossible, obviously!
Susato:
......... Yes, of course.
Ryunosuke:
...Kazuma invited me. He wanted us to go to England together.
Susato:
He actually asked you? But...why?
Ryunosuke:
I'm afraid...I don't really know the reason myself.
Susato:
I don't understand...
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma, why do you want this? What's the real reason? Why go to such extreme lengths to smuggle me to England with you?
Kazuma:
......... It's an idea that's been on my mind ever since the end of that incredible trial. I think I told you then, didn't I? That you ought to become a lawyer yourself.
Ryunosuke:
Well, yes, you did say that. But I didn't think you were serious. 
Kazuma:
You have a talent for it. I can assure you of that.
Ryunosuke:
But I've never really thought about becoming a lawyer.
Kazuma:
Well, that's something you can decide for yourself. London is at the spearhead of cultural development. The centre of the world, in many ways. There can't be any harm in seeing such an important place with your own eyes, can there?
Ryunosuke:
Well, no, definitely not.
Kazuma:
But on a personal level... ...if you were to become a lawyer, then... .........
Ryunosuke:
Then what?
Kazuma:
Nothing. Forget it.
Ryunosuke:
...?
Susato:
......... Kazuma-sama is- He was always saying the same thing. That he wanted to change the Japanese legal system. Perhaps he thought he could do that with you.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, maybe. (But something's still bothering me a little. The look in his eyes then... It was darker than I've ever seen it before.) Um, Susato-san... I'm sorry that we kept it a secret from you. My stowing away on this ship, I mean.
Susato:
If I know Kazuma-sama... ...I expect he was trying to protect me. To avoid me becoming guilty by association.
Ryunosuke:
That's, that's exactly right, yes. (Word perfect, in fact!)
Last night
Susato:
If you're not the culprit, then tell me... What happened last night here in this cabin?
Ryunosuke:
......... Well, the thing is... ...I don't really remember. 
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma brought me something to eat, just like he always did. And then I got myself into that wardrobe over there, just like I always did. After that, I...
Susato:
Fell asleep?
Ryunosuke:
Erm... Well, yes.
Susato:
So deeply that you didn't even stir when Kazuma-sama was killed?
Ryunosuke:
Erm... Well...yes.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
I know it sounds unbelievable. Really, I do. But it's the truth! If only I'd woken up, then perhaps I wouldn't be in this predicament. And for some reason...my head's still throbbing like anything.
Susato:
Really? .........
Ryunosuke:
Erm, is something wrong?
Susato:
Oh, um... No, it's... Please, forget it.
Ryunosuke:
Susato-san! You have to believe me! I didn't do it!
Susato:
I, I really don't want to doubt you. But the trouble is...there is no one else who could possibly have done this.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
After clearing all Converse options:
Ryunosuke:
(Kazuma... I don't understand. Why...? Why did this have to happen?!) Argh! (I can't take this!)
Susato:
Don't try to go anywhere! You're the perpetrator of this crime. You can't leave, I can't allow that to happen.
Ryunosuke:
...I'm sorry. But Kazuma was killed right under my nose here. And...I didn't do anything to stop it! And now I'm supposed to just sit around, my hands tied, while whoever did this walks free? No! I can't allow that to happen!
Susato:
Well, what do you propose to do, then?
Ryunosuke:
I'm going to investigate. I'm going to find out exactly what happened here! I'm going to work out who took Kazuma's life, and how and why they did it! So I'm sorry...but you're going to have to excuse me!
Susato:
Haiiiiiii-YA!
Ryunosuke:
What the-
Susato:
That was a Susato Takedown.
Ryunosuke:
A Su-Susato what? (What martial art form is that?)
Susato:
I'm going to need you to prove it.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? Prove 'it'?
Susato:
Yes, Your innocence. I need evidence.
Ryunosuke:
But, but how am I supposed to...?
Susato:
Have you forgotten already? What you achieved just a few weeks ago. You successfully defended yourself in a court of law.
Ryunosuke:
Ah... (I see... She's expecting me to present some conclusive evidence.)
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(I have to get Susato-san to believe me! I'll show her some evidence right now that proves I'm not guilty of this awful crime!)
Present Paper Seal
Ryunosuke:
 
Leads to:
"Tell me, when I was discovered in the wardrobe before..."
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
 
Ryunosuke:
Alright then, how about this?
Susato:
You can't trick me with something irrelevant like that.
Ryunosuke:
Oh... (I'd better try to come up with something more convincing. Otherwise I get the feeling she'll throw me on the floor all over again.)
Susato:
The way you're looking at me... ...I think perhaps I didn't throw you hard enough.
Ryunosuke:
No no! It was definitely hard enough! Let me show you something else...
Leads back to:
"I have to get Susato-san to believe me!"
Ryunosuke:
Tell me, when I was discovered in the wardrobe before... ...was this piece of paper stuck over the doors?
Susato:
Oh, yes, it was. I remember clearly.
Ryunosuke:
I thought so. Kazuma always put it in place whenever I went to sleep in there. Just in case the cabin steward or another crew member decided to look inside. So naturally, he did the same last night as well.
Susato:
Ah! Yes, of course! The gentleman who discovered you peeled that sign from the wardrobe doors...before he opened them.
Ryunosuke:
But if I were truly the culprit... ...I couldn't have climbed back inside the wardrobe and stuck this on the outside of the doors on my own.
Susato:
Yes... That's quite true.
Ryunosuke:
In other words... ...it's impossible that I killed Kazuma!
Susato:
......... ......... Well... Even if you are sprawled hopelessly on the floor... ...I can see why Kazuma-sama thought so highly of you.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you...Susato-san. Now, do you think perhaps you could help me up?
Susato:
Well, in the light of that evidence... ...I don't see any reason why I should stop you from investigating in here at least.
Examine evidence
Paper Seal
Front of seal
Susato:
You drew the characters for this paper seal, didn't you, Naruhodo-san? They're such bold, vivid strokes you made!
Ryunosuke:
You're looking at a man who came aboard inside a trunk. Those brushstrokes needed to make a statement. If they'd found me in that wardrobe, those Russians would have hurled me into the freezing cold ocean.
Susato:
...I'm sure none of the crewmen would have done anything like that.
Ryunosuke:
Hm... Well, I'm not so sure.
Susato:
They would have forced you to wash dishes in the galley until you were on death's door or something like that.
Ryunosuke:
Wash dishes until I was on death's door? That's a lot of dishes.
Glue on backside
Susato:
Ah, these must be remnants of the glue you used to stick the paper seal on the wardrobe.
Ryunosuke:
That's right. It was pulverised rice.
Susato:
...Pulverised rice?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. I pulverised some of the rice from my evening meal...even though it broke my heart.
Susato:
Broke your heart?! What do you mean?
Ryunosuke:
Remember, I'm a stowaway on this ship. All I had to eat were Kazuma's leftovers. Even a couple of grains of rice could have meant the difference between life and death!
Susato:
Oh my... It must have been awful for you, Naruhodo-san. But I have some glue with me, as it happens. You're welcome to use it this evening.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Thank you very much!
Ryunosuke:
Thank you! So you finally believe me?
Susato:
I'm sorry... No.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Susato:
I'm not sure yet. I can't rule out the possibility that you used some sort of conjuring trick to put the sign back in position.
Ryunosuke:
(What does she think I am, a magician?)
Susato:
For now, I suggest you investigate as thoroughly as possible in here. I'll do the same.
Ryunosuke:
Alright! Let's get to work, Susato-san!
Susato:
Please don't misunderstand me. I still have my doubts.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Susato:
I shall be watching you, to make sure you do nothing that might disturb the crime scene. I wouldn't want you using your conjuring tricks to destroy evidence, for example.
Ryunosuke:
R-Right... (Well anyway, I should make a start on investigating in here. Examine everything I can. Kazuma, I swear... I will avenge your death!)
Examine
Sailor in corner
Ryunosuke:
(Perhaps I should see what this Russian crewman makes of the scene of the crime.) Um, excuse me...
Sailor:
What?
Ryunosuke:
I, I was wondering how it's going. The investigation, I mean.
Sailor:
......... Grandmother told me Japanese people do not make jokes, but is not true, I see.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sailor:
The kriminal asking investigator for information about his crime? Very funny.
Ryunosuke:
Oh... It wasn't supposed to be a joke.
Susato:
He doesn't appear to be laughing, either. He's convinced you're guilty.
Ryunosuke:
(He might have useful information, though. I have to keep trying...) So, last night... Did you notice anything out of the ordinary at all?
Sailor:
......... Nyet! Of course not! Now back to corner of room and make silent! ...I say no more to you.
Ryunosuke:
(Hm, did I hit a nerve? Just for a moment there, he seemed a little flustered.)
Door
Susato:
When I went for help and the crewmen forced the door open... ...this bolt had been firmly closed.
Ryunosuke:
Hm, it's quite a small bolt, and not particularly sturdy. And it just slides across to secure the door shut. But still, with the door bolted, there would be no way to get in or out of the cabin, that's for sure. (It's no wonder everyone suspects me.)
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(When she glares at me like that, I feel tense all up and down my spine.) I, I remember reading once in a detective novel... The culprit used a needle and thread to draw a bolt across from outside the room in a situation like this!
Susato:
Yes, that's a clever trick, isn't it? I'm an avid reader of detective stories myself. But the door of this cabin and its frame are made of metal, and they seal together perfectly. There would be no possibility of using that needle and thread trick here, I'm afraid. .........
Ryunosuke:
(When she glares at me like that, I feel pins and needles all up and down my spine...)
Sign
Ryunosuke:
These are the 'Rules of Passage' for travel aboard the SS Burya.
Susato:
It's essentially a list of requests from the captain to all passengers on board.
Ryunosuke:
'Passengers must not keep weapons or other dangerous objects in their cabins. Pets are also strictly forbidden.'
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
What? Why are you staring at me?
Susato:
Oh...sorry. I was just thinking. Are you more of a dangerous object or a pet? I can't decide.
Ryunosuke:
(Well, one thing's for sure. Either way, I wasn't supposed to be in here.)
Shelf
Ryunosuke:
The books have fallen over on the shelf, look. They've all toppled the same way.
Susato:
And what's this? A statue of some god of the sea? Although he's fallen over as well.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it's almost as if the whole shelf has been ransacked, and everything mown down at once.
Susato:
I wonder if... Perhaps it was Kazuma-sama doing his morning sword training, do you think?
Ryunosuke:
I...seriously doubt it.
Susato:
Then perhaps... ...it was you, Naruhodo-san? In a fit of rage.
Ryunosuke:
I wouldn't have bothered leaving the wardrobe just to mess up a few books and a statue. (Could the way these things have been thrown about have anything to do with the case, I wonder...)
Susato:
Well, I'll just set everything straight again. I don't like to see a mess.
Scroll
Ryunosuke:
'Seigi'... The Japanese word for 'justice'. The brush strokes are straight and true, just like Kazuma.
Susato:
Yes, his calligraphy always was a reflection of his heart. Yet, you... Can you really look at those characters without feeling shame, knowing who drew them so thoughtfully?
Ryunosuke:
Of course I can! I mean, I'm innocent, so...why shouldn't I be able to?
Susato:
......... Even though you stowed away on this ship?
Ryunosuke:
......... Now you're going to bring that up, are you? I can't win...
Katana
Susato:
That's Kazuma-sama's precious sword. He never went anywhere without it.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, he was always saying, that a Japanese man's katana is his soul.
Susato:
I believe he had to work very hard to convince the government to allow him to bring it on this trip.
Ryunosuke:
I suppose that shows just how important it was to him. (And now he's gone... But I'm not ready to let his spirit go just yet.)
Susato:
.........
Chicken dinner or knife
Ryunosuke:
That's my dinner from last night. A roast chicken. It was really tasty.
Susato:
Yes, it was very delicious, wasn't it? But...did you eat it on the floor here?
Ryunosuke:
I'm not a dog, Susato-san. I ate at the table, of course. (Which begs the question of when and how the plate ended up on the floor.)
Susato:
But Kazuma-sama didn't like chicken at all, did he?
Ryunosuke:
No, that's right. So he didn't touch it. Which meant all the more for me!
Susato:
Oh no! Does, does that mean...? Poor Kazuma-sama spent his last night on this earth with an empty belly? It's just too horrible...
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, now I suddenly have a guilty conscience and an achy stomach.)
Table
Susato:
There's nothing on this table at all. The plate and cutlery are all over the floor for some reason.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it's strange. Last night when I went to sleep, I'm sure everything was still... No, wait a minute.
Susato:
What is it?
Ryunosuke:
That's funny. I, I can't seem to remember anything about what happened after dinner at all.
Susato:
......... So, so then perhaps...you ARE responsible for what happened to Kazuma-sama!
Ryunosuke:
No no no!
Suitcase
Susato:
That's a very large travelling case, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It carries...a lot of memories for me.
Susato:
Memories? What do you mean?
Ryunosuke:
Well, that's actually how I stowed away on this vessel. I was brought on board inside that case. 
Susato:
Ah yes, I see it says 'this way up'...in Japanese.
Ryunosuke:
Which in hindsight, I should have realised the foreign crewmen wouldn't be able to read. I was turned over and over and over. And then I was tossed on the floor in here.
Susato:
Oh dear. Being a stowaway isn't as romantic as it sounds.
Ryunosuke:
(Well, it was less painful than a Susato Takedown...)
Broken glass or floor mark
Ryunosuke:
What do you think this is? It looks like a broken piece of glassware. (Whatever the thing was, it appears to have broken clean in two...)
Susato:
The glass is such a beautiful colour. It looks like a cute little netsuke fastener form a kimono outfit.
Ryunosuke:
(I'm not sure that sounds like Kazuma. He wouldn't have secretly carried a cute little trinket like this around with him...would he?)
Susato:
And the mark beside it... What is it, I wonder? It has a sort of brick-like hue.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, you're right. It is the colour of brick, isn't it? (Even though I don't see anything of the same colour anywhere else in the cabin...)
Writing on floor or body outline
Ryunosuke:
Did, did Kazuma write that before he died? It looks like it's written in ink.
Susato:
He must have knocked the ink pot from the desk when he collapsed on the floor. Then I suppose he wrote this message by dipping his finger in the spillage. Poor Kazuma-sama... No doubt he was in terrible pain... It's almost unbearable to imagine it.
Ryunosuke:
(I suppose he was trying to leave some kind of a clue in his final moments, was he?) I'm sorry, partner... But I can't read your writing.
Susato:
I don't think that's Japanese, Naruhodo-san.
Ryunosuke:
What?! Then, then what language is it?
Susato:
It pains me to admit it, but...I don't know.
Ryunosuke:
(It's not a foreign script I'm familiar with. What does it mean, I wonder?)
Desk
Susato:
This is where dear Kazuma-sama would have sat whenever he was writing.
Ryunosuke:
'London Diary'... (Poor Kazuma. He didn't even make it to his destination...)
Susato:
It looks as though the last entry is incomplete.
Ryunosuke:
(Which means...what? He was in the middle of writing it when the incident happened?) Let's see what it says. It could be a valuable clue!
Susato:
Haiiiiiii-YA! That's out of the question! 
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
Susato:
Kazuma-sama may have departed this world... but you must NOT read his private thoughts!
Ryunosuke:
But, but what if it's something important? Something relevant to the case?
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Alright, alright. I won't read it.
Susato:
Poor Kazuma-sama...
Ryunosuke:
(I don't like prying into people's personal matters, either. But in this case, isn't the need for clues more important?)
Susato:
.........
Wardrobe
Susato:
It's some two weeks since we set sail from Japan. Have you really been living in that wardrobe the entire time, Naruhodo-san?
Ryunosuke:
I think 'living'...isn't quite the right description.
Susato:
Oh, no, I suppose not. Although it must have been rather exciting, making this voyage in your own secret hideout.
Ryunosuke:
The trouble was, I never knew when a member of the crew might come in. So yes, I did basically have to 'live' in the wardrobe. And last night was no exception.
Susato:
But because of that, you had no idea what was happening out here in the cabin.
Ryunosuke:
......... No... Sadly not.
Susato:
.........
Bell cord
Susato:
This is... Yes, it's a bell cord contraption, I think.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean, 'contraption'?
Susato:
I read about it in a book I was studying that talked about life in Great Britain. Large households often have bell cords like this, which you can pull to ring a bell to summon servants.
Ryunosuke:
Really? That sounds almost magical.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
......... Shall we give it a little try?
Susato:
Yes! ...In the interests of cultural research, obviously. 
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
......... I suppose nobody comes for lowly Japanese people...
Ryunosuke:
No no, I'm sure it's just that everyone is busy, that's all.
Vent
Susato:
I think that's some kind of opening for a ventilator. A hole through which fresh air can circulate into the cabin.
Ryunosuke:
Isn't that a little odd?
Susato:
What do you mean?
Ryunosuke:
Well, this ventilator, if that's what it is... ...looks like it must connect to the next-door cabin.
Susato:
Yes, it would appear to. You're right.
Ryunosuke:
But if its purpose is to allow fresh air into the room, surely it should be connected to the outside.
Susato:
Hm, that's true... Perhaps it's so that rain and spray don't find their way in when the seas are rough. Or something like that?
Ryunosuke:
I suppose... Maybe that's it.
After examining one area:
Susato:
Oh dear, that won't do.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! What's the matter, Susato-san?
Susato:
I don't suppose you're as foolish as me in that regard, are you, Naruhodo-san? I'm sure you're careful to look all around using [D-pad / B M], aren't you? Now, let's investigate all corners of this cabin!
Ryunosuke:
Yes! Let's do that! (I suppose my field of vision has been rather small until now...)
Shelf (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
These books are provided for the entertainment of whoever is occupying the cabin, I suppose.
Susato:
And they must be well looked after. You mustn't damage any of the ship's property!
Ryunosuke:
But it wasn't me who knocked them over...
Susato:
Well anyway, I feel much better now they're neatly lined up. I can't relax when things are in a mess.

Any option
Ryunosuke:
There's just one thing, Susato-san...
Susato:
Yes?
Ryunosuke:
Before we get on with investigating the cabin, could I ask you again abo-
Susato:
Haiiiiiii-YA!
I'm sorry. But I've already told you everything I know. We must do our best to find clues now. There's no time to lose!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, alright. Could you just help me up first, please?
Move
Ryunosuke:
(I'm in handcuffs and under house arrest by the crew, not to mention Susato-san's constant glares... I think it's fair to say that I'm stuck in this cabin, for the time being at least. I should focus on investigating in here to see what I can find out.)
Present
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Um, Susato-san, about this...
Susato:
I'm sorry, Naruhodo-san... ...but we don't have time to waste on anything else. We must find clues.
Ryunosuke:
(Hm, she looks serious. Really quite deadly serious!)
After examining desk, vent, and writing on floor/body outline:
Ryunosuke:
(Who's that? He wasn't there a minute ago... As far as I can tell, it looks like he might be European...)
Susato:
Oh! How did he...?
Ryunosuke:
You've noticed the man, too, have you? I've no idea who he is, or how he got in here. But he looks suspicious. And tall. Suspiciously tall!
Susato:
...! Naruhodo-san, don't tell me... Do you really not know who that is?
Ryunosuke:
Um, well...no. I don't have any foreign friends or acquaintances at all. (He doesn't look like a member of the crew. There's something very...unusual about him. And is he investigating Kazuma's desk, or is he just playing on it? I can't tell.)
Susato:
Well! In that case...we simply must talk with him!
Ryunosuke:
(Am I imagining it, or does Susato-san look almost uncontrollably excited?)
Susato:
By the way, I expect that you've noticed already, but just in case... If you press [A / Space] on people when they're in the cross hairs, you can converse with them.
Ryunosuke:
Alright then, I'll get that suspiciously tall gentleman in my sights and see what he has to say for himself!
Susato:
Oh, please do!

Excuse me! Do you have a moment?

Shh! This is a critical point in my investigation. .........
Ryunosuke:
Maybe I should leave him alone. He seems a little unfriendly.
Susato:
Yes, perhaps that would be for the best.
???:
Greetings! I hope I haven't kept you long?
Susato:
Agh!
Ryunosuke:
Um, what exactly were you doing on Kazuma's desk just now?
???:
......... ...Ah, I see. Fascinating.
Ryunosuke:
Uh...sorry? What do you see? (It feels like he's looking right through me!)
???:
Oh yes. Everything is clear now. The train of reasoning has run its course. My deductions have crystalised. You... ...have been in Afghanistan, I perceive. Just recently returned, if I'm not mistaken.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? ...WHAT?!
???:
And now, whilst venturing toward foreign climes, you find yourself in a most troubling predicament.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! (Well, that's true at least.)
Susato:
But, but how...?
???:
'How the deuce did I know that?' perhaps? It was really a most elementary deduction. Hardly worth explaining.
Susato:
Have you perhaps...managed to deduce anything else?
???:
But of course. A great many things. There is no mystery, my dear madam. For example... ...you have fled your native land of Russia, being, as you are, a merciless revolutionary!
Ryunosuke:
...!
???:
You leave sixteen victims of assassination in your wake, and now travel to England to blow up the Crystal Tower!
Ryunosuke:
...!!
???:
And! When the beribboned occupant of this very cabin discovered your identity, you ended his life, too! Yes...I believe that summarises the facts beautifully. No need to hide the truth now. Nothing deceives these eyes.
Ryunosuke:
......... Erm, just to be clear... You are talking about me, are you?
???:
Certainly I am. Do you see another in this cabin who fits the bill? A Russian assassin with sixteen victims to his name?
Ryunosuke:
(I don't even see ONE person who fits the bill!)
Susato:
......... So it's true. It was you who did this to Kazuma-sama.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Susato:
And, and you're plotting a revolution, too... It's shameful behavior, Naruhodo-san. Absolutely wicked!
Ryunosuke:
No...listen, there's no way I-
Susato:
Haiiiiiii-YA! Now explain yourself! Tell me everything!
Ryunosuke:
(This is ridiculous!)
Susato:
How could you do it?
Ryunosuke:
For pity's sake, open your eyes! I'm not a Russian revolutionary! Obviously!
Susato:
Oh... Forgive me...
Ryunosuke:
And as for you! What kind of deduction was that?! You were just saying the first thing that came into your head!
???:
Ah, but was I not right? Whilst venturing toward foreign climes, you do find yourself in a most troubling predicament...do you not?
Ryunosuke:
Well, yes, maybe.
???:
Hah! There you have it, you see! What do you make of that? Hm?
Ryunosuke:
Well, to be honest... ...this ship is en route to England, and I'm in handcuffs at the scene of a murder. So...I'm not really sure you could call it 'deduction'. It's more plain 'observation'.
???:
Indeed! And observation, my dear boy, is the basis of all deduction. My method is founded upon the observation of trifles, you see. I announce my findings with a brassy certitude... ...and more often than not, I'm right!
Ryunosuke:
Haah... I don't think you introduced yourself.
???:
Ah, my apologies. How remiss of me. I am none other than the greatest detective of the century, known to men and women the world over.

We must ask him what he's deduced! He will have worked out the entire case already, I'm sure!

Oh yes, Randst Magazine! Full of wonderful short stories and interest articles from Great Britain! I never miss an issue! I have it sent from England especially!

Ah, yes, here it is... 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'... So...you're the protagonist in a series of short stories, then?

Indeed I am.

Backward?

My trusty biographer records my greatest detecting achievements and chronicles them in the magazine.

Sholmes:
Deduction, you see, is to me a science. Logical reasoning in its purest form.
Susato:
A science...?
Ryunosuke:
Really...?
Sholmes:
The astute observer notices even the most subtle of reactions in his subject. A furtive glance, a twitch of a muscle...a slight inclination of the posture... Fingernails, arm sleeves, furrows in the skin... All these things are data!
Ryunosuke:
Riiight...
Sholmes:
And the trained logician makes deductions from this data in the blink of an eye. The ultimate conclusion is, without fail...the truth! ...As I demonstrated only a few short moments ago.

Sholmes:
Have I managed to deduce anything? My dear fellow! Who do you suppose discovered the culprit in his most cunning hiding place? ...That's right! It was none other than the great detective before you now! Mr Herlock Sholmes!
Ryunosuke:
Ah, I see. (In other words... ...I'm in these now because of him.) 
Susato:
When I became anxious about Kazuma-sama this morning... ...I summoned all of the crew members to force the cabin door open.

And I concealed myself among their number, gaining entry to the scene of the crime. Yes! Luckily for everyone, the great detective, Herlock Sholmes, was on board! ...And the handcuffs seem to be an excellent fit, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
(Argh!)
Sholmes:
The very moment I laid eyes on the scene, two facts were immediately apparent to me.

Oh really? Two facts, you say?

Two facts
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes, tell us, please! What two facts were apparent to you when you came into this cabin this morning?
Sholmes:
Ah, yes... But first, let us be precise. The two facts in question were immediately apparent to me.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, yes, I understand. But what were they?
Sholmes:
Allow me to elucidate... The two facts that I deduced from a mere momentary glance at the scene of the crime were as follows: Number one: The cabin was locked from within, rendering escape of the culprit out of the question. Number two: The victim was Russian and killed following a dispute with an acquaintance.
Ryunosuke:
Hold on, Mr Sholmes! What made you think the victim was Russian?
Sholmes:
Observe the dying message left by the victim on the floor. 'ГАРДЕРОБ'... That is the Russian word for 'wardrobe'.
Susato:
Do, do you really think Kazuma-sama could have left a dying message in Russian?
Sholmes:
In their final moments, many find their native tongue filling their head. For this young man, Russian.
Ryunosuke:
(Kazuma...was Russian, was he...?)
Sholmes:
Initially, I considered 'Garderob' may be the name of the killer. A certain 'Robert Garde' perhaps... But in the interests of thoroughness, I decided it would be wrong not to look inside the wardrobe there at least.
Susato:
Where you found Mr Naruhodo sleeping soundly...
Sholmes:
Quite so! I found you! The renowned Russian revolutionary killer!
Ryunosuke:
(Why is that I'M Russian too?)
Sholmes:
I observed that you were wearing the same attire as the victim. In other words, you were acquainted. And if my memory serves, that outfit is the traditional dress of the Russian people.
Susato:
Our school uniforms are the traditional dress of the Russian people? I, I had no idea!
Ryunosuke:
...And I had no idea a detective could get something so wrong...
Sholmes:
I took a photograph of the victim and the message, that I might analyse it for possible hidden details.
Ryunosuke:
This...
Sholmes:
This was taken immediately after the young man was discovered, before the body was removed.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, Kazuma had already been taken away when I woke up. This is the first time I've actually seen him like this...)
Susato:
Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, um... Yes...thank you.
The photograph of the crime scene has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
Can I ask you something, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
What, pray?
Ryunosuke:
You mentioned Russia before as well, didn't you? You know, when you said I was a fearsome revolutionary fleeing from Russia and all that.
Sholmes:
Ah yes, the train of reasoning that led me to the truth.
Ryunosuke:
Would you mind explaining that train of reasoning to me, do you think?

Your deduction just now (appears after "Kazuma's death")
Ryunosuke:
Erm, can we talk about your deduction before? The things you concluded about me, I mean.
Sholmes:
Ah, the now famously accurate 'troubling predicament' you find yourself in?
Ryunosuke:
Actually, it was the other details that I was more hoping to discuss. You know, the 'merciless Russian revolutionary and assassin of sixteen' part?
Sholmes:
Ah yes, the more sordid details. It was a fairly commonplace deduction. Here we have this morning's paper. The main headline reads: 'Revolutionary Vilen Borshevik Flees Russia via Shanghai'. This vessel made a port call at Shanghai yesterday. And last night, the young Russian was murdered.
Ryunosuke:
(Since when was Kazuma a Russian?)
Susato:
It sounds like Mr Sholmes has concluded he was Russian because of what Kazuma-sama wrote on the floor.
Sholmes:
It was a simple act of reasoning to realise that the culprit of this crime was the same merciless revolutionary. One who would kill the very man who helped him to escape after his true identity was discovered! Yes, you...Vilen Borshevik!
Ryunosuke:
No no no! How could it be me? I don't look anything like this man! Just look at his face!
Sholmes:
Well...you are a fearsome revolutionary, after all. Therefore...you have no doubt learnt to revolutionise your appearance as well!
Ryunosuke:
Ugh, please...
Sholmes:
And, I might add, your name does not appear on the ship's passenger list. Need I say more?
Ryunosuke:
(Well, that's because I'm a stowaway...)
Susato:
What about the other details? The sixteen victims of assassination and blowing up the Crystal Tower?
Sholmes:
Ah yes. The journalist clearly interviewed the man and printed all those particulars in the article. The deeds the man has perpetrated thus far, and those he is plotting. Yes, everything about this revolutionary Borshevik was included. There can be no mistake.
Susato:
Do, do revolutionaries usually agree to interviews with newspaper reporters, I wonder...
Ryunosuke:
And what about the part where you said I was just returning from Afghanistan?
Sholmes:
Also quite clearly stated here in the article. Borshevik is recently returned after a period of subversive activities in a war-torn region of Afghanistan.
Ryunosuke:
(...Where even is it, anyway? This 'Afghanistan' place...)
Sholmes:
Here, take the paper for yourself. As a little memento of this great deduction.

Oh...um, thank you.

Before we started talking, you were examining Kazuma's desk, weren't you?
Sholmes:
Kazuma? ...Ah yes, the victim.
Susato:
Did you notice anything useful? Anything at all?
Sholmes:
Observe, for a moment, the desktop of the victim... We see that the victim was engaged in penning some text.
Ryunosuke:
'London Diary'... Kazuma was keeping notes of the trip. Ah, but... ...I don't think you should read his private writings. It could upset people.
Sholmes:
Tragic! And something you ought to perhaps elucidate BEFORE the act of reading.
Ryunosuke:
You, you mean you've read it already?
Sholmes:
It is my business to know what other people do not. Yes, believe it or not, I know a smattering of Japanese.

Oh, I see... (Well, you're about to know what a Susato Takedown is!)

Sholmes:
Anyway, to return to the matter at hand. Namely, this diary belonging to the victim... It would appear the final sentence is incomplete. As if the author were cut short. Tell me, what is the nature of the writing? Pray be precise as to details.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, but...I thought you knew Japanese?
Sholmes:
A smattering, dear boy, a smattering! 'Sayonara', 'bonsai', 'mikado', 'nado-nado'... I trust you're suitably impressed!
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Sholmes:
But this diary is littered with complicated-looking characters, of which I can read precisely none. Ah ha ha ha hah!
Ryunosuke:
(So what was all that showing off about before, then?)
Susato:
If you would be so kind as to show me, I would be happy to read it to you, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
I'm much obliged, my dear madam.
Susato:
The final entry here in Kazuma-sama's diary consists of just two short sentences. The first reads: '1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint whistling sound.'
Ryunosuke:
A whistling sound?
Sholmes:
Hm, these are very deep waters... Pray, go on...
Susato:
The second sentence reads: '1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.'
Ryunosuke:
A speckled band? What on earth does that mean?
Susato:
I have no idea. I've never heard that expression before.
Sholmes:
Hm, the ventilator grille, you say? The man was presumably referring... ...to the lattice there on the wall, which connects to the adjoining cabin.

You, you mean you've read it already?
Sholmes:
It is my business to know what other people do not. Yes, believe it or not, I know a smattering of Japanese.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see... (Well, you're about to know what a Susato Takedown is!)
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Susato-san? Aren't you going to throw the detective with one of your trademark takedowns?
Susato:
I'm sorry, Naruhodo-san. What on earth do you mean?
Ryunosuke:
(Life is so unfair...)
Sholmes:
Anyway, to return to the matter at hand. Namely, this diary belonging to the victim... It would appear the final sentence is incomplete. As if the author were cut short. Tell me, what is the nature of the writing? Pray be precise as to details.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, but...I thought you knew Japanese?
Sholmes:
A smattering, dear boy, a smattering! 'Sayonara', 'bonsai', 'mikado', 'nado-nado'... I trust you're suitably impressed!
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Sholmes:
But this diary is littered with complicated-looking characters, of which I can read precisely none. Ah ha ha ha hah!
Ryunosuke:
(So what was all that showing off about before, then?)
Susato:
If you would be so kind as to show me, I would be happy to read it to you, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
I'm much obliged, my dear madam.
Susato:
The final entry here in Kazuma-sama's diary consists of just two short sentences. The first reads: '1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint whistling sound.'
Ryunosuke:
A whistling sound?
Sholmes:
Hm, these are very deep waters... Pray, go on...
Susato:
The second sentence reads: '1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.'
Ryunosuke:
A speckled band? What on earth does that mean?
Susato:
I have no idea. I've never heard that expression before.
Sholmes:
Hm, the ventilator grille, you say? The man was presumably referring... ...to the lattice there on the wall, which connects to the adjoining cabin.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, the adjoining cabin...)
Move
Ryunosuke:
(I'm in handcuffs and under house arrest by the crew, not to mention Susato-san's constant glares... And now the great detective has deduced that I'm some kind of Russian revolutionary... My chances of getting out of this cabin are slim at best. At least for the time being, anyway. Perhaps I should see what the detective has to say for himself now...)
Present
Paper Seal
Sholmes:
Hm, I've never seen anything like this. Most extraordinary writing.
Susato:
You said the same earlier this morning, I think.
Sholmes:
Indeed. But its uncommonness is so remarkable, I felt the need to say it anew. Yes, I do believe... ...these characters may be a crude attempt at a Japanese script.
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, I...don't like to be the one to tell you this, but... ...I think Mr Sholmes is trying to say that your handwriting is a little...untidy.
Ryunosuke:
(Is...he making fun of me?)
Crime Scene Photograph
Sholmes:
Ah, the photograph I took earlier this morning. Yes, you may keep it.
Ryunosuke:
I still find it amazing that I can see something that happened so recently with my own eyes like this. What an incredible invention.
Sholmes:
And a convenient one, don't you think? I never travel without my trusty device. I am the most incurably impetuous devil, you see. I simply couldn't resist throwing it together.
Susato:
You...'threw it together'?
Sholmes:
And I intend to throw together a new and improved model that will capture colour! It's my personal monthly goal to see the invention finished before the thirty-first.
Ryunosuke:
(That would be useful. Then you could see that the ink Kazuma used was purple. But no! He couldn't have left that message! Not in Russian...)
Kazuma's Diary
Sholmes:
Ah yes, this is a crucial insight into the deep waters of this sordid case. An invaluable clue! And one that I discovered myself. ...But please, no praise! The work itself is my highest reward!
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma left his diary wide open in the middle of his desk.
Susato:
It sounds as if he saw something unusual just moments before he died.
Sholmes:
Ah yes, the 'speckled band' issuing from the ventilator that connects the adjoining cabin. Perhaps if I were a fraction slighter of build, I would be able to issue from the ventilator myself.
Ryunosuke:
A fraction slighter? Only a literal bean-pole could fit through there...
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Um, Mr Sholmes, what do you make of this?
Sholmes:
Shh! Quiet! When I'm ruminating in the course of my deductions, nothing must disturb my mind.
Ryunosuke:
Oh... So sorry...
Sholmes:
......... Ah, an Indian curry, perhaps...
Ryunosuke:
(What's he ruminating about? The lunch menu?)

Article About Revolutionary
Image of Vilen Borshevik on front
Susato:
I'm afraid I can't read a word of Russian.
Ryunosuke:
No, me neither. I have no idea what any of this says.
Sholmes:
The pair of you floundering is a sorry sight. Allow me to offer some assistance. The article on the front page of this newspaper is concerned with a fearsome Russian revolutionary. It reads: 'Revolutionary Vilen Borshevik Flees Russia via Shanghai'
Ryunosuke:
Yes, you told us that before.
Sholmes:
It reveals also, that those who see the man's beard with their own eyes never live to tell the tale!
Susato:
Oh my goodness! He IS fearsome!
Ryunosuke:
Well, presumably the newspaper photographer was alright, wasn't he?
Sholmes:
The solution is obvious, of course. If he despises his beard to that degree, he need only shave it off.
Susato:
I'm, I'm not quite sure that's the problem, Mr Sholmes...
Image of lady on backside
Ryunosuke:
Hm, this is interesting...
Susato:
Have you found something relevant, Naruhodo-san?
Ryunosuke:
Well, no, I... I mean it looks like it MIGHT be interesting.
Susato:
I can't read a single word, I'm afraid.
Ryunosuke:
No, nor can I. But look at this picture... Perhaps it's about a beautiful, young Russian princess, do you think?
Susato:
She is very pretty, isn't she? I suppose you enjoy articles like this, do you?
Ryunosuke:
I, I don't know. I can't make any sense of it!
Sholmes:
Ah, I'm glad you've noticed this article.
Susato:
Argh!
Sholmes:
Allow me to give you a short summary of its contents.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Thank you. (He pops up everywhere, this 'Mr Sholmes'.)
Sholmes:
It's about the disappearance of a young lady last night. 'Renowned Prima Ballerina of the Novavich Ballet Disappears from Shanghai!' During a performance in Shanghai, the famous dancer was reported missing. She is of course the talented, young Nikolina Pavlova.
Ryunosuke:
(Why are Russian names so hard to remember...?)
Sholmes:
It would appear the woman was in costume when she was found to be missing from her dressing room... ...wearing the diamond tiara you see pictured, which is worth some twenty thousand roubles.
Ryunosuke:
Oh. How much is twenty thousand roubles?
Susato:
I have no idea! But I'm quite sure... ...it must be an unbelievable sum of money!
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san's eyes are shining like diamonds themselves.)
Sholmes:
The tiara is the property of the Novavich Ballet. It would seem the director is beside herself with worry.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I'm not surprised.
Sholmes:
The company is most anxious to recover both Miss Pavlova and the valuable tiara. They've requested international assistance at all ports with sailings to Great Britain.
Susato:
Could this be another case of a Russian fleeing his or her country?
Ryunosuke:
It does seem to be the Russian thing to do...
Susato:
...I'm not even going to dignify that with a response, Mr Naruhodo.
The article about the ballerina has been entered into the Court Record.
Image of lady on backside (subsequent times)
Susato:
So according to what Mr Sholmes told us before...
Ryunosuke:
...This article is about a dancer from a Russian ballet company who has disappeared for some reason.
Susato:
Yes, a prima ballerina called Nikolina Pavlova. She went missing from her dressing room whilst the company was performing in Shanghai. And the tiara she was wearing at the time appears to be a very valuable piece of jewellery.
Ryunosuke:
What was it? Twenty thousand roubles?
Susato:
Yes. I have no idea how much that really is, but... ...I feel sure you'd be given change from that amount even after buying all the cakes in the cake shop!
Ryunosuke:
(Her imagination's really running away with her...)
Susato:
And now, in order to recover both Miss Pavlova and the valuable tiara... ...the company has requested international assistance at all ports with sailings to Great Britain.
After clearing all Converse options:
Sholmes:
So...I believe I've given you enough to consider for the time being at least.
Susato:
Ah, do you have somewhere to go?
Sholmes:
As it happens, the victim's writings in his diary have piqued my interest. The matter warrants further investigation, I believe. ...And if I am still too long, the seasickness takes hold.
Susato:
Oh, I suppose... ...you're thinking of investigating the cabin next door, which the ventilator connects to?
Sholmes:
Great detectives are a curious breed. Our minds rebel at stagnation. We crave mental exaltation. So yes, I intend to investigate. Hence the truth will become clear soon enough.
Ryunosuke:
Do you think perhaps...! That we could go with you?
Sholmes:
Hm...no, that would be somewhat complicated.
Ryunosuke:
What? But why?
Sholmes:
A simple glance at your wrists should reveal the answer.
Ryunosuke:
(Oh...these...)
Sholmes:
After all, you're the prime suspect in this matter...no?
Ryunosuke:
There's no point trying to turn it into a question. You're the one who decided I was the culprit in the first place.
Sholmes:
...Whatever do you mean? I have no recollection of naming you as the culprit at any point.
Ryunosuke:
......... You must be joking! You, you just said it! Only a moment ago!
Sholmes:
Dear me, you are clearly misguided. I would have no cause to say such a thing.
Susato:
Well actually, Mr Sholmes... I did hear you say that, too.
Sholmes:
You're quite sure? ...Well, that's very strange. I wouldn't have said you had the face of a criminal, you know? ...Not...really.
Ryunosuke:
(So what, were you looking at my knees before? Some great detective you are...)
Sholmes:
Well anyway. That was then and this is now.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Sholmes:
What I mean, sir, is this: If you are the culprit, then you must play the part more convincingly! Roll over and accept your fate! Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
Ryunosuke:
(Now he's just being plain rude. And off he goes, having just laughed in my face... His sense of humour's as twisted as his name...)
Susato:
Naruhodo-san! What are you just standing there for?
Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Susato:
We must go and investigate the cabin next door as well!
Ryunosuke:
Aren't you forgetting something? What about these? There's no way I can-
Susato:
Haiiiiiii-YA! After Kazuma-sama spent his dying moments struggling to leave us a clue, you're willing to give up?! You're just going to roll over and accept your fate?!
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (As if you gave me any choice in the rolling over part...) I think we still have some investigation to finish off in here first, don't we? Let's carry on examining what we can in this cabin while we wait for a chance to slip next door.
Susato:
Good idea! 
Ryunosuke:
(The situation doesn't look good for me, but there are still things I can do to help myself. And I owe it to Kazuma to do everything I can to find a way out of this...and bring the real culprit to justice!)
Examine
Sailor in corner
Ryunosuke:
Um...excuse me.
Sailor:
What?
Ryunosuke:
I was wondering if I could ask you a favour... Would you mind if I investigated a little outside?
Sailor:
......... Grandmother told me Japanese people do not make jokes, but is not true, I see.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sailor:
The kriminal asking prison guard to help him escape? Very funny.
Ryunosuke:
We're in the middle of the sea. There's no chance of me escaping...
Sailor:
Nyett! You stay in this cabin until next port! Then it is up to Hong Kong police to decide what they do with you. You stay!
Ryunosuke:
...Alright. (There's no point trying to appeal to this mean's better nature, that's for sure.)
Move
Ryunosuke:
Thanks to that so-called detective, I'm even more stuck inside this cabin than I was before. For the time being, I suppose I'll just have to focus my efforts on investigating in here.
If door, sign, shelf, chicken dinner/knife, and broken glass/floor mark have not been examined yet
After examining door, sign, shelf, chicken dinner/knife, and broken glass/floor mark:
Ryunosuke:
Oh, look over there...
Susato:
The crewman, do you mean? He wasn't there before, was he?
Ryunosuke:
That's what I thought.
Susato:
Why don't we try talking to him?
Ryunosuke:
(Probably because I'm likely to get yelled at again. But I suppose I could try...)
Examine
Sailor in front of sign
Leads to:
"Is that...?"
If door, sign, shelf, chicken dinner/knife, and broken glass/floor mark have already been examined
Leads to:
"Is that...?"
Ryunosuke:
(Is that...?)
Susato:
Is something wrong, Naruhodo-san?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, no. It's just that crewman standing by the door. I can't help feeling like I've seen him somewhere before.
Susato:
Oh yes, you're right. He does look familiar. ...Excuse me, sir!
Sailor:
...Yes? What can I do for you?
Ryunosuke:
......... (I recognise that face! But, but it can't be...)
Sailor:
Ahem! ...Ahem, ahem!
Ryunosuke:
(It is!)
Susato:
I, I didn't know you were here, Inspector Hosonaga!
Hosonaga:
Hello again.
Ryunosuke:
What are you doing here?!
Hosonaga:
I think that should be my line. I was so stunned when I saw you, my heart stopped.
Susato:
Nearly stopped...I hope.
Hosonaga:
I received some special orders to go undercover as a member of the crew and board this ship.
Ryunosuke:
(Again?)
Susato:
You certainly seem to enjoy undercover work, Inspector.
Hosonaga:
If there's anything I can do to help you, please ask.
Ryunosuke:
(I never expected to see this man on board. But perhaps his presence can help me out of this hopeless situation...)
Examine
Desk
Susato:
This is where dear Kazuma-sama would have sat whenever he was writing...
Ryunosuke:
'London Diary'... (Poor Kazuma. He didn't even make it to his destination...)
Susato:
The last entry that he made is such a mystery. '1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint whistling sound. 1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.' What on earth could it all mean?
Ryunosuke:
A speckled band from the ventilator... We really do need to get into the cabin next door, seeing as that's where the ventilator connects to.
Susato:
Yes, I agree with you.
Converse
Special orders
Ryunosuke:
So what are your special orders this time, Inspector?
Susato:
Yes, and why are you dressed as a member of the crew?
Hosonaga:
......... I'm so sorry.
Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Hosonaga:
This is all my fault. I take full responsibility.
Ryunosuke:
For, for what?
Hosonaga:
My orders were...to act as Asogi-san's bodyguard.
Susato:
...!
Hosonaga:
It was Minister of Justice Jigoku who pushed for this overseas study tour to go ahead. And he entrusted me with ensuring that Asogi-san reached Great Britain without being assassinated.
Ryunosuke:
Assassinated?! How, how could that even have been a possibility?
Hosonaga:
I'm not sure. But these are complicated times. There are tensions between the world's greatest powers. Minister Jigoku said we should be prepared for all eventualities.
Ryunosuke:
(This is incredible...)
Susato:
I, I don't believe it! Kazuma-sama was assassinated...?
Hosonaga:
Obviously we couldn't give Asogi-san a visible security escort. Which is why I'm undercover now, posing as one of the crew.
Susato:
I see...
Hosonaga:
And I didn't take my eyes off him the entire time we've been on board. From morning until night, every day. But I never imagined it would happen here, inside his own cabin. Not here on the first-class deck...
Susato:
.........
Hosonaga:
I've failed miserably at my assignment. And Asogi-san is dead as a result. I'm a disgrace! All I can do is humbly apologise.
Ryunosuke:
Inspector...
Hosonaga:
So if there's anything at all that I can do to help now... ...just say the word!
Permission to investigate
Ryunosuke:
We're doing what we can to investigate Kazuma's death ourselves.
Hosonaga:
I thought you might be. You didn't do it, did you? You're not the killer?
Ryunosuke:
Of course not!
Susato:
We'd really like to investigate the cabin next door.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, so we need to be allowed out of this cabin!
Hosonaga:
......... I'm sorry.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Hosonaga:
You've been deemed a risk to the ship's safety. If you moved to even touch the handle of the cabin door... That stormy-looking seaman there would surely snap your neck in two.
Ryunosuke:
I suppose...I'm not just a stowaway now. They think I'm a murderer as well.
Hosonaga:
......... Would it be possible... ...to give me something to work with, do you think? I'm going to need something persuasive.
Susato:
What do you mean?
Hosonaga:
If I had a solid reason why the next-door cabin should be investigated, for example... ...I'd do everything I could to persuade the captain to allow it. Really, I'd lay my life on the line if I had to.
Ryunosuke:
But...I don't see how...
Susato:
......... There may be a way.
Ryunosuke:
What?! Really?
Susato:
Think of how you tried to persuade me of your innocence, Naruhodo-san. By presenting me with a piece of evidence that you already had in your possession.
Ryunosuke:
Evidence...?
Susato:
It's just the same as when you are in court. You must have done it many times during your trial. Simply select the 'Present' panel... ...and choose some evidence that Inspector Hosonaga could use.
Ryunosuke:
(So...evidence that would give us a viable reason to investigate the next-door cabin, is it?) ...Alright, yes. I, I think I might know what we can use. (Let's see if I can Present the detective with the evidence he needs to persuade the captain.)
Permission to investigate (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
Please, Inspector Hosonaga! We really need permission to go into the cabin next door so we can investigate in there!
Hosonaga:
......... I'm sorry. Like I said, we need to give the captain a compelling reason.
Ryunosuke:
Right. A reason why it's so important that we're allowed to investigate the next-door cabin.
Hosonaga:
Exactly.
Susato:
There's only one way to do that. It's very similar to the situation you had with me before, Naruhodo-san. You need to present some evidence to the detective.
Ryunosuke:
Alright, I understand. 'Present' some evidence... (Let's see if I can present the detective with the evidence he needs to persuade the captain.)
Permission to investigate (after presenting Kazuma's Diary)
Hosonaga:
I can't leave this cabin at the moment. I'm stuck here until we arrive at the next port. The captain has given me strict orders to guard the scene of the crime, you see. I'll have to entrust the investigation to you.
Susato:
Really? You're willing to do that?
Hosonaga:
Yes. As long as you don't leave the first-class cabin area. I'm afraid I can't remove those handcuffs, though.
Ryunosuke:
But...what about the captain? Aren't you going against his direct orders?
Hosonaga:
Ahem! ...Ahem, ahem! I'm a man of my word. And I promise you that I'll lay my life on the line if that's what it takes to convince the captain. After all...  ...I failed to keep Asogi-san safe. This is the least I can do.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you.
Susato:
Let's seize the moment then, Naruhodo-san! Just select 'Move' and we can leave this cabin at last!
Ryunosuke:
('Move'... Alright! Let's see what we can find out!)
Move
Ryunosuke:
I can't just roll over and accept my fate. I have to find a way out of this cabin! If I'm going to turn this desperate situation around somehow... ...then the inspector in front of me is my only chance!
Present
University Collar Pin
Ryunosuke:
Inspector, can I show you this?
Hosonaga:
What the...?! Is that a fabled Imperial Yumei University pin badge?!
Ryunosuke:
Erm...I'm not sure if it's really fabled exactly, but...
Hosonaga:
So...you're a genuine 'student' then.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Hosonaga:
Nothing like me, with my regular schooling. You're something much greater. Is that what you were trying to say?
Ryunosuke:
Um...can I have my badge back, please?
Paper Seal
Hosonaga:
Ah, this is the paper seal that was stuck over the wardrobe doors this morning, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
That's right. To try to stop the cabin steward opening it up and discovering me.
Hosonaga:
...Wouldn't it have been better to write it in English if you didn't know Russian?
Ryunosuke:
Maybe, but 'ofuda' paper amulets like this are a part of our culture, Inspector. And I thought if I made it look creepy enough, people would be too scared to want to look inside.
Hosonaga:
...It isn't easy being a stowaway, is it?
Crime Scene Photograph
Ryunosuke:
Um...have you seen this photograph yet, Inspector?
Hosonaga:
Ahem! Ahe... Ahe... .........
Susato:
Oh dear! Are you alright, Inspector?
Hosonaga:
......... Yes, I'm sorry. I'm fine. I was hoping to hide my upset with a fit of coughing and spluttering. I'm usually very good at it. But trying to stifle my feelings seems to have stifled my cough this time.
Susato:
It's all so sad.
Hosonaga:
Asogi-san was such a promising young man. The empire had such high hopes for him. I had such high hopes for him! Even though I'm just a detective... Ahem! ...Ahem, ahem, ahem!
Ryunosuke:
(We're all going to miss you, Kazuma.)
Article About Revolutionary or Article about Ballerina
Ryunosuke:
Can I show you this newspaper, Inspector?
Hosonaga:
I'm sorry, but I can't read Russian very well.
Ryunosuke:
Oh no, that's alright. I know what it says.
Hosonaga:
......... So you just wanted to point out your university-level linguistic talents, is that it?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Hosonaga:
Nothing like me, with my regular schooling. You're something much greater. Is that what you were trying to say?
Ryunosuke:
...Sorry. Forget I mentioned it.
Kazuma's Diary
Hosonaga:
What's that?
Ryunosuke:
It's Kazuma's diary.
Susato:
Just before he died, Kazuma-sama wrote something rather strange in his diary.
Hosonaga:
Strange? In what way?
Susato:
He wrote, 'What looks like some kind of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.'
Hosonaga:
A 'speckled band'? That is strange.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, we're still trying to work out what he meant by that. But what I'd like to know is-
Hosonaga:
Don't tell me. The ventilator, is it?
Susato:
You're very astute, Inspector.
Hosonaga:
That ventilator clearly joins to the next-door cabin.
Ryunosuke:
That's right. So if we could investigate in there, we might be able to work out what the speckled band was!
Hosonaga:
......... Alright then.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Hosonaga:
I can't leave this cabin at the moment. I'm stuck here until we arrive at the next port. The captain has given me strict orders to guard the scene of the crime, you see. I'll have to entrust the investigation to you.
Susato:
Really? You're willing to do that?
Hosonaga:
Yes. As long as you don't leave the first-class cabin area. I'm afraid I can't remove those handcuffs, though.
Ryunosuke:
But...what about the captain? Aren't you going against his direct orders?
Hosonaga:
Ahem! ...Ahem, ahem! I'm a man of my word. And I promise you that I'll lay my life on the line if that's what it takes to convince the captain. After all...  ...I failed to keep Asogi-san safe. This is the least I can do.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you.
Susato:
Let's seize the moment then, Naruhodo-san! Just select 'Move' and we can leave this cabin at last!
Ryunosuke:
('Move'... Alright! Let's see what we can find out!)
Kazuma's Diary (subsequent times)
Hosonaga:
Ah yes, Asogi-san's diary... 'Some sort of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille', or some such? The ventilator in this cabin looks like it joins to the next-door cabin.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. So if we investigate next door, we might start to understand... ...what this 'speckled band' that Kazuma saw really was.
Hosonaga:
If you do work it out, please let me know at once.
Ryunosuke:
Of course.
9th January, 7:48 a.m.
SS Burya, First-Class Cabin Passageway
Ryunosuke:
(Whew, I'm finally out of that cabin...) I have to admit, this isn't quite what I was expecting. It's less spacious out here than I thought it would be. And this is the most luxurious accommodation...
Susato:
Yes, indeed. Kazuma-sama was being sent on this study tour by the government. That's why he was being put up in a first-class cabin. Even still, this is about twice as large as my accommodation in steerage.
Ryunosuke:
Really? That must be awful. Oh! Look over there! That's another crewman keeping watch. And he looks enormous! Even if he is sitting down!
Susato:
The door next to him leads to the second-class accommodation. I suppose he's making sure that no one comes in here who shouldn't.
Ryunosuke:
I suppose... (Like people in handcuffs?)
Susato:
Naruhodo-san, you look like a little boy visiting a toy shop for the first time. I would have thought you'd be used to the ship by now. We've been at sea for two weeks already.
Ryunosuke:
Well yes, I know. But the thing is... ...I was inside Kazuma's trunk when I first came aboard. And ever since then I've been shut up inside that little wardrobe.
Susato:
...It must have been a very trying time for you.
Ryunosuke:
Please, don't give me that pitying look.
Examine
Sailor
Ryunosuke:
Um... Excuse me, but...could I ask you something?
Sailor:
You? You little stowaway murderer!
Ryunosuke:
That wasn't a good start, was it?
Susato:
Alright... Let me try instead! Good day, Mr Sailor. I'm so sorry to trouble you, but could I perhaps ask something of you?
Sailor:
You? You little third-class lady's maid?
Susato:
Oh...
Ryunosuke:
We seem to have caught this sailor on a bad day, Susato-san.
Sailor:
I am not 'sailor'! My mother gave me name! I am senior crewman, Bif Strogenov.
Ryunosuke:
(Whew... The best thing is just to avoid eye contact, I think...)
First-class cabin area
Ryunosuke:
Erm...Mr Strogenov... About this first-class cabin area...
Strogenov:
Here we are in finest part of Burya steamship. For very important persons.
Ryunosuke:
What sort of very important persons?
Strogenov:
Government officials, kings and queens travelling in secret... Many important persons. That is why I am always guarding this place.
Ryunosuke:
Gosh... That's...amazing.
Strogenov:
But somehow I let stupid stowaway inside. I want to pick you up and throw you in ocean. ...But Strogenov is not animal.
Ryunosuke:
...Thank you?
Susato:
If I may, I was wondering... ...is the cabin next to Mr Asogi's currently occupied?
Strogenov:
Да!
Ryunosuke:
Um, Susato-san... Did you understand that?
Susato:
It sounded like 'da'. I think it's probably Russian for 'yes'. ...Or 'no'.
Ryunosuke:
......... Genius.
Strogenov:
It is not permitted to visit other cabins without invitations.
Ryunosuke:
...! Well, it sounds like there is somebody in the next-door cabin at least.
Susato:
Yes. It's tantalising...
Passenger in the next-door cabin (appears after "First-class cabin area")
Ryunosuke:
Could you tell us who's travelling in the cabin next to Mr Asogi's?
Strogenov:
......... His name is Mr Grimesby Roylott. He is very important Western gentleman.
Ryunosuke:
(A Western gentleman...)
Strogenov:
Do not think about it! He has nothing to do with murder of student boy.
Ryunosuke:
How can you be so sure about that?
Strogenov:
Mr Roylott is authentic Western gentleman. Such a man would have no interest in lowly student from insignificant Far East islands.
Ryunosuke:
(That was harsh.)
Susato:
Could you tell us when Mr Roylott came aboard?
Strogenov:
......... That is not your business.
Ryunosuke:
(Come to think of it... ...even though we've been at sea for two weeks now, and I've been in Kazuma's cabin the entire time... ...I've never once heard anything from the next-door cabin. Or even felt like there's anyone there.)
Susato:
Well presumably, since this gentleman is occupying one of the first-class cabins... ...he must be rather important. Is that right?
Strogenov:
......... That is not your business.
Last night
Ryunosuke:
Um, are you on watch here all the time, Seaman Strogenov?
Strogenov:
Da. All time. So kriminals like you cannot come in... or get out.
Susato:
I wonder...could you tell us anything about last night at all?
Strogenov:
......... It is sad about student boy.
Ryunosuke:
Were you on watch last night as well?
Strogenov:
......... Of course.
Ryunosuke:
And did you notice anything at the time? Anything unusual?
Strogenov:
......... Нет!
Ryunosuke:
Um, Susato-san... Did you understand that?
Susato:
It was clearly a 'no'!
Strogenov:
I saw nothing unusual. Nothing at all.
Ryunosuke:
And you didn't hear any strange noises? Or sense anything was wrong in some way?
Strogenov:
I said NO!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry! (I'm not so sure... I could have sworn that he wouldn't catch my eye for a moment there.)
Blue door
Susato:
That's the way to the second-class area of the ship.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
Is something wrong?
Ryunosuke:
I...was thinking about making a run for it. Just for a moment. Things...aren't exactly going well for me.
Susato:
I might be wrong, but I imagine the moment you reach for the handle of the door... ...that burly seaman would surely shoot you dead.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
Oh dear. I'm sorry. Perhaps I went a little too far there.
Ryunosuke:
No, I started it with my talk of running away. (And there's no way I could run away while Kazuma's death remains a mystery anyway.)
Book
Ryunosuke:
That's a huge book on top of the table there. And there's a pen next to it.
Susato:
Yes, that looks like the ship's log.
Ryunosuke:
Shall we have a little look through it? .........
Susato:
The writing is so neat and precise! Every detail about the voyage has been meticulously recorded!
Ryunosuke:
Hm... You wouldn't expect a rough and ready sailor to have such beautiful handwriting.
Sailor/Strogenov:
.........
Ryunosuke:
And...nothing. No reaction at all. I thought he might appreciate the compliment.
Susato:
I'm not sure that 'rough and ready' is much of a compliment, Naruhodo-san. Even to a sailor. Anyway, last night's log is mostly blank.
Ryunosuke:
Presumably that means there was nothing to report.
Susato:
.........
Ship map
Ryunosuke:
This looks like a plan of the SS Burya. It shows each deck, look.
Susato:
The Burya is a large-scale steamship with a triple-skinned hull. What a marvel of engineering!
Ryunosuke:
Well it's been playing on my mind for a while now, actually, but... How is it that such a huge lump of metal doesn't just sink to the bottom of the ocean?
Susato:
Oh, that's really quite simple, Naruhodo-san.
Ryunosuke:
It is?
Susato:
Well...consider the Japanese archipelago.
Ryunosuke:
The islands of Japan?
Susato:
Yes. They're not metal, but they are enormous lumps of earth, many, many times larger than this ship. And they don't sink, do they? They've been floating happily on the sea since the gods created them.
Ryunosuke:
Well...I suppose so...
Cabin door on left
Ryunosuke:
'First-Class Cabin No. 1'... Yes, that's our cabin.
Susato:
Not 'our' cabin. It's Kazuma-sama's.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
Your accommodation is confined to the wardrobe inside the cabin.
Ryunosuke:
You know how to make a stowaway feel small, don't you? As small as the wardrobe I've been calling home.
Susato:
These cabins are the finest on the ship. My own cabin in steerage is number 539, by the way.
Ryunosuke:
Five hundred and...? How many cabins are there?!
Mousetrap
Susato:
Ah, a trap for catching mice.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, we have plenty of those back home in Japan. Although they seem to be using a lump of chalk or something as bait.
Susato:
Let me see... Yes, I think that's what is called 'cheese'. It's made from the milk of cows.
Ryunosuke:
'Cheese'? (I wonder what that tastes like...)
Susato:
You can't eat it, Naruhodo-san. The trap will snap shut on your fingers.
Ryunosuke:
Really? But... Haah... I suppose you're right.
Susato:
...You weren't actually going to try it, were you?
Ryunosuke:
All I've had to eat for the past couple of weeks is Kazuma's leftovers. You don't know how hungry I've been in that wardrobe.
Susato:
...Poor you. I'll find a little snack for you later.
Alarm
Ryunosuke:
What do you think this is? It's a very pleasing shape, isn't it?
Susato:
That's the emergency alarm. It's probably best not to touch it.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, an alarm...
Susato:
It says, 'Press only in times of emergency.' It looks as though it sets alarm bells ringing all over the ship. And brings the vessel to a complete stop.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, this I have to see...
Susato:
What are you doing, Naruhodo-san?! You mustn't touch it!
Ryunosuke:
But this is an emergency situation! Just look at these handcuffs!
Susato:
You know full well that's not what the alarm is for. If you were to bring this vessel to a standstill for no good reason, you'd be in an even worse situation!
Ryunosuke:
Haah... I wish everything would just stop. This ship included.
Susato:
If you have to do something foolish, at least make it something that doesn't affect anyone else.
Cabin door on right
Ryunosuke:
This is it... This is the cabin next to ours. The one the ventilator connects to.
Susato:
Yes, the ventilator from which Kazuma-sama wrote that he saw a 'speckled band' emerging.
Ryunosuke:
Maybe whoever's in this cabin can help solve that particular mystery. Let's ask!
Sailor/Strogenov:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Oh. Um...
Sailor/Strogenov:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Excuse me, we, um...need to get inside this cabin here.
Sailor/Strogenov:
.........
Susato:
This sailor's eyes speak volumes. They're clearly saying, 'Keep out!'
Ryunosuke:
That's what I wrote on the sign we put over the wardrobe doors. (Although this man's version is definitely more effective.)
Susato:
It doesn't look like he's going to let us pass.
Ryunosuke:
Hm, that's a problem...
After clearing all Converse options with Bif Strogenov:
Strogenov:
This is enough. I cannot say more now.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Strogenov:
It is time for me to report to captain. You must return to cabin.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, alright...
Strogenov:
Bulkhead to second-class area is staying locked at all times. You escape when the lobster whistles on top of the mountain. Or, as English say...when the pigs fly.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I understand.
Susato:
Good, now we can investigate this area properly! Shall we?
Ryunosuke:
Definitely!
Examine
Book
Ryunosuke:
That book on top of the table there really is huge. There's a pen with it, too.
Susato:
Yes, I'm sure that's the ship's log.
Ryunosuke:
Shall we have a little look through it? .........
Susato:
The writing is so neat and precise! Every detail about the voyage has been meticulously recorded!
Ryunosuke:
Hm... You wouldn't expect a rough and ready sailor to have such beautiful handwriting.
Susato:
Anyway...look here... Last night's log is mostly blank.
Ryunosuke:
Presumably that means there was nothing to report.
Cabin door on right
Ryunosuke:
This is it... This is the cabin next to ours. The one the ventilator connects to.
Susato:
Yes, the ventilator from which Kazuma-sama wrote that he saw a 'speckled band' emerging.
Ryunosuke:
Maybe whoever's in this cabin can help solve that particular mystery. Let's ask!
*Knock knock*
.........
Susato:
No answer. We're out of luck, it seems. There's no one in there to help with our enquiries.
Ryunosuke:
How annoying.
After examining cabin door on right and alarm:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
Ryunosuke:
What was that?! (It came from inside the cabin!) 
Susato:
Such a high-pitched scream... It must have been a woman!
???:
Stand aside!
Sholmes:
I'm about to break the door down!
Susato:
Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
I shan't be stopped! When the fit is on me, I revel in kicking doors off their hinges!
Susato:
Please- Wait, Mr Sholmes. The door doesn't appear to be bolted.
Sholmes:
It doesn't? Then how the deuce can I dispatch this muscular urge? What, pray, CAN I kick?!
Ryunosuke:
I, I think we should go in. There's no time to think about stress relief!
9th January
SS Burya, First-Class Cabin No. 2
???:
Who, who are you?!
Ryunosuke:
(A Western gentleman? This man looks Russian to me.) We, we heard a woman scream.
???:
A woman? Don't be absurd! As you can see...there's nobody but me in this cabin.
Ryunosuke:
(True. This old man does appear to be the only person in here. But in that case...who just screamed?)
Old Man:
Get out! All of you! Now!
Sholmes:
Please excuse the intrusion, but... You're Mr Grimesby Roylott, I believe?
Roylott:
Yes, that's me. And you are...?
Sholmes:
I am the one and only - the actual Herlock Sholmes! You've heard of me, no doubt.
Roylott:
No.
Sholmes:
I am a great detective among great detectives! One who adorns the covers of popular magazines, no less! So I assure you, you may trust me completely!
Ryunosuke:
(The man uses that magazine like a business card.)
Roylott:
A detective? Hm, I do not trust detectives.
Sholmes:
We distinctly heard a scream emanating from within these walls. But there wouldn't appear to be a lady concealing herself within the wardrobe this time... ...so might I be so bold as to ask you to open that small travelling case?
Roylott:
Wha...? Don't be stupid! How could anyone fit in a small trunk like that?
Sholmes:
Well it's quite fashionable these days, is it not? Travelling inside one's trunk.
Ryunosuke:
...Don't look at me.
Susato:
Oh my- Did, did you see that, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! (The case just shook!)
Roylott:
Leave! Now! Otherwise I'll call the steward!
Ryunosuke:
(So this is Kazuma's neighbour... Mr Grimesby Roylott. There's no doubt about it... This strange Russian man is hiding something!)
Susato:
I couldn't agree more. Let's see if we can find some clues before that burly sailor returns!
Examine
Herlock Sholmes or wardrobe
Leads to:
"Um...do you have a moment, please, Mr Sholmes?"
Anything else
Roylott:
What do you think you're doing?!
Susato:
Agh!
Roylott:
This is MY cabin! Get out!
Susato:
Could we just have a quick look inside your travelling case, perhaps?
Roylott:
NO!
Susato:
Haah... What a pity. I think we're out of luck.
Ryunosuke:
I think you're right.
Susato:
There doesn't appear to be anything more we can do.
Ryunosuke:
I agree. (But there may be someone else who can help... Perhaps that great detective could get somewhere with Mr Roylott...)
Converse
Any option
Ryunosuke:
Mr Roylott, we'd like to talk to you about something.
Roylott:
No!
Ryunosuke:
Oh!
Roylott:
I do not want to talk. Leave my cabin now!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, this is going terribly...)
Susato:
We're not getting anywhere here.
Ryunosuke:
I agree. (But there may be someone else who can help... Perhaps that great detective could get somewhere with Mr Roylott...)
Present
Paper Seal
Ryunosuke:
Have you seen this before?
Roylott:
...I've never seen those strange letters before in my life.
Ryunosuke:
It says 'Keep out 'in Japanese.
Roylott:
...I haven't heard of that language.
Ryunosuke:
(Seriously? Is the Empire of Japan really that insignificant on the world stage?)
Crime Scene Photograph
Ryunosuke:
This word was written on the floor in ink next to where the man died, as if he wrote it in his last moments.
Susato:
It's Russian, isn't it? We believe it means 'wardrobe'. Is that right?
Roylott:
Yes, that's right.
Ryunosuke:
Could you tell us how it's pronounced, please?
Roylott:
ГАРДЕРОБ.
Ryunosuke:
(Oh. That...was pointless...)
Roylott:
......... It is very sad.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Roylott:
The steward told me. He was a young man.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. He was my best friend.
Susato:
......... it's a terrible tragedy.
Article About Revolutionary or Article About Ballerina
Ryunosuke:
We have this Russian newspaper here...
Roylott:
I had the same newspaper in my cabin. Maybe they give it to all first-class passengers.
Ryunosuke:
Well, neither of us speak a word of Russian, so we can't read it at all. Would you mind telling us what this article is about?
Roylott:
......... If you do not speak Russian, you do not need to know what it is saying.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... Russia must be a cold, cold place.)
Kazuma's Diary
Ryunosuke:
Um, have you seen this?
Roylott:
I don't know what that is. I can't read it.
Ryunosuke:
It's a travel diary written by the man who was killed. It's in Japanese.
Roylott:
...I haven't heard of that language.
Ryunosuke:
(Seriously? Is the Empire of Japan really that insignificant on the world stage?)
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Mr Roylott, what do you make of this?
Roylott:
Listen... Do you know why I am wearing these dark glasses?
Ryunosuke:
Um...no, not really.
Roylott:
So I do not have to look at things I do not want to look at. Do you understand me?
Ryunosuke:
......... (I wish I could point out that you can still see things, even when wearing sunglasses... But his chilly air has frozen my lips shut.)
Ryunosuke:
Um...do you have a moment, please, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
You need only address me as Sholmes.
Ryunosuke:
(That's...what I just did, isn't it?) Well, um, Mr Sholmes...what were you doing in there?
Sholmes:
Why, I was resting, of course.
Susato:
Resting?
Sholmes:
Indeed. I was contemplating our sea voyage from the confines of the wardrobe whilst waiting. Waiting for the inevitable time...that you would need to call my great powers of detection into service.
Susato:
Oh! 
Sholmes:
And it would seem that the hour is upon us now. The time has come! Am I mistaken?
Ryunosuke:
Well, um... (No, actually. You're spot on...for once.)
Sholmes:
Observe closely... Our Russian host in this cabin, Mr Roylott, is clearly trying to hide something. And do you know what is the most effective weapon to use against a Russian hiding a secret? Why, the truth, of course! Though it should be pointed out that such methods are not exclusively for the Russians.
Ryunosuke:
Riiight...
Sholmes:
Can you imagine how the Russian will react when the secret he guards so closely is exposed? Would you like to witness it?
Susato:
Oh, yes! Please!
Sholmes:
Well then... What you are about to see may well astound you. For I am about to apply my great detective's greatly admired great deduction to the case!
Sholmes:
Could this man BE a more hackneyed portrayal of a dubious Russian, I ask you?
Roylott:
What?
Sholmes:
From time to time, it occurs to me... ...is the fellow dubious on account of his Russianness, or Russian on account of his dubiousness?
Ryunosuke:
I, I really don't think either of those things should be occurring to you...or anyone.
Susato:
That's right. And Mr Sholmes... I know this man's beard and dark glasses are hard to ignore, especially on first meeting, but I once read: 'It is a capital mistake to theorise before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.'
Sholmes:
Shh! I must have complete silence! .........
Roylott:
Wh-What are you doing? Why are you peering at my face like that?
Sholmes:
Ah, just as I thought. Yes, I have quite made up my mind now.
Roylott:
Hm?
Sholmes:
There can be no other explanation that accommodates all the facts. Mr Roylott... I have reached two incontrovertible conclusions.
Roylott:
What, what do you mean?
Sholmes:
Number one! Your true identity...is that of a villain! Using those shears, you are about to end the existence of something most dear. ...Are you not?
Roylott:
Huh!
Sholmes:
And number two! The other conclusion I have drawn... You are...at this very moment no less, in the midst of committing a most grievous crime! Beneath that beard, your mouth quivers with nervous tension as you realise you have been discovered! ...Does it not?
Roylott:
Agh!
Susato:
Oh, Naruhodo-san! I never imagined I would witness one of Mr Sholmes's great deductions with my own eyes!
Ryunosuke:
That...was a great deduction?
Susato:
Nothing can deceive Mr Sholmes! In a single glance, he can deduce all there is to know about a person!
Ryunosuke:
What? (What ineffable twaddle!)
Susato:
Oh yes, I've read about it countless times in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. ...And now I've experienced the astonishing impact of his great deduction firsthand! This is like a dream come true!
Ryunosuke:
(I can hardly believe it, but...all the colour has drained from Mr Roylott's face! It looks like somehow, both of Mr Sholmes's conclusions... were right!)
Roylott:
How...? How could you...?
Sholmes:
'How could I possibly know such things?' you wish to say? Very well then, I shall elucidate. I shall explain how it was that I arrived at this pair of conclusions. So do I cordially invite you upon a journey of logical discovery! Let us board the train of reasoning! ...Put plainly, let us work through my deductions together.
The Great DeductionThe game is afoot!
Topic 1
Old Man's Identity
Sholmes:
So, the dubious-looking Russian, Mr Roylott... Obviously, what catches the eye in the first place... ...is the enormous pair of shears in your hand! Now, we ask ourselves, what could you possibly want with such an implement? The answer, of course, is staring us in the face. You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the copious beard  you sport! Now, moving on... The question then begged is this: Why would you desire to rid yourself of this magnificent beard, Mr Roylott? Once again, the answer is plain. We have clear evidence to shed light on the matter.
Roylott:
...!
Sholmes:
Regard, if you will, this morning's newspaper. In particular, the fascinating front-page article. Which, it would appear, you have read also, Mr Roylott. I'm sure it needs no further clarification. The evidence that reveals your true identity...is the article about the revolutionary! In translation, the headline reads: 'Revolutionary Vilen Borshevik Flees Russia via Shanghai'. As you cannot fail to observe, the subject of the article possesses an extremely copious beard. Having noted the article yourself, you decided to remove your incriminating facial hair before it gave you away. In short, your true identity is beyond doubt. You are the fearsome Russian revolutionary himself, Vilen Borshevik! ...Not that I've heard of you myself, you understand.

Wrongdoing
Sholmes:
Now...as for my second conclusion... You are, at this very moment, on the brink of committing a most grievous crime.
Roylott:
...!
Sholmes:
And the proof of this crime? Over there. Oh yes, Mr Roylott... Taken unawares, people have a propensity to let their eyes stray, you see.
Roylott:
Ah!
Sholmes:
And I assure you, the eyes speak so much more eloquently - and honestly - than the mouth. The answer we seek lies where the furtive glance falls. The proof of your crime sits before our very eyes! Yes, that travelling case! It is time, I think, that the case be opened and its contents laid bare.
Roylott:
No! I refuse!
Sholmes:
What could you possibly be concealing inside, we ask? By my estimation... ...a young lady, perhaps. One slight enough to fit therein.
Roylott:
D-Don't be absurd!
Sholmes:
And what, pray, would be the identity of this young lady in the travelling case? Dear me. We are not well suited to a life of crime, are we? Your careless coup d'oeil betrays you. Once again, we need only follow your furtive glance to find the answer. Yes, the reason you refuse to open your travelling case can equally be found in the pages of this newspaper. For there is another, most stimulating article... ...if we turn from the fleeing revolutionary... to the back page! 'Renowned Prima Ballerina of the Novavich Ballet Disappears from Shanghai!' Such a headline can lead us to but one conclusion. Your crime...is that of abduction! And according to the article, the young lady's name is Nikolina Pavlova.

Kidnapping of a young ballerina
Sholmes:
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this Russian enigma! ...Elementski!
Ryunosuke:
......... Susato-san... That wasn't one of the great deductions I've been hearing so much about...was it?
Susato:
Well, um...the stories are full of Mr Sholmes's brilliant deductions, you know. But that...did seem a little different somehow...
Ryunosuke:
Excuse me, Mr Sholmes! Could you come over here a moment?
Sholmes:
Pray, what can I do for you?
Ryunosuke:
It's about your deductions. Would you mind?
Sholmes:
Not at all. Go on.
Ryunosuke:
Well, to start with, there's the newspaper article. I think we had the same discussion before, but... ...these two men look nothing like each other!
Sholmes:
Ah yes, I recall our discussion earlier. And at the time, I believe I told you... ...that the man is a revolutionary. Well able to revolutionise his own appearance.
Susato:
In fairness to Mr Sholmes, Mr Roylott does look more like this man than you do.
Ryunosuke:
That's...not the point. And another thing! The part about him abducting the ballerina...
Sholmes:
Indeed. A truly startling revelation. At first glance, the case would appear too small to accommodate a young woman.
Ryunosuke:
Not just at first glance! It IS too small! Clearly! You'd be lucky to fit a five-year-old child into that case! Even if you pushed really hard!
Susato:
I don't suppose the missing ballerina is a five-year-old child, is she?
Sholmes:
You mean you don't know? No, the young lady is fifteen.
Ryunosuke:
No, I didn't know. How could I?
Susato:
Hm... Well, if she's fifteen, then ten years' worth of her would be poking out from the case...
Sholmes:
Some years ago, I read something pertinent, I believe. A troupe of men consuming vinegar daily in order to promote a certain litheness in their bodies.
Ryunosuke:
Vinegar?
Sholmes:
For such a sour bunch, it would surely be simplicity itself to contort oneself into the confines of that small case.
Susato:
Oh dear. You might be thinking of contortionists in the circus, Mr Sholmes...
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, this whole thing is turning into a circus...)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, something's occurred to me about Mr Sholmes's deductions just now... I think his powers of observation are, well...magical! His eyes cut to the heart of a matter almost instantly. It's just...where he directs his attention and his logic that seem a little...off.
Ryunosuke:
Your idea of 'a little' may be a little off itself, Miss Susato.
Susato:
It's just one or two key words in his deductions that seem to let him down. So I was wondering if we might perhaps tactfully switch them for alternatives. What do you think?
Ryunosuke:
Hm... Switch some key words in his deductions...
Susato:
Yes, but very tactfully. I feel sure if we could do that... ...we'd unlock the true genius of Mr Sholmes's great deduction!
Sholmes:
Precisely the thought that was going through my own mind.
Ryunosuke:
(This man is a lot of work...)
Sholmes:
At times, I wonder how anyone puts up with me! Ah ha ha ha hah!
Ryunosuke:
(It's not that funny...)
Sholmes:
Ah, and you, my good fellow...
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
Take a moment to look at your wrists.
Ryunosuke:
My wrists?
Susato:
Ah! Wh-Where are your handcuffs?
Ryunosuke:
Huh?! How, how did...?
Sholmes:
I felt they may hinder your ability to follow me in our... dance of deduction.
Ryunosuke:
I don't believe it!
Susato:
Mr Sholmes, you are a marvel!
Sholmes:
And don't worry. I shall restore the shackles to your wrists when we are finished.
Ryunosuke:
I'm not worried. In fact, I'd rather stay like this...
Sholmes:
So...let us begin. Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!
Course CorrectionHold it, Mr Sholmes!

Now, we ask ourselves, what could you possibly want with such an implement? The answer, of course, is staring us in the face. You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the copious beard  you sport! 
Susato:
Hm, I'm not sure... Would you really use shears like that to cut off a beard?
Ryunosuke:
I doubt that's something I'll ever have to worry about. It doesn't quite sit right with me, though.
Susato:
It doesn't seem to be sitting right with Mr Roylott, either.
Ryunosuke:
(Which means, I suppose, that the deduction is wrong...)
Susato:
Let's try to switch a key word here, Naruhodo-san, and see if it helps matters.
Ryunosuke:
Alright. But how?
Susato:
I think we should start by taking a long, hard look at Mr Roylott.
Ryunosuke:
I wonder if it's really his beard that he intended to use those shears on...
Susato:
Exactly. If we do manage to find something that seems to fit the sense of Mr Sholmes's deduction better...
Ryunosuke:
Then what?
Susato:
Then I'll leave the rest in your capable hands, Naruhodo-san!
Ryunosuke:
(Why am I the one to do something about this...?) Well anyway, let's see if there's anything we could even use to switch around in that last sentence. What exactly was Mr Roylott really going to use those enormous shears for?
Examine thick hat
Ryunosuke:
It's a very thick hat, isn't it?
Susato:
Ah, that's the secret, you see, Naruhodo-san. Don't you know?
Ryunosuke:
Secret? What?
Susato:
Well, before we left Japan, I took some time to study various foreign countries. Russia is a land of unimaginable cold. And a thick hat is the secret to keeping warm. Without one, I read that your brain would freeze!
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
That was just one of many fascinating snippets of information in 'Oh Mother, Not Russia!'.
Ryunosuke:
...I think maybe you picked the wrong book there.
Examine copious beard
Susato:
It really is a very full beard, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Although according to Mr Sholmes, Mr Roylott was about to cut it off. I still think that he looks nothing like the man pictured in the newspaper article, though. The apparently merciless revolutionary, Vilen Borshevik.
Susato:
So if he wasn't going to cut off his beard... ...presumably he was going to cut something else.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes. We need to look at this from a fresh perspective and try to work out what.)
Examine coat buttons
Susato:
Are you looking at the buttons on this coat?
Ryunosuke:
Could it be that Mr Roylott...was planning to cut these off?!
Susato:
Oh! ...Why?
Ryunosuke:
Well, when you're wearing thick gloves, it can be very hard to undo buttons.
Susato:
Then...couldn't you just take off your gloves first?
Ryunosuke:
Ah-ha! So he was going to use the scissors to cut his gloves off, then!
Susato:
......... I want you to take a deep breath...and look at this from a fresh perspective, Naruhodo-san.
Ryunosuke:
(Oops. I think she's angry...)
Examine golden locks
Ryunosuke:
What the...? What's this?
Susato:
It, it looks like a cascade of stunning, golden locks!
Ryunosuke:
No no no! The colour is not the point. The point is, what's it doing on the back of Mr Roylott's head? And how is it growing out from underneath his thick, black hair?
Susato:
Well yes, that's not true. So it's stunningly beautiful and stunningly surprising.
Ryunosuke:
(Something's definitely not right here...)
Present golden locks
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the golden locks you sport!"
Present thick hat
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
For years, you have been on the run in your homeland. And that hat has never left your head. As a result - almost unbelievably - your thick beard has woven itself inextricably together with your hat. But now you have an itch! Somehow you must reach it. Even if it means cutting the hat off!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the copious beard you sport!"
Present copious beard
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Before you boarded this vessel, you must have suffered a terrible disappointment in love. Now you've vowed to cut off your facial hair to show how you intend to face tomorrow as a new man. Yes, behind that beard is the face of a true romantic!
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.
Ryunosuke:
An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.
Leads to:
"You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the copious beard you sport!"
Present coat buttons
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
For years, you have lived in the icy climate of your homeland, wearing that thick coat for warmth. For so many years, in fact, something terrible has happened: You've forgotten how to undo buttons! Now, in the warmth of this cabin, you find yourself sweltering, and desperate to remove your outer layer!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the copious beard you sport!"
You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the copious beard you sport!
Ryunosuke:
What was this bearded Russian planning to cut off with those enormous shears?
Susato:
If we look carefully enough, perhaps we'll notice something that will give us a clue. We need to approach this from every angle. We must consider all possibilities!
Ryunosuke:
That's easy to say, but alright, let's see if we can work it out. If it wasn't his beard, what WAS the man thinking of cutting?
Ryunosuke:
You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the golden locks you sport!
Sholmes:
...Indeed. You have identified the precise detail I was intending to expose. Such lush, golden hair certainly does not befit an old man.
Roylott:
...!
Ryunosuke:
You're not a man at all! You're a woman! And judging from the length and sheen of your hair...
Sholmes:
...One still very much in her youth!
Roylott:
Oh no... If only I had managed to cut off my hair, no one would have suspected.
Sholmes:
The question then begged is this: Why would you desire to rid yourself of these magnificent locks? Once again, the answer is plain. We have clear evidence to shed light on the matter.
Roylott:
...!
Sholmes:
I'm sure it needs no further clarification. The evidence that reveals your true identity...is the article about the revolutionary!
Ryunosuke:
Well, that was a shock! I had no idea that old man was really a young woman in disguise! Did you?
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
What? Why are you staring at me like that?
Susato:
...Yes, it was a surprise. Naruhodo-san... You're enjoying this, aren't you?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
You look like you're in your element as you dance around the room deducing the facts with Mr Sholmes.
Ryunosuke:
I'm just doing what we agreed. I'm, I'm not having fun or anything! This is strictly business! Not strictly come-
Susato:
Yes, yes, I understand. Say no more.
Ryunosuke:
Well anyway, let's focus on this next part of Mr Sholmes's deduction, shall we? The evidence that he's picked out doesn't fit the facts at all.
Susato:
No, that's true, given that Mr Roylott is actually a woman.
Ryunosuke:
Exactly. He - or rather she - can't possibly be this merciless revolutionary.
Susato:
I suppose it's because the deduction as a whole has taken a different direction now.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...
Susato:
Let's switch the evidence for something else. Something that fits the facts as we now understand them.
Ryunosuke:
(For some reason, this woman needed to try to hide her true identity. I feel as though I've either read or heard about a young woman in a situation like that recently...) Alright, I'll do my best!

No. He isn't even a 'mister'. Under that disguise, 'he' is a young woman.
Ryunosuke:
And I do feel like we have some evidence here somewhere that might reveal who she really is.
Susato:
Let's have another look through all the evidence we've gathered so far and see if we can find it!
Ryunosuke:
The evidence that reveals your true identity is of course...the article about the ballerina!
Sholmes:
That's right. You've hit the nail on the head! 'Renowned Prima Ballerina of the Novavich Ballet Disappears from Shanghai!' It would appear we are finally able to address you by your true name.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, because your true identity is that of the Novavich Ballet's prima ballerina...
Sholmes:
...Miss Nikolina Pavlova!
Roylott:
AAAAAAAAAGH!!! .........
Pavlova:

Kidnapping of a young ballerina
Sholmes:
Now...as for my second conclusion... You are, at this very moment, on the brink of committing a most grievous crime.
Pavlova:
...!
Sholmes:
And the proof of this crime? Over there. Oh yes, Miss Pavlova... Taken unawares, people have a propensity to let their eyes stray, you see.
Pavlova:
Ah!
Sholmes:
And I assure you, the eyes speak so much more eloquently - and honestly - than the mouth. The answer we seek lies where the furtive glance falls. The proof of your crime sits before our very eyes! Yes, that travelling case!
Ryunosuke:
This woman is the ballerina. And she's right in front of our eyes. So clearly she can't be inside that travelling case as well.
Susato:
No, that's right. It seems she wasn't abducted at all.
Ryunosuke:
In which case...what is the crime this young woman is apparently committing? (Haah, I can see I'm going to have to step in and fix the great detective's mistake again...)
Susato:
You seem to look pleased, Naruhodo-san. Do you like the idea of another chance to dance around with Mr Sholmes?
Ryunosuke:
...Stop it. Anyway, there must be something else here that shows what this woman is up to!
Examine travelling case
Ryunosuke:
It's a very small case, isn't it? You can see instantly that no person could possibly fit inside there.
Susato:
So does that tell us... ...that Miss Pavlova's telling glance in this direction was focused on something else?
Ryunosuke:
If that's true, though, it doesn't make sense.
Susato:
What do you mean?
Ryunosuke:
Well, if there's nothing incriminating inside this case... ...why did she refuse to let us look inside?
Susato:
Yes, I wonder why... Perhaps she has a perfectly harmless reason, though.
Examine wastepaper basket
Susato:
The wastepaper basket?
Ryunosuke:
Let's have a little look inside...
Susato:
Naruhodo-san! It's poor etiquette to go sifting through someone's rubbish, you know.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, those eyes... She's looking at me like I'm a piece of rubbish now.)
Susato:
However...these are special circumstances, I think.
Ryunosuke:
Exactly! We have no choice! ......... (There's hardly anything in here at all.)
Susato:
Oh... Well, that's a little disappointing.
Examine tiara
Ryunosuke:
Wow! Look at this dazzling tiara!
Susato:
I've never seen anything like it... Are those real diamonds, do you think? Oh, Naruhodo-san! Try it on!
Ryunosuke:
What?! Me?! Isn't it usually girls who wear tiaras? Wouldn't you like to try it on?
Susato:
Oh no, I couldn't possibly! It's far too beautiful!

The proof of your crime sits before our every eyes! Yes, that travelling case!
Ryunosuke:
Crime comes in so many different forms, that's the thing. How can we be sure...?
Susato:
Mr Sholmes's observational skills are beyond question, Naruhodo-san. Miss Pavlova definitely let her eyes stray to something. And that something will explain everything. We must look around very carefully, and try to work out what she was looking at.
Ryunosuke:
Alright, I'll investigate the area more thoroughly. I agree that there must be something here that will prove what this woman is really guilty of.
Ryunosuke:
The proof of your crime...is surely this tiara!
Pavlova:
Ah!
Sholmes:
I believe this tiara is worn on stage by dancers in the Novavich Ballet, is it not? Indeed, it would appear to be identical to the tiara pictured here in this newspaper article. And if the reporting is to be believed, it's an item worth twenty thousand roubles. In summary...
Ryunosuke:
...The crime you have committed...is theft.
Pavlova:
Oh no!
Sholmes:
Yes, you left your ballet troupe, unlawfully taking their precious tiara with you!
Pavlova:
AAAAAAAAAGH!!! ......... I have no one. No family. No friends. I am all alone. And...I need money! But I did not steal the tiara. It was a present from... How do you say? An earl? ...Of Prussia. It belongs to me!
Ryunosuke:
(This girl is only fifteen years old. And she's run away all by herself. She must have been extremely lonely.)
Pavlova:
......... Alright, I will tell you everything... There is no point to hiding it now.
Sholmes:
Come come, let us not be hasty!
Pavlova:
What?
Sholmes:
There remains one unsolved mystery about you.
Pavlova:
Mystery? Wh-What do you mean?
Sholmes:
You have staunchly refused to open this travelling case of yours in our presence. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that there exists some reason why you wish it to remain closed. Is that not so...Miss Pavlova?
Pavlova:
Um...
Sholmes:
My dear girl, there is no sense in playing games with me. Nothing escapes my attention. Indeed, I have a very good idea of the contents of your case, even before I have ever laid eyes on them. Dear me. We are not well suited to a life of crime, are we? Your careless coup d'oeil betrays you. Once again, we need only follow your furtive glance to find the answer. Yes, the reason why you refuse to open your case...is written in the books on the shelf!
Ryunosuke:
He's completely changed tack with his deduction now!
Susato:
I think Mr Sholmes is adapting his logic to the changing circumstances, don't you?
Ryunosuke:
Maybe, but why has he suddenly brought the bookshelf into all this? It's just a wild guess, surely!
Susato:
Oh... Do you think so?
Ryunosuke:
Well, it doesn't seem likely that the reason why this young woman doesn't want to open her case... ...would have been written in a book that doesn't even belong to her!
Susato:
Yes, that's true. But still... Miss Pavlova certainly did cast her eyes in that direction. I noticed it myself.
Ryunosuke:
Then there has to be another reason why she won't open her case. And it must be somewhere in the same area, if that's where her gaze was involuntarily drawn.
Susato:
I agree. That's the only answer.
Ryunosuke:
(Whatever she has hidden inside that case... ...should be revealed by following her gaze in the direction of the bookcase!)
Examine books on the shelf
Ryunosuke:
Ah... It looks like these are all the same books that we have in our cabin. (I suppose the steward likes to make sure passengers have plenty to read for the long voyage.)
Susato:
And...have you noticed how all the books have fallen over, just like in Kazuma-sama's cabin? It's almost like someone's taken a sweep at them.
Ryunosuke:
Maybe Miss Pavlova? While she was practising her ballet? Anyway, the point is, we don't have time to look through all these books at the moment.
Susato:
We couldn't even if we wanted to. They're all in Russian.
Ryunosuke:
Well, that's a relief. Let's try our luck elsewhere.
Examine small picture
Susato:
This is a charming little picture, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
What is it? Someone climbing a steep mountainside?
Susato:
Or descending one, it seems to me.
Ryunosuke:
(When you've been on the flat sea for a while, maybe you start seeing hills and mountains in everything...)
Examine Rules of Passage
Ryunosuke:
These are the 'Rules of Passage' for travel aboard the SS Burya. 'Passengers must not keep weapons or other dangerous objects in their cabins. Pets are also strictly forbidden.'
Ryunosuke:
There was exactly the same notice in our cabin, too. I wonder what happens if you break the rules?
Susato:
Oh dear! I'm sure the punishment would be severe, Naruhodo-san. You'd probably be left to drift in the freezing-cold ocean... Or shut inside a tiny wardrobe for days on end...
Ryunosuke:
(So I've actually been serving time for weeks now, have I...)
Examine cabin door
Ryunosuke:
It's a metal door, the same as in Kazuma's cabin.
Susato:
Yes, and the rather slim bolt is the same as well.
Ryunosuke:
Well, if Miss Pavlova was actually glancing over at the door here instead of the bookcase... ...that would suggest a desire to run away from this cabin.
Susato:
Hm, maybe...

Ryunosuke:
The way I see it, books are the treasured collection of all human knowledge. There's almost nothing you can't look up in a book. Which means we can probably look up the reason why Miss Pavlova won't open her case in one, too!
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.

Yes, the reason why you refuse to open your case...is written in the books on the shelf!

Surely the reason that Miss Pavlova doesn't want to open her travelling case... ...is because there's something inside that she doesn't want us to see.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it must be what's inside... (Come to think of it... ...we saw the case moving before, didn't we?)
Susato:
I can't imagine what's in there. What could it be?
Ryunosuke:
(What has Miss Pavlova got inside her case? Whatever it is that she is glancing at will probably give us the answer...!) 
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the reason why you refuse to open your case...is written in the Rules of Passage! 'Passengers must not keep weapons or other dangerous objects in their cabins. Pets are also strictly forbidden.'
Sholmes:
Inside that case of yours, is something forbidden from carriage on this vessel. That is the real reason why you refuse to open it, thus revealing its contents.
Pavlova:
I...
Ryunosuke:
As we've seen, the trunk wobbles from time to time. But no weapon or other dangerous item would move of its own accord.
Sholmes:
Which leaves but one possibility, Miss Pavlova... Inside your travelling case... ...is the last item listed as forbidden in the vessel's Rules of Passage: a pet!
Pavlova:
AAAAAAAAAGH!

Ryunosuke:
So clearly, you aren't who you said you were.
Pavlova:
No. I am not Grimesby Roylott. My real name is Nikolina Pavlova. Everything you said was correct.
Sholmes:
You absconded during one of your ballet company's performances in order to escape your homeland. Later that same night, you stole aboard this vessel.
Ryunosuke:
(Which couldn't have been easy. The Burya is a huge steamship with a vast crew. Could she really have snuck on board without being noticed?)
Sholmes:
In order to obscure your true identity, you somewhat recklessly took the guise of an old gentleman. And you intended to sever all links with your past by severing your long hair.
Pavlova:
.........
Sholmes:
Yet to a woman, hair is no trifling matter. My personal recommendation is to leave well alone.
Ryunosuke:
So...if it was just you, about to cut off your own hair... ...who was it that let out the scream we heard from outside the cabin?
Sholmes:
That veritable tinkling of a bell? Why, none other than this young lady, naturally.
Ryunosuke:
(More like a full set of pipes, if you ask me...)
Pavlova:
I was so scared when I ran away in Shanghai. I was sure they would come looking for me. That's why I decided to... How do you say? Disgust myself? So no one would recognise me.
Susato:
As a result, you transformed yourself into that questionable old man? I see...
Pavlova:
I put on the fur hat and...fake beard? Then, just before you came in here, I saw in the newspaper. Right on the page...there was a picture of me. I was so frightened. I couldn't stop from screaming. I knew that if I didn't change my appearances completely, they would find me. So I decided to cut all my hair as fastly as possible. I picked up the scissors in my hand, and...
Sholmes:
...At that precise moment, we walked in through the annoyingly unlocked cabin door.
Susato:
......... Things happen like that sometimes, don't they?
Sholmes:
Things do indeed happen like that from time to time.
Ryunosuke:
(Are those two even talking about the same thing?)
Susato:
There's just one more thing I'd like to know... What exactly do you have inside your travelling case?
Pavlova:
......... You were right. It is my dear friend inside. My only friend in the whole world. Please...don't tell anyone! If the captain finds out... If you say to any of the crew...
Sholmes:
Your secret is safe with us, I assure you. But in return... ...you must tell us, in as much detail as you can muster, about the events of last night.
Pavlova:
...Yes, alright. I will tell you.
Susato:
Well, Mr Naruhodo...? Wasn't it something, Mr Sholmes's great deduction?!
Ryunosuke:
It was certainly something, yes. I'm just not entirely sure what... But at least Miss Pavlova has agreed to tell us what she knows. That's incredible!
Sholmes:
Indeed! It IS incredible! Ah, and one more thing...
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes? What?
Sholmes:
Observe your wrists.
Ryunosuke:
My...?
Susato:
Ah! Your hands...are cuffed again!
Ryunosuke:
WHAT?! But, but how...?
Sholmes:
True to my word, I have restored your shackles.
Ryunosuke:
Grrr... (When? And why?!)
Susato:
There is still a shadow of guilt cast over you, Mr Naruhodo. I'm sorry to say...it can't be helped at the moment.
Ryunosuke:
Haah... (Can't it? Really?)
Susato:
Anyway, let's listen to what Miss Pavlova has to say. I can't go on not knowing... I have to find out what the 'speckled band' that Kazuma-sama wrote about in his diary really was!
Examine
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Let me see...
Pavlova:
Don't touch!
Ryunosuke:
Huh?
Pavlova:
I will tell you what I know about last night. But please... ...you must not touch my things. I... How do you say? ...Forbid it!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, sorry...
Sholmes:
As well you should be, young man. What vulgar manners you have! Poking around in a young lady's private belongings? Neither shall I allow it!
Ryunosuke:
(Grrr... Hypocrite!)

What happened last night
Ryunosuke:
Did you know that someone was killed in the cabin next door to this one last night?
Pavlova:
...One of the crewmen told me this morning when I was eating breakfast.
Ryunosuke:
The man who died... He was a friend of mine.
Pavlova:
...! Oh...
Ryunosuke:
That's why we're trying to find out what happened. Did you...notice anything unusual last night?
Susato:
Perhaps you heard a strange noise, for example? Perhaps people talking?
Sholmes:
Perhaps the ship was absorbed in a wild tempest? Perhaps its steam engine exploded?
Ryunosuke:
...Perhaps everyone on board would have noticed if that had happened?
Susato:
Miss Pavlova? Is there anything you can tell us?
Pavlova:
......... I don't know. I'm sorry, but all I could think about last night was what I had done and whether they would find me. I didn't notice anything that was happening around me.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see...
Running away
Ryunosuke:
You've run away from your ballet company, haven't you? The Novavich Ballet?
Pavlova:
...Yes. I am travelling to Great Britain, and from there... I want to go to America. I will never dance again. I want to forget everything about the ballet. ...I will start a new life.
Sholmes:
You wish to forget? A challenging proposition...when you have that striking tiara as a reminder.
Pavlova:
But the tiara is mine! I need it to live! ......... I have no money of my own. The Novavich Ballet gives us only a little food and water. And we must dance all over the world. I had to run away! I had no choice! ...If I stayed, it would have killed me.
Susato:
So you ran away to protect yourself?
Pavlova:
Yes. And the crew of this ship, they have all been kind to me. They let me come on board, and they said I could hide in this cabin.
Sholmes:
......... If that is indeed the truth, Miss Pavlova... ...it creates a most intriguing conundrum.
Susato:
Yes...it does. What do you think about it, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Me? Oh, well...yes... Of course... ...I think we should hear Miss Pavlova's explanation! (To what 'conundrum', I'm not sure, but...)
Conundrum (appears after "Running away")
Sholmes:
Miss Pavlova, allow me to pose you a riddle.
Pavlova:
.........
Sholmes:
According to this newspaper, it was only yesterday that you absconded from the ballet. Now, that being the case... ...it must have been last night that you boarded this vessel.
Pavlova:
.........
Sholmes:
However... ...the SS Burya stopped by no port last night.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! That's it! Of course!
Sholmes:
So how is it, pray, that you come to be aboard?
Pavlova:
.........
Susato:
Now that I think about it, the crewman outside the cabin acted very strangely when we mentioned that. It was just after we asked him about when the occupant of this cabin came aboard...
Strogenov:
......... That is not your business.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, you're right. He did seem to be hiding something.
Pavlova:
......... ......... 'An angel descended from the heavens, bringing grace and beauty to the stage.'
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? What was that?
Pavlova:
It is how the Russian newspapers described one of my performances. And that is how I came here, too. I descended from the heavens. Because I am an angel.
Ryunosuke:
......... Considering English isn't your mother tongue, your description is very vivid.
Susato:
Mr Sholmes once said, 'I never can resist a touch of the dramatic.' It seems Miss Pavlova is the same.
Sholmes:
'A genius descended from the heavens, bringing grace and beauty to detection!' ...Words once said about myself. A quote from a wonderfully extravagant advertisement for 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' in fact!
Ryunosuke:
(Yes yes, Mr Showy... Anyway, it doesn't look like Miss Pavlova is going to tell us what really happened...)
'Friend'
Ryunosuke:
So the 'friend' you mentioned is inside your travelling case, is that right?
Susato:
I don't think animals are allowed on board, according to the Rules of Passage.
Pavlova:
Oh please! Don't tell! Don't tell any of the crew! If they found my precious...
Sholmes:
...Then the burly Russians would bestir themselves in unison to throw you and your case overboard, no doubt.
Pavlova:
AAAAAAGH!
Ryunosuke:
(So reassuring, Mr Sholmes...)
Susato:
But what sort of pet is your friend? A little puppy? ...It is, isn't it?!
Pavlova:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Maybe an adorable little rabbit?
Pavlova:
.........
Sholmes:
Hah! You credit Russia as a land with small rabbits, do you?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Don't they have small rabbits there, then?
Sholmes:
You may well ask. I have no idea!
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Sholmes:
You two are miserable bunglers when it comes to understanding the nature of young ballerinas' friends! Isn't it obvious? It must be a chicken!
Susato:
Really?!
Sholmes:
Consider the benefits: A rousing wake-up call, daily fresh eggs... ...and when adversity strikes, it could satisfy the needs of sustenance.
Ryunosuke:
...So you'd eat your friends. I'll remember that.
Pavlova:
.........
Sholmes:
Well, it would appear this friend's identity is a closely guarded secret not to be revealed! Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
Ryunosuke:
(She obviously doesn't quite trust us yet.)
If Kazuma's Diary has not been presented yet
Ryunosuke:
(There's something I should like to show her, I think. Maybe she might be able to shed some light on it.)
Present
University Collar Pin
Ryunosuke:
Um, can I show you this? I'm actually a university student from the Empire of Japan, you see.
Pavlova:
......... That means nothing to me.
Ryunosuke:
(No, why would it?)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo... If you're determined to flaunt your Yumei badge, at least choose a Japanese person who might recognise it.
Ryunosuke:
......... Miss Susato, can I show you this?
Susato:
...Maybe later.
Ryunosuke:
(Ooh, I could show Inspector Hosonaga, too!)
Article About Revolutionary
Ryunosuke:
Miss Pavlova, about this article... Did you know about this merciless revolutionary already?
Pavlova:
No. But when I saw the picture, I couldn't believe it! He looked just like me in my disguise!
Ryunosuke:
Huh? (Am I the only one around here with eyes?)
Pavlova:
The other man - the one wearing the brown - he also said so. He said we looked the same.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, he says a lot of things. But I have a strong feeling that besides you and the 'great' detective... ...you won't find another soul on this ocean who thinks there's any similarity there at all.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! I won't allow you to speak ill of Mr Sholmes!
Ryunosuke:
No no! I wouldn't dream of it!
Article About Ballerina
Ryunosuke:
Miss Pavlova, about this article...
Susato:
You look so beautiful! Like a fairy!
Pavlova:
......... I'm scared. If my picture is in the newspapers...
Susato:
You poor girl...
Ryunosuke:
(She's so young. Just fifteen years old. For her to have run away all by herself... ...she must have felt very, very alone.)
Kazuma's Diary
Ryunosuke:
This is the diary of my friend who passed away.
Pavlova:
His diary?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, and he wrote in it last night before he died. Something a little unusual. It reads: '1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint whistling sound.' And then a few minutes later: '1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.'
Pavlova:
A speckled band? I...don't understand...
Ryunosuke:
It's strange, isn't it? But the ventilator he mentions joins to this cabin, you see. It's up there on the wall.
Susato:
In other words, this cabin and the victim's cabin are connected together.
Pavlova:
Oh!
Susato:
Miss Pavlova...? Has something occurred to you? Does the speckled band the victim mentioned mean something to you? Or the whistling sound, perhaps?
Pavlova:
......... No. I don't know anything.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Pavlova:
.........
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Miss Pavlova...would  you take a look at this?
Pavlova:
......... I don't know. I don't know anything!
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! You're frightening the poor girl!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Sorry... (I wasn't trying to.)
After clearing all Converse options and presenting Kazuma's Diary:
*Knock knock*
Strogenov:
Excuse me! Mr Roylott...
Roylott:
Yes? What?
Ryunosuke:
(Wow, she's fast!)
Strogenov:
Captain would like to speak with you. You must come to captain's quarters at once! ...Please.
Roylott:
Alright. I will come now. .........
Ryunosuke:
What?
Roylott:
You must leave. Now.
Ryunosuke:
Oh no, it's fine. Don't mind us.
Susato:
Yes, please don't worry yourself, Mr Roylott.
Roylott:
GET OUT!!!
Strogenov:
The passenger said, 'OUT'! Or you want me to throw you out?!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... It looks like we'll have to leave investigating this cabin until later.)
Susato:
What a pity.
And so we lost our chance. Having still not managed to investigate Miss Pavlova's cabin, we were unceremoniously chased out. That is to say...we were quite literally picked up and thrown into the passageway outside.
To be continued...
First-Class Passageway (before Bif Strogenov enters the cabin):
Examine
Cabin door on right
Ryunosuke:
'First-Class Cabin No. 2'... Home for this voyage - at least to Mr Grimesby Roylott, the gentleman we just met.
Susato:
These cabins are the finest on the ship. Mr Roylott must be a man of considerable standing. .........
Ryunosuke:
I suppose so...compared to a nobody like me who doesn't even have a passport, or ticket.
Susato:
I, I meant no disrespect, Naruhodo-san!
9th January
SS Burya, First-Class Cabin Passageway
Susato:
I wish we hadn't been thrown out like that.
Ryunosuke:
I wish we'd managed to find some clue as to what that 'speckled band' might be.
Susato:
We didn't manage to investigate at all. And I imagine... ...that we won't be able to for a while longer. We'll never get past that sailor guarding the door.
Ryunosuke:
(He's clearly glaring at us, as if to say, 'Don't even think about it!') Oh! Wait a minute!
Susato:
What is it?
Ryunosuke:
Well, what happened to our great detective friend? Where did he go?
Susato:
Oh yes! He's completely disappeared!
Ryunosuke:
When did he do that? (He's slipped away as quietly as the wind. But not before ensuring these were securely back on my wrists...)
Examine
Bif Strogenov
Ryunosuke:
(I really wish we'd had a chance to look around in Miss Pavlova's cabin.)
Strogenov:
......... What? Why you look like that? You want something?
Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Strogenov:
Maybe...you want me to throw you out again, hm?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! No no! Definitely not that!
Strogenov:
Next time I have to throw you out, I show you where lobsters spend winter! Understand?
Ryunosuke:
U-Understand! (Maybe I should steer clear of him until he's forgotten my face...)
Susato:
I don't think he'll ever forget your face, Naruhodo-san.
Cabin door on left
Ryunosuke:
'First-Class Cabin No. 1'... Yes, that's our cabin.
Susato:
Not 'our' cabin. It's Kazuma-sama's.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
Your accommodation is confined to the wardrobe inside the cabin.
Ryunosuke:
You know how to make a stowaway feel small, don't you? As small as the wardrobe I've been calling home. Anyway... ...I wonder if Inspector Hosonaga has managed to uncover any new clues.
Susato:
Yes, we should probably find him and ask.
Blue door
Susato:
That door leads to the second-class area.
Ryunosuke:
......... It's locked. I can't open it.
Susato:
No, well, that stands to reason. No one wants to let the murderer escape.
Ryunosuke:
(Gosh, she gave me a very stern look when she said that!)
9th January
SS Burya, First-Class Cabin No. 1
Ryunosuke:
It looks like they're still investigating in here.
Susato:
Yes. On that subject... ...I wonder if Inspector Hosonaga is unscathed.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean, 'unscathed'?
Susato:
Surely you haven't forgotten, have you, Naruhodo-san? Don't you remember what he said about allowing you out of this cabin to investigate? He was going to talk to the captain about it. He said he'd lay his life on the line for you!
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes. But I'm sure he was exaggerating. Let's see what he has to say for himself. (He might have some new information for us... You never know.)
Examine
Satoru Hosonaga
Hosonaga:
Ah, you're back.
Ryunosuke:
In-Inspector!
Susato:
What happened to you?! Your face is...!
Hosonaga:
Please, don't worry about it. They're just scratches.
Ryunosuke:
(Made by a bear, maybe!)
Hosonaga:
When I told the captain that I'd given you permission to investigate... ...he told me he'd pummel me with his fists and then toss me overboard.
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Hosonaga:
But the pummelling was over in a flash, and he must have decided against throwing me overboard. So it was nothing, really.
Ryunosuke:
(It looks like he wasn't joking when he said he'd lay his life on the line if he had to...)
Susato:
Well, thanks to your efforts, we now know a little about the neighbouring cabin.
Hosonaga:
Yes, so I understand.
Susato:
Oh!
Hosonaga:
I bumped into a man claiming to be a great detective a little while ago. I think his name was something like 'Herr Lock Sholmes'. I don't think he was German, though...
Ryunosuke:
(Ah, that explains it.) Shall we compare notes, then? We can tell you what we've found out.
Hosonaga:
Yes, let's do it!
The cabin next door
Hosonaga:
...What?! Nikolina Pavlova?! She's in the cabin next door?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, do you know who she is?
Hosonaga:
Please! What self-respecting ballet fan wouldn't know that graceful angel? Ahem! ...Ahem, ahem! AHEEEMMM!!!
Ryunosuke:
(Oops, I think I upset him there...)
Hosonaga:
Well, that tells us the neighbouring cabin is unrelated to the case at least.
Ryunosuke:
Oh? How?
Hosonaga:
Because angels don't go around committing crimes, do they?
Ryunosuke:
(Oops, now I've definitely upset him!)
Susato:
Inspector, has your investigation in here proved fruitful?
Hosonaga:
If I'm honest, there's very little more I can do. Our duty is to make sure the scene isn't disturbed, ready to hand over to the Hong Kong police. So I'm just keeping watch here. Trying not to take my eyes off the job.
Susato:
Oh, I see...
Hosonaga:
Ah, there is one thing. I do have a small piece of new information for you.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! What?
Susato:
Yes, do tell us, Inspector! Please!
New information (appears after "The cabin next door")
Ryunosuke:
What is this new information you have, Inspector?
Hosonaga:
It's this. The Burya's medical officer has finished his examination of the body. I managed to obtain the report.
Ryunosuke:
Oh... Kazuma's post-mortem report?
Susato:
Kazuma-sama...
Ryunosuke:
So...what was the cause of death?
Hosonaga:
'Damage to the cervical vertebrae', is what's written in the report.
Susato:
His...neck was broken?
Hosonaga:
Yes, it would seem so. There were no obvious wounds or other signs of injury. So at first, I think they were considering poison. But it turns out they found no trace of poison in his system at all.
Ryunosuke:
Well...what weapon was used, then?
Hosonaga:
Nothing has been found as yet. But the fact that there are no signs of a wound... ...suggest it may have been a blunt object. Something that wouldn't leave a mark.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see...
Susato:
All the body's nerves run through the spine to the brain. A strong enough impact to the neck could induce death. It is a possibility. And no obvious wound would be left.
Ryunosuke:
(Poor Kazuma...)
Hosonaga:
I have a second copy of the report. If it might be useful, you're welcome to have it.
Ryunosuke:
Really? Are you sure?
Hosonaga:
Yes, it's fine. I trust you.
Susato:
...!
Hosonaga:
After all, if I didn't trust you... ...I'd never have agreed to you leaving this cabin in the first place, would I?
Ryunosuke:
Ah...
Susato:
.........
The post-mortem report has been entered into the Court Record.
New information (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
What is this new information you have, Inspector?
Hosonaga:
It's this. The Burya's medical officer has finished his examination of the body. I managed to obtain the report.
Ryunosuke:
Oh... Kazuma's post-mortem report?
Susato:
Kazuma-sama...
Ryunosuke:

Ryunosuke:
(Poor Kazuma...)
The great detective
Susato:
Oh! Mr Sholmes was here, was he?
Hosonaga:
Yes, he seemed to be enjoying himself a little too much as he crept about on the floor investigating. But then he suddenly left. I suppose he must have become bored.
Ryunosuke:
Did he say anything at all?
Hosonaga:
Actually, now you mention it, yes... Just one thing, but he practically shouted it. 'It's shoe polish!' ...was all he said.
Ryunosuke:
Shoe polish? ...I wonder what he meant.
Hosonaga:
It was when he was over there. By the piece of broken glass. Do you see?
Susato:
Ah, perhaps he was talking about this brick-coloured mark, do you think?
Hosonaga:
Ah...yes! That must be it!
Ryunosuke:
But how could Mr Sholmes know that it's shoe polish?
Hosonaga:
Hm... That leaves me cold, I'm afraid. I have no idea.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
What is it, Susato-san?
Susato:
Well... ...Kazuma-sama was wearing leather shoes with a very dark tan hue.
Ryunosuke:
Dark tan...? (A sort of dark brownish-red then...)
Susato:
Yes, a little like the colour of red wine, but darker. I often repaired them for him.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Does this mean...? (...that this mark was made by the polish on Kazuma's shoes as they scuffed on the floor?)
The mark on the floor has been entered into the Court Record.

Sailor in front of shelf
Ryunosuke:
Erm...
Sailor:
You! Where did you go?!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Sorry! I, I just went to the next-door cabin to investiga-
Sailor:
Why?! Who gave you permission for this?!
Ryunosuke:
Um, well, Inspe- I mean, Seaman Hosonaga did.
Sailor:
Hmph. That new Japanese, was it? Later, I will roll him into ball and throw him in cold room!
Ryunosuke:
(Whew, he's gone back to guarding the door.)
Susato:
I hope Inspector Hosonaga doesn't find himself in too much trouble on our account.
Ryunosuke:
He's really gone out of his way to help us, hasn't he? When we get back to Japan, we'll have to take him for a steak at La Carneval.
Susato:
That could be a very long time from now, Naruhodo-san.
Shelf
Ryunosuke:
All the books provided for passengers occupying this cabin, neatly arranged on the shelf.
Susato:
They were all over the place when we first looked around, if you remember.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes. And you tidied them up, didn't you?
Susato:
You have to look after the ship's property! Unruly behaviour in the cabins leads to damage.
Ryunosuke:
But it really wasn't me who knocked them over.
Susato:
Well anyway, I feel much better now they're neatly lined up. I can't relax when things are untidy.
Sign
Ryunosuke:
These are the 'Rules of Passage' for travel aboard the SS Burya.
Susato:
'Passengers must not keep weapons or other dangerous objects in their cabins. Pets are also strictly forbidden.'
Ryunosuke:
So by bringing her pet on board, Miss Pavlova has broken the rules.
Susato:
She called it her 'friend', didn't she?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Although we don't know what form this 'friend' takes as yet.
Susato:
I'm almost certain that whatever it is, it's inside the travelling case in her cabin.
Ryunosuke:
(Hm... A 'friend'... There's more to this than it seems, I think...)
Writing on floor or body outline
Ryunosuke:
So it's clear that these letters were written with the ink that was somehow spilt on the floor. And they spell the Russian word for 'wardrobe'.
Susato:
It does seem to be an unambiguous pointer to you, Naruhodo-san, as you were sleeping in there.
Ryunosuke:
But to be truly unambiguous, it should have just spelt out my name, don't you think?
Susato:
Well, either way, one fact remains... It's hard to imagine that Kazuma-sama would have written his last words - or word - in Russian.
Ryunosuke:
(Which begs the question of who did write it?)
Desk
Ryunosuke:
This is where Kazuma spent his final moments, writing his diary.
Susato:
'1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint whistling sound. 1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.'
Ryunosuke:
(Looking at his writing here on this page... ...it's almost impossible to believe that he's gone.)
Susato:
Kazuma-sama left us a valuable clue in these words, I'm sure of it. We have to solve this mystery, Naruhodo-san!
Ryunosuke:
We will!
Vent
Ryunosuke:
So this ventilator joins to Miss Pavlova's cabin.
Susato:
Yes, that's right.
Ryunosuke:
And just a few minutes before he died, Kazuma saw something emerging from it. The 'speckled band', as he described it.
Susato:
If only Miss Pavlova had been able to shed some light on it. But she seemed as baffled as we are.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. ...I wonder if she's telling us everything, though.
Susato:
I'm not sure.
Ryunosuke:
(I know most people aboard would say the same about me, but... ...there was something about that woman that didn't sit right with me.)
Susato:
.........
After clearing all Converse options with Satoru Hosonaga:
Hosonaga:
That's really all I can tell you at this stage. I should return to my post. My fellow crewman's eyes are boring into the back of my head.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that might be for the best. Thank you.
Hosonaga:
Ahem! ...Ahem, ahem!
Susato:
Poor Inspector... You look exhausted.
Hosonaga:
Oh... No. Well... ...I feel terrible that I failed to protect Asogi-san. He was my responsibility.
Susato:
.........
Hosonaga:
Of course, my pain is nothing compared to yours. You were his friends. The truth is... ...I seem to have had a heavy head ever since I woke this morning.
Ryunosuke:
A heavy head...? (That's interesting... My head's still throbbing, too.) 
Examine
Broken glass or floor mark
Susato:
It really is such a beautiful colour, this glass.
Ryunosuke:
It looks like whatever it was has broken clean in two. But the other half is nowhere to be seen.
Susato:
And then there's the brick-coloured mark.
Ryunosuke:
Which is shoe polish, according to that great detective you seem to know all about.
Susato:
I suppose it must be from Kazuma-sama's shoes.
Ryunosuke:
Maybe. But what I'd like to know is... ...how can the detective be so sure that it's shoe polish and not something else?
Susato:
Because he's a great detective, of course!
Ryunosuke:
...That's hardly a reason, is it?
9th January
SS Burya, First-Class Cabin Passageway
Susato:
Ah! Look, Naruhodo-san! Seaman Strogenov has gone!
Ryunosuke:
Strong...enough...?
Susato:
The burly Russian sailor who's always crossing his arms and glaring at us!
Ryunosuke:
Ugh, all these Russian names are impossible to remember...
......... ...Tra-la-la...
Ryunosuke:
Did you hear that? (It sounded like someone singing...)
Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay...I did it the great deteeective way...
Susato:
This carolling... ...I know that lark-like voice.
Ryunosuke:
Well, never mind that now. This is a golden opportunity for us.
Susato:
Yes, you're right! We must seize it! Let's get inside Miss Pavlova's cabin while we can and investigate!
Ryunosuke:
Definitely. Before that 'Stringy-knot' crewman comes back!
Susato:
It's Strogenov, not 'Stringy-knot'!
Examine
Cabin door on right
Ryunosuke:
Miss Pavlova's cabin...
Susato:
......... This could be our chance.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Susato:
The burly sailor doesn't appear to be around at the moment. We could investigate every last inch of that cabin!
Ryunosuke:
...I'm not sure if we could go that far. (But we could certainly do with looking around more. I'm sure we could learn something!)
Herlock Sholmes
Leads to:
"Oh! It's Mr Sholmes, look!"
Susato:
Oh! It's Mr Sholmes, look!
Ryunosuke:
Wow, you never know where he's going to turn up next, do you?
Susato:
He seems to be stealing a look at something as he sings to himself!
Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay... I did it the great deteeective way...
Ryunosuke:
He's still singing. Do you think he hasn't noticed us?
Susato:
Or he's simply in extremely high spirits.
...Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew... ...When the Yard bit off more than it could chew... ...And through it all, when there was doubt... ...It's lucky Herlock was about...
Ryunosuke:
Um, excuse me...
...I solved it all and I stood tall... ...I did it the great deteeective way...
Ryunosuke:
MR SHOLMES!!!
Sholmes:
AAAAAAAAAGH!!! ...What is it? You want to fight? Hm? Honestly! Interrupting a fellow when he's singing! And I was just about to reach the climactic finish!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry, I thought you were never going to stop, so I figured now is as good a time as any.
Sholmes:
I very nearly dropped you to the floor with one of my famous right hooks!
Ryunosuke:
...Alright, I get the picture. Now could you put those fists away?
Susato:
Mr Sholmes... ...you seemed to be examining something before we interrupted you.
Sholmes:
Ah, yes. That. I was immersed in study of the ship's log, as penned by the stockily-built crewman who's usually on guard here.
Susato:
Oh yes, the ship's log.
Ryunosuke:
And did you find out anything useful from it?
Sholmes:
Well, after 2 a.m. this morning, the majority of the entries are blank.
Ryunosuke:
Which means that there was nothing to report. Nothing of note happened, so-
Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha hah! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha hah! You truly are a student from the Land of the Rising Sun! You've been utterly blinded by it! Ah ha ha!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
Your logic, my boys, is inverted.
Susato:
Whatever do you mean, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Observe the other pages, and all shall become clear. It would seem the same crewman oft stands sentry in this first-class passageway. And he has an almost religious practice of recording 'Nothing to report' every half hour.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, he writes that in every thirty minutes?
Susato:
Nothing to report...?
Sholmes:
Precisely! Put simply, the seaman writes 'Nothing to report' when there is just that. And yet...
Ryunosuke:
...The ship's log from last night is largely blank. He didn't even write 'Nothing to report'...
Susato:
Do you mean...?
Sholmes:
Yes. There were circumstances afoot last night, which led to the seaman being absent from his post.
Susato:
What kind of circumstances? What happened?!
Sholmes:
That remains a mystery for now. But we can be sure something significant took place. So significant, that it caused the seaman to forget his regular habit of scribing 'Nothing to report' in the log. These are important details. I would stake my life on it! You must log the ship's log in your mental file!
The ship's log has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
(Now THAT deduction was worthy of a great detective.)
Sholmes:
Ah, you're starting to understand what 'my way' is, I see. What makes Sholmes 'Sholmes'. ...Brilliance! Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Hah ha ha ha ha...hah. ...Ooh. Ouch.
Ryunosuke:
What is it? Are you hurt?
Sholmes:
Oh, don't worry yourself. I seem to be afflicted with a throbbing head this morning for some reason, nothing more.
Susato:
...!
Sholmes:
Well, my friends... Until our next encounter!
Ryunosuke:
(He's still singing to himself. I can hear it as he wanders off down the passageway.)
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Is something wrong, Susato-san? You seem lost in thought.
Susato:
It's just... Well, I feel the same.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
Ever since I woke this morning, I've had something of a headache. A sort of...continuous throbbing.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! You too?
Susato:
.........
9th January
SS Burya, First-Class Cabin No. 2
Ryunosuke:
(Miss Pavlova isn't back yet.) Susato-san... Oh! (Where's she gone?) Hey! What are you doing?! Those are her private things...
Susato:
There's not a moment to waste, Naruhodo-san! We must investigate as quickly as we can!
Ryunosuke:
...I suppose you're right. For Kazuma's sake.
Susato:
......... Not just for Kazuma-sama.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Susato:
It can't be long now until we arrive at port. In Hong Kong. I...don't want you to be in those handcuffs when we get there.
Ryunosuke:
R-Really...?
Susato:
We must solve this case, Naruhodo-san! By ourselves if we have to!
Ryunosuke:
......... Yes, we will!
Examine
Door
Ryunosuke:
This cabin door has the same simple sort of bolted latch that our cabin door has. If the bolt's drawn across, there's no way anybody could enter the cabin from outside.
Susato:
Yes, it's not a particularly heavy-duty bolt, is it? But still, it wouldn't slide across of its own accord, would it?
Ryunosuke:
No, and the door is made of metal, so there's no chance of trickery using magnets to unbolt it from the outside.
Susato:
And it seals up perfectly, too. To stop any seawater coming in. So you couldn't use the method you told me of passing a thread through a crack around the closed door, either.
Ryunosuke:
(...I seem to know a lot of tricks for opening doors. I'm starting to see why they suspect me...)
Sign
Ryunosuke:
Ah yes, they're displayed in this cabin too, look. The SS Burya's 'Rules of Passage'. 'Passengers must not keep weapons or other dangerous objects in their cabins. Pets are also strictly forbidden.'
Susato:
I suppose Miss Pavlova realised that she needed to keep the contents of her case a secret after she read this. Her special 'friend', I mean.
Ryunosuke:
I wonder where her friend has disappeared to now. It's probably having fun exploring the ship, I imagine.
Susato:
I just hope Seaman Strogenov doesn't find it and throw it overboard.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes...so do I.
Shelf
Ryunosuke:
All the books have toppled over together, look. Every single one.
Susato:
Do you think that's a god of the sea, perhaps? He's toppled too, though.
Ryunosuke:
It's exactly the same as the bookcase next door. In Kazuma's cabin.
Susato:
Perhaps... Perhaps Miss Pavlova was practising a difficult ballet pose and fell against the bookcase?
Ryunosuke:
I don't know... Would she really be practising ballet on the same night she ran away from her ballet company?
Susato:
Alright then... ...it must have been you. You lost your temper and knocked them all over in a fit of rage?
Ryunosuke:
...Not everything bad that happens on this ship is because of me, you know.
Susato:
Well anyway. I'll set them all straight again in here, too. I don't like seeing things in disarray.
Shelf (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
All the books provided for passengers occupying this cabin, now neatly arranged on the shelf.
Susato:
Yes, it's very unthinking to dance around inside the cabins.
Ryunosuke:
Tell that to Miss Pavlova, not me!
Susato:
Well anyway, I feel much better now they're neatly lined up. I can't relax when things are untidy.
Wardrobe
Susato:
Naruhodo-san! Are you there?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? I'm right here, yes. Why?
Susato:
Oh, good. I thought you might have climbed into the wardrobe when I wasn't looking. There's no place like home.
Ryunosuke:
...Believe me, I don't have some strange compulsion to jump inside every wardrobe I see, you know.
Susato:
Well anyway, I'm not sure anyone could fit inside this one. It's full of beautiful outfits. I suppose they're all stage costumes.
Ryunosuke:
Hm... I was rather hoping we might find Miss Pavlova's 'friend' hiding in there, but no such luck.
Vent
Ryunosuke:
So this ventilator connects to Kazuma's cabin next door.
Susato:
Yes. Although what a fool a shipbuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Maybe... ...it's so that if there's a gas leak next door, the occupant of this cabin would notice and raise the alarm!
Susato:
Or...the occupants of both cabins would die of gas poisoning.
Ryunosuke:
Hm...that is a possibility. (Anyway, last night, Kazuma wrote that he saw a 'speckled band' coming out of this ventilator.)
Susato:
.........
Bell cord
Ryunosuke:
There's one of these next to the bed in Kazuma's cabin, too.
Susato:
Yes, it's a bell cord. ...I can't resist!
Ryunosuke:
(She barely hesitated there. And she gave it a good tug, too!)
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
No, I didn't actually expect anyone to come...
Ryunosuke:
We don't want them to! We're trying to investigate in secret!
Suitcase
Susato:
Oh my! Miss Pavlova's case is open!
Ryunosuke:
...It's completely empty inside. But according to the great detective's 'great deduction'... ...she was hiding her special friend in there.
Susato:
Yes. A friend that she had to keep secret.
Ryunosuke:
Because you're not allowed to bring animals aboard the SS Burya. (I wonder what kind of animal she had in there. And more to the point... ...where is it now?!)
Desk
Ryunosuke:
There are just a few books on the desk. Nothing else, by the looks of it.
Susato:
Well, Miss Pavlova only ran away from the ballet last night. She's hardly occupied this cabin for any time at all.
Ryunosuke:
That's true. I wonder what kind of books she likes to read...
Susato:
Hm, let me see... Yes... Yes, I see... It would seem that Miss Pavlova enjoys reading... ...books written in Russian.
Ryunosuke:
Thanks. I think I probably already knew that.
Susato:
It's rude to ask too much of people, Naruhodo-san. Kindly remember that!
Wastebasket
Susato:
I suppose every cabin has a wastepaper basket.
Ryunosuke:
Should we have a little look and see what's been thrown away?
Susato:
Naruhodo-san! It's poor etiquette to go sifting through someone's rubbish, you know.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, those eyes... She's looking at me like I'm a piece of rubbish now.)
Susato:
However...these are special circumstances, I think.
Ryunosuke:
Exactly! We have no choice! ......... (There's hardly anything in here at all.)
Susato:
Oh... Well, that's a little disappointing.
Plate
Susato:
I wonder what this little saucer is doing on the floor...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it doesn't look like it's been dropped... More like it was put there deliberately.
Susato:
Ah! Do you think...? Do you think there could be a leak in the roof just above here?
Ryunosuke:
What? A leak?!
Susato:
Is this ship quite safe?
Ryunosuke:
I'm, I'm sure that even if there's a little leak in the roof, it doesn't mean the whole ship is going to sink.
Susato:
No... No, you're right. Of course you're right!
Ryunosuke:
(She's really trying to persuade herself, isn't she?)
Teapot
Susato:
...It would seem this teapot is empty.
Ryunosuke:
Hm... So the natural conclusion is that the Russians are a very thirsty people.
Susato:
Or...because Miss Pavlova only came into this cabin last night, she hasn't had the chance to make any tea yet? ...I mean, it could be either.
Ryunosuke:
......... It's definitely that they're excessively thirsty. I'd lay a thousand to one on it!
Susato:
...You're rather obstinate, aren't you, Naruhodo-san?
After examining shelf, vent, suitcase in Nikolina Pavlova's cabin and Herlock Sholmes in passageway:
Ding-aling-aling-aling-aling-aling-aling...
Susato:
Agh! What's that?!
Whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiir! Whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiir!
Shut down the engines immediately! Vessel sighted a quarter mile fore! Full stop! Hard to starboard! All hands, brace for impact!
Ryunosuke:
What the...?
Susato:
I think we're about to crash into another ship...
Ryunosuke:
WHAT?!
Susato:
I, I can't stand...
Ryunosuke:
Susato-san! Hold on to me! WAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
Ryunosuke:
Susato-san! Are you alright? Are you injured at all?
Susato:
I, I think I'm fine. Thank you, Naruhodo-san.
Ryunosuke:
It looks like we avoided a collision...
Susato:
I think...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the ship has come to a stop.
Susato:
Oh my goodness, what about you, Naruhodo-san? Are you hurt?
Ryunosuke:
No...I'm fine.
???:
Hello! Is anybody in there? Shout if you need assistance!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, that sounds like...
Susato:
...Inspector Hosonaga.
Hosonaga:
Is that you in there, Naruhodo-san? Unbolt the door! Quickly!
Ryunosuke:
What? The bolt...?
Susato:
Look at that!
Ryunosuke:
The door's bolted! Did you do that, Susato-san?
Susato:
No! I didn't touch it.
Ryunosuke:
Well that's strange. How did...? (And look at all the books. They're just like they were before again.)
Susato:
Naruhodo-san, aren't you going to open the door and let the inspector in?
Ryunosuke:
(I'd better tidy this place up first...)
Our violent emergency stop had solved one mystery at least, in a very vivid way. But I knew that what awaited us on the other side of the cabin door would not be pleasant. I hurried around tidying up the cabin with a new sense of foreboding in my heart...
To be continued...
9th January
SS Burya, Miss Pavlova's Cabin
Somehow, the door to the cabin we were in ended up bolted after we made an emergency stop. Susato-san took a deep breath, then gently slid back the bolt...
Strogenov:
You! What are you doing in Miss Pavlova's quarters?!
Hosonaga:
Ah, you both look unhurt. Good.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, we're fine, thank you. What on earth happened? We heard something about how we were going to collide with another ship!
Hosonaga:
Yes. It appears to have been a false report, though.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, how did that happen?
Hosonaga:
There's a dense fog outside, so it's extremely difficult to see. Someone must have thought he saw a ship ahead. This person obviously triggered the alarm and that's why we made an emergency stop.
Strogenov:
Everything is chaos! Passengers are screaming! Crew are running everywhere!
Hosonaga:
This first-class area is the only quiet part of the ship at the moment.
Susato:
Oh, I see.
Ryunosuke:
(Someone triggered the alarm? Does that mean...? ...that someone pressed that button outside?)
Pavlova:
AAAAAAGH!!! You...you wicked intruder! Dressed all in black! You are the devil!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? Me? (I've been called a lot of things before, but 'devil' is a first.)
Pavlova:
You opened my travelling case! How could you?!
Ryunosuke:
What? No no! We didn't touch it!
Susato:
That's right, Miss Pavlova. It was already open when we came into your cabin.
Pavlova:
Inspector!
Hosonaga:
Um...yes?
Pavlova:
Arrest this man! I know he did it! He is a criminal! Is it not enough that he has killed a man?!
Strogenov:
Da! And he is stowaway as well! If vixen promises not to steal chicken, do you believe?!
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Pavlova:
Take him away! He is a trespasser as well as everything else!
Strogenov:
Stowing away, trespassing, killing! She is right! You are devil!
Ryunosuke:
(It doesn't look good, does it?)
Strogenov:
There is cell below deck. Throw him in! Tomorrow we dock in Hong Kong. Then we give you straight to police!
Ryunosuke:
Wait! A cell...?
Susato:
Please, Inspector Hosonaga! Is there nothing you can do?
Hosonaga:
This is a Russian vessel. I really have no jurisdiction here. After my last effort to appeal to the captain's good nature, I think I'm out of options.
Susato:
This is terrible...
Ryunosuke:
(This is a real crisis. I've got to find a solution! Immediately!)
Examine

Leads to:
"What the...?"
Nikolina Pavlova
Ryunosuke:
Miss Pavlova, can I-
Pavlova:
Get out.
Ryunosuke:
Listen, I'm sorry that we snuck in here without your permission, but-
Pavlova:
Get out now.
Ryunosuke:
We just needed to investigate in here to help understand what happened to-
Pavlova:
Дo свидания!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, it's no use. She's not going to listen. I need to find someone who will...)
Bif Strogenov
Ryunosuke:
Please! Just give me a little more time!
Strogenov:
I do nothing for you! ...Except show you way to ship's prison cell!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, thanks, but no thanks.) But I'm innocent! I didn't kill anyone!
Strogenov:
And trespassing? And stowing away?
Ryunosuke:
Well, um...you know...sometimes life can lead you down some unusual avenues, and, well...
Strogenov:
Enough! You are guilty! Ship's cell is only place fit for you!
Ryunosuke:
(Come on, there has to be someone... Some saviour to rescue me from this crisis!)
Satoru Hosonaga
Hosonaga:
You've got yourself into a difficult situation here. By entering this cabin uninvited, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry. I, I was just so desperate to find a clue...
Hosonaga:
I'm afraid there's really nothing more I can do to help you. If I push my luck any further, a punch to the face will be the least of my worries.
Ryunosuke:
I'm really sorry...
Hosonaga:
I have to take responsibility for giving you the freedom to investigate Miss Pavlova's cabin. Now this has happened, I'll have to report to the captain at once.
Ryunosuke:
(I really need some help here. I need a saviour to rescue me from this crisis!)
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
I just need to keep calm and focus on the task at hand. Which is investigating.
Pavlova:
Don't touch my things!
Strogenov:
You want me to show you where crawfish hibernates?!
Susato:
Haiiiiii-YA!
Mr Naruhodo! What do you think you're doing?
Ryunosuke:
(Wow, everyone's attacking me! And I was just starting to think she was my friend... Isn't there anyone who can help me out of this mess?)
Ryunosuke:
What the...? What are you doing up there...? ...MR SHOLMES?!
Sholmes:
Naturally, I was analysing what a weight of twenty thousand roubles feels like on one's head. Have I not told you that as a detective, it is my business to know what other people do not? This isn't mere tomfoolery, my boy! Oh no no!
Ryunosuke:
Um, well...why were you hanging from that hook before then?
Sholmes:
Isn't it obvious? To properly assess the weight of the twenty thousand roubles, naturally. I wished to determine if it would bend that conceited-looking hook on the wall, so full of brag and bounce!
Ryunosuke:
(Agh, I never know whether to take this man seriously or not!)
Hosonaga:
Ah, you again! The 'great detective'!
Sholmes:
Ah, Inspector! I confess I've been looking for you. I have something to report to you most urgently.
Hosonaga:
Well, you might try looking for me somewhere other than a hook on the wall next time.
Strogenov:
What is to report? Speak!
Sholmes:
An urgent report from a great detective can mean but one thing... Yes... The case of the curious murder that took place last night, here on this vessel, the Steamship Burya... ...has been solved! By me, naturally.
Pavlova:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
Susato:
Really?!
Sholmes:
Yes, I have eliminated all other possibilities. No other explanations exist! So, allow me to illuminate all your minds! For I am about to reveal my great detective's greatly admired great deduction to the case!
Strogenov:
Hah! You have solved it? Even hedgehog understands this case! We all knew who was responsible for killing student boy this morning, when we found kriminal in wardrobe! It is this stowaway! And he has handcuffs to prove it!
Ryunosuke:
I didn't do it!
Hosonaga:
The trouble is, there doesn't appear to be anyone else who could have killed the victim. Because, as everyone knows, the cabin door was bolted shut from the inside. That means the culprit must be someone who was inside the cabin.
Susato:
Yes, it's what's called a locked room mystery in detective stories.
Strogenov:
Da! Locked room! That is point!
Pavlova:
The room...was locked...
Ryunosuke:
(Well I can't deny that. There's no way the bolt could have been drawn across from outside the cabin.)
Sholmes:
You are all quite mistaken. The cabin next door is not a so-called 'locked room' at all.
Susato:
What?
Sholmes:
Oh yes. There is another entrance. An entrance used last night by the culprit in order to gain access to the cabin despite the bolted door.
Hosonaga:
What other entrance? We never discovered one!
Sholmes:
Why, it gapes open-mouthed at you even as we speak! ...The ventilator, man!
Hosonaga:
The ventilator?
Strogenov:
Gah ha ha ha hah! You think this is funny?! I cannot even put my arm through that hole!
Ryunosuke:
(That's...because your arms are as thick as tree trunks.)
Hosonaga:
You're suggesting that the culprit entered and left the victim's cabin through that tiny opening? It's not possible!
Sholmes:
Ah, but it is. And last night, the victim even witnessed the intruder in the act of passing through the ventilator.
Pavlova:
.........
Susato:
Mr Sholmes, do you mean...? Are you referring to the words Kazuma-sama wrote in his diary? '1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint whistling sound. 1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.'
Sholmes:
Precisely, my dear madam.
Hosonaga:
But what does it mean? What is this 'speckled band'?
Sholmes:
The answer to that particular conundrum... is in this very cabin.
Ryunosuke:
M-Mr Sholmes? What are you doing?
Sholmes:
There is a distinct element of danger. But fear not; I am ready! What I am about to expose for you all to see will shock you to your cores! Behold!
KYAAAAAAGH!AAAAAAGH! Wha-What the...?
Strogenov:
.........
Sholmes:
Allow me to introduce you all... ...to the band! The speckled band!
Ryunosuke:
A snake?!
Sholmes:
Indubitably.
Pavlova:
.........
Hosonaga:
.........
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
......... Erm, Mr Sholmes... Just...one thing...
Sholmes:
Pray, what troubles you?
Ryunosuke:
Well, that snake...isn't really 'speckled', is it? It looks more...stripy...wouldn't you say?
Sholmes:
Hm?
Susato:
Yes, you're right. I think in this case, you'd have to call it... ...the striped band...wouldn't you?
Sholmes:
......... Heh heh heh... You both see, and observe. With distinction! However... ...do you not think that is precisely the trap into which the culprit wishes you to fall?
Susato:
Oh my goodness, really? It's, it's a trap?!
Ryunosuke:
(How exactly...?)
Sholmes:
I think perhaps it is time I explained the intricacies of my train of thought. Are you ready...Miss Pavlova?
Pavlova:
I'm sorry for the young man who died. But that is all. His death is nothing to do with me! This whole thing is nothing to do with me!
Sholmes:
There are two conclusions I have drawn from the facts. Number one... Last night, your 'friend' infiltrated the victim's cabin!
Pavlova:
Ah...
Sholmes:
And number two... That same friend was responsible for the victim losing his life!
Pavlova:
No...
Ryunosuke:
(She's turned as white as a bowl of rice again... Sholmes must be right! He's hit the nail on the head!)
Hosonaga:
This young woman's 'friend'...? Killed Mr Asogi...?
Strogenov:
.........! .........? .........!
Ryunosuke:
(It looks like he can't speak with that snake coiled around his head.)
Sholmes:
I would advise as little moment as possible, Seaman. You wouldn't want the fangs of that long friend in your neck. So, everyone...let us begin! Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!
The Great DeductionThe game is afoot!
Topic 1
Intruder's Identity
Sholmes:
Miss Pavlova, moments ago you claimed the following: 'His death is nothing to do with me! This whole thing is nothing to do with me!' Yet you cannot deceive yourself! Yes, when you recall those horrid events, your aching heart smarts with pain! And it is that very pain...that evidences your inextricable link to the victim's death. So, we ask...what was the nature of this intruder that stole into the victim's cabin on that portentous night. Why naturally, it was the 'friend' with which you boarded this vessel, was it not? Ah... As I suspected... Another telltale glance. Without doubt, your 'friend' is the writhing serpent we see before us! And yet...that fact leaves us in a quandary. The victim's written observations on the night in question tell of 'a speckled band'. Whereas regrettably... ...this specimen's markings do not fit that description in any way. What explanation can we then give, pray? What was this sight that fell upon the victim's eyes last night?
Pavlova:
No! Don't look at me! This has nothing to do with any of this!
Sholmes:
Oh but it does! You have the answer to this quandary even now...hidden behind your back. Yes! That which you are trying - but failing - to conceal, can only be the snake's sloughed skin! Evidently, after the subtle and horrible crime, this most deadly friend of yours... ...shed its original skin. No?
Pavlova:
I, I don't know what you are talking about!
Sholmes:
Last night, through the ventilator visible in this cabin, your then speckled friend slithered next door. Using the bell cord on the other side as a bridge, the serpent silently descended into the victim's quarters. In the dim light, it appeared to the young gentleman who was about to lose his life as a speckled band.
Pavlova:
.........
Sholmes:
In summary, the nature of this 'friend' of yours, which last night infiltrated the scene of the crime... ...is a rare breed of snake whose markings change each time it sloughs its skin! A snake so dreadful, we can only imagine it would be found in the deepest depths of India.

A beloved speckled snake
Topic 2
How Mr Asogi Died
Sholmes:
Moving on...we come to the heart of the matter. The grim demise of the victim. How did this young man lose his life? And why?
Pavlova:
.........
Sholmes:
According to the data of which I have been apprised, it would appear there were no visible signs of injury.
Pavlova:
Ah!
Sholmes:
In fact, the circumstances of the victim's death can only be explained by a terrible venom! Now, if we take that as fact... ...we can reasonably imagine that there remains evidence to affirm it at the scene of the crime.
Pavlova:
Oh no! Could there be...?
Sholmes:
Yes! An examination of the deceased's body will prove the cause of death conclusively! The almost - but not quite - imperceptible puncture wounds left by the venomous fangs will seal the truth. Yes, the vestiges of the snakebite delivered by your terrifying friend.
Pavlova:
This, this makes no sense!
Sholmes:
There is no point feigning ignorance, Miss Pavlova. ...After the incident, you endeavoured to hide everything, didn't you? But now your involuntary glance betrays the hiding place you chose. That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that travelling case! When we first met in this cabin, it came to my attention that your case moved periodically. Your serpent assassin was restless inside, no doubt.
Pavlova:
You, you don't...
Sholmes:
It is telling that the victim made note of a low whistling sound that he heard minutes before his end. That was your signal, was it not? The sound you had used to train your serpent friend.
Pavlova:
To...train...?
Sholmes:
Indeed, you'd put the serpent through this ventilator and wait. After a period, you'd summon it back with a whistle. You couldn't know if the animal had done its duty, so you would listen for signs of life next door. If the victim appeared not to have been dispatched, you'd release the snake once more. Do you deny this snake has undergone such training?
Pavlova:
It's not true!
Sholmes:
Having slithered through the ventilator and down the bell cord, the creature needed only to sink its fangs in once... ...and its venom would course through the victim's veins, ending his existence forever. That is the true nature of the speckled band that took the poor young man's life! There can be no doubt! My logic is infallible!
Topic 2
How Mr Asogi Died
Conclusion
Death by a venomous snake's bite
Sholmes:
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction of the speckled band!
.........
Sholmes:
Miss Pavlova has trained her pet snake as a killing machine. There on the floor, you will observe a saucer of milk. The promise of food is the key to training any creature.
Ryunosuke:
In-Incredible! You've solved the mystery!
Hosonaga:
Amazing! Your great deduction really lives up to its name! I see now why Herlock Sholmes has become such a household name!
Sholmes:
My dear man... It was nothing remarkable. As the Russians say, 'I could have done it with one left hand.'
Susato:
......... Um... Could I venture an opinion, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
But of course. What's on your mind?
Susato:
It's just, about your deductions before... Some things don't quite make sense to me.
Sholmes:
I welcome questions as to my method. And will answer both loudly and proudly!
Susato:
Oh. Well, good. First of all... ...snakes are egg-laying creatures. Part of the reptile family.
Sholmes:
You are well informed, madam.
Susato:
And reptiles, um...don't drink milk.
Sholmes:
Ah.
Susato:
It's really only mammals that like to drink milk, you see. So...I'm not sure it would be possible to train a snake using milk as a reward.
Sholmes:
No matter! No doubt Miss Pavlova used some other treat to encourage her pet to do her bidding. Milk was merely an example. The logic holds.
Susato:
Well, there is something else. Snakes have no ears.
Sholmes:
Ah.
Susato:
Yes, so I'm not sure it would really be possible to signal to a snake by whistling...
Sholmes:
But madam! What of the tales from Arabia? Have you not heard of the snakes that dance to the sounds of a flute?
Susato:
I think perhaps the performers play their music in time with the snakes' natural movements...
Sholmes:
Oh. I see. No hands, no feet, no EARS?! These creatures are so inept as to be practically useless!
Ryunosuke:
Don't take it out on the snakes, Mr Sholmes!
Susato:
Um...there is one other thing....
Sholmes:
You have more?!
Susato:
Snakes use the scales on their bellies to propel themselves. So...I'm not really sure that a snake could manage to climb up a flat bell cord like the ones in these cabins.
Sholmes:
Then it should try harder!
Susato:
Please, don't be angry with me, Mr Sholmes. The point is... ...even if the snake had gone through the ventilator to the next-door cabin, it couldn't have come back without help. What I'm trying to say... ...is that there are a number of reasons why it's difficult to imagine the snake could have had a part in this.
Sholmes:
.........
Hosonaga:
.........
Pavlova:
.........
Susato:
I think... ...we need to step in and help again, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Oh no, you don't mean...?
Susato:
Yes. We need to modify Mr Sholmes's latest deductions, and turn them into the great ones they ought to be!
Ryunosuke:
(I had a feeling that was coming.) Alright...let's give it a try!
Sholmes:
Just what I was waiting for, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Yes... Right!
Sholmes:
So, cast your eyes down to your wrists again.
Ryunosuke:
What? You've done it again!
Susato:
Your handcuffs are gone!
Hosonaga:
Where did they go?!
Sholmes:
Fear not. I shall see they're restored after our work is done.
Ryunosuke:
(I really wish you'd leave them off...)
Sholmes:
Now, everyone...let us begin! Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!

Ryunosuke:
She does have a pained expression on her face.
Susato:
Yes, that's true. She looks as though Kazuma-sama's death is weighing heavily on her mind.
Ryunosuke:
But you're not sure Mr Sholmes has read her quite correctly, is that it? (Could there be some other way to interpret her expression, then?)
Susato:
Let's take a moment... ...and really look very closely at Miss Pavlova.
Examine aching heart
Ryunosuke:
She really does look troubled.
Susato:
Yes, it's hard to believe she's putting that expression on to fool us.
Ryunosuke:
But if you look closely... ...it's almost like she's actually staring at something.
Susato:
At what, do you think?
Ryunosuke:
(Perhaps something's physically causing her pain. We should have a closer look...)
Examine right ear
Susato:
She has such petite ears among that beautiful hair. Like little pink shells.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, what's that? There's something attached to her ear.
Susato:
Ah... I expect that's what's called an 'earring'. It's a little piece of jewellery.
Ryunosuke:
An 'earring', is it? It really is tiny.
Susato:
Perhaps part of it is missing. Maybe it broke off. So now all that's left is the clasp part that attaches to the ear.
Ryunosuke:
(If that's the case... ...she doesn't appear to have noticed that it's broken.)
Examine left ear
Susato:
She has such petite ears among that beautiful hair. Like little pink shells.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, what's that? There's something dangling down from her ear.
Susato:
Ah, that's an 'earring'. The crescent moon part looks as though it's made from wood. It's charming, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Women do seem to love adornments like that. In their hair, around their necks, on their fingers... And even hanging from their ears, it seems!
Susato:
Well, jewellery is beautiful, Naruhodo-san.
Examine claw scratch
Susato:
Oh, Naruhodo-san, look! That looks like a very painful wound.
Ryunosuke:
It looks like a scratch made by some kind of small animal. (And fairly recently, too.)
Susato:
Well, whatever scratched her doesn't appear to be around here.
Present claw scratch
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Yes, when you recall those horrid events, that claw scratch smarts with pain!"
Present aching heart
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma - Mr Asogi - was my best friend. So I know what an aching heart feels like, believe me. We all know what it feels like! The world has an aching heart for loved ones lost!
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.
Ryunosuke:
An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.
Leads to:
"Yes, when you recall those horrid events, your aching heart smarts with pain!"
Present right ear or left ear
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Despite being in the neighbouring cabin, you failed to notice what was happening to Mr Asogi next door. And for that, you can't forgive yourself, can you? ...A feeling I understand all too well. The guilt is bad enough, but Mr Sholmes's accusatory words add salt to the wound and hurt your ears!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Yes, when you recall those horrid events, your aching heart smarts with pain!"
Yes, when you recall those horrid events, your aching heart smarts with pain! 
Susato:
If that expression on her face is to be believed...
Ryunosuke:
...She really is feeling genuine pain. (But what's really the cause of it...?)
Susato:
Let's have another good look at her, and see if we can make sense of it.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, when you recall those horrid events, that claw scratch smarts with pain!
Sholmes:
Indeed! And simple observation reveals...that the wound is fresh.
Pavlova:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Miss Pavlova, did you in fact receive that scratch... ...sometime last night?
Pavlova:
Ah! ......... When I think about the young man who died next door, I feel so sad. And when I am sad...the pain from this wound is worse.
Sholmes:
And it is that very pain...that evidences your inextricable link to the victim's death. So, we ask...what was the nature of this intruder that stole into the victim's cabin on that portentous night. Why naturally, it was the 'friend' with which you boarded this vessel, was it not? Ah... As I suspected... Another telltale glance. Without doubt, your 'friend' is the writhing serpent we see before us!
Ryunosuke:
It seems likely that the scratch mark on the back of Miss Pavlova's hand... ...was made by this 'friend' of hers, doesn't it? Except... ...snakes don't have claws, do they?
Susato:
No, they don't. They don't even have hands or feet on which claws might grow.
Ryunosuke:
Well then... ...if that snake isn't her pet, what is? What's the true identity of this friend of hers?
Susato:
We should follow her gaze, Naruhodo-san. That's where we'll find the answer!
Examine writhing serpent
Ryunosuke:
The more I look at this creature... ...the more its stripes stand out. It's a very impressive snake, isn't it?
Susato:
Oh yes, it really is. And it seems to be doing its best to squeeze this poor sailor's head until it bursts.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it's a terrifying sight. ...And slightly heart-warming at the same time. (Anyway, it would probably be a good idea not to get too close.)
Examine Seaman Strogenov
Ryunosuke:
There's no doubt, is there? She looked in this direction... ...straight at Seaman Strogenov!
Susato:
Well, they do seem to be friends of sorts... But I can't imagine how he could possibly fit through that ventilator.
Ryunosuke:
Don't forget that I managed to fit inside Kazuma's trunk when we first boarded this ship!
Susato:
......... I would ask what that proves, but... ...I think an equivocal little smile would be more effective.
Examine teapot
Ryunosuke:
I have a feeling... ...that it was this teapot that Miss Pavlova's eyes flickered over to before.
Susato:
...You think this is the friend she's been talking about?
Ryunosuke:
Well, we're all different, aren't we? Whatever we might say about it, if that's the way she feels...
Susato:
I don't think I'll say anything about it, then. You and the teapot can discuss it instead.
Ryunosuke:
(Wait, that's not what I meant!)
Examine photograph frame
Ryunosuke:
Ah, look at the photograph in this frame. (This must be something Miss Pavlova brought with her when she ran away.)
Susato:
She is exceptionally beautiful, isn't she?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's true. But personally... ...it's the little black creature she's holding that's caught my eye. (Maybe we'd better take a closer look at this...)
Examine Miss Pavlova
Ryunosuke:
That must be a stage costume she's wearing.
Susato:
It's quite stunning. I should like to have something like that.
Ryunosuke:
And she's wearing the twenty thousand roubles on her head as well, look.
Susato:
It's called a tiara, Naruhodo-san. And you shouldn't think of it purely in terms of its value.
Ryunosuke:
(She must be a strong-willed woman. To turn her back on the world stage and run away all on her own...)
Examine little kitten
Ryunosuke:
Look at the little cat Miss Pavlova is cuddling here.
Susato:
Oh, what a cute little kitten! It could vie with you, couldn't it, Naruhodo-san? For the blackest outfit!
Ryunosuke:
(Hm, a black kitten... And from the look of this picture at least, Miss Pavlova seems very attached to it.)
Examine photograph frame, then present little kitten
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Without doubt, your 'friend' is the little kitten we see before us!"
Present writhing serpent
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
With its deadly venom, this snake must be a tricky creature to befriend. But as a ballet dancer, you can't resist its graceful movement! Yes, you hope to learn the secrets of its slithery ways, and add a serpentine slant to your performances!
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.
Ryunosuke:
An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.
Leads to:
"Without doubt, your 'friend' is the writhing serpent we see before us!"
Present Seaman Strogenov
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Forget about how you could have brought him aboard in your case, or how he could fit through the ventilator. A true friend always finds a way for you! And what more dependable friend could you ask for... than Seaman Bif Strogenov?!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Without doubt, your 'friend' is the writhing serpent we see before us!"

Ryunosuke:

Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Without doubt, your 'friend' is the writhing serpent we see before us!"
Present photograph frame
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
You were looking over at this framed photographic print, weren't you, Miss Pavlova? But let's not be distracted by the print itself. Oh no... It's the frame that is your friend, isn't it? Because it so beautifully displays whatever you put inside it!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Without doubt, your 'friend' is the writhing serpent we see before us!"
Examine photograph frame, then present Miss Pavlova
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Considering the fact that you ran away from your homeland on your own... ...you have no friends at the moment. Except yourself. ...I mean! It's, it's not my intention to make you feel bad...!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Without doubt, your 'friend' is the writhing serpent we see before us!"
Without doubt, your 'friend' is the writhing serpent we see before us!
Ryunosuke:
We can be reasonably sure that Miss Pavlova's furtive glance was aimed at her friend.
Susato:
And that same friend is probably responsible for the scratch on the back of her hand. We also know that whatever it is, this friend must be small enough to pass through the ventilator.
Ryunosuke:
That really ought to narrow it down. (Let me scout around again in the direction she looked.)
Ryunosuke:
Without doubt, your 'friend' is the little kitten we see before us!
Sholmes:
Yes! The scratch on the back of your hand makes that abundantly clear.
Pavlova:
Oh no...
Ryunosuke:
The whereabouts of this black kitten isn't clear. But what is clear... ...is that you brought the animal with you when you ran away, didn't you?
Pavlova:
AAAGH! ......... Darka is my best friend. I couldn't leave her behind.
Sholmes:
Hm, Darka would appear to be a Russian Blue. And yet...that fact leaves us in a quandary. The victim's written observations on the night in question tell of 'a speckled band'. Whereas regrettably... ...this specimen's markings do not fit that description in any way. What explanation can we then give, pray? What was this sight that fell upon the victim's eyes last night?
Pavlova:
No! Don't look at me! This has nothing to do with any of this!
Sholmes:
Oh but it does! You have the answer to this quandary even now...hidden behind your back. Yes! That which you are trying - but failing - to conceal, can only be the snake's sloughed skin!
Susato:
Did you see that? She just took something out of her pocket and hid it behind her back!
Ryunosuke:
If she'd just left it in her pocket, no one would ever have known.
Susato:
Oh yes, ploys like that are Mr Sholmes's speciality! He's ever so cleverly forced her to reveal something!
Ryunosuke:
(I thought deduction was his speciality. ...Or maybe making me believe that was a ploy, too.)
Susato:
Anyway... ...I find it hard to believe that's the skin of a snake.
Ryunosuke:
(In which case... ...just what is Miss Pavlova hiding behind her back?)
Examine snake's sloughed skin
Ryunosuke:
Well, it is speckled, and it is a band, but... What is it? (It seems to be soft and fluffy. A long piece of cloth of some sort. And that looks like a handle at one end.)
Susato:
I think it may be a cat's toy. This sort is common in the West, apparently.
Ryunosuke:
How is that a toy for cats?
Susato:
Cats like to chase the band around and paw at it. Kittens in particular love that sort of play. You only need to wave it in front of them, and they pounce to catch it.
Ryunosuke:
Haha, that sounds positively adorable.
Changes "snake's sloughed skin" to "cat's toy"
Present cat's toy
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Yes! The thing you are trying - but failing - to conceal, is, um...a cat's toy!"
Present snake's sloughed skin
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Personally, I find it hard to see how this could possibly be a snake's skin. But that's what make me think it is! When all else fails, say the least likely thing!
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.

Ryunosuke:

You can try to distract us all you like, but I know what you were trying to hide: Your tiny ears! Don't give me that look of utter disbelief! I just notice people's ears. I can't help it!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Yes! That which you are trying - but failing - to conceal, can only be the snake's sloughed skin!"
Yes! That which you are trying - but failing - to conceal, can only be the snake's sloughed skin!
Ryunosuke:
What exactly is Miss Pavlova trying to hide, I wonder?
Susato:
I don't think there's any room for doubt.
Ryunosuke:
No, in a sense, there isn't. She's clearly concealing whatever it is behind her back.
Susato:
The question we need to ask is whether it really is the shed skin of a snake or not.
Ryunosuke:
(I should probably look at it in more detail...)
Ryunosuke:
Yes! The thing you are trying - but failing - to conceal, is, um...a cat's toy!
Sholmes:
Precisely! And the true nature of the now infamous speckled band!
Pavlova:
Ah!
Sholmes:
And it was this toy that you dangled through the ventilator. You waved it around, I presume? Naturally, the victim could not fail to notice it.
Ryunosuke:
But why? For what reason?
Sholmes:
My dear boy, there can be only one answer to that. After her feline friend disappeared through the ventilator into the neighbouring cabin... ...Miss Pavlova attempted to use the speckled cat's toy to incite the creature to return!
Ryunosuke:
Ah...
Sholmes:
In summary, the nature of this 'friend' of Miss Pavlova's, which last night infiltrated the scene of the crime... ...is a blithesome Russian Blue breed of cat by the name of Darka!
Pavlova:
KYAAAAAAGH!!!
Sholmes:
A truly troublesome feline, young Darka is proving to be. She must be caged once found. You will forgive us for borrowing the photograph of your pet, Miss Pavlova.
The photograph of Miss Pavlova and Darka has been entered into the Court Record.
Pavlova:
...It was after I gave her her food last night. That's when it happened. She scratched the back of my hand, and then ran up the bell cord. Before I could do anything, she had disappeared... through the ventilator. Darka... She is so naughty...

Death by a venomous snake's bite
Sholmes:
Moving on...we come to the heart of the matter. The grim demise of the victim. How did this young man lose his life? And why?
Pavlova:
.........
Sholmes:
According to the data of which I have been apprised, it would appear there were no visible signs of injury.
Pavlova:
Ah!
Sholmes:
In fact, the circumstances of the victim's death can only be explained by a terrible venom!
Susato:
What Mr Sholmes says is true. There no signs of a wound anywhere on Kazuma-sama's body.
Ryunosuke:
That's right. But Mr Sholmes seems to be unaware of one very important detail. (Kazuma wasn't poisoned.)
Susato:
Yes, it would seem so. Let's give him the information he's missing now!

Susato:
We should show him the evidence we have that details the cause of death. Even a great detective needs facts to work with!
Ryunosuke:
In fact, the circumstances of the victim's death can only be explained by the post-mortem report!
Sholmes:
Ah, yes! I knew it was one or the other!
Pavlova:
...! His neck was...?
Sholmes:
Indeed. The breaking of the cervical vertebrae is fatal. Only that goliath would be strong enough to survive that!
Ryunosuke:
Seaman Strogenov isn't some immortal freak, you know...
Sholmes:
The jury is out. Anyway, we have on good authority that the victim's neck was broken. Now, if we take that as fact... ...we can reasonably imagine that there remains evidence to affirm it at the scene of the crime.
Pavlova:
Oh no! Could there be...?
Sholmes:
Yes! An examination of the deceased's body will prove the cause of death conclusively!
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma died because his neck was broken. In other words, he was probably struck by something... or someone.
Susato:
Yes, that's a distinct possibility. As of yet, no weapon has been found, though.
Ryunosuke:
(Presumably Darka didn't silently creep up behind Kazuma and deal him a fatal blow...)
Susato:
I suppose... ...it's possible that he had a fall and hit the ground awkwardly. It could have been a terrible act of misfortune that he broke his neck completely by accident.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes. (A bad fall could explain it...)
Susato:
It's rather hard to believe of Kazuma-sama, though. He wasn't a clumsy man.
Ryunosuke:
Hm... Well, we need to fix this deduction somehow. Is there anything from the scene that could explain what happened?
Present Mark on Floor

Leads to:
"Yes! An examination of the mark on the floor will prove the cause of death conclusively!"
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Yes! An examination of the deceased's body will prove the cause of death conclusively!
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma died because of a broken neck. Either he was struck by something...or he fell badly and it happened by accident.
Susato:
There was something we found in his cabin that puzzled us, if you remember? A strange mark. It should be among the other evidence we've gathered.
Ryunosuke:
(Alright, let me look through the evidence again for the strange mark Susato-san's talking about.) Could that mark explain what happened...?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! An examination of the mark on the floor will prove the cause of death conclusively!
Sholmes:
This particular mark, so prominently visible next to the victim's body, is a deposit of shoe polish.
Pavlova:
Shoe polish?
Sholmes:
Indeed. Positively identified by a little analysis device I constructed, which I carry now as a matter of course. Beeswax, tallow and dye were my results. The undeniable ingredients of shoe polish.
Ryunosuke:
And the colour of the polish is a perfect match to the colour of Mr Asogi's laced leather shoes.
Pavlova:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Looking at this mark, it's not hard to imagine what happened. For some reason... ...Mr Asogi must have caught his foot at that point on the floor and tripped.
Pavlova:
Please no...
Sholmes:
And, by a dreadful turn of misfortune, caught his neck against some immovable object as he fell to the floor. Suffering a fatal blow to the spine, the victim's vertebrae shattered, and in that instant...he lost his life.
Pavlova:
NOOOOOOOOO!!! ......... I don't know... I don't know anything about this!
Ryunosuke:
Is that really true, Miss Pavlova?
Pavlova:
...!
Ryunosuke:
What about the evidence left at the scene where Mr Asogi lost his life?
Sholmes:
Yes, the facts are as clear as day to me! You did all you could to conceal the incriminating evidence. But now your involuntary glance betrays the hiding place you chose. That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that travelling case!
Susato:
I, I don't believe it! Kazuma-sama merely tripped over and...and now he's no more? It can't be true! I refuse to accept it!
Ryunosuke:
I know it's hard to believe, but the mark on the floor does seem to suggest that's what happened.
Susato:
But...
Ryunosuke:
And if this part of Mr Sholmes's deduction is right... ...Miss Pavlova is trying to hide some evidence that would prove it. Here in this cabin...somewhere in the direction that she just cast her eyes.
Susato:
Where, I wonder?
Ryunosuke:
Let's have a good look around. The answer must be here somewhere!
Examine travelling case
Ryunosuke:
This is where Miss Pavlova hid her friend.
Susato:
That's right. And it wasn't a snake, after all.
Ryunosuke:
No, it was that little kitten she calls Darka. Not that it's anywhere to be seen now. It seems to have let itself out of the case and gone exploring.
Susato:
I expect it's wrapped itself around someone's head somewhere, trying to make a new friend.
Ryunosuke:
Either that or it's scratching their hand to pieces. (The point is, where has it got to?)
Examine wastepaper basket
Susato:
This is a wastepaper basket. Perhaps all the first-class cabins have them.
Ryunosuke:
But Miss Pavlova only started occupying this cabin late last night. Presumably there's not much rubbish in there yet. Oh, what's that...?
Susato:
It's a broken piece of glass, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, it is. And I feel like I've seen it somewhere before...)
Susato:
...If it looks familiar, perhaps it's more than your mind simply playing tricks on you.
Examine tiara
Ryunosuke:
Ah, somebody appears to have dropped twenty thousand roubles here!
Susato:
It hasn't been dropped, Naruhodo-san. It's been placed.
Ryunosuke:
(I'm starting to sound like Mr Sholmes...)
Susato:
Stop trying to sound like the great detective!
Present wastepaper basket (after examining it)

Ryunosuke:

"That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that travelling case!"
That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that travelling case!
Susato:
I still can't bring myself to believe it. It just seems so unlike Kazuma-sama to stumble carelessly and then...fall to his death.
Ryunosuke:
I know it's hard to believe, but the mark on the floor does seem to suggest that's what happened.
Susato:
But...
Ryunosuke:
I have a feeling there's something here in this cabin that links Miss Pavlova to that mark. And I suspect we'll find it in the direction that she guiltily cast her eyes before!
Ryunosuke:
That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that wastepaper basket!
Pavlova:
Ah!
Sholmes:
Here we have a fragment of some intricate glass object, it would seem. ...One that has a familiar air, in fact.
Ryunosuke:
Precisely! We found another piece of broken glass on the floor in Mr Asogi's cabin. And, as you can see...the two pieces fit together perfectly!
Pavlova:
Oh no...
Sholmes:
So, Miss Pavlova, shall we consider what this tells us? Why would it be, that part of this glass object, which was evidently broken at the scene of the victim's death... ...should be found in the wastepaper basket in your cabin?
Pavlova:
KYAAAAAAAAAH!!!
Sholmes:
You're well acquainted with this glass bell, are you not?
Pavlova:
......... I... I don't...
Sholmes:
'I don't know' in that hushed Russian accent of yours won't save you this time, dear girl. ...Why? Because we have conclusive evidence linking you to the bell in question.
Pavlova:
What?!
Sholmes:
Take it away, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Erm... Yes... The evidence linking Miss Pavlova and the little glass bell... That would be...

Ahem! My dear fellow, that evidence... ...deserves one of Miss Pavlova's trademark dismissals, I would say. Would you do the honours, young lady?
Pavlova:
I...don't know...
Sholmes:
Perhaps you would care to propose some other piece of evidence. The answer is really quite simple. But then, there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.
Leads back to:
"Erm... Yes..."
Ryunosuke:
If you look at this photograph, you can clearly see... ...hanging from Darka's collar... ...the very glass bell in question!
Pavlova:
I...
Sholmes:
The truth has caught up with you, Miss Pavlova. The young man who lost his life last night did so after a truly inauspicious fall.
Ryunosuke:
And the cause of that fateful stumble?
Your absent feline friend...Darka!

Why don't you tell us now, Miss Pavlova? Tell us exactly what happened last night.
Pavlova:
......... It was...a little after one in the morning. It was so late, but I hadn't had time to feed Darka. So I gave her some food. And then, all of a sudden, she scratched me and jumped out of my hands.
Hosonaga:
People do say that cats become very anxious and nervous in new environments.
Pavlova:
She was so fast. She disappeared through the ventilator before I could stop her.
Sholmes:
And that is how you acquired the rather nasty wound on the back of your hand, I take it?
Pavlova:
Yes. And I had read the, um...rules on the wall. I knew that I was not allowed Darka with me.
Hosonaga:
Yes, modern science suggests that animals can carry infectious diseases. It's a precaution really.
Pavlova:
So I listened and listened, trying to hear if there was some noise in the next cabin. It was very quiet. I was sure, if someone was there, he must be sleeping.
Sholmes:
So at that point, you thought it safe to try to lure the kitten back again? By dangling the end of the toy through the ventilator and into the adjourning cabin.
Pavlova:
Darka always loves this toy. But it didn't work. Nothing worked. I tried using her favourite toy, I tried whistling to her softly, but nothing... She didn't return.
Ryunosuke:
(So the 'faint whistling' sound Kazuma wrote about in his diary was Miss Pavlova, trying to retrieve her pet...)
Sholmes:
Cats have a propensity to remain hidden in the shadows when frightened.
Pavlova:
Yes. So there was nothing else I could do. I just had to wait until she had calmed down. But then...
MIAOOOOOW!
*Thud*
Pavlova:
I, I nearly passed out with shock. I heard her cry out, and then... Oh, it was such a dreadful bang! Then afterwards, nothing. It was totally silent.
Ryunosuke:
(Kazuma was...)
Hosonaga:
......... From the appearance of the brown mark on the floor... ...it seems likely that what you heard was the victim stepping on the glass bell and tripping up. The SS Burya is a large vessel, but even she can pitch and roll violently without warning. If Mr Asogi was already off balance as a result of the ship lurching when the kitten got under his feet... ...the combination of unfortunate factors could easily have caused him to fall over.
Susato:
.........
Hosonaga:
But what became of the kitten afterwards?
Pavlova:
......... In the end, I managed to get her to come back through the ventilator.
Sholmes:
Yet Darka is nowhere to be seen.
Pavlova:
I...must have forgotten to lock my case. And now she's disappeared again.
Sholmes:
Gracious, that cat is as insufferably restless as I am!
Ryunosuke:
(Well, he knows something about himself, at least...)
Pavlova:
When I woke this morning, I heard that a young man in the cabin next to mine had died. But I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone what had happened. I was too scared. Scared that they would send me back.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Hold on a minute... What about the snake?!
Hosonaga:
You're right! Where is it?!
Ryunosuke:
If the snake isn't your friend, Miss Pavlova, then whose is it, and where did it come from? What on earth is such a dangerous creature doing on board this ship?!
Strogenov:
Oh. I didn't say? Snake is my friend. His name is Pirozhko.
Sholmes:
Hm...?
Hosonaga:
Wha...?
Ryunosuke:
WHAAAT?!
Hosonaga:
That snake belongs to you?
Strogenov:
He escaped from cage when emergency alarm sounded. I was looking for him. I did not expect to find him in here!
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, how did that snake get into this cabin?)
Hosonaga:
But... ...animals are not permitted on board!
Strogenov:
Hah! We are at sea for ONE YEAR! You want to be so long without close friend? Without someone who understands?!
Ryunosuke:
(...Couldn't you find someone a little more...human who understands you better?)
Sholmes:
But my dear burly fellow... ...a gargantuan venomous snake?! Surely you can appreciate the danger you're putting everyone in?
Strogenov:
No venom.
Sholmes:
Hm?
Strogenov:
Pirozhko does not have venom. He is harmless! Very long, but very gentle! He is adorable, like Granny!
Sholmes:
It's...venomless?
Strogenov:
Yes. Now he is hungry, so he is in bad mood. But once I feed him, you will see big smile!
Ryunosuke:
And...you feed him...what? Milk, I suppose?
Strogenov:
Hah! Like they say they milk chickens? ...Ridiculous! Snakes that drink milk are only in stupid stories! Pirozhko eats mouses! Big, fat, round mouses!
Ryunosuke:
Ah... Oh, so... ...is that what the mousetrap in the passageway out there is for?
Strogenov:
Of course. How else can I catch my friend's favourite food?!
Ryunosuke:
(Nothing says 'top of the food chain' like the look in their eyes right now...)
Sholmes:
......... It refuses to drink milk, it can't hear a whistle, it can't climb up a bell cord and it's not even venomous... How the deuce did something so inept land a starring role?!
Strogenov:
Is not my fault! I do not make up stories! My Pirozhko is nothing to do with this incident!
Ryunosuke:
......... (So that's what happened... That's the truth behind my best friend's tragic death...)
Sholmes:
.........
Hosonaga:
.........
Pavlova:
.........
Susato:
......... Miss Pavlova...
Pavlova:
...!
Susato:
I understand the difficult situation you've found yourself in. And I do sympathise. But please remember this: A young man lost his life. If you're going to attempt to cover up your guilt with lies, then... ...then no matter what the circumstances, I cannot forgive you!
Pavlova:
But...
Hosonaga:
What are you talking about, Miss Mikotoba? What lies? Miss Pavlova just confessed everything! It was just a series of unfortunate events. An accident.
Sholmes:
.........
Susato:
I'm no great detective like Mr Sholmes. I don't have a gift for knowing the truth. But even I can see...that was not the truth! Don't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?!
Ryunosuke:
......... (To be perfectly honest, yes. There's a discrepancy in Miss Pavlova's story, I'm sure of it. I just can't quite put my finger on it.)
Sholmes:
......... I confess... ...I was intending to let Scotland Yard deal with any outstanding issues on this matter.
Ryunosuke:
Oh!
Sholmes:
I am only present here for a very specific reason. The truth is, you, Mr Naruhodo, are simply a distraction.
Ryunosuke:
A distraction?!
Sholmes:
I do hope you've not been finding your shackles too uncomfortable.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (Not again! When did he do that?!)
Sholmes:
Especially as they're on your wrists as a result of my intervention. I was rather hoping I could resolve matters before we made our next port call.
Ryunosuke:
You were, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Yes, but I overlooked one important detail. The deceased young man was a very close companion of yours... ...was he not?
Ryunosuke:
......... Yes. Kazuma was my closest friend. I owed him my freedom, even.
Susato:
.........
Sholmes:
In that case, we must follow this to its conclusion. No further distractions. You must uncover the REAL truth here, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Yes... Whatever that may be... (The key to this is the discrepancy in Miss Pavlova's story, I'm sure. If I can chase that down, maybe the truth will become clear. The truth about how you really died. About how that scene in your cabin really came to be...!) Alright. I'll see what I can do.
Sholmes:
Excellent.
Susato:
Thank you, Mr Naruhodo.
Pavlova:
.........
Sholmes:
So then, shall we begin?
Ryunosuke:
Yes!
Sholmes:
What we should ponder first... ...is the victim who lost his life in a cabin that was bolted shut from the inside. Was this truly an unfortunate accident? Or was it in fact no accident at all? That is what we must establish in the first instance.
Hosonaga:
But we've already established it, haven't we? The man tripped over the kitten that had climbed into his cabin via the ventilator. Tragic, yes. But still an accident.
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Wait! Let's just take a step back. It doesn't make sense if that's really what happened, does it?
Hosonaga:
I'm going to have to ask you to spell it out for me, I'm afraid.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, it's starting to take shape now. There's a clear contradiction between the facts and Miss Pavlova's story here.) The evidence is right there in Kazuma's cabin. It's undeniable! His death couldn't possibly have been a mere accident!
Pavlova:
...!
Hosonaga:
R-Really?
Sholmes:
Let us show our hand, Mr Naruhodo! Time to present the evidence! The evidence that proves unequivocally that the victim's death was no mere accident! 
Present Crime Scene Photograph
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The truth is clearly recorded in this photographic print! There's no way that Mr Asogi could have left this message on the floor!
Hosonaga:
That script... It's Russian, isn't it?
Sholmes:
Indeed it is. The word written means 'wardrobe'.
Hosonaga:
I see what you mean. Most people would leave a dying message in their native language. Japanese in this case.
Pavlova:
But, but maybe he was studying Russian! It is a simple language. He, he could have picked it up very fast!
Ryunosuke:
(That doesn't seem likely.) That's actually not the point. It makes no difference whether he knew Russian or not.
Hosonaga:
Sorry? What do you mean?
Ryunosuke:
Exactly what I said before: There is no way that Mr Asogi could have left this message on the floor. And the reason why is clearly explained in here: 'Damage to the cervical vertebrae resulting in instant death.' ...Instant death.
Hosonaga:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
Which means...after the victim fell to the floor, he couldn't possibly have written anything. Because he was already dead!
Pavlova:
.........!
Susato:
That's not the only reason, either. There's something else we found in Mr Asogi's cabin. A remnant of something that couldn't possibly have been there, if what Miss Pavlova told us was true!
Hosonaga:
What?!
Ryunosuke:
(So, Susato-san has noticed it too, then...) Putting this message on the floor aside, there's something else that gives the truth away. Another piece of evidence that proves this was no accident! In other words... 
Present Mark on Floor
Ryunosuke:
 
Leads to:
"This! This piece of broken glass next to the mark on the floor!"
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
 
Sholmes:
What point are you trying to make with that evidence?
Ryunosuke:
I'm starting to see how Kazuma's death really happened! ...I think.
Sholmes:
...'I think'...that you are starting to see nothing of the sort! And that was the evidence to prove it.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Susato:
If it was no accident, then what we should be looking for is one of two things: Either the absence of something you would expect to find at the scene of an accident... ...or the presence of something you wouldn't.
Sholmes:
Most compendiously put, my dear madam!
Ryunosuke:
Ah...I see...
Sholmes:
Hm, I confess your rather languid 'I see' doesn't fill me with confidence, Mr Naruhodo.
Susato:
Don't worry, Mr Naruhodo, I believe in you! ...Well, more than Mr Sholmes does, anyway.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, it's starting to take shape now. There's a clear contradiction between the facts and Miss Pavlova's story here.) The evidence is right there in Kazuma's cabin. It's undeniable!
Leads back to:
"Putting this message on the floor aside, there's something else that gives the truth away."
Ryunosuke:
This! This piece of broken glass next to the mark on the floor!
Hosonaga:
But that's the glass bell the kitten had around its neck. We already know all about that. It was broken in half when the victim tripped over the cat and fell. So we already have a satisfactory explanation. Where's the flaw in that logic?
Ryunosuke:
Unfortunately, there is a very big flaw. A fatal flaw!
Hosonaga:
What?!
Ryunosuke:
If that's really what happened... ...then how did one half of the bell end up back here in this cabin?
Hosonaga:
Ah!
Susato:
Yes, remember that we found the other half of the glass bell in that wastepaper basket. Would you care to explain that...Miss Pavlova?
Pavlova:
Oh no...
Leads to:
"Both these pieces of evidence clearly point to the same conclusion..."

Ryunosuke:
Both these pieces of evidence clearly point to the same conclusion... That when Mr Asogi died last night in his cabin... ...there was someone else in the room!
Pavlova:
...!
Ryunosuke:
And that same person...deliberately arranged the scene to disguise the truth... ...in order to cover up their own guilt!
Pavlova:
KYAAAAAAH!!!
Susato:
Yes, there was someone else present in Mr Asogi's-
???:
Hold it!
???:
You are wasting time!
Strogenov:
Someone else was there? Da! Of course! We know this!
Ryunosuke:
What are you talking about?
Strogenov:
Bulkhead was bolted shut from inside. There was no way in or out!
Hosonaga:
Oh yes...
Strogenov:
And only other person in cabin when young student died...was you!
Ryunosuke:
 
Ryunosuke:
It's true, I was in the cabin when it happened.
Sholmes:
You were shut inside the cabin's wardrobe, to be precise about the details.
Ryunosuke:
But I don't know Russian! There's no way I would have left that message!
Sholmes:
Not 'would have'... There's no way you could have left that message...to be precise about the details.
Ryunosuke:
...Would you mind?
Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Forgive me, my dear fellow!
Ryunosuke:
As I was saying... The person in question wrote the word 'wardrobe' in Russian on the floor... ...in an attempt to incriminate me for the crime, even though I had been asleep in there the entire time.
Susato:
And then, the same person picked up the broken glass bell that had fallen to the floor... ...for fear of it becoming evidence that would show how Mr Asogi really died.
Hosonaga:
But why wouldn't this person have taken all the pieces of the bell away? Leaving half behind was always going to raise questions.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, well, um...
Sholmes:
It was past one o'clock in the early hours of the morning. The cabin would have been quite dark. The single, small lamp suspended from the ceiling would barely have cast any light onto the floor there. Little wonder then, that the culprit failed to notice a fragment of the tiny item.
Pavlova:
You all suspect me...don't you?
Strogenov:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
S-Seaman Strogenov!
Strogenov:
Nina is woman of sea! She is daughter of strong sailor. Two years ago, they noticed her dancing skills and she went away to join ballet company. But before...she was dancer on this ship. A member of ship's band. You do not accuse ship's angel of being kriminal!
Ryunosuke:
Ah, so that's it...
Strogenov:
You say that when young student died, Nina was there in his cabin. But that is not possible! I give my tooth!
Sholmes:
Hm, well... This is all most interesting... And why would you 'give your tooth', pray? How can you be so sure?
Strogenov:
Hmph! You are great detective! You should know! Look truth in eyes! Cabin bulkhead was bolted shut from inside! Nobody could go into cabin. Not Nina, not anyone! Or you want to tell me that killer can walk through locked doors? ...Nyet! It's impossible!
Ryunosuke:
Ugh! (He's right...)
Susato:
But wait! I've read about this in detective stories. People often tie thread around door latches so they can open and close them from the outside!
Strogenov:
Thread? Are you stupid? These bulkheads are not barn doors!
Sholmes:
Certainly not. These are watertight doors, as one would expect to find on any modern steamship. Constructed of heavy steel, with not a gap in sight. No threads or needles or magnets could have been used.
Susato:
No... No, of course not. I thought so, too. But Mr Naruhodo suggested it earlier, so...
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san! How could you shift it onto me like that?!)
Hosonaga:
So Seaman Strogenov has a valid point. The cabin door couldn't have been bolted shut from the outside.
Sholmes:
Not necessarily...
Strogenov:
What?
Sholmes:
I put it to you that I could bolt this cabin door... ...without laying a finger on it.
Pavlova:
...!
Sholmes:
And in this very cabin... ...we can see the traces of the method I have in mind having been used before!
Hosonaga:
I don't believe it!
Sholmes:
Well, Mr Naruhodo? I believe you know what I mean, don't you?
Ryunosuke:
(A way to shut the bolt of the cabin door from the outside?) One way does spring to mind, yes.
Susato:
Do you really know what Mr Sholmes means, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. And so should you. Because we've seen it happen!
Sholmes:
Indeed we have! So, would you care to do the honours, Mr Naruhodo? Point out the telling signs of the method that was used to slide the cabin door bolt across from the outside! 
Present shelf
Ryunosuke:
 
Leads to:
"Look at the bookcase there."
Present anywhere else
Ryunosuke:
 
Ryunosuke:
This is it! This shows how it was done!
Sholmes:
Hm, it certainly shows how something was done, I concur. In fact, it's an excellent way to show how easy it is to jump to the wrong conclusion!
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Sholmes:
But a truly dismal way to show how the bolt could be made to slide shut from outside the cabin!
Ryunosuke:
(Did you really need to say 'truly dismal'...?) 
Susato:
Surely it can't really be possible to make the bolt slide shut without touching it all, can it?
Ryunosuke:
I'm sure that it is. Something in the back of my mind tells me so...
Leads back to:
"Do you really know what Mr Sholmes means, Mr Naruhodo?"
Ryunosuke:
Look at the bookcase there. See how all the books and things on it have toppled over?
Susato:
That must have happened when the ship made its emergency stop before.
Hosonaga:
Yes, that's right. It's a very powerful vessel, after all. When the engines are thrown into reverse, a violent jolt goes across the entire ship. Any small objects that aren't fastened down are bound to fall over.
Susato:
I believe... Yes, it's what's known as the force of 'inertia' acting on the objects.
Ryunosuke:
(Is there nothing Susato-san doesn't know...?! Or that isn't in her book, at least?) Well, whatever it's called, the same force that pushed over those books on the bookcase... ...also made something else in this cabin move. The bolt on the cabin door.
Susato:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
It was very obvious just after the emergency stop that the ship made earlier. We had come into this cabin not long before, and we hadn't bolted the door. But then...
???:
Hello! Is anybody in there? Shout if you need assistance!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, that sounds like...
Susato:
...Inspector Hosonaga.
Susato:
Oh yes! That's it! When the ship stopped suddenly, the bolt flew across and locked the door!
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It's made of metal, but it's small and light enough to be moved by the ship's sudden change of speed. ...Or the force of 'ineptia', if you want to call it that.
Hosonaga:
Are, are you trying to say that last night... After Mr Asogi was killed... ...the SS Burya made another emergency stop?!
Ryunosuke:
When I woke up this morning and looked around the cabin, I thought it looked a little odd. All the books on the shelves had toppled over. And all the ornaments. It was almost as if someone had run their hand across the shelves and deliberately knocked everything over.
Susato:
Oh yes, I remember that! And I stood them all up again, didn't I?
Ryunosuke:
Then when we came into this cabin, we were surprised to see the same thing in here. All the books and everything had toppled over, just like in Mr Asogi's cabin.
Susato:
...Oh my!
Ryunosuke:
Do you have anything to say about this, Miss Pavlova?
Pavlova:
.........
Strogenov:
Are you out of your mind? You say Burya made emergency stop?!
Hosonaga:
It does seem a little far-fetched. How could that possibly have happened? Unless you're saying that the culprit is actually someone from the engine room?
Sholmes:
Oh, it is simple enough.
Hosonaga:
Hm?
Sholmes:
Are you forgetting the button in the passageway outside, used to trigger the emergency alarm?
Susato:
Oh yes, of course... There was a notice, wasn't there? Telling you only to press the button in times of emergency.
Sholmes:
On dark nights when the fog is dense, the captain cannot afford to rely on the eyes of his lookout alone. Hence the placement of a number of buttons around the vessel to allow any crewman to raise the alarm. The sort of button one is almost compelled to press to satisfy one's curiosity...
Strogenov:
......... Wait! It, it was you?!
Sholmes:
When the button is pressed, two things happen in the interests of safety: The emergency alarm bell rings, and the vessel comes to a complete stop. ...As indeed it did a little earlier today.
Hosonaga:
.........
Pavlova:
.........
Susato:
Mr Sholmes... Surely it wasn't you who...
Sholmes:
As I always say, a button has but one purpose in life. To be pressed! Whatever the occasion!
Ryunosuke:
(He sounds almost proud of himself!)
Strogenov:
How dare you mess with ship?! I report you to captain! You are in much trouble now!
Sholmes:
Now now, I'm sure all that can wait until later. Let us not overlook the fact that we have now learnt a valuable lesson. When the vessel makes an emergency stop, the bolts on the cabin doors slide closed. So...what we must now consider...
Susato:
Yes, it all comes down to one thing now. Last night, after what happened to Mr Asogi... ...did this ship make an emergency stop...or did it not?
Strogenov:
You are idiots! Burya is huge ship with many passengers. If we make emergency stop, even in middle of night... ...there would be chaos everywhere!
Sholmes:
What are your thoughts, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
......... Well... ...it's certainly possible that some kind of emergency happened last night. We have evidence to support that idea.
Susato:
Really?! What evidence, Mr Naruhodo?
Sholmes:
Fascinating! Do show us, my good man! What evidence promotes the theory that some emergency gripped this vessel last night?
Present Ship's Log

Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
This! You see? Do you see, Mr Sholmes?!
Sholmes:
Most regrettably... ...I see that the only emergency is that which your logical faculties are immersed in!
Ryunosuke:
Argh! (I knew he'd have something clever to say!)
Susato:
I'm really not at all sure that any evidence exists that can help us here.
Sholmes:
Remember, Miss Susato, that evidence may not always be that which 'exists' per se.
Susato:
Oh!
Sholmes:
There are days when evidence is that which is distinctly 'missing'.
Ryunosuke:
(Today being one of those days, presumably.) Now you say that, one piece of evidence does come to mind, actually.
Leads back to:
"Really?! What evidence, Mr Naruhodo?"
Ryunosuke:
Seaman Strogenov... ...it's your duty to patrol the first-class area of the ship, isn't that right?
Strogenov:
Da! That is correct. ...Why?
Ryunosuke:
And the ship's log here... This would be where you record the details of your duties?
Strogenov:
What are you doing with that?! That is mine!
Sholmes:
Ah, you rather carelessly left it atop the little makeshift bureau in the passageway out there. But as responsible passengers, we took it into our care with a mind to return it to you later.
Strogenov:
I left it there on purpose! That is where I put it always!
Ryunosuke:
The point is, looking at what you usually record... ...it's clear that under normal circumstances, you write the phrase 'Nothing to report' every thirty minutes. But from two o'clock last night until first light this morning...nothing was recorded at all.
Hosonaga:
Nothing recorded in the log?!
Strogenov:
That is... Da! Because nothing happened!
Ryunosuke:
But if nothing happened, you would normally write 'Nothing to report', wouldn't you?
Strogenov:
...*Gulp*
Sholmes:
Indeed so. Which tells us that shortly after 2 a.m... ...something happened here aboard the SS Burya.
Strogenov:
...!
Sholmes:
Something sufficiently significant to make you forget to fill in the ship's log, in fact.
Susato:
Are you suggesting... ...that the ship really did make an emergency stop in the middle of the night?
Strogenov:
Stop talking RUBBISH!
Hosonaga:
......... If I'm perfectly honest... ...I find that a little hard to believe myself.
Ryunosuke:
Oh? Why?
Hosonaga:
Well, because if something as major as an emergency stop really had happened... ...surely all of us would have noticed?
Susato:
That's very true. Thanks to the emergency stop we experienced earlier, we all know what it feels like now. The ship lurched so violently. And the alarm bell was so loud... I can't imagine that anybody would sleep through that, even if it happened in the dead of night.
Ryunosuke:
Well, no... That's, that's a good point...
Sholmes:
......... What of...the throbbing?
Hosonaga:
Sorry? What do you mean?
Sholmes:
Your head, man. The throbbing of your head since this morning. We have all suffered with it.
Susato:
Ah!
Hosonaga:
Oh, yes... I have had a headache, you're right. In fact, I haven't been feeling myself since I woke up today.
Susato:
Nor have I! My head has been feeling heavy ever since dawn.
Sholmes:
Yes, you've all been afflicted, haven't you? Just as I suspected.
Ryunosuke:
(He's right! My head's been throbbing today, too! And since eating dinner yesterday evening, everything has felt sort of hazy. I can't really remember anything that happened after I climbed back inside the wardrobe... Then the first thing I noticed this morning was the throbbing pain in my head. I had already been dragged out of the wardrobe... ...and had those handcuffs put on me by that point... Why didn't I wake up when all that was happening to me?!)
Sholmes:
Tell me, Mr Naruhodo... ...you boarded this vessel as a stowaway, didn't you?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, um... Well yes. ...Sorry.
Sholmes:
The stowaway class of accommodation doesn't usually include meals. ...What did you survive on?
Ryunosuke:
Ah, well, Kazuma looked after me. He was always happy to share his meals.
Sholmes:
So you enjoyed some of the whole roast chicken dish that was served yesterday evening, I take it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! In fact... ...I had all of that. Kazuma wasn't fond of chicken.
Sholmes:
Oh really? So the victim didn't eat any of the chicken at all?
Ryunosuke:
That's right. He didn't touch it. ...Is that relevant?
Sholmes:
......... My dear fellow, does that not strike you?
Susato:
Oh! Mr Sholmes! Do you mean to say... ...that there was something wrong with the chicken?!
Sholmes:
...I do.
Ryunosuke:
No! (Really? Is that really true?)
Sholmes:
The meal prepared for the passengers last night had been tampered with. Tampered with by the addition of a soporific, designed to induce a very deep slumber in those who consumed it.
Hosonaga:
...A sleeping drug?
Ryunosuke:
Do you mean...? ...whoever did this laced every meal with a sleeping drug so no one would notice the ship's emergency stop?!
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! Of course that's not what Mr Sholmes means. What a far-fetched idea!
Sholmes:
...Precisely. Lacing every meal of every passenger on board with a soporific drug would certainly be impossible. ...Unless, that is, every single member of the crew was a conspirator!
Hosonaga:
What?!
Susato:
Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
...Well, Seaman?
Strogenov:
Eh...!
Sholmes:
I'm sorry to say that any more deception in this matter will get you nowhere.
Strogenov:
.........
Sholmes:
If you refuse to talk, there would have to be an inquiry made through the shipping company, of course. And were that to happen, every member of the crew, and the captain himself, would be hauled over the coals. ...For aiding and abetting a renegade.
Strogenov:
...! .........
Pavlova:
Please...no more. I will tell everything.
Strogenov:
Eh?!
Pavlova:
I cannot make problems like this for everyone any more...
Sholmes:
These crewmen are your former comrades, I believe.
Pavlova:
Yes. So when I decided to...run away... I asked them to help me.
Strogenov:
We all agreed to help. Everyone together. She threw away everything. Her fame in the ballet... Mother Russia... We wanted to help our angel.
Hosonaga:
I don't believe it...
Strogenov:
You are right. We put sleeping drug in chicken last night.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I remember now. I did notice chewing on a lump of something strange and bitter at one point...
Strogenov:
Da. We could not make all drug... How do you say? ...Dissolve?
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... Talk about heavy seasoning...)
Strogenov:
...At midnight, in waters near Shanghai, we brought our angel on board. She was helped by comrade on shore with small fishing boat.
Sholmes:
While all the passengers of the SS Burya slept soundly... ...thanks to the almost magical effects of the slumber-inducing potion their evening meals had contained.
Ryunosuke:
So, if that's what happened... ...the only people awake on the ship last night... ...were the crew, people who dislike chicken and... ...the newly boarded passenger, Miss Pavlova.
Pavlova:
.........
Ryunosuke:
...And that means it would have been possible for you. You could have used the emergency stop trick to lock Kazuma's cabin door!
Pavlova:
.........
Hosonaga:
But how does that make sense? Surely every cabin door would have ended up locked in that case, and there would have been complete chaos.
Sholmes:
Oh, I wouldn't say so.
Hosonaga:
What?
Ryunosuke:
Ah, of course! Just like us, all the other passengers would have eaten their evening meal of chicken in their cabins. After which they would have been overwhelmed by tiredness because of the sleeping drug.
Sholmes:
Quite. And accordingly, all passengers were already in their cabins for the night.
Susato:
Yes!
Sholmes:
The overwhelming majority of passengers would habitually sleep with their cabin doors bolted anyway. And so not one of them would have found it remarkable to find the door locked in the morning. In summary... In order to fasten the bolt of a single cabin door on the ship... ...the culprit brought the entire vessel to an emergency stop in the early hours of the morning!
Susato:
...!
Hosonaga:
...!
Strogenov:
......... You have talked long time and said many things. What is point?
Sholmes:
The point is what I said earlier. There was somebody else present on the scene when the victim lost his life last night. Someone who left a message in Russian on the floor in an attempt to incriminate another. Someone who tried desperately to hide the broken fragments of glass that would reveal the culprit's identity. And someone who abused the ship's emergency stop procedure in order to lock a door. ...All told, a busy night.
Pavlova:
But...but... I...I don't know about any of this! I am just a little girl!
Strogenov:
You like to speak with your long English words and explain your clever ideas. But I am sailor. And sailors don't listen to long, boring stories. We don't believe. Sailors like me, we trust only what we see with our own eyes.
Sholmes:
......... A laudable trait.
Strogenov:
What?
Sholmes:
I am quite of the same disposition, my good man. Observation to me is everything. Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes?
Sholmes:
Do you hear it? That accusatory cry of guilt on the wind?
Susato:
What 'accusatory cry of guilt'...?
Ryunosuke:
S-Sorry, you've... You've lost me.
Sholmes:
Proof of involvement, man. But you can't hear such a call with your ears. No, you must hear it with your eyes! For observation is the basis of all deduction!
Strogenov:
What are you TALKING ABOUT?!
Sholmes:
I believe the time has come... ...for one final 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular' to expose the truth! So, Mr Naruhodo, your assistance, if you please!
Ryunosuke:
With what exactly, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
With observation, my dear fellow! Just as I said. Of these two prevaricators.
Ryunosuke:
Observation...?
Susato:
If you remember, Mr Naruhodo, we know that somebody tried to fabricate evidence, don't we? By tampering with the scene of Mr Asogi's death. What we're looking for is some trace of evidence that one of these two was there when it happened.
Sholmes:
Precisely! You are delightfully quick to grasp my meaning!
Ryunosuke:
Alright, I'll see what I can see! So we're looking for a trace of evidence that shows someone else was there last night when Kazuma died...
Examine chunky arms
Ryunosuke:
He has arms like tree trunks, doesn't he? Hairy tree trunks.
Susato:
Yes, he certainly has sailors' arms. He's a born man of the sea.
Ryunosuke:
(Even if I had been awake, I couldn't have done anything about being dragged out of that wardrobe by this man.)
Susato:
...Naruhodo-san? Are you alright? You seem to be lost in thought.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, sorry. Blame those hairy tree trunks.
Examine sailor's hat
Susato:
Have you noticed something significant about Seaman Strogenov's hat?
Ryunosuke:
Hm? Oh, no, sadly not. I was just thinking that if only we'd found it in Kazuma's cabin, it would all be so easy!
Susato:
That's true. A hat dropped at the scene would have been very conclusive evidence. ......... Ah, that's a point! I'm sure I saw your university uniform hat at the scene somewhere...
Ryunosuke:
...That is NOT 'a point'! At least, not one I'd like you to make.
Examine ink stain
Ryunosuke:
Oh, look at this! It's some kind of stain...in an unusual place.
Susato:
Yes, you're right. It looks like ink, if I'm not mistaken.
Ryunosuke:
Hm... Ink... And look at the colour, too. (It's clear where this came from!)
Present ink stain
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Seaman Strogenov..."
Present chunky arms
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Seaman Strogenov, those enormous arms of yours are thick with hair. And I have no doubt that in your struggle with the victim last night, handfuls of it would have come out! So...when I go now and search the floor in the victim's cabin, you'll have nowhere to run!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"How exactly are we supposed to show that someone else was there when Kazuma died?"
Present sailor's hat
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The truth is...I don't know exactly what trace of evidence this is going to unveil, but one thing is for sure... ...this man is definitely hiding something under his hat! When we remove it from his head, the revelations underneath will rock this boat...and the whole world!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"How exactly are we supposed to show that someone else was there when Kazuma died?"
Present right ear or left ear
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
I notice the dainty jewellery you're wearing on your ears, Miss Pavlova. Were we to find a piece of those earrings in Mr Asogi's cabin, it would prove beyond doubt that you were there! ...Although, we haven't actually found anything yet, so...
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"How exactly are we supposed to show that someone else was there when Kazuma died?"
Ryunosuke:
How exactly are we supposed to show that someone else was there when Kazuma died?
Susato:
I can think of two possible ways: Either we find a trace of something that the person in question left behind at the scene... ...or, if that's not possible...
Sholmes:
...A trace of something that the person took away from the scene, be that accidentally or deliberately.
Ryunosuke:
(A trace of something someone took away...?)
Sholmes:
If you observe closely enough, I believe you will find examples of both. Give them a long, hard and uncompromising stare from all sides, that's my advice!
Ryunosuke:
Seaman Strogenov... ...You seem to have quite a large purple stain on the back of your white uniform there.
Strogenov:
Eh? Ah, yes, I, um... I don't know where the dirt comes from...
Sholmes:
So nothing in particular comes to mind about the stain?
Strogenov:
What are you trying to say?
Sholmes:
It would appear that the significance of this stain has escaped your attention, Seaman. Allow us to make it plain!
Ryunosuke:
It's a very large purple stain on the back of Seaman Strogenov's uniform.
Susato:
And I think what made it is clear.
Sholmes:
Indeed it is. So, Mr Naruhodo, present the evidence that proves it!
Ryunosuke:
My pleasure! Alright then. The evidence that proves what that stain on the back of Seaman Strogenov's uniform really is...
Present Crime Scene Photograph
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Yes! It's this photograph, and the ink it shows!"
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Sholmes:
You know, it occurs to one occasionally, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Yes?
Sholmes:
...That a purple stain is perhaps caused...by something purple. Pray, what colour was the object you identified?
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (That was a gentlemanly way of telling me that I'm an idiot!)
Susato:
Oh, did Mr Sholmes upset you, Mr Naruhodo? Your face has turned almost purple!
Ryunosuke:
(Alright, I get the idea. I should be looking for something purple.)
Leads back to:
"So, the evidence that proves what that stain on the back of Seaman Strogenov's uniform really is..."
Ryunosuke:
Yes! It's this photograph, and the ink it shows! That's what caused the stain on your uniform!
Strogenov:
Ink?
Sholmes:
A rather unusual colour of ink, purple.
Strogenov:
Agh!
Sholmes:
Ah, the penny drops...at last. Now you see the significance.
Ryunosuke:
The Russian word on the floor next to the victim's body was written in purple ink. And the stain on the back of your uniform...is ink of exactly the same colour!
Sholmes:
If the ink had been dry, it couldn't possibly have stained your uniform in that way. Which means... ...you must have been present in the cabin in the moments immediately after the ink was spilt!
Strogenov:
......... Alright, yes. It was me. I did it. ...Everything.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Strogenov:
I arranged everything in dead student's cabin to make it look like wardrobe man did it. Then I pressed button to make Burya do emergency stop, and bolt cabin door shut. ...I did everything so no one would suspect our angel.
Pavlova:
Bif, please...
Strogenov:
Don't worry, angel. Let me do talking. It was after one in the morning. I was on duty, patrolling passageway. Then our angel came to me. She was white like sheet.
Pavlova:
'Bif! Please! You must help me!'
Strogenov:
I went with her. The door to cabin number one was open. When I looked inside...I saw student boy on floor.
Strogenov:
'Wha-What happened here?!'
Pavlova:
'......... Please...don't tell anyone... ...My little one... My little furry friend...'
Strogenov:
Everything that happened in cabin is like angel told you.
Ryunosuke:
The kitten escaped through the ventilator into Mr Asogi's cabin... Then he tripped over it and broke his neck when he fell to the floor?
Strogenov:
...Yes. That is right.
Hosonaga:
So after the incident when the cat ran away, Miss Pavlova then visited the cabin next to hers?
Sholmes:
Only to find its occupant lying lifeless on the floor.
Strogenov:
She said she was worried when she heard sound of something falling on floor. That's when she went to look. ...No, angel?
Pavlova:
.........
Strogenov:
The door was not locked. So she opened to look, and...you already know what happened after.
Pavlova:
.........
Susato:
There's just one thing...if you wouldn't mind?
Strogenov:
What?
Susato:
When you went to Mr Asogi's cabin, Miss Pavlova... ...was he...already dead?
Pavlova:
Why...?
Strogenov:
I already told you! When Nina opened door of student's cabin and looked inside-
Susato:
I was asking Miss Pavlova.
Strogenov:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Well, Miss Pavlova?
Pavlova:
......... ...Дa...
Susato:
Oh...
Pavlova:
Yes...that is right. I saw him... It was dark, and he was wearing black, but... He was on the floor. ...Not moving... I was scared... .........
Susato:
......... I understand. And...I believe you.
Ryunosuke:
(So is that finally it now? Have we discovered the real truth about Kazuma's death at last?)
Sholmes:
Ah! Something very nearly slipped my mind!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
This photograph... Yes, I took this myself, you know. The cause of death was a broken neck. Therefore, the victim died instantly. And the unfortunate incident that precipitated these events? A kitten, on which the victim stumbled. ...However, if those are the facts, there is one particular area in this photograph... ...that seems to me somewhat unnatural.
Strogenov:
What do you mean, 'unnatural'?
Sholmes:
What are your thoughts on the matter, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Hm? ...Oh! Well... (If Kazuma tripped and fell, and by some terrible stroke of bad luck broke his neck... ...which part of this photographic print seems unnatural?)
Present fist
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Alright, if he really fell due to an unfortunate accident..."
Present Russian word
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
This word in Russian clearly wasn't written by Kazuma. So if you're looking for something unnatural, that's the obvious point.
Sholmes:
Very true. It is certainly peculiar. But it's not what I meant by 'unnatural', I'm afraid. That particularly crass detail was orchestrated by the culprit. I mean to identify another point.
Susato:
Oh...I see.
Sholmes:
Imagine, if you will, losing your footing yourself. In my opinion, if you landed as the victim appears to have done here, it would be most unnatural. I'm sure you'll reach the same conclusion!
Susato:
How thoughtful you are, Mr Sholmes! Thank you for your gentle guidance!
Leads back to:
"If Kazuma tripped and fell, and by some terrible stroke of bad luck broke his neck..."
Present anywhere else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
It must be here! ...Surely.
Sholmes:
Allow me to offer you a piece of advice regarding the pursuit of detection, my dear fellow. When noting a crucial point, it can be helpful to keep your eyes open.
Ryunosuke:
Um...they were open.
Sholmes:
And...it can be equally helpful to use them.
Ryunosuke:
......... Sorry. ...I'll try that.
Susato:
I think it's plain what Mr Sholmes means by 'unnatural', isn't it? The word written in a foreign language underneath his fingertip, surely...
Sholmes:
That particularly crass detail was orchestrated by the culprit. No, I mean to identify another point. Imagine, if you will, losing your footing yourself. Would you land as the victim has? What of your hands? You look like the sort of fellow who stumbles with some regularity. This should be an easy task!
Ryunosuke:
(Why do I?!)
Leads back to:
"If Kazuma tripped and fell, and by some terrible stroke of bad luck broke his neck..."
Ryunosuke:
Alright, if he really fell due to an unfortunate accident... ...then this fist just doesn't seem quite right.
Sholmes:
...The exact same thought occurred to me. In a fall, one's instinct is to open the palms flat. Yet here we see the victim with his left hand tightly balled into a fist. Almost, you might say... ...as though he were gripping something.
Pavlova:
...!
Strogenov:
...What do you mean?
Sholmes:
Simply that I took the liberty... ...of investigating the victim's fist a short while ago.
Ryunosuke:
You did?!
Sholmes:
And what, pray, do you imagine I found there... my dear fellow?
Susato:
Mr Sholmes... Show us! Please!
Sholmes:
Why of course, my dear madam. Would I keep you in suspense? This is what I found.
Susato:
Oh, a crescent moon with a little gemstone in the middle?
Hosonaga:
Yes, you're right. A crescent moon. It's very pretty, but what does it tell us?
Strogenov:
Hmph. It tells us nothing!
Ryunosuke:
(I'm not so sure. That crescent moon looks... It looks familiar somehow. I'm sure I've seen it somewhere before.)
Sholmes:
Observation, Mr Naruhodo. That is the key.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Sholmes:
The truth is now tantalisingly close.
Susato:
...!
Ryunosuke:
(How did that crescent moon come to be in Kazuma's clenched fist...?)
Sholmes:
This is the final clue. The last piece of the puzzle! Ask yourself, what does this little crescent moon mean? What significance has it? And observe! Find the answer with your own eyes!
Examine chunky arms
Ryunosuke:
He has arms like tree trunks, doesn't he? Hairy tree trunks.
Susato:
Yes, he certainly has sailors' arms. He's a born man of the sea.
Ryunosuke:
(But it's hard to see how they could be anything to do with that little crescent moon.)
Susato:
Sometimes, things are relevant in ways that it's hard to imagine. Perhaps you should check?
Ryunosuke:
No, these are just tree trunks, nothing more. (We should be looking elsewhere, I think.)
Examine sailor's hat
Susato:
Have you noticed something about Seaman Strogenov's hat, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Hm? Oh, no. I don't think it can tell us much. I was just...practising my observation.
Susato:
Well, I don't imagine we're going to find anything to do with the crescent moon under it, do you?
Ryunosuke:
No, you're right. (Let's look elsewhere.)
Examine ink stain
Ryunosuke:
So he got this from the ink that was spilt on the floor.
Susato:
Yes, presumably when he was trying to arrange the scene to incriminate you.
Ryunosuke:
Did you see his face when I pointed it out before? He turned this colour himself, he was so angry!
Susato:
...If he had really turned this colour, I think he would have been ill, not angry.
Ryunosuke:
(Well anyway, I don't think this is relevant here.)
Examine left ear
Susato:
She has such petite ears among that beautiful hair. Like little pink shells.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, what's that? There's something dangling down from her ear.
Susato:
Yes, that's an 'earring'. Wait... Look! It's a crescent moon!
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (There can be no doubt now, surely!)
Present right ear
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Miss Pavlova, I notice that on your ear... ...even though you have a metal earring, the decorative part of it seems to be missing. The little link holding it on must have broken, I suppose.
Strogenov:
Eh? What?!
Ryunosuke:
But looking at your other ear... ...I notice a crescent moon.
Hosonaga:
Ah!
Strogenov:
I don't believe it!
Pavlova:
.........
Leads to:
"Now, the missing crescent moon was found in the victim's clenched fist."
Present left ear
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Miss Pavlova, on your ear there... ...I see you have a crescent moon as well.
Hosonaga:
Ah!
Strogenov:
What?!
Pavlova:
.........
Ryunosuke:
And on your other ear... ...there seems to be a crescent moon missing. The little link holding it on must have broken, I suppose.
Leads to:
"Now, the missing crescent moon was found in the victim's clenched fist."
Present chunky arms
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Sometimes I really don't understand myself. I know this is completely wrong, but I'm still going to say it anyway... Eventually I'll hit on the truth, though! It's only a matter of time!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"My dear fellow, we are in the final furlong."
Present sailor's hat
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Sometimes I frighten myself with the things I do. I know there's no way this can be relevant, but I'm making a case for it anyway... I blame the chicken I had last night.
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"My dear fellow, we are in the final furlong."
Present ink stain
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Sometimes things surprise you. That's why I'm going to say this is what we're looking for, even though I think it's almost certainly irrelevant! The real mystery here is what makes us do what we do, after all!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"My dear fellow, we are in the final furlong."
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, we are in the final furlong. It's too late for words of advice!
Susato:
The crescent moon is the last clue that Kazuma-sama left for us. And I believe it tells us everything!
Ryunosuke:
(So all that remains is for me to find out how. The answer must be here somewhere! I just need to look at this from all angles...)
Sholmes:
Now, the missing crescent moon was found in the victim's clenched fist. ...Clearly there is only one logical conclusion. Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
...Yes. Miss Pavlova... Mr Asogi must have grasped that crescent moon and pulled it from your ear. Perhaps just moments before he fell to the floor.
Pavlova:
...!
Ryunosuke:
In other words... ...last night, in Mr Asogi's cabin, you witnessed the moment when the victim fell with your own eyes. In fact, you were quite literally at arm's length from him.
Strogenov:
.........
Ryunosuke:
But then the question is, why did Mr Asogi do that? Why did he pull your earring from your ear, and hold it in his clenched fist during his final moments?
Pavlova:
Oh no...
Strogenov:
Angel...?
Ryunosuke:
No one can protect you now. Please, Miss Pavlova, tell us the truth. Last night... ...WHAT did you do to Kazuma?!
Pavlova:
Agh!
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeт!
When I think about everything that happened yesterday... It, it was too much. Running away...the fishing boat in the middle of the night...trying to climb onto this huge ship... And then... ...when I was at last in this cabin and I could relax after this horrible, long day...
MIAOOOOOW!!!
Darka! Wait!
......... I couldn't believe it when she disappeared through the...the ventilator. I tried to call her with...a little whistle... I, I tried waving her favourite toy... But nothing worked. Darka would not come back.
*Knock knock*
.........
*Clunk*
What are you doing here at this time of night, Inspector?
Kazuma:
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it was a friend of mine.
The young man from your country, he was very polite. And kind. He helped me to find Darka. And...he promised not to tell anyone. But then...when I had my friend in my arms again and I was going to leave the man's cabin...
Just a moment! Sorry, but...
Pavlova:
Oh... Yes?
Kazuma:
I'm sure I know your face. I've seen you somewhere before...
Pavlova:
Ah!
Kazuma:
Ah, of course! You're Nikolina Pavlova, aren't you? The Russian ballerina.
Pavlova:
Huh? N-No! I, I don't know that name.
My heart nearly stopped when he said that. He knew who I was! How could this man from a land in the faraway East know a Russian ballerina?!
Kazuma:
Yes, I saw your performance in Japan. The beauty of the ballet made a deep impression on me. But...what are you doing on this ship? I'm sure I read that your ballet company was performing in Shanghai at the moment.
'...I can't fool him. ...I have to tell him the truth, and hope he doesn't tell anyone. I have no other choice.'
Kazuma:
Hm, I see... So you've run away...
Pavlova:
Please! Please keep my secret! Don't tell anyone!
Kazuma:
Give me a moment. I could use another opinion here...
'...He's going to pull that cord! He's going to tell the captain! Why did I think I could trust him?!' Then it happened... Everything at once... It was only a second, but...it felt like forever... 'Wait!' I shouted. And then...
MIAOOOOOW!!!
Darka jumped out of my arms and down to the young man's feet. And... ...as he turned around to look at me... ...I, I pushed him! I don't even know why! I don't know why I did it! I, I was just so scared! And... ...I had to stop him from telling anyone about me.
Ryunosuke:
......... And that's when you went to fetch help? From Seaman Strogenov, who was on duty out in the passageway.
Strogenov:
I heard Nina cry out, and thud on floor. So I ran to her. She was standing at cabin door, shaking like leaf. She looked at me and said:
Help me, Bif! If they find out, I will be... Please! I have nowhere to go!
Ryunosuke:
So you decided to help. And that's when you arranged things in Kazuma's cabin to make it look like I did it... ...so that no one would suspect the passenger in the cabin next door?
Strogenov:
...Yes. I went into cabin and I looked around...to make sure there was nothing to show Nina was there. And then I found stowaway. In wardrobe. Still sleeping.
Ryunosuke:
(Right. That's when he found me.)
Susato:
So you worked out a plan. To lay the blame on the stowaway.
Strogenov:
......... I closed wardrobe doors and put back strange paper sign.
Ryunosuke:
(Luckily for me. That's the only reason Susato-san started to believe me when I said I was innocent.)
Strogenov:
I dragged young man's body to good place, and used ink that was spilling to write on floor. I wrote 'ГАРДЕРОБ' so that person who found him would look inside wardrobe and find stowaway.
Sholmes:
And tell me, what of the glass bell?
Pavlova:
It was by my feet, so I picked it up.
Sholmes:
I see.
Pavlova:
But it was dark in the cabin. I didn't notice the other half.
Strogenov:
Then angel went back to her cabin, and I finished job.
Ryunosuke:
By pressing the emergency alarm button in the passageway?
Strogenov:
...Yes.
Sholmes:
Accordingly, the SS Burya did indeed come to an emergency halt at a little after 2 a.m. Thus enticing the bolt on the cabin door to slide shut, creating the locked room mystery.
Strogenov:
.........
Ryunosuke:
There's still one thing I don't understand, Miss Pavlova.
Pavlova:
What?
Ryunosuke:
Well, you said that you told Kazuma about the fact that you'd run away from your homeland. And it's because you were worried he was going to tell the captain that you pushed him. ...Isn't that right?
Pavlova:
Yes...
Ryunosuke:
But even if he had pulled the bell cord and called for the captain of the ship... ...aren't you friends with every member of the crew? Why would that have been a problem?
Pavlova:
......... It was what he said first. That made me scared.
Ryunosuke:
What he said first?
What are you doing here at this time of night, Inspector?
Kazuma:
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it was a friend of mine.
Pavlova:
He said an inspector...was his friend...
Hosonaga:
Ah! Yes, meaning me... ...who was supposed to be acting as his bodyguard...
Pavlova:
I thought that if police knew about me...they would arrest me. ......... So before he could pull the bell cord, I, I...
Susato:
May I stop you a moment, please, Miss Pavlova?
Pavlova:
...!
Susato:
It just...doesn't seem to make sense. I mean, was Mr Asogi really going to pull the bell cord? I don't know...
Pavlova:
Wha...?
Susato:
What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
......... Well, I'm not Kazuma, so I can't know for certain. But... ...he was a man of his word. If he told you he wouldn't give your secret away, then he wouldn't have done.
Pavlova:
No! He, he was walking over to it! He was going to pull the cord! He was going to make them send me back...
Sholmes:
Well, Mr Naruhodo... ...the day's work is not yet done, it seems. There is one more deduction to make.
Ryunosuke:
What? Another deduction?
Sholmes:
Yes. What action was the victim really about to take at that moment? Can we determine whither the young man's gaze was directed? First, consider the victim's location within his cabin.
Ryunosuke:
That's easy. I remember every detail of that room. I mean, yes, I spent quite a lot of time in the wardrobe, but still... ...that cabin has been my home for this entire voyage.
Susato:
So this is how the cabin looked last night, when Miss Pavlova visited Kazuma-sama?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It's exactly how it was.
Sholmes:
Are you ready then, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! (If there's one thing I've learnt today... ...it's that a simple gaze can reveal all manner of truths. And not only that. In order to draw the right conclusion... ...you can't afford to be out by even a little bit when you're following the gaze to where it lands.) So, when he turned away from Miss Pavlova, what exactly was Kazuma looking at?
Examine bell cord
Ryunosuke:
(Hm...the bell cord... So Miss Pavlova thought that he was just coldly ignoring her request... ...and going to pull the cord... But the Kazuma I knew would never have done something like that. No, I'm sure of it. .........)
Examine bed
Ryunosuke:
(Hm, his bed... I remember him being annoyed about the pillow. He said it was too thin. Didn't he put that big, thick book of Japanese law underneath it, in fact? Perhaps he was thinking of looking something up. Either that, or talking to Miss Pavlova made him acutely tired...)
Examine wardrobe
Ryunosuke:
(Hm, the wardrobe... MY wardrobe... I was in there at the time, of course. Sleeping soundly. Too soundly. If only I hadn't eaten that chicken that was laced with the sleeping drug... If only he'd woken me up... ...then maybe this tragedy would never happened.)
Present wardrobe
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Considering everything that had happened last night..."
Present bell cord
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma really wasn't the kind of man to ignore an earnest plea like that. It wouldn't have been at all like him to call the inspector when you'd asked him not to. But looking at this scene now...it's hard to see what possible other explanation there could be...
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo... ...the truth is absolute. You cannot see someone look one way, but follow their gaze another!
Ryunosuke:
Haah... Sorry. I, I had a feeling it was wrong.
Sholmes:
From where I'm standing, it was quite wrong. You appear to be out by a fair margin. ...Actually, no! You were out by a mile!
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... Sorry...
Leads to:
"No one knows the workings of a man's mind better than his greatest friend, surely?"
Present bed
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma had placed a large book of law underneath his pillow. I believe he was going to consult that book in order to find a way to help you. ...Although I'm not quite sure how Japanese law would have been relevant, but still...
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo... ...the truth is absolute. You cannot see someone look one way, but follow their gaze another!
Ryunosuke:
Haah... Sorry. I, I had a feeling it was wrong.
Sholmes:
From where I'm standing, it was quite wrong. You appear to be out by a fair margin. ...Actually, no! You were out by a mile!
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... Sorry...
Leads to:
"No one knows the workings of a man's mind better than his greatest friend, surely?"
Sholmes:
No one knows the workings of a man's mind better than his greatest friend, surely?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I knew him well. At the very least, I'm convinced of one thing: Kazuma wouldn't have just called a crewman or the captain in that situation.
Susato:
According to Miss Pavlova, Kazuma's exact words were: 'I could use another opinion here.'
Ryunosuke:
(Whose opinion was he hoping for? I feel sure I ought to know...) 
Ryunosuke:
Considering everything that had happened last night... ...certainly it may have looked as though Kazuma was going to ring the bell cord.
Sholmes:
Yes. However... ...what is directly beside the bell cord? The wardrobe.
Pavlova:
The...wardrobe...?
Sholmes:
And, more importantly, what was inside the wardrobe? The man's great friend. Sleeping soundly.
Pavlova:
Ah!
Susato:
Miss Pavlova, please, think back very carefully. What were Mr Asogi's exact words last night?
Give me a moment. I could use another opinion here...
Pavlova:
'Another opinion'...
Sholmes:
Yes, but not from a member of the crew. No, Mr Asogi intended to consult his close friend on the matter. To see if, between them, they might be able to help in some way, no doubt.
Pavlova:
Oh no...
Susato:
Sadly, we can't know the truth for certain now. It's too late for that. But I wish you had made sure of what Mr Asogi was looking at. Things may have ended very differently if you had.
Pavlova:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Miss Pavlova... I want to thank you for finally admitting the truth. But, unfortunately... ...the truth is, a man lost his life because of what you did. And that will never change. I hope you'll never forget that.
Pavlova:
I'm sorry... Really... I'm so, so sorry... What have I done...
And so, at long last... ...the mystery surrounding the tragic accident on the SS Burya... ...was finally laid to rest.
9th January, 7:14 p.m.
SS Burya, First-Class Cabin Passageway
Ryunosuke:
What will happen to Miss Pavlova now then?
Hosonaga:
Once we reach Great Britain, she'll be handed over to the British police at Scotland Yard.
Ryunosuke:
What about the fact that she ran away from Russia? Won't the Russians try to repatriate her?
Hosonaga:
Apparently the English detective can speak to the immigration office and sort all that out.
Ryunosuke:
(Mr Sholmes can do that...?) So she won't be going back to Russia, then?
Hosonaga:
No, I don't think so. Even if she wanted to return in the future, I doubt she would be able to. She ran away, so now she's an exile for life.
Ryunosuke:
I see...
Strogenov:
I'm sorry...
Ryunosuke:
Seaman Strogenov?
Strogenov:
I wanted to help our angel. No matter what. But...I didn't think about you. About how you lost good friend. I will go with Nina. I will give myself to British police.
Ryunosuke:
...That's kind of you. In the meantime...thank you for letting me go free again. Kazuma's death...feels like such a waste. But... Well...do what you can for Miss Pavlova, won't you?
Strogenov:
Da.
Hosonaga:
Well, I'm afraid you need to pack now. We're due to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow. As much as it pains me... ...I'm going to have to hand you over to the consul to arrange your passage back to Japan.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes. (I did stow away, after all. I couldn't really expect any different.)
Hosonaga:
So, you should get back to your cabin now.
Ryunosuke:
(It looks like my study tour to Great Britain is over before it's even begun, then. To think that only days ago, Kazuma and I were laughing together about how we'd tear up the streets of London... That seems like a distant memory now.) ......... Oh...what's that? (Is it...someone weeping?)
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
...Susato-san?
Susato:
...! Naruhodo-san! I, I didn't know you had returned.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, erm, well...I haven't been back long. Inspector Hosonaga just told me I should pack. You know...ready to leave the ship tomorrow and all that.
Susato:
......... ......... I still...can't believe this has happened. I can't believe someone's life can be over, just like that.
Ryunosuke:
Susato-san...
Susato:
He had such grand ideas for this visit to Great Britain. So many dreams. And now they've been cruelly taken away. ...Just as he has. I thought I could never forgive the person responsible. But now... ...now we know the truth. That it was just an accident. Just a silly series of mishaps. It's too much, Naruhodo-san. It's just too much...
Ryunosuke:
......... Yes, I know.
???:
I wish there was something...I could say...
Susato:
Inspector...
Hosonaga:
My duty was to see Asogi-san safely to Great Britain. But I failed. And caused his two closest friends great pain and suffering as a result. I've let everyone down. And I will do ANYTHING to make up for my terrible blunder!
Ryunosuke:
...Nobody blames you, Inspector. And I'm free again now, at leas- Huh?
Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
Surprised, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
What...is the meaning of this?!
Sholmes:
Oh, a trifling matter. Simply that in my head, I think I shall always picture you wearing those shackles. Without them, the balance seems all wrong. It's...distracting.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
So I decided to restore them. For old times' sake, shall we say? You are a stowaway, after all. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
Ryunosuke:
(He thinks this is funny?!)
Susato:
Mr Sholmes... We do appreciate all your assistance. I'd like to thank you...from the bottom of my heart.
Sholmes:
Not at all, not at all. And though it's a little late, may I offer my sincere condolences? The loss of your companion is truly heartrending. I hope that you will be able to fulfil some of his aspirations in his honour.
Hosonaga:
I'm afraid that won't be possible. We shall be disembarking at the next port. In Hong Kong. We have to return to Japan and make a full report about everything that's happened.
Ryunosuke:
What? Wait a minute! It's just me that has to go back, isn't it? I mean, I was the stowaway!
Susato:
.........
Hosonaga:
The terms of this study tour were negotiated by the Department of Justice in both Great Britain and Japan. It was to be one lawyer and one assistant.
Ryunosuke:
'Was to be'?
Hosonaga:
In the light of Mr Asogi's unfortunate death... ...I'm afraid the study tour can no longer go ahead.
Ryunosuke:
(Oh no. I don't care for me, but... ...poor Susato-san.)
???:
My dear fellows, the majority of problems have an extremely simple solution, you know!
Sholmes:
All you require is one lawyer, and the study tour can continue, surely?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Susato:
But there is no one else with the necessary qualifications, Mr Sholmes. We know of no other lawyer.
Sholmes:
Qualifications, you say? Any qualifications obtained in your own country will be of little value in Great Britain, I'm afraid.
Susato:
Oh, but...
Sholmes:
But anyway, the voyage to London still promises a good month of time. Ample opportunity, I would say, to find yourselves another suitable lawyer.
Susato:
...Yes...
Ryunosuke:
......... Um...Miss Susato?
Susato:
Yes?
Ryunosuke:
Do you think perhaps...I might be able to do it?
Susato:
Ah!
Hosonaga:
But you're not a lawyer, Mr Naruhodo. Oh, unless... Are you studying law?
Ryunosuke:
No, I'm not, but-
Hosonaga:
I'm sorry. In that case, I don't think there's even a chance it could work.
Sholmes:
But as I said, there is still more than a month before we reach England's shores. Isn't that right, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I have a month in which to study! To learn what I must to become a lawyer in Great Britain.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo...
Hosonaga:
That's ridiculous! Are you seriously suggesting anybody could learn all of that in just forty days?
Ryunosuke:
There's only one way to find out! I would work my fingers to the bone, Inspector. Every single day. ...Will you let me try? And if, by the time we reach Great Britain, I haven't learnt enough to be recognised as a lawyer... ...I'll take whatever punishment is deemed appropriate.
Hosonaga:
But...why put yourself in such a difficult position?
Ryunosuke:
For Kazuma. He said that there was something he had to do in Great Britain. And that he would sacrifice anything to make it happen.
Susato:
...!
Ryunosuke:
He was passionate about it. I can't let all that passion just come to nothing. And anyway, it's for my own benefit, too. I will become a lawyer. I have to. ...What do you say, Miss Susato?
Susato:
......... ...I think it's a wonderful idea.
Ryunosuke:
(Thank you...)
Sholmes:
So...what does our bespectacled inspector friend say?
Hosonaga:
Are you serious?
Sholmes:
One lawyer and one assistant. The numbers are indisputable.
Hosonaga:
No no no! It's madness!
Sholmes:
Yet fascinating, wouldn't you agree?
Hosonaga:
'Fascinating'?
Sholmes:
Duty and rules are the dull routine of existence that we all abhor. Give us interest! Give us fascination!
Hosonaga:
Speak for yourself!
Sholmes:
Besides... ...qualifications are no measure of a man. What matters is his character...no?
Hosonaga:
...!
Sholmes:
And you've witnessed ample evidence of this man's exemplary character today with your own eyes. From the early hours of this morning until this very moment now. Despite contending with the passing of his close companion, and despite the accusation of guilt... ...this man has shown resourcefulness, intelligence and above all, courage.
Hosonaga:
......... Very well. I'll think of a clever way to word my report to the Department of Justice.
Ryunosuke:
Inspector!
Hosonaga:
After all, I did just make a promise, didn't I? I said that I'd do anything at all to make up for my shortcomings here.
Susato:
Oh, thank you, Inspector!
Hosonaga:
If you'll excuse me, I must pay a visit to the captain's quarters, I think. I need to discuss what to do next, and how best to make my report.
Susato:
Are you really prepared to attempt this, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I'm going to try. I wonder... ...would you consider teaching me what I need to know? Everything about being a lawyer?
Susato:
......... I would be delighted to help you! I AM a judicial assistant, after all!
Ryunosuke:
Thank you!
Susato:
And...Mr Naruhodo... ...I'd like you to take charge of this.
Ryunosuke:
What? Me?! ...Are you sure?
Susato:
I'm sure it's what Kazuma-sama would have wanted. Its name is 'Karuma'. It's a great sword, that's been in the Asogi clan for generations.
Ryunosuke:
...Very well, I accept. I'll treasure it always. So then, Miss Susato... ...it seems we'll be working together for some time to come yet!
Susato:
It will be an honour, Mr Naruhodo. And for the next forty days, I shan't grant you a single minute of freedom. We shall fill every spare moment with study!
Ryunosuke:
Yes! That's exactly what I need!
Susato:
But...before we begin... I have an earnest favour to ask of you, too.
Ryunosuke:
Goodness. ...What is it?
Susato:
......... Please throw me to the ground. Three times!
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
Susato:
I should never have doubted you. You were Kazuma-sama's closest friend. Of course you would never have done anything to hurt him. That should have been obvious to me from the start. But I allowed suspicion to get the better of me. And no matter how upset I was feeling...it was completely unforgivable behaviour.
Ryunosuke:
No! No, you were in shock. You'd just found out about me stowing away. And the cabin door was locked from the inside-
Susato:
No! I won't let you make excuses for me! Whatever the circumstances, I should never have thrown you! And not just once, but FIVE times!
Ryunosuke:
Haah... (That number keeps creeping up, doesn't it?)
Susato:
Please, you must! Just take hold of me and throw me! Do it! Don't even think about it!
Ryunosuke:
No no no! I don't even know how! I've never thrown anyone in my life!
Sholmes:
Very wise, Mr Naruhodo. It isn't a skill one acquires without considerable training.
Susato:
Oh, Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
I observed your throwing technique several times with great interest. I confess I was most impressed.
Ryunosuke:
(When did he see that?)
Sholmes:
I presume that would be a form of Japanese wrestling?
Susato:
Oh, well...in a way. It's not wrestling, but my own interpretation of an ancient jujutsu technique.
Ryunosuke:
Apparently it's called the Susato Takedown. It leaves your head swimming, believe me.
Sholmes:
Hm... How beguiling... I am a practitioner of the combative arts myself. I am a somewhat accomplished boxer.
Ryunosuke:
(There he goes, dancing around again...)
Sholmes:
I wonder if you'd be so kind as to instruct me on the technique of your arresting throw?
Susato:
......... Yes! I'd be honoured!
Sholmes:
Then let us not dally! Demonstrate, my dear madam!
Susato:
Oh! Of, of course! Are you ready, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
Haiiiiii-YA! ...As you can see, you throw from the abdomen.
Sholmes:
Oh yes, arresting indeed! And that is what you term the Susato Takedown, is it?
Susato:
Actually, no. That was a Susato Squash!
(In my groggy state of consciousness... ...a scene from an evening recently spent with Kazuma flickered into my mind...)
Ryunosuke:
...'Karuma'...?
Kazuma:
That's right. It's a prized sword that's been passed down through generations of the Asogi clan.
Ryunosuke:
I can't believe you managed to get permission to bring it with you! I mean, taking a katana on a study tour is more than a little irregular, surely?
Kazuma:
A Japanese man's sword is his soul, Ryunosuke. I can't be parted from my katana. Karuma guides me. I truly believe that.
Ryunosuke:
So its name compels its wielder to slice evil in two? Not that you would need much compelling...
Kazuma:
On that subject... ...there's something very important that I have to do in Great Britain. And I'll sacrifice anything to make it happen. I'd appreciate you seeing it through with me.
Ryunosuke:
Of, of course I will. Whatever it is, I'll see it through to the end with you.
Kazuma:
...I knew you wouldn't let me down.
(That important thing he had to do... I still don't know what that was. But I'm going to see the place for myself and work it out. In Great Britain's capital...London.)
End
Examine insignificant area on evidence
Ryunosuke:
I can't find anything out of place.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Ryunosuke:
I've investigated thoroughly, but... I can't find anything out of place.
Presenting wrong evidence during Logic and Reasoning Spectacular
Ryunosuke:
Sholmes:
What precisely was your intention with that, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Just following the natural progression of the deduction! Sometimes the truth hurts!
Sholmes:
Well, the truth is, you do not have a turn for observation or deduction. ...Did that hurt?
Ryunosuke:
Yes... A lot...
Presenting wrong evidence during Logic and Reasoning Spectacular
Ryunosuke:
Sholmes:
What spectacularly contrived logic led you to this mindless conclusion?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, well, um...it's supposed to be a 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular', so...I thought I'd contribute to the show!
Sholmes:
This is my show, Mr Naruhodo. Kindly perform any peculiar experiments on your own stage.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... Sorry.
Presenting wrong evidence during Logic and Reasoning Spectacular
Ryunosuke:
Sholmes:
That 'deduction' was wanting in every way.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I was wanting you to hear it. I'm quite proud of it!
Sholmes:
I find myself wanting never to have heard it. I'm quite pained by it, in fact.
Ryunosuke:
Oh... Sorry. I'll try again.
Too many errors during Logic and Reasoning Spectacular (during both Course Corrections)
Deduction Failed
I can see nothing.
Too many errors during Logic and Reasoning Spectacular (during chapter "Second Dance of Deduction")
Sholmes:
Hm... Sadly, Mr Naruhodo... ...despite being all about trifles, great deduction is no trifling matter. There is no place for guesswork.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... Sorry...
Sholmes:
I'm afraid you have developed a shocking habit for it. And it is quite destructive to the logical faculty. Reasoning is an art, and there are only so many times you can erase your work.
Ryunosuke:
(In other words, I need to think everything through again from the start...)
Susato:
Don't lose heart, Naruhodo-san. I believe in you. Those eyes of yours won't let you down. I'm sure they'll help you find the truth in the end!
Ryunosuke:
......... Right... I need to put trust in my own observational skills...
