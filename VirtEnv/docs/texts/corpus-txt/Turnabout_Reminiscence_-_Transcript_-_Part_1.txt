Episode 4Turnabout Reminiscence
Edgeworth:
Kay Faraday... the young lady who calls herself the second Yatagarasu... The piece of cloth that she conjured up has taken me back to many years ago...
-- 7 Years Earlier --
Defendant:
Yeah, that's right. I did it. I killed the guy. But it was the Great Thief Yatagarasu that told me to do it!
Objection!
Lawyer:
I ask the defendant... Just what exactly are you trying to say?
Defendant:
Don't you get it? I know the true identity of the Yatagarasu! ...The Yatagarasu is the man standing over there at the prosecutor's bench!
Prosecutor:
Are you saying... that I'm the Yatagarasu?
Defendant:
Don't you dare deny it! You told me to kill him when you snuck into the embassy!
Lawyer:
Are you claiming that Mr. Faraday is the Yatagarasu?
Defendant:
That's exactly what I'm saying!
Objection!
Prosecutor:
Mr. Rell! I think we've heard just about enough out of you...!
Defendant:
Your Honor! Please listen to me! I'm telling the truth... You've gotta believe meeeeeee!
Judge:
Hmph... In accordance with the defendant's accusation... ...a new prosecutor shall be called to replace Mr. Faraday. This court will be in recess until the new prosecutor is ready.
September 10, 3:20 PMDistrict Court3rd Floor Lobby
Examine evidence
Front of Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor... ...but my mentor has taught me that it's more fashionable to keep it in my pocket.
Edgeworth:
(...It's almost time for me to enter the courtroom. And so, it is that my first assignment as a prosecutor will be... ...as a replacement for a prosecutor who has been accused by the defendant.)
???:
Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
! ...Sir.
???:
Have you read over all of the documents regarding this trial?
Edgeworth:
Yes, sir. I've memorized everything there is to know.
Manfred:
Very good. The paperwork for the prosecutor substitution is just about complete. Edgeworth... always bear in mind that as your mentor, I, Manfred von Karma... ...will accept nothing short of perfection.
Edgeworth:
I understand, sir. To have the chance to stand in court at such an early stage in my career... ...I am honored and proud.
Manfred:
As I have watched over your studies, I am giving you this very rare chance. Prove yourself. Crush the defendant's pathetic lies into oblivion.
Edgeworth:
.........Yes, sir! (That such a legendary prosecutor is watching over and judging my performance... ...I have to perfect in every way!)
Door on left
Edgeworth:
This should lead to the defendant lobbies.
Manfred:
Edgeworth! Where is your composure!? If you wish to take a look at your enemy, do so in the courtroom... as you crush him.
Edgeworth:
...Indeed, thank you. You are a man of wisdom and experience, sir.
Bulletin board
Edgeworth:
(A bulletin board... There are trial schedules posted on it. Trials scheduled for this week... Huh? There's only today's trial listed... This must be a mistake, or this country's judicial system is not working as it should!)
Man drinking water
Man:
Th-This is so good! *gulp, gulp, gulp* I could drink a whole gallon!
Edgeworth:
(I've never heard of water that tastes THAT good...) .................. (Maybe I'll give him a minute...)
Man:
*gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp* *gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp* *gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp* *gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp* *gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp* *gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp*
Edgeworth:
(Does he plan on gulping an entire reservoir dry!?)
Old lady
Old Lady:
*sigh*
Edgeworth:
Excuse me, madam, but is something the matter?
Old Lady:
I just thought someone would have brought hors d'oeuvres by now...
Edgeworth:
B-But this is a courthouse! It would be quite atypical to provide hors d'oeuvres here!
Old Lady:
Are you sure? Someone poured me a fresh cup of coffee last night I was here.
Edgeworth:
(What the heck does she think a courthouse is for!?)
Door on center
Edgeworth:
(This trial is about to resume. I should stay on the premises.)
Bailiff on center door
Bailiff:
Mr. Prosecutor, sir!
Edgeworth:
You've got a good eye if you can tell that I'm a prosecutor with just one glance.
Bailiff:
As there are always only prosecutors and defense attorneys in this lobby... I usually hit the mark if I guess one or the other while there is a recess.
Edgeworth:
(You were only guessing!?)
Father and son
Father:
Aren't these great? Daddy made all of these.
Boy:
Awesome! But didn't you get fired right after you made them?
Father:
Ah, yeah I did... I spent the same amount of money on this model as it cost to build the real thing. And my boss wasn't very happy with me. Haha.
Boy:
Hey, Daddy. Didn't you say you built a secret mechanism inside of it?
Father:
Hahaha. I'll tell you about it someday when you're older.
Edgeworth:
(A secret mechanism...? Maybe he installed it as payback for getting fired? It could be trouble... ......Now I'm curious.)
Courthouse model
Edgeworth:
(A model of the courthouse. It's pretty well constructed. Hm...? Hands and a face...? Don't tell me this thing transforms... Yet, I wonder for what other purpose could they have been made...?)
Manfred von Karma
Manfred:
Today's trial should have ended in just one minute.
Edgeworth:
Because the defendant was picked up by the security camera, correct?
Manfred:
...Exactly. The killer had the gall to say that he only killed because he was instructed to do so. Even more outrageous is his claim that the case prosecutor. Byrne Faraday, gave the order. Hah! Faraday is such a fool! He's been cornered by his very own prey.
Edgeworth:
Sir... Are you an acquaintance of Mr. Byrne Faraday?
Manfred:
Hmph. He is a pathetic man who speaks nothing but nonsense.
Edgeworth:
Nonsense...?
Manfred:
He once tried to explain to me a way of punishing "those who cannot be brought to court".
Edgeworth:
"Those who cannot be brought to court"...? That IS nonsense, for no man is above the law.
Manfred:
Well... there are always a few exceptions. However, there is no reason to even deal with such individuals. A prosecutor is a guardian of the court, one with no obligation to outside matters.
Edgeworth:
(Thus, there is no reason to deal with such individuals, I see.)
Manfred:
Edgeworth... Disgracing yourself as Faraday has will not be forgiven.
Edgeworth:
Hace no fear. I will not let you down, sir. In place of the accused Prosecutor Byrne Faraday, I'll prove the defendant's guilt!
Manfred:
Very good. I've secured an hour of recess for you to prepare to do just that. Show them all... the power of Von Karma!
Today's trial
Manfred:
So, have you achieved a firm understanding of the case?
Edgeworth:
Yes, sir. I have memorized everything that is written down in the case files.
Manfred:
Well then, explain the case to me. ...I want to see if you really know what you are talking about.
Edgeworth:
Understood. A murder was committed on September 8th in front of the Cohdopian Embassy. The victim, Mr. Deid Mann, was a staff member at the embassy. The defendant in this case, Mr. Mack Rell... ...was held for questioning the night of the incident as he was deemed suspicious. He was quickly placed under arrested for possession of the murder weapon, a gun. Furthermore, at the time of the murder... ...the Great Thief "Yatagarasu" had successfully infiltrated the Cohdopian Embassy as well. At first, Rell claimed that he himself was the Yatagarasu... ...but that he did not kill Deid Mann. I wonder what he expected to gain from such a desperate lie?
Manfred:
It's possible that he wants to go down while in the spotlight, if he is found guilty. There truly is no limit to people's inanity... But I digress. Continue, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Yes, sir. During the trial, the prosecution presented the security footage that captured the murder... The footage clearly showed Mr. Rell as the murderer.
Manfred:
The act of Mr. Rell firing the gun could be clearly seen from the visitor's gallery.
Edgeworth:
Upon seeing that, the defendant retracted his statement and admitted to the murder. "I did it because I was told to... ...by the real Yatagarasu, Byrne Faraday."
Manfred:
...Hmm. That sounds about right. However, you've forgotten one thing.
Edgeworth:
!
Manfred:
While this may appear to simply be the murder of a Cohdopian Embassy staff member... ...people are actually referring to it as the second KG-8 Incident.
Edgeworth:
The second KG-8 Incident...? I'm very sorry, sir. I fear I've failed to study hard enough.
Manfred:
...Hmph. Well, even among the police, it's information that only a select few are privy to.
Edgeworth:
Could you please enlighten me, sir?
"2nd KG-8 Incident" (appears after Today's trial)
Edgeworth:
Sir... What do you mean by "the second KG-8 Incident"?
Manfred:
In order for me to tell you that, you must first learn about the original case. Take a look at these documents.
Edgeworth:
This is a... three-year-old newspaper.
KG-8 Incident Overview data jotted down in my Organizer.
Manfred:
You have heard of the Amano Group scandal before, correct?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I have. The secretary of Ernest Amano, the Amano Group's director, was arrested... ...under suspicion of smuggling.
Manfred:
Correct. Cece Yew was an employee of the Amano Group... ...and the sole witness to the smuggling operation. It was she who brought the crime to light. However, Ms. Yew was silenced before she could testify in court.
Edgeworth:
Wasn't a Cohdopian Embassy staff member arrested for the murder?
Manfred:
Yes... A Cohdopian by the name of Manny Coachen was the suspect. However, due to lack of evidence, the case went unresolved.
Edgeworth:
...Lack of evidence!?
Manfred:
Hah! If only I was in charge of the case. I would have done everything in my power to prove his guilt!
Edgeworth:
(To make sure that all criminals are found guilty... My mentor really is dedicated.)
Manfred:
Faraday was the prosecutor on the case then, and he was as pathetic as ever.
Edgeworth:
...! Mr. Faraday was in charge of the KG-8 Incident as well?
Manfred:
That's right. And now, once again, the victim of the case you are currently assigned to... ...was someone who was scheduled to testify against that smuggling organization.
Edgeworth:
...And just like last tome, the victim was murdered right before he was to testify.
Manfred:
You're catching on. The victim was murdered just before his day in court against the smuggling organization. Events are occurring almost exactly the same way as they did in the KG-8 incident.
Edgeworth:
So that's why it is being called the second KG-8 Incident?
Manfred:
Yes... Yet, there is one difference between the two incidents.
Edgeworth:
What would that be...?
Manfred:
The so-called noble thief that is sending everyone into an uproar... The Great Thief "Yatagarasu".
Edgeworth:
(Yatagarasu...? I'd better find out more.)
Yatagarasu (appears after "2nd KG-8 Incident")
Leads to:
"If it's true that the Yatagarasu showed up at the Cohdopian Embassy..."
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
It is thanks to you that i have finally become a prosecutor, sir.
Manfred:
It's amusing that you wanted to become a defense attorney, yet became my student. Hmph... It is a strange path you have traveled.
Edgeworth:
It's true that I had once wanted to become a defense attorney... But now, I am honored and proud to be a prosecutor.
Manfred:
I see. Then as a student of mine, I suggest you remember this well: The Prosecutor's Badge... is not to be flaunted! The dignity of a prosecutor lies in the man himself, not in the badge.
Edgeworth:
I understand... I will keep that in mind.
Manfred:
Besides, why put holes in your fine garments? It's simply preposterous!
Edgeworth:
Prosecutors must also take pride in their appearance... I will keep this in mind as well.
Manfred:
I'm constantly having to remind the others at the Prosecutor's Office of this... "It's more fashionable to keep your Prosecutor's Badge in your pocket!"
Edgeworth:
In other words, always treat a Prosecutor's Badge with care and honor? I understand, sir.
KG-8 Incident Overview
Edgeworth:
About the KG-8 Incident... The trial came to a proper conclusion, did it not?
Manfred:
Hah! I'd hardly call the defendant being found innocent! a "proper" conclusion! If I had been on the case, no one would have a single doubt about his guilt!
Edgeworth:
But, wasn't there a lack of evidence to prove that Mr. Coachen was guilty...?
Manfred:
...A lack of evidence? Hah! There is no such thing.
Edgeworth:
(That's just like him to be able to prove a man guilty, even when the evidence is lacking!)
Sofa
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. A luxurious and beautiful leather sofa. I must say, every part of this courthouse is meticulously well kept. Although, the positioning of this sofa puts one under the direct gaze of the judges. Every judge in this courthouse's history has had a quite the beard... ...and has gallantly parted with their beloved head of hair, I see. Being a judge must be a very stressful career.)
Bailiff on right up
Edgeworth:
(Egad...! What a cold stare he's giving me! However, as a disciple of Von Karma, there is no option but to win!) ..................!
Bailiff:
..................
Edgeworth:
(Nngh...... He's good! The power of his cold stare rivals my own!)
Bailiff:
..................zzz.
Edgeworth:
............! (He's sleeping while standing up!)
Door on right
Edgeworth:
(This trial is about to resume. I should stay on the premises.)
Bailiff on right down
Bailiff:
The trial will resume shortly. Please wait a moment, sir.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I was already well aware of that. (Shortly, or in a moment... Which one is it? Be specific!)
Bookshelf
Edgeworth:
A bookshelf, huh...? ("Compendium of Laws for Beginners"... I don't have the time to read this and second-guess myself now!)
Edgeworth:
If it's true that the Yatagarasu showed up at the Cohdopian Embassy... ...what could he or she have been better?
Manfred:
Hmph... No doubt to steal any suspicious accounting records and release them publicly. Or, more likely, to steal secrets from the Cohdopian Embassy itself... ...since the item that the Yatagarasu stole from there was sent to the police.
Edgeworth:
What was it that the Yatagarasu sent to the police?
Manfred:
...I don't know the details. Anything related to the Yatagarasu is getting the top-secret treatment. Still, I find it very ironic. By returning the stolen item to the police, it was proof positive that the Yatagarasu... ...had infiltrated the embassy on the same day the staff member was killed. Criminals have a way of incriminating themselves, wouldn't you say?
Edgeworth:
That would have to be the first time the Yatagarasu has left evidence behind, correct?
Manfred:
Yes, indeed. If you wish to learn more about the Yatagarasu, then I suggest you ask Faraday.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday...?
Manfred:
He happens to be the prosecutor in charge of the Yatagarasu case, as well.
Edgeworth:
(He's the prosecutor in charge of both the KG-8 Incident and the Yatagarasu case? Mr. Faraday really has a lot on his plate...)
Manfred:
...What is it, little girl?
???:
......... ...You're scary, mister.
Manfred:
!
Edgeworth:
Did you need something?
???:
Umm... I want to trade these coins with you!
Edgeworth:
A fistful of dimes, quarters, and pennies... but it looks like you've exactly a dollar. Is this what you want?
???:
Thanks! That's exactly what I needed!
Edgeworth:
Could that child be here to watch the trial?
Manfred:
How disrespectful for a child like that to be running around inside the courthouse! Does no one have respect for this country's judicial system anymore!?
Bailiff:
The paperwork for the prosecutor substitution is complete!
Manfred:
Why you! Do you even know how much time there is left before the trial resumes!?
Bailiff:
I... I-I'm so sorry!
Manfred:
I can have you mopping up this courthouse instead of protecting it in an instant!
Bailiff:
! *gulp*
Edgeworth:
It's no bother, sir. Not being completely prepared could prove to be a prefect handicap for me.
Manfred:
Hmph. A proud one you are. You had better collect the evidence from Faraday and prepare yourself. It's time for your debut, Edgeworth!

Manfred:
..................
Edgeworth:
..................
Manfred:
Just what is going on!? Why isn't Faraday here yet!? How is it possible that the defense is not prepared yet, either!?
Edgeworth:
Bailiff... Where is Mr. Faraday?
Bailiff:
I-I'm not sure... I wasn't really paying attention...
Judge:
Ah, you must be the one Mr. von Karma recommended... I hear this will be your first trial. I look forward to seeing how you perform. Oh, by the way, was there someone celebrating a birthday during the recess? I could have sworn that I heard a popper going off... Come to think of it... The other day with my grandson...
Edgeworth:
Sir, it looks like the trial is about to resume, however...
Manfred:
...Yes, it will be all but impossible to prove the witness a liar... ...without the evidence from Faraday! What is that balsted buffon up to!?
???:
I-I-It's an emergency, siiiiiirs!
Judge:
S-Silence!
Manfred:
There shall be no yelling in this sacred hall of law! Bailiff! Remove that man from this courtroom at once!
???:
P-Please... wait! You have to listen to me! There's an emergency! Defendant Lobby No. 2...! M-Mr. Faraday and the defendant... Th-The two of them... They're... They're both dead, Your Honor!
Judge:
Wh--!?
Manfred:
Wh--!?
Edgeworth:
Wh--!? Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
September 10District CourtHallway
???:
Stay back!
Edgeworth:
Ungh...!
???:
...No one's allowed on the crime scene... Period.
Edgeworth:
(Just who does this... oddball think he is...?)
???:
This is becoming quite the hotspot...
Edgeworth:
(Isn't she Mr. Rell's defense attorney...?)
???:
H-Hey, you! No running in the hallway, pal!
Edgeworth:
And who are you to tell me what to do? (I'll never find out what's going on like this. It's time for some civil discourse.)
Sofa
Edgeworth:
(This soda looks like it's seen its fair share of use. And it looks like another part of the courthouse is visible from the window... Ack! My eyes have locked with my reflection's eyes in the barred window! As a student of Von Karma, I refuse to back down!) ..................I won.
Detective
Edgeworth:
Excuse me, but... who are you?
Badd:
...Detective Tyrell Badd. ...Homicide.
Edgeworth:
I was informed of the situation and came as quickly as possible... ...so how did you arrive and inspect the body before me?
Badd:
...Faraday requested for me to testify in the trial... Plain and simple.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday requested that you be here...?
Crime scene
Badd:
I've already contacted HQ about the situation. I've... got nothing to say to you... kid.
Edgeworth:
(K-Kid!?) I'm Mr. Faraday's substitute in today's trial. Therefore, I insist that you update me on the situation!
Badd:
............
Edgeworth:
(I can't back down here. I have a right ot know.)
Badd:
...Do I need to teach you a thing or two about how to talk to adults, kid!?
Edgeworth:
! (Is he threatening me? I-Is he going for his gun!? I-It's just a mirror... How dare he trick me like that!?)
Badd:
...Faraday was stabbed to death with some kind of blade. And he had a gun in his hand. The other man, a Mr. Mack Rell, was shot and killed. He was found holding a bloody knife in this hand.
Edgeworth:
Was there anyone else who went into Defendant Lobby No. 2?
Badd:
Yeah, that big lug over there. His name's Gumshoe. He was in charge of guarding the place... He's claiming that no one else entered the room.
Edgeworth:
If that's the case, then... they must have killed each other, correct!?
Badd:
Maybe...
Edgeworth:
(Such impudence! This guy is really testing my patience!)
Trial witness
Edgeworth:
Why was I not informed that you were going to testify in court?
Badd:
...Homicides aren't my only gig; the Yatagarasu case is also one of my assignments.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... So you were called upon to comment on the Yatagarasu's characteristics... ...in order to assess if Mr. Faraday really was the Yatagarasu or not?
Badd:
Well, well... Looks like you just might have a brain after all in that head of yours, son.
Edgeworth:
(S-Son...!? I'm not your son, "pops"!)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Badd:
...Does showing that off make you feel like a big, strong prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
O-Of course not! I was simply proving my title of prosecutor to you.
Badd:
I see. But most prosecutors don't go around flaunting those tings... It's like a detective walking around outside with his badge flashing in the sunlight. ...Show that off too much, and before you know it, you'll be elbow-deep in angry criminals.
Edgeworth:
That would... definitely be a problem.
Anything else
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd... I'd like to ask you about this piece of evidence.
Badd:
..................
Edgeworth:
Could you please pay attention?
Badd:
Heh... I'm listening. But I've got nothing to say... End of story.
Edgeworth:
...Very well. (Why didn't you say that in the first place?)
Defense attorney
Edgeworth:
Do you have a minute?
???:
...You know, I'm not really into talking to people I don't know. Especially at a time like this.
Edgeworth:
Ah. I apologize for not introducing myself before bothering you. My name is Miles Edgeworth. I was to take Mr. Faraday's place in court.
???:
Edgeworth, huh...? Never heard of you. So Faraday's substitute is a newbie, huh?
Edgeworth:
I'll have you know, madam, that I studied under Manfred von Karma. Do not take me for some naïve novice.
???:
..................Phwwh!
Edgeworth:
...?
???:
...Mu...Phwwh. "Do not take me for some naïve novice"...!? Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha! So, you're a student of Von Karma! I should have... Phwwh...! Those clothes are a dead giveaway!
Edgeworth:
S-Stop right there! These are the garments of one who gallantly presents the facts...
???:
Phwwh... Ah, thanks for the great laugh, but try not to make me laugh so much, OK?
Edgeworth:
I wasn't trying to do anything of the sort!
Yew:
Ahaha! Just kidding! I was just goofing around! By the way, do you know who I am? My name is Calisto Yew. And if you're telling the truth... then we were about to go head-to-head in court.
Edgeworth:
Ah, but of course! I have heard much about you, Ms. Yew.
Yew:
Phwwh...! "Ah, but of course! I have heard much about you"... You're a regular Shakespeare!
Edgeworth:
(Did I say something funny...?)
Crime scene
Edgeworth:
I'd like you to update me on the situation.
Yew:
I don't really know anything. ...Why don't you try talking to those detectives over there?
Edgeworth:
If that's the case, then why are you here?
Yew:
Phwwh............ Ahahahahahaha!
Edgeworth:
Urgh! What's so funny!
Yew:
It's just that the way you speak is so tactless! The person I was going against in court until only a little while ago was just murdered. It's not like I could go back into the courtroom pretending as though nothing happened.
Edgeworth:
! ......That's a good point. I apologize for asking such an insensitive question.
Yew:
...It's fine. Don't worry about it.
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
It is a shame that we will not be able to face each other. It was to be my first trial, too.
Yew:
Oh, was that a declaration of war? How nice it is to be young and carefree. And what a nice squeaky clean badge you've got yourself there. I'm jealous!
Edgeworth:
I'm sure its gleam will dull over time with experience.
Yew:
Phwwh... Are you saying your reputation will also tarnish over time with it?
Edgeworth:
Nngh...! That's not what I meant!
Yew:
Phwwh! Well, you just can't avoid some things in life.
Edgeworth:
(I'll never allow my badge or my reputation to become tarnished.)
Anything else
Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew... What do you think about this piece of evidence?
Yew:
Actually Edgeworth, I'm interested in finding out what you think about it.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I don't really know all that much about it.
Yew:
Hmm... Then, I don't really know all that much about it, either.
Edgeworth:
..................
Yew:
...Phwwh! Ahahahahahaha! Sorry! Guess I can't be of any service!
Edgeworth:
(I shouldn't push her too much... She'll just start laughing again.)
Dick Gumshoe
Edgeworth:
And you are...?
???:
...Who, me? Hey, pal... ...it's common courtesy to tell someone your name first before asking their's!
Edgeworth:
Nngh...! Point taken. My name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a district prosecutor.
???:
A prosecutor? I've never seen a prosecutor as young as you, pal.
Edgeworth:
...I've told you my name. Now would you mind telling me yours?
Gumshoe:
Detective Dick Gumshoe! And just recently, I achieved my dream of becoming a detective! More than a dream... It's what I was born to do! Wait... Maybe I should check and make sure I'm not really in some crazy dream first...
Edgeworth:
(This detective is entirely too excited to be at a murder scene...)
Crime scene
Edgeworth:
So Detective Gumshoe... Would you mind telling me what you know about the incident?
Gumshoe:
You know that I don't have to tell you anything, right?
Edgeworth:
I know that. But it would behoove you to fill me in on what you know.
Gumshoe:
...Wow, you're a proud one for such a youngster, aren't you? Well, anyway, Detective Badd is the one in charge... ...so you're just gonna have to ask him for all the details, OK? As for me, I was guarding the door to Defendant Lobby No. 2.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... So you were the guard detail... Did you notice anything strange while you were on duty?
Gumshoe:
Well, I freaked out when I heard a gunshot, and then I kinda froze.
Edgeworth:
(You're a detective and a measly gunshot scared you that much? ......Then again, I can hardly claim to not know what it's like to hear one at close range...)
Gumshoe:
Then, Detective Badd came running to the scene. We went into Lobby No. 2 together, and both men were lying there, dead.
Edgeworth:
Is that everything?
Gumshoe:
Hmm......... Yeah, that's it. I was in the hallway the whole time, but I didn't hear a single peep of a struggle.
Edgeworth:
(Interesting... Other than the gunshot, he didn't hear a single sound of commotion.)
Det. Gumshoe's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
You mentioned that you've only recently become a detective, did you not?
Gumshoe:
You got it! I'm a brand spankin' new detective!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... So that means you've probably never seen a real Prosecutor's Badge, right? If you so desired to see one, I just might be able to make your day.
Gumshoe:
You don't have to go through the trouble, pal, because a real man has a police badge! And someday, I'm gonna become an Ace Detective, just like Detective Badd!
Edgeworth:
..................
Gumshoe:
Umm... Did I say something wrong, pal?
Edgeworth:
......... ...Forget it, Detective.
Det. Gumshoe's Testimony
Edgeworth:
So, you were guarding the door to Lobby No. 2 at the time of the crime, correct?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, that's right! And I'll have you know, not even a single ant got by me!
Edgeworth:
Really? Are you sure that not even a single ant slipped in?
Gumshoe:
Well, umm... I-I guess if we're talking about "slipped in", then maybe a frog or something did!
Edgeworth:
...It would appear that my point also completely slipped by you, Detective.
Anything else
Edgeworth:
Do you have any insight on this, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, well... As a detective I'd rather see something that is actually related to the case, pal!
Edgeworth:
(And here I thought this was related enough...)

(Defendant Lobby No. 1 is through here. The incident took place in Lobby No. 2 next door... I shouldn't allow myself to be sidetracked like this. I'd better get a move on.)
Poster
Edgeworth:
(A poster of the Judge. There's a slogan of some sort on it... ) "Every strike of my gavel brings the truth closer to me, and my hair farther away." .................. (Is this a promotional poster for the court or a hair growth product...?)
Fire extinguisher
Edgeworth:
(A fire extinguisher... If one were to be hit in the head with this... ...I suppose the victim would lose a memory or two. But it's not as though I'D ever be so foolish as to be struck by one of these.)
Door on down right
Edgeworth:
(First, I need to get a handle on the situation. Perhaps, I should talk to some people.)
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Bailiff:
Ms. Yew! There is someone here who wishes to see you...
Yew:
......Who is it?
Bailiff:
A Cohdopian Embassy staff member by the name of Manny Coachen.
Yew:
Wh--!
Badd:
.........!
Edgeworth:
(What's going on? Detective Badd and Ms. Yew's moods just changed all of a sudden. Wait a second... Wasn't Manny Coachen...!?)
Yew:
I'll be right there.
Coachen:
It's nice to see you again... Ms. Yew.
Yew:
Why are you here? I have no desire to ever see you again.
Coachen:
Now, now... Actually, would you mind stepping outside for a brief chat?
Yew:
........Fine. Let's go.
Manfred:
...Badd.
Badd:
Von Karma...? It's been a long time.
Manfred:
I knew you would show up. You usually do when the Yatagarasu is involved, and I see this case is no exception.
Edgeworth:
Do you know Detective Badd, sir?
Manfred:
Yes. He's like an old bloodhound that never leaves the scene of a crime. If only he would get a promotion and move on.
Badd:
It's the crime scene where a detective is most useful and effective.
Manfred:
Hmph! It's not like I don't know that. Moving on though, Badd. The man that I just passed by... ...was he not the suspect from the KG-8 Incident!?
Edgeworth:
(So I was right...!)
Manfred:
Just what is that man doing, wandering around here!? That Faraday... I can't believe he let such an easy catch get away! Imbecile! I would've proved his guilt in three minutes!
Badd:
Von Karma! ...I think you've said enough for now. It's in poor taste to speak like that about the departed.
Manfred:
Hmph...Very well. Back on topic... I'm placing Edgeworth in charge of the investigation here...
Franziska:
Objection!
???:
Papa! How can you place him in charge!?
Edgeworth:
Franziska... What are you doing here?
Franziska:
I'm here for summer vacation, what else?
Edgeworth:
(Franziska von Karma... So she is here on vacation from Germany... She is the daughter of Manfred von Karma and a student of his, who's also junior to me.)
Franziska:
You're the one who's junior to me! And don't you forget it!
Edgeworth:
You're not conveniently avoiding the Bar Examination, are you?
Franziska:
Hah... If you were able to pass, then I'll have absolutely no trouble at all. I'll never allow myself to lose to you! Never!
Edgeworth:
(Why does she always have to be this competitive...?)
Franziska:
Anyway... Papa... Are you really assigning Miles Edgeworth to cover the case?
Manfred:
Yes, I am. Why do you ask?
Franziska:
Well, you know... I'm close to becoming a prosecutor myself... And I am 100% confident that I can do a better job than him!
Edgeworth:
(That's just like Franziska. She has no problem bad-mounting someone right in front of them.)
Manfred:
...Badd.
Badd:
Yeah...?
Manfred:
These two will be conducting the investigation.
Badd:
What? You want me to let both of these kids loose on the crime scene?
Manfred:
Hah. This is a perfect opportunity for them to work on their prosecutorial skills.
Badd:
A crime scene is not a place for children to be messing around in!
Manfred:
I'm the one with the authority over this crime scene, Badd. ...And I will not tolerate complaining.
Badd:
...Knngh...!
Manfred:
Edgeworth! Franziska! I leave this case to the two of you.
Edgeworth:
Understood, sir.
Franziska:
Yes, Papa.
Manfred:
I'll go take care of the paperwork now. Remember, I'll accept nothing but a perfect report from the both of you. Do not disappoint me.
Badd:
Hold up, Von Karma.........! I still... haven't agreed to this!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth...!
Edgeworth:
It's been quite some time, Franziska.
Franziska:
This will be the perfect chance for us... ...to see which of us is truly worthy of the Von Karma name.
Edgeworth:
Would it kill you to at least say hello?
Franziska:
Unngh... Umm... Long time no see.
Edgeworth:
Very good.
Franziska:
Just because you became a prosecutor first doesn't mean you can act all proud!
Edgeworth:
(S-She hasn't changed a bit...)
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! As I was saying, we shall see which one of us is worthy of the Von Karma name...
Badd:
For cryin' out loud... I've been reduced to a babysitter...
Edgeworth:
(It looks like Mr. von Karma was successful in convincing the detective. That's just like him; he never fails.) Now, I'd appreciate it if you could quickly run me through the facts, Detective Badd.
Badd:
You're better off checking things out on your own.
Edgeworth:
...Very well. (Seems like getting help from Detective Badd will be a most arduous task...)
September 10, 4:15 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Edgeworth:
(Nngh... Is the only real explanation that they killed each other simultaneously...?)
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! You should listen to someone until they are finished talking!
Edgeworth:
Umm... What are you talking about?
Franziska:
I'll only say it one more time... This is a competition to see who is truly worthy of the Von Karma name!
Edgeworth:
A competition...?
Franziska:
The person that figures out the truth first wins.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... So the person who doesn't discover the truth is a dishonor to the name?
Franziska:
Exactly! I don't care that you became a prosecutor before me... ...I simply refuse to hear any more foolish things come from your foolishly, foolish mouth.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Fine, whatever makes you happy.
Franziska:
Can I take that as you accepting my challenge?
Edgeworth:
Once again... Whatever makes you happy.
Franziska:
Hah... Well then, let's begin the investigation, shall we? I'm going to find the perfect evidence and prettily present it like the professional I am.
Edgeworth:
(Competing to discover the truth behind a crime -- how delightfully... childish.)
Badd:
You kids, over there! Hold it!
Edgeworth:
"Kid"!?
Franziska:
Ha! Serves you right, Miles. He just called you a kid...!
Badd:
...I said "kids", kid.
Franziska:
H-How dare you call me a kid as well!?
Badd:
I'll do what I please. And I won't allow you to cause a ruckus on my crime scene. Hey, big guy. You're... going to watch over these two.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! Detective Badd, sir! Now, do what I say from now on kids, OK!?
Franziska:
You'd better not get in our way, Scruffy! You'll feel the bite of my whip if you do!
Gumshoe:
E-Eeek! Th-Then you, p-prosecutor boy! Let's get your investigation started already, alright!?
Edgeworth:
(Great. Now, even THAT detective is treating me like a child...)
Gumshoe:
Alright! It's time to get investigating! Get a move on, prosecutor boy!
Edgeworth:
...My name is Miles Edgeworth. And if you were to call me "prosecutor boy" one more time... ...it will be my duty as a prosecutor to "look into" your monthly salary.
Gumshoe:
Wh-What!? And what would you do with my salary after you saw how much it was!?
Edgeworth:
That's up to you now, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
Really!? Sounds good, pal!
Edgeworth:
(He's so naïve...)
Begin Investigation
Defendant Lobby No. 2
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd, may I have a word with you?
Badd:
...What is it?
Edgeworth:
It appears that both a knife and a gun were used as murder weapons.
Badd:
...Yeah, it does.
Edgeworth:
That leads us to our first question of the investigation. Where did the men acquire the weapons?
Badd:
...The gun was inside of Faraday's bag. It was a piece of evidence that was presented in the trial earlier today. It was used... to kill the Cohdopian Embassy staff member. But... I never heard anything about the knife. Mr. Rell was being held by the police. There's no way he could have brought it in. Which means it's possible that Faraday had the knife on him from the start as well.
Edgeworth:
(Could it have been a piece of evidence that had yet to be presented...? But then, why doesn't Detective Badd know about it? Wait! What if...!?) It's possible that Mr. Faraday brought the knife in under the guise of prosecutorial evidence. He could have then brought it out and attacked Mr. Rell with it.
Badd:
Huh... Maybe you've got a brain in there after all, kid.
Edgeworth:
Nngh...! (Is he going to treat me like a child forever!?)
Badd:
...It looks like Mr. Faraday attacked Mr. Rell first, who then counterattacked... That's the only logical conclusion you can draw from a scene like this.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... Not yet. I feel that it's much too early to be drawing conclusions already. I must first find conclusive evidence, so as to ensure the honor of the Von Karma name.)
Logic
"Neat and tidy table" and "Plastic bags strewn about"
Edgeworth:
There is a very tidy pile of plastic bags on the table... ...and yet, a portion of them wound up scattered on the floor as well. It's not likely that the ones on the floor were knocked over during a struggle... ...in which case, might there not be another explanation as to how they got there?
Gumshoe:
Umm... Another reason...?
Edgeworth:
I believe it's possible that the blood on the outside of the bag is related somehow.
Gumshoe:
Eek! Please get that blood away from me, pal!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Whose blood is on this bag?
Gumshoe:
Ummm... Hold on, let me ask the lab guy!
Edgeworth:
Alright. Please hurry. ..................
Gumshoe:
Wait 'till you get a load of this, pal! It's Mr. Faraday's! Oh, and the technician said they didn't find anything else on or in the bag, either.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It would appear that this bag is a very important piece of evidence.
Gumshoe:
OK, if you say so! I leave it in your hands, pal!
Plastic Bag data jotted down in my Organizer.
"Ink stain" and "Fountain pen in pocket"
Edgeworth:
That splotch on Mr. Faraday's hand... I wonder if it might be the ink from his fountain pen.
Gumshoe:
Ooh, let's ask the lab guy!
Forensics:
Detective Gumshoe! I can confirm that the substance on Mr. Faraday' hand is the ink from his fountain pen!
Gumshoe:
I see. Good work! Ahhh... You know, I've always wanted to say that! Even if it was just one time in my life!
Edgeworth:
......... (If Mr. Faraday wrote with his fountain pen in his left hand... I think it's fair to assume he was left-handed.) It appears that Mr. Faraday's pen is very important to our case as well.
Gumshoe:
OK, if you say so, pal!
Mr. Faraday's Fountain Pen data jotted down in my Organizer.
Partner
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal?
The investigation
Gumshoe:
I-I'm so excited, pal! This is my first real crime scene! Let's get investigating!
Edgeworth:
Umm... Detective Gumshoe... I thought investigations were supposed to be conducted in a calm, collected manner.
Gumshoe:
Hmph! What do you know about how to run an investigation, little boy prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
I know that at the very least, I have greater grasp than you of what happened here.
Gumshoe:
Why you! You don't know any more than me, pal! Look, you just stay behind me, boy, and out of the way!
Edgeworth:
(Ironic coming from the guy that's been a step behind me the entire case...)
Notice anything?
Gumshoe:
This is my first time setting foot inside the courthouse! Who would've thought it'd be for my first case as a detective? But you know... I get the feeling I'll be coming here a lot more in the future!
Edgeworth:
...As a suspect, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Of course not, pal! Anyway, this lobby's actually pretty luxurious. I mean, for a defendant's lobby, it's got a pretty big TV... Oh! And there's that tea set on the table over there! Bet you didn't know that I like to drink tea... Wow, this room really is decked out. If it means spending time in here, maybe being a suspect isn't such a bad thing after all!
Edgeworth:
(I'm beginning to suspect that leaving this detective in charge of anything might be bad... But he is right; this room is rather well furnished. And somewhere in this room, the truth is slumbering. It's time to find it, and give it a wake-up call!)
The murder
Edgeworth:
So... Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, what is it, boy?
Edgeworth:
(Grr! Of all the people to call me that, this detective is by far the least qualified!) ...I wanted to ask you about how the investigation is proceeding.
Gumshoe:
......See for yourself... pal. Ho ho! Do I do a great Detective Badd or what!?
Edgeworth:
(Has this man not a professional bone in his body!?) Nngh... Very well, then I will inspect the victims' bodies myself.
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Gumshoe:
Hey, so that's a prosecutor's badge, huh?
Edgeworth:
You mentioned that you've only recently become a detective, did you not?
Gumshoe:
You got it! I'm a brand spankin' new detective!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... So that means you've probably never seen a real Prosecutor's Badge, right? If you so happened to want to take a look, I just might be able to make your day.
Gumshoe:
You don't have to go through the trouble, pal, because a real man has a police badge! And someday, I'm gonna become an Ace Detective, just like Detective Badd!
Edgeworth:
..................
Gumshoe:
Umm... Did I say something wrong, pal?
Edgeworth:
.........Let's return to the investigation, Detective!
Det. Gumshoe's Testimony
Gumshoe:
That's the whole truth there, pal. I swear!
Edgeworth:
So, you were guarding the door to Lobby No. 2 at the time of the crime, correct?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, that's right! And I'll have you know, not even a single ant got by me!
Edgeworth:
Really? Are you sure that not even a single ant slipped in?
Gumshoe:
Well, umm... Guess if we're talking about "slipped in", then maybe a frog or something did!
Edgeworth:
...It would appear that my point also completely slipped you by, Detective.
Handgun
Gumshoe:
Eeeek! Hey, pal! I'd appreciate it if you didn't point that thing at me, OK!?
Edgeworth:
Don't get cheeky with me, Detective! I simply wished to show it to you.
Gumshoe:
And? You got a point in showing it to me!? B-Because I don't even have a single penny on me, so you're out of luck, pal!
Edgeworth:
(Well THAT was an unusual reaction to being shown a piece of evidence...)
Knife
Gumshoe:
That knife is one of the murder weapons, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes, it is the weapon that took Mr. Faraday's life.
Gumshoe:
Ooonnnrrrgh... There's blood stuck on the blade, and it's still fresh...
Edgeworth:
You're in the Homicide Division, correct? You'll be seeing a lot more blood. Even if it's not your cup of tea, you might as well get used to it.
Gumshoe:
Rnnngh... But the sight of blood isn't something I want to get used to...
Edgeworth:
Don't think of it as seeing blood, but rather, as a representation of the killer. If viewed in that sense, you begin to see how the killer operates.
Gumshoe:
...You're right, pal! Thanks for the fresh perspective. I feel so much better now!
Edgeworth:
(Hmph... I'm glad someone does.)
Mr. Faraday's Fountain Pen
Gumshoe:
So that's what Mr. Faraday uses to write with. It's in a completely different league from my 10 for $9.95 ballpoint pens!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It looks to be well-used.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, he probably used it a lot at work. I heard he was really passionate about his job. I just can't believe he died like this... Poor guy.
Edgeworth:
(As for why he died... I suppose I'll find that out once we solve this case.)
Plant
Edgeworth:
This decorative plant's foliage is quite nice. It's actually soothing to be around it. Hmm... Perhaps I should purchase one for my room.
Sofa
Edgeworth:
(It looks like this sofa is ready to be disposed of...)
Gumshoe:
It's so soft! I could sleep for all 25 hours of the day on this thing!
Edgeworth:
.................. (If only I could dispose of him...)
Plastic bags
Edgeworth:
Hm...? Why are there plastic bags scattered all around?
Gumshoe:
Those bags are for keeping evidence safe, pal.
Edgeworth:
I know that much, Detective.
Gumshoe:
You sure are good at this stuff, aren't you, pal!?
Edgeworth:
(Normally, I'd be happy when someone compliments me, but when it's this guy... Anyway, could these plastic bags be evidence of a fight (Plastic bags strewn about - Plastic bags used to store evidence are strewn all over the floor.) between the two men?)
Bodies
Edgeworth:
(It looks like Mr. Faraday fell on top of Mr. Rell. At first glance, it seems like they must have killed each other, however...)
Gumshoe:
Using logic, the only conclusion is... Aha!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What was that outburst for!?
Gumshoe:
My detective's instinct just hit me real hard! It was Mr. Rell that feel first, see!
Edgeworth:
You don't need a detective's instinct for that! It's common sense!! (But I suppose we won't know much more than that until after I examine the bodies.)
Before obtaininh Crime Scene Notes
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After obtaining Crime Scene Notes
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Gun
Gumshoe:
Looks like Mr. Faraday died while holding the gun in his right hand...
Edgeworth:
So he shot Mr. Rell, and then fell on top of him while still gripping onto the gun...?
Gumshoe:
...I guess that does seem kinds strange, huh? I mean, why would Mr. Faraday know how to fire a gun!?
Edgeworth:
It's not exactly rocket science; even I know how to pull a trigger. ...Although I doubt I'll ever need to use one.
Gumshoe:
I hope I never have to fire a gun, either, pal. But it sure look cool to hold a gun in your hands!
Edgeworth:
(It appears that the police's screening procedures need a thorough review... Anyway, I should jot down some notes about the handgun in Mr. Faraday's hand.)
Handgun data jotted down in my Organizer.
Faraday's left hand
Gumshoe:
His hand is all black down here, see? ...I wonder what it could be?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... If you look closely... ...this blotching pattern resembles an ink stain (Ink stain - Mr. Faraday has ink on his left hand. Why is there ink on such a place anyway?).
Gumshoe:
An... ink stain?
Edgeworth:
Yes. I usually get ink on my own hand when I use my feather pen.
Gumshoe:
A feather pen...? I've never seen one before. Sure you aren't just making it up, pal?
Byrne Faraday
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday... How ironic it is for him to lose his life in a courthouse.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, why did it to be like this? I don't know what to say... I can't believe this happened while I was on watch, pal!
Edgeworth:
Rather than beathing yourself up, you should spend your time continuing the investigation. Didn't you become a detective in order to solve crimes?
Gumshoe:
...Yeah.
Edgeworth:
Then get back to work. Find out the cause of his murder!
Gumshoe:
R-Right! I'm on it, pal!
Mack Rell
Edgeworth:
First he killed a Cohdopian Embassy staff member, then he was murdered himself.
Gumshoe:
This guy... wasn't exactly an angel, you know.
Edgeworth:
Oh? What makes you say that?
Gumshoe:
Well, he's been hauled in to the precinct several times for theft and assault, pal. So yeah, he's definitely the type to have committed a murder or two.
Edgeworth:
Well, he did admit to killing Mr. Deid Mann.
Gumshoe:
Hey! Good point, pal! I knew my detective's intuition was telling me something!
Edgeworth:
Detective's intuition...?
Gumshoe:
Yup! Do you know about it? It's a special feeling that all detec--
Edgeworth:
We don't have time for this conversation right now. Let's return to the investigation.
Knife
Gumshoe:
Looks like Mr. Rell died with the knife in his hand.
Edgeworth:
There's some blood stuck on it.
Gumshoe:
Then, he must've used this as a weapon. Yup, no doubt about it!
Edgeworth:
(Was Mr. Faraday carrying this on his personage...? Did he bring this as a piece of evidence for the trial? Or... did he bring it with a very different intention in mind...? I should jot some notes down about it.)
Knife data jotted down in my Organizer.
(Examining gun, Faraday's left hand, and knife leads to:)
Edgeworth:
Mr. Rell's cause of death was from being shot, correct? That's what we think, but it's hard to tell with him lying face down. Death is bad enough, but it's truly lamentable that someone would try to hide the truth.
Gumshoe:
...Um, are you sure they were trying to hide something?
Edgeworth:
(I can't confirm Mr. Rell's cause of death with his body positioned like that.) Detective Badd, I'd like to examine the bodies in firther detail, if possible...
Franziska:
What's this? You're not able to form a theory with them the way they are?
Edgeworth:
I believe an examination of the bodies is vital to finding the perfect evidence, don't you?
Franziska:
Hmm... I suppose you do have a point. Well!? Hurry up and get on with it!
Badd:
...Labbie.
Forensics:
Yes, sir! We've taken enough photos of the scene, sir.
Badd:
...And there you have it.
Edgeworth:
..................
Badd:
..................
Edgeworth:
D-Do you not approve?
Badd:
...Of course not.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Badd:
Investigation of a crime scene is the work of a detective. So don't touch a thing. Hey, big fella, turn over the bodies for me, will you?
Gumshoe:
O-OK......... Please forgive me, Mr. Faraday, sir...!
Badd:
Gumshoe... do not get emotionally involved. Remember, you're a detective!
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! Understood, sir!
Knife
Edgeworth:
It looks like Mr. Faraday was stabbed with this knife that Mr. Rell is holding.
Gumshoe:
Y-Yeooooowch!
Edgeworth:
What's wrong, Detective!?
Gumshoe:
My stomach started to hurt from just thinking abour being stabbed!
Edgeworth:
...Just keep your mind on the case, alright!?
Rell's wound
Edgeworth:
Shot in the chest...
Gumshoe:
It takes some guts to fire a gun in a courthouse... I mean, I've been a detective for a whole week and I STILL haven't fired a single round yet!
Edgeworth:
There aren't any burn marks on his clothes. That must mean...
Gumshoe:
Wait... Burn marks...?
Edgeworth:
A round grows very hot as it is discharged from a firearm. Therefore, burn marks are usually left when a shot is fired from point blank range. Ergo, Mr. Rell must have been shot from at least a yard or two away.
Handgun data updated in my Organizer.
Gumshoe:
You sure do know a buncha neat stuff for your age, pal!
Edgeworth:
(...Apparently, this detective has as much comon knowledge as your everyday marsupial.)
Object in Faraday's pocket
Edgeworth:
There's something in his breast pocket. It's... a mirror shards (Fountain pen in pocket - The fountain pen in Mr. Faraday's pocket has an especially nice nib.).
Gumshoe:
Hey, you know, I always keep a pencil behind my ear! It's because Detective Badd is always telling me... "You should always write your name on everything you own!"
Edgeworth:
(Yes... Somehow, you do strike me as quite a forgetful individual.)
Faraday's wound
Gumshoe:
There's a knife wound in his chest here, see?
Edgeworth:
I wonder if the wound matches the knife Mr. Rell is holding?
Badd:
...Labbie.
Forensics:
Yes, sir! Verifying now, sir!
Badd:
...Make it quick.
Edgeworth:
(From the look of things... ...one could deduce that the knife Mr. Rell is holding is what killed Mr. Faraday.)
Gun
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday is holding a gun in his right hand.
Gumshoe:
That's the one Mr. Rell got blown away by, right?
Badd:
...Labbie, your answer.
Forensics:
Yes, sir! We've found that the ballistic markings do match that gun.
Gumshoe:
Oh, um... Ballistic markings are, um...
Edgeworth:
...Are the figurative fingerprints a gun leaves on a bullet when fired. Every gun leaves its own unique ballistic markings. Therefore, by looking at the markings on a bullet, you can tel which gun it came from.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, that's it! O-Of course, I already knew all about that, pal!
Badd:
.........Maybe you'd be better off going back to the academy.
Gumshoe:
Eeeek! Come on, sir! Cut me some slack, will ya!?
Edgeworth:
(So the bullet that was fired from this gun is what felled Mr. Rell...)
(Examining fountain pen and two wounds leads to:)
Edgeworth:
Let us now try to understand how the two men died. First, Mr. Faraday took the gun and the knife out from today's trial evidence... ...then he aimed the gun at Mr. Rell and fired. However, Mr. Rell managed to grab the knife and counter Mr. Faraday while being shot. Then, the two men fell together where they stood. ...That is my theory, in any case.
Gumshoe:
What a crazy way to go...
Edgeworth:
(Still... something about that explanation just doesn't seem right...)
Crime Scene Notes jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I believe I now have a firmer grasp on what happened here.
Franziska von Karma
Franziska:
Ahh... I see.
Edgeworth:
Did you figure something out?
Franziska:
This is a competition, Miles! And as such, I'd appreciate it if you didn't talk to me!
Edgeworth:
*sigh* As you wish.
Table
Edgeworth:
There are some plastic bags stacked up on the table. There's a tea set, too... but there doesn't seem to be any sign of a disturbance.
Gumshoe:
Yeah... The table's all neat and tidy (Neat and tidy table - The tea set and plastic bags on top of the table are completely undisturbed.). Maybe... they were super quiet in their scuffle!? After all, I didn't hear anything from out in the hallway, you know?
Edgeworth:
Maybe the plastic bags scattered on the floor are throwing us off?
Open window
Edgeworth:
The window is open, and... heh, there's a fresh, flowery scent in the air.
Gumshoe:
Ugh! The flowers in the garden down there are so gross and ghastly!
Edgeworth:
(......Do you think maybe you could try offering something useful for a change?)
Gumshoe:
Well, at least there's no way someone escaped through this window, pal! They wouldn't wake up and smell the flowers after a fall from the third floor.
Edgeworth:
...Are you willfully ignoring the fact that there are also iron bars on the windows (Lobby No. 2 window - No human can climb through these barred windows. The scene of flowers is in the air.)?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I guess there's that, too. Either way, no one could get through these windows, right?
Edgeworth:
(They thought of everything when they were designing this courthouse. Very nice.)
Bag on the table
Gumshoe:
There's some stuff in the bag, pal.
Edgeworth:
(I suppose this was Mr. Faraday's bag...) It's probably the trial evidence I was supposed to collect from him.
Gumshoe:
Th-This is the evidence!? Ah! I'd better not touch it! I'll leave prints on it!
Edgeworth:
(Do you just not pay attention to anything you do?)
TV
Gumshoe:
Whoooaaa!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What is it. Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
My TV at home is so tiny compared to this one, pal!
Edgeworth:
(...Then perhaps you should purchase a more normal-sized television like this one!)
Gumshoe:
Ooh, let me see here... Wow! This thing is huge! Uwaah! And way too noisy!
Franziska:
You're the noisy one, Scruffy!
Badd:
Don't touch it! You'll get your fingerprints all over it.
Gumshoe:
B-But...! I didn't touch it...
Badd:
Preservation of the crime scene is the foundation of detective work!
Edgeworth:
(The foundation, huh...? Sounds like something the rookie here needs to shore up on.)
TV (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
The TV has been left on...
Gumshoe:
Why are you looking at me like that!? It wasn't me! I didn't touch anything!
Badd:
Gumshoe... you do know what will happen to you if you touch something again... Right?
Gumshoe:
I won't touch anything! I won't even go anywhere near the TV, sir! A-And you! Get back to your investigation, alright?
Edgeworth:
I was planning to do so anyway.
Tyrell Badd
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd, do you have any thoughts on the case?
Badd:
Faraday and Rell... It looks like they killed each other to me... Although... there are a few things that just don't seem right.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... And what would they be?
Badd:
Hmph...... Why don't you try thinking on your own first before you bother me, boy?
Edgeworth:
(Wh--!? Now I've been downgraded to just "boy"!?)
Examine evidence
Blood on Plastic Bag
Edgeworth:
(This blood here is from Mr. Faraday, but there are no other clues to be found. Which begs the question... ...do I need to put this bag inside another bag to preserve it as evidence?)
Cap on Mr. Faraday's Fountain Pen
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It seems Mr. Faraday was in the habit of using very nice fountain pens.
Gumshoe:
That's the total opposite of me! I don't get these things at all...
Edgeworth:
Heh... Well, I think the pencil behind your ear suits you just fine!
Gumshoe:
Really!? You think so, pal!? Man, I knew it was worth something!
Edgeworth:
.........That wasn't exactly a compliment, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Wh-What? Me? I-I'd never do something like that!
Edgeworth:
(......Is it possible that she has never wanted to steal from a jewelry store before?)
Nib on Mr. Faraday's Fountain Pen
Edgeworth:
Hmm... This looks like a quality nib.
Gumshoe:
Hey, let me test it out, pal! Ooh... This is really, really... Ack! I got ink all over my hand!
Edgeworth:
...Detective Gumshoe. Don't EVER play with the evidence like that again!
(Connecting all possible Logic, examining open window and TV, and obtain Crime Scene Note leads to:)
Gumshoe:
I guess there's not much left to investigate, huh? They really did kill each other...
Edgeworth:
No... We can't conclude that quite yet. There's still something I find very peculiar here. The theory that they simply killed one another is too simplistic in this case. In fact, there is actually a contradiction that shows there is another possibility!
Gumshoe:
No way, pal! Really!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I suppose I will just have to show you the conflict in this crime scene.
Bodies
Deduce
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce gun and and present Mr. Faraday's Fountain Pen
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"Now we come face to face with the contradiction I spoke of, and it is... this!"
Deduce fountain pen and and present Handgun
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"Now we come face to face with the contradiction I spoke of, and it is... this!"
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
There is a clear contradiction with the evidence here in this spot!
Gumshoe:
Um... Really, pal? Because I don't see anything wrong there...
Edgeworth:
Hah... I was merely testing you.
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal! Don't make me arrest you for lying!
Edgeworth:
Ngh! (I guess I was mistaken...)
Edgeworth:
Now we come face to face with the contradiction I spoke of, and it is... this! Mr. Faraday used his left hand to write with his fountain pen. Ergo, he is left-handed. And yet, the handgun is in his right hand! Don't you find it odd that the left-handed Mr. Faraday would hold the gun in his right hand? That. lady and gentlemen... is the great contradiction haunting this crime scene!
Gumshoe:
Hey, you're right, pal! That does seem kinda strange! But... How could something like that happen?
Edgeworth:
The facts add up to one conclusion, and one alone. Someone else put the gun in Mr. Faraday's hand after he died.
Gumshoe:
Someone else...!?
Edgeworth:
Plastic bags scattered on the floor, and a gun in the wrong hand... I sense the presence of a shadowy figure behind this case. A person of vile intent who is serious about keeping the truth from us!
Investigation Complete
September 10District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Badd:
Here's the autopsy report.
Franziska:
"It is probable for that Mr. Rell survived for a short time after he was shot. However, Mr. Faraday died instantaneously from his stabbing." Interesting...
Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer.
Franziska:
It looks like we now know everything we need to know about this case.
Edgeworth:
Are you sure we know everything...?
Franziska:
Of course! The incident began with Mr. Faraday attempting to get his revenge. The prosecutor went into a rage from being accused, and tried to kill the defendant... But, the defendant fought back and they ended up killing each other. It's all very clear and simple. There is absolutely no margin for doubt.
Edgeworth:
Do you really believe that to be the truth?
Franziska:
Hah! Are you saying that just because I figured out the truth before you... ...that you don't want to believe it's true?
Edgeworth:
N-Nngh...
Franziska:
It's alright. If you disagree with my argument, then prove me wrong. Well, if there are any contradictions to be found, that is...
Edgeworth:
Don't worry, I will.
-- What Happened --
Franziska:
Mr. Faraday's death was instantaneous, while Mr. Rell survived for a short time.
From this, it is obvious that Mr. Faraday died after he shot Mr. Rell.
And Mr. Rell, while on the brink of death, stole Mr. Faraday's knife and stabbed him.
Those are the facts of this case.
Edgeworth:
(Mr. Faraday's death was instantaneous, therefore, he must've attacked first... Proving that logic to be false is probably the fastest way to show her that she's wrong. In that case, I should first look for any holes in her theory!)
Rebuttal
-- What Happened --
Franziska:
Mr. Faraday's death was instantaneous, while Mr. Rell survived for a short time.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Do you truly believe that Mr. Faraday died instantaneously?
Franziska:
I have the murder report right here... "Mr. Faraday died instantaneously of shock due to being stabbed in the chest." There, you see? It's been documented, clear as day.
Edgeworth:
Arngh...!
Franziska:
From this, it is obvious that Mr. Faraday died after he shot Mr. Rell.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday shot Mr. Rell before he died...? Do you have any basis for that statement?
Franziska:
Your foolishness has no end, does it? Now, I hate to repeat myself, however... ..."Mr. Faraday died instantaneously." That's all the basis I need.
Edgeworth:
Alright, so if Mr. Faraday died instantaneously... ...then he must have attacked Mr. Rell before being stabbed.
Franziska:
You're finally beginning to catch on, I see.
Franziska:
And Mr. Rell, while on the brink of death, stole Mr. Faraday's knife and stabbed him.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you believe that the dying Mr. Rell stole the knife from Mr. Faraday?
Franziska:
Mr. Rell became desperate as he did not want to die. Human beings can do amazing things when they are put to the test. So, the two men struggled... And in the end, Mr. Rell was able to grab the knife and stab Mr. Faraday. The messy condition of this room is a testament to their struggle. Hmm... Yes, my logic is perfectly sound.
Edgeworth:
...Can you really say that it's "perfect"?
Franziska:
What are you insinuating?
Edgeworth:
Nothing... However, I can't let what you said slide by without further inquiry. One must be clear and precise, so if you could append that statement to your testimony...
Franziska:
...Fine.
Change statement:
"And Mr. Rell, while on the brink of death, stole Mr. Faraday's knife and stabbed him." to "They struggled, and Mr. Rell used the last of his strength to counterattack Mr. Faraday."
Franziska:
They struggled, and Mr. Rell used the last of his strength to counterattack Mr. Faraday.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
About this statement...
Franziska:
Mr. Rell used all of his remaining strength to take the knife and defend himself. One can easily see that they had a violent struggle. Of course, it's nothing compared to what my riding crop can do.
Edgeworth:
(How does one compare the damage her crop can do with the state of this room!?)
Franziska:
Furthermore, all the plastic bags on the floor in this room... ...were scattered there due to the fight. Is there anything else that I can explain for you?
Edgeworth:
No, that will be fine...
Present Det. Gumshoe's Testimony
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"If the two men were fighting, their struggle would've surely caused quite a bit of noise."
Franziska:
Those are the facts of this case.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Claiming speculation as fact already? Don't you feel that the evidence is a bit lacking?
Franziska:
You'll find all the evidence you need just by looking around this room. Mr. Faraday collapsed on top of Mr. Rell... In addition, Mr. Faraday died instantaneously, making a counterattack impossible. Furthermore, the room is a total mess from their fight... Heh, I dare say that there's more evidence here than you could whip a whip at.
Edgeworth:
(It looks like she's becoming more and more confident... And... looking at this place, she might have a right to be. After all, everything here seems to support her theory...)
Franziska:
It looks like you're starting to see my point. I've as good as won our little competition.
Edgeworth:
(There's something strange about Franziska's theory... I should compare her claim with the data I've gathered thus far. I just know there's a contradiction somewhere!)
Edgeworth:
If the two men were fighting, their struggle would've surely caused quite a bit of noise. However, Detective Gumshoe testified that he heard absolutely nothing!
Franziska:
Hah. You place too much faith in that detective's testimony, you know. But for the sake of argument, let's say there wasn't a fight. How, then, did Mr. Rell get his hands on the knife?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday's bag was sitting right here in Lobby No. 2. It is not hard to imagine that perhaps Mr. Rell saw a chance and took it out at some point!
Franziska:
.................. So... What you're saying this: Mr. Rell took a chance when he saw the opportunity, and took the knife from the bag. And then Mr. Faraday shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed...?
Edgeworth:
Hmm......... (Isn't there something... strange in Franziska's statement just now?)
No, it all makes sense.
Edgeworth:
It... does all add up.
Franziska:
...So then, there's no problem, right?
Edgeworth:
N-No...?
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Yes?
Franziska:
Taking random shots in the dark is unbecoming of a disciple of Von Karma?
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh!
Franziska:
Now, take a step back and think for a change!
Edgeworth:
N-nngh... (Is Franziska's explanation of things really perfect? I'm going to carefully review what she said once again in my head!)
Franziska:
Mr. Rell took a chance when he saw the opportunity, and took the knife from the bag. And then Mr. Faraday shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed...?
Edgeworth:
(As I suspected... There is definitely something wrong with her theory!)
Franziska:
Hah... If you have nothing to say, then I suppose that I win--
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Wait, as I suspected, something doesn't add up.
Franziska:
...Oh?
Leads to:
"It's simply not possible for Mr. Faraday to have shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed!"
Yes, something is off.
Edgeworth:
Wait, something doesn't add up.
Franziska:
...Oh, really?
Leads to:
"It's simply not possible for Mr. Faraday to have shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed!"
Edgeworth:
It's simply not possible for Mr. Faraday to have shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed!
Present Crime Scene Notes
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"According to the coroner's report, Mt. Faraday died instantaneously, meaning..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is the piece of evidence that proves it!
Franziska:
Hah! And what is this supposed to prove?
Edgeworth:
...Take a closer look.
Franziska:
.........? I'm still not seeing it.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... In that case, I'll just have to try and explain it to you.
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth... You should know by now that you can't fool me.
Edgeworth:
Aaarghn! (I guess this evidence was unrelated after all... I have to think this over one more time... Mr .Rell grabbed the knife from Mr. Faraday's bag when he wasn't paying attention... And Mr. Faraday shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed by the knife. But it just doesn't add up, and I have the evidence that proves that it doesn't!)
Leads back to:
"It's simply not possible for Mr. Faraday to have shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed!"
Edgeworth:
According to the coroner's report, Mt. Faraday died instantaneously, meaning... ..that he died immediately upon being stabbed by the knife! Ergo, he could not possibly have fired the gun after that!
Franziska:
...Ooh, you got me.
Edgeworth:
But of course.
Franziska:
Well then, if the report is correct, then there is only one correct explanation. If we suppose that Mr. Rell attacked first... ...then Mr. Faraday, who died instantaneously, would have been unable to kill Mr. Rell.  Therefore, Mr. Rell must have stabbed Mr. Faraday after he was shot. Then they both died. That is the only explanation that make logical sense!
Edgeworth:
Negating your opponent's ideas in order to prove your own theory... I see you've been studying, Franziska.
Franziska:
I just wanted to explain it to you as simply as possible. before you foolishly propose a foolish theory that only a foolish fool like you could.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... How naïve of you to believe that only your opinions are valid... ...and still expect to discover the truth that the crime scene offers you... Franziska... You've still got a ways to go.
Franziska:
What are you talking about!? Are you saying there's a flaw in my logic!?
Edgeworth:
(Mr. Faraday dies instantly... And the fact that he did is what gives rise to the contradiction in this scene!) The contradiction here in this crime scene is...!
The order of events
Edgeworth:
There is a contradiction in the order you say the crime took place in.
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
...Oh? In that case, why don't you prove the contradiction already!? Miles Edgeworth! Remember that we Von Karmas must strive to be perfect in every way!
Edgeworth:
...Nnghhoooh!
Franziska:
And that kind of half-baked answer can hardly be called "perfect", now can it?
Edgeworth:
(Maybe I should've given a more detailed explanation... Let's see... Mr. Faraday died instantaneously...)
Leads back to:
"(And the fact that he did is what gives rise to the contradiction in this scene!)"
The order the bodies fell
Leads to:
"Let me get this straight. What you are arguing is this:"
The evidence bag's location
Edgeworth:
The evidence bag is too far away from the bodies. If the bag that held the weapons was this far from the victims... ...then neither of the two men could have taken one out without the other noticing!
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Heh. Weren't you the one who just said: "...perhaps Mr. Rell saw a chance and took it out at some point"? Now take some responsibility for your own claims!
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh...! (Maybe I should've given a more detailed explanation... I need to think this over one more time. Let's see... Mr. Faraday died instantaneously...)
Leads back to:
"(And the fact that he did is what gives rise to the contradiction in this scene!)"
Edgeworth:
Let me get this straight. What you are arguing is this: Mr. Faraday took the gun from his evidence bag and shot Mr. Rell. Then, the wounded Mr. Rell found an opportunity to take the knife and strike back. Upon being stabbed, Mr. Faraday died on the spot, and Mr. Rell died thereafter. If that's the case, then how do you explain this? Take a good look at the order in which their bodies are piled.
Franziska:
............N-No...!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday's body is lying on top of Mr. Rell's. Therefore... ...Mr. Rell must have died before Mr. Faraday!
Franziska:
I-Impossible!
Edgeworth:
(Yes, I agree that it seems strange no matter what angle you approach it from... ...which means that the real mystery behind this crime scene that we must solve is--!)
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
No...! Not so fast, Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
What now...?
Franziska:
I simply think that you ought to think a bit more outside the box... And that it's even clearer now that the incident started with Mr. Faraday's murderous intent!
Edgeworth:
(She sure bounced back quickly. An explanation won't be enought this time. It's going to take some very decisive evidence to prove her wrong!)
-- What Happened, Pt. 2 --
Franziska:
It was just chance that Mr. Faraday's body fell on top of Mr. Rell's.
The two bodies fell into a pile...
...which indicates that they attacked each other at the same time.
It really doesn't matter in the slightest that they fell in the opposite order.
Edgeworth:
(I just know that Franziska's explanation isn't absolutely correct. All I have to do is find a hole in her logic! Once I do, I can then present her with the evidence that proves the contradiction!)
Franziska:
I don't think you could ask for a more perfect witness testimony. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
(Not really. It's hardly perfect when there's a gaping hole in it.)

Edgeworth:
Th-That wasn't my intent! I simply wish for more details as to how Mr. Faraday ended up on top of Mr. Rell...
Franziska:
Hmph. Someone's impatient. I was just about to explain everything to you. So do you think you could hold on for a minute!?
Edgeworth:
Argh! ......Franziska, I'll make you a deal. I'll hold on if you hold on to that whip of yours.
Franziska:
Oh, I'll hold on to it alright, As I whip you!

Franziska:
...which indicates that they attacked each other at the same time.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
What do you mean by "they attacked each other at the same time"?
Franziska:
I assume Mr. Faraday had the two different weapons in his hands... He made to attack Mr. Rell while holding both the knife and revolver... and then... After Mr. Faraday fired the gun... ...Mr. Rell grabbed the knife as he was falling, and stabbed Mr. Faraday. That is how Mr. Rell wound up on bottom with Mr. Faraday on top. At close range, that is more than possible.
Edgeworth:
Yes, it's possible, but...
Franziska:
Well, if you have any other ideas... ...then show me what you've got!
Edgeworth:
Oh, I will. And to that extent... I'd like for you to append what you just said to your testimony.

Hmph... I don't see any point to that, but as you please.

Franziska:
That fact indicates that they attacked each other at the same time from close range.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You're saying that they attacked each other at the same time from close range?
Franziska:
Exactly. Mr. Faraday pointed the gun at Mr. Rell's chest and pulled the trigger. Mr. Rell then took the knife from Mr. Faraday and stabbed him before he fell unconscious. The dead Mr. Faraday instantly fell on top of Mr. Rell from the stabbing... ...pinning Mr. Rell under him, where he died shortly thereafter. And that's how they ended up on top of each other with no contradictions to be seen.
Edgeworth:
Hmm...

Miles Edgeworth... You're not listening to a word that I'm saying!

Arrngh!
Franziska:
They both attacked each other at the same time, and Mr. Rell fell first by chance... ...leaving Mr. Faraday to just happen to fall on top of him. Then, Mr. Rell died shortly thereafter, pinned underneath Mr. Faraday. That's how it happened.
Edgeworth:
(So the two men attacked each other, with Mr. Rell randomly falling down first...?)
Edgeworth:
(The fact that the order that they attacked each other in... ...varies from the order they fell in doesn't cause a problem for me. However, there's definitely one certain aspect that I'm having trouble swallowing!)
Edgeworth:
So you believe they killed each other at close range...? Sorry, but that's impossible. Just as it is written in the crime scene notes... ...the firing of the handgun did not leave a gunpowder burn on Mr. Rell's clothes. Therefore... Mr. Rell and the gun... ...must have been separated by a distance of at lease two or three yards!
Franziska:
Aaaaah!
Edgeworth:
(Yes... This is by far the biggest contradiction! The two bodies are piled up on each other, yet the gun was fired from a distance. And with there being no chance that Mr. Rell moved that far after being shot... ...that leaves only one possible explanation!)
Franziska:
Wh-What a completely foolish line of foolish thought from a thoroughly foolish fool! If I'm not right... ...then who was it that made the first move with the intent to kill, huh!? Who!?
Edgeworth:
The person that attacked first with murderous intent? That would be...
Mr. Faraday
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday, of course.
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal. What you're saying now contradicts with what you said earlier.
Edgeworth:
Well, um... (I have to re-think this... carefully!)
Leads back to:
"The person that attacked first with murderous intent? That would be..."
Mr. Rell
Edgeworth:
Mr. Rell, of course.
Franziska:
You know... ...your foolishly foolish foolhardy idea is making me feel just as foolish as you! The murder weapons used in this case were taken straight from Mr. Faraday's bag. The fact that Mr. Faraday had items that could be used to kill in his possession... ...is something Mr. Rell wouldn't have known!
Edgeworth:
Nngh! (She's right, of course... Mr. Rell wouldn't have known what was inside Mr. Faraday's bag... I have to re-think this... carefully!)
Leads back to:
"The person that attacked first with murderous intent? That would be..."
Neither man
Leads to:
"Here in this room..."
Edgeworth:
Here in this room... ...contradictions appear no matter which man we claim attacked first. Thus, there can be only one explanation. There was... a third person here!
Franziska:
...!
Edgeworth:
It was that third person who killed both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell... ...and set their bodies up to make it look like a double murder... That third person is the real culprit!
Franziska:
............ Miles Edgeworth... There's just one thing you're missing.
Edgeworth:
...Evidence, correct?
Franziska:
Exactly. Everything you've said up until now is nothing but a story played out in your head. However, this is where the real test begins. Can you prove that there was a third person involved in this crime!?
Edgeworth:
...Of course. (If a third person was truly here, that fact would resolve the glaring contradiction. The proof that this has all been a set-up, made to look like they killed each other... I'll present it, and lay bare the final piece of the puzzle that's not yet in place! What is the piece of evidence that proves there is a third person involved...?)
Present Handgun or Plastic Bag
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The gun in Mr. Faraday's hand and the plastic bag with his blood on it... These two items point to the presence of a third person."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is that very evidence.
Franziska:
...? And exactly how is this related? Do you think you could explain it to me?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... There is no need for an explanation.
Gumshoe:
Umm, well, I have no idea how it's related, so could you please explain it to me!?
Edgeworth:
Yes, well, um...
Franziska:
Let me guess, you can't explain it can you?
Edgeworth:
Hmm...
Franziska:
..............................
Edgeworth:
Gnnaaargh! (I-It would appear that I was wrong... But there is definitely a contradiction here... ...and it should resolve itself if there truly was a third person here... I just need to go over the evidence and my thoughts once again!)
Leads back to:
"(What is the piece of evidence that proves there is a third person involved...?)"
Edgeworth:
The gun in Mr. Faraday's hand and the plastic bag with his blood on it... These two items point to the presence of a third person.
Franziska:
How so...?
Edgeworth:
Recall Detective Gumshoe's testimony.
Gumshoe:
I was in the hallway the whole time, but I didn't hear a single peep of a struggle.
Edgeworth:
If there wasn't a struggle in this room... ...then there shouldn't be any plastic bags on the ground. Meaning that someone else must've deliberately scattered them around!
Franziska:
...!
Edgeworth:
Do you not see the possibility in this? Disregarding the gun for the moment... ...there's a high probability of blood splatter when a knife is used on a person. If the culprit held the knife with a plastic bag around it... ...they could use the bag to catch any blood splatter from when they withdrew the knife. Then, by spreading a few more plastic bags around, mixing the bloody one in with them... ...and arranging the room to make it look like there was a struggle between the two... ...they were able to conceal their presence!
Franziska:
Aaaaaaaaah!
Badd:
Looks like... we've still got a long way to go in this investigation...
Edgeworth:
Yes.

Yew:

Judge:
I-I saw it with my own eyes, I tell you! During the recess, there was a period of time when there was no one in the hallway!
Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Yew:
See, Mr. Badd? So I ask you, why would a detective who was supposedly doing his job the whole time... ...want to fabricate such a lie?
Badd:
...Gumshoe. Did you... Did you kill Faraday...!?
Gumshoe:
N-Noooooooooooooooooo! Of course not, sir!
Franziska:
It would appear that the one who set this whole crime scene up is that detective. ...Which basically renders his testimony a complete lie and wholly invalid. It looks like your "perfect" logic has just come tumbling down, Miles.
Edgeworth:
Nngh...
Gumshoe:

...Detective Gumshoe. You're now a suspect in the murder of two men. Now, spit out the truth, or so help me...!
Gumshoe:
I...I haven't lied to anyone, sir! Honest! I really was really there... I was in the hallway the whole time!
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd, I ask that you please do not act without my permission. After all, I am the one that is heading up this investigation, am I not?
Badd:
.........Don't talk like you know what's going on, boy...
Edgeworth:
All I want is for this investigation to run perfectly.
Franziska:
Perfection is the only wish of a disciple of Von Karma, after all.
Edgeworth:
Therefore, before you take Detective Gumshoe into custody... ...I'd like to set the record straight on something.
Badd:
...And what's that...?
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, what should I ask Detective Gumshoe about...?)
Motive for the murders
Leads to:
"I suppose the one thing I'd liked clarified..."
Why he wasn't in the hallway
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe, why were you missing from the hallway for a span of time?
Gumshoe:
Look, pal! Like I said, I was there the whole time, OK!?
Edgeworth:
But there is testimony against you that...
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! Why are you wasting our time with a completely useless question!?
Edgeworth:
Hm...?
Franziska:
The only logical reason as to why he was absent is that he was busy committing the crime!
Edgeworth:
!
Franziska:
Anyone who says otherwise... is a fool!
Edgeworth:
Gnnrk...! (Maybe I should ask about something else...)
Leads back to:
"(Hmm, what should I ask Detective Gumshoe about...?)"
State of the hallway
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. I take it that no one else was in that hallway at any time, correct?
Gumshoe:
Huh!? O-Oh, of course not, pal!
Edgeworth:
You're being awfully defensive... Might you be hiding something from me?
Gumshoe:
W-Watch your mouth, pal! You can't go around saying stuff like that about me without any evidence!
Edgeworth:
Hmm...! I suppose you're right. I have no evidence at this point...
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! How can you be losing a battle of wits with THIS detective!? You're a disgrace!
Edgeworth:
Gnnrk...! (Maybe I should ask about something else...)
Leads back to:
"(Hmm, what should I ask Detective Gumshoe about...?)"
Edgeworth:
I suppose the one thing I'd liked clarified... ...is Detective Gumshoe's motive for committing this crime.
Badd:
Hmph... Motive, huh. Gumshoe... You got a grudge against Faraday or anything...?
Gumshoe:
N-No, sir! Not me! Not a single bad thing against Mr. Faraday, sir!
Badd:
...Is that a fact...?
Yew:
Objection!
Yew:
...You really have a problem with lying, don't you, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
I'm telling you... I AM NOT LYING!
Franziska:
The more unnatural you act, the more suspicious you become, you know.
Yew:
If you want a motive, Edgeworth, I have one for you right here.
Edgeworth:
Could you please share it with us? However, be forewarned that I won't hesitate to object to flights of fancy... ...because all I'm interested in is the perfect explanation.
Yew:
Phwwh! Ahahahahahaha! You're serious, aren't you? ...Fine. You amuse me, so I'll humor you with a little courtroom practice.
-- Gumshoe's Motive --
Yew:
It was... about a week ago.
I saw the detective get chewed out by a livid Faraday in front of the precinct.
He stood there super pale, as Mr. Faraday yelled, "That's a salary cut for you, you nitwit!"
A brand new detective suddenly getting his salary cut -- that's reason enough for a grudge.
Well? How's that for a "perfect explanation"?
Gumshoe:
Y-You totally misunderstand me, pal! No matter how mad I get, I could never hold a grudge!
Badd:
.........Quiet. We can't trust anything you say...!
Gumshoe:
Sir...
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... There's nothing wrong with the motive she proposed, per se... ...but there are some gaps in her logic that need to be filled in. Ms. Yew's "perfect explanation"... ...may not be so "perfect" at all...!)

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
A week ago...? Then, you and Detective Gumshoe are acquaintances?
Yew:
Phwwwwwh...! No way. I only met him in-person today.
Edgeworth:
Then how did you know about Detective Gumshoe?
Yew:
Oh, I've seen him around before.
Yew:
I saw the detective get chewed out by a livid Faraday in front of the precinct.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday was upset?
Yew:
Yeah. You know what else? Mr. Faraday isn't exactly known to get angry often... ...Phwwh! Phwwwwwh! But there he was, totally beet red in the face! ...Ahem. And the offending detective just stood there, pale as a ghost, like he was about to die!
Franziska:
Just like the face he's making now, right?
Gumshoe:
Arnngh... I'm completely innocent I tell you...
Yew:
...Phwwh! Phwwwwh!
Edgeworth:
(The poor man.)
Yew:
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! ...Ahem. I was quite the scene with the detective.
Yew:
He stood there super pale, as Mr. Faraday yelled, "That's a salary cut for you, you nitwit!"
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You just stood there, watching this unfold in front of you?
Yew:
Yeah. I have to say it was really enjoyable, too. But that's why when I saw Detective Gumshoe earlier, I knew to steer clear of him.
Gumshoe:
No way... I thought it was because I had something stuck on my face!
Yew:
Phwwh...! Ahahahahahaha! But you do!
Gumshoe:
Huh? What've I got stuck on my face?
Yew:
Let's start with your eyes, nose, mouth... Oh, and those ridiculous eyebrows.
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Yew:
Phwwwwwh! AHAHAHAHAHAHA! Oh, man! Messing with your head is just too much fun!
Edgeworth:
...Ms. Yew. If you don't mind, I'd like to return to your testimony now.
Yew:
Phwwwh... Sure, why not?
Yew:
A brand new detective suddenly getting his salary cut -- that's reason enough for a grudge.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... To cut a new detective's salary right off the bat like that...
Yew:
I'm not really familiar with the way you guys relate, but is that a common practice?
Gumshoe:
Nnnnnnn... Speaking of cutting my salary, didn't you threaten to do that to me earlier, too!?
Edgeworth:
............I suppose I did.
Franziska:
It's only natural to cut a worthless detective's salary down to their actual worth. My father can even fire anyone, new or old, with a snap of his fingers.
Yew:
Phwwh! Do you think maybe that's reason enough for detectives to hate you people?
Badd:
.........Well, I guess... They really... shouldn't cut people's pay.
Edgeworth:
(Detective Badd... Don't tell me, Mr. von Karma cut your salary earlier...?)
Yew:
Well? How's that for a "perfect explanation"?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You call your explanation "perfect"?
Yew:
Ahah...! Is it not to your liking?
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately for you, it's just not up to my standards.
Yew:
Oh? Is there something you want me to clarify, in that case?
Edgeworth:
(What should I do? Should I raise an objection?)
Raise an objection
Leads to:
"Alright, if you could clear this one thing up for me...!"
Don't raise an objection
Edgeworth:
(Maybe I should wait and listen to what she has to say for a bit longer...)
Edgeworth:
(Detective Gumshoe certainly had a motive to kill Mr. Faraday. However, there is just one thing I can't wrap my head around in this explanation. I'll just have to force Ms. Yew to explain herself fully!)
Edgeworth:
Alright, if you could clear this one thing up for me...!
How Mr. Faraday was killed
Edgeworth:
You still haven't explicitly established how Mr. Faraday was killed!
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Going senile already, Miles? Mr. Faraday was stabbed to death with a knife!
Edgeworth:
Nnnghoooh! N-Not that! What I meant to ask was... ...how were the two men killed when they were in a guarded room!?
Badd:
...We're going to find that out very soon from Gumshoe at his interrogation, boy.
Edgeworth:
Aaarghn...!
Yew:
Phwwh... "Aaarghn...!" Oh, you're a riot, Edgeworth! Poor baby... Tell you what, I'll let you another go, how's that?
Leads back to:
"Alright, if you could clear this one thing up for me...!"
Motive for killing Mr. Rell
Leads to:
"I understand Detective Gumshoe's potential motive for killing Mr. Faraday..."
Faraday and Gumshoe's relation
Edgeworth:
Actually, allow me ask the detective directly. What was your relation to Mr. Faraday?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Faraday was in charge of training rookie detective to testify in trials. I met him on the very first day I entered the Criminal Affairs Department, pal.
Edgeworth:
Oh? I had no idea Mr. Faraday was so involved.
Badd:
Faraday... He may look like an easy-going guy... ...but he's actually... a bit of a nut for strict discipline and manners. Guys like Gumshoe... ...tended to rub him the wrong way...
Yew:
There, now you know how the detective and Mr. Faraday were related. Happy now?
Edgeworth:
N-No...! Wait...!
Yew:
Phwwh! ...You said you only had one thing to ask, right?
Edgeworth:
Nnnnnnngh! P-Please allow me to ask about one more thing.
Yew:
Phwwh... "Nnnnnnngh!" Oh, you're a riot, Edgeworth! Poor baby... Tell you what, I'll let you another go, how's that?
Leads back to:
"Alright, if you could clear this one thing up for me...!"
Edgeworth:
I understand Detective Gumshoe's potential motive for killing Mr. Faraday... ...however, what about his motive for killing Mr. Rell?
Yew:
His motive for killing Rell? Like I would know.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... If there was no clear motive for both of the murders... ...then I doubt this incident would've occurred. Wouldn't you agree?
Yew:
..................
Edgeworth:
Is there anyone else who might have had a grudge against either of the two men? Or should we look into that ourselves?
Yew:
Oh... In that case... .........I have absolutely no idea.
Edgeworth:
.........! (What? But that's impossible! She must knew SOMETHING!)
Yew:
Phwwh... Wait... Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Can you please not glare at me like that? ...It makes me laugh. Phwwwwwh!
Edgeworth:
(Grr...! I didn't even do anything, and you're already laughing away!)
Yew:
Well, anyway... the way I see it, as long as he had a motive to kill one of the two... ...this crime would've played out the way it did anyway.
Edgeworth:
...Oh? Would you care to explain your logic? And this time, please try to provide a truly perfect explanation.
Yew:
Phwwwwh...! Perfect this, perfect that... Stop being so uptight, or is that a requisite trait for being a Von Karma? Ahahahaha!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! I demand that you shut this rude woman up!
Edgeworth:
(...I wish you'd BOTH be quiet for just one second...)
Yew:
Ahem... Oh well. I guess I'll just have to explain it to you kids.
-- Motive To Kill The Men --
Yew:
There's no one out there with a motive to kill both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell.
All you really have to establish is that someone had a grudge against one of the two men.
Mr. Rell, who happened to be there, became a witness to Mr. Faraday's murder.
Therefore, he was killed out of necessity, and set up to look like they had killed each other.
Edgeworth:
(I wonder if that's really true... Is there no one out there with a grudge against both men? I should take another hard look at the evidence for this morning's case. The second KG-8 Incident, as people are calling it, involving an Embassy staff member... ...and the two men who both wound up as suspects in the case... Is there someone else I'm overlooking who is somehow related to them?)

So there is no one else who might have a grudge against both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell?
Yew:
I suppose "no one"... is a bit of a stretch. But I'm pretty sure no one like that was here in this courthouse today.
Edgeworth:
(...She's lying through her teeth. We just saw a someone "like that" here earlier!)
Yew:
Besides, you don't need to prove that the killer had a grudge against both men.

Someone with a grudge against one of the men... In that case, aren't there plenty of other people who fit the bill?

Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What!? Detective Gumshoe! Y-You would kill even me!?
Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaaaat!? I-I... I could never do something as terrible as that, Your Honor!

Franziska:
And you there, Ms. Yew! Hurry up and continue with your testimony. If you fail to do so... I will whip into shape!
Yew:

Therefore, he was killed out of necessity, and set up to look like they had killed each other.

No hard feelings, but I don't think we can take the word of a criminal seriously.
Gumshoe:
*whimper* B-But! I can't even begin to think up ways to set up a crime scene!
Edgeworth:
.........
Franziska:
...I suppose you do lack the necessary tactical mind required to do such a thing.
Gumshoe:
*whimper* Why do you have to kick a man when he's down, pal?
Yew:
Ahahaha! You shouldn't put yourself down, Detective! You're a big boy. I bet you thought it up all by yourself, right?
Gumshoe:
Y-Yeah! That's right! And I worked real hard as it, too!
Edgeworth:
(I think this proves one thing about the detective: he has the mental acuity of a worm.)
Edgeworth:
(I have to admit, her explanation makes sense. However, there is also something she overlooked in her testimony. I should present that piece of evidence, and see if I can't make her see the truth!)
Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew. I believe there is someone you overlooked in making your statement. Or rather... is it because you'd rather not bring this person up...?
Yew:
.........What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
We are looking for someone with a reason to kill both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell... I can think of at least one person that fits the bill! He was the suspect in the original KG-8 Incident... ...and a member of the Cohdopian Embassy staff, Mr. Manny Coachen!
Yew:
...!
Edgeworth:
That's right. The very man who came to visit you earlier out in the hallway.
Yew:
..................
Edgeworth:
The man who killed a member of the Cohdopian Embassy staff, Mr. Rell... ...and the man who was the lead prosecutor of the KG-8 Incident, Mr. Faraday... Are you telling me that Mr. Coachen has no reason at all to kill both of these men?
Yew:
Well......... I suppose he might have a reason or two...
Gumshoe:
You! You covered for me, pal! ...Maybe you're not such a bad guy after all.
Edgeworth:
Don't get ahead of yourself. You're still a suspect, make no mistake about that! The perfect evidence, the perfect testimony... These are the only things I wish to hold.
Gumshoe:
B-But I didn't do it...!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... You will stay under my authority, and go investigate Mr. Manny Coachen for me. And remember, I will not be very forgiving should any of this leak out--
Hold it!
Badd:
You want to investigate Coachen...? You'd just be wasting your time...
Edgeworth:
And why is that?
Badd:
...Coachen was up in the viewing gallery, watching the trial... or so I was told. Every cop in this place has been keeping an eye on the guy since he arrived...
Franziska:
Then the only real suspect we have is still Detective Gumshoe.
Edgeworth:
...I suppose so.
Gumshoe:
No way... Come on, Detective Badd! You've gotta believe me, sir! I really was in that hallway the whole time, sir! I never took a single step into this room, sir!
Badd:
...OK, then are you saying... there was someone else who passed through the hallway?
Gumshoe:
I-I... No... There was no one else, sir.
Badd:
.........Then why should I believe you didn't do it...!?
Franziska:
That is one incredibly foolish detective. Standing right in front of a crime scene all by himself... It's as good as a confession of guilt.
Edgeworth:
(I have to admit it's a bit strange. Most criminals will fabricate some sort of lie to escape their crimes. And if that detective really wanted to prove that he is innocent... ...you'd think he would at the very least offer up "I spaced out while on duty" or the like.)
Badd:
...Come on, Gumshoe. Time for your interrogation...
Gumshoe:
.........Detective Badd...
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth... I will go ahead and report this to Papa.
Judge:
And that, as they say is that! Right, everyone? Ho ho ho.
Yew:
Well, I suppose we should both be getting back to our real jobs now, huh?
Edgeworth:
Before we do, Ms. Yew, there is something I'd like to speak with you about.
Yew:
...What is it?
Sofa
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It's just another cheap sofa. If I should buy one for my office, I'll be sure to select a much more luxurious one.
Exit
Yew:
Ahahahahaha! Hey, wait! Phwwwh... Edgeworth? Phwwh... Where are you off to? Aren't you the one who wanted to talk...?
Edgeworth:
Oh, yes... Sorry about that.
Plastic bags
Edgeworth:
These plastic bags look like they fell here by chance at first glance... But all of them, with the exception of the bloody one, are just camouflage. I suppose you could call this a twist on the old "to hide a tree, hide it in the woods".
Calisto Yew
Yew:
So? What did you want to ask me about?
KG-8 Incident
Edgeworth:
The current case of the murdered Cohdopian Embassy staff member... ...I've heard that people have begun calling it the second KG-8 Incident.
Yew:
.........Only among you law enforcement types. And? What about it?
Edgeworth:
I'd like for you to tell me everything you know about the original KG-8 Incident.
Yew:
.........I'm afraid I can't help you. I don't know anything beyond what was reported in the papers.
Edgeworth:
No, I believe you know much more... since you are directly tied to the KG-8 Incident!
Yew:
......I'd appreciate it if you'd stop with the false accusations. Baseless outbursts are useless both inside and outside the courtroom, don't you know?
Edgeworth:
I do, but I also know that I DO have a leg to stand on here.
Yew:
............ Phwwh... Phwwwwahahaha. Think you can stop making that ultra-serious face in front of me?
Edgeworth:
Gnnnrk! I-If you could please stop laughing for just one second! (I'm not going to make any headway like this... I'm just going to have to show her... ...exactly how related to the KG-8 Incident she is!)
KG-8 Incident (after present KG-8 Incident Overview)
Yew:
As you guessed... the one who reported the smuggling activities of the Amano Group... ...was my sister, Cece Yew.
Edgeworth:
(As I thought...)
Yew:
And... she was killed right before she was to testify at the impending trial... ...by Manny Coachen! But, because he was tried once... ...and was acqutted, he gets to live out the rest of his cushy life, completely carefree.
Edgeworth:
All because of a lack of evidence.
Yew:
No, I heard that the evidence to convict him did exist.
Edgeworth:
What?
Yew:
I heard it from Mr. Faraday himself after Mr. Coachen's trial was over. Apparently. a man in black made off with the most important piece of evidence.
Edgeworth:
...! Then, the evidence had been tampered with!?
Yew:
...Isn't it just like a criminal to do something like that? The smuggling ring being run out of the Amano Group by one of its secretaries... They bailed Mr. Coachen out. Turns out, they were in league with each other all along.
Edgeworth:
How big was that smuggling ring? Was it a large operation?
Yew:
I don't really know. Which is why I wanted to become the lead defense... ...on this case that people are calling the second KG-8 Incident. But, I haven't learned anything new at all. I was probably expecting too much, I know...
Edgeworth:
You mean, you think this case has nothing to do with the smuggling ring?
Yew:
I... don't know what to think...
Manny Coachen (after present KG-8 Incident Overview)
Edgeworth:
Why did Mr. Coachen want to meet with you earlier?
Yew:
Actually... he came to watch the trial. Apparently, he only found out that I was the defense lawyer of this case after he'd arrived. He figured he should say, "Hi"... and one other thing: "Looks like you couldn't resolve anything this time either. Too bad."
Edgeworth:
......! What's that supposed to mean!?
Yew:
Phwwh... Ahahahahahahahahaha! Ooh, boy! Stop it with the scary face, already! I'm fine. Really. I gave him a good slap across the face!
Edgeworth:
(The way she talks about slapping him as she laughs away is kind of creepy...)
Yew:
Ahem... But, it's just as Mr. Badd said. He's not related to the double murder. I asked around, and people in the gallery claim that he was in his seat the entire time. ...Talk about "cruel fate".
Present

Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew... I believe that I have proof of your connection to the KG-8 Incident.
Yew:
That file is your proof? Very well, then... Why don't you tell me exactly how I'm related to the KG-8 Incident?
Through the suspect
Edgeworth:
You're linked to this case through the former-suspect, Manny Coachen!
Yew:
Yes, and that sheds light on our discussion... how?
Edgeworth:
Wh--!? (It looks like I jumped the gun on this one!)
Yew:
Phwwh... Ahahahahahahaha! Weren't you the one who mentioned it earlier...? About how Mr. Coachen came to see me? Obviously, that makes us acquaintances, right?
Edgeworth:
Nngh... I suppose so.
Yew:
So, is that all you wanted to talk about? If so, I'd like to get going.
Edgeworth:
W-Wait a second!
Yew:
...Hmph. Alright, then.
Leads back to:
"Why don't you tell me exactly how I'm related to the KG-8 Incident?"
Through the victim
Leads to:
"Your connection to the KG-8 Incident..."
Through the lead prosecutor
Edgeworth:
You're linked to this case... through Mr. Faraday!
Yew:
Well, I guess we WERE just duking it out in the courtroom... I suppose that makes us "related" in some sense. But so what? Who cares?
Edgeworth:
I-I suppose... (Nngh... I guess that wasn't it...)
Yew:
So, is that all you wanted to talk about? If so, I'd like to get going.
Edgeworth:
W-Wait a second!
Yew:
...Hmph. Alright, then.
Leads back to:
"Why don't you tell me exactly how I'm related to the KG-8 Incident?"
Edgeworth:
Your connection to the KG-8 Incident... ...is through the victim!
Yew:
.........!
Edgeworth:
The victim's name is Cece Yew. You will note that she has the same last name as you. Can you really still tell me with a straight face that you are not related to this case?
Yew:
.........Phwwwwh. Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! ...Sorry, but we're not related.
Edgeworth:
Wh--!?
Yew:
.........Just kidding. You asked that question with such a serious look on your face... ...that I couldn't help but... Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Edgeworth:
Mmmrrrrgh...! Ms. Yew, I ask that you please tell me the truth.
Yew:
..................Ahem. Alright. I'll tell you everything I know.
KG-8 Incident Overview (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew, I ask that you please tell me truth.
Yew:
Alright. I'll tell you everything I know.
Knife
Yew:
Mr. Faraday was killed with this knife, correct...? I feel bad for him -- being killed by evidence you prepared yourself is just awful.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew, what do you think about this piece of evidence?
Yew:
What do I think? Well, other than the blood, it's a very pretty and ornate knife. I'd love to use it as an ornament in my home. If it's alright with you, may I have it?
Edgeworth:
Wh-What are you talking about!? This is a weapon that was used to kill someone with!
Yew:
...Phwwh! Ahahahahahaha! Why so serious!? I think someone needs to loosen up!
Edgeworth:
Gnnrk! (There she goes again!)
Handgun
Yew:
Looks like Mr. Rell was killed by the very gun he used to kill the Embassy staff member.
Edgeworth:
You speak of the concept of karma, I assume...? And that you take your life into your own hands when you commit a crime, correct? Hmph... I never thought I'd be dealing with a gun this soon upon becoming a prosecutor.
Yew:
Ah, well, for a veteran like me, they're pretty much par for the course. To be honest, even if it's just once, I've always wanted to try firing one. Hey! Is that thing loaded? Do you think I could give it a try right now?
Edgeworth:
D-Don't be ridiculous! This isn't some kind of toy!
Yew:
Phwwh! ...Phwwwwh! I was only joking! Duh!
Edgeworth:
(Why is it that anything I have to say is a joke to her...?)
Bodies
Edgeworth:
To have set these two men up and make it look like they killed each other... If there's one thing I cannot forgive, it's the desecration of the dead!
Table
Edgeworth:
Everything is neat and tidy on top of the table, with not a single disturbance in sight.
Open window
Edgeworth:
A pleasent breeze is blowing through this window. If only I could exchange it with the stifling atmosphere of this crime scene...
Bag on the table
Edgeworth:
...It's Mr. Faraday's bag. The evidence for the trial of the Embassy staff's murder is in here. And if things had gone smoothly, they would now be mine. Including the two weapons in this double murder, the knife and gun, I suppose.
TV
Edgeworth:
The television has been left on... to preserve the crime scene, of course. And it will stay on until the police are finished with their investigation. ...Do they think nothing of saving electricity? *sigh* How bothersome.
Examine evidence
Cap on Mr. Faraday's Fountain Pen
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It seems Mr. Faraday was in the habit of using very nice fountain pens.
Nim on Mr. Faraday's Fountain Pen
Edgeworth:
Hmm... This looks like a quality nib. ...But I bet it's no match for my beloved feather pen.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Yew:
Well, this is about all I know. Haha... Sorry. Guess I wasn't much help, huh?
Edgeworth:
That's not true. I'm sorry I made you recall such a painful time in your life.
Yew:
Phwwh...... Ahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth, you really are too serious for your own good. You really need to learn to relax. We wouldn't want you to die of stress, would we?
Edgeworth:
...Thank you for the advice, but there's no need to worry. I work in my own way, and I will catch this criminal in my own way as well. You'll see.
Yew:
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Look at you with your game face on, ready to go!
Edgeworth:
I...! I'm making no such face!
Yew:
Did you know? Laughter is the best medicine, Edgeworth. Don't you get tired of making such a serious face all the time?
Edgeworth:
I'm charged with making sure that all the criminals of this world are found guilty. I... have no need for laughter.
Yew:
There you go, making that face again. Oh well. I've got to get going. I still have a few loose ends I need to tie up.
Edgeworth:
(.................. The KG-8 Incident and this murder investigation... It is my belief that these two cases are related to each other somehow. Plus, that detective... Detective Gumshoe...It's obvious he's lying, even though the lie is hurting his chances. ...Clearly, this case is far from over. But whether or not that detective is the murderer... ...can only be determined once I've completed my perfect investigation. Mr. von Karma... I swear to uphold your honorable name, or my name isn't Miles Edgeworth!)
To be continued.
September 10, 4:45 PMDistrict Court3rd Floor Lobby
Edgeworth:
Sir... What is to become of the trial into the Cohdopian Embassy staff member's murder?
Manfred:
Indeed. Since both the suspect and the prosecutor are now dead... ...the case will be dismissed. In other words, the trial ends here prematurely.
Franziska:
Hah... Looks like you'll have to wait just a bit longer for your big debut.
Edgeworth:
...I suppose it can't be helped.
Manfred:
The evidence for this trial will be transferred to you in a little while.
Edgeworth:
......... Sir, what do you think about the murder of the Cohdopian Embassy staff member... ...and the murders of Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell?
Manfred:
...What an outrageous circus it has all become. That Faraday brought it all upon himself wirh his naïveté.
Edgeworth:
An outrageous circus... Right, sir.
Manfred:
I grow weary of this topic. Edgeworth, I will have you assigned to a different case.
Edgeworth:
.........
Franziska:
Papa! You'll come and watch my courtroom debut next, won't you?
Manfred:
Hmm... I'll consider it.
Edgeworth:
...Sir, if I may, please allow me to continue with my investigation.
Manfred:
Whatever for?
Edgeworth:
I know that there is already a suspect in the murder of Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell... ...however, there is not enough evidence to prove that it was he who committed the crime. I'd like to continue investigating in order to find the perfect proof of his guilt.
Manfred:
The perfect proof? Don't make me laugh! A worthless person like you has no right to claim such a thing as perfection!
Edgeworth:
..................
Franziska:
.........Umm, Papa? Who do you think is the real culprit behind these murders?
Manfred:
..................
Franziska:
Miles and I, we're competing to see who can find the real killer first. Plus, being able to investigate a real crime scene is a really rare opportunity. It would give us some real-life experience, wouldn't you agree?
Manfred:
...Hmph! If you want to investigate this case that much, then do as you wish.
Edgeworth:
Then, you're allowing us to continue...?
Manfred:
In court, your top priority is to win, and a solid investigation is one of the keys to winning. We have to make sure you become recognized as a first-rate prosecutor, don't we? .........It wouldn't be very interesting otherwise. I'm returning home now. Edgeworth, Franziska! See to it I'm not disturbed, save for the results of your competition.
Edgeworth:
...Yes, sir!
Franziska:
Of course, Papa!
Edgeworth:
Franziska... Thank you.
Franziska:
What are you thanking me for? Your logic earlier was built on that scruffy detective's lie. That means that the competition is still on!
Edgeworth:
Yes, just as you wished.
Franziska:
Hmph... I couldn't let you get off so easily. Now then, let's see how well you fare on the investigation from here, Miles Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(I know I don't have enough information yet. So my first order of business will be to question anyone involved with this case...)
Partner
Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Today's trial
Franziska:
It feels like there's a whole backside to this case we're not seeing.
Edgeworth:
(And here we had thought that it was a case where the two men had killed each other.)
Franziska:
We're lacking in information. And as a Von Karma, I can hardly call this a perfect investigation.
Edgeworth:
Indeed, it is as you say.
Franziska:
Ack...! I can't believe we agree on something...!
Edgeworth:
(Just what is so revolting about agreeing...?)
Franziska:
Anyway! Our first move should be to speak with everyone related to this case!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Even if you had not said it, I was planning to do so anyway.
Franziska:
...!
Edgeworth:
Argnk! (What was that lash for!?)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Franziska:
Do you think you can win this competition by simply showing that to me?
Edgeworth:
Not at all. In fact, I was planning to thank you. I wouldn't be a prosecutor today without you and your father.
Franziska:
...I didn't really do much. You became a prosecutor first, that's all. But just you wait and see, Miles Edgeworth. Very soon, I'll be a prosecutor, too!
Edgeworth:
Good, then we can both send criminals away together as colleagues!
Franziska:
Hmph... But you can be sure that I will always get more convictions than you.
Edgeworth:
(It's almost cute that she's going this far to insist that she'll always win... Almost.)
KG-8 Incident Overview
Franziska:
The KG-8 Incident, huh... The defendant was acquitted in that case, but I don't think we've seen the last of it.
Edgeworth:
The fact that he was acquitted on a lack of evidence is just revolting. It's inexcusable!
Franziska:
Well, if it was my papa, he would've been found guilty in three minutes flat.
Edgeworth:
Heh... Indeed. We would do well to watch and study more from our mentor... ...so that we may secure a conviction for all those we try. That will be our rule.
Franziska:
...What's all this "we" business? Don't lump me in with you, Miles. Any suspect I come across... will confess everything to me before we even reach the trial! Hmph... I'll show you exactly who is the superior prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
(.........Clearly, only one of us is playing to win here.)
Knife or Handgun
Franziska:
It's one of the weapons in this case... I pity Mr. Faraday. It's bad enough to be killed with evidence that he prepared himself... ...but to also be killed in a courthouse of all places... ...and right in the middle of one of the trials he was running, too...
Edgeworth:
It just goes to show that nothing in life is predictable.
Anything else
Edgeworth:
I was wondering what you think of this piece of evidence.
Franziska:
Asking people for help is breaking the rules, Miles. As I said earlier, this is a competition! A battle of wits! If you want to ask someone for an opinion, you should start with yourself!
Edgeworth:
(...In other words, you have no real opinions about this piece of evidence, do you?)
Bulletin board
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Yes?
Franziska:
What is the meaning of this bulletin board!? Why are there so few trials posted!?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It would appear that the entire week is devoted to Mr. Rell's trial.
Franziska:
Is the crime rate really that low in this country? Or maybe... ...the police lack the proper motivation to get out there and catch the criminals?
Edgeworth:
...I'm afraid I can't comment on that, however... ...I can say I have my doubts about the younger detectives.
Franziska:
Sounds to me like they're in need of a stricter hand. And I'll start my discipline regiment with that pathetic, filthy-coated detective.
Edgeworth:
(*sigh* I feel bad for the big guy... and yet, I can find no suitable reason to stop her...)
Officer covering water
Officer:
I-I can't stop the water, sir!
Edgeworth:
It seems that the man who was here earlier broke it by drinking from it too much.
Franziska:
Bunch of fools who pretended to not see the foolishly foolish actions of a foolish fool!
Edgeworth:
Well then, why don't you lend the officer a hand?
Franziska:
Hmph. As if I should have anything to do with this. Besides, that water-drinking fool's mouth is the thing that officer should be covering. Let's give that officer a description of the water guzzler later.
Edgeworth:
(She seems to have quite the grudge... It sounds to me like someone wanted a drink...)
Door on center
Officer:
This area is restricted to authorized personnel only, sir.
Franziska:
If I'm not "authorized personnel", then what, may I ask, do you think I am?
Officer:
...Um, the younger sibling of a dysfunctional relationship...?
Franziska:
I'm not the younger one! He is! Now get that straight in your head!!
Edgeworth:
(I believe there is a more objectionable part you should be upset over, Franziska.)
Officer on center door
Officer:
Uuuu...nnngh...
Edgeworth:
What's the matter, officer?
Officer:
I've been standing here for forever, sir, and I really need to go to the bathroom...
Edgeworth:
Why don't you just make a quick trip? The nearest one isn't that far, is it?
Officer:
N-No, it's a short way down the hall beyond these doors, but... ...I don't want to be blamed for anything that might happen while I'm gone! So, I-I'm gonna hold it!!!
Edgeworth:
(...Perhaps Detective Gumshoe can be a positive influence on the force after all.)
Officer seeing courthouse model
Officer:
Wow! This thing is so incredibly detailed! My inner modeling fanboy is impressed!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... I'm not exactly a fan of plastic models, per se... ...but even I can sense the superb quality of this model.)
Franziska:
I simply cannot comprehend how that man can feel so much love for such a trifle.
Edgeworth:
Oh...? I-I see...
Franziska:
You're a disciple of my father. So you would go well to guard yourself against an interest in such unproductive things.
Edgeworth:
(Yes, perhaps I should take up whipping people like the young lady over here...)
Courthouse model
Franziska:
It's an incredibly detailed model, isn't it?
Edgeworth:
I heard that it cost as much to make that as it cost to build the courthouse itself.
Franziska:
What was the point of making such an expensive model!?
Edgeworth:
I felt the exact same way upon hearing it.
Franziska:
Ugh. It's so hard to understand such foolishness!
Edgeworth:
Agreed.
Officer on sofa
Officer:
Sir! Nothing to report, sir! ...ZZZzzz...
Edgeworth:
Is there no one who will make this man take responsibility for his actions on the job!?
Franziska:
Looks like we have no choice but to report this to Papa. Then, this guard can have fun in a waking nightmare after being awakened from his dream.
Edgeworth:
...Actually, let's not. I kind of feel sorry for him now.
Gumshoe and Officer
Gumshoe:
It wasn't me, I tell ya! I didn't do anything wrong!
Officer:
Yes, I understand. So let's just calm down, OK buddy?
Edgeworth:
(I doubt I'll get anything useful from the detective while he is this agitated...)
Bookshelf
Edgeworth:
It's a bookshelf... Hm? What's this...? "Judges' Trial Exchange Log"? It appears to be a journal where the various judges share their thoughts and ideas. (The real daily lives of the judges are laid out here on these pages...)
Franziska:
...There's nothing about the court in here! It's just page after page of unrelated drivel!
Edgeworth:
Judging by the content, they are very enthusiastic about the courthouse's daily menu. ...And it would appear that fried oysters are a favorite.
Franziska:
I have no use for such foolishly foolish words from that foolishly foolish crowd.
Edgeworth:
(Someone please assure me that this is not the true state of this country's judiciary.)
Examine evidence
Cap on Mr. Faraday's Fountain Pen
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It seems Mr. Faraday was in the habit of using very nice fountain pens.
Franziska:
Really? Because my papa uses fountain pens that are much, much nicer than this. The way he signs his name with those pens makes his signature look like pure art.
Edgeworth:
(...I'm surprised Mr. von Karma has to sign anything. I thought he'd have a crest stamp made!)
Nim on Mr. Faraday's Fountain Pen
Edgeworth:
Hmm... This looks like a quality nib.
Franziska:
Hmph. Well, my ballpoint pen is much easier to write with.
Edgeworth:
...You're obviously still too young to appreciate the finer points of a fountain pen.
Franziska:
! Don't treat me like a child!
Edgeworth:
(Nngh...! I wouldn't have to if you would only grow up!)
Blood on Plastic Bag
Edgeworth:
It would appear that this bag was actively used in the murder of Mr. Faraday.
Franziska:
! Wait... Isn't it possible that the killer left his fingerprints on the inside of this then!?
Edgeworth:
Sorry, but it looks like the killer was very careful not to leave any evidence behind.
Franziska:
...Sounds like we have a very clever killer on our hands. Which means that, on second thought, maybe that detective didn't do it after all.
Courtroom
Witness stand
Edgeworth:
It's the witness stand.
Franziska:
I'll make sure that each and every person that ever stands here will be found guilty!
Edgeworth:
There are others beside the defendant that stand at this podium, you know.
Franziska:
I don't care! Just make sure you never end up standing at one of these... ...or you'll be sorry!
Edgeworth:
.........I'll keep that in mind.
Viewing gallery
Franziska:
It's the viewing gallery. This is where the riffraff sit when they come to watch.
Edgeworth:
It's situated at the same height as the Judge's bench... I wonder if that's to represent the intense scrutiny of each and every case from all sides?
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! Are you or are you not man enough to stand up to all those eyes!?
Edgeworth:
What sort of--!? Of course I'm man enough!
Prosecution's bench
Franziska:
Any day now, I'll be taking my rightful place behind this bench.
Edgeworth:
By that time, I should already be standing here.
Franziska:
It'd be downright disgraceful if I beat you to it, wouldn't it?
Edgeworth:
If that were to happen Franziska... ...I'll eat my cravat.
Attorney's bench
Edgeworth:
It's the defense attorney's bench. .................. (I'd probably be standing on this side of the courtroom if that incident hadn't happened.)
Franziska:
What are you thinking about? Lately, the more wrinkly your face becomes, the less I'm able to read what you're thinking.
Edgeworth:
Well, I never--! I'll have you know, I don't have a single wrinkle upon my youthful brow!
Judge's bench
Franziska:
This must be the Judge's desk. You can tell by the gavel sitting on top.
Edgeworth:
I had a dream once that I was being squashed from above by this gavel.
Franziska:
You're such a weakling, Miles Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
You have no idea how frightening it was.
Judge's chair
Edgeworth:
The Judge's chair... It must be wonderful to be able to sit the whole time.
Franziska:
Yes, as apposed to us prosecutors and defense attorneys who have to stand. I think it'd only be fair if the Judge had to stand the whole time, too.
Edgeworth:
His Honor is an old man. He should be afforded some comforts...
Franziska:
Hmph! Fine, he can enjoy his chair, but he'll share in our pain through my lashes!
Edgeworth:
(I fear for the Judge if Franziska were to ever become a real prosecutor...)
3rd Floor Lobby
Calisto Yew
Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew.
Yew:
Oh, it's you, Edgeworth. And who... are you? Wait... you were at the crime scene just now, weren't you?
Franziska:
...You should be disbarred for not knowing who I am. I am Franziska von Karma, and I am about to become the successor to the family name.
Yew:
About to? I guess that means that for now, you're still just another kid. In which case, it's only natural that I didn't know who you are.
Franziska:
Wh--!?
Edgeworth:
Wh-Why are you whipping ME!?
Yew:
Phwwwwwwwwh... Anyway, it looks like they're planning to hold the evidence a bit longer. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's waiting.
Edgeworth:
I'm terribly sorry, but I have but a few more questions to ask of you.
Yew:
Phwwh... Ahahahahaha! Look at you -- eyebrows scrunched, with lines on your forehead... And that, "To ask of you"! Ahahahahaha!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What exactly is so funny!?
Yew:
Mnnpphwwwh... Sorry! I'm just bad at dealing with a super-serious atmosphere.
Edgeworth:
(Apparently, they failed to teach you proper behavior at a crime scene in law school.)
Yew:
Ah... Hoo. I feel much better now. So, what is it you want to talk about?
Edgeworth:
I'd like to inquire as to where you were at the time of the crime.
Yew:
We were in Defendant Lobby No. 1 the whole time, up until we heard the gunshot. And by "we", I mean Mr. Badd. If you don't believe me, feel free to ask him yourself.
Edgeworth:
You were with Detective Badd? Why?
Yew:
We had a little something to discuss, that's all.
Detective Badd
Edgeworth:
So, I take it that you are acquaintances with Detective Badd?
Yew:
Yes, he was the detective in charge of the KG-8 Incident.
Edgeworth:
! Detective Badd is also related to that incident!?
Yew:
That's right. He was the one who was supposed to protect my sister, Cece. But you know how that turned out, don't you Edgeworth?
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! I have no idea what you two are talking about! I've heard of the KG-8 Incident from my papa... ...but how does that case relate to you, Ms. Yew?
Yew:
The victim of that case, Cece Yew, was my little sister.
Franziska:
.........!
Edgeworth:
..................
Yew:
Ahahahaha! You're making that super-serious face again! I'm fine... Really. I just make it a point to rub some more salt in his wounded prode every time I see him!
Edgeworth:
(The way she talks about doing that as she laughs away is kind of creepy...)
Yew:
Oh, speaking of Mr. Badd, he and Mr. Faraday... ...I'd say they met up just about every single time the Yatagarasu made a move. It was practically a given that the two would meet up at every one of the crime scenes.
Edgeworth:
I see. He did mention that he is in charge of the Yatagarasu investigation earlier. (Maybe I should ask her what she knows about the Yatagarasu in more detail...)
Time of the murder
Edgeworth:
You claim that at the time of the murder, you were with Detective Badd...
Franziska:
...But don't you lawyers usually discuss the trial with your clients during a recess?
Yew:
We do, and that's what I was planning to do. But Mr. Faraday was being rather threatening and he dragged Mr. Rell away. After that, Mr. Badd came into Lobby No. 1, so we just stayed there and talked.
Edgeworth:
And what did you talk with Detective Badd about?
Yew:
Phwwwh... Nothing interesting. I just insulted him some... ...talked about how the trial was going... and then I insulted him some more.
Edgeworth:
(Bloody... When she's not laughing, her mouth seemingly spews nothing but insults.)
Yew:
Anyway, Mr. Badd and I were in Defendant Lobby No. 1 when the murders occurred... ...so I really can't tell you anything about the hallway or Lobby No. 2.
Edgeworth:
I see.
Mack Rell
Edgeworth:
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your client, Mr. Mack Rell. Now, your client first claimed to be the Yatagarasu, is that correct?
Yew:
Yeah... Once I heard that it was the Yatagarasu that had made off with the evidence from KG-8... ...I began to ask Mr. Rell all sorts of questions, but to no avail. Turns out, Mr. Rell was not the Yatagarasu. He had just made that up.
Edgeworth:
He made it up...?
Yew:
Mr. Rell's crime was caught on tape by the security cameras... ...but there is no footage of him sneaking into the Cohdopian Embassy itself.
Franziska:
Hold on for just one second! Then, you mean to say that you knew that he was not the real Yatagarasu... ...and that he was just another cold-blooded killer? And you were ready to defend him!?
Yew:
Yes, that's right.
Edgeworth:
I see... So a defense lawyer is actually just someone whose job is to cover for criminals.
Franziska:
That's why defense lawyers are so detestable! But they are no match for us Von Karmas!
Yew:
.........Phwwh... Ahahahaha! I don't believe it! You're serious! Why don't you save that face for something really worth being serious about? And Edgeworth, do you remember what I said earlier? I... phwwh... have my own agenda. Phwwwh... I'm still on the hunt for leads regarding the KG-8 Incident, alright?
Edgeworth:
And for that, you have not a single qualm about defending a known killer...?
Yew:
.........Don't put words in my mouth. I said no such thing.
Edgeworth:
.........
Yew:
The only was I had to get close to Mr. Rell was to be his lawyer. I had no intention of covering for him, ever. So don't you dare suggest I was going to.
Edgeworth:
...I'm sorry. Forgive my rashness.
Yatagarasu (appears after Detective Badd)
Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew. I was wondering if you could tell me about the Yatagarasu.
Yew:
The Yatagarasu, huh... I don't really know much about that character myself. But I do get a lot of consultation requests from companies to defend them.
Edgeworth:
Requests from companies...?
Yew:
The Yatagarasu isn't some petty thief out for money, you know.
Franziska:
Hmph. Alright then. Perhaps the Yatagarasu is in the business of stealing people's lives?
Yew:
............ You're not very funny, or witty, are you, little Miss. von Karma?
Franziska:
Grr.........!
Edgeworth:
Franziska! Be careful about who you whip! Choose carefully, or we may be sued by... Nnghhoooh!
Franziska:
There. I chose carefully, just like you wanted.
Yew:
Phwwh... Mnnphwwwwwwh! Ahahahahaha!
Franziska:
.........?
Yew:
Ahah... Ahahahahahahahahaha! Th-That just now... was hilarious, little missy!
Franziska:
Hmph. Of course it was.
Edgeworth:
(.........What is wrong with these two women!? Why does my pain give them delight?)
Franziska:
And? So, in the end, what is the Yatagarasu? I have to say, I had never even heard of this thief when I was in Germany.
Yew:
The Yatagarasu deals in information. Namely, in digging out dirt about back-room dealings and the like of companies. The Yatagarasu is a vigilante who steals such info and then makes it public for all to see.
Franziska:
Hmph. Vigilante or not, this person sounds like just another criminal to me.
Yew:
I suppose you could put it that way, too. But either way, I get a lot more clients now, thanks to that thief.
Edgeworth:
(...Sounds like Ms. Yew is profiting nicely.)
Present
KG-8 Incident Overview (after talking about "KG-8 Incident")
Yew:
My sister was killed in that incident... And the defendant, Manny Coachen, got off scot-free due to a lack of evidence! It's so frustrating... The prosecution was a breath away from putting him away.
Edgeworth:
(She's not laughing at this particular topic... Although, it's to be expected.)
Yew:
...Phwwwh! I can't believe what a forceful face you're making! Ahahahaha! That face is totally killing me!
Edgeworth:
(Nngh... Well that moment of seriousness was short-lived...)
Det. Gumshoe's Testimony
Yew:
Circumstantial evidence and a motive... It all points to that detective, doesn't it? On top of that, even his testimony turned out to be a lie. Well, that's what you get when you trust a criminal. They're all just liars in the end.
Edgeworth:
(All criminals are liars...? Well, at least we agree on something.) But that detective is telling a lie that is nothing but a disservice to himself...
Yew:
...Phwwwh. You're really too naïve, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. You don't understand. If I should leave even the smallest mystery unsolved... ...I can't really claim to have conducted the perfect investigation.
Yew:
Phwwh... "The perfect investigation"...!
Edgeworth:
(Speaking of... I fear that why she laughs when she does is a mystery I may never solve.)
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... I suppose I've gotten all I can out of Ms. Yew. I should move on and speak with Detective Gumshoe now.)
Partner
Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Present
Annual Bonus Envelope
Franziska:
Scruffy's annual bonus envelope? What a useless piece of evidence.
Edgeworth:
Yes, well, obvious point aside, what do you think about the low amount of money?
Franziska:
A pathetic amount for a pathetic detective. I think it rather suits him.
Edgeworth:
But don't you think it's a bit too low, even for an officer like him?
Franziska:
By his pay, I can tell he's a fool that I'd never trust anything to. A foolish fool like him would only blotch my record with foolishly foolish mistake. Well, not that it matters. I'll never have to work with that pathetic fool anyway.
Edgeworth:
(That was a bit harsh... even for you, Franziska...)
Dick Gumshoe
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Hey... It's you, pal! You're here. ...Yeeeeeooowwch!
Franziska:
...As am I.
Edgeworth:
(I don't think you needed to whip him to let him know that...)
Gumshoe:
I-I didn't do it, pal! I swear on my honor as a detective! I really didn't!
Edgeworth:
Your words are useless. I place my trust only in the evidence, Detective. Once the investigation is fully over, and should we find out that you are the killer... ...there will be no mercy to be had for you.
Gumshoe:
H-Have a heart, pal!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. But you're not worried, right? After all, you have nothing to worry about, if you really are innocent, that is.
Gumshoe:
That's right! Hey, pal! Go and do your perfect investigation and get the real killer for me, will you?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I would've done so, even had you not requested me to, Detective.
Motive for murder
Edgeworth:
So you and Mr. Faraday had a small "meeting" last week, did you? And what exactly did you do to make him so angry?
Gumshoe:
I just asked Detective Badd the same thing myself, pal. Turns out, he was mad at me because on my very first day as a detective... ...I reported in at my usual post instead of the Criminal Affairs Department. By the time I got down to Criminal Affairs, I was really, really late. And that's when he gave me that huge speech...
Franziska:
I remember doing the same exact thing in elementary school. On the first day of school every year, I'd always wind up going to my old classroom.
Edgeworth:
(How pathetic for the Detective to be compared to a mere schoolchild.)
During the recess
Edgeworth:
You claim to be standing guard in front of the door to Lobby No. 2 during the recess. However, when did you receive the order to do so, and from whom?
Gumshoe:
Umm... earlier, at around 3:20. and from Detective Badd, pal. Today's trial took a really crazy turn... ...so I was told to make sure nothing happened to Mr. Faraday.
Franziska:
And yet, something did happen to him, correct? It looks like it was a total waste of manpower to assign you to guard duty.
Gumshoe:
Owww! Your words sting worse than your whip, pal...
Edgeworth:
(So it was Detective Badd who ordered him to stand guard, huh...)
Next step (appears after During the recess)
Edgeworth:
Now then, Detective Gumshoe... Is there anything else you'd like to tell me?
Gumshoe:
............N-Nope, not a thing, pal.
Franziska:
In that case, allow us to take a look at what you are carrying on your personage.
Gumshoe:
Ah! Wait! You can't do that!
Franziska:
...There's nothing of any particular value here.
Gumshoe:
Well, my handcuffs and badge were confiscated by Detective Badd, you know...
Edgeworth:
And what is that open envelope I see sticking out of your coat pocket?
Gumshoe:
Ah! Hands off, pal!
Franziska:
Just show it to us already!
Gumshoe:
Yeoooow!
Edgeworth:
"Annual Bonus Check Within: $5.00 total"... Except there is no check inside.
Gumshoe:
You've had your look, now give it back, pal! It's my first bonus as a brand-new detective! I just got it and cashed it today! I had literally no cash on me up until I did, you know. So that envelope is really special to me! Now give it back!
Franziska:
You don't need rubbish like this. Don't worry, we'll throw it away for you later.
Gumshoe:
How could you...!?

A bonus of $5.00? Even for a new, rookie detective, that's a bit low.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, even though I just got promoted, I guess I caught the attention of the higher-ups!
Franziska:
At that amount, I'd have preferred to not receive one at all.
Gumshoe:
You just don't get it, pal! You don't get how great it feels to get your first bonus!
Edgeworth:
I suppose not. I have yet to receive my own bonus as a prosecutor.
Franziska:
Hmph. Well, I received mine from my papa last December, like I do every year.
Edgeworth:
...That's not a bonus. That's a Holiday gift.
Franziska:
.........Whatever you want to call it, Miles.
Anything else
Edgeworth:
I'd like to ask you a little about this...
Gumshoe:
I'm not saying a peep, pal! 'Cause I'm not the killer, OK!?
Edgeworth:
You misunderstand. I wasn't going to ask you about that...
Gumshoe:
All I've ever wanted to do was to become a detective, pal! So I'd never want to be a killer!
Edgeworth:
(It seems that he doesn't want to talk about anything unrelated to his predicament...)
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Officer:
I'm sorry, but I need to take him for questioning now...
Edgeworth:
(I think I've asked him just about everything I needed to... No, wait... Since he became a suspect, there is one piece of evidence I should re-confirm.) Officer, I ask that you wait a second. I still have one thing I'd like to re-confirm with Detective Gumshoe.
Officer:
Understood! But please make it brief, sir.
Edgeworth:
(I want to hear it from the horse's mouth... I must confirm whether or not his testimony about when the crime occurred is the truth.)

Det. Gumshoe's Testimony
Leads to:
"You told me earlier that you heard no sound, other than the gunshot, out in the hallway."
Edgeworth:
You told me earlier that you heard no sound, other than the gunshot, out in the hallway. Is that correct?
Gumshoe:
No mistake about it, pal!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... then, you are also claiming that no one passed through the hallway either? Is that also correct?
Gumshoe:
......Yup! Not even a single ant passed through that hall while I was on duty!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Hmmmmm... You do realize that the lie you're telling is only making life more difficult for yourself.
Gumshoe:
Huh? ............Oh. B-But it's true! I didn't see anyone go through the hallway, and I didn't hear anything else, pal! I bet the killer found a way to kill the two guys that's beyond what I can even imagine!
Edgeworth:
......... (So he intends to continue telling this ridiculous lie... But why would he do so, given the situation he's in? I believe a thorough investigation... ...of the hallway in front of the defendant lobbies is in order.)
Gumshoe:
Ack! You...!
Edgeworth:
Nnnghoooooooh!!
???:
*rasp* Phwwwwwwtt!
Franziska:
...How could you have not noticed that coming?
Edgeworth:
Nnn...nghhhh...! (Wasn't that... the child I changed money for earlier...?)
???::
Thanks! That's exactly what I needed!
Edgeworth:
Kids... can sometimes be so cruel...
Franziska:
It looks like she dropped something.
Swiss Roll data jotted down in my Organizer.
Franziska:
Maybe we should arrest the girl? She might turn out to be a valuable lead.
Examine evidence
Front side of Swiss Roll
Edgeworth:
"Courthouse Special Swiss Rolls"... Is this being sold somewhere on the premises?
Franziska:
I don't recall seeing a restaurant of any sort in this courthouse...
Edgeworth:
I somehow doubt you'd find junk food like this on a restaurant menu, Franziska...
Franziska:
Well then, where do they sell these things, huh!?
Edgeworth:
Umm... a convenience store, I suppose...
Franziska:
Well, I'm sure there's no convenience store in this courthouse, Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Gnnnrk! (...Where in the world did this come from?)
Edgeworth:
Mnrgh... I believe some sort of punishment may need to be dealt the next time we meet...
Edgeworth:
I believe I've asked all that I need to of this man. Now, for Detective Badd and the Judge...
Franziska:
We have to confirm who is correct, the Judge or that scruff-face, right? I suppose we should inspect the hallway in front of Lobby No. 2 next, then.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I suppose so. Shall we head on over, Franziska?
Partner
Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Notice anything?
Franziska:
That scruff-face's movements during the recess are really suspicious.
Edgeworth:
Oh? I suppose you noticed it too, then.
Franziska:
Of course I did. Scruffy is giving us a testimony that is nothing but harmful to himself. Normally, criminals would tell the opposite type of lie in an attempt to escape.
Edgeworth:
Yes... That is exactly the same point I'm having trouble understanding. (It seems that I need to expose what he was really up to during the recess. And to do that, I should head to the hallway where he was supposedly standing guard.)
Dick Gumshoe
Edgeworth:
May I have a word with you, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Argh... What in the world am I supposed to do, pal...?
Franziska:
I don't think he'll be of much use right now. Let's continue with the investigation.
Edgeworth:
I suppose so. I propose we go and inspect the hallway he was standing guard in next.
September 10District CourtHallway
Badd:
So... did you see anything else...?
Judge:
Hmm... No, I don't think so.
Badd:
I see... Well, thanks for your cooperation...
Judge:
Oh, it's nothing. Just doing my duty as a defender of the law.
Badd:
...That'll be all for now. I'll ask again if I have any other questions.
Judge:
Anytime, Detective. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a few loose ends I have to tie up... Oh! You're that new prosecutor Mr. von Karma recommended, right?
Edgeworth:
My name is Miles Edgeworth, Your Honor.
Franziska:
And I'm Manfred von Karma's daughter, Franziska von Karma. I'm set to become the successor to my genius father any day now, Your Honor!
Judge:
I see, Mr. New Prosecutor Recommended by Von Karma Miles Edgeworth, and Ms. Gen-- ...Ack...! ...I-I bhit mai tonnge.
Edgeworth:
...Are you alright, Your Honor?
Franziska:
Please feel free to refer to me as just "Ms. von Karma", Your Honor. As for him... Just "Edgeworth" is fine.
Edgeworth:
(Apparently, SOMEBODY doesn't feel that I'm worthy of a proper title.)
Judge:
Oho! Very well, then. I shall call you Ms. von Karma and Mr. Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...Your Honor, "Mr. Edgeworth" is fine, sir. Now, about your earlier testimony...
Judge:
Yes? What about it, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I would like to ask you a few questions about what exactly you saw.
Judge:
Alright. After all, it's my duty to clarify my testimony as a defender of the law.
Edgeworth:
I greatly appreciate your cooperation, Your Honor. (Now, the first thing I will need to do is figure out that detective's exact movements.)
Begin Investigation
Hallway
Logic
"Pink piece of trash" and "Windowsill cactus"
Edgeworth:
This pink, rubbery substance... I saw this in a different form earlier today. I believe this is a piece of a popped balloon.
Franziska:
I suppose that's possible.
Edgeworth:
The balloon probably got a little too close to our friend, the windowsill cactus.
Franziska:
...That would be the logical conclusion, yes.
Balloon Piece data jotted down in my Organizer.
"Vending machine" and "Swiss roll crumbs"
Edgeworth:
These bits of chocolate and cake... Could they not have come from a Swiss roll?
Franziska:
A Swiss roll? Why would a courthouse sell a thing like that?
Edgeworth:
It may not seem like the right venue... however, it IS being sold right over there.
Franziska:
The vending machine...? Ah, I see. "Stay neutral as the Swiss do until the end with these!" Two for $6!? Talk about expensive.
Edgeworth:
(Leaving the fact that it's on the expensive side aside... ...the fact that the cake crumbs and chocolate bits were found in this hallway... ...suggests that they came from a Swiss roll that was purchased from this machine.)
Partner
Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Notice anything?
Franziska:
This is a pretty spacious hallway, but it's nothing compared to the ones at home.
Edgeworth:
Indeed... (...because Mr. von Karma's house is a bit TOO spacious.)
Franziska:
However, even with this much space, there's nowhere for that scruff-face to hide. Well, other than the crime scene just beyond those doors.
Edgeworth:
Franziska, I believe it's much too early to draw any conclusions. (It was already proven that Detective Gumshoe was in this hallway the entire time. Now all we need to do is gather more information. And to do that, I'll just have to examine everything I see here by myself.)
Hallway window (after talking about "Time of the murder")
Franziska:
So, according to the Judge, someone looking through the restroom window... ...that you can see from the window at the end of this hall, can see into this hall? I wonder exactly how true that statement is, don't you?
Edgeworth:
Well, it IS possible to get a pretty clear view of this hallway from that restroom.
Franziska:
...Is there really a men's bathroom window through the window at the end of this hall?
Edgeworth:
Of course. ...Can you not see it?
Franziska:
...!
Edgeworth:
Arrnnngh!
Franziska:
I demand that you show me this view at once!
Edgeworth:
(I suppose I should go examine that window once again anyway...)
The crime scene (after gaining all logic)
Franziska:
We've gathered so much information, but they feel like just random fragments to me. I wonder what really happened here?
Edgeworth:
(Random fragments...? No matter how related they seem at first, they might actually fit together somehow.)
Franziska:
.........I grow tired of your inner monologues! Say something!
Edgeworth:
Arnngh! (I'm going to end up in pieces thanks to that whip before I can piece the logic together.)
Sofa (top side)
Before obtaining all Logic and examining handprint
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After obtaining all Logic and examining handprint
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Cactus
Edgeworth:
...Unnrgh!
Franziska:
What's the matter?
Edgeworth:
I pricked myself on one of this cactus's needles. I didn't think the needles on this thing would be so sharp.
Franziska:
Well? What did you expect? Can you imagine how bad it would be if you were hit on the head by one of these? Anyway, this cactus seems to be unrelated to our case.
Edgeworth:
Do you really think so? Because I believe that this cactus sitting on this windowsill (Windowsill cactus - Potted cactus sitting on the hallway window's windowsill. Its needles are dangerous.) is completely related.
Franziska:
...Oh? Well then, I look forward to your explanation on how exactly it is related.
Pink object
Edgeworth:
Hm? What... is this? It's a pink-colored piece of trash (Pink piece of trash - Piece of pink trash found on the windowsill of the hallway window. Made of rubber.)... made of rubber. Hmm... I feel like I've seen something like this before...
Franziska:
Well, all I see is a piece of garbage. But you know... the fact that there is a litterer running loose inside this courthouse... It's simply unforgivable!
Edgeworth:
Ack-! It's not like it was I who littered!
Franziska:
Rubbish belongs in a rubbish bin!
Edgeworth:
Gnnnrk!
Open window
Edgeworth:
I can look outside... however, I doubt the killer could've escaped through here.
Franziska:
Of course not. This IS the third floor, after all.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It appears that bars were installed on this to prevent people from falling out.
Franziska:
Bars? What bars?
Edgeworth:
...Can you not see them from your vantage point?
Franziska:
.........
Edgeworth:
Wh--!? (I must remember not to bring up that taboo subject again...)
Open window (after talking about "Time of the murder")
Edgeworth:
So that window on the other side belongs to the men's restroom...
Franziska:
...I can't see it.
Edgeworth:
At your height? I'm not surprised.
Franziska:
.........!
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooooooh! (I guess short people have feelings too!)
Ants
Edgeworth:
The ants are hard at work carrying their food home. It's a marvel that they can pick up such comparatively large objects to their size.
Franziska:
Well, if you want to carry the mighty Von Karma name and not be squished under it... ...you'd better work extra hard, just like these ants.
Edgeworth:
.........The same goes for you, Franziska.
Sofa (bottom side)
Sofa
Edgeworth:
Ants are pouring out of the hole in this bench as well. I wonder if the inside of this bench consists of nothing but ants...?
Franziska:
Don't you dare continue with that gross line of thought!
Edgeworth:
Unnrk! I-I'm sorry.
Pile of ants
Franziska:
What are these black speckles?
Edgeworth:
I believe it's a pile of ants, eating away.
Franziska:
Oooh... That detective...! He claims that not a single slipped by him... ...and yet, here is a whole hill of them!
Edgeworth:
Gnaaack! Wh-What are you hitting ME for!?
Franziska:
As a replacement for that pathetic detective!
Edgeworth:
Nngh... (Perhaps I should add this deduction to the detective's growing tab of pay cuts...)
Franziska:
Anyway, I wonder what the ants are eating?
Edgeworth:
From the look and sweet smell of it, pieces of cake and chocolate from a Swiss roll (Swiss roll crumbs - Found on the floor under the bench. A hill of ants are attracted to its sweet scent.).
Franziska:
...Miles Edgeworth... The courthouse is to be kept pristine at all times!
Edgeworth:
Nnghooooh! I-It wasn't me that dropped food on the ground!
Franziska:
The courthouse! Must be! Kept clean!
Edgeworth:
Nnnghooooooh!
Handprint
Edgeworth:
The dirt on this bench... It smells like some sort of sweet substance.
Franziska:
I can't believe there is someone going around dirtying the courthouse! For shame!
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
C-Calm down, Franziska... Now, take a good look. Doesn't this smudge look kind of like a handprint to you?
Franziska:
...I suppose it could be.
Edgeworth:
Which means... ...that perhaps we can lift the prints of the person who sullied this bench!
Franziska:
I see... And then, we'll know the identity of our mystery slob.
Edgeworth:
You there! The lab technician! Could you please find out who this handprint belongs to?
Forensics:
Sir! Yes, sir!
Forensics:
I've got the results of the fingerprint analysis, sir!
Edgeworth:
And? Do we know who they belong to?
Forensics:
Sir! The fingerprints belong to Detective Gumshoe!
Edgeworth:
Oh...? Interesting. Good work, officer.
Det. Gumshoe's Fingerprints data jotted down in my organizer.
Franziska:
And there you have it...
Edgeworth:
Yes, I suppose so.
Franziska:
Now we know the identity of the person who dirtied the bench...!
Edgeworth:
(.........I sense that you and I will be using this information in very different ways...)
Handprint (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
So the one who sullied the bench turns out to be Detective Gumshoe. We know thanks to the fingerprints he left.
Franziska:
What a slob, dirtying the bench like this! That scruff-face is going to receive a good whipping from me when next we meet!
Edgeworth:
(As if he isn't being punished enough by everything that's going on, Franziska...)
Tyrell Badd
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd, I have something I wish to inquire about...
Badd:
.........
Franziska:
Hey! How about doing some actual work, you!
Edgeworth:
...I wish to inquire into Detective Gumshoe's movement during the recess.
Badd:
...You're getting in the way of the investigation.
Edgeworth:
I have an order from Mr. von Karma himself. Plus, I still hold investigative authority.
Badd:
...Tch.
Detective Gumshoe
Edgeworth:
So I hear you were the one who called for Detective Gumshoe to come down here.
Badd:
...Faraday... That guy was just accused... you know? I just knew something was gonna happen... My detective instinct told me.
Franziska:
A lot of good it did you. You couldn't even protect one, lone prosecutor with it.
Badd:
............!
Franziska:
!
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Franziska, you need to apologize.
Franziska:
...Arghn...! ...I'm sorry.
Edgeworth:
I'm terribly sorry, Detective Badd. Please continue.
Badd:
.........Hmph. I used the phone on the first floor... and called the precinct... I told them to send somebody over. ...And that detective's the one that showed up.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... And only upon his arrival did you set Detective Gumshoe to stand guard, Detective Badd?
Badd:
...Yeah. I waited for him on the first floor... After he got here, we came up to these defendant lobbies together. ...As we entered this hallway, we ran into Yew... She told us... that Faraday was really mad... ...and that he'd dragged Rell off to Lobby No. 2 to have a word or something... And... that Faraday had said... to not let anyone interrupt them. ...So what choice did I have? ...All I could do was tell the big lug to stand guard outside.
Edgeworth:
And around what time did all of that take place?
Badd:
Let's see... I think it was about... 30 minutes before I heard the gunshot. After giving the big lug his assignment... he never left the hallway, not once...
Franziska:
Oh? And how can you make such a claim?
Badd:
Hmph... One of the guards out in this floor's main lobby swore to me he didn't.
Edgeworth:
If the detective never left the hallway... then where did he disappear off to?
Franziska:
Hmph. That's simple. He must have gone into Lobby No. 2, just as I suspected.
Badd:
Yew and I... We were in Lobby No. 1 next door. ...The only one without an alibi... is Gumshoe...
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... It would seem that I am still missing some key pieces of information.)
The gunshot
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd, you also heard the gunshot, did you not?
Badd:
...Yeah. I heard it when I was in Defendant Lobby No. 1... That's why I... came running towards Lobby No. 2 together with Yew...
Edgeworth:
How much time elapsed between you hearing the gunshot and your arrival on the scene?
Badd:
...Less than a minute.
Edgeworth:
What were your movements upon hearing the gunshot?
Badd:
I grabbed the big lug, who was just walking around in the hall... ...and raced into Lobby No. 2... And that's when we discovered the bodies... in that order.
Franziska:
That makes you the discoverer of the crime scene, right?
Badd:
...Yeah. I guess it does... little miss.
Franziska:
I am about to become a prosecutor very soon! You will treat me with the dignity I deserve, or else!
Badd:
Hmph. You wave that thing around any more... ...and I'll have you arrested for obstruction... little miss.
Franziska:
You wouldn't dare!
Badd:
Ha ha... Just joking.
Franziska:
Gnnnngh...
Edgeworth:
(Detective Badd is really something if he can make Franziska behave...!)
Badd:
...Are we... about done?
Edgeworth:
(Is there anything else I should ask him about...?)
Time he heard the gunshot
Leads to:
"I'd like for you to tell me the exact time you heard the gunshot."
Place he heard the gunshot
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd... Where were you when you heard the gunshot?
Badd:
...How many times are you going to ask that? I was in Defendant Lobby No. 1 when I heard the gunshot...
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... It's exactly the same as what he said earlier when I asked...)
Badd:
...Now, get out of here. ...You're getting in the way.
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I-I'm not through questioning you yet!
Leads back to:
"(Is there anything else I should ask him about...?)"
Situation around the gunshot
Edgeworth:
I'd like to know a little more about the circumstances under which you heard the gunshot.
Badd:
...Like I said, I was in Lobby No. 1 with Yew. ...I have nothing else to add.
Edgeworth:
(Well, his testimony certainly corroborates with what Ms. Yew said...)
Franziska:
Miles, you already asked him about that, remember?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... (I suppose I should ask about something else...)
Leads back to:
"(Is there anything else I should ask him about...?)"
Edgeworth:
I'd like for you to tell me the exact time you heard the gunshot.
Badd:
...It was around the end of the recess, and the trial was about to start again... I think. He was supposed to make time for himself to transfer the evidence he was holding... ...but I got the sense he wasn't gonna show for the hand-off... So I figured I should go get him, or he'd be late... And just as I thought that... Bang...! The sound of a gunshot hit my eyedrums...
Edgeworth:
(So he heard the gunshot right before the trial was about to re-start, huh...)
Det. Badd's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.
Present
KG-8 Incident Overview
Edgeworth:
The KG-8 Incident... I heard that you were involved in this case as well.
Badd:
...Yeah.
Edgeworth:
............
Badd:
............
Edgeworth:
...Th-That's all you have to say?
Badd:
...It was an unpleasant case that I don't wish to recall... I've got a lot of regrets I'll never forget related to that. Regrets I'll take to the grave.
Edgeworth:
(Does he really have that many regrets...? On the other hand, thinking back on what I know, I suppose he just might...)
Mr. Faraday's Fountain Pen
Badd:
Faraday...
Edgeworth:
It sounds like you lost someone close to you.
Badd:
...He was a battle-buddy. We fought through a lot together... A boy with a silver spoon in his mouth couldn't understand society's dark underbelly.
Edgeworth:
Grr... (Although, honestly, I suppose he's right. I don't have anyone I relate to in that way... Well, it's not as though I long for someone like that... Nor am I good at getting close...)
Det. Badd's Testimony
Badd:
It's just as I said... I have nothing further to add. But if there's one thing a detective honors, it's that... ...you must have confidence in, and take responsibility... for anything you say... That's what it means to be a detective...
Edgeworth:
(In other words, you're just another stubborn horse, aren't you, Detective?)
Anything else
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd, I'd like to ask you about this piece of evidence.
Badd:
..................
Franziska:
Hmph. What a narcissist! He'd rather look at his face than the evidence!
Badd:
...Don't trust your eyes all the time, little girl... I can see the evidence... and keep an eye on the two of you with this mirror...
Franziska:
What--!? Then why don't you answer!?
Badd:
Because I've got nothing to say... That's all.
Edgeworth:
...Understood. (Why couldn't he have just said that at the beginning?)
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Badd:
...Are we done here? I don't have any time to waste...
Hold it!
Franziska:
Oh, come on. All you're doing is standing in front of this door, doing nothing.
Badd:
.........Hmph.
Edgeworth:
(I get the sense that he is somewhat investigating this crime scene... Or rather, that he is keeping us under surveillance... But to what end...?) ...Detective Badd, may I ask that you cooperate with us for just a bit longer?
Badd:
...I don't have anything else to say.. to the two of you... You guys... were the ones who said you wanted to investigate in the first place.
Franziska:
Fine then! Be obstinate! We'll just do as we please! Come on, Miles!
Edgeworth:
...You may no longer be willing to help us, however... ...may I ask for the forensic scientists' cooperation?
Badd:
.........Do as you like...
Judge
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind. Where were you at the time of the murder?
Judge:
I-I-I-Do you suspect me of something!?
Edgeworth:
No, nothing of the sort, Your Honor...
Judge:
Ahem! V-Very well, you may continue with your testimony.
Edgeworth:
...Your Honor, it's your testimony I'm after.
Judge:
Oh! I had no idea you were chasing after me or my testimony...
Edgeworth:
(I'm beginning to sense that I might want to avoid being in a trial run by this judge...)
Time of the murder
Leads to:
"Let's see here... Now then, how should I put this...?"
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
Today's trial may have ended abruptly, but we will meet again.
Judge:
Ho ho ho. I'm looking forward to that day, Mr. Edgeworth.
Franziska:
When I become a prosecutor, you might even see me in your courtroom a few times. I hope you'll treat me with even greater respect than now.
Judge:
I-I only ask that you please do not bring a whip into my courtroom!
Franziska:
Hmph. I'm afraid that issue is not up for negotiation.
Edgeworth:
(As long as the whip can't reach his seat, I'm sure His Honor will be safe... I think.)
Swiss Roll
Judge:
Oh! It's a Courthouse Special Swiss Roll! It has such a nice, fluffy texture, and just the right amount of sweetness to it. And it's made from all-natural ingredients... ...so of course, it's easy to digest as well!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I see...
Judge:
Actually, they decided only recently to sell these rolls as the Courthouse Special. Of course, I've been sending in my special requests all along. Why don't you try sending in a request once in a while?
Edgeworth:
(I suppose I'll just have to think of a good suggestion by the next time I come here...)
Det. Badd's Testimony
Judge:
You wish to ask about Detective Badd? Well, he is one well-honored detective. He doesn't say much and he doesn't really like people, but he has quite a few wounds.
Edgeworth:
Yes, I figured as much...
Franziska:
He has such a bad habit of randomly treating people as through they were children.
Judge:
Ah, but if you were in pursuit of a criminal, there's no one I'd trust more with my life. Even in the middle of a fierce gunfight, Detective Badd doesn't lose his cool.
Edgeworth:
Aren't you exaggerating just a bit? I mean, what detective doesn't value his or her life?
Judge:
No, no, you don't understand. He got all those holes in his jacket from all the gunfights he's gotten in fighting crime! You should learn about him if you want to be a part of the world of law enforcement.
Edgeworth:
(Something tells me that I should strive to stay on that detective's good side...)
Anything else
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I'd like for you to please take a look at this piece of evidence.
Judge:
Very well. The court will accept this into evidence.
Edgeworth:
N-No, wait! That's not what I showed it to you for!
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth. If I may, I suggest you bone up on court procedure a bit more. When evidence is shown before me, it goes into evidence. That is the law of the court.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor... I'm sorry to say this, however, that rule does not apply to the outside world.
Judge:
Hmm, come to think of it, I suppose court is not in session right now.
Edgeworth:
(...Being passionate about one's work is one thing, but to confuse it with real life...)
Judge:
Let's see here... Now then, how should I put this...? When you get to be my age... you need to pay more frequent visits to the restroom.
Edgeworth:
Hmm...
Judge:
If you go take a look through the window at the end of this hall, you'll see a small window. That is the window to the men's restroom. In other words, you can see clearly into this hallway from the men's restroom.
Edgeworth:
..................
Judge:
When I was going into the restroom, that detective... Gumshoe, is it...? Well, he was standing in front of the vending machines buying something from it.
Edgeworth:
...Hmm...
Judge:
However! And this I couldn't believe... When I was about to exit the restroom... ...there was not a soul in the hallway anymore!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor... If you could please calm down and explain it to me rationally...
Judge:
Oh! I'm really sorry. Please let me regain my composure... It was really suspicious! That's what my finely-honed judge's intuition said! Although, well, until the murders occurred, I just sort of brushed it off. Ho ho ho.
Edgeworth:
(Apparently, this judge doesn't understand the concept of "staying calm"... That's probably all I'm going to find out from His Honor...)
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth, may I return to my other duties now?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I'm sorry to have held you up. Thank you for your cooperation, Your Honor.
Judge:
Ho ho ho. Anytime, Mr. Edgeworth! Anytime!
Franziska:
The judges in this country seem rather friendly.
Edgeworth:
Yes... if not a little wishy-washy. However, I hear that they are known to hand down very fair verdicts.
Vending machine on left
First time
Franziska:
Hmm... It would appear that this vending machine (Vending machine - A vending machine that sells Courthouse Special goods. A few sweet items are for sale.) sells snacks and various other foods.
Edgeworth:
Just lovely. What will they think of next?
Franziska:
"Don't be a jerk in court like these beef jerks!" ......One packet for $9. "Defendant's Fresh Milk!" ......One half-pint for $7. "Stay neutral as the Swiss do until the end with these!" ......For $6. ...They're awfully overpriced.
Edgeworth:
(The line-up is simply awful. Period.)
Franziska:
Speaking of snacks... I wonder if that Swiss roll the little girl dropped is from this machine?
Edgeworth:
Hmm, I was wondering about that myself.
Subsequent times
Edgeworth:
(I've already finished examining this area, but it never hurts to look again.)
Hot dog
Edgeworth:
"When you're in hot water, you might need a hot dog." .................. Hmm... It looks like this slogan was decided through a public contest. And the winner was... Prosecutor Winston Payne...?
Franziska:
Hmph. What a pathetic slogan. No presence at all! Now if it was up to me, it would read... "If you leave matters in a Von Karma's hands, everyone in court will be found guilty dogs!"
Edgeworth:
............
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Franziska:
Overruled!
Beef jerky
Edgeworth:
"Don't be a jerk in court like these beef jerks!" I see...
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! Wouldn't you agree that it's a very clever pun?
Edgeworth:
Do you really think they that much effort into the product name?
Franziska:
Even a foolish fool could understand the foolish thinking of the fool who made it up! You're acting so foolishly that I got so thoroughly mad, and am now utterly famished!
Edgeworth:
......If you wanted a pack of these, all you had to do was ask like a normal person.
Ham sandwich
Edgeworth:
"Don't let the prosecution and the defense make a ham sandwich out of you!"...?
Franziska:
It sounds like it's directed at that ham of a Judge.
Edgeworth:
Well, it certainly isn't directed at me. I can out-maneuver him any day.
Orange juice
Edgeworth:
"When it's looking bad, blind your opposition with some OJ!" Are they promoting violence?
Franziska:
Don't worry. My whip will make sure that anybody following this advice won't be for long.
Edgeworth:
(Compared to the sting of a whip, the sting of orange juice may not be so bad...)
Milk
Edgeworth:
"Defendant's Fresh Milk!"... What exactly is that supposed to mean?
Franziska:
I bet it means that the milk is freshly milked by various defendants on trial right now.
Edgeworth:
No, I think it might mean that this was milked right here from the various defendants.
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth... You can't possibly be serious!
Edgeworth:
...Of course not.
Swiss rolls
Franziska:
"Stay neutral as the Swiss do until the end with these!" ...The end of what?
Edgeworth:
Well, I assume it means the end of the trial. I suppose this means that one should eat these during a recess...?
Franziska:
You can't eat during a trial, so I suppose the only time you can eat them is now, huh!
Edgeworth:
I wouldn't mind if you wanted to eat one now. They come in packs of two, after all.
Franziska:
Hmph. We're in the middle of an investigation! Besides, I don't have $6 on me!
Edgeworth:
If you want, we can pool our money and buy a pack together.
Franziska:
If I have to split it with you, then I don't want it!
Vending machine on right
Franziska:
It doesn't look like there's anything contradictory left in this area...
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I suppose not. (Perhaps I should check somewhere else.)
Forensics under vending machine
Edgeworth:
Did you find something, officer?
Forensics:
I think there's a 5 dollar bill back there! ...Come on... ...Just a little more...
Franziska:
Is there no one working this crime scene who isn't a total waste of living tissue?
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a single person we can deem useful here.
Forensics examining door
Edgeworth:
Have you found any suspicious fingerprints, officer?
Forensics:
Nope. Just the fingerprints of those involved with the case, sir.
Franziska:
I guess we know all of the players in this case then, huh?
Edgeworth:
It would appear that way... but I have the nagging feeling that we're missing something. (And I suspect that what we're missing is hiding right here in this crime scene somewhere!)
Poster
Franziska:
...He's making a most ridiculous-looking face.
Edgeworth:
That may be, but at least he doesn't look like someone who would tell a lie on purpose.
Franziska:
I suppose. But to a Von Karma, evidence is the only thing that carries any weight.
Edgeworth:
Of course. At any rate, this poster seems to be of no use to us right now.
Fire extinguisher
Edgeworth:
There are mo signs that this fire extinguisher was used in the crime.
Franziska:
If you could already tell from a distance, then why are you wasting your time examining it?
Edgeworth:
Franziska, let's not try to rush absolute genius.
(Connecting "Vending machine" and "Swiss roll crumbs" Logic and examining handprint leads to:)
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I think I have a pretty clear picture of what happened here now.
Franziska:
Hmph. Naturally. After all, I'm here, aren't I?
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe must have sat on this bench as he ate a Swiss Roll. And as he ate, he dropped it on the floor, and sullied the bench.
Det. Gumshoe's Fingerprints data updated in my Organizer.
Franziska:
Ugh! How could he have not cleaned up after himself!? How utterly despicable!
Edgeworth:
Don't dare you whip me again! It wasn't I who made the mess in the first place! Anyway... If it was indeed Detective Gumshoe who bought the Swiss roll... ...that creates a rather interesting contradiction of facts.
Franziska:
A contradiction... Where?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I think another look at the special courthouse vending machine is in order.
Partner
Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Crime scene oddity
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! That contradiction you were talking about... I demand that you show it to me at once!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... (If Detective Gumshoe really did buy a pack of Swiss rolls for himself... ...that fact creates a contradiction with what I know about this case!) Hmph... Are you telling me that you haven't figured it out yourself, yet, Franziska?
Franziska:
O-Of course I've figured it out! But I thought I'd let you have the glory, just this once.
Edgeworth:
(She really doesn't like to lose, does she...?)
Present
Swiss Roll (after deduce)
Franziska:
It looks like this Swiss roll was bought from the vending machine in the hallway. I heard that it has a nice, fluffy texture, and just the right amount of sweetness. And it's made from all natural ingredients... ...so of course, it's easy to digest as well! ...Or so I've heard. ..................
Edgeworth:
.................. ...Franziska, if you want one, I'd appreciate it if you would just tell me so.
Franziska:
I-I never said I wanted one! And besides, if I did, I'd make you prepare me some milk to go along with it!
Edgeworth:
(At that time, I hope you will be more direct, instead of playing these mind-games.)
Vending machine on left
Before deducing
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After deducing
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Deduce
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce Swiss Rolls and and present Annual Bonus Envelope
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"About Detective Gumshoe's finances, he said that until this morning..."
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
There is clearly a contradiction here!
Franziska:
...Do you think so?
Edgeworth:
...I think there is one.
Franziska:
......
Edgeworth:
...I think there should be one.
Franziska:
Do not anger me with a foolish game of semantics, Miles!
Edgeworth:
Gnnnuurk! (Nngh... I'd better look a bit more carefully through my evidence once again...)
Edgeworth:
About Detective Gumshoe's finances, he said that until this morning... ...he didn't have even a single penny on his personage.
Franziska:
Just how poor is that guy!?
Edgeworth:
If his bonus really was only $5... ...then, he should not have been able to purchase a pack of Swiss rolls! However, facts being as they are, we found cake crumbs on the floor.
Franziska:
...Meaning Scruffy must've bought a pack somehow.
Edgeworth:
Indeed... (That detective should not have been able to purchase a pack, and yet he did... The question is, "How?")
Swiss Roll data updated in my Organizer.
Examine evidence
Front side of Swiss Roll (after deduce)
Edgeworth:
I can't believe they're selling Swiss rolls like these in vending machines these days.
Franziska:
Yes, and I can't believe it's $6 for two... I mean, who charges that much for a commoner's junk food!?
Edgeworth:
Franziska... If you want one, all you have to do is buy one for yourself.
Franziska:
Wh--!? I'm working right now! It won't do for me to eat while there's a case to be solved!
Edgeworth:
Gnnnrgh! (Your idea of working must be vastly different from my own!)
(Connecting all possible Logic, clearing all "Talk" options of Badd and Judge, and deducing vending machine leads to:)
Investigation Complete
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I believe I now have a very firm grasp on what happened here.
Franziska:
Arnngh! ...W-Well, I do, too!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Alright, Franziska. Would you care to share what conclusions you've come to?
Franziska:
Wh-Why should I do that!? We're still in the middle of a competition, you know! We should be checking to see if your conclusions are wrong first, so you go ahead!
Edgeworth:
(It's almost cute that she's going this far to ensure that she wins... Almost.) Very well. But first, we need to pay His Honor a visit to correct his testimony.
September 10, 5:15 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, if I may, I'd like to test your witness testimony to see how it stands up.
Judge:
D-Do you doubt me!? Am I your new suspect!?
Edgeworth:
...In a sense, I suppose you could say that.
Franziska:
Even you, a judge... ...is nothing but a common witness before a Von Karma!
Judge:
Silence in the courtroom! Silence, I said! Mr. New Prosecutor Recommended by Manfred von Karma Miles Edgeworth... ...and Ms. Genius Prosecutor Successor to Manfred von Karma Franzisk...ack...!
Franziska:
...You bit your tongue again, didn't you?
Judge:
...Ahem. As a defender of the law, I could never give false testimony! You can even place me under oath if you want!
Edgeworth:
Very well, then. Your testimony, if you please.
Judge:
Hmm...
-- What I Saw at Recess --
Judge:
During the recess... I, um... I went to the restroom.
There is a window on the hallway side. In other words, I could see into the hallway.
As I entered, I saw that detective buying something from the vending machines.
But when I was about to exit the restroom, he had completely disappeared!
A detective that goes missing while on duty... That sounds mighty suspicious to meeeee!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor... Can you please try to remain calm?
Judge:
Oh! I'm so used to simply listening to testimonies that I got caught up in the excitement.
Edgeworth:
(I'm sorry, Your Honor, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to spoil your fun now.)
Rebuttal
-- What I Saw at Recess --
Judge:
During the recess... I, um... I went to the restroom.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor... Why exactly did you pay a visit to the restroom, if I may ask?
Judge:
Oh! Well, isn't it obvious!? What else do you go to the restroom for!? Or, maybe... I-I-I-I-I knew it...! You suspect me of some sort of tomfoolery, don't you!
Edgeworth:
Please stay calm, Your Honor! (This is going to be much harder than I anticipated...)
Judge:
I-I'm sorry... You're right... I need to think things through with a level head. I'm just nervous because so much has happened today with this trial. Let's see... I announced a recess, and a time for us to reconvene... But having done all that, I still wasn't able to go the restroom right away.
Edgeworth:
And why couldn't you?
Judge:
Mr. Faraday had been accused, so I had a paperwork to process regarding a new prosecutor. Once I had finished that, I was finally able to make a mad dash to the restroom.
Edgeworth:
(At least he stayed consistent on the "going to the restroom" part of his testimony...)
Judge:
There is a window on the hallway side. In other words, I could see into the hallway.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, did you really go to the men's restroom?
Judge:
Wh-Wh--!? What is the meaning of that statement!?
Edgeworth:
I simply meant... that perhaps you went to a restroom on a different floor.
Judge:
I had to go for such a long time... It was all I could do to dash to the closest one to the courtroom.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... I suppose that's only natural, given his circumstances...)
Judge:
I ran from the courtroom, through this floor's main lobby and down the hallway. Once you enter, you can see there's a window just above the urinals.
Edgeworth:
And it was through that window that you witnessed Detective Gumshoe, Your Honor?
Judge:
Yes, exactlyyyyyyy!
Edgeworth:
Y-Your Honor! There is no need to yell! I can hear you just fine!
Judge:
Oh! I guess I put a little too much into that last answer. Now then, let's continue with the testimony.
Judge:
As I entered, I saw that detective buying something from the vending machines.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you sure that the person you witnessed was Detective Gumshoe, Your Honor?
Judge:
Yes, I'm absolutely sure. It's hard to miss someone of his statue, even from as far away as the restroom. Besides, I can't think of anyone else with that kind of hairstyle and big, beige coat.
Edgeworth:
Well, I was simply wondering if you were mistaken in what you saw...
Judge:
What!? Preposterous! My eyes are as sharp as can be! Ready to see through lies to the truth! Although, recently, things do seem to become a bit fuzzier than they used to be...
Edgeworth:
(Clearly, his eyes are not the only things that have gone fuzzy!)
Judge:
But allow me to say with all the honor and dignity of a judge... ...I am not mistaken in what I saw!
Judge:
But when I was about to exit the restroom, he had completely disappeared!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
He disappeared? But Your Honor, didn't you just say... ..."I saw that detective buying something from the vending machines"?
Judge:
Why, yes! Yes, I did! The restroom window looks over the courtyard and right into the hallway. But! Just as I was about to exit, I took another look, and there was no one in sight! .................. That led me to the only solution to this mystery. That detective must've gone into the crime scene, Lobby No. 2 at that pooooooooooint!
Edgeworth:
(So he looked into the hallway from the restroom, and over the courtyard, did he...?)
Present Det. Gumshoe's Fingerprints
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wh-What was that finger wag for, Mr. Edgeworth!?"
Judge:
A detective that goes missing while on duty... That sounds mighty suspicious to meeeee!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I ask that you please remain calm.
Judge:
Nononononononononono! I-I-I-I'm cerfectly palm!
Edgeworth:
(You're being anything but "perfectly calm"!)
Franziska:
It appears that His Honor could not have been mistaken in what he saw.
Edgeworth:
Hmph, I suppose so, given his line of sight. However, Franziska, why do you suppose our lines of sight are so different?
Franziska:
...If you're referring to my height...
Edgeworth:
C-Can't you hold that whip still for just a second!? Now, about His Honor's testimony... ...I believe his line of sight to be an important factor.
Franziska:
If it's that important, why don't you hurry up and tell him already?
Edgeworth:
(I will, but there is one more thing I need to do if I am to correct His Honor's testimony. I am going to need to retrace Detective Gumshoe's movements!)
Judge:
Wh-What was that finger wag for, Mr. Edgeworth!? And don't you know it's rude to shout "Objection!" while someone is giving testimony?
Edgeworth:
Hah. If you truly are a man of the law, then you must always be vigilant. For example, I, myself, never let an opportunity to shout "Objection!" pass me by!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth. It's one thing to be passionate about your job, but this is real life.
Edgeworth:
(This is what some people may say is the pot calling the kettle black...) Your Honor, I wonder if you might take a look at this for me?
Judge:
What is that filth!? How dare someone dirty the hallway bench like that!? Who is the culprit!? That party is hereby found GUILTY of uncleanliness!!!
Edgeworth:
If you must know, the uncouth bench sullier... ...has already been placed under arrest, thanks to your earlier testimony, Your Honor.
Judge:
Oh? ...Well that's good. But who was it?
Edgeworth:
We were able to discover something from the smudge on the bench. Namely, Detective Gumshoe's fingerprints.
Judge:
Not happy with committing just murder, he had to go and dirty the courthouse, too!? GUILTY!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. Please calm down. While it's true that the detective is the one who made the mess on the bench... ...we have not yet established that this action is related to the double murder.
Judge:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
I believe that the Detective bought a pack of Swiss rolls from the vending machine... ...and then, promptly sat down on the bench to eat one. The cake crumbs and pieces of chocolate on the floor under the bench... ...and Detective Gumshoe's fingerprints prove my conclusions to be true.
Judge:
Oh... But I still don't understand. Is the whole thing related to how I couldn't see him as I was leaving the restroom?
Edgeworth:
Heh... It is indeed! The window in the hallway was built rather high up into the wall... ..at around a grown adult's chest height. As evidence, I submit that Franziska herself was unable to see out of that window.
Franziska:
.........
Edgeworth:
Nnghooooh! (I knew I shouldn't have used her height as evidence!) ...B-Basically, what this means is that the area directly under the hallway window... ...is a blind spot when the hallway is being viewed from the men's restroom!
Judge:
Th-Then!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... It seems that you have made the connection. If someone were to sit on the bench under the window... Yes, even someone as large as Detective Gumshoe... ...would effectively disappear from sight!
Judge:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Do you finally see, Your Honor? Your testimony has just proven that Detective Gumshoe was in the hallway the entire time.
Hold it!
Judge:
...Ah! Sorry! I didn't mean to say it with that much enthusiasm. All I wanted to do was try saying it once. Here, let me try that again... "Hold it!"
Edgeworth:
...Is there something of value that you'd like to say?
Judge:
Yes, actually, there is! I remembered something else just now! Mr. Edgeworth! Please allow me to testify to the court one more time!
Franziska:
Even if we overruled him, he'd just keep on talking, wouldn't he?
Edgeworth:
That might not be a bad thing. The more info the better in a perfect investigation, right?
-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --
Judge:
I suppose it's possible you can't see a seated person from the restroom window.
However, that doesn't mean that the Detective was sitting there when I looked!
Anyway! I forgot to testify earlier about probably the most important detail...
As I was leaving the restroom, I heard the loud "BANG!" of a gunshot!
Edgeworth:
Gnnnnrrrrrk...
Judge:
How was that!? That is the testimony of one who judges the crimes of others!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor... Could you try to state the important facts first next time!?
Franziska:
I agree! Before you go around judging others, you should learn to judge your own words!
Judge:
Eeeek! ...I-I'm sorry! But honestly, I thought that sound was just a noise popper until just now!
Edgeworth:
(Now that he mentions it, right before we re-started the trial, he did talk about that...)
Judge:
Oh, by the way, was there someone celebrating a birthday during the recess? I could have sworn that I heard a popper going off... Come to think of it... The other day with my grandson...
Edgeworth:
(The most critical point in this argument is when did the Judge look into the hallway? And whether that lines up with when the gun was actually fired.) Your Honor, if I may... I'd like to clarify a few details in your testimony!
Rebuttal
-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --
Judge:
I suppose it's possible you can't see a seated person from the restroom window.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
In that case, do you concede that you were overconfident in your last testimony?
Judge:
N-Now hold on there! I just said that it's possible you can't see a seated person from the restroom this time! But you know something? I don't think you know when the prints you referenced were left on that bench, do you!?
Edgeworth:
Nngh!
Judge:
While you have proven that it's possible the Detective was sitting... ...I still have a problem with just when those fingerprints were left.
Edgeworth:
(He's right. I have yet to prove when the fingerprints were left on that bench... While he feigns ignorance. His Honor has seen a lot of life... This Judge... I mustn't underestimate him!)
Judge:
However, that doesn't mean that the Detective was sitting there when I looked!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
As we established, you went to the restroom during the recess. However, at what point in the recess did you look into that hallway?
Judge:
Hmm... After I called for a recess, I handled the change of prosecutor paperwork... Maybe about 20 minutes until we reconvened...? Yes, that sounds about right.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Just as I expected.
Judge:
Wh-What were you expecting? And I demand to know what that all-knowing smile is for!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor... That statement you made just now is very important. I'd like for you to append it to your testimony.
Judge:
A-Alright. If you insist.
Add statement:
"Let's see... I looked into the hallway about 20 minutes before we were to reconvene."
Judge:
Let's see... I looked into the hallway about 20 minutes before we were to reconvene.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Twenty minutes before we reconvened... Very well, what did you do after that?
Judge:
Let's see... I had to make some preparations, so I rushed straight back to the courtroom. I also had to track down a few pieces of paperwork for the various bailiffs.
Edgeworth:
So you rushed back to the courtroom, despite having just heard a gunshot?
Judge:
Well, at the time... I thought it was just the sound of a noise popper. I really couldn't think of any other explanation than someone having a birthday party. But now... Now that this has happened...
Edgeworth:
I see... (Thinking back, the Judge did mention something to that effect when we reconvened...)
Present Det. Badd's Testimony
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Your Hon--"
Judge:
Anyway! I forgot to testify earlier about probably the most important detail...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
If it's something that forgettable, I don't need to hear it!
Judge:
Eek! B-But! All I did was forget to mention it!
Franziska:
That sort of excuse may work on other people, but not on a Von Karma!
Judge:
Oh! But it's such an important piece of testimony! Please give me a chance to present it!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I suppose I have no choice in the matter.
Judge:
As I was leaving the restroom, I heard the loud "BANG!" of a gunshot!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, about what you just said...
Judge:
I know! I couldn't believe it myself! But I heard it! "BANG!" went the gunshot! I heard it loud and clear! And then I had a knee-jerk reaction, "Aah!" and jumped into the air! Like this! Yes, just like this! With a quick, "Aah!"
Edgeworth:
......Your Honor. Please remain calm when you're trying to explain yourself to me.
Judge:
Yes, sir! Sorry about that. Now then, I must gather myself, yes... When I heard the gunshot, there was no one in the hall! I should know! I looked! There was no one theeeeeeere!
Edgeworth:
(This judge's emotion circuits appear to be stuck on "overreact".)
Franziska:
At this point, nothing stands out to me as a contradiction in his testimony...
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Franziska. If I'm correct, this testimony is hardly precision quality.
Franziska:
...I know that. And that's why I said, "At this point."
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I think my first line of attack will be to draw more information from His Honor.
After the additional statement has been added
Edgeworth:
I belive... that we've finally found the flaw in His Honor's testimony.
Franziska:
Yet sadly, he's completely oblivious to it. But I guess I can't really expect him to be aware of it. Well? What are you waiting for!? Hurry up and fill him in! ...At least that thing finally came in handy.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Now let's see what happens... ...when I present it to His Honor!
Edgeworth:
Your Hon--
Judge:
I cannot allow you to make an objection.
Edgeworth:
What!? Your Honor... I'm really sorry, but... ...I cannot allow you to not allow me to make an objection!
Judge:
Egads! I've been overruled!?
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, there are simply too many holes in your testimony for my taste.
Judge:
Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean by that!?
Edgeworth:
You claim that you heard the gunshot during the recess, but that is simply not possible!
Judge:
! Mr. New Prosecutor Recommended by Manfred von...ack...!
Franziska:
Instead of biting your tongue, why don't you bite your tongue on those preposterous names!?
Judge:
Eek!
Edgeworth:
I see you have no mercy for the elderly either, Franziska.
Franziska:
Hmph. Don't talk back to me, unless you want to be whipped in the back.
Edgeworth:
(With your height, you'd need a step-ladder or four to accomplish that.)
Judge:
Ahem! Mr. Edgeworth. My ears are not that far gone yet, I'll have you know! I can still hear just fine! And I heard the sound of a gunshot loud and clear with my own two ears!
Edgeworth:
Hah... Your Honor, I have here an interesting bit of testimony. It's from Detective Badd. And according to him, he heard the gunshot "right before the trial was about to start again".
Judge:
Wh-What did you just say!?
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, you just said... ...that you heard the gunshot "about 20 minutes before we were to reconvene". How do you explain this glaring contradiction!?
Judge:
Th-That can't beeeeeee!
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately... that is the truth.
Judge:
B-But! I heard it clear as day! "BANG!" The loud sound of a gunshot!
Edgeworth:
(The sound of the gunshot... We keep returning to this point of contention. And that piece of evidence... I always did wonder why I found it where I did. However, now I understand what that gunshot the Judge heard really was!) Unfortunately, Your Honor, this is what really produced the gunshot you heard!
Present Balloon Piece
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I found this object in the hallway earlier."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth... I have no idea what you are trying to say with that piece.
Edgeworth:
Franziska... You're just still too young to understand.
Franziska:
Stop trying to fool me, and start being mature enough to admit when you're wrong!
Edgeworth:
Gnnrrk! (Perhaps that was not the piece I needed to show...)
Leads back to:
"Unfortunately, Your Honor, this is what really produced the gunshot you heard!"
Edgeworth:
I found this object in the hallway earlier.
Judge:
Wh-What is that pink substance?
Edgeworth:
It may not look it, but this is actually a piece of a balloon.
Judge:
I see. And I suppose you would like me to accept that pink balloon into the court record?
Edgeworth:
Your Honor... I present this piece of evidence in order to overrule your testimony!
Judge:
Wh-What!?
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, your argument goes as follows: You saw no one in the hallway when you heard the gunshot. Now, there is no guarantee that the detective was sitting on the bench at that time... ...therefore, you believe he must have been at the crime scene, Defendant Lobby No. 2. ...Am I correct?
Judge:
Yes, that's exactly right.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Let me ask you something. Do you think that the gunshot you heard was produced by a real gun?
Judge:
!
Edgeworth:
I think I've said enough that even you can figure the rest out on your own. Your Honor. You were fooled by the popping of this balloon into thinking it was a gunshot!
Judge:
Wh-What manner of trickery is thiiiiiiiiiiiiis!?
Franziska:
That was a good effort you put forth, Miles Edgeworth. But if it was me, I'd have wrapped this thing up before the Judge even testified.
Edgeworth:
(Care to elaborate on how one ends something before it even begins...?)
Judge:
Hmm... Well, to be honest... I did think that the sound was a bit off from a real gunshot sound... But who could've guessed... that someone would pop a balloon in a place like this?
Edgeworth:
(That's true... One doesn't usually think "balloons" in conjunction with "courthouse".)
???:
Umm... I want to trade these coins with you!
Edgeworth:
(That's it...! That balloon that girl was holding... it explains everything.) Your Honor, if it makes you feel any better, you didn't lie once in your testimony. However, I can't really vouch for its accuracy...
Judge:
Mmnngh... Who knew... that giving testimony could be such a difficult thing to do...? What have I done? I owe Detective Gumshoe a very, very big apology... I will see to it myself that he is released...!
Edgeworth:
Wait... There are still a few things I have yet to resolve about what happened in the hallway. Your Honor, I request your permission to further question Detective Gumshoe.
Judge:
B-But why!? I thought we just cleared his name!?
Edgeworth:
Whether we did just now or not... I still cannot say. The only think I can do for now is to continue in my quest for the perfect explanation. And to that end... ...I must resolve the remaining issues pertaining to the events that occurred in the hallway!
Judge:
Very well. Bailiff! Please bring Detective Gumshoe into the courtroom!
Edgeworth:
(I must fulfill my mission, and find the perfect explanation to this case!)
September 10District CourtCourtroom No. 3
Gumshoe:
Wh-What is it now!? Is it time for my trial already!? I've already told you a gazillion times, pal! I didn't do it! 
Edgeworth:
I'll be the judge of that, Detective Gumshoe.
Franziska:
No, you won't! I'll be the judge of that!
Judge:
No, no, no, no, no! I'M the judge around here! And I'LL be the judge of that!
Gumshoe:
Why can't you guys be a little less judgmental...?
Judge:
Yes, well, speaking of hasty judgements, Detective Gumshoe... I'm afraid I must apologize for an error in judgement on my part.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. I don't believe you should apologize just yet. We have yet to prove he is completely innocent of this crime.
Judge:
I-I guess so...
Gumshoe:
? Um, what are you guys talking about?
Edgeworth:
...In any case. I would like you to testify as to your actions while you were on guard duty. And please remember, you are not on trial. This is all just a part of the investigation. As such, you may still be found to be innocent... ...however, if you should give false testimony...
Gumshoe:
Yeeeeoooow!
Franziska:
My whip will object, loud and clear!
Edgeworth:
If you are found to be lying, you will be held indefinitely. Understood?
Gumshoe:
.........I gotcha, pal.
Edgeworth:
(Thinking back on the state of the crime scene and the Judge's testimony... ...it's obvious that Detective Gumshoe is lying. And if I can't break his lie, then we may never get a break in this case!)
-- While I was on Duty --
Gumshoe:
I came down here to this courthouse on Detective Badd's orders.
As soon as I got here, he ordered me to stand guard in front of Lobby No. 2.
From that time on, until I heard the gunshot, I was in the hallway the whole time!
On my honor as a detective, I swear it wasn't me, pal!
Franziska:
He's still singing the same tired tune.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. In that case, I'll just have to change the melody. (I know he's lying, and it's time I pulled the information I need out of him!)

-- While I was on Duty --
Gumshoe:
I came down here to this courthouse on Detective Badd's orders.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, was it really Detective Badd who called you down here?
Gumshoe:
You bet it was, pal! I was left in charge of the precinct while everyone was out, and this call comes in... "I want you down here in one minute flat!" he said! Well, I thought this was my big chance, my first case, so I made a mad dash down here! Although, I couldn't exactly get here in a minute flat...
Edgeworth:
So how long did it take you?
Gumshoe:
Umm... About then minutes, I guess.
Edgeworth:
And what was Detective Badd doing when you finally made it?
Gumshoe:
He was waiting for me down on the first floor in the entrance way, pal!
Gumshoe:
As soon as I got here, he ordered me to stand guard in front of Lobby No. 2.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
And by "he", you mean...?
Gumshoe:
Detective Badd, of course! And, this being my first time at this courthouse... ...he also walked with me up to the 3rd floor hallway in front of the defendant lobbies!
Edgeworth:
And did you meet anyone along the way?
Gumshoe:
Hmm... Well... Just as we entered the hallway, we ran into Ms. Yew. When he heard from Ms. Yew that Mr. Faraday was not to be interrupted... ...that's when Detective Badd told me to stand guard in the hallway, pal!
Edgeworth:
(So far, Detective Gumshoe's testimony is matching up with Detective Badd's...)
Gumshoe:
From that time on, until I heard the gunshot, I was in the hallway the whole time!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You claim to have been in that hallway the "whole time"... ...however, is it not a fact that you did something while you were in that hallway?
Gumshoe:
O-Of course I did something! I guarded the door to Lobby No. 2, pal! What else!?
Edgeworth:
Very well, then. And what exactly does guarding that door entail?
Gumshoe:
Umm... Well, to put it simply... Oh, I know! It was my job to stand in front of the door without moving an inch!
Edgeworth:
Oh? Detective Gumshoe, you mean to tell me... ...that you didn't take a single step away from the door to Lobby No. 2? Is that really what you wish to testify to the effect of?
Gumshoe:
You got it, pal! I didn't take a single step away from that door, just like I was ordered not to!
Franziska:

Judge:

Edgeworth:

Gumshoe:
Wh-Why is everyone so quiet all of a sudden?
Edgeworth:
Because we are all in shock... ...and in awe of your utter stupidity.
Franziska:
Scruffy! If you're going to lie, at least tell us a more believable one!
Gumshoe:
Yeeeeowch! B-But I... I'm not lying...
Edgeworth:
(I should hurry up and bring this insipid testimony to a close.)
Change statement:
"From that time on, until I heard the gunshot, I was in the hallway the whole time!" to "And until I heard the gunshot, I didn't take a single step away from the Lobby No. 2 door."
Gumshoe:
And until I heard the gunshot, I didn't take a single step away from the Lobby No. 2 door.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I'm only going to ask you one more time, Detective Gumshoe. Are you sure you stood in front of the door to Lobby No. 2 the entire time?
Gumshoe:
Yup! After I was told to by Detective Badd... ...I stood guard in front of that door without a single break! S-So believe me when I say that I was in that hallway the whole time already, pal!
Franziska:

Apparently, someone has a bit of trouble reading between the lines.

Wh-What's that supposed to mean!? I don't...!
Franziska:
Be quiet!
Gumshoe:

Leads to:
"I have... an objection."
Gumshoe:
On my honor as a detective, I swear it wasn't me, pal!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Would you also be willing to swear that there was no one else in that hall besides you?
Gumshoe:
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you talking about!? I just swore to you that I was doing my job, pal!
Edgeworth:
Oh? Then what are you acting so nervous for?
Gumshoe:
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What!? I'm not nervous at all, pal! Anyway! Not a single person other than myself was in that hall the whole time!
Edgeworth:
(I should just let it go... Pursuing this train of thought at this time would just be a waste of time...)
Franziska:
He's still singing the same tired tune.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. In that case, I'll just have to change the melody. (I know he's lying, and it's time I pulled the information I need out of him!)
After the additional statement has been added
Franziska:
To have such a foolishly foolish contradiction... ... in such a foolishly foolish testimony is just plain old foolish.
Edgeworth:
...Indeed. However, in the pursuit of the perfect investigation, I'm afraid we have to deal with it. By Squashing it under the weight of the evidence!
Edgeworth:
I have... an objection.
Gumshoe:
Wh--!? Wh-Wh-Wh-What is it, pal!?
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe... I wonder if you might recognize this from somewhere?
Gumshoe:
Hey! It's one of those things! The Courthouse Special Swiss Rolls, right pal!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Precisely. In that case, I suppose... ...that you also recall the sullied hallway bench?
Gumshoe:
Hey! You know what!? I think it was probably me that did that!
Judge:
Detective Gumshoe! You know you can't go around dirtying up the courthouse like this!
Franziska:
You inconsiderate, slovenly pig!
Gumshoe:
Eeeek! I promise to clean it up later! I swear!
Edgeworth:
Now then, shall we get down to business? About the fact that you didn't move even a single step from in front of that door... If that really were the case, then how were you able to buy a pack of Swiss rolls!?
Gumshoe:
Aaaaaack!
Franziska:
Furthermore, if you didn't move a single step from in front of that door... ...how did you manage to get the bench dirty with your grubby hands!?
Gumshoe:
Yeeeeeeeeeeeowwwwwwwwch!
Edgeworth:
(It appears that Franziska's whip can do more damage than my words alone can...)
Gumshoe:
A-Alright... I confess, pal. I was hungry, so I bought a pack for myself, OK!? I thought I'd get chewed out again if anyone found out about me eating on the job... ...so I didn't want to say anything!
Judge:
Well, unfortunately for you, I saw you do the whole dastardly deed! I clearly saw you buying a pack of Swiss rolls from the vending machine!
Gumshoe:
*sigh* OK, OK, I'm sorry for lying! But that's all I'm sorry for, you got that! Because I'm not holding anything else back!
Edgeworth:
(That last statement... It may sound like it makes sense... ...however, there is something I don't quite believe about it!) ...Are you sure you're not withholding further information from us?
Gumshoe:
Huh? O-O-O-O-Of course not! I've got nothing else to hide, pal!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Oh, if only that were true, Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
B-B-B-B-B-But it IS true, pal! I swear there's nothing else!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe, I'm sure you are aware of the price of a pack of Swiss rolls, correct?
Gumshoe:
Huh!? Umm... Remind me again, pal!?
Franziska:
That vending machine out in the hallway... ...is selling packs of two Swiss rolls for $6 a pack.
Gumshoe:
Mmmmnnnnrrrrgh...
Edgeworth:
And yet, according to you... ...you didn't have any cash on you until you cashed your $5 annual bonus check. Isn't that right?
Gumshoe:
Oooooooooonnngh...
Edgeworth:
Let me ask then, how did you managed to purchase a pack all by yourself? Can you provide me with a proper explanation to that?
Gumshoe:
Aaaaaaaargh! I told you, I bought it by myself, pal! There wasn't anyone else in that hallway with me... ...so there's no one who could've helped me buy it!
Edgeworth:
.........
Gumshoe:
Wait, don't tell me... You've got some kind of proof that there was someone else in the hallway, don't you!?
Edgeworth:
Correct.
Gumshoe:
As if you could! I mean, what are the chances of that... Wait, you do...?
Edgeworth:
Of course I do.
Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Hooooooooooow!?
Edgeworth:
(What proof do I have that there must have been someone else there in the hallway...?)
Present Swiss Roll
Edgeworth:

Leads to:
"Hey! You showed that to me not two seconds ago, pal!"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Gumshoe:
What the heck is that!? Heh, I knew you didn't really have anything! You prosecutors are all the same, always lying to people. You should stop, you know!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhhooooh! I refuse to be lectured by the likes of you, Detective!
Franziska:
Miles! How long do you plan on being strung along by this moronic detective!?
Edgeworth:
I have no intention of falling for his lie, because there was definitely a second person. (Because if he was truly alone all along, then that piece of evidence should not exist!)
Leads back to:
"(What proof do I have that there must have been someone else there in the hallway...?)"
Gumshoe:
Hey! You showed that to me not two seconds ago, pal!
Edgeworth:
Ah... I think you're under the mistaken impression that I bought this pack of rolls.
Gumshoe:
Wait, if you didn't buy it... then that means you must've stolen it! You thief!
Edgeworth:
Wh--!? I would never do such a thing!
Gumshoe:
All you liars are the same; you start out as thieves! You're under arrest, pal!!
Edgeworth:
I believe you meant to assert that all thieves start out as liars. And in that case, what does that say about you, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Gnnrk!
Edgeworth:
This particular Swiss roll was dropped by a certain someone.
Gumshoe:
.........Oh!
Edgeworth:
There were two rolls in this package. You ate one of them... ...but you then gave the other one to a certain other person, didn't you?
Gumshoe:
N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-No way, pal! You've got it all wrong! I ate both of them...
Edgeworth:
It would appear that we've caught you at last.
Gumshoe:
Hey! Don't you dare do anything bad to that girl!
Edgeworth:
(It would appear that they DO know each other after all...) So, why do you continue to come up to me and kick me? Have I wronged you somehow?
???:
I have a name, and it's Kay!
Edgeworth:
Kay what...?
Kay:
Kay Faraday!
Edgeworth:
Faraday... Are you perhaps, Mr. Faraday's daughter?
Kay:
I'm not a "you"! I'm "Kay"!
Edgeworth:
Mnnrgh... Kay. You know... good little girls don't kick other people. Especially not hard enough to leave big, nasty bruises like the way you do...
Kay:
Well, then you shouldn't have put Gummy under arrest, mister!
Edgeworth:
G-Gummy...?
Judge:
My guess is that she's talking about Detective Gumshoe.
Franziska:
...What a cute nickname you've given him.
Kay:
Gummy didn't do anything wrong!
Gumshoe:
Kay...
Edgeworth:
It appears that I will need to speak with her in a bit more detail...
Kay:
Rwaaaar!
Partner
Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Notice anything?
Franziska:
That girl... She seems to know that scruffy detective. Maybe she knows something about him that we don't.
Edgeworth:
Agreed. However, she seems to be rather... uncooperative at the moment.
Franziska:
She's like a stray alley cat. Ha ha ha. I wonder what would happen if we feed her.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... Perhaps I will try feeding her...)

Edgeworth:
And? Do you have nothing else to say?
Gumshoe:
Sure do! It was so fluffy! And sweet! And big! Ah, it was perfection, pal! And totally worth every penny of my bonus!
Edgeworth:
............I see. Well, good for you, Detective.
Franziska:
I can't believe it, but it's almost funny when a fool is this unbelievably foolish.
Judge
Judge:
Oh dear... *sigh*...
Edgeworth:
What is the matter, Your Honor?
Judge:
I claim to hand down fair verdicts, but I unfairly cast suspicion on the big fella. If this had been a trial just now, I would've destroyed his life! I... am the guilty one! *siiiiigh*...
Edgeworth:
...We all make mistakes, Your Honor. "To err is human, to forgive divine," as they say.
Franziska:
Although, if you were to make a mistake during a trial, then it would be quite unforgivable.
Edgeworth:
Now then, Kay...

It really belongs to you, though, doesn't it?
Kay:
...Yeah. I was saving it for Daddy.

Oh, my...
Edgeworth:
.........Your father... He's...
Gumshoe:
Ah! Don't you say another word, pal! She doesn't know yet!
Kay:
Thanks for watching out for me, Gummy... But... I... I already know about Daddy. I overheard the guards talking... ...about how Daddy's... he's... not here anymore...
Gumshoe:
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I couldn't protect him...
Edgeworth:
Kay...
Kay:
I-I'm not gonna cry! I'm not... gonna... ...cryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
Edgeworth:
It's alright... Let it all out... Your father just passed away, after all...
Edgeworth:
I, myself, was also involved in a case at this courthouse when I was a young child... A case in which my father, who was a defense attorney, passed away. All of my dreams of becoming a lawyer were crushed into fine ash on that nightmarish day. Even now, the wound festers deep in the depths of my soul. Even since that incident... I've dedicated myself to locking away every criminal I can. And now, to have this happen right in front of me...
Edgeworth:
(This child... I feel a certain shared fate, a common bond between us.)
Franziska:
...Miles Edgeworth! What sort of gentleman are you!? Are you going to just stand there and watch a lady cry?
Edgeworth:
Ah, you're right. Sorry about that. Kay... Here, How about we use this handkerchief and dry your little eyes?
Kay:
*quiver*... ...Uuuugggh... *Hooooonk!*
Edgeworth:
Nnnnghooooooh! My cravat! Don't blow your nose on that!
Kay:
...I feel better now. Thanks.

Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Notice anything?
Franziska:
It looks like the girl has finally calmed down.
Edgeworth:
Yes, I believe I can take my time and talk with her now.
Franziska:
It's so disrespectful for a child like that to be running around inside the courthouse! Does no one have respect for this country's judicial system anymore!?
Edgeworth:
(Didn't Mr. von Karma say the exact same thing earlier...?) But Franziska, I don't think you two are that far apart in terms of age...
Franziska:
I'm about to become a prosecutor, so understand that I'm nothing like that little girl!
Present
Promise Notebook
Franziska:
It looks like some sort of exchange diary that girl shared with her father. We're alike, that girl and I. Because they're both admirable prosecutors... ...we look up to our fathers. The only difference is that her father is now dead. If my father, who is the anchor of my life, were to die, I don't know what I'd do...
Edgeworth:
You needn't worry about that. Even if he were to be killed, Mr. von Karma's spirit would still go on living. Urrrnghk!
Franziska:
Don't talk about Papa like he's some sort of ghost!
Edgeworth:
(That was supposed to be a compliment...)
Kay Faraday
Edgeworth:
Kay, are you going to be... alright?
Kay:
Yup, I'm already alright!
Edgeworth:
(Somehow, I highly doubt that, but I'm not going to push it...)
Kay:
I promised Daddy I'd never cry in front of strangers.
Gumshoe:
And you're a good kid, aren't you, Kay!? You always keep your promises, right?
Kay:
Eheheh! That's right! Even if I can't see Daddy anymore, I'm still going to keep all my promises!
Edgeworth:
You're a very brave girl, Kay.
Franziska:
You're a very good child for keeping the promises you made to your papa. I'll even testify that you didn't cry, just for you.
Kay:
Thank you very much, lady!
Franziska:
......Hah. It's nothing. I'm only teling the truth, after all.
Edgeworth:
(It would appear that because her father was a respected prosecutor... ...Franziska is sympathetic to Kay's feelings...)
Your father
Edgeworth:
Kay, what kind of person was your father?
Kay:
Daddy was a Hero of Justice! His job was to catch all the bad people in the world!
Edgeworth:
So, to you, a prosecutor is a Hero of Justice, huh? I suppose we are in a sense, as we are the ones who seek guilty verdicts for criminals.
Kay:
Plus, you know what? Whenever I came to the courthouse... ...Daddy would buy me my absolute favorite treat, Swiss rolls!
Edgeworth:
Oh...?
Kay:
I wanna be a Hero of Justice someday, just like Daddy... ...so I've been working really hard!
Edgeworth:
I see. And what have you been working hard on?
Kay:
I've been working hard to keep all the promises Daddy and I made together!
Edgeworth:
A promise notebook...? May I take a look inside, Kay?
Kay:
Sure, OK!
Edgeworth:
(It appears to be an exchange diary of sorts between father and daughter. Mr. Faraday's writing conveys a sense of the kind of man he was. This little notebook just might come in handy later...)
Promise Notebook data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Thank you for showing it to me, Kay. I hope you'll continue to work hard and become a hero just like your father.
Kay:
I'm gonna try!
Gumshoe:
Hey, Kay! So, I'm a detective that catches the bad people, right? That makes me a hero, too!
Kay:
Yeah! You're really cool, too, Gummy!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, aren't I, Kay!?
Edgeworth:
(What is with the two of them...?)
Judge:
I-I hand down Verdicts of Justice, so that makes me a hero, too!
Franziska:
Yes, and thanks to your oh-so-heroic testimony... ...you almost painted that detective as a vile criminal and sent him off to jail.
Judge:
! I-I'm really sorry about that...
Kay:
Gummy is not a bad man, OK!?
Edgeworth:
(That poor Judge. He's being treated like a vile criminal rather than a Hero of Justice.) It appears that you and Detective Gumshoe are good friends, Kay.
Kay:
Yeah! We're friends!
Edgeworth:
In that case, would you mind telling me a little more about him?
Dick Gumshoe (appears after Your father)
Edgeworth:
So I take it that you ran into Detective Gumshoe earlier?
Kay:
Yup! I was on my way to see Daddy when I saw Gummy standing there. He was standing in the hallway staring really hard at the vending machine, so I said hi.
Edgeworth:
And when was this?
Kay:
Huh? Oh... Umm... Before everything got crazy.
Edgeworth:
How long were the two of you together?
Kay:
U-Umm... We only talked for a little while. And then we went on our own ways.
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! Kay and I only talked for a little while, and that's it!
Edgeworth:
Oh...? Which means... ...we have now confirmed that Kay was in the hallway during the recess, isn't that right?
Gumshoe:
.........Ack! You got meeeeeee!
Kay:
I told you to stop picking on Gummy, mister!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Very well, then. I'll just have to speak with the good detective in private later.
Swiss rolls
Edgeworth:
Were you the one who bought this pack of Swiss rolls, Kay?
Kay:
Umm... Well... I didn't really have a lot of money... ...and I somehow made a dollar out of all the pennies and quarters I had... But that still wasn't enough, and I really, really wanted one...
Edgeworth:
(Come to think of it... ...she did come and ask me to exchange a handful of change for a dollar...) And that's when you came and asked me to change your money, correct?
Kay:
Yeah! Thanks a bunch for doing that, mister!
Edgeworth:
Sure... But let me ask you, even with that dollar, you still didn't have enough, correct?
Kay:
Umm... Well... that's why...
Gumshoe:
Hey! If you bully Kay any more, I'm gonna have to arrest you, pal!
Franziska:
Need I remind you that you're the one already under arrest!?
Gumshoe:
Yeeeeow!
Edgeworth:
(I sense that Kay is going to be less than forthcoming with this question...)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Kay:
Oh! Daddy showed this to me before!
Edgeworth:
Well, he was a prosecutor, too, so it's only natural that he had one as well.
Kay:
Daddy would pin this badge on me a lot, just for fun.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Pinning a Prosecutor's Badge on a child for fun...
Kay:
Daddy said that if he put it on his clothes, a scary prosecutor would get mad. He also said that the scary prosecutor said it was more "fashionable" to not wear it.
Franziska:
I wonder who that scary prosecutor could be?
Edgeworth:
(I wonder... Could Kay be talking about Mr. von Karma...?)
Det. Gumshoe's Testimony
Kay:
You really need to stop picking on Gummy, OK!?
Edgeworth:

Knife, Handgun, Crime Scene Notes or Plastic Bag
Gumshoe:
What the heck are you doing, reminding her of her father's death, pal!?
Edgeworth:
I... didn't think of that.
Gumshoe:
She may look all happy, but she's really hurting deep down inside, you know! So have a heart and be more sensitive, OK, pal!?
Edgeworth:
Nngh... I-I'm sorry... (For once, this detective is actually the voice of reason...)

Kay:
It's the Promise Notebook Daddy and I made! I have to be a good girl and keep all of the promises we wrote in here!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... May I take a look inside for just a second?
Kay:
Sure, OK!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... It appears that there are more than just the five I thought there were... Promise VI... "If you ever have a boyfriend, you must bring him to meet Daddy right away." Promise VII... "Even when you have a boyfriend, never forget that I love you the most.") ..................

Huh? Are you giving it to me? Umm, but... ...I promised Daddy that I wouldn't take things from strangers. I'm sorry.
Edgeworth:
It's alright. I wasn't intending to give it to you anyway.
Kay:
Oh, OK. Eheheh, guess I thought wrong.
Franziska:
Miles, even if you show that to her, she isn't going to magically know all about it.
Edgeworth:
...I suppose you're right.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Kay:
Umm... Sorry... about your ruffly thing.
Edgeworth:
...*sigh* (Yes, well, now that it's positively drenched in your nasal mucus...) Don't worry, Kay. I have a spare. So here, you can have this one.
Kay:
...Ummmmm... But Daddy said... "Never take things from a stranger."
Edgeworth:
Ah, it's one of the promises you made in your Promise Notebook, correct?
Kay:
Yeah! Look, see! It's right here on this page!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Alright then, I'm not giving this to you. I'm merely allowing you to borrowing it. You can take it home, wash it nice and clean, and then give it back to me next time we meet.
Kay:
...OK! Daddy never said I couldn't borrow things from strangers!
Edgeworth:
Now then, Detective Gumshoe...
Gumshoe:
Uh oh...
Edgeworth:
I believe it is now crystal clear... ...that you were with little Kay in that hallway!
Gumshoe:
Ooooonnngh...
Kay:
Grr! I told you to stop being mean to Gummy!!!
Hold it!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! There is still something you have yet to resolve.
Edgeworth:
I beg your pardon?
Franziska:
You still haven't offered an explanation for why that man would lie to us.
Edgeworth:
Th-That's...! Well...
Kay:
! Gummy... Don't tell me you lied for my sake...?
Gumshoe:
Hey! don't worry about it, Kay! Everything's gonna be OK!
Edgeworth:
(Ah, so that's why...)
Franziska:
So, what was Detective Gumshoe's motive for lying? If you can't explain that, then you can't call this a perfect investigation!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. His reason for lying is very simple.
Franziska:
Wh-What!?
Edgeworth:
Here is what I believe to be his reason: From simple observation of the Detective's actions and his interactions with Kay... ...it's obvious the Detective was lying for the young girl's sake. And this piece of evidence will show you exactly why. (Which piece of evidence proves that Detective Gumshoe was lying on account of Kay?)
Present Promise Notebook
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Mr. Faraday and Kay's Promise Notebook? How does this explain anything?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is that piece of evidence!
Franziska:
What are you showing me that for? It doesn't seem to add anything to the conversation.
Gumshoe:
Umm, I don't get what you're trying to say with that. Or do you just like showing it off?
Kay:
Are you gonna give that to me, mister?
Judge:
Hmm... I don't feel that the court needs to enter that into the court record at this time.
Edgeworth:
Gnnnrk! (What is wrong with everyone!? Why are they ALL teasing me all of a sudden!? Although... it's possible that perhaps I made a mistake, and that's why... Now then, back to the topic at hand. Detective Gumshoe lied for Kay's sake. And I know I hold the evidence which shows the reason why!)
Leads back to:
"(Which piece of evidence proves that Detective Gumshoe was lying on account of Kay?)"
Franziska:
Mr. Faraday and Kay's Promise Notebook? How does this explain anything?
Edgeworth:
If you could take a look at this page, it's clearly written that Kay should... "Never take things from a stranger." When Detective Gumshoe heard about that promise, he tried to cover for Kay.
Franziska:
......... What a foolishly foolish fool's fool of a foolish reason for a fool!
Gumshoe:
Eeeowwwwww!
Kay:
Gummy... You lied because of me, didn't you?
Gumshoe:
Because I'm your friend, Kay! That's why!
Kay:
Gummy...!
Edgeworth:
...At long last. Detective Gumshoe, can you please tell me the whole truth now?
Gumshoe:
Guess there's no beating you, huh, pal? OK, OK, I'll spill the goods! I'd been standing guard for a while... I was getting really hungry, and that snack vending machine was taunting me.
Franziska:
But all the cash you had on you was $5, and that wasn't enough to buy anything, right? After all, the cheapest item in that machine is a $6 pack of Swiss rolls.
Gumshoe:
Yeah... But then, like an angel from heaven, Kay showed up...
Kay:
I was thinking about sharing a snack with Daddy... ...so I wanted to buy a Swiss roll. But I only had about a dollar in coins.
Gumshoe:
So we pooled my $5 and her $1 together... ...and bought a pack of Swiss rolls together.
Kay:
But I was worried... ...about breaking one of my promises. So then Gummy said...
Gumshoe:
Mr. Faraday's one scary guy when he gets mad! But, don't worry. You won't get in trouble if I don't tell, right!? Besides, you bought it with me! So you didn't really get it from me, you know?
Kay:
...He told me it'd be OK... And he gave me a whole roll to save and give to Daddy.
Franziska:
...Who knew that Scruffy could be so considerate...?
Edgeworth:
Indeed... Detective, I take it that you then sat down on the bench and ate the rolls together?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, we split the other roll and ate it right then! The sweet taste of that cake's chocolate... I'll never forget it as long as I live, pal!
Edgeworth:
Anyway... Kay, I believe this also belongs to you.
Kay:
Oh! That's from the balloon I popped...
Franziska:
It's bad manners to leave garbage lying around, Kay.
Kay:
I'm sorry...
Franziska:
Well, I guess I can't blame you for not throwing this one piece away. It was sitting high up on a windowsill where you couldn't see it. So just this once, I forgive you.
Kay:
But that balloon... I wanted to surprise Gummy a little, so I popped it on purpose... ...and because of me, Gummy dropped his half of the Swiss roll.
Gumshoe:
Aha ha ha! Wow, you really got me there, pal!
Kay:
So I thought maybe I should give Gummy this other roll. And then, I saw you picking on Gummy, mister...
Edgeworth:
So you kicked me, is that it?
Franziska:
You sure are a feisty one.
Kay:
I'm really sorry, mister...
Edgeworth:
It's alright. I'm perfectly unharmed. But about this Swiss roll... Would it be alright with you... ...If I held onto it until Detective Gumshoe is cleared of all charges and free to go?
Kay:
Yeah! Sure! Just make sure you give it to Gummy afterwards, OK!?
Edgeworth:
Of course. I promise. Now then, I believe we have proven beyond the shadow of a doubt... ...that Detective Gumshoe was in the hallway for the entire duration of his duty. Which undeniably proves... ...that Detective Gumshoe could not have committed the double murders.
Yew:
Objection!
Yew:
Actually, it proves just the opposite, Edgeworth. You've just shown... ...that Detective Gumshoe is the only one who could have committed the crime.
Edgeworth:
Wh-What do you mean!?
Franziska:
It's quite rude to eavesdrop, Ms. Yew.
Yew:
Phwwh... Ahah... Ahahahahaha! Mnnphwwwwh... I'm getting lectured on manners... ...by a girl with a penchant for whipping people! Phwwwwkkkgh!
Franziska:
Wh-What!? How dare you talk back with such insolence!?
Kay:
You're wrong, lady! Gummy's not the bad guy!
Yew:
Oh, and what have we here? What is a child doing here in a courthouse? Bailiff! Please take this child in!
Kay:
!
Edgeworth:
Wh--!? Ms. Calisto Yew! That girl is Mr. Faraday's...!
Yew:
I know. So what? You think that just because she's the victim's daughter... ...she gets to just run wild all around the crime scene? I think it's actually quite dangerous for her, to speak nothing of getting underfoot.
Edgeworth:
I suppose you're right, however...
Yew:
As long as we're in agreement on that point, let's get back to the real issue at hand. Now then, Detective, you were in front of the door to Lobby No. 2 the entire time, correct?
Gumshoe:
Y-Yeah, but...
Yew:
You see! Isn't it obvious that it could only be the detective? He is the only person who could've gone into Lobby No. 2 at the time of the murders!
Edgeworth:
Arngh! (I... have no counterargument to that...!)
Yew:
Don't worry, I've already put in the necessary paperwork for his formal arrest.
Edgeworth:
Nnrgh! But the investigation is far from over!
Yew:
Oh, that's right. I was going to speak with you about that. Don't you think it's reckless to talk to the suspect out in the open without a guard?
Edgeworth:
Nngh... I suppose it is...
Yew:
Well, as someone with more experience in law than you, allow me to share something: Always keep a good eye on a criminal, or you may regret what comes of your negligence.
Franziska:
Oooooh...! Miles, I can't believe you're letting this woman lecture you like this! This is unforgivable as a disciple of Von Karma!
Yew:
Ha ha ha. Down, tigress. Now then, I'll be looking forward to the results of your investigation.
Franziska:
So. We're back to square one.
Edgeworth:
Actually, this is our last chance. I can tell that if we fail to solve this case... ...Detective Gumshoe will be formally charged under all of the circumstantial evidence. (This investigation is not over yet. There's still one location we have yet to inspect. It's where Detective Badd and Ms. Yew were at the time of the crime -- Lobby No. 1!)
To be continued.
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right...)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Franziska von Karma)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence that proves the flaw in your theory!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! You dare try to bluff through this by presenting unrelated evidence? You're a disgrace to the Von Karma name!
Edgeworth:
Nngh! (Could I have it all wrong...?)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Franziska von Karma)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Franziska, I advise you take a look at this piece of evidence.
Franziska:
And what are you trying to say with this?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I'm saying that this piece of evidence...
Franziska:
...Doesn't contradict with my testimony.
Edgeworth:
Arrghnn...!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth... Just face it; I'm going to win our little competition.
Edgeworth:
(Nngh! I have to calm down and do a better job of finding a flaw in her logic!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Franziska von Karma)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There is a clear contradiction in your line of logic!
Franziska:
And where, pray tell, would that contradiction be?
Edgeworth:
Maybe... nowhere?
Franziska:
Exactly.
Edgeworth:
Nngh! (Could I have it all wrong...? At this rate, I'll lose the truth for all eternity... I need to pay more attention to her testimony...!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Calisto Yew)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew, what do you think about this?
Yew:
Well, as someone with more experience in law than you, allow me to share something: Use your own brain and figure it out yourself. That's my advice to you.
Edgeworth:
I see. Well, I'm terribly sorry to have bothered you with such a mundane question.
Yew:
Phwwwwh! No need to be so serious! Tell you what, I'll toss in another piece of evidence. In no way does my testimony contradict with that piece of evidence.
Edgeworth:
Nngh......... (I should've known...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Calisto Yew)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I believe this piece of evidence contradicts your statement just now.
Yew:
..................
Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew! I insist that you please take a good look at this!
Yew:
I don't need to do anything. I can already tell you it doesn't contradict a thing I said.
Edgeworth:
Nngh... I... I see...! (She's fearsome when she's not doubled over in laughter! I must treac carefully here!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Calisto Yew)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There is a glaring flaw in your testimony, and this piece of evidence will prove it!
Yew:
Phwwh...! Mnphwwwh! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Edgeworth:
! What exactly is so funny!?
Yew:
Phwwh! You say you're a disciple of Von Karma...? Phwwwwwwh! I can't wait to see what kind of prodigy you really turn out to be in court! Phwwh! Because, right now, you're a prodigy among mistaken buffons, that's for sure! Ahah!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! You will take your punishment for soiling the good name of Von Karma!
Edgeworth:
Nnghaah! (Your simultaneous reprimands are punishment enough!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Judge)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! There is a very large flaw in your statement just now!
Judge:
Hmm? I don't understand what you're talking about. Where is it, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
N-Nevermind, Your Honor.
Judge:
Making such accusatory statements... I don't know how I feel about that.
Edgeworth:
I-I'm truly sorry, Your Honor! (Arghn! I have to find a flaw in his testimony before the truth escapes me completely!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Judge)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That statement and this piece of evidence... contradict one another!
Judge:
I don't feel a contradiction in the air.
Edgeworth:
Arghn!
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... I advise you to be a little more cautious with what you say.
Edgeworth:
Mmmrrrgh... (It would appear that I was mistaken.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Judge)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That statement right now contradicts with this piece of evidence!
Judge:
Really!?
Franziska
Your Honor, by my account... there is absolutely no contradiction here at all.
Judge:
R-R-R-REALLY!? Well then, I guess we're still alright. Please continue with the testimony.
Edgeworth:
The two of them overruled me!? (At this rate, I will lose the truth to the darkness forever... I need to stay calm, think carefully, and find a flaw in his testimony, fast!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Dick Gumshoe)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There is clearly a contradiction here!
Gumshoe:
There is?
Edgeworth:
Do you not recognize that there is one?
Gumshoe:
Not at all, pal.
Edgeworth:
I see. In that case, I retract what I said...
Franziska:
Why can't you ever just admit when you're wrong!?
Edgeworth:
Gnnrrrk! (Curses... I can't keep on doing this. I must regain my composure, and think it through again!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Dick Gumshoe)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. There is a problem with that statement you just made!
Gumshoe:
What are you talking about!? There's nothing wrong with my statement, pal! So don't go around slamming what I have to say for no good reason, alright!? Unless you do have a good reason! In which case, can you explain it to me in a way that even I can understand, pal!?
Edgeworth:
Mmnnrrgh...
Franziska:
Hmph. Miles... It looks like that evidence will be of little use to you in breaking Scruffy's lie.
Edgeworth:
Yes, I can see that! (I guess I was wrong... I need to pay attention and listen carefully to his testimony one more time...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Dick Gumshoe)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence proves the contradiction in your statement!
Gumshoe:
Huh? What exactly does it prove?
Edgeworth:
Um, I suppose it doesn't "prove" so much as...
Judge:
Looks like a meaningless piece of evidence. The court refuses to accept it into the record.
Edgeworth:
Mmrrrrnngh... (It would appear that I was mistaken... Arghn! If I continue to make mistakes like this, the truth will slip from my grasp!)
Too many penalties (during investigation of Courtroom Lobby No. 2)
Manfred:
What are you hesitating for!? I should have known you weren't ready yet.
Edgeworth:
Sir! Please, wait!
Manfred:
This matter should not have taken more than three minutes to resolve! Period! Franziska, you disappoint me as well. Now get out of my sight, the both of you!
Franziska:
Papa! Wait!
Edgeworth:
(Nngh! Is this the best I could do...?)
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (during argument of Franziska, in Courtroom Lobby No. 2)
Franziska:
It would appear... that I am the victor.
Edgeworth:
W-Wait a second, Franziska!
Franziska:
I don't need to hear any more from you! As I've always thought, only I am worthy of the Von Karma name!
Edgeworth:
(Nngh! Was that really the best I could do...!?)
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (during argument of Yew, in Courtroom Lobby No. 2)
Yew:
Ahahahaha! Is there anything else you'd like to share?
Franziska:
Miles! Why aren't you fighting back!?
Edgeworth:
Nngh... Because I have nothing to fight back with at this point in time.
Gumshoe:
Wh-What!? But I didn't do it, sir! Please, help me!
Yew:
And that's the way it is, Mr. Badd.
Badd:
.........Gumshoe. Just come along quietly, alright?
Gumshoe:
But sir...!
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (during investigation of Hallway)
Badd:
...Afraid I can't let the two of you mess things up any more than you already have. So don't get me wrong. but... get out.
Edgeworth:
Wh--!? But I have an investigation to run!
Badd:
Hmph... I don't care if you do or don't... The fact is... that you're in my way. You there! Take these kids outside.
Forensics:
Sir! Yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (during argument of Judge, in Courtroom No. 3)
Judge:
I'm sorry, but I have to prepare for my next court hearing. Don't worry, I'll make the necessary arrangements for Detective Gumshoe's arrest...
Edgeworth:
Please wait, Your Honor! There is still much we have yet to resolve...
Judge:
Unfortunately for you, this court sees no reason to further prolong the issue. That is all. The court is abjourned!
Edgeworth:
(Nngh! THIS was the best I could do...!?)
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (during argument of Gumshoe, in Courtroom No. 3)
Yew:
Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha! That's as far as you go, Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
What is it now, Ms. Yew?
Yew:
I don't have any more time to waste babysitting the two of you. I think we have enough to take Detective Gumshoe in as a "material witness". Don't we, Mr. Badd?
Edgeworth:
What!? Since when!?
Gumshoe:
N-No way, pal! I swear I didn't do anything!
Badd:
.........We can talk more down at the station.
Gumshoe:
Detective Badd! Please, you've gotta believe me, sir! I'm innocent, sir! Honest...!
Edgeworth:
(Nngh! Is this all I could do for him...!?)
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Nothing to Examine
Edgeworth:
There's nothing unusual about this area.
