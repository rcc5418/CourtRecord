Maya:
Hey...it's Patty's shop! Maaaaan, this place really brings back some memories!
Luke:
Mmmm... I recognise this yummy smell!
Espella:
I want to surprise Aunt Patty today, so I've kept our visit a secret.
Layton:
Ah, Mrs Eclaire's bakery... It has been a while. I hope she's as jovial as ever.
Constantine:
Woof! Woof!
Phoenix:
Hey, look! It's Constantine. I wonder what he's doing here.
Constantine:
Grrrrr...
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Check out those pearly whites. He looks really happy to see you!
Phoenix:
Happy to see me? More like happy to have his favourite blue chew toy...
Eve:
Meow...
Luke:
Oh, look! Eve's here too. And looking as cute as ever!
Maya:
I wonder if Constantine and Eve are friends now... Hey, Luke. Why don't you ask and find out?
Luke:
Umm...okay. But you do realise these things are pretty personal questions, Maya. Even for a dog... So, Constantine... Are you and Eve on friendly terms now?
Constantine:
Woof! Ruff...woof!
Luke:
He said: "Friendship has no place on the battlefield! 'Tis nothing more than a fool's errand for a dog of knightly honour!"
Maya:
Affectionate as ever, Constantine! Not sure I'd call this place a "battlefield", exactly...
Phoenix:
Did anyone else notice that Eve is chewing on an éclair?
Espella:
Oh, Eve... You can't go eating Aunt Patty's pastries like that!
Eve:
...Meow.
Luke:
Just a moment, Espella! Eve said that the éclair was a present from Constantine!
Maya:
Wow! Really...? Luke, do that "animal whisper" thing again, and dig up some more dirt!
Luke:
Uhh... Okay, Maya. You've really taken quite an interest in their personal lives, haven't you? Is it true, Constantine? Did you give Eve that éclair as a present?
Constantine:
Woof, ruff!
Luke:
Constantine said that he doesn't recall having given anyone a present.
Maya:
Hear that, Nick? Constantine gave Eve a present. You could learn a thing or two from him...
Phoenix:
Huh...? What could I possibly learn from a dog?!
Constantine:
Grrrrr...rrrrr... Ruff ruff ruff...woof!
Phoenix:
AAAAAAARGH! AAAAAAHH! Why me?! Why does he always bite me...?!
Layton:
Perhaps he's merely expressing a fondness for you... Now then, shall we all go on in and see Mrs Eclaire?
Bakery
Luke:
Wow...the smell of freshly baked bread!
Layton:
This must be the work of a true artisan, Luke.
???:
Barnham:
Buy it. Take it. Eat it.
Layton:
Hmm... It would appear we have found a baker quite proficient in the use of cutting-edge methods, Luke.
Luke:
...He has such a fearsome expression as he's kneading that dough.
Layton:
Rather than "kneading" the dough, I'd say he's "punishing it into submission", Luke.
Phoenix:
I can almost hear the agonising screams of that poor, defenceless dough...
Maya:
Yeah. I bet the poor lump is wishing it had never been made...
Espella:
Um... Excuse me...Mr Barnham. ...The guests have arrived.
Barnham:
Hm...? Well, well, well... If it isn't Sir Blue Knight, the daunting defender of justice! ...And the intrepid Sir Top Hat, no less! I welcome you back to Labyrinthia, and insist that you enjoy your stay.
Phoenix:
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't "insist" while drawing your sword and waving it in our faces...
Barnham:
Ah, the witch trials... They seem like but a dream from long ago... 'Tis hard to believe they truly happened.
Layton:
Indeed, it is. Especially given how peaceful the town now seems.
Luke:
But then... Why are you still wearing your armour, Mr Barnham?
Barnham:
According to the mistress of the bakery, a baker's apron is his armour. Thus, I choose to wear my armour as my apron, while doing battle with the dough both fairly and squarely.
Maya:
I've gotta admit, I'd expect nothing less from "Ex-Inquisitor" Barnham. He's baking Barnham-style, I guess.
Phoenix:
You're not wrong, Maya... But I've gotta say...I never pictured you becoming a baker, Barnham.
Espella:
Well, actually, Mr Barnham is only a part-time baker.
Maya:
Just a little side job, huh?
Espella:
He's kindly agreed to stay here for a while and help out in the shop.
Barnham:
I, err...have recently found myself in need of some extra coin. What little I make here helps out a bit. And living here also means that Constantine gets to eat all the fresh éclair he desires.
Phoenix:
(So that "present" to Eve was a leftover...)
Maya:
Anyway, how come you need money so bad? Are you paying back a loan on that armour or something?
Layton:
As fearlessly direct as ever, Miss Fey.
Barnham:
Well, in truth...I am planning to use the extra money to buy something special. You could say...a gift, of sorts...
Maya:
What?! Did you say "gift"? So, who's the lucky lady, Barnham?
Phoenix:
...L-lucky lady? Assuming it IS for a girl, I wouldn't get your hopes up, Maya...
Barnham:
........................ I-I have just noticed the dough for the bread rolls is now prime and ready for the flames! I-if you will excuse me...
Maya:
Hey! Barnham...
Barnham:
Soft doughy rolls, delight of Labyrinthia! May the fire's embrace bake you!
Luke:
Professor! There goes that agonising scream from the dough again...and it's intensified!
Layton:
Well, my boy, I'm sure it's all part and parcel of the roll-making process.
Maya:
But I wonder... is Patty even paying him for any of this?
Phoenix:
Well...since he's staying at the bakery too, I guess he's like a live-in apprentice.
Luke:
An...apprentice? Is that normal for a bakery?
Layton:
Hmm... Well, the apprenticeship system has been around since the Middle Ages...albeit not generally in the field of bread-making.
Maya:
Anyway, worst-case scenario, I guess she'll at least be paying him in bread, right?
Phoenix:
I suppose bread would be better than nothing...
???:
Hold it right there... Did my ears deceive me...or did you just say "worst-case scenario"...?
Phoenix:
Th-that voice... I know that voice...
???:
And what's more... ...I could have sworn I just heard the words "better than nothing".
Maya:
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-boss!
Phoenix:
YIKES! I mean...h-hey there, Patty!
Patty:
Now, I'm sure you both know what happens in MY bakery... when you belittle the importance of bread, do you not?
Maya:
No... Not the rolling pin! Quick, Barnham! Help us! H-he's gone!
Patty:
Right, you two... Prepare yourselves... Because there's no backing away now... from this delightfully challenging puzzle that has absolutely nothing to do with bread!

Patty:
Really, Espella... You should have let me know in advance that you were planning to invite everyone here! If I'd known, I could have prepared a big batch of my best hot buns!
Espella:
I'm sorry, Aunt Patty... I wanted to surprise you.
Patty:
Phoenix, Maya, how have you both been? I bet you're really rolling in the dough these days, aren't you?
Phoenix:
Yeah, we can't complain, I mean, we make enough to get by. Unless...I wonder if we're talking about the same thing here...
Maya:
I, uhh...don't think it matters either way, Nick.
Luke:
Phew...looks like that puzzle helped calm Mrs Eclaire down a bit.
Layton:
Indeed, Luke. I'm delighted to see that friendly smile once again.
Espella:
Oh! I almost forgot...
Phoenix:
What's up, Espella?
Espella:
I need to prepare a present too...
Luke:
Really? You too, Espella?
Maya:
So...who's your present for, Espella?
Espella:
It's for Eve... Her birthday's coming up soon.
Maya:
Wow, no kidding? ...Eve's birthday, huh... ...Wait! Didn't Barnham say something about a super-special gift?
Phoenix:
You don't mean...he's been baking a present for Eve's birthday?
Luke:
Now that's a surprise! Do you think maybe Mr Barnham has a soft spot for Miss Eve?
Layton:
I must confess, this is rather intriguing.
Maya:
Aww! That's so romantic! Wouldn't you say, Nick?
Phoenix:
Uh, y-yeah... I guess so.
Barnham:
Barnham:
I will say this but one time... Romance has no place on the battlefield. 'Tis nothing more than a fool's errand for a baker of knightly honour!
Phoenix:
