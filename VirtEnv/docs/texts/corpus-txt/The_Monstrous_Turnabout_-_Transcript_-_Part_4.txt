Day 2Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise
Judge:
Court is back in session for the trial of Damian Tenma.
Apollo:
Apollo Justice, defense team leader, is ready, Your Honor!
Athena:
Athena Cykes, assistant defender, is ready, too, Your Honor. Je suis prÃªt!
Judge:
As chipper as ever, I see. And in French, no less! ...And the prosecution?
Blackquill:
.........
Judge:
Very well, then. By the way, I asked Detective Fulbright to provide sturdier shackles today. There will be no more of your funny business this time, Prosecutor Blackquill!
Blackquill:
...Hmph.
Judge:
Now, your opening statement, if you would. I believe it's standard procedure for the prosecution to handle it.
Athena:
Looks like the judge is really bringing it today.
Apollo:
He probably realized how Blackquill played him. That was one mean game of Simon Says.
Athena:
Yeah, His Honor has to fight to defend his honor today.
Blackquill:
.........Your Baldness... It's plain to see that you've always dreamed of delivering an epic opening statement.
Judge:
I have? Hmm... I don't know if I'd say that.
Blackquill:
Why, of course you have. I saw it in your eyes the last time you gave the opening statement. That was the look of one who yearns deeply for the thrill of an epic opening statement. For decades now, you have been watching opening statements from your bench. They were the crown jewels of the court -- the one thing you could not possess!
Judge:
The crown jewels... of the court?
Blackquill:
Now, at long last, they are within your grasp. How could you possibly refuse?
Judge:
......Oh, uh, so you don't mind if I do it, then?
Blackquill:
I'll make a special exception, just this once.
Athena:
Here we go again.
Apollo:
Yep, more of Blackquill's mind games.
Judge:
Well, in that case, I think I might go ahead and make the opening statement myself. *ahem* In yesterday's session, we learned the shocking truth that... ...the victim Alderman Rex Kyubi was The Amazing Nine-Tails. We also learned that... ...The Amazing Nine-Tails was a key figure in the yokai craze and anti-merger protests. It was further revealed that upon learning Rex Kyubi's secret identity... ...Mayor Damian Tenma murdered him. The fact that the crime took place in a tightly locked room was also brought to light. And the only people in that tightly locked room were the defendant and victim. The defense proposed the existence of a hypothetical third party... ...but further investigation revealed no proof of a third party who had escaped the room.
Blackquill:
...Ergo?
Judge:
We must conclude that the evidence against the defendant is... well... conclusive. Eek! D-Did I say something wrong?
Blackquill:
...That was quite astonishing. You've truly outdone yourself this time.
Judge:
Oh, heh heh. One more thing to boast about to my grandchild!
Apollo:
(Well, this was not an unexpected turn of events...)
Judge:
Now then, it seems the prosecution has called a new witness to testify.
Blackquill:
The inexplicable yokai evidence left at the scene of the crime... Well, does that not demand some sort of explanation?
Judge:
The feathers and tracks? Weren't those left by the mayor while he was possessed?
Blackquill:
That was but an act to protect his daughter.
Judge:
Oh! Uh... yes, of course! I had suspected as much.
Apollo:
(Wait, did he actually believe the mayor's "award-winning" performance?)
Blackquill:
His daughter was the one who planted the yokai evidence. Ergo, the true identity of the yokai in the manor was the manor's maid, Jinxie Tenma.
Apollo:
Apollo:
The prosecution is engaging in mere conjecture!
Blackquill:
Hmph. Would you care for some witness testimony, then? For I am ready to prove that the little scamp is the one behind the Tenma Taro farce.
Apollo:
(Witness testimony? I'll bet he means Filch and that creep L'Belle.)
Judge:
Very well, then. Bailiff, would you bring in the first witness?
Judge:
Mr. Filch, you made quite the hasty exit yesterday. See that it doesn't happen again today.
Filch:
Eh heh heh. Been known for my hasty retreats since I was a kid. Bit of a trademark o' mine.
Judge:
Indeed. You managed to give a total of five bailiffs the slip.
Filch:
Like those amateurs could ever nab me, eh heh heh. Yiiipes!
Blackquill:
Perhaps we should shackle you by the neck. That would keep you in place.
Filch:
Yipes! No, please, I'm liable to rip my own head off if I start running!
Blackquill:
.........Your statement. Now.
Filch:
Yes, sir, Mr. Blackhead, sir!
Athena:
He may beat a hasty retreat, but there's no escaping Prosecutor Blackquill.
Apollo:
Yeah, Blackquill doesn't strike me as the give-up-easy type.
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Filch, your testimony please. Specifically, the true nature of the yokai you saw in the manor shortly after the crime.
Witness Testimony
-- The Yokai Is Jinxie --
Filch:
Tenma Taro's really that little maid gal. Ain't no doubt about it!
I mean, the Tenma Taro I saw was just a lil' thing 'bout her size!
But the little runt had a big ol' staff. I seen it when she came into the foyer!
Betcha she stole it from the Forbidden Chamber after stumbling on the crime scene.
She was gonna use it to wallop me on account o' my fierce reputation, I just know it!
Judge:
So, Tenma Taro was short in stature. And that's because it was Ms. Jinxie Tenma all along?
Filch:
You betcha! Besides, all the rest in the manor were way taller than her.
Blackquill:
Feigning height is but an easy thing... ...but a big ox like the defendant could never pass for short.
Apollo:
What if the Tenma Taro impersonator was walking on their knees?
Filch:
Weren't no knee walking. I seen it myself!
Judge:
Hmm... Then perhaps that yokai really was Ms. Tenma, after all.
Blackquill:
All monsters are naught but tricks, either of the mind or the cheap parlor variety.
Judge:
So, you're saying she created an illusion like one of those magical eye things?
Blackquill:
Precisely. Human senses are easily deceived. Take the fellow in the cell next to me. Each night, he cries and screams about some ghost he thinks he sees. But in truth, it was simply the janitor.
Judge:
Ho ho ho. Prosecutor Blackquill just gave up the ghost, literally!
Blackquill:
The janitor's deathly complexion and all-white attire are, no doubt, partially to blame. That and the fact that he constantly mutters about taking vengeance for this or that.
Apollo:
(That...... actually sounds like a real ghost to me.)
Judge:
The defense may now cross-examine the witness.
Cross Examination
-- The Yokai Is Jinxie --
Filch:
Tenma Taro's really that little maid gal. Ain't no doubt about it!
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Mr. Filch, you and Mr. L'Belle mentioned something about a practice yesterday. Do you deny this so-called lesson was about what you were supposed to say in court?
Filch:
N-No, ya got it all wrong!
Apollo:
Then could you tell the court exactly what sort of lesson it was?
Filch:
Oh, um... it was... Uh... it was... What was it again? Yiiipes! Ah, now I remember! Math! Ya know, numbers 'n' stuff!
Apollo:
(He's completely under Blackquill's control, too...)
Filch:
Anyway, that Tenma Taro was that little maid gal, so what's the difference?
Filch:
I mean, the Tenma Taro I saw was just a lil' thing 'bout her size!
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
I take it you got a good look at how tall the Tenma Taro impersonator was?
Filch:
Eh heh heh, you betcha. I got a habit o' sizing people up. I can even give ya a primer on how to pull it off. All under the table, natch. I got a knack for figuring out where people's pockets are and how much money they have. I size 'em real good before I relieve them of their valuables!
Apollo:
(He just admitted to being a pickpocket right here in court.)
Judge:
Does the witness hold that this Tenma Taro entered the foyer?
Filch:
Darn right I do.
Filch:
But the little runt had a big ol' staff. I seen it when she came into the foyer!
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Well... you're not going to brush it all off by claiming the perp was short!
Filch:
Eh heh heh. Musta hit a raw nerve 'cause ya ain't that tall yerself!
Apollo:
(Look who's talking, Mr. I've-got-to-stand-on-a-box-just-to-testify!) Anyway, Mr. Filch, correct me if I'm wrong... ...but didn't you say the Tenma Taro you saw had a staff?
Filch:
Cross my heart, hope to die! I know 'cause it went a jingle and a jangle.
Apollo:
And where do you suppose that staff came from?
Filch:
Errr... The staff, ya say? Well, I uh...
Filch:
Betcha she stole it from the Forbidden Chamber after stumbling on the crime scene.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
I suppose you mean to say that Jinxie Tenma entered the Forbidden Chamber to get one.
Filch:
Well, I ain't never seen a staff like that in the manor! So it had to be the Forbidden Chamber!
Apollo:
(Oh, really? The stench of L'Belle is thick in the air today.)
Athena:
Jinxie entered the Forbidden Chamber after the incident... ...then she took the staff and tried to cover up her actions by pretending to be Tenma Taro. I guess that's what Filch is trying to say...?
Apollo:
(Could Jinxie have even entered the Forbidden Chamber if she wanted to...?)
Judge:
There IS one thing I was wondering about. Why did that yokai have a staff in the first place?
Filch:
Eh heh heh. Well, I've got my hunches about that.
Present Forbidden Chamber Key
Apollo:
Leads to:
"It would seem that Tenma Taro was, in fact, not this innocent little girl."
Filch:
She was gonna use it to wallop me on account o' my fierce reputation, I just know it!
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Wallop you? And why would the so-called yokai want to do that?
Filch:
That little maid gal never did like me! She always high tails it when I come 'round or she sticks these weird papers on my noggin!
Apollo:
(She probably thinks of him as the dreaded tanuki monster of Kyubi Manor or something.)
Athena:
We need to prove that Jinxie isn't Tenma Taro. But I've no idea how we're going to do that.
Apollo:
All we have to do is prove that it was impossible for Jinxie to turn into Tenma Taro. And that might be easier than you think.
Athena:
Really?
Apollo:
(Now's our chance. Our chance to expose the real Tenma Taro for all to see!)
Apollo:
It would seem that Tenma Taro was, in fact, not this innocent little girl.
Filch:
Huh? How you figure that?
Apollo:
You claim the Tenma Taro you saw had one of those staves from the Forbidden Chamber. But it would've been impossible for Ms. Tenma to get a hold of one!
Judge:
Care to elaborate, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
The mayor swallowed this key shortly after the murder. He wanted to keep the killer out of the Forbidden Chamber.
Blackquill:
...What's this?
Apollo:
This key was deep in the mayor's stomach when Ms. Tenma discovered the crime scene. So you see, it would've been impossible for her to get into the Forbidden Chamber. In short, the Tenma Taro seen holding that staff... ...could not have been Jinxie Tenma!
Blackquill:
...Ack!
Filch:
Aaaaaaargh!
Judge:
Wh-Whaaaaaat?! B-But...! Then who does the defense believe was impersonating Tenma Taro?!
Apollo:
Our Tenma Taro impersonator is none other than Mayor Tenma's aide--
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
Such accusations beg evidence. Aside from his ghastly appearance, can you prove he is the yokai we seek?
Apollo:
Yes, in fact, I can.
Judge:
Hmm... Very well, let's see where the defense is going with this. Mr. Justice, please show us proof as to the true identity of the Tenma Taro impersonator.
Present Hand Cream
Apollo:
Leads to:
"We found this hand cream in the Forbidden Chamber."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Blackquill:
Hmph. So, that is the evidence you have to offer? And how, pray tell, does that inform us of who it was that entered the Forbidden Chamber?
Apollo:
Oh, uh... good question.
Athena:
Way to walk down a one-way street to a dead end.
Judge:
The court doesn't need more questions, Mr. Justice. The defense will present evidence that provides answers, and only answers. A penalty for our questionable attorney!
Apollo:
(I know we have evidence that can prove who was in the Forbidden Chamber.) The killer was the only one who could've entered the Forbidden Chamber. The question before us is simply the "who" part of this equation.
Leads back to:
"Mr. Justice, please show us proof as to the true identity of the Tenma Taro impersonator."
Apollo:
We found this hand cream in the Forbidden Chamber. And we know that whoever was Tenma Taro took one of the staves out of there. In short... ....I believe whoever this hand cream belongs to is the yokai impersonator we're looking for.
Judge:
Hmm... But Mr. Justice... ...how do you propose to identity the hand cream's owner?
Apollo:
I'm glad you asked, Your Honor. The defense requests a fingerprint analysis on this piece of evidence! It might tell us who it belongs to!
Judge:
Interesting... So, you expect to find the yokai's prints there? Very well, I hereby call a short recess while we wait for the fingerprint results.
Blackquill:
No need for that, Your Baldness. We have the prints of everyone at the manor that day.
Fulbright:
You called, Prosecutor Blackquill?!
Apollo:
(.........Could anyone be more whipped?)
Blackquill:
Fool Bright! Analyze this for prints. You have three minutes.
Fulbright:
Your wish is my command!
Judge:
Very well, then. I guess we'll just wait right here.
Blackquill:
......It would seem the fingerprint analysis is complete.
Judge:
What do the results show?
Blackquill:
What in the world...!
Apollo:
They're Florent L'Belle's prints, aren't they?!
Blackquill:
This... This is absurd!
Apollo:
Um... Prosecutor Blackquill? (I'm not going to like this, am I...?)
Judge:
D-Don't tell me... they're Tenma Taro's prints?!
Blackquill:
Fingerprint analysis has revealed that the prints belong to... ............Phineas Filch.
Apollo:
Apollo:
...Wait, what? Whaaaaaaaaat!
Athena:
The Mr. L'Belle wasn't the one who entered the Forbidden Chamber?
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
Why you tricksy little tanuki! Explain yourself, now!
Filch:
S-S-Sure, th-them prints are mine! I mean, I did pilfer that hand cream from Mr. L'Belle, after all!
Apollo:
S-So you're the one who entered the Forbidden Chamber?!
Filch:
S-So what if I did! G-G-Got a problem with it?! Yiiiiiipes!
Blackquill:
You...... fool of a tanuki!
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Justice, care to explain what this could mean?
Apollo:
Excellent question... Um, the fact that Mr. Filch was in the Forbidden Chamber... Wait a second... Does this mean the Tenma Taro holding that staff was... Phineas Filch?
Filch:
Yiiiiiipes! Another cat outta the baaaaaag!
Judge:
M-Mr. Filch is Tenma Taro?!
Apollo:
I don't understand. Does this mean... Mr. Filch is the real killer?
Judge:
The witness will explain himself this instant!
Filch:
Begging your pardon, Your Honorship, but I was just doing what the alderman told me. He wanted me to be Tenma Taro in the village exorcism ritual.
Apollo:
Oh, you mean that event at the Nine-Tails Vale festival. So, that was you inside the Tenma Taro costume.
Filch:
Yep. And after the event, I went to watch that pro wrestling program... ...but it bored me to tears on account o' the wrestlers being complete jobbers.
Apollo:
(So, he didn't actually watch the entire wrestling match.)
Filch:
That's when I looked at the Tenma Taro costume and got a great idea! Nobody can tell it's me while I'm wearing it... ...and 'cause o' them superstitions, no matter what I do, the villages [sic] won't say a word!
Judge:
In other words, you used the superstitions to effectively render yourself invisible.
Apollo:
Why did you want to enter the Forbidden Chamber in the first place?
Filch:
'Cause o' the treasure there! Thought that was my big chance to sneak on in 'n' nab it!
Apollo:
Treasure?
Filch:
Eh heh heh. Only that it's the greatest get-rich-quick chance in the universe. Grandpappy told me all about it. Said there's an amazing treasure in there!
Apollo:
(He went in there not knowing his grandfather had already pilfered it?)
Athena:
Guess this is one tale that didn't get passed down from grandpappy to grandson.
Apollo:
Wait, how exactly did you get into the Forbidden Chamber? There was a meeting in the Fox Chamber that day. Plus, the mayor swallowed the only key that could open the Forbidden Chamber's door. You couldn't have possibly gotten in!
Filch:
I could through the air vent in the foyer! The vent's left o' the alderman's picture. I went on in and made a nice little hole. Used that to get into the air duct that leads to the Forbidden Chamber, I did!
Apollo:
You what?!
Athena:
B-But how's that even possible? ...Wait a sec...! Remember that air vent in the Forbidden Chamber? So, Mr. Filch found a way to get into that air duct... ...and that's how he got from the foyer vent to the Forbidden Chamber vent?
Judge:
Hmm... So, Tenma Taro was nothing more than a cat burglar -- or rather, a tanuki burglar. And we're back to being without anyone to charge for the alderman's murder.
Athena:
Looks like our so-called yokai is nothing more than one big troublemaker.
Apollo:
Tell me, Mr. Filch, what did you do after fleeing to the foyer?
Filch:
I got outta that costume real quick. Woulda just caused trouble at that point!
Apollo:
And where is that costume now?
Filch:
Heck if I know. And it ain't my fault if ya never find it.
Blackquill:
The police searched every nook and cranny. No yokai costume was left in that manor.
Apollo:
(What if it was tossed outside the manor? ...Ah!) No way! But maybe, just maybe...!
Judge:
The defense seems to have hit upon an idea. Well, go on, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
Okay, here's what I think... Mr. Filch! Did you get rid of the costume here?
Present window
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Did you toss it out the window?"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Blackquill:
I already told you. Every nook and cranny of the manor was searched. No costume was ever recovered.
Judge:
The defense will remember to pay attention from now on!
Apollo:
Ack. (If the costume wasn't in the manor, then maybe it was thrown out somewhere.)
Leads back to:
"Mr. Filch! Did you get rid of the costume here?"
Apollo:
Did you toss it out the window? Because that would certainly explain why it didn't turn up inside the manor!
Filch:
You think I tossed it out the window? That costume cost me a pretty penny! So why would I go do something like that?!
Apollo:
(I can think of a few reasons...)
Athena:
Any bright ideas, Apollo?
Apollo:
Well, assuming the costume really was tossed out from the window... ...then the next question would be, what happened to it after that? (And if I'm right, I might have just the thing to prove what happened to the costume.) Phineas Filch......... I have just the evidence for you!
Filch:
Ya do?
Apollo:
This evidence proves you got rid of your Tenma Taro costume through the window!
Present Special Edition Paper
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Ah, that's..."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Judge:
And just how does that prove he got rid of it?
Apollo:
It doesn't, does it?
Judge:
No, it does not.
Apollo:
Ack. (Back to the drawing board. What would happen if the costume was tossed out the window? I must have some sort of evidence that can show what would happen!)
Leads back to:
"This evidence proves you got rid of your Tenma Taro costume through the window!"
Filch:
Ah, that's... ...Tenma Taro flying through the sky?
Judge:
And just how does that prove Mr. Filch threw his costume out the window?
Apollo:
It's quite simple. That's not Tenma Taro in the photo. It's the costume Mr. Filch threw out.
Filch:
Aw, that's crazy talk! You ain't serious, are ya?!
Apollo:
There's a steep cliff right outside the foyer window, meaning the manor is pretty high up. The costume flew through the air after it was tossed out. That's when the photo was taken. In other words, the photo of Tenma Taro really was a flight of fancy!
Judge:
Wh-Whaaaaaat?!
Filch:
Yiiiiiiiiiiikes!
Judge:
Oh, my! So there really never was a yokai.
Filch:
Aw, I can't keep any o' them cats bagged! Can I still file a claim for the lost costume?
Apollo:
This more than proves the defense's position. Jinxie Tenma had nothing to do with staging the yokai sighting.
Judge:
Care to raise any objections, Prosecutor Blackquill?
Blackquill:
............None whatsoever. I'll deal with that tricksy tanuki after I've dealt with this case.
Apollo:
(We... We did it!)
Athena:
Good going! Now all we have to do is make Florent L'Belle take the stand!
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
Sheathing the sword a bit early, are we not?
Apollo:
Huh?!
Blackquill:
Nothing has been proved beyond a doubt. Take this tricksy little tanuki for instance. How do you suppose he was able to exit the Forbidden Chamber?
Apollo:
Uh... Probably the same way he got in -- through the chamber's air vent!
Blackquill:
And what of the feathers and tracks at the scene of the crime? They would suggest that the tanuki exited through the chamber door, not the air vent.
Apollo:
Apollo:
But the Forbidden Chamber doesn't open from the inside! So what you're saying makes no sense! ............Right?
Blackquill:
......Hmph. Someone on the outside opened the door for you, isn't that right?
Filch:
Yep, that's right, Mr. Blackjack! The door suddenly sprung right open!
Apollo:
Apollo:
Sprung right open? Who was on the other side?
Filch:
Didn't get a good look on account o' the sudden glare.
Judge:
Like how the reflection from my head blinds fellow moviegoers emerging from the dark.
Filch:
That's when I snatched that staff and made my daring escape! And then that lil' maid gal spotted me as I high-tailed it down the hall!
Athena:
That means the Forbidden Chamber wasn't opened until after the crime was discovered.
Apollo:
But wait... We still don't know who opened it. Maybe there really was a third person in the Fox Chamber.
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
Well, you little tanuki? When the Forbidden Chamber opened, did you see the accused passed out there?
Filch:
Nope. Only one there was the alderman, and he was dead as a doornail.
Blackquill:
Hmph. If the accused wasn't there, what do you suppose he was up to?
Apollo:
Uh-oh. I don't like where this is going.
Judge:
Ah! Don't tell me--!
Blackquill:
Plainly, the only one who could have opened the Forbidden Chamber was... ...the accused Damian Tenma!
Apollo:
Arrrgh!
Athena:
Athena:
Wait a second! There had to be somebody else besides Mayor Tenma there!
Judge:
Really? And who might that be?
Athena:
Oh, well, that would be...
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
It seems our feisty little lass has forgotten the most important thing: evidence.
Athena:
I didn't forget...! I was just... testing your attention to details...?
Judge:
Ms. Cykes! You can't prove your point without proof of some sort! It's a proven fact!
Athena:
Sorry... Guess I put my foot in my mouth again.
Apollo:
No, Athena. We're definitely on to something here.
Athena:
We are?
Apollo:
Think about it. If Filch was stuck inside the Forbidden Chamber... ...one of the alibis we heard would no longer hold any water! The defense would like to call a new witness to the stand! Someone who knew Mr. Filch was stuck in the Forbidden Chamber! And by virtue of knowing this, has an alibi that no longer adds up!
Blackquill:
Ah! Not that insufferable--!
Judge:
Very well. The court will hear what Mr. Justice has to say. Whose alibi no longer adds up?
Present Florent L'Belle profile
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Why, that's... that's the defendant's aide, Florent L'Belle."
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Apollo:
It's this person right here!
Judge:
Really?! Please explain, Mr. Justice. How does this person's alibi has vanish [sic] in this case?
Apollo:
Err... You know how your hand vanishes when you stick it into a dark room? Kinda like that.
Judge:
............ Keep making half-baked statements like that... ...and it'll be the court's trust in you that will vanish!
Apollo:
Oh, uh... just kidding, heh heh.
Judge:
A penalty to dissuade the very unfunny Mr. Justice from pursuing a career in comedy.
Apollo:
(We know Filch was in the Forbidden Chamber at the time of the murder. Which means...) Your Honor! There IS someone whose alibi no longer adds up!
Judge:
Very well. You may try once again.
Leads back to:
"Whose alibi no longer adds up?"
Judge:
Why, that's... that's the defendant's aide, Florent L'Belle. Didn't he claim to be in the foyer at the time of the crime?
Apollo:
True, but in his alibi, he also claimed Mr. Filch was in the foyer, too. However, as we all know now, Mr. Filch was NOT there with Mr. L'Belle at that time. In short, Mr. L'Belle's alibi has disappeared!
Blackquill:
Argh!
Apollo:
Florent L'Belle's alibi was one big lie! Isn't that right, Mr. Filch!
Filch:
I reckon there ain't no keepin' that cat in the bag here, neither. It was all Mr. L'Belle's idea. He told me he'd button his lip about me breaking into the Forbidden Chamber. And in return, he said we'd vouch for each other's alibi.
Judge:
Shame on you, Mr. Filch! Perjury is a serious crime, you know!
Filch:
Aw, shucks... Mercy, Your Honorship, mercy! Aaaaaaaaagh!
Apollo:
I also assert that the person who opened the Forbidden Chamber for Mr. Filch... ...was none other than Florent L'Belle! After all, his alibi has just been proven to be a complete fabrication!
Judge:
...I see. We will take a twenty-minute recess... ...after which time we will see what Mr. L'Belle has to say for himself.
Apollo:
(Yes! We're finally going to drag that slippery snake onto the stand!)
Blackquill:
.........
Judge:
In the meantime, the prosecution will question Mr. L'Belle about these new allegations!
April 19, 10:25 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3
Athena:
We did it, Apollo! We finally dragged Mr. L'Belle into court!
Apollo:
...Yeah.
Athena:
Hey, why the long face?
Apollo:
I can't help but feel I'm missing something important. Plus, Prosecutor Blackquill's bound to mount a counterattack.
Athena:
You really are a worrywart, aren't you? It'll be fine! That mystery figure who opened the Forbidden Chamber for Mr. Filch... ...had to have been Florent L'Belle!
Apollo:
I know. But that's not what's bugging me. I wish I could put my finger on it, though...
Athena:
At any rate, the big showdown with Mr. L'Belle is up next, so chin up, Apollo!
April 19, 11:00 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4
Judge:
Court is back in session. Our next witness is--
L'Belle:
...Yes. I'm ACTING on behalf of the mayor in this VERY important matter.
Judge:
It seems the witness is predisposed at the moment.
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! SURELY you jest! I will hold you to your promise, remember that. Oh, my DEEPEST apologies. This is Florent L'Belle, PERSONAL aide to Mayor Tenma -- or should I say -- the accused.
Apollo:
(Ouch, like the poor mayor hasn't suffered enough...)
L'Belle:
Well, what business do YOU have with ME? I'm a VERY busy man, so let's make this as BRIEF as possible.
Blackquill:
......Your Baldness.
Judge:
Ah, right. *ahem* Mr. Filch's testimony has revealed a hole in your alibi. And for this reason... ...you are suspected of having some sort of connection with the case at hand.
L'Belle:
Pffft. To think I'D be associated with this entirely lurid affair. Well, I'm NOT, so may I go now? I have VERY important matters to attend to.
Apollo:
Apollo:
I don't think so, Mr. L'Belle! Do you realize what a serious crime you've committed?!
Judge:
Witness, you are being accused of perjury. This is your chance to clear the air.
L'Belle:
Fine. The truth is I faked my alibi for a VERY good reason. The mayor was OBVIOUSLY the killer, so I created a fake alibi to confuse the matter. You see, as his PERSONAL aide, I felt I HAD to protect him. SORRY! Ah ha ha ha!
Apollo:
You think this is funny?! Without your alibi, you're a suspect, too! What were you really doing at the time of the crime?!
L'Belle:
Pffft, PEASANT! How dare YOU accuse ME, one of the BEAUTIFUL people, of being--
Athena:
Athena:
Stop stalling and tell the court what you were really doing at the time of the crime!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Athena:
.........
.........
Blackquill:
.........Enough jabbering. Swords have been drawn. The time for talk is past.
Apollo:
Swords? What swords?
Blackquill:
This is a duel to the death. The fate of the accused rests in our hands. Be gone, ye of cowardly heart! The battlefield hath no place for ye!
Apollo:
Again...?
L'Belle:
Oh, my.
Judge:
Spare me, pleeeeease!
Apollo:
So much for sturdier shackles. Aagh!
Blackquill:
Those chains hindered my vow that heads would roll this day.
Apollo:
(This gives "keeping your head on in court" a whole new meaning!)
Blackquill:
Will the witness please deliver the accused's death knell? You know of what I speak.
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! Most CERTAINLY. His GOOSE is already COOKED. Time to stick a fork in him!
Apollo:
(Whatever he has to say can't be good.)
L'Belle:
As I TOLD Prosecutor Blackquill during the recess... ...I RUSHED right over to the Fox Chamber when I heard little Jinxie scream.
Apollo:
What?
L'Belle:
THEN -- drum roll please... ...I saw Mayor Tenma OPENING the Forbidden Chamber doors.
Apollo:
B-B-But...
Blackquill:
There you have it. The mystery man who opened the chamber door -- as witnessed by one Phineas Filch... It was the accused. There was never any third party.
L'Belle:
......Oh, and THAT'S not all! I heard something QUITE startling there at the scene of the crime!
Apollo:
Startling sounds bad...
L'Belle:
The mayor, who was barely conscious, muttered this... "Forgive me, Jinxie. I killed the alderman." That's right! The mayor ACTUALLY confessed to the murder right then and there!
Judge:
H-H-He confessed?! Order! Order in the court! This is quite conclusive testimony if it stands!
Blackquill:
Just so. And quite astonishing, I might add. I only learned of this fact during the recess.
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! I just LOVE surprises, don't you? That's why I saved the best for last. Consider it a gift from ME to YOU!
Athena:
No way. I don't believe Mr. L'Belle heard the mayor confess.
Judge:
But... but is this really true? Did Mayor Tenma really confess?
Blackquill:
It is, indeed. During that last recess, I confirmed it with the mayor's daughter. It would seem Mayor Tenma actually did confess.
Judge:
Hmm... That testimony is quite favorable to the prosecution's--
L'Belle:
This is L'Belle. Yes, I called earlier about the PARTY reservations. That's right. And I'll be calling MY little shindig "Mayor Tenma's Conviction Gala." A SPLENDID time is guaranteed for all -- all but the mayor and his defense, ah ha ha ha!
Judge:
Well, as it seems our witness is a very busy man, let's get right to his testimony. Mr. L'Belle, please tell us what you saw when you came upon the scene of the crime.
Witness Testimony
-- What L'Belle Saw --
L'Belle:
I was in the hallway, HIDING in the shadows. THAT'S when I heard the confession.
Upon LEARNING of her father's crime, little Jinxie fled without EVER noticing me.
Immediately AFTER that, the mayor came to, stood up and opened the Forbidden Chamber!
As I ran in TERROR, the demon emerged from his prison!
In shock, I FLED down the hallway to my right -- the one with the PHONE at the end.
Judge:
I must say... this is a shocking revelation... Quite unexpected. To think the defendant actually confessed then and there to his crime!
L'Belle:
Perhaps the guilt was TOO much to bear, so he confided in his daughter.
Judge:
You do realize you should not have withheld such crucial testimony from the court!
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! Once again, SORRY! It's just, I feared being accused if I mentioned coming upon that MOST unpleasant scene.
Apollo:
Argh. Why did the mayor's confession have to be brought up by THIS guy...
Athena:
We better do something before the judge declares the mayor guilty!
Blackquill:
...Hmph. As a death row inmate once told me in years gone by... "There is a time to fight and a time to yield. A time to live, and a time to die."
Apollo:
Arrrgh! (He's laying it on real thick now.)
Judge:
The defense may now cross-examine the witness.

Apollo:
Apollo:
You claim that the mayor confessed to his daughter. Are you sure about that?
L'Belle:
PEASANT! You wouldn't DARE ask such a question if you truly understood. TRUE beauty is never wrong.
Apollo:
It's not?
L'Belle:
No, beauty is carved DEEP in the DNA. That means I'M programmed to ALWAYS be right, EVEN when I'm wrong.
Apollo:
I'm not following.
L'Belle:
These exquisite ears like flowers abloom... These eyes that shine like pearls... This hair like the finest silk... Nothing can corrupt the truth they hold!
Apollo:
Uh... right...
Judge:
Hmm... The witness will hurry up and explain this truth of his. Specifically, what did Jinxie Tenma do upon hearing the confession?
L'Belle:
Upon LEARNING of her father's crime, little Jinxie fled without EVER noticing me.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
How did Ms. Tenma appear to you?
L'Belle:
Oh, the poor little thing seemed POSITIVELY heartbroken -- all teary eyed and whatnot. I couldn't help but shed a few tears myself after seeing her like that.
Athena:
He actually sympathized with Jinxie? Seems like an overly human emotion for him.
Apollo:
Yeah, because he's the only real monster we've seen so far -- in looks and in character.
L'Belle:
The NEXT thing I did was check my face in the mirror.
Apollo:
Checked your face? Why?
L'Belle:
Pffft! To behold the beauty that is my sadness, why else!
Athena:
...Apollo, I'm starting to lose all faith in humanity.
Apollo:
I know the feeling, but hang in there. At least keep faith in our client.
Judge:
Let's keep moving, shall we? So what happened next?
L'Belle:
Immediately AFTER that, the mayor came to, stood up and opened the Forbidden Chamber!
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
He opened the Forbidden Chamber? But why would he do that?
L'Belle:
Who knows? MAYBE he wanted to free the demon, Tenma Taro?
Apollo:
Apollo:
The courtroom is no place for fairytales! Remember, you ARE under oath!
L'Belle:
Hello? L'Belle speaking. ...Yes, I will CERTAINLY explore the matter. Toodles! Now, WHERE were we again?
Apollo:
You were going to tell us the real reason why the mayor opened the Forbidden Chamber!
L'Belle:
Oh, yes! Of course. Hello? This is L'Belle. ...A ha ha ha! Good one, sir! You're an ABSOLUTE riot. ...Okay, bye. You were saying?
Apollo:
Never mind. (This is a waste of time. He's just going to tell more lies.)
Judge:
The witness will focus on his testimony, not his phone calls. Now, tell the court what you did after you saw the mayor open the Forbidden Chamber.
L'Belle:
Well, after THAT...
L'Belle:
As I ran in TERROR, the demon emerged from his prison!
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
What was Mr. Filch like at the time?
L'Belle:
He was shouting, "I can't see! I can't see! It's the curse o' Tenma Taro!" THEN, he took off running like a MADMAN.
Apollo:
He must've been blinded by the sudden light flooding in.
L'Belle:
Wrong.
Apollo:
What?
L'Belle:
He set EYES upon me... ...and was thus BLINDED by my radiant beauty!
Apollo:
.........
Athena:
...So, it was the curse of Florent L'Belle, rather than Tenma Taro?
L'Belle:
Yes, I'm afraid such beauty can be a curse. It's almost criminal.
Blackquill:
...The only thing criminal here... is your ceaseless jabbering. Now, get on with your testimony.
L'Belle:
Oh, forgive me, Your Darkness. Let's see... Oh, yes. I FLED for dear life from Tenma Taro, and...
L'Belle:
In shock, I FLED down the hallway to my right -- the one with the PHONE at the end.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
So, after you fled into the hallway with the phone at the end... ...Tenma Taro ran off toward the foyer?
L'Belle:
PRECISELY.
Athena:
Notice any inconsistencies, Apollo?
Apollo:
Well, Jinxie also saw Tenma Taro, right?
Athena:
She did. She said they passed each other in the hall after she made that call to the police.
Apollo:
Well, if L'Belle had fled down the hall where that phone is... ...Jinxie would've seen him when she was returning from making her call.
Athena:
Oh, right. And if she saw him, she would've definitely asked him for help.
Apollo:
Right. It just doesn't make any sense. (Time to review the evidence.)
Present Jinxie's Statement
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Florent L'Belle, you're lying about having witnessed those events from the hallway!"
Athena:
If we don't find some way to poke a hole in his testimony... ...Mayor Tenma is as good as guilty!
Apollo:
This is bad, very bad.
Athena:
We need to find an inconsistency, a mistake, some kind of conflict!
Apollo:
(It's all over if we can't find a flaw in the prosecution's case!)
Apollo:
Florent L'Belle, you're lying about having witnessed those events from the hallway!
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! What on EARTH do you mean?
Judge:
Yes, care to fill the rest of us in, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
If Mr. L'Belle had really fled down into the hall with the phone in it... ...he would've crossed paths with Ms. Tenma.
L'Belle:
...What's this?
Apollo:
After she discovered the crime scene, she immediately went to call the police. Then, after making her call, she went back to the main hallway... ...whereupon she encountered the demon, yokai, or whatever you want to call it. As for me, I call it Phineas Filch in a Tenma Taro costume! The encounter happened right there, where the hallways meet. As for Mr. L'Belle, if he had fled here, feigning escape from the yokai imposter...
Judge:
Why, yes! The two would've crossed paths!
Apollo:
Right. Except Ms. Tenma told us that "there was no one else in the hall." In short, Ms. Tenma did not see you in the hall because you were never really there!
L'Belle:
Aaaaaah! My eyes! My beautiful eyes!
Apollo:
(Hah! Not such a FABULOUS scent now, is it!)
Judge:
But Mr. Justice, the witness also stated that he heard the mayor confess. If he was lying about hearing the confession from the hall... ...then where was he when he heard it?
Apollo:
Inside the Fox Chamber, where else?
Judge:
Hmm... But isn't that within the very crime scene?!
Apollo:
It is, Your Honor. And that means he's not really a witness. Rather, he's the third party I've been alleging this whole time!
L'Belle:
What?! You think I'M the killer? How DARE you!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
Foolish fop. A true man knows when he is beaten. A shield of lies comes to naught before a foe with the sword of truth bared.
L'Belle:
P-Prosecutor Blackquill, what ARE you...? I thought WE were on the SAME side?
Blackquill:
You are mistaken. There are no sides here, save for my cold, steely edge of judgment. You are alone upon this battlefield, with naught but your lies and sickly sweet perfume.
Apollo:
(Whoa, what just happened? Blackquill's really tearing into him!)
Blackquill:
You heard the mayor's confession from the inside, did you not, you deviant dandy? For the sole location from which you could've seen and heard the mayor and the tanuki... ...without either of them noticing you was right there in the Fox Chamber.
L'Belle:
.........Oh, my. So THAT'S how it's going to be? Fine, I'll come clean, then.
Apollo:
Seriously? You admit to being there in the Fox Chamber?
L'Belle:
I do! I DID enter the room AFTER the murder. But I was afraid of being FALSELY accused, so I lied about it. I feel TERRIBLE about lying like that. But it's a verbal cologne I use to PROTECT myself.
Apollo:
You'd better explain yourself, Mr. L'Belle!
L'Belle:
Yes, of course! I was JUST about to get to that!
Judge:
The witness is skating on thin ice. I'll remind you that perjury is a very serious crime. Now, let's hear your testimony again, this time without your perfume of lies.
Witness Testimony
-- In the Fox Chamber --
L'Belle:
I DID enter the Fox Chamber after the murder.
But I DIDN'T enter until AFTER Jinxie had heard the confession and left.
I HEARD the mayor groan and hid behind the folding screen there.
What I saw there up close... It was absolutely HORRIFYING!
So you SEE, I was THERE, but merely watching from behind the screen.
Judge:
From behind the screen? Why, yes, I believe you wouldn't be spotted if you were there.
Blackquill:
Just so. He could see everything without being spotted by the victim or that tanuki Filch. Suffice to say, he was mere witness to the events, rather than an actual third party.
Apollo:
......... (This guy's as slippery as an eel.)
Athena:
Apollo, you think he's telling the truth?
Apollo:
Well, he WAS in the Fox Chamber, so at least that much must be true.
Judge:
The defense may cross-examine our slightly voyeuristic witness.

It was designed PERSONALLY by me. I was WORRIED my work of art might get blood on it.

By hiding, I was concealing my FABULOUS beauty, which, for the sake of the universe... ...is something I should NEVER EVER do! THAT'S what you were thinking, right?
Apollo:

We can deliberate his mental process another time. Get on with the testimony. Now!

Well, regarding the murder scene...

Apollo:
Could you describe the crime scene in a bit more detail?
L'Belle:
Hm? And WHAT exactly would you like DETAILS about?
Apollo:
Well, what I'd like to ask you about is...
The feathers and tracks
Apollo:
What do you remember about the yokai feathers and tracks?
L'Belle:
They RESULTED when Tenma Taro EXITED the Forbidden Chamber. He came out in QUITE a rush, scattering feathers THIS way and THAT.
Apollo:
Did you immediately know it was Mr. Filch?
L'Belle:
I did. And THAT'S why I suggested we cook up our alibis together.
Apollo:
And how did those practice sessions go?
L'Belle:
They were NEARLY the death of me. Filchy has to be the WORST STUDENT EVER.
Athena:
He really doesn't think he's done anything wrong, does he?
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? Do you consider his statement to be of any importance?
Apollo:
(Is it important?)
Very important
Apollo:
Yes, I believe it is, Your Honor. I request that it be added to the testimony!
Add statement:
"The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened."
Not so important
Apollo:
(It's probably not particularly important.) No, Your Honor. The witness may proceed.
L'Belle:
All right, then. I would JUST like to add that it was a TERRIBLY grisly scene, as I have described.

The Forbidden Chamber
Apollo:
Could you please describe the Forbidden Chamber at the time?
L'Belle:
It was SHUT tight until the MAYOR opened it.
Apollo:
(He's really trying to stress that it was the mayor who opened the Forbidden Chamber.)

Tsk, that big liar! He opened it himself!

Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? Do you consider his statement to be of any importance?

The murder weapon
Apollo:
Could you describe the state of the weapons that had been used at the scene?
L'Belle:
The spear had been thrust ALL the way through Alderman Kyubi. Then there was that STATUE the alderman used to BLUDGEON Mayor Tenma. That INCREDIBLY inspiring symbol had fallen to the floor.
Apollo:
(Oh, right, the statue... But why would he find it inspiring?) Why exactly did you find the statue inspiring?
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! Well! When I saw THAT statue... I felt as if the MERGER had been realized! It was like... ...a celebration of union between town and village -- an INSPIRING symbol of goodwill!
Apollo:
(A broken statue next to a bloody corpse... Real inspiring...)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? Do you consider his statement to be of any importance?
Apollo:

Very important
Leads to:
"I believe that to be extremely importantly [sic]!"

In this world RIDDLED with deceit, my beauty is the ONLY self-evident truth! That is to say, all else except me is but fiction and lies.

Apollo:
Apollo:
A token of goodwill... Are you referring to the fox and demon statue?

Yes, the STATUE the alderman allegedly use to STRIKE BACK at Mayor Tenma. The mayor TRAMPLED down municipal goodwill only to be CLOBBERED by its symbol! It's QUITE ironic, don't you think?

Apollo:
Apollo:
The mayor had been knocked out by a blow to the head. Could he really have opened the Forbidden Chamber in that state?
L'Belle:
Well, it DID seem difficult. He was ALL woozy and stumbling around as he opened it. It was SUCH a heroic effort that I NEARLY started to cheer him on despite myself!
Apollo:
(I think the mayor needed medical attention more than a cheerleader.)
Athena:
You think he's telling the truth about being there in that room?
Apollo:
Well, I believe he was there... The question is, when did he enter?
Athena:
You mean, did he enter after Jinxie fled... ...or was he there before the murder? If it's the latter, that would change everything.
Apollo:
Right. If he was there before the murder, that would make him a suspect.
Athena:
But how do we go about proving that?
Apollo:
Well... I guess we ask him about what happened there. Anyway, let's press him and see what kind of info we can extract from him.
Athena:
Let's cross our fingers that he says or reveals something incriminating.
Apollo:
Your lies have finally betrayed you, Mr. L'Belle!
L'Belle:
What POSSIBLY could you mean?
Apollo:
You said this statue was "like a celebration of union between town and village." Isn't that correct?!

It is indeed! But WHAT of it? The two yokai ARE joining hands in goodwill... ...as if they were CELEBRATING the municipal merger!
Apollo:
............
L'Belle:
.........Something the matter?
Apollo:
So, how did you really know that this statue was meant to be a symbol of goodwill again?
L'Belle:
What?
Blackquill:
.........Justice-dono, explain yourself. And make it quick.
Apollo:
This statue WAS meant to symbolize goodwill in its original form, but that was a secret.
L'Belle:
A secret? What EVER do you mean?!
Apollo:
What I mean is that it broke when someone used it to strike Mayor Tenma on the head. What's left clearly makes it look like the two yokai are battling it out!
L'Belle:
Eep!
Apollo:
The statue's secret and its true form were lost inside that locked room. For Ms. Tenma is the only living soul who should know what it once looked like. So, Mr. L'Belle, where could you have possibly seen the statue in its original form?
L'Belle:
! P-Pffft! What do you mean, WHERE?!
Apollo:
The only possible answer is this! You saw the statue in its original form... ...right there in the room where the alderman was murdered before it was broken!
L'Belle:
How DARE you!
Judge:
M-Mr. Justice! Are you accusing the witness with some sort of crime?
Apollo:
...Yes. Yes I am. Florent L'Belle! I accuse you of the murder of Alderman Rex Kyubi!
L'Belle:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. L'Belle! You've been accused of murder. Do you have anything to say in your defense?
L'Belle:
...Arrrrrrgh! How could YOU possibly accuse ME -- the EMBODIMENT of BEAUTY!
Athena:
Way to go, Apollo! This is the conclusive evidence we needed! Magnifico!
Apollo:
We've got you now! We know you killed the alderman. Now, admit it!
L'Belle:
I-I... I... Aaaagh!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
Enough of your silly games, Justice-dono. This prancing peacock could not possibly be the killer.
Apollo:
Apollo:
What are you talking about?! His alibi has already crumbled to dust! And I just proved that he was in the Fox Chamber while it was still locked tight!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
Why could he have not seen the statue in its true form before the murder? After all, he was close friends with the alderman. Ergo...
L'Belle:
Y-Yes, th-that's right! I CLEARLY remember it now! Alderman Kyubi TOLD me about it. ...About what the statue ACTUALLY looked like! I mean, he WAS a good friend of mine, ah ha ha ha!
Athena:
Athena:
Yeah, right! He wouldn't show you a secret gift just like that!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
Moreover, it has already been proven that he was not present at the scene of the crime.
Athena:
It has?
Blackquill:
Forgotten, have we? Recall the little scamp's statement if you will. When Jinxie Tenma unlocked the Fox Chamber... ...she saw the alderman and the mayor collapsed therein -- and no one else.
Athena:
Oh.
Apollo:
Dangit.
Blackquill:
The fact is, it was you two who made that apparent in yesterday's court session. Thus, Florent L'Belle could not possibly have been in that locked room!
Apollo:
Urrrrghhnnn...
Athena:
Nooooooooo...
Apollo:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! (I just don't get it. How could Jinxie not have seen L'Belle?)
Blackquill:
.........The proof is incontrovertible. No room for debate exists. Am I not right, Your Baldness?
Judge:
Hmm... It does seem awfully conclusive. The facts point to the defendant and victim being the only people in that locked room. Moreover, the defendant has already confessed.
Apollo:
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
You cannot defend the indefensible. Your role in this charade is over, Justice-dono.
Apollo:
B-B-But...
Blackquill:
Your Baldness... This trial would last an eternity if we were to keep crossing blades with these simpletons. It is high time you brought down the hammer of justice.
Judge:
...A point well made. I believe it's time to declare a verdict. This court finds the defendant, Damian Tenma...
Tenma:
Tenma:
Caw caw-caw-caw! It would seem that my time is at hand!
Apollo:
M-Mayor Tenma?
Tenma:
Counselor! There is a matter to which I must testify! I recall it now only for your good graces.
Apollo:
C-Counselor? Oh, right, he must mean me. (Has he finally remembered what happened before that blow to his head?)
Blackquill:
Bailiff! Don't just stand there! Seize him!
Bailiff:
It's no good! I can't restrain him!
Tenma:
Caw caw-caw-caw! Know me and despair! For I am Tenma Taro, demon lord of the yokai!
Judge:
M-Mr. Justice! Do something!
Apollo:
(Since when am I responsible for court security?!)
Athena:
Apollo, this is our chance! We might get some new information out of him!
Apollo:
Y-Your Honor! Seeing as our client has something new to say... ...I believe due process demands that we hear him out, even if he is a yokai!
Judge:
Hmm... When you put it that way... .........Still, I believe testimony by a yokai is unprecedented in the legal world.
Blackquill:
Hmph. Unprecedented in absurdity more like.
Judge:
All right then, Mr. Damian Tenma -- or should I say, Mr. Tenma Taro. Your testimony, please.
Tenma:
I shall now speak of recollections most real, courtesy of my host Damian Tenma. Heed these words, mortals, for hear them but once you shall! Caw caw-caw-caw!
Witness Testimony
-- The Ruler of Demonkind --
Tenma:
Barely conscious was Damian there amid the darkness.
Suddenly, two yokai did appear!
On one side, I, Tenma Taro, ruler of demonkind!
And on the other, my mortal enemy, the Nine-Tailed Fox!
Apollo:
............
Athena:
............
Judge:
............Umm... So, is the defendant asserting that the room he was in was very dark at the time?
Tenma:
Hrmm. Strange as it may be, yes, indeed, all was in darkness.
Apollo:
And the part about Tenma Taro and the Nine-Tailed Fox being there?
Tenma:
Yes, that, too! Tenma Taro towered overhead and the Nine-Tailed Fox glittered gold!
Apollo:
.........Aaaaah! I call animal abuse, Your Honor!
Blackquill:
...Hmph. It would seem the defendant's recollections are not to be trusted.
Tenma:
Yes, well, truth be told, my host's recollections are still a bit fuzzy. As if half dreamt, that happening lingers in his mind.
Athena:
...Apollo. Maybe I can help here.
Apollo:
Really? Oh, you mean...?
Athena:
Yeah, I can hear it. The discord in his heart. I sense an unusual emotion in the mayor's memory of the event.
Apollo:
Okay, I just hope our findings don't come back to haunt us... again.
Tenma:
Barely conscious was Damian there amid the darkness.
Tenma:
Suddenly, two yokai did appear!
Tenma:
On, one side, I, Tenma Taro, ruler of demonkind!
Tenma:
And on the other, my mortal enemy, the Nine-Tailed Fox!
Pinpoint Happiness
Apollo:
Got it!
Leads to:
"When the Nine-Tailed Fox appeared, you not only experienced shock and sadness..."
Athena:
It sounds like the mayor saw the same thing as what's shown on that scroll.
Apollo:
What's with those Tenmas and their yokai vision?
Athena:
I think it's sweet how father and daughter can share something like that.
Apollo:
(I don't think a shared nightmare really qualifies as sweet.) Anyway, all I need to do is point out an unnatural reaction like last time?
Athena:
Right. Look for places where an emotion conflicts with the testimony. That conflict usually indicates a thought or emotion that is being suppressed.
Apollo:
When the Nine-Tailed Fox appeared, you not only experienced shock and sadness... ...but also, something like joy as well.
Tenma:
Joy? Hmm... Perhaps it was joy at the light coming to my eyes at long last. A long and terrible creaking did pierce the silence... ...and then there was light! On reflection, it was a door that did produce that infernal racket.
Apollo:
A creaking door? Oh, you must be talking about the Forbidden Chamber door. It does make a lot of noise.
Athena:
So, this means the Forbidden Chamber really was opened. But what about the sudden light he described?
Apollo:
I think I know! He mentioned darkness and Tenma Taro towering overhead. Maybe the mayor wasn't really in the Fox Chamber at the time of the crime! Mr. Mayor! Did the darkness that you were in happen to be here?
Present Forbidden Chamber
Apollo:
Leads to:
"The Forbidden Chamber?! Was it not the Fox Chamber where the murder did occur?"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Apollo:
Mayor Tenma, the darkness you were in was... right here!
Tenma:
Hrrrm? You claim I was there? No such recollections do I possess.
Apollo:
That's just because your memory is still hazy!
Tenma:
Hrmm... On further reflection, I believe that... ...you are gravely misguided!
Apollo:
Huh?
Athena:
He means you got that one wrong, Apollo.
Tenma:
Counselor! I expect attempts of a more serious nature from you!
Apollo:
All right, let's think that one over again.
Leads back to:
"Mr. Mayor! Did the darkness that you were in happen to be here?"
Tenma:
The Forbidden Chamber?! Was it not the Fox Chamber where the murder did occur?
Apollo:
Yes, but it all makes sense if you were in the Forbidden Chamber! That terrible creaking sound was probably the Forbidden Chamber's door opening. And the towering Tenma Taro you saw? Most likely the Forbidden Chamber's statue!
Tenma:
Why, yes! That would explain it! The darkness and the staff in the demon's grasp!
Athena:
But even if all that's true, then what about the Nine-Tailed Fox?
Apollo:
Umm... Maybe he was seeing things, just like Jinxie and her imaginary yokai.
Athena:
FantÃ¡stico, Apollo! It's entirely possible! In a groggy, dream-like state, people can misremember things and events.
Tenma:
Misremember, you say? Hrmm. Let me think. ...Ah! I do believe... I remember now! That... that was not the Nine-Tailed Fox. It was... ...The Amazing Nine-Tails!
Apollo:
Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaat! Th-The Amazing Nine-Tails?
Tenma:
At first, this is but a dream, I thought. Now, however, most clearly do I recall it. Twas The Amazing Nine-Tails who did open the Forbidden Chamber's door!
NOISE LEVEL60%
Apollo:
............ (I'm sorry I asked.)
Athena:
The Amazing Nine-Tails? But that was the victim, Alderman Kyubi, right?
Apollo:
Yeah. Why would he open the Forbidden Chamber? Wasn't he trying to keep it sealed?
Athena:
Never mind that! This is completely new information! Let me enter it and run an update!
Tenma:
Barely conscious was Damian there in the Forbidden Chamber.
Tenma:
Amid the darkness, a mighty statue of Tenma Taro loomed overhead.
Tenma:
Suddenly, the door did open, and a shaft of light did pierce the gloom!
Tenma:
The Amazing Nine-Tails had come to the rescue!
Pinpoint Sadness
Apollo:
Got it!
Leads to:
"When The Amazing Nine-Tails opened the chamber, banishing the darkness within..."
Athena:
What do you suppose The Amazing Nine-Tails was up to?
Apollo:
Good question. Could he have been trying to free the mayor from the Forbidden Chamber?
Athena:
But why help an enemy like that? Wasn't he opposed to the mayor's merger plan?
Apollo:
Hmm... Well, at least now we know why the room suddenly lit up.
Athena:
Must've been a huge relief for the mayor. I mean, just thinking about being trapped in that pitch-black room freaks me out.
Apollo:
When The Amazing Nine-Tails opened the chamber, banishing the darkness within... ...you felt joy, but didn't you also feel shock and sadness?
Tenma:
Hrmmm... Yes, in the hazy depths of my mind, I do recollect something of that nature. I believe it was the fiend's cape of red. For when I did behold it, a great wave of sadness did inexplicitly wash over me.
NOISE LEVEL20%
Apollo:
(A cape... of red?)
Athena:
Apollo! We've reduced the noise level! Oh, but there's still a little left.
Apollo:
Mayor Tenma, why were you sad when you saw the red cape?
Tenma:
Hrmmm... Why indeed...?
Apollo:
(What could this mean?)
Athena:
I guess his memory is still a little spotty. I know because his latest recollection contradicts the evidence.
Apollo:
Yeah, it's one of those contradictions that slaps you right across the face.
Athena:
Hmm... Something this obvious could arise... ...when someone is trying to force a fuzzy memory into a definitive shape. Apollo, I know what you have to do! You need to present evidence that contradicts the image you see!
Apollo:
Oh, so it's basically the same as the usual cross-examination process. (Okay, time to review the evidence. Look out contradiction, here comes Justice!)
Tenma:
Barely conscious was Damian there in the Forbidden Chamber.
Tenma:
Amid the darkness, a mighty statue of Tenma Taro loomed overhead.
Tenma:
Suddenly, the door did open, and a shaft of light did pierce the gloom!
Tenma:
The Amazing Nine-Tails had come to the rescue!
Present Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy
Apollo:
Leads to:
"You said The Amazing Nine-Tails's cape was red. Are you sure about that?"
Apollo:
It still seems like his memory is really confused.
Athena:
Yeah, that's because unlike data, memories are living, breathing things. Preconception, illusion, memory overlap, memory repression... Our memories are intimately tied to our psychology and emotions.
Apollo:
So, this contradiction is somehow caused by an emotion?
Athena:
I believe so. There's some deeper meaning here. Let's present some evidence. Maybe it will help jog his memory!
Apollo:
You said The Amazing Nine-Tails's cape was red. Are you sure about that?
Tenma:
Yes, well, I do believe it was a red cape I saw, but...
Apollo:
Mayor Tenma! Does this cape look red to you?!
Tenma:
Ohhhh! That certainly does NOT look red! Not even scarlet or crimson, either! Nevertheless! Upon my liberation something red did fill my as yet hazy field of view... ...and I thought to myself, "Ah! The Amazing Nine-Tails is arrayed in a cape of red!"
Apollo:
So, you mistook that red something for his cape, huh?
Tenma:
Apparently so. And remembering it now, brings a great sadness upon me.
Athena:
So the red something probably wasn't a cape after all. Maybe that great sadness he mentioned is what's interfering with his memory.
Apollo:
Well, he would've seen the Fox Chamber behind The Amazing Nine-Tails. What red object could he have seen there that would've been that shocking? Hmm... I know! Could it have been...! Mr. Mayor, was the red thing you saw this?

Foolish mortal! Do you mock me?!

Whoa! Sorry!
Tenma:
I'm afraid I have no recollection of seeing such an item. You must cease this practice of leaping before looking!
Apollo:
S-Sorry! Sorry! (Youch! That was a human/demon double punch!)
Athena:
Apollo, think of something that's red and could produce a feeling of sadness... And take a good look at the evidence again!
Leads back to:
"Mr. Mayor, was the red thing you saw this?"
Apollo:
Something red that could produce a deep sadness... Could it be, Mr. Tenma, that what you saw... was the alderman's blood?!
Tenma:
Blood?! Why, yes! It was blood! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! It's all coming back to me now! It wasn't a red cape that I saw... It was, lying behind The Amazing Nine-Tails, the alderman's bloody body!
Athena:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE
Athena:
His noise level is down to zero! I think he's remembered everything now.
Apollo:
Does this mean The Amazing Nine-Tails killed Alderman Kyubi?
Athena:
But the alderman WAS The Amazing Nine-Tails, so how exactly would that work?
Apollo:
Hey! I asked you first!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice, you sure know how to make a complicated matter even more complicated.
Apollo:
True, but at the time of the crime, out client was in the Forbidden Chamber. Moreover--
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
Hoy! Don't you think this strange? The little scamp has already confirmed her father to be in the Fox Chamber. But she said naught about seeing The Amazing Nine-Tails there.
Apollo:
Ack. (You just had to bring that up, didn't you...?)
Athena:
Jinxie didn't see L'Belle there, either. It's so weird. Who really was in that room, then?
Judge:
Would the defense care to share any theories with the court? Can you explain the inconsistency between the defendant's testimony and his daughter's?
Yes, I can
Apollo:
Yes, o-of course, I can explain it! (Because if I don't, we're in serious trouble!)
Leads to:
"Not with more of your bluffs and fairy tales, I trust?"
No, I can't
Apollo:
Explaining something like that would be completely--
Athena:
Athena:
Possible! My colleague here is going to explain it so it's crystal clear!
Apollo:
I am?!
Athena:
Even if you can't explain it, you can't let them know that! Just make something up!
Apollo:
(I don't hear YOU helping!)
Leads to:
"Not with more of your bluffs and fairy tales, I trust?"
Blackquill:
Not with more of your bluffs and fairy tales, I trust? Fair warning, Justice-dono. I shall have your head if you fail to explain this.
Apollo:
Eep! (What about a good old-fashion penalty?)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice, let's see if you have a head worth keeping on your shoulders.
Apollo:
First of all, Mr. L'Belle was definitely in the Fox Chamber while it was locked. We also know that Mayor Tenma was in the Forbidden Chamber based on his testimony. These two facts are crucial to my explanation. So, let us consider the following question. If the facts point to Florent L'Belle and the victim being there at the scene... ...why did Jinxie Tenma see her father Mayor Tenma and the victim?
Judge:
Hmm... A very good question, indeed. And I suppose you have an answer for us?
Apollo:
......... (Sadly, you would be supposing wrong...)
Athena:
Umm... You think she could've mistaken L'Belle for the mayor?
Apollo:
Well, if she did, then the question is, why did she do that?
Judge:
Well, how about that explanation, Mr. Justice? I believe the time for questions is over. The defense asserts that Florent L'Belle was at the scene of the crime. However, Jinxie Tenma has testified that she saw her father collapsed there. If she has, in fact, misremembered the event, what could've made her do so?
Jinxie was confused
Apollo:
Ms. Tenma was in a state of confusion at the time. That's how she mistook Mr. L'Belle for Mayor Tenma there in the Fox Chamber. After all, they both look kind of like yokai.
Judge:
I'm afraid I don't follow you, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
Um, can I have a do-over on that one?!
Leads back to:
"The defense asserts that Florent L'Belle was at the scene of the crime."
L'Belle was disguised as Tenma
Leads to:
"The figure Ms. Tenma saw was not her father."
She got the rooms mixed up
Apollo:
She only thought she was in the Fox Chamber because she got the rooms mixed up!
Judge:
Hmm... When I'm in a big rush, I may make an unintended detour or two through the building... ...but I never end up in the wrong courtroom!
Athena:
Even if she was confused, I think she'd notice if she entered the Forbidden Chamber. There is that massive barred door to deal with, after all.
Apollo:
Oh, right. Eh heh heh...
Judge:
A penalty for our spatially challenged attorney!
Apollo:
(Let's try that one again.)
Leads back to:
"The defense asserts that Florent L'Belle was at the scene of the crime."
Apollo:
The figure Ms. Tenma saw was not her father. It was Florent L'Belle disguised as Damian Tenma.
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
That is a complete impossibility. Their faces are utterly unalike. How could you explain that away with a mere disguise?
Judge:
Yes, they both DO have incredibly distinctive faces.
Apollo:
M-Maybe the disguise completely hid his face?
Athena:
I think Jinxie would've mentioned if she couldn't see her father's face.
Blackquill:
And if it was that sort of disguise, wouldn't she have removed it?
Apollo:
Oh, right...
Blackquill:
Your sword is as dull as your mind, Justice-dono. Shall I show you what a truly sharp blade is capable of?
Apollo:
Aha ha ha... I think I'll pass--ack! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!
Blackquill:
.........Hmph.
Athena:
Are you okay, Apollo?!
Apollo:
I'm... I'm... not fine, am I?
Blackquill:
Well, now that we have that little fairytale out of the way... Your Baldness, your verdict if you will.
Judge:
Mr. Justice, I believe it's time for a verdict if you have no further arguments.
Apollo:
Uhh... (What's even left for me to do?)
Athena:
Apollo! Remember what Mr. Wright always says? When you're stuck in a tight spot, turn the case upside down.
Apollo:
Turn the case upside down? Hmm... He does say that, doesn't he? But I don't quite see how it applies here. (Still, never hurts to give it a try, I guess. Let's see... Rather than "Jinxie didn't remove the disguise," maybe "she couldn't remove it." And rather than "she didn't tell anyone about the disguise"... maybe it was "she couldn't talk about it.")
Jinxie:
A wrestler's mask is more precious than his own life! He'd never unmask himself in front of others. But there ARE matches where wrestlers battle for the right to remove each other's masks. To have your mask torn off is the worst humiliation a wrestler could suffer! That's why their masks are more important to them than life itself.
Apollo:
(And what about the fact that it was The Amazing Nine-Tails who opened the door? A mask that can't be removed in front of others? Can these facts turn things around?) Ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! (We... We got it all backwards!)
Athena:
A-Apollo?
Apollo:
I think... I think we might've made a huge mistake.
Blackquill:
Your Baldness, I see no need to further indulge them in their silly little farce. The defense has no proof. They never did and they never will.
Judge:
Hmm... Then it seems I must announce my verdict--
Apollo:
Apollo:
I DO have proof!
Blackquill:
.........Do you, now?
Judge:
All right, but this better be good, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
We can solve the remaining riddles by turning all of our assumptions upside down. Why Jinxie Tenma mistook Mr. L'Belle for her father... ...why she couldn't remove the costume, or tell anyone about it in the first place... These riddles are inextricably linked to Mayor Tenma's secret identity! A shocking secret identity that will turn the entire premise of this case upside down! This piece of evidence clearly reveals Mayor Tenma's secret identity!
Present Amazing Nine-Tails Mask
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Gah! Wh-What absolute claptrap! Poppycock! Balderdash!"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Judge:
And that reveals the mayor's secret identity how exactly?
Apollo:
Isn't it obvious?
Judge:
No, it isn't.
Blackquill:
I, too, fail to see your point.
Apollo:
So, I guess we're all in the same boat, then.
Judge:
Mr. Justice! The only revelation here is your shocking desperation.
Apollo:
(Okay, time to find something that doesn't stink of desperation.)
Leads back to:
"These riddles are inextricably linked to Mayor Tenma's secret identity!"
Blackquill:
Gah! Wh-What absolute claptrap! Poppycock! Balderdash!
Apollo:
We thought the alderman was The Amazing Nine-Tails and the mayor was Tenma Taro. That's why we believed the mayor killed the alderman in his lust for Nine-Tails Vale. And it was the basis for the prosecution's entire case against our client. However... We got the whole thing backwards. Mayor Tenma wasn't Tenma Taro at all. He was The Amazing Nine-Tails!
Judge:
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What's thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis?!
Blackquill:
You... You'd best explain yourself, Justice-dono... And from where you derived such a farfetched conclusion!
Apollo:
Jinxie, no doubt, knew the true identity of The Amazing Nine-Tails. But she couldn't tell anyone no matter what. That's why she didn't say it was The Amazing Nine-Tails she saw passed out! Even though, unbeknownst to her, it was really Florent L'Belle in disguise!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
The accused and that deceitful dandy are utterly dissimilar in physical build and voice. The little scamp would have seen the difference!
Apollo:
Apollo:
Remember, Mr. L'Belle has his very own brand of cosmetics. Why couldn't he fake a different build, too? And anyone speaking through a mask would naturally sound different.
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
Why did she not simply pull the mask off?!
Apollo:
Apollo:
A masked wrestler's disguise is more precious than life itself. As a huge fan of The Amazing Nine-Tails, she would never dare unmask him!
Blackquill:
...Gah! Uuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Apollo:
This case of mistaken identity also explains the riddle of the locked room.
Judge:
Then by all means, Mr. Justice, answer it for us already!
Apollo:
First, Mr. L'Belle entered the room where the mayor and the alderman were talking. I suspect he brought with him coffee laced with some sort of sedative. Once the alderman was out cold... ...that's when Mr. L'Belle killed him! Next, he took the mayor, who he had also drugged, into the Forbidden Chamber. Then he returned to the Fox Chamber, slipped into some of the mayor's spare clothes... ...and completed the disguise by donning The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! With his entire charade in place, Mr. L'Belle then let out a scream... ...the scream that led Jinxie Tenma to the scene.
Athena:
Ah! So then... ...the person who said, "I killed Alderman Kyubi" was...
Apollo:
Yep, that was Florent L'Belle in disguise. The mayor never actually confessed.
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
Hmph. This is no more than guesswork and speculation. Now, stop your jabbering and--
Apollo:
Apollo:
No, you twisted samurai! This time, you stop your jabbering and let me finish making my case!
Blackquill:
Argh!
Apollo:
Once Ms. Tenma left the scene... ...Mr. L'Belle, still wearing the mayor's clothes and mask, opened the Forbidden Chamber... ...so he could drag the mayor back out into the Fox Chamber!
Athena:
Oh, so The Amazing Nine-Tails the mayor saw was...
Apollo:
Right, it was L'Belle opening the Forbidden Chamber. The second time Mr. L'Belle opened the door to the Forbidden Chamber... ...he happened to catch the thieving Mr. Filch by surprise. Startled, Mr. Filch in his Tenma Taro disguise ran as fast as he could away from the room. As he did, he left behind him a trail of feathers and tracks... ...and gave Ms. Tenma the scare of her life in the hallway. With no one left to witness the events that had occurred... ...Mr. L'Belle then proceeded to drag the sleeping mayor back into the Fox Chamber.
Judge:
I see. Well, that all certainly does make sense.
Apollo:
Then, after dragging the mayor back into the Fox Chamber... ...Mr. L'Belle threw the mask out the window and fled the room!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
For this absurd theory to work, it requires that the defendant be The Amazing Nine-Tails. However, he was the one pushing for the municipal merger. That such an individual could possibly be The Amazing Nine-Tails is preposterous!
Apollo:
Apollo:
The mayor was blackmailed into pursuing the merger! Ms. Tenma's life would've been in danger if he had openly voiced his opposition! That's why he created a secret identity as The Amazing Nine-Tails!
Blackquill:
Gah! This is madness! No one could possibly hatch such an insane plot!
Apollo:
No one except a killer as insane as his plot, and I'd say Florent L'Belle more than qualifies.
Tenma:
Foolish mortal! It is at your own peril that you forget who I am!
Apollo:
M-Mayor Tenma! It's okay now! Jinxie will be safe just as soon as Mr. L'Belle is arrested! You ARE The Amazing Nine-Tails, aren't you?!
Tenma:
I-I...! .........Hrmmmm.
L'Belle:
Apollo:
.........!
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! You have QUITE the active imagination! Mayor Tenma is NOT The Amazing Nine-Tails.
Apollo:
Apollo:
What do you mean?!
L'Belle:
WELL, has the mayor ADMITTED to it yet?
Apollo:
But that's just--
L'Belle:
And even if he DID admit to such nonsense... ...I would reveal the TRUTH behind Tenma Taro right here and now.
Apollo:
What?
Tenma:
Why you--! You would dare reveal the secret?!
L'Belle:
A ha ha ha! My GOOD FRIEND the alderman told me ALL about it. But it WOULDN'T be good to expose the truth, what with the superstitions, now would it?
Apollo:
(The truth behind Tenma Taro? What's he talking about?)
L'Belle:
So, go ahead, SAY it! Say, "I AM The Amazing Nine-Tails!" I DARE you!
Tenma:
Arrrrrrgh!
Apollo:
Apollo:
Wait! Will somebody please explain what's going on here?!
L'Belle:
Mayor Tenma will do ANYTHING to keep the truth behind Tenma Taro a secret. A dark, TERRIBLE truth that has been kept SECRET by the village superstitions.
Apollo:
And if the mayor admits to being The Amazing Nine-Tails, you'll expose the truth?
L'Belle:
Right! I WON'T have him walking free because of some NONSENSE you made up.
Blackquill:
.........Hmph. So, what now, Justice-dono? Without the mayor's admission, your theory is as useless as you are in battle.
Apollo:
(I'll show YOU who's useless!)
Athena:
Apollo! Don't you dare give up now!
Apollo:
I-I know, I know. Your Honor! I believe Mr. L'Belle's statements warrant a thorough cross-examination! After all, the true identity of The Amazing Nine-Tails is the cornerstone of this case!
Judge:
Hmm... You do have a point there. Please answer this court, Mr. L'Belle: Is the defendant The Amazing Nine-Tails or not?
Witness Testimony
-- The Amazing Nine-Tails's True Identity --
L'Belle:
The Amazing Nine-Tails's TRUE identity is NOT Mayor Tenma.
The mayor would NEVER admit to such UTTER nonsense.
But if he DID admit to such nonsense...
...I will EXPOSE the TRUTH behind Tenma Taro right here and now...
...and THAT would bring RUIN upon Nine-Tails Vale, just as the superstitions say.
Apollo:
Talk about out of the pot and into the fire... At this rate, the mayor will be found guilty for sure...
Judge:
Honestly speaking, if Mayor Damian Tenma is not The Amazing Nine-Tails... ...I'm afraid I don't see how the defense has much of a case here.
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! And LET'S just leave it at that, shall we? We ALL know Alderman Kyubi was The Amazing Nine-Tails, anyway. I mean, THAT'S how Nine-Tails Vale made a comeback -- the alderman was SO popular.
Apollo:
There's... gotta be a hole in that testimony somewhere... But I don't even know where to start.
Athena:
Since we don't have any proof that the mayor is The Amazing Nine-Tails... ...then we'll just have to get him to admit it himself.
Apollo:
But if he admits it, L'Belle's going to expose the secret behind Tenma Taro. (Argh! We are so close! I know it!)
Judge:
The defense may cross-examine the witness.

Yes, it's true. I would be SACRIFICED upon the altar of justice DESPITE my innocence. But what a TERRIBLE loss that would be for the FUTURE of humankind's cosmetic needs! It is a TRAGEDY that MUST be averted! Defend me if you UNDERSTAND this!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
The only terrible loss is the time wasted by your ceaseless yammering. If you would avert the tragedy awaiting you and that vexing visage of yours, then--
L'Belle:
Yes, yes, I know. Get on with my testimony. Anyhow, suffice to say... ...should the mayor ADMIT to the defense's nonsense, I will make good on my threat and...
L'Belle:
...I will EXPOSE the TRUTH behind Tenma Taro right here and now...
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
And just how did you learn of this so-called truth behind Tenma Taro?
L'Belle:
Alderman Kyubi told me all about it. The SECRET of the Forbidden Chamber AND the TRUTH behind Tenma Taro!
Apollo:
Why would he share a secret like that with you, Mr. L'Belle?
L'Belle:
Because of the alderman's wife. I was looking AFTER her while she was hospitalized. He appreciated it SO much, he shared the SECRETS with me.
Athena:
Wait, did he threaten the alderman in addition to the mayor?!
Apollo:
...Don't tell me THAT'S how he learned how to open the Forbidden Chamber.
L'Belle:
Needless to say, I'm NOT above revealing the TRUTH behind Tenma Taro...
L'Belle:
...and THAT would bring RUIN upon Nine-Tails Vale, just as the superstitions say.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Do not gaze upon Tenma Taro. Do not tell others if you see him. Isn't that what the village superstitions say?
L'Belle:
EXACTLY. Telling others what Tenma Taro LOOKS like would REVEAL the truth. THAT'S why the superstitions were written down in the first place.
Apollo:
And ruin coming to the village if you free him? Is that a warning not to expose the truth?
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! Bingo! And that truth is, Tenma Taro is a great, greed-inspiring fortune! That's what the whole battle over Nine-Tails Vale is all about!
Apollo:
(Tenma Taro is.. a great fortune? Come to think of it...)
Filch:
Eh heh heh. Only that it's the greatest get-rich-quick chance in the universe. Grandpappy told me all about it. Said there's an amazing treasure in there!
Apollo:
Could Tenma Taro actually be...
Mayor Tenma
Apollo:
Mayor Tenma just has to be Tenma Taro... right?
Athena:
Athena:
Please, Apollo! Stop messing around!
Apollo:
...Sorry.
Forbidden Chamber treasure
Leads to:
"(Telling the villagers that Tenma Taro is a terrifying yokai...)"
Apollo:
(Telling the villagers that Tenma Taro is a terrifying yokai... ...is what has scared them away from the Forbidden Chamber and the treasure within. That's how the treasure has been kept secret all this time!)
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! Well, well, well... It seems our ace attorney here has uncovered the truth that MUST NOT be revealed.
Apollo:
(Mayor Tenma looks like he wants to keep the truth hidden as much as I do...)
L'Belle:
TRAGEDY is DOOMED to repeat itself as long as Tenma Taro exists. THAT'S why the secret MUST BE protected!
Apollo:
......... (As long as Tenma Taro exists, huh...) Mr. L'Belle, please add that statement to your testimony!
Add statement:
"TRAGEDY is DOOMED to repeat as long as Tenma Taro exists."

So, in other words, tragedy wouldn't occur at all if there were no Tenma Taro?

Present Azuki Kozo Figure
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Mr. L'Belle, what if Tenma Taro no longer existed?"
Athena:
How's the mayor supposed to admit to his secret identity now?!
Apollo:
Well, we have to find a way to make him say it, or our entire case unravels. There must be a hole in L'Belle's testimony somewhere.
Apollo:
Mr. L'Belle, what if Tenma Taro no longer existed? Revealing the truth would no longer be an issue, would it?
L'Belle:
...If Tenma Taro no longer existed? Ah ha ha ha! What on EARTH are you talking about?
Apollo:
Oh, apparently you haven't heard. Tenma Taro no longer exists. But I guess you didn't get to do a thorough search after the key was taken from you... ...because when we searched the Forbidden Chamber, there wasn't any treasure there!
L'Belle:
Really? Well, MAYBE you weren't looking in the RIGHT place.
Apollo:
Sorry, but I have proof that Tenma Taro no longer exists. Take a look at this figure.
Judge:
What do we have here? It looks like some sort of creature.
Apollo:
We found this in the Forbidden Chamber. It's an Azuki Kozo figure. The great thief Azuki Kozo used to leave them at the scene of his crimes.
L'Belle:
Are YOU suggesting that... that Tenma Taro has been STOLEN?!
Apollo:
Yep. Phineas Filch's grandfather, a master thief, was the culprit.
L'Belle:
And by that hideous, moronic caretaker's grandfather, no less?! ...You! I-- Nooooooooooooooooooo! M-My beautiful golden, Tenma Taro was...!
Apollo:
The greed inspired by Tenma Taro can no longer bring ruin upon Nine-Tails Vale. Isn't that right, Mayor Tenma?
Tenma:
The root of tragedy would indeed seem to be gone. In fact, I now recall the alderman revealing the secret to me on the day of our meeting. He must have been speaking of Tenma Taro. For he said to me, the gold ingot was gone.
Apollo:
The gold ingot? You mean the treasure that is Tenma Taro's true form...?
Tenma:
Recall, if you will, the scroll in the Forbidden Chamber. Tenma Taro is the yellowish object shown there... ...a giant gold ingot that my nomadic ancestors bestowed upon Nine-Tales [sic] Vale. In return for that gold, my ancestors did receive from Nine-Tails Vale... ...land that would become Tenma Town. But drive the villagers mad with greed did that great fortune! Bitter was their greed-fueled battle. It was as if they were possessed. My ancestor's gold became as a curse upon their village -- a curse of ruin. Thus it was that the yokai Tenma Taro came to be.
Apollo:
So, Tenma Taro and the village superstitions were merely fairytales to scare people away.
Blackquill:
...Hmph. Fairytale or not, Tenma Taro made quite the mess of things.
Tenma:
Yes, indeed, for there is no greater monster than a mortal man's lust for gold.
Athena:
Well, you know what they say, "The love of money is the root of all evil."
Tenma:
My ancestors did bring a terrible thing here to Nine-Tails Vale. A thing so terrible that... ...Tenma Taro, a monster just as terrible, had to be created to keep it a secret. Yet we have naught but love for the little village to which we owe our very existence. Tenma Town would never seek to take over Nine-Tails Vale in a merger!
Judge:
Oh my. That was quite a shocking lesson in history.
Apollo:
Mr. Mayor. Now that we know Tenma Taro no longer exists... ...are you ready to admit YOUR secret? You ARE The Amazing Nine-Tails, aren't you?!
L'Belle:
L'Belle:
Noooo! Don't do it! Please, nooooooooooooooooooo!
Tenma:
Be gone, you demented demon! Ahem. Now, where was I... The golden lord of yokai, The Amazing Nine-Tails is, indeed, me! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
And that means...! Jinxie!
Jinxie:
.........Y-Yes?!
Apollo:
The man wearing the mayor's clothes who you saw collapsed in the Fox Chamber... Was he wearing The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask?
Jinxie:
...Uh-huh. That's what made me think it was Papa. He said he was going to reveal his secret identity to Alderman Kyubi that day, so... So... it wasn't really Papa I saw there, was it?
Tenma:
It was Florent's idea from the start. He advised me to reveal my secret identity to the alderman.
Apollo:
(Yeesh, Rube Goldberg machines have less elaborate setups than L'Belle's scheme...)
Tenma:
You may rest easy now, Jinxie. That monster's deception is through! Caw caw-caw-caw!
Apollo:
The true facts behind this case have finally come to light! Mayor Tenma did not kill Alderman Kyubi! But Florent L'Belle DID!
L'Belle:
How... dare you... PEASANT! Gnrk! Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
...............Hmph! Justice-dono... You should at least have a real blade in your hands if you desire to cross swords with me. Or have you mistaken this battlefield for a training ground?
Apollo:
...! (What's this guy want now?!)
Blackquill:
Evidence is like a razor-sharp blade that cuts through bone as though it were butter. But you have only blind guesses -- a dull blade incapable of cutting even a cake.
Judge:
He has you there, Mr. Justice. After all, evidence is everything in a court of law.
Apollo:
B-B-But!
L'Belle:
They're right! Let's see some EVIDENCE! Of course, a PERFECT being like me wouldn't leave ANY incriminating evidence behind. Ah ha ha ha!
Blackquill:
This is the final battle. Just as a samurai must live and die by the sword... ...you will live or die by the evidence you hold. My swift blade of judgment awaits. Now, present your conclusive evidence, or don't you have any?
Apollo:
(Oh, crud... Do I have anything conclusive?)
Of course I do
Apollo:
Evidence? Oh, I have evidence!
Athena:
Y-You do?
Apollo:
Of course! It's just the conclusive evidence we need, too! (I'm going to finally prove Mayor Tenma innocent! Here comes Justice!)
Leads to:
"Let's review the facts."
Nope
Apollo:
(Ugh. I can't think of anything. But there has to be some kind of evidence I can present.)
Athena:
Don't give up now, Apollo! Let's try reviewing the case again.
Apollo:
I'm... I'm... I'm......... ...I'M FINE, I'M FINE, I'M FINE, I'M FINE! (She's right. I can't give up now. This whole trial would've been for nothing! I know there has to be some conclusive evidence somewhere!)
Leads to:
"Let's review the facts."
Apollo:
Let's review the facts. The most damning evidence against the mayor was the crime scene itself. The mayor and the victim were the only two people found in the room. Also, we all though [sic] the alderman was killed because he was The Amazing Nine-Tails. But as we know now, of course, we were way off. The Amazing Nine-Tails is really Mayor Damian Tenma! That's why when his daughter Jinxie saw The Amazing Nine-Tails collapsed at the scene... ...she mistook him for her father. Those are the facts we have revealed. However, Mr. L'Belle asserts that he did not leave any evidence at the scene of the crime. But he didn't say anything about evidence outside the crime scene. Maybe he isn't as clever as he thinks he is! Does any of the evidence found outside the crime scene provide any clues?
Hand Cream
Apollo:
No, that's not it. The hand cream had Phineas Filch's prints on it... ...because Filch had stolen it from L'Belle. That's not going to help us nab the real killer, though. Maybe I should study the evidence again.
Leads back to:
"Does any of the evidence found outside the crime scene provide any clues?"
Amazing Nine-Tails Mask
Leads to:
"A clue inside the mask?"
A clue inside the mask?
Apollo:
Oh, I know. The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! It was found washed up along the river. What sort of clue does that mask hold?
White hair
Leads to:
"White hair in the mask"
Patch of golden fur
Apollo:
The patch of golden animal fur... It was found caught in the window at the crime scene. Oh, but that's evidence from inside the Fox Chamber. I should be thinking about evidence that was found outside of the crime scene right now.
Leads back to:
"What sort of clue does that mask hold?"
White hair in the mask
Apollo:
And what about the hair left in the mask? Who does it belong to?
Rex Kyubi
Apollo:
The hair in the mask belonged to the alderman. So, the true identity of The Amazing Nine-Tails is... the alderman? No, of course it isn't! What am I thinking?! Someone had been wearing that mask at the crime scene. That's what I should focus on! Let's think about that again.
Leads back to:
"And what about the hair left in the mask? Who does it belong to?"
Florent L'Belle
Leads to:
"THE WHITE HAIR IS L'BELLE'S"
THE WHITE HAIR IS L'BELLE'S
Apollo:
Oh, right! That hair is Florent L'Belle's! Yes! Now that's what I call conclusive evidence!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? Do you have any conclusive evidence to present to this court?
Apollo:
Of course, I do! Observe this mask, if you will.
Judge:
That mask? How is that conclusive evidence?
Apollo:
It's not the mask itself, but the white hair inside it. We originally thought it belonged to Alderman Rex Kyubi.
Judge:
Yes, but The Amazing Nine-Tails, as we now know, is Mayor Tenma, so...
Apollo:
That is correct. So, the question is, whose hair could this be? And the answer to that is the last person to have worn it before it was discarded. That would be you, Mr. Florent L'Belle!
L'Belle:
What ARE you talking about?! I NEVER had hideous white hair like that!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
It would appear your coup de grÃ¢ce failed to hit its mark. This freakish fop is not the white-hair type. Because he's busy being one ludicrously garish color or another.
Apollo:
Apollo:
No, Prosecutor Blackquill, it's you who has made a fatal error.
Blackquill:
Wh-What?
Apollo:
Remember where this mask was found? Washed up by the side of the river? With that in mind... This last piece of evidence will solve all of the remaining riddles!
Present Couleur Me L'Belle!
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Argh! Th-That's...!"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Judge:
That's your conclusive evidence?
Apollo:
That's right. It solves all of the riddles that have been plaguing this case!
Athena:
Apollo! You're presenting the wrong piece of evidence.
Apollo:
Oops. (What a place to slip up...!)
Athena:
Think about L'Belle's real hair color. Given what it is, there's only one piece of evidence that really stands out in this case!
Apollo:
I-I know! But in my case, I've got a case of the end-of-case jitters! Sorry, Your Honor. I was way off on that one.
Judge:
That was an eleventh-hour blunder, and it clearly reveals your attention deficiency. A penalty for our attention-deficient lawyer!
Apollo:
(I'm gonna nail it next time. You'll see.)
Leads back to:
"This last piece of evidence will solve all of the remaining riddles!"
L'Belle:
Argh! Th-That's...!
Judge:
Hm? What is that?
Apollo:
This is Mr. L'Belle's own private brand of hair color. It washes out with just water. The court will also recall that The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask... ...washed up along the side of the village river with white hair inside it.
Blackquill:
What's this?! Are you saying that preening peacock's hair color is...?!
Apollo:
That's exactly what I'm saying. Mr. L'Belle's hair color is a freaky work of fiction. But thanks to the river flowing through Nine-Tails Vale, we now have a real life exposÃ©.
L'Belle:
Aaah!
Apollo:
The white hair in this mask is conclusive evidence proving you're the real killer! A DNA test is all we need to prove it, and we both know we'll get a match! Admit it! Florent L'Belle, you were the one who killed Alderman Rex Kyubi!
L'Belle:
Y-You... You......... Peasant... How DARE yooooooooooooooooou! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! You profane MY beauty, like a bug on a roooooooooose. I'm going to exterminate you, like I did the aldermaaaaaaaaaaaaaan! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! N-Noooooooooooooo! M-M-My makeuuuuuup!
L'Belle:
............... ............... Hello, this is L'Belle! ...What? The project... is off? This is L'Belle! ...The sponsors have pulled out? L'Belle speaking! ...I'm fired? You mean I'm no longer Mayor Tenma's aide?! Hello, this is L'Belle! ...What? There's a stratospheric damages claim against me? ...One hundred m-m-million dollars? Heh heh heh. Hee hee hee! Ah ha ha ha ha! I'm FINISHED, WASHED UP! Stick a fork in me, I'm DOOOOOOOOOONE! A-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! A-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Blackquill:
...This is preposterous. I, Simon Blackquill, defeated?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order in the court!!!
Judge:
Well...! This is quite the unexpected outcome. I must hand it to you, Mr. Justice... ...you really turned this case on its head, just like that other lawyer, Phoenix Wright.
Apollo:
Ha ha ha. (Wait, that was a compliment, right?)
Judge:
Prosecutor Blackquill, what have you done with Florent L'Belle?
Blackquill:
The defaced man has withered like a flower without water. One of the officers is currently tending to him with a sprinkler.
Apollo:
(Um, wouldn't that just wash even MORE of his makeup off?)
Blackquill:
Allow me to explain the actions of the guilty party in detail. The motive, of course, was to steal the gold ingot known as "Tenma Taro." However, few are allowed into the manor due to its cultural ties to Nine-Tails Vale. L'Belle set in motion plans to gain access to the manor and the gold within via the merger. But the efforts of The Amazing Nine Tails saw those plans come to a halt. And thus, L'Belle murdered the alderman and attempted to pin the blame on Mayor Tenma.
Judge:
I see. But what I still can't comprehend is why would he go after the gold in the first place? Mr. L'Belle doesn't look like someone who is in need of financial aid.
Blackquill:
L'Belle hid his past well, much like he hid his "beauty" with makeup. He's mired in debt. Debt due to pouring money into a brand only he could love... ...which is why he sought the gold with such voracity.
Apollo:
(Too bad for him, someone else had gotten to it first anyway.)
Judge:
I see. Very well, then. I believe it's time I declared a verdict. This court finds the defendant, Damian Tenma...
Not Guilty
Judge:
Court is adjourned!
April 19, 1:23 PMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3
Phoenix:
That was some seriously good lawyering, Apollo. Even I didn't see that coming.
Apollo:
Heh heh. Just got lucky, I guess.
Phoenix:
You banished Tenma Taro from Nine-Tails Vale like you were some kind of exorcist.
Athena:
...Um, there's one thing I still don't understand. How come Mr. L'Belle didn't kill Mayor Tenma, too? He could've set it up so the mayor murdered the alderman, then died from a counterattack. That would've removed at least one possible fly from the ointment.
Phoenix:
I was wondering about that, too. But I have a hunch L'Belle was biding his time. He was planning on exposing The Amazing Nine-Tails's true identity himself.
Apollo:
Huh? But why?
Phoenix:
Because the mayor was The Amazing Nine-Tails. Had L'Belle succeeded in framing Mayor Tenma for the alderman's murder... ...the wrestler's popularity would've plummeted once his identity was revealed.
Apollo:
Oh, I get it! If The Amazing Nine-Tails was just killed, he'd die a hero. But if he was proved a villain... ...his fans would abandon him, making the merger that much easier.
Phoenix:
Right. Then when the merger was complete and everything cooled down... He'd be able to search the Forbidden Chamber at his leisure.
Athena:
What an insanely intricate plot.
Tenma:
Caw caw-caw-caw! A most excellent job clearing my name! A feat worthy of the demon lord's approval!
Apollo:
Um, why are you acting like Tenma Taro again?
Tenma:
Let this be of no concern to you!
Apollo:
(How could it not concern me?!)
Jinxie:
Tenma Taro, be gone!
Tenma:
Gaaaaah! J-Jinxie... Seems like ages since I've laid eyes on you.
Jinxie:
Papa! You're finally back!
Tenma:
Yes, it would seem Tenma Taro is no match for you. Ha ha ha!
Jinxie:
I'm not scared of that silly yokai anymore!
Athena:
Your father's a free man now, Jinxie! Isn't that great?!
Jinxie:
Thank you for all you've done! Seeing you guys in action, it... ...it made me feel like I don't have to be afraid anymore.
Apollo:
(Wait, is Jinxie actually... smiling?!)
Tenma:
This is all thanks to you two. Too bad The Amazing Nine-Tails will have to retire, though.
Athena:
Aww, how come?!
Tenma:
Once everyone hears I'm The Amazing Nine-Tails, my fan base will nosedive. After all, I'm not the most popular of people -- another reason for my secret identity. I don't see how I could possibly continue.
Athena:
Hee hee, I think you've misjudged yourself. Take a look outside!
Tenma:
Say, now that you mention it, what's all that noise out there?
Apollo:
A big crowd gathered outside the courthouse once the news broke. Seems they want to get a glimpse of Mayor Damian Tenma, the man behind the mask. And to root for your return to the wrestling ring!
Tenma:
Rooting? For me? But I thought I was nothing more than a malefactor in their eyes.
Athena:
The only one who really matters is Jinxie. Show her how cool you really are!
Jinxie:
Yeah, you're the coolest when you're out there fighting in the ring, Papa!
Tenma:
Jinxie...
Apollo:
Here, I think you'll be needing this.

Apollo:

"Thank you. Now, if you would excuse me."

Why would I need this?
Apollo:
Because if you wear it, your fans will come flocking to see you in action!
Athena:
Apollo! That's not what you're supposed to return to him!
Apollo:
Huh? ...Oh, right! (Could I have been any less cool?!)
Athena:
This is what we have to give back to Mayor Tenma!
Apollo:
Oh, right, The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask. Here you go, sir!
Leads to:
"Thank you. Now, if you would excuse me."
Tenma:
Thank you. Now, if you would excuse me.
Apollo:
Hm?
Tenma:
I don't want to keep my fans waiting!

Tenma:
Nine-Tails Vale, forever!
Crowd:
Nine-Tails! Nine-Tails! Nine-Tails! Nine-Tails! Nine-Tails!
Athena:
I sure hope they can settle the problems between Tenma Town and Nine-Tails Vale.
Apollo:
Me, too.
Phoenix:
I'm sure they'll be fine. After all... ...the blackmailer-slash-killer is behind bars and the merger's no longer an issue. Plus, The Amazing Nine-Tails is obviously still a hit, and I suspect Nine-Tails Vale will be too.
Apollo:
And it's all because we believed in our client, just like you said.
Athena:
Okay, people. Now that we've got that one in the bag, let's go get something to eat! I'm starving!
Apollo:
Sounds good. I've been so nervous I haven't eaten since yesterday.
Athena:
Better keep eating, Apollo! Or you might have to start looking up at me!
Apollo:
Huh? I'm definitely past my growth phase, and you should be about past yours, too!
Athena:
Are you kidding me? I'm just getting started! Ready or not... it's face-stuffing time!
Apollo:
Keep eating like that and the only direction you'll grow is sideways.
Athena:
Very funny! But I've got a hollow leg! I can eat as much as I want without gaining an ounce!
Apollo:
Really? Wow, I can't wait to see this.
Athena:
Calories? Ha! Just let 'em try to stick on me!
Phoenix:
All right, already, you two. Let's get going before the old man closes shop. Eldoon's Noodles isn't an all-night stand, you know.
Apollo:
I'm with Mr. Wright! Let's go!
Athena:
I've been waiting to have a bowl from there ever since Mr. Wright told me about them! Well, what are we waiting for?!
Phoenix:
The noodles are on me today, so I expect some serious eating from you two.
Athena:
Yay! Thanks, Boss! I won't let you down!
Apollo:
(Athena has no idea what she's getting into. Mr. Eldoon's noodles are so hot and salty... ...two bowls would kill a man.)
Athena:
That was our first case together, and it felt like nothing could bring us down after that. The dark age of the law seemed so distant, so irrelevant to our small, cozy office... But little did I know that it had been lurking all along, right there behind us. The first time it made itself known was during the murder at Themis Legal Academy. That case would mark the twilight before the dark, cold night that was to come.

Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Apollo:
That statement clearly contradicts the evidence!
Blackquill:
...Hmph. I object to you on personal grounds. The sole contradiction lies in what your faulty logic dreamt up just now.
Apollo:
Ack!
Judge:
Objection overruled. The defense will think twice before making such erroneous statements!
Apollo:
(It seems that statement didn't particularly conflict with the evidence.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Apollo:
Consider the evidence. There's obviously something wrong with that statement!
Blackquill:
Your gall knows no bounds. It's shocking, really.
Apollo:
What's that supposed to mean?!
Blackquill:
You stand there, brazenly objecting to perfectly factual statements... One does not see such shameless behavior that often.
Judge:
A penalty for our shameless attorney!
Apollo:
(Oh, no. Looks like Blackquill is turning the judge against me.)

Apollo:
Apollo:
The evidence is at complete odds with the witness's testimony!
Blackquill:

Judge:
Wh-Who, me?
Blackquill:
What do you make of this objection of his?
Judge:
Oh, I don't know if I should, um, well...
Blackquill:
I've no patience for vagaries. Now, answer my question.
Judge:
Y-Yes, sir! The defense's objection was clearly misguided!
Blackquill:
Bravo. Nicely done.
Judge:
Ho ho ho. It seems our misguided attorney has earned himself a penalty.
Apollo:
(Erk... I better look before I leap next time!)
Consult (when evidence must be presented)
Athena:
Hmm... There has to be a contradiction here somewhere. 
Apollo:
(Too bad I'm drawing a blank.)
Athena:
There was a statement that I thought was a little strange, but... ...I wouldn't bet my life on it.
Apollo:
.........And which statement would that be? Since I'm the one betting my life on it.
Athena:
Hee hee hee. Okay, if you must know, I'll show you the one I'm thinking of.
Apollo:
(Time to swallow my pride and let her lend a hand. There must be an inconsistency in the testimony Athena's pointing out!)
Consult (when statements must be pressed)
Athena:
Hmm... I can't flag any inconsistencies.
Apollo:
So there haven't been any contradictions in the testimony so far... That can mean only one thing...
Athena:
Time to press the witness!
Apollo:
Right. We'll have to work to get the testimony we need. Let's press the heck out of any statements that stick out.
Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment "The Ruler of Demonkind")
Apollo:
Got it!
Apollo:
The unexpected emotion is right... here.
Athena:
Really? You sure about that?
Apollo:
Yeah, can't you see it? Maybe if you look really hard? Just keep staring, and maybe--
Athena:
Apollo, this isn't a game of "Where's Emo"...
Apollo:
So, I'm way off?
Athena:
At least make an effort next time!
Apollo:
Okay, okay. Let me try that again.

Apollo:
Apollo:
Mayor Tenma, your recollection contradicts this piece of evidence!
Tenma:
Hrmm? Where is this contradiction of which you speak?
Apollo:
(Oops, looks like I got that one wrong.) 
Judge:
The contradiction-challenged Mr. Justice just earned himself a penalty.
Athena:
Time to compare the testimony and evidence again.
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's argument is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Damian Tenma...
Guilty
