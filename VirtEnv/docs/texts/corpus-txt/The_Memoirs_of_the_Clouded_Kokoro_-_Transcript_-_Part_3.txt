Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy
Ryunosuke:
Whew. We made it back in one piece...just. To be perfectly honest, I thought we were finished there for a while.
Susato:
Oh, I know. What a lot of close shaves. There are so many carriages on the streets of London, you were very nearly flattened several times.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...no...I didn't mean that.
Susato:
Yes, I know. It was a marvellous defence, Naruhodo-san, it really was. I was in awe of you!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um...thank you.
Susato:
And now that your fervent exploits have won us some more precious investigation time... ...let's see if we can't find some new clues for court tomorrow!
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Let's do that! .........
Susato:
Everything alright?
Ryunosuke:
I suppose...I still can't quite believe it, that's all. That I'm here in England working as a lawyer, I mean. In the Old Bailey, no less.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(The truth is, it shouldn't be me, should it? It should be him standing in my shoes. It should be Kazuma.)
Susato:
...It was Kazuma-sama's wish that you follow him to Great Britain and work alongside him.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. I mean, I never had the chance to ask him exactly why, but...he clearly had a plan. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him.
Susato:
And you're doing wonderfully, Naruhodo-san! I've no doubt that Kazuma-sama would say exactly the same if he were here with us.
Ryunosuke:
...Thank you, Susato-san. Thank you.

Today's trial
Ryunosuke:
It was quite a shock earlier today, wasn't it? When the victim himself turned up in court and took the stand.
Susato:
I know...
Ryunosuke:
Not only that, but then finding out that he is actually a barefaced gas thief as well!
Susato:
Yes...that was certainly a surprise to us all. For a while, it seemed as though everyone had quite forgotten about Soseki-san poisoning the tea.
Ryunosuke:
Careful of your phrasing, Susato-san! He didn't poison anything! (And there's more to this Mr Shamspeare than we yet know, I'm sure of it...)
Susato:
Mr Shamspeare certainly wasn't the noble, upstanding man everyone thought he was at first.
Ryunosuke:
What's become of him, actually?
Susato:
I was told that he'd be returning to the hospital ward where he was receiving treatment.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, which one is that?
Susato:
Let me see... Ah yes, he's at St Bartholomew's. Or Barts as Londoners call it.
Ryunosuke:
We know that place, don't we?
Susato:
Yes, we visited Miss Green there yesterday. It's the same hospital to which she was taken.
Ryunosuke:
Ah yes, after Soseki-san stabbed her in the back.
Susato:
Do be careful of your phrasing, Naruhodo-san! He didn't stab anyone!
Ryunosuke:
...Perhaps we both owe Soseki-san an apology. (St Bartholomew's... Yes, we should probably visit the hospital later.)
What next?
Ryunosuke:
So...we know that Soseki-san took tea to the victim on the night in question. But as he isn't the culprit, then obviously...
Susato:
Yes. The poison surely wasn't in the tea.
Ryunosuke:
But if that's the case... (...how on earth did the poison get into Mr Shamspeare's body?)
Susato:
I'm sure we'll find a clue at the scene. There must be something in Mr Shamspeare's room that will help solve the mystery.
Ryunosuke:
Well, naturally Scotland Yard detectives have been over the place already. But it couldn't hurt for us to have another look around, I think.
Susato:
Definitely! And I'm desperate to know the outcome of the investigation into the tea left in the bar of soap.
Ryunosuke:
(Well, if we run into Inspector Gregson, we could ask him about that.)
Kazuma's wishes
Ryunosuke:
(Kazuma Asogi... The best friend I ever had... And a lawyer with such promise. He really saved my bacon in that horrible incident just before we left Japan. I can still picture him now, looking so fierce and determined in court. And then after the trial, that crazy idea he came up with...)
Ryunosuke:
As a stowaway?!
Kazuma:
Yes, you can fit inside my trunk if you curl up small enough, I'm sure. No one will know.
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma...won't you tell me why? Why go to these lengths so that I can accompany you to Great Britain?
Kazuma:
Well, it's been on my mind ever since we got through that trial. That you really ought to go into law. Be a defence lawyer. You've got a natural talent for it. Believe me. I guarantee it.
Ryunosuke:
But I've never even thought about becoming a lawyer.
Kazuma:
Well...I can't force you, obviously. You'll have to decide for yourself. But anyway, London is the cultural capital of the world. The city at the forefront of everything. It can't hurt for you to see it with your own eyes.
Ryunosuke:
No, that's true.
Kazuma:
I suppose, though... ...if you were to become a lawyer, then one day... .........
Ryunosuke:
One day what?
Kazuma:
...Oh, no, never mind.
Ryunosuke:
...?
Susato:
Naruhodo-san?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, sorry. I was just thinking about Kazuma.
Susato:
Yes... He's forever in my thoughts, too. To change the Japanese judicial system for the better... That was his dream. And that's why he so desperately wanted to come to Great Britain to study, of course.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's right. But...
Susato:
...? Yes?
Ryunosuke:
I do wonder if his true intentions lay elsewhere sometimes. I don't know. The thought just takes hold of me every now and then, that's all.
Kazuma's true intentions (appears after "Kazuma's wishes")
Susato:
Naruhodo-san, what do you mean by Kazuma-sama's 'true intentions'?
Ryunosuke:
......... I mean this.
Susato:
...His katana?
Ryunosuke:
I never expected to inherit this sword after Kazuma passed away of course.
Susato:
No, I know. It was because I asked you to take it...
Ryunosuke:
When I have it at my side in court, I feel as though...it gives me courage.
Susato:
Yes...
Ryunosuke:
Actually, the night before he died, he told me a little about the sword.
Ryunosuke:
...'Karuma'?
Kazuma:
That's right. It's a prized sword that's been passed down through generations of the Asogi clan. A Japanese man's sword is his soul, Ryunosuke. I can't be parted from my katana. Karuma guides me. I truly believe that.
Ryunosuke:
So its name compels its wielder to slice evil in two? Not that you would need much compelling...
Kazuma:
On that subject... ...there's something very important that I have to do in Great Britain.
Ryunosuke:
Something you have to do?
Kazuma:
...Yes. I'd appreciate you seeing it through with me.
Ryunosuke:
Of, of course I will. Whatever it is, I'll see it through to the end with you.
Kazuma:
...I knew you wouldn't let me down.
Susato:
What did he mean by 'something very important that I have to do'?
Ryunosuke:
I had hoped that the answer to that question would become apparent when we arrived here, but... ...as yet I've not found a single clue.
Susato:
I see...
Present
Gas Meter
Susato:
Unless you put coins in this meter, of course, it won't give you any gas.
Ryunosuke:
The British have some really chilling inventions, don't they?
Susato:
Sorry?
Ryunosuke:
Well, you could die on a cold winter's night if you weren't able to light your stove.
Susato:
I suppose in a way, one little coin could be the difference between life and death...
Ryunosuke:
Personally, I'd break the meter and find a way to light the stove somehow.
Susato:
Oh no! The meter might explode if you were to tamper with it, Naruhodo-san!
Ryunosuke:
......... The gas companies have it all buttoned up, don't they?
22nd February
Mr and Mrs Garrideb's Room
Susato:
Mr Garrideb appears to be out.
Ryunosuke:
Hm, oh well. I suppose we'll just have to come back again later.
Examine
Anything
Ryunosuke:
(...We probably shouldn't poke around in here whilst Mr Garrideb is out...)
22nd February
St Bartholomew's Hospital, Recovery Ward
Susato:
...What do you suppose is happening? It sounds like some sort of disturbance...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I hear angry voices...
Shamspeare:
Be not angry, o ample lady! Verily, thou art mistaken.
Green:
Mistaken, my foot! You were looking! You were looking at my painting!
Shamspeare:
'The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen...' 'Twas foul indeed, the poison that moustached villain gaveth me! Forgive me, lady!
Green:
I wish that you'd died from that poison!
Shamspeare:
God-a-mercy, ample lady! But thou seest, I have vigour still! Behold, my Shamspeare dance!
Susato:
...This looks rather ominous, doesn't it?
Shamspeare:
Ah... Lo, 'tis the lawyer from the land whence riseth the sun! How now?
Ryunosuke:
Um, what are you doing here, Mr Shamspeare?
Shamspeare:
Marry, I do believe I am return'd unto another ward!
Green:
He was looking, that's what he was doing! Looking at my terrible work!
Shamspeare:
......... Eastern fellow, so dark yclad... ...faith, thy work in court this morning was wonderful. I do applaud thee!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, well...thank you.
Shamspeare:
But! That doesn't mean things will go so wonderfully for you tomorrow, does it?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Shamspeare:
...Anon, exeunt!
Ryunosuke:
(Mr Shamspeare might technically be the victim in this case... ...but there's definitely a lot more to it than that. It's very hard to pin the man down.)
Green:
I'm so sorry. I'm such an awful person.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, Miss Green. Is everything alright?
Green:
Oh...yes...I mean, don't worry about me. They're about to discharge me, so...I must get ready to leave now.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see.
Susato:
We're delighted that you'll soon be well enough to go home, Miss Green.
Green:
Oh dear, you're too kind. I, I don't deserve it.
Examine
Olive Green
Ryunosuke:
So, are you feeling more like yourself today, Miss Green?
Green:
I am. ...Thank you. I mean, people do recover from ordeals like this, don't they? Even people like me...
Ryunosuke:
Well, yes...it really was an ordeal, wasn't it?
Green:
As far as I'm concerned, I was just walking along in the snow one evening, minding my own business. And then, completely out of the blue, I was struck in the back by a knife and collapsed unconscious for days. Of course, when I finally woke up again yesterday, the whole business had been cleared up already.
Susato:
What a terrible week it's been for you.
Green:
Oh no. I'm sure I'm very lucky, really. I'll look back on this fondly.
Ryunosuke:
(Really?)
Green:
Anyway, I must be getting my things together now so I'm ready to be discharged.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes, of course. Sorry to take up your time when you're obviously busy.
22nd February
Sholmes's Suite
Iris:
Oh, Runo! And Susie! Hurray! You're back!
Susato:
Hello, Iris. You're in fine spirits as always, I see.
Iris:
I am! And you look as immaculately presented as ever, Susie!
Susato:
Oh! You flatter me!
Iris:
Well, you couldn't have come at a better time! I've just made a pot of tea. I'll set some cups.
Ryunosuke:
Really? Thanks, Iris. (But actually... ...what is that foul smell?)
Sholmes:
Ah-ha! The wanderers return at last! Where on earth have the pair of you been?
Ryunosuke:
Um...we've been in court?
Sholmes:
Oh! For Mr Moustache's case? That was today, was it?
Susato:
I'm sure I mentioned it only yesterday, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
I'm sure you think you did. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! ...Well, we can laugh about it now! So tell me...how did the trial go?
Ryunosuke:
Reasonably well so far. We've managed to escape without a guilty verdict at least.
Sholmes:
Really? I would have liked to see it. And I must pass the time of day with Mr Reaper again. It's been too long.
Ryunosuke:
Is Lord van Zieks an acquaintance, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Naturally. There's not a person in the world who doesn't know my name, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
(Not quite what I asked, but still...)
Susato:
Mr Sholmes...whatever is that odour?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, what is it? It's faint, but...absolutely awful!
Sholmes:
Ah, indeed! That's the scent of victory, my dear fellows! Victory in science!
Susato:
Oh dear...
Ryunosuke:
(Alright, I'll bite. What's he up to now...?)
Converse
Lord van Zieks
Sholmes:
Lord Barok van Zieks... Yes, it's an interesting sobriquet he has, isn't it? The Reaper of the Bailey. Once the legendary prosecutor has fought for someone's conviction, that person is doomed. Even if he or she is found not guilty by the courts, sooner or later the hapless soul will vanish from the capital.
Ryunosuke:
But vanish how exactly?
Sholmes:
By falling under a passing carriage, or drowning in the Thames... ...or succumbing to a sudden fever, or, quite out of the blue, being set upon by a highwayman. There are numerous routes to one's final terminus, my dear fellow.
Ryunosuke:
...It all seems a little far-fetched, really.
Sholmes:
Well, on the bright side, Mr Moustache is fighting fit...for the time being, at least.
Ryunosuke:
...That's not overly reassuring.
Susato:
If the rumours are true, though, the obvious conclusion... ...would surely be that those acquitted are, well...by Lord van Zieks's own hand...
Sholmes:
As it happens, Miss Susato, that is quite impossible.
Susato:
Oh? Why?
Sholmes:
Naturally, the man very quickly came under such suspicion. However, whenever these incidents occurred, the Reaper always had a cast-iron alibi.
Ryunosuke:
R-Really?
Sholmes:
And so his reign continued. But five years ago... ...he vanished from the courts, never to appear as a prosecutor again. That is, until you arrived in the country, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, so I've heard. (In fact, it was the very day I arrived, when I was thrust into that trial at the Old Bailey. That bitter fight to the death coincided with the Reaper's resurrection... ...and really did end bitterly indeed.)
Sholmes:
And here you are, facing Mr Reaper again.
Iris:
Poor Runo. I don't know if you're just incredibly unlucky... ...or incredibly unlikeable.
Ryunosuke:
I, I think it goes deeper than just me. I sense a general loathing... ...of all Japanese people.
Iris:
...!
Foul smell
Ryunosuke:
So...what is that...indescribably foul smell?
Sholmes:
Ah, well... Most probably this, I would say.
Ryunosuke:
...What is that?
Sholmes:
My dear fellow! It is, of course, my latest invention! A chemical test that can identify whether or not a tea is genuine at the drop of...some tea.
Susato:
Oh my!
Sholmes:
There are some unscrupulous sorts manning the stalls along some of London's less-frequented streets. They regularly sell what purports to be high-quality tea, but is in fact merely dyed leaves of drab flavour.
Ryunosuke:
Well...that's certainly unsavoury behaviour.
Sholmes:
So...when one is presented with what appears to be black tea, one must be careful. ...Iris!
Iris:
At the ready, Hurley!
Sholmes:
Let us add a drop of my chemical to this cup of tea here. ...Do you see what happens?
Ryunosuke:
It's turned completely black!
Susato:
And what a foul odour it's giving off!
Sholmes:
Indeed. The blacker the tea becomes, and the more foul the odour...the better the tea is! It would appear that this cup was a particularly fine Darjeeling.
Ryunosuke:
That's...very ingenious. ...But what do you do with that black liquid now?
Sholmes:
Why, dispose of it, naturally. Surely you wouldn't like to drink it...would you?
Susato:
There...does seem to be a rather obvious problem with your new invention, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
Hence why this chemical test is merely a 'test', my dear madam.
Ryunosuke:
(Riiight...)
Sholmes:
The point is, we are entering a new era of science. In the world of criminal investigation, also.
Susato:
Yes! Forensic science! Oh, these are such exciting times!
Sholmes:
I regularly engage in this scientific experimentation alongside my unofficial consulting detective work. The 'Herlock Sholmes Method' will be the foundation upon which modern investigative technique is based. This little tea indicant was a happy by-product of my ongoing forensic science research.
Ryunosuke:
(Forensic science...? I suppose I should find out more about that...)
Japanese people (appears after "Lord van Zieks")
Ryunosuke:
With Mr Natsume, who I'm currently defending, being Japanese as well as Miss Susato and myself... ...I felt it even more keenly in court today. For some reason, Lord van Zieks seems to have...an inherent disdain of the Japanese.
Sholmes:
Indeed... It is an interesting observation.
Susato:
...Do you know something about it? Do you, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
......... It was about ten years ago that Barok van Zieks chose to enter the legal profession. However...before that time... ...the young man's closest companion... ...hailed from the Empire of Japan.
Susato:
No!
Ryunosuke:
What the...?! Tell us more, Mr Sholmes! What happened?!
Sholmes:
......... I believe I've made it clear before... I'm unable to tell you anything about the affair.
Susato:
Oh, but...
Sholmes:
......... The veil will be lifted on the events of the past in due course, I have no doubt. For now, however, it is Mr Moustache who is most deserving of your attention, I believe.
Forensic science (appears after "Foul smell")
Ryunosuke:
So, your 'tea test'... Is that an example of forensic science?
Sholmes:
Indeed it is. An essential tool in cases that hinge on the knowledge of whether some tea is of high or inferior quality.
Ryunosuke:
...Not a huge number of cases, then.
Sholmes:
Perhaps a more practical example is required. ...Fingerprints? Not yet accepted in our courts as evidence, I might add! Really, we are dragging our heels there.
Ryunosuke:
(I hadn't even heard of them until recently...)
Sholmes:
Which is partly why I undertake research in this field myself, of course.
Susato:
Does that mean you're studying fingerprints, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
There are others in that field already. And I abhor the company of inferior minds. No, what I am researching is skin prints!
Ryunosuke:
Skin prints?
Sholmes:
A nomenclature of my own design, as is this chemical agent that makes it possible. It instantly reveals objects touched by whichever person is under investigation.
Susato:
Brilliant, Mr Sholmes!
Ryunosuke:
(...As long as it doesn't turn everything completely odorous and black.)
Sholmes:
I assure you, my dear fellows, you will witness my forensic talents in action very soon indeed!
Present
Pair of Teacups
Sholmes:
Ah yes, the crockery of the failed thespian and the mustachioed bookworm.
Ryunosuke:
His name is Mr Soseki Natsume. You really should try to remember it.
Sholmes:
You're right. After all, I've entrapped the man twice now. Yes, the deeply malicious bookworm has a deeply malicious moustache.
Susato:
Oh dear, I'm not sure about that. A deeply misfortunate moustache, perhaps...
Sholmes:
That too. The moustache is indeed misfortunate. But only because it is malicious!
Susato:
Oh, what wonderful reasoning, Mr Sholmes! You've won me over yet again!
Bar of Soap
Ryunosuke:
I believe...you tried to eat some soap once, didn't you?
Sholmes:
True, yes. I had a theory that it may cleanse the inside of my digestive system, you see.
Ryunosuke:
...Was it particularly dirty, do you think?
Sholmes:
Indeed it was. For I had mistakenly imbibed some ink at the time, assuming it to be coffee. 'I must cleanse at once,' I thought to myself. Quite logically, of course.
Ryunosuke:
...Only you could have an anecdote about swallowing soap.
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Um, Mr Sholmes, about this...
Sholmes:
Dull.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
If you will produce such dull items with such a dull countenance, you must expect a dull response. At the very least, you could do something about your face, my dear fellow. I crave visual stimulation!
Ryunosuke:
Um...something like this?
Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Indeed, that is quite the stimulation I desired!
After clearing all Converse options:
Ryunosuke:
Well, I think we should go back to the scene and see if we can uncover any new clues.
Iris:
That's the spirit, Runo! See you later!
Sholmes:
Yes, until later.
Ryunosuke:
No no, Mr Sholmes! We were thinking you'd come with us.
Sholmes:
You were?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! Of course! You said so just a moment ago! You said we'd witness your forensic talents in action.
Sholmes:
Ah, yes. I do recall saying something along those lines. But you go on ahead. I shall be sure to follow you later...in all likelihood. ...Probably. ...Maybe. ...Well, I might.
Ryunosuke:
...Your commitment astounds me.
Susato:
Oh, thank you, Mr Sholmes! We'll eagerly await your arrival!
Iris:
Bye-bye, Runo! Bye, Susie!
Examine
Herlock Sholmes
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes seems to be making funny faces at something on his desk... I thought he said he was going to come with us to Mr Shamspeare's room.
Susato:
No doubt he's preparing something, Mr Naruhodo. Something amazing!
Sholmes:
...Zzz...
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
And he's doing it whilst asleep! Is there no limit to the man's talents?!
22nd February
Mr Natsume's Lodgings, Ground Floor
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Hello again, Inspector Gregson.
Gregson:
What are you doin' here?
Ryunosuke:
Erm, well...we were hoping to have another look around, actually.
Susato:
The lawyer representing the defendant has a right to examine the scene, as I'm sure you're aware.
Gregson:
Yeah, I know the score.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes, one other thing... The soap on the ledge outside the window. Did you find it? With the tea in it?
Gregson:
Yeah, we found it alright. And there was a small amount of tea in it, as you said.
Ryunosuke:
(I knew it!)
Gregson:
It's with the identification section at the Yard now. They're lookin' into it. The results should be available later today.
Susato:
That's wonderful news! Thank you!
Gregson:
......... Pretty impressive performance in court this mornin'.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gregson:
Nothin'! Forget it! Just make sure you don't disturb anythin' in here!
Examine
Tobias Gregson
Susato:
Are you looking for new clues, Inspector?
Gregson:
...On Lord van Zieks's orders, yeah. 'Don't come back till you've got somethin' for me,' he says! Tsk...
Susato:
Oh dear. Poor you...
Gregson:
Yeah, poor me! Because we've already searched every bleedin' nook and cranny in this place. I dunno what he expects, to be honest. Thank goodness for warm chips, is all I can say.
Ryunosuke:
(...Well, at least he's honest.)
Gas meter
Ryunosuke:
If you ran out of change, you wouldn't even have any light, let alone heat. For the needy, London's winters can be very harsh.
Susato:
That's true. But if you think about it... ...even the wealthy would find themselves freezing if they ran out of small change.
Ryunosuke:
London's winters can be very harsh for the forgetful, too, then. (Frankly, I'm starting to wonder if Susato-san and I are going to make it to spring...)
Susato:
That's true. We don't even have a meter at Baker Street, let alone a gas stove...
Ryunosuke:
Look how dark the stain on the floor is underneath the meter there.
Susato:
Yes, from all the water dripping out after the ice coins melted, as you established in court this morning.
Ryunosuke:
It's a very large and obvious stain, isn't it?
Susato:
Mr Shamspeare must have used an awful lot of ice coins, I suppose.
Ryunosuke:
...It was an ingenious idea, I'll give him that.
Teacups
Ryunosuke:
Ah the ill-fated teacups from which the two men drank on the ill-fated night...
Susato:
During their heated literary debate, yes.
Ryunosuke:
Who's stronger, Romeo or Juliet? ...It sounds like it was quite a 'discussion'.
Susato:
Now I think of it, I'm sure that the two lovers in the play ended their lives with poison... .........
Ryunosuke:
That's fiction, Miss Susato; let's hope it stays that way.
Soap
Susato:
So it turns out that Mr Shamspeare wasn't eating the soap after all.
Ryunosuke:
That's right. The mystery of why he had it on a plate whilst holding a fork in his hand is solved.
Susato:
Yes. To prise his latest ice coin out of its mould. And in the process, he accidentally broke the bar of soap in two...
Ryunosuke:
It certainly was hard to imagine, let alone deduce.
Bricked-up window
Ryunosuke:
The sun never shines in this room, thanks to that depressing bricked-up window.
Susato:
Yet, with enough determination, you can always remove the bricks to set some soap outside, can't you?
Ryunosuke:
That sounds like a very wise life lesson, Miss Susato.
Susato:
...Only if you plan to follow a life of crime, Mr Naruhodo.
Herlock Sholmes (appears after clearing all Converse options in Sholmes's Suite)
Leads to:
"Mr Sholmes!"
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes! What are you up to over there?
Sholmes:
What a question, indeed! Was it not your good self who asked me to attend the scene?
Gregson:
Oi! What are you doin' there, Sholmes?
Sholmes:
'What are you up to over there?' 'What are you doing here?'... Dear me, once a great detective, one is always under scrutiny, it seems.
Susato:
Is now the time, Mr Sholmes? Are you about to show us your forensic talents in action as you promised?!
Sholmes:
With the greatest of pleasure, my dear madam!
Ryunosuke:
Um...what's all this?
Sholmes:
'All this' is precisely what you requested, Mr Naruhodo. Herlock Sholmes's sensational Skin Print Seeker gun! Moments ago, I took a sample from the teacup that was used by the victim.
Ryunosuke:
A sample? From Mr Shamspeare's cup?
Sholmes:
Each individual leaves microscopic secretions on everything he or she touches. A sample of those secretions is all I need to produce this... a refined indicator solution. By liberally spraying the room with this chemical... ...everything the victim touched is instantly revealed with the aid of these goggles. Here, try them out! There. Now, spray the chemical indicator about and all will be revealed?
Ryunosuke:
Spray? How, how do I do that exactly?
Sholmes:
A little press of [A / X / space] on the area you're interested in is all that's required. ...Like this!
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Wh-What is that stuff? It's like fog!
Sholmes:
A suspension of the chemical indicator in a pressurised gas. It's the most efficient way to cover a large area. That was another invention I discovered incidentally whilst I was developing this idea.
Ryunosuke:
(As you do...)
Sholmes:
Go ahead! Try it, my dear fellow! We may learn something interesting about the victim's movements on the night in question.
Ryunosuke:
(Well...there's nothing to lose, I suppose... Let's explore!)
Spray chemical around painting
Ryunosuke:
Look! There are dozens of handprints here!
Sholmes:
So there are. A great many indeed. So much so that it's hard to make out any one individual print, in fact.
Susato:
Brrr... It sends a chill down my spine...
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps...he was leaning against the wall while he admired this picture?
Sholmes:
Unlikely, I would say. It's a rather dull scene, after all.
Susato:
And without wishing to state the obvious... ...you wouldn't generally admire a picture from such close quarters, I feel.
Ryunosuke:
Oh. Very true, Miss Susato. (It's a bit of a mystery, then...)
Spray chemical around floor to right of table
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Look at all this here!
Sholmes:
Ah, yes. Interesting... A multitude of the victim's handprints.
Susato:
Why are there so many of them on the floor in this one spot?
Ryunosuke:
Ooh! Perhaps he had a bad fall just here?
Susato:
There's nothing obvious that he would have tripped over though, is there?
Sholmes:
Hm...I wonder... Personally, I often stumble when there's nothing obvious to trip over.
Susato:
...I think that's something only a great detective would do, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
Well, this is quite a puzzle. Handprints all over the floor...
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, there's no obvious explanation...)
After spraying chemical around painting and floor to right of table:
Ryunosuke:
Well, we sprayed Mr Sholmes's amazing 'skin print' indicator all over this room, didn't we?
Susato:
We did. But there are...two places in particular that are of interest, I would say.
Ryunosuke:
The handprints on the floor there...and on the wall by the picture, you mean?
Susato:
Yes! And I think the floor warrants closer investigation! I won't be a moment... ......... Ah!
Ryunosuke:
What is it, Miss Susato?
Susato:
Look here, Mr Naruhodo! One of the floorboards has popped out!
Ryunosuke:
One of the...? You mean... (It's a secret hiding place?!)
Sholmes:
Excellent work, Miss Susato! So...what do we have in here?
Gregson:
Oi! What are you lot doin'?
Ryunosuke:
Inspector Gregson!
Gregson:
Stand aside right this minute! It's my job to investigate there!
Sholmes:
No need, Inspector. You continue to dig in to your portion of chips, whilst we dig around under the floor here.
Gregson:
Your fancy talk's puttin' me off my food anyway, Sholmes! A new bit of evidence is exactly what I need.
Ryunosuke:
(Wow, a secret hiding place under the floor! What a find!)
Susato:
It's not a hiding place you could make use of in Japan. I don't think I could lift a straw tatami mat...
Ryunosuke:
No, I know. But I never expected one of these wooden floorboards to move, either. It's got me wondering about the wall over there, too. Aren't you curious?
Susato:
Oh! I'll investigate at once! ......... There's nothing behind the picture, sadly. Only the wall.
Sholmes:
Hmmm... How disappointing.
Ryunosuke:
But then...how do you explain the handprints?
Susato:
...I really can't think why anyone would have been touching the wall over and over in one place like that.
*Click!* *Whir...*
Sholmes:
There you are. A print for you.
The photograph of the handprints on the wall has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Thank you very much! (His invention can make prints, too? Now then... ...I wonder if Inspector Gregson has found anything under the floor there...)
Sholmes:
I'm desperate to know!
Susato:
So am I!

Sholmes:
Allow me to ask Gregson now. After all, we're well acquainted. Inspector Gregson! Really, it's been too long!
Gregson:
...What is it, Sholmes?
Sholmes:
I thought perhaps you might show me what you've found there. Seeing as we're such good friends.
Gregson:
...We're not friends.
Sholmes:
...No, I...suppose not. A dismal failure!
Ryunosuke:
Yes...I heard. (Ugh, I'd kill to know what was under that floorboard.)
Gregson:
......... Alright then, fair's fair.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Gregson:
You did discover the hidin' place, after all. I suppose I should at least fill you in.
Ryunosuke:
Really, Inspector? Thank you!
Sholmes:
Do it quickly, my dear fellow! If there's one thing I know about this man, it's that he blows with the wind! As fickle as the weather!
Gregson:
Oi! Stop makin' me out to be some kind of nut! There were three items under the floor there: a newspaper clippin', a photographic print and a tin box. Now...what do you want to know?
Newspaper clipping
Gregson:
Looks like this was cut out of the paper about three months ago. It's about a convict who got sick and died while he was servin' time up in Manchester.
Ryunosuke:
How terrible...
Gregson:
It made the headlines down here in London as well. The bloke had been sentenced to death, you see. But nature got him first...
Susato:
Oh my goodness! He'd committed a capital offense?
Gregson:
Man by the name of Selden. Nasty piece of work, into burglaries and murder. They say the hoard he'd knocked off was worth about a thousand pounds.
Ryunosuke:
A hoard? Of treasure, you mean?
Gregson:
Jewellery and the like. But he'd hidden it somewhere, and no one knows where. And now he's dead. The papers loved it, of course. 'A Thousand Pounds Lost En Route to Hell!' or some such was the headline.
Sholmes:
Does it not strike you, though? Why such an article would be so carefully ensconced under the floor?
Gregson:
......... I suppose now you mention it...it does seem a bit odd. Perhaps I'll go over the paperwork we've got on Selden back at the Yard and see if I can turn anythin' up.
The capital offender article has been entered into the Court Record.

Photographic print
Gregson:
So...this is the photograph I found. Looks reasonably recent to me.
Sholmes:
Yes...it would appear to have been taken on the street in front of the house here.
Susato:
And the gentleman on the left is Mr Garrideb, the landlord, of course.
Ryunosuke:
But who's the young man on the right? Mr Garrideb's son perhaps...?
Gregson:
Perhaps. You can take that print if you like.
Ryunosuke:
Really? Are you sure?
Sholmes:
We can presume, therefore, that the Yard already knows. The identity of the young fellow, that is.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (Is that true?)
Gregson:
Hmph. Well it's too bad if we do. Unfortunately for you lot, leakin' information isn't one of my pastimes.
Sholmes:
My dear inspector, if I may be so bold as to point something out... Pastimes are for one's leisure. But this is for work.
Gregson:
......... All the more reason I'm not tellin' you!
Sholmes:
A dismal failure!
Ryunosuke:
Yes...I heard.
The hidden photograph has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
I wonder why a photograph like this was hidden under the floor... I mean, Mr Shamspeare himself isn't in it.
Sholmes:
Photographic prints are still rare treasures in the East End. I imagine Mr Garrideb was rather delighted to have been immortalised. He probably made a proud present of it.
Photographic print (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
Um, thank you for this photograph, Inspector.
Sholmes:
Yes, taken outside this very building, it would seem.
Ryunosuke:
And the young man on the right is... (...who exactly?)
Gregson:
You're wastin' your time, sunshine. Like I said, leakin' information isn't one of my pastimes.
Sholmes:
My dear inspector, if I may be so bold as to point something out... Information exists for the very purpose of being leaked!
Gregson:
......... Not in my book, it doesn't.
Sholmes:
......... I rather think it's not in my book either, in truth.
Ryunosuke:
...I don't even have a book. (I suppose we'll have to try to find out for ourselves...)
Tin box
Gregson:
Now this tin box looks interestin', doesn't it?
Sholmes:
Might I suggest, Inspector...that you open it? If you were to find something inside that reveals the truth behind this case... ...I wouldn't be in the least surprised.
Gregson:
Yeah, funnily enough I've already had a look. It's completely empty.
Sholmes:
What?! Shamspeare! Give us a clue, man!
Susato:
You didn't even have the chance to utter a word, Mr Naruhodo. But anyway, at least we've found out what's inside the box.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, thin air. It's empty, rather like how I Feel inside. (Is there nothing more to this box, then? I wonder...)
After clearing all options:
Miaow...
Susato:
Oh look! It's that lovely little kitty cat! What was its name...?
Ryunosuke:
It's Mr Natsume's, isn't it? I don't think we ever asked him, actually. Why don't we call it, um...Wagahai? You know, like Mr Natsume refers to himself in Japanese. (I wonder how he got in here? Clever cat...)
Susato:
Oh, wonderful! Well then, Wagahai...here's something delicious I bought for you from the cats' meat man!
Wagahai:
Miaow...
Susato:
Hee hee...he couldn't be happier now, look.
Ryunosuke:
(I just hope we can bring some happiness to his owner, too.)

Wagahai:

Oh! Mr Natsume is back!

So he is. ...Mr Natsume! Hello!
Soseki:
I...am a cat.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Soseki:
I don't know who Mr Natsume is. Or Herr Lock Sholmes. I don't know about courts or trials or Old Baileys. I am a cat. That's what I am. Just a cat.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! He's trying to escape from reality!
Ryunosuke:
(Trying to? He already has! Completely!) SO, um...what is your name, then?
Soseki:
......... As yet I have no name.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! He hasn't fully thought out his new identity yet! Maybe it's not too late to bring him back to reality!
Ryunosuke:
Do you think...you could open your eyes for us, Mr Natsume?
Soseki:
......... I...am not a cat.
Susato:
It worked! He's back in the real world!
Soseki:
Wh-What's going to b-b-become of me? ...NO! DON'T ANSWER THAT! IT'S OBVIOUS! My accursed soul is never going to escape this accursed fate!
Susato:
Mr Natsume, no! This morning's proceedings in court proved that there's hope!
Soseki:
Yes... Yes... Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire was brilliant, but... BUT! THE REAPER IS OMNIPRESENT! IN COURT! IN MY LODGINGS! Here! There! Everywhere!
Ryunosuke:

Soseki:
Oh! Yes... Yes, we must...

This morning's trial
Soseki:
In my WHOLE life...have I EVER been so...so MOVED as I was today? ...NO! Of course...if I cast my mind back, there were perhaps one or two other occasions that moved me more... But if I just block those out, then today, being in that courtroom, was...was... It was the most moving experience OF MY LIFE, Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquiiiiiire!
Ryunosuke:
...You're too kind.
Susato:
Scotland Yard found the remaining tea, just as we'd deduced, and are analysing it as we speak.
Soseki:
There's nothing wrong with that tea! They won't find a drop of poison in it! That's a...
Solemn, Sworn Soseki Certainty!
Ryunosuke:
Tell me...did you both drink the tea at the same time that night?
Soseki:
Oh yes, most definitely. Remember...drink tea while it's hot! We both poured it down our throats like it was a hot bath for our bellies!
Susato:
And at the time...you were both completely fine.
Ryunosuke:
As shown by the fact that he and Mr Shamspeare then engaged in the Romeo and Juliet match. (I suppose the focus of tomorrow's proceedings will be how the poison was taken by the victim, then.)
Mr Shamspeare
Soseki:
That rotten Shamspeare! What have I ever done to him?
Ryunosuke:
You don't recall him taking issue with you over anything you've done recently?
Soseki:
I've been holed up in my room, immersed in books. I don't recall anything... ANYTHING AT ALL!
Ryunosuke:
Right...
Soseki:
But what I don't understand is why he didn't let me know sooner.
Susato:
Let you know what, Mr Natsume?
Soseki:
About the soap, of course! What else?
Susato:
Oh dear... ...are you struggling with such a meagre stipend?
Soseki:
Of course I am! If I had money... ...I wouldn't have chosen to live an accursed existence in such accursed lodgings!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes...you said it's because the place is cursed that it's so cheap, didn't you?
Soseki:
Exactly! Especially the room that I rent. The spirit of that capital offender who lived there still haunts the place, AND IT'S TRYING TO KILL ME!
Ryunosuke:
'Capital offender'...?
Soseki:
Might I ask, Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire, that the next time you visit me... ...you bring scores of super-soft soaps!
Capital offender, Selden (appears after presenting Capital Offender Article)
Soseki:
...The truth is, I didn't know the details myself until very recently. That Selden man was arrested about a year ago now. And at the time, he was hiding out in lodgings...at Mr Garrideb's house.
Ryunosuke:
What? He lived...where you do now?
Soseki:
That's right, yes. Exactly where I live now. In my very room.
Susato:
Oh my! Your room was previously occupied by a criminal found guilty of a capital offence?!
Soseki:
But before his sentence could be carried out, he died in prison. That was three months ago now. ...And that's when it started... The c-c-curse...
Susato:
What really is this curse you keep mentioning, Mr Natsume?
Soseki:
It's already caused one death. A few months after the criminal passed away in prison... ...a man died in the room. The man who rented it after Selden, in fact. The poor lodger... He, he was f-found dead in mysterious circumstances. The room was l-locked from the inside.
Ryunosuke:
Locked from the inside? (Exactly like the case we're dealing with now...!) So that's the convict's curse, is it?
Soseki:
Yes. Well...that was the start of it.
The convict's curse (appears after "Capital offender, Selden")
Susato:
Do you have any idea how the lodger before you passed away, Mr Natsume?
Soseki:
The official cause of death was asphyxia. When they discovered the body, the room was full of gas.
Ryunosuke:
Gas...?
Soseki:
I only found that out after I'd signed the lease. When Mr Garrideb came to tell me later, I couldn't stop myself trembling. In fact, if I'd known beforehand, I'd probably have been too scared to take the room.
Landlord's Lease Luckily Legal!
Ryunosuke:
(Lucky for Mr Garrideb, maybe. But not so lucky for poor Mr Natsume.) And now you believe this curse is affecting you?
Soseki:
It is, it is! At first... ...I just felt as though I was being watched. All the time.
Ryunosuke:
And then you talked about having nightmares, didn't you?
Soseki:
The, the dead are t-trying to take me with them. They c-come for me and try to s-s-suffocate me! Just when I'm s-struggling to breathe...I wake up. And the room IS AS COLD AS ICE!
Susato:
But...why is your room so cold?
Soseki:
London winters are too cold to bear without any heating on overnight. But for some reason...even though I light the stove before I climb into bed at night... ...the pilot light always goes out and the room fills with gas.
Ryunosuke:
But, but that's terrible! (That's exactly the same situation as what led to the previous occupant's death.) And then there's what happened to Mr Shamspeare last night. When he was mysteriously poisoned... (There's clearly more to THAT incident than can be explained by a curse, though...)
Susato:
Whatever can be the cause of all these strange happenings in Mr Garrideb's rooms?

Yes...I'm sure it does. In fact, thinking back to Mr Natsume's other trial just two days ago... ...you were at the Old Bailey then as well, weren't you? Testifying with your wife about what happened.

Your lodgings
Garrideb:
Some fishy fellow from the Far East and a failed actor chap of questionable character, eh? Yes, the house does seem to have become something of a magnet for rum fellows of late. Thanks to that bally curse...
Ryunosuke:
The convict's curse, you mean?
Garrideb:
Ah, heard the stories, have you? Rotten scoundrel was arrested here, then the next chap in the room goes and keels over. Then there was that woman who dropped dead just outside on the street, not to mention the actor yesterday. Am I next, eh? Well...can't help but get the collywobbles, can you?
Susato:
When you say the woman who dropped dead outside on the street...do you mean Miss Green?
Ryunosuke:
Because Miss Green, who was stabbed by the knife, and Mr Shamspeare, who was poisoned last night... ...are both very much alive still.
Garrideb:
Yes, well... So is that blasted convict's curse, it seems.
Sholmes:
Personally, I should be quite content with such lodgings. A bath, a toilet, a fireplace, a fascinating history... Why, it sounds like the lap of luxury!
Ryunosuke:
Hm, I'm not so sure about that...
Garrideb:
Well, there's no bath or toilet included. And no fireplace, either.
Ryunosuke:
But...you do look out for your tenants, don't you? By watching the rise and fall of the flames in your gas lamps up here.
Garrideb:
Yes, never hurts to keep an eye on things. In case there are any...mishaps or suchlike.
Sholmes:
I think you've had your mishap already, sir! Ah ha ha ha ha hah!

Garrideb:
Some fishy fellow from the Far East and a failed actor chap of questionable character, eh?
Ryunosuke:
There's no need for that, Mr Garrideb.
Susato:
That's right. Mr Natsume is in no way 'fishy'!
Sholmes:
Hm...he is undeniably peculiar, however.
Ryunosuke:
Is it right that he took the vacancy immediately after the previous tenant passed away?
Garrideb:
Yes, that's right. I asked the estate agent to find someone and he popped up the very same day. Never come across a chap so keen for a place with...a background, as it were.
Ryunosuke:
I don't think it was the room's background he was keen on so much as the cheap rent, actually.
Susato:
So...how long has Mr Shamspeare been lodging under your roof?
Garrideb:
That failed actor chap? Hm, let me see... Oh, of course! Yes, it's been three months now. Quite sure of it.
Ryunosuke:
(Only three months... He's quite new here too, then.)
Sholmes:
And to what do you owe your certainty in that regard, Mr Garrideb, if I might ask?
Garrideb:
Well, it was that Selden scoundrel, as it happens.
Ryunosuke:
Selden? The convict, you mean? (Do Selden and Shamspeare have some kind of connection, then?)
Shamspeare's tenancy (appears after "Your lodgers")
Garrideb:
That convict chap, Selden... Passed away in the clink three months ago now, you see. Some malady or other.
Susato:
Yes, we've seen the report from the newspaper at the time.

Well, it was only three days later that the tragedian showed his face. The actor fellow.

Garrideb:
Hm, terribly sorry and whatnot, but that won't be possible. Already have a lodger on the middle floor. Ground floor room's vacant, though...
Shamspeare:
'Nothing can be made out of nothing.' ...Let me repeat mine will unto thee.
Garrideb:
Those curls must be muffling your ears! The room on the middle floor's taken. It's ground floor or nothing.
Shamspeare:
......... Very well, we have an accord.
Garrideb:
Glad to hear it. Welcome to Briar Road!
Shamspeare:
Lo, a Shamspeare dance to celebrate!
Garrideb:
From what I heard in court today, sounds like the chap was thieving gas. And he was three months in arrears with the rent, too. Yes, the fellow was a bally player alright!
Sholmes:
Thank you for your candour, Mr Garrideb. We are most grateful. By way of appreciation, allow me to say one or two words... 'Give me my robe, put on my crown. I have immortal longings in me.'
Ryunosuke:
......... What's happened to you?
Sholmes:
Shakespeare, my dear fellow! One of his most famous lines. I wished to divulge my own learning of the subject. For I...have a turn for literature too, you know!
Ryunosuke:
...Perhaps you could turn your attention to more apt lines then?
The lodger's death (appears after presenting Hidden Photograph)
Garrideb:
Yes, Duncan Ross... Young chap was attending art school. Had to work to pay for it, mind. Moved into the middle room floor about a year ago, after that criminal, Selden, was arrested. Young students are always on the hunt for rooms with a history behind them.
Ryunosuke:
A history of cheap rent, maybe, yes...
Garrideb:
Yes, well anyway...it was one morning about a month ago now... Hadn't quite worked out the old trick of watching the gas lamps to see what my lodgers are up to at the time. So sadly, I was rather tardy to discover what had happened. Smell of gas that alerted me, it was.
Sholmes:
Ah yes... Synonymous with the smell of death...
Garrideb:
Called the police straight away, of course, and the officer kicked the door off its hinges. But once we got inside, we all bally collapsed!
Ryunosuke:
Because of the gas?
Garrideb:
Yes. Room was full of it. No air at all. Stove must've gone out while the poor chap was sleeping in his bed.
Ryunosuke:
So Mr Ross suffocated to death...
Garrideb:
'Course, the police gave me a sound ticking off because the gas pipes were so old and all that. Can't tell you how much it set me back to have the lot replaced all over the house.
Ryunosuke:
But even after you had all that work done, Mr Natsume says the same thing. That the stove goes out at night whilst he's asleep in bed.
Garrideb:
Well that's the bally curse! The convict's curse! I've done my duty as a landlord now!

Ah, yes, the 'scene'. I thought the bally fellow was as dead as a doornail! Jolly welcome news that he's alive. For him and for the room.
Ryunosuke:
'For the room'? What do you mean?
Garrideb:
Well, it matters, you know. When I come to let the room next time, people will ask. And there's a world of difference between a room where someone died, and a room where someone nearly died.
Susato:
They sound awfully similar to me...
Gas Meter
Garrideb:
Ah, an Altamont gas meter, yes. Decent fireplace in here, of course, so no need for a gas stove. But there's nothing better than a gas lamp for reading in bed, eh?
Ryunosuke:
Actually, Mr Natsume mentioned that the gas supply to his room kept failing.
Garrideb:
Ah, yes, that... I had the gas company look into it. But they couldn't find a thing wrong. The chap must've been imagining things.
Susato:
I don't think he was imagining it. The poor man woke up unable to breathe.
Garrideb:
Think it was put down to ghosts at work or some such in the end. Place must be haunted.
Hidden Photograph
Ryunosuke:
Mr Garrideb, could I ask you to look at this photograph? Is that your son who's with you there?
Garrideb:
No no, not at all. He was a lodger here once. Duncan Ross was his name.

Yes, where did I put it now...? Ah, here it is! Left it on my desk.
Sholmes:
If you'll excuse me... Let me see now, what does it say...? 'To my most beautiful and charming sweetheart...'
Susato:
Um...do you think that we should be reading such a personal piece of correspondence?
Sholmes:
My dear Miss Susato, that is precisely why I prefaced my reading with 'If you'll excuse me'!
Susato:
I will NOT excuse you, Mr Sholmes, no!
Garrideb:
Sadly he didn't address it, though. So I've no means of delivering the thing. Rather sad, really...
Ryunosuke:
I see... (That's going to play on my mind...)
Susato:
But really, the identity of Mr Ross's sweetheart has no bearing on the case. I think we should leave well alone.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Sholmes:
Indeed, the intended recipient's address is missing. However... ...there is a name attributed to the man's 'most beautiful and charming sweetheart'.
Susato:
Mr Sholmes, please! I've already had to chastise you about this once.
Sholmes:
'...My undying love to you, my colourful darling, Olive Green.'
Susato:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
O... Olive Green?! (The woman who was plunged into a coma after a knife plunged into her back outside this house five days ago! The victim of the last case Soseki-san was in court for, who regained consciousness only yesterday! Is it just chance that her name has come up now? Could it possibly be a mere coincidence?)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, whatever can this mean?
Sholmes:
...Reading personal correspondence can have its merits, you see, Miss Susato. Ah ha ha ha hah!
After clearing all Converse options in Local Prison, Cell 9 and Mr and Mrs Garrideb's Room:
22nd February
St Bartholomew's Hospital, Recovery Ward
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, I've just finished speaking with the doctor. It seems Miss Green is well enough to be discharged at last.
Ryunosuke:
This is good news. But hopefully, just before she leaves-
Susato:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
What is it? Miss Green! (What was that?! She clearly just hid something behind her back!)
Green:
One, one moment! ...I'll be with you in a jiffy! Oh...hello, everyone. What are you all doing here? The doctor has said I can be discharged, so I'm just getting my things together.
Susato:
Miss Green...what were you just doing?
Green:
Oh! Um...nothing...really. I was just about to take some medicine the doctor prescribed for me, that's all.
Ryunosuke:
Well...we were hoping to have another quick chat with you if that's alright?
Green:
I...don't really have anything else to tell you.
Ryunosuke:
(Alright, she's definitely behaving strangely. Let's see if we can't coax something out of her...)
Examine
Card on stool
Ryunosuke:
This is the card that Miss Green was looking at so intently before, isn't it?
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo. We shouldn't be peeking at a young woman's private effects.
Ryunosuke:
(Right. I should save peeking for gentlemen's effects only...)
Susato:
You mustn't do that, either.
Ryunosuke:
And maybe you, Miss Susato, shouldn't be peeking into a young man's mind, either, hm?
Blue bottle
Ryunosuke:
This is the bottle that Miss Green was just about to drink from when we arrived.
Susato:
Yes... She looked rather preoccupied, didn't she?
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps it's very bitter. I can't stand bitter medicine.
Susato:
I suppose that could be it...
Ryunosuke:
In fact, whenever a doctor prescribes me medicine for a number of days, I always take it all at once.
Susato:
Oh no!
Ryunosuke:
Well, if you have to take something you don't like, it's best to get it all out of the way in one go, isn't it?
Susato:
Oh dear... And I thought it was Miss Green I should be worrying about at the moment...
Converse
Hospital discharge
Ryunosuke:
It's wonderful news that you're going to be discharged, Miss Green.
Green:
Oh, yes... I mean, thank you. Once people are better, the hospital staff don't want them lingering and wasting space. Not people like me, anyway. So I...I don't think I should keep anyone waiting. I probably shouldn't stand around and chat.
Ryunosuke:
(She certainly doesn't seem to be in the mood to talk, that's for sure.)
Present
Bar of Soap
Ryunosuke:
Miss Green, about this soap...
Green:
...! I, I think I know what that is... It's that soap-shaped chocolate, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Um...no. This is just normal soap. Well, normal, poor-quality soap.
Green:
Oh... That was lucky... At least it wasn't a trick this time...
Susato:
A trick?
Green:
I fell for it only the other day. 'It's soap-shaped chocolate,' they said. Just one bite, and I was foaming at the mouth. I passed out, it tasted so awful!
Susato:
Oh my...
Ryunosuke:
(What is it about people recently that makes them all eat soap...?)
Crime Scene Photograph
Ryunosuke:
Um, is there perhaps something you might be able to tell me if I show you this photograph, Miss Green?
Green:
Oh, is that...a corpse?
Ryunosuke:
No no! He's not dead!
Green:
Of course, the night he had that poison... ...I was still more or less dead here in my hospital bed.
Ryunosuke:
Ah... (She was still in a coma then, that's true.)
Green:
And then just as I get on my feet again, that man keels over. There's a strange balance to life sometimes...
Ryunosuke:
No no no. Really, Mr Shamspeare isn't dead.
Hidden Photograph
Leads to:
"Miss Green, we were hoping to ask you about someone."
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Miss Green, about this...
Green:
Ah! Could you just hold that there for a moment? Don't move...
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Green:
......... No. No, the aesthetics are all wrong.
Ryunosuke:
(Is, is it wrong that I feel so thoroughly rejected...?)
Ryunosuke:
Miss Green, we were hoping to ask you about someone. Mr Duncan Ross. You...knew him, didn't you? Oh no! I'm so sorry! (The bottle of medicine fell down when she did!)
Susato:
Oh, Miss Green! Are you alright?
Ryunosuke:
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to startle you like that.
Green:
No. No, it's alright. I just wasn't expecting it. But how do you know about Duncan?!
Susato:
Mr Ross had been writing a letter when he passed away. The landlord found it in his room. It...was a very personal letter...to you.
Green:
......... It was at the art school. That's where I met Duncan. A year ago now. He was working to fund his studies. He dreamt of becoming a professional artist one day.
Susato:
And the two of you became romantically involved?
Green:
...Yes, that's right. We were very much in love. We were engaged to be married, actually. That's why he decided to move into a cheaper room. To save money for the wedding.
Ryunosuke:
And that's what led him to Mr Garrideb's...
Green:
Yes. He told me he'd found the worst, but cheapest room in the entire East End. And then...one month ago... That's when it happened.
Susato:
We're so terribly sorry, Miss Green.
Green:
Well...it's all in the past now, I suppose.
Susato:
Poor Miss Green... She looks desperately sad.
Ryunosuke:
(I was starting to think that's just her 'look'... ...but now I see that she has every reason to feel the universe is against her.)
Examine
Picture frame
Ryunosuke:
Mr Duncan Ross... Who would ever have thought he was engaged to be married to Miss Green?
Susato:
To lose one's beloved fiancé must be painful enough.
Ryunosuke:
But then Miss Green suffered that awful injury. And outside her fiancé's former lodgings, too!
Susato:
Fate can be very cruel sometimes...
Spilled blue bottle
Ryunosuke:
The bottle fell off before, when Miss Green collapsed. (That was...quite an earthquake...)
Susato:
Whatever was in the bottle?
Ryunosuke:
(Honey, maybe... Or treacle... Or syrup... Or all three mixed together, even...)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo... ...you've been having a lot of very mean thoughts during this exchange. I'm disappointed in you.
Ryunosuke:
...Sorry.
After clearing Converse option and presenting Hidden Photograph:
Green:
Um...I do hope you won't think I'm being rude, but... ...would you mind leaving me in peace now? I have to leave the hospital soon.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I'm so sorry! We didn't mean to hold you up. Of course, we'll be on our way-
???:
Mr Naruhodo!
Sholmes:
Surely you were not about to leave? That's quite out of the question!
Ryunosuke:
Wha... Mr Sholmes! I didn't realise you were here!
Sholmes:
But of course I was, my dear fellow. Watching intently from the shadows as always.
Ryunosuke:
Well...make your presence known next time!
Susato:
Mr Sholmes, what's this about?
Sholmes:
Something which occurs to me with some regularity, Miss Susato, is this: Why do detectives insist on such an ex post facto modus operandi? Why solve a case after it's happened... ...instead of preventing a case before it happens? That is what sets a great detective apart!
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Sholmes:
There is a case waiting to happen under our very noses, Mr Naruhodo. So let us avert disaster! Let us prevent this case from ever happening...with nothing but careful observation.
Ryunosuke:
...Alright.
Sholmes:
All the clues you need are set before you. You need only look, and you cannot fail to see!
Susato:
You can do it, Mr Naruhodo! I know you can!
Examine
Card on stool
Ryunosuke:
It definitely feels as though this card must be relevant. I mean, when we first arrived... ...Miss Green was standing with it in her hand in what can only be described as a very tense atmosphere.
Susato:
Yes... It may very well be related to whatever incident Mr Sholmes believes was about to happen here. Perhaps we should ask Miss Green about it.
Spilled blue bottle or mouse
Ryunosuke:
That mouse seems to be dead, look. I didn't notice it there before, did you?
Susato:
I think perhaps it drank the medicine that spilled out of the bottle. But that's the bottle that Miss Green was about to drink from when we arrived.
Ryunosuke:
......... You, you don't think...?
Sholmes:
Ah, I see you've come to appreciate the true nature of this scene. That of a tragedy about to take place.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I... I think it's falling into place. Miss Green, the contents of the bottle you had before has spilt out on the floor... ...and the poor mouse that drank it has sadly died.
Green:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
I think it's clear that the bottle must have contained a powerful poison.
Green:
.........
Susato:
Don't worry. I will attend to the mouse presently.
Sholmes:
Miss Green... ...were you intending to go the same way as that rodent? To take your own life?
Green:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
Once we'd left... ...you would have put it to your lips again, wouldn't you? And taken the poison?
Green:
I... I... NOOOOOOOOO!!!
Susato:
Miss Green, please! Please talk to us!
Green:
.........
Spilled blue bottle (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
I can't believe she was going to take that poison...
Susato:
Mr Sholmes, your keen observational skills have saved Miss Green's life!
Sholmes:
To become a truly great detective, one must solve cases before they have occurred.
Susato:
Oh, what a delightful idea!
Sholmes:
Indeed! And why not, from time to time?
Ryunosuke:
Why not all the time? Then London would be entirely without crime!
Sholmes:
And I would be entirely without an income. Everything in moderation, my dear fellow.
Susato:
...? Did you say something, Mr Sholmes?
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, the truth. But when it comes to Mr Sholmes, you do tend to turn a deaf ear to it sometimes, Susato-san.)
Converse
Suicide (appears after examining spilled blue bottle or mouse)
Sholmes:
Ten seconds later, and we would have arrived at a very different scene here. In all probability, we would not have enjoyed this most delightful conversation. Of course...perhaps it hasn't been quite so delightful from your perspective, Miss Green.
Green:
......... Actually, in a way... ...now that everything's out in the open, I feel like a weight has been lifted.
Ryunosuke:
Tell me...how did you acquire that 'medicine'?
Green:
......... Well, with this being a hospital and all... When the doctor comes to examine me in the mornings... ...he always leaves the medicine cabinet open for a while. So I snuck this out when he wasn't looking.
Sholmes:
It conspicuously lacks a label. I wonder what it contains.
Green:
I'm afraid I don't really know. But I thought, if I drank it, it might just...stop the pain somehow.
Susato:
Oh please, Miss Green. Don't talk of such things.
Ryunosuke:
Well, it seems clear now that it contains poison.
Susato:
Yes, that poor little mouse is proof of that.
Green:
Oh no... Oh, it's all my fault... What have I done...?
Sholmes:
I shall remove this to my office, Miss Green. ...I take it you have no objection?
Green:
...No. None.
The card (appears after examining card on stool)
Susato:
Neither the sender's name or address appear to be written on the envelope or the card.
Green:
It arrived by post at my home the day before the incident that put me in hospital here.
Ryunosuke:
'I have information regarding the death of Duncan Ross. Come to The Slug and Salad on Briar Road at 5 p.m. on 17th. Don't tell anybody else about this letter or the meeting. It is a matter of utmost importance.'
Green:
.........
Ryunosuke:
...Wait a minute. The seventeenth? Of this month? That's the day... That's the day you were stabbed on Briar Road!
Susato:
And...5 p.m...
Sholmes:
...Is precisely the time when the incident occurred!
Green:
.........
Sholmes:
The Slug and Salad, yes... A pub on the northern corner of Briar Road.
Ryunosuke:
Briar Road... (...being the street that Mr Garrideb's house is on!)
Susato:
Does this mean that...?
Green:
Yes. I'm sure you've guessed. That day, when I was struck in the back by the knife... ...I was actually on my way to The Slug and Salad.
Susato:
Goodness...
Ryunosuke:
So that's what you were doing on Briar Road that day.
Green:
......... I'm sorry I didn't say anything before.
After clearing all Converse options:
Green:
I think...I really will have to ask you to excuse me now. I've told you everything.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, I'm very sorry to have had to drag up such painful memories for you.
Green:
No, it's fine.
Susato:
Miss Green... ...please, promise us you won't try to...do anything like that again.
Green:
Yes, don't worry. Your detective friend has the bottle now anyway. And besides... ...I've been stabbed in the back and had a close shave with a bottle of poison and I'm still here. I think...I'm destined to see things through to the end. It might sound a little conceited, but, well...that's how all this has made me feel.
Leaving Miss Green and St Bartholomew's behind... ...we made our way back to Baker Street with Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
Well, it would appear we've reached the end of the investigative trail for today.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...it's late.
Sholmes:
And, Mr Naruhodo...? ...Did you discover anything that may be of use to you in court tomorrow, do you think?
Ryunosuke:
Details about Mr Shamspeare...Mr Garrideb's lodgings... the convict, Selden... There are many facets to this case, and we're yet to see to the heart of it, if you ask me. That's my feeling, anyway.
Susato:
I can't help wondering about the results of the analysis.
Ryunosuke:
Into Mr Natsume's tea, you mean?
Susato:
Yes. Will they have found strychnine in it or not?
Sholmes:
Well, I fear that either way... ...it will be hard to escape the grip of our friend Mr Reaper.
Susato:
Oh dear...
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, Barok van Zieks...)
Sholmes:
But I wish you every success, of course. And though I was late to rise this morning... ...tomorrow will be a new dawn! I intend to spring from my bed at a crisp hour and attend the trial.
Susato:
Mr Sholmes! You're going to come?
Sholmes:
Indeed! Whatever happens, I shall be there! ...Assuming my eyelids cooperate in the morning.
Ryunosuke:
Well...I think we've done all we can. All that's left is to remain focused and keep fighting for Mr Natsume's cause until the very end.
London, the world's most prosperous city, home to some six million people. But away from the razzle-dazzle, down back alleys and behind bricked-up windows...the lonely lurk. Soseki-san had battled long and hard with loneliness during his many months here. And so I felt honour-bound to battle equally hard for my compatriot. To lift the curse that gripped him. As Mr Sholmes said, tomorrow would be a new dawn...for all of us!
To be continued...
Examine insignificant area on evidence
Ryunosuke:
I can't find anything out of place.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Ryunosuke:
(Nothing particular of note...)
