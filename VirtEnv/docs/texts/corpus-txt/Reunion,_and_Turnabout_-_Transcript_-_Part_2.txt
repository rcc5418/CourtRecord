Maya:
Whaaaaaaaat!? Prosecutor von Karma!? You mean...?
Phoenix:
No, I heard it's his successor this time...
Maya:
Successor...? ... Manfred von Karma. He was a really sinister man. He pulled all sorts of nasty tricks; all so he could win.
Phoenix:
(He was a man obsessed with the word "perfection"... He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor... I wonder what kind of person they will turn out to be...)
Maya:
It's no good...
Mystic Maya!!
Maya:
Pearly! You showed up! Thanks for coming all this way!
Pearl:
I was really worried about you...
Maya:
Hey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together?
Pearl:
Mother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks.
Maya:
Huh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself?
Pearl:
Yup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map.
Phoenix:
Don't tell me you walked all the way here...
Pearl:
Of course not! ...I ran!
Phoenix:
That's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...)
Maya:
Pearly... What about the train?
Pearl:
Huh? What's a... "tray-in"?
Phoenix:
(I give up...)
Pearl:
...It's time, isn't it?
Maya:
Um... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma!
Pearl:
Mr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that?
Maya:
Um, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Maya:
I still remember him as if I had just seen him only yesterday.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Maya:
Every trial was a scorching fierce battle until the very end.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Maya:
It was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life...
Phoenix:
Maya! Please don't mention that name ever again...
Maya:
Huh...? But why, Nick?
Phoenix:
I'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back...
Maya:
Whaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!?
Bailiff:
Court will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom.
Phoenix:
... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway.
Maya:
N...Nick...?
June 21, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared?
???:
...
Phoenix:
... (What is with this girl...?)
Judge:
... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?
Phoenix:
Huh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?)
???:
Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Phoenix:
...!
???:
You must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct?
Phoenix:
(...Hold on. So this kid is the "famed" Prosecutor von Karma...?)
von Karma:
I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy.
Phoenix:
I... see...
von Karma:
I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge.
Phoenix:
Revenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?)
Judge:
Um... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww!
von Karma:
I'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me.
Phoenix:
(Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!!
von Karma:
Make no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!
Judge:
Prosecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please...
von Karma:
Those of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is "perfection". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch.
Judge:
V-Very well... What is the defense's position?
Phoenix:
Your Honor.
Judge:
Does the defense wish to enter a plea of "not guilty"?
Phoenix:
...Yes.
von Karma:
Foolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the "justified self-defense" plea in no time.
Phoenix:
("Justified self-defense"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself. We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of "not guilty", Your Honor! (Because to plead "justified self-defense" is to say you did kill someone.)
von Karma:
How foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness.
Phoenix:
(She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.)
von Karma:
Witness, your name and occupation?
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!!
von Karma:
Get to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder.
Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room.
Judge:
What were they doing in there?
Gumshoe:
Um... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir.
Judge:
Ch-Channeling a spirit??
Phoenix:
(The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...)
Gumshoe:
*ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room.
Judge:
Ah, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over.
Floor Plans added to the Court Record.
Judge:
So, how was the victim killed?
Gumshoe:
I was about to get to that...
von Karma:
Stop wasting my time, then.
Witness Testimony
-- Cause of Death --
Gumshoe:
The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.
The shot was fired from point-blank range.
But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.
The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.
The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.
Judge:
Hmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot...
Gumshoe:
This is the victim's autopsy report, sir.
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Judge:
The court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.
Cross Examination
-- Cause of Death --
Gumshoe:
The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was  it?
Gumshoe:
It was the victim's.
Phoenix:
The victim?  Now, why would he have...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
"Why would he have a pistol?"  Who cares? The point that you are missing  is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start.
Judge:
Fingerprints? There were fingerprints?
Gumshoe:
Along with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir.
Judge:
Hmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.)
Gumshoe:
The shot was fired from point-blank range.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Point blank, huh? So about how far away was it?
Gumshoe:
It was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away.
Phoenix:
And how do you know he was shot at point blank?
von Karma:
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country...
Phoenix:
E-Excuse me!?
von Karma:
Gunpowder burn.
Phoenix:
...Gunpowder burn?
von Karma:
When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.
Gumshoe:
Gunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead!
Phoenix:
(Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...)
Gumshoe:
But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Stabbed... And what was he stabbed with?
Gumshoe:
A fruit knife.
Judge:
I see. And whose knife was it?
Gumshoe:
It looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it.
Judge:
Hmm... All over it, huh?
Phoenix:
(Urk. This does not look good...)
von Karma:
Ha ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright?
Gumshoe:
The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How severe was the wound?
Gumshoe:
If it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand.
Phoenix:
(This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...)
Gumshoe:
The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure he was stabbed first, then shot?
Gumshoe:
Yup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal.
von Karma:
A fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:
(Grr... What a pain...)
Phoenix:
(Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...)
(Pressing first, second, third and fifth statements leads to:)
Judge:
That's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered.
Gumshoe:
I brought the two murder weapons with me today.
Judge:
Very well. The court accepts them into evidence.
Pistol added to the Court Record.
Knife added to the Court Record.
von Karma:
The date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time.
Judge:
And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...? Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case.
von Karma:
Naturally!
Phoenix:
(This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...)
von Karma:
Your Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there?
Judge:
That is quite true... Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
Judge:
Even in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead "not guilty"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose.
von Karma:
See, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes...
Judge:
What will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to "justified self-defense"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance.
Phoenix:
(This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!)
Plead justified self-defense
Phoenix:
(If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to "justified self-defense"...
von Karma:
Hah.
Judge:
Understood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea.
Phoenix:
(...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?)
Mia:
...You already hold the key... ...If you don't believe, you cannot win...
Phoenix:
(...! If we plead "justified self-defense", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor!
Judge:
Y-Yes?
Phoenix:
The defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty!
Leads to:
"...You."
Plead not guilty
Phoenix:
(If we plead "justified self-defense"... we would basically be confessing to a murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'd be labeled a murderer... I can't let that happen!) Your Honor!
Judge:
Have you reached a conclusion, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The defense will not change its plea. We will accept nothing short of complete acquittal!
Leads to:
"...You."
von Karma:
...You. You have sealed your fate, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Detective!
Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir!
von Karma:
Present the final portion of your testimony -- the final strike.
Gumshoe:
Um... Y-Yes... sir...
Judge:
N-Now, see here! Proceedings are run by... Eek!
von Karma:
...
Judge:
Oh, yes, of course. Go ahead Detective and give your testimony...
von Karma:
I think the court would like to hear about the other piece of incriminating evidence!
Witness Testimony
-- Incriminating Evidence --
Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.
This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.
As you can see, it's covered in blood.
The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.
Judge:
So this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this.
Gumshoe:
This piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir.
Judge:
I see... The court accepts this into evidence.
Maya's Costume added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Alright, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??)
von Karma:
Hah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer. Feel free to sulk off with your tail between your legs, Mr. Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:
(Please stop calling me by my full name. It's disturbing.)
Cross Examination
-- Incriminating Evidence --
Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why didn't you say so in your testimony earlier!?
Gumshoe:
Uh... You're kinda scary today, you know, pal?
Judge:
Come now, Mr. Wright... There is no need for that kind of attitude in my court...
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
A-Alright. Just, please stop glaring at me like that...
Gumshoe:
This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Maya's... costume?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. She was wearing this when we arrested her.
Phoenix:
(Maya... She's wearing her channeling costume today too... Is she not allowed to wear anything else...?)
Gumshoe:
As you can see, it's covered in blood.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
This blood on the costume...
Gumshoe:
Lab results show that it is the victim's blood.
Judge:
Hmm... So there is blood from the victim on the defendant's clothes.
Phoenix:
(Definitely not good... Urk.) Hmm, where there any other clues you could gleam from this piece of evidence?
Gumshoe:
Um, well...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
If you must change the topic, then the good detective here must testify again. But too bad. Not enough time. Time to move on.
Judge:
Ah, yes, Ms. von Karma is perfectly correct...
Phoenix:
(Grr... Now even the Judge is on her side! But if I bite off more than I can chew here... What should I do!?)
Press further
Phoenix:
(Why is Ms. von Karma suddenly putting up resistance? There must be a reason as to why she suddenly threw out an objection like that... There must be a clue somewhere on this costume! I just have to look harder!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Ms. von Karma's logic is perfect. There is no way for you to poke a hole in it.
Phoenix:
(Argh! Looks like my time is up. So, about the costume...)
There is nothing wrong.
Phoenix:
(If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this.
Judge:
Good. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony.
There is one little thing...
Phoenix:
Your Honor. Actually, there is something very wrong with this piece of evidence.
Judge:
Wh-What!?
Gumshoe:
What are you talking about, pal!?
von Karma:
...
Judge:
Wh-Where is this problem you are talking about!?
Phoenix:
(I've come this far... There's no turning back now!) The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!
Present bullet hole
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
I ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume.
Judge:
The sleeve? ...! There is a tiny hole here...
Gumshoe:
..A... A hole...? But that wasn't in the report.
Judge:
Hold on! What's this around the hole? I-It smells faintly of gunpowder!
Gumshoe:
G-Gunpowder!? No one ever told me!
Judge:
A hole that smells of gunpowder...
Phoenix:
(It looks like I've found the "hole" I was looking for!) Your Honor, the only logical conclusion you can make is that it must be a bullet hole!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!! This is a very grave matter. It's best we correct the Court Record first before anything else.
Maya's Costume updated in the Court Record.
Gumshoe:
Sorry about that. I guess we messed up, sir.
von Karma:
...
Phoenix:
...! (I-Is she actually... smiling!? What else is she hiding!?)
von Karma:
Pull yourself together, Detective. That tiny "hole" doesn't change a thing. The strength of the evidence still holds. Continue with your testimony. That, just now, was a fluke. Nothing more.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
H-How can you say something like that!? This is a huge oversight!
Judge:
While I agree it is a mistake on the part of the police, what Prosecutor von Karma has said is true. The evidence still stands. If you do not find a more definitive problem with the evidence, then...
Phoenix:
No way!!
Judge:
Detective Gumshoe, please continue with your testimony.
Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir.
Present blood splatter
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The problem is obviously the blood splatter here!
Judge:
B-But... We've determined that the blood splatter is from the victim. Where is the problem in that?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, where, pal?
Phoenix:
Yeah... I wonder about that too...
Judge:
That last antic of yours just pushed me over the top, Mr. Wright. I am declaring that this cross-examination period is over...
Phoenix:
P-Please wait, Your Honor! (Ack! I'd better not mess up again...)
Leads back to:
"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
There is a problem... somewhere around... here!
Judge:
Wh-What does he mean, Ms. von Karma?
von Karma:
There's nothing wrong with it. The only thing wrong here is the defense's head.
Judge:
Well said. You certainly do take after your father!
Phoenix:
(I've just been made to look like a fool again... Alright... Focus, Phoenix!)
Leads back to:
"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!"
Let it go
Phoenix:
(If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this.
Judge:
Good. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony.
Press (subsequent times, after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record)
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Alright. I'll give you that the blood spatter is from the victim, but... what is this hole in the sleeve?
Gumshoe:
Um... Sorry, pal. We must've thought it was just a tear in the seam...
Phoenix:
Missing the hole is not what I'm asking you about. I'm talking about the hole itself! The smell of gunpowder  clearly gives away that... it is a bullet hole!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
As if little things like that matter.
Phoenix:
But they do.
von Karma:
A "bullet hole" in the sleeve, blood splatter all over the costume... Neither of these things can change the fact the defendant killed the victim.
Phoenix:
(...Grr... I know there's something more to that costume.)
von Karma:
Come now Detective. You're wasting precious time.
Gumshoe:
... Yes, sir.
Gumshoe:
The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
He wasn't "fighting back"? How do you know if he was or wasn't!?
Gumshoe:
We could find no evidence that the victim put up any sort of struggle, pal.
Judge:
Hmm... So did the murderer have a fight with the victim, or not? Depending on this, the circumstances around this murder change drastically.
Phoenix:
(Ugh... We're in real trouble now... If only I had something to prove that the victim did fight back...)
Present Maya's Costume (after it is updated in the Court Record)
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Detective Dick Gumshoe!"
Phoenix:
(That Von Karma! She thinks she can decide the verdict with this testimony alone! I have to somehow find a critical contradiction and then I'll have her!)
Phoenix:
Detective Dick Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Y-Yes? Heh, having you call me by my full name is kind of a weird feeling...
Phoenix:
You said that my client killed "a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back."
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I did.
Phoenix:
Then what, may I ask, is the bullet hole you police overlooked supposed to mean!?
Gumshoe:
Eh, um... What does it mean?
Phoenix:
I'll tell you what it means. It means that the victim had fired off a shot. Is this what it means to "not fight back"?
Gumshoe:
A-Ah! You're right!
Judge:
It would seem that way! If the victim tried to shoot the defendant, then... It would change everything...
Phoenix:
(Alright! The wind seems to be shifting...)
von Karma:
Hah.
Phoenix:
(What is with that "are you finished yet" laugh?)
von Karma:
Are you finished yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright?
Judge:
Ms. von Karma?
von Karma:
It seems... that Maya Fey was shot at by the victim. However, that is only grounds enough to support a "justified self-defense" plea.
Judge:
That is correct.
von Karma:
But I'm sure you remember, Your Honor, what the defense clearly said. They rejected "justified self-defense" and pleaded "not guilty."
Phoenix:
Ack!
Gumshoe:
Now that you...
Judge:
Why, that's right!
von Karma:
Which means! The defense has yet to prove anything at all!
Phoenix:
Nooooo!!
Judge:
W-Well... Yes, that's true...
von Karma:
Furthermore... just the fact that there is a bullet hole in the costume... is not enough to substantiate even a plea of "justified self-defense".
Judge:
Huh? How so?
Gumshoe:
Aaah!
von Karma:
Don't just stand there. Hurry up and tell the court what transpired that day. ...With the new information we acquired added in, of course.
Gumshoe:
Huh? You mean... By myself...? You want me to put together the scenario all by myself? Aah!
von Karma:
...
Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir! Right away, sir!
Witness Testimony
-- What Transpired --
Gumshoe:
During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.
Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.
While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.
The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.
The defendant then picked up on the opening, took the victim's gun and ended it...
Judge:
Hmm... This scenario you have put together does make sense...
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir.
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Just by listening, it does make sense... However, I won't give up that easily!)
Judge:
P-Please refrain from glaring at me like that... Now then, your cross-examination, please.
Cross Examination
-- What Transpired --
Gumshoe:
During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
There is quite a difference in height between Dr. Grey and the defendant. Add in body strength, and it seems unlikely the defendant could have stabbed the victim!
Gumshoe:
Now that you mention it... Yeah, I guess...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
You think you can get away with such flimsy reasoning? Mr. Phoenix Wright! Maya Fey was in the middle of channeling, was she not?
Phoenix:
...?
von Karma:
When channeling with the Kurain Channeling Technique, the medium physically changes. With the nurse's build, the defendant could have easily been a match for the doctor.
Phoenix:
(I don't believe it... She even studied up on the Kurain Channeling Technique!)
von Karma:
Like I said before... I am perfect.
Judge:
Um... Uh... About what you were talking about... I didn't quite get it...
Phoenix:
...
von Karma:
...
Judge:
Um, n-never mind. Let's continue with the testimony...
Gumshoe:
Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So he was stabbed, but the stab wound didn't kill him.
Gumshoe:
But if you think about the blood loss, it was pretty bad.
Phoenix:
How bad would you say it was?
Gumshoe:
Actually, I went to give blood the other day. And afterward, I felt a little lightheaded and dizzy. ...I guess the damage was maybe... about 10 times the dizziness...? Ack!
von Karma:
...
Gumshoe:
S-Sorry!
Gumshoe:
While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Where in the world did that pistol come from?
Gumshoe:
It looks like the victim, Dr. Grey had specifically bought it for that day.
Phoenix:
But a handgun...?
Gumshoe:
He got it off the black market about 2 days before the murder.
Phoenix:
(Why did Dr. Grey bring a gun...? Was he taking precautions against something...?)
Gumshoe:
The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, you're saying that the bullet hole in this costume was made then?
Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal, but that's what I'd think. The two of them were already fighting when a shot was fired.
Phoenix:
(Maya... I'm really glad you weren't hurt...)
von Karma:
...
Present Maya's Costume
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Missing the tiny hole on this costume..."
Gumshoe:
The defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun and ended it...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Maya has never fired a gun before in her life!
Gumshoe:
The victim had already taken off the safety. With the safety off, even an amateur like you can fire it by pulling the trigger.
Phoenix:
(Even me...? I wonder...?)
von Karma:
Now do you understand? A Von Karma's logic is perfect.
Phoenix:
(His testimony certainly makes us look very bad, but there's gotta be a contradiction in there somewhere... And uncovering it is going to uncover the truth! I can feel it!)
Phoenix:
Missing the tiny hole on this costume... will be the prosecution's undoing.
Gumshoe:
Eh? What do you mean?
Phoenix:
This little hole has actually created a huge hole in your testimony!
Judge:
E-Explain yourself, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
You said the two of them were fighting when the victim fired his gun at point blank. If that were true, then where is the gunpowder burn on this costume!?
Gumshoe:
G-Gunpowder... burn?
Phoenix:
This is what you testified earlier: "When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole."
Gumshoe:
OH!
Phoenix:
But there is not a single trace of gunpowder burn on this costume!!
Judge:
That is a very good point. And... what exactly does this mean?
Phoenix:
It means that when the shot was fired, they were standing apart from each other.
Judge:
Hmm...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
I'm disappointed, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You think you can punch a hole in my logic with that? With wishy-washy thinking like that, anyone can explain anything away!
Phoenix:
Then I implore you to disprove my line of thinking.
von Karma:
Let's see... In the middle of their fight, the victim pushed the defendant away. And it was then, when they were separated, that he fired! How was that?
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
As if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that!
von Karma:
...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself. And then while she was preparing to strike again, the doctor took his shot. There. That sound satisfy even you.
Judge:
Hmm... That does make an awful lot of sense. What do you think, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(I must be careful. I can't afford to make a mistake here! Concentrate and think!)
It makes sense.
Phoenix:
(Ack, it's no good. I can't find a "hole" in her logic at all this time...) I admit it. Somehow, your reasoning makes logical sense.
von Karma:
That's it. That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Drat. It's 11:00 AM. I've already missed my morning tea. ...However. At least we were able to arrive at a conclusion.
Judge:
Hmm... It does look that way.
Phoenix:
(...Oh boy... If I don't do something soon, it'll be curtains for Maya...)
Judge:
Well then, I think we can...
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Please... Wait!
Judge:
Who was that? Mr. Wright? Please refrain from making unnecessary outbursts!
Phoenix:
(I don't care how, but I must find something to go on in Von Karma's explanation!)
Leads to:
"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!"
Something doesn't make sense.
Leads to:
"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!"
Phoenix:
There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!
Gumshoe:
Fatal...?
Judge:
Flaw...!? Yeow!
von Karma:
Very interesting. I would love to see where this "flaw" is! Show me something that contradicts my explanation!
Phoenix:
(There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere! "She put some distance between them before rushing to make the final blow. And when she was about to strike, the doctor took his shot." There must be a piece of evidence that contradicts this line of thinking!)
Present Folding Screen
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Take a look at this!
Gumshoe:
Why are you showing this to me, pal?
Phoenix:
Prosecutor von Karma's explanation and this piece of evidence...
Gumshoe:
...Do not contradict!
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Gumshoe:
Haha, looks like you need to use your brain a little more, pal.
Phoenix:
(Ugh... Being lectured by Gumshoe, of all people, is so embarrassing...)
Gumshoe:
Come on! Hurry up and get that thinking cap on!
Leads back to:
"(There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere!)"
Phoenix:
This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.
Judge:
What is that? A folding screen?
Phoenix:
I would like to point the court's attention to the "hole" in this folding screen.
von Karma:
Aaah!
Phoenix:
It looks like you already know what I'm talking about.
Gumshoe:
Who? Where? What?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Your explanation, please!
Phoenix:
(Are these two really that clueless...?) The bullet went through the defendant's sleeve first, then the folding screen. It passed through at a height of approximately 8 inches off the ground... Which means! When the shot was fired, Maya... I mean, the defendant, was not getting ready to strike, but was actually squatting low to the ground!
Judge:
Order! Order! Th-This changes everything!
Phoenix:
Please look at this diagram of the crime scene. The victim, Dr. Grey was here when he fired the shot. And the bullet hit this folding screen. It hit at this location, about 8 inches off the ground. At this time, the defendant was in this area.
Present area next to the bullet hole
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"She was standing here, near the folding screen!"
Present area behind the folding screen
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Here!
Judge:
Behind the folding screen...?
Phoenix:
Ack!
von Karma:
The victim and his attacker were fighting, were they not? Then what would the attacker be doing all the way back there!?
Phoenix:
Um...
von Karma:
Besides which, if the attacker was behind the folding screen, then how could the victim even know where to shoot? It's obviously impossible!
Phoenix:
... Yeah, I guess so...
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Boy, did I just screw up royally... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)
Leads back to:
"At this time, the defendant was in this area."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Somewhere around here!
Judge:
...?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. The judge's face is scrunched like he just smelled some serious bad breath...) Uhh... Um... That is, I mean...
Judge:
Wait! I just realized I forgot to brush this morning... Excuse me while I freshen up.
Phoenix:
Uh, sure...
Judge:
In the meantime, I want you to think things through again, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Ah, of course... Whoops... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)
Leads back to:
"At this time, the defendant was in this area."
Phoenix:
She was standing here, near the folding screen!
von Karma:
W-Wait a second! We know the defendant was close to the ground based on the height of the bullet hole. But... How can you gauge the distance from that!? Isn't it possible that the defendant was standing much closer to the victim?
Phoenix:
That's impossible.
von Karma:
B-But why!?
Phoenix:
You, of all people, should know the answer to that question, Ms. von Karma. If she were shot from somewhere closer, there would be gunpowder burns present. However! There is nothing of the sort around the bullet hole of this costume!
von Karma:
Aaaaaah! C-Curse you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You...!
Judge:
Hmm... I believe it has now been proven that the defendant was standing a ways from the victim when she was shot at. But do you think this has changed the defendant's situation...?
It doesn't change anything.
Phoenix:
(Hmm, even with that explanation, it feels like nothing has changed... But I can't give up just yet!)
Leads to:
"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!"
It changes everything.
Leads to:
"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!"
Phoenix:
Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything! The prosecution has claimed that the defendant was aiming to kill by stabbing. If that were true, delivering the final strike with the knife would be ideal. However! Where and what was the defendant doing at the time...?
Gumshoe:
...Squatting all the way by the folding screen...?
Phoenix:
Exactly. If Maya Fey was the real murderer, why would she be by the folding screen instead of preparing to strike?
von Karma:
Nnngh...
Judge:
Upon further consideration, it does make very little sense.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I figured there had to be a reason.
Phoenix:
Figuring things out and proving the logic behind everything is YOUR job!
Gumshoe:
Oof...
Phoenix:
(Alright! With this, the rest of the trial should be in the b--)
von Karma:
...
Phoenix:
(...blast radius of disaster.)
von Karma:
You are such a smart man, Mr. Phoenix Wright. To think that you've been able to take a completely hopeless case to this point... Now I know why papa had a tough time with you. Mmm, you amuse me...
Phoenix:
(Uuugh. Of all the things to inherit, why did it have to be that smarmy smile!?)
von Karma:
Detective. How dare you damage my perfect logic!?
Gumshoe:
H-Huh!?... How is it all my fault??
von Karma:
You can start repairing your standing by first removing that three-strand "goatee". Oh, and rest assured your punishment will come later.
Gumshoe:
...P-Punishment...
von Karma:
Well then, Your Honor, I think I've had all I can take of this Detective's face. I think it's time to call in the next witness.
Phoenix:
(Next witness...? That's gotta be Lotta!)
Judge:
Very well. The court will take a 5 minute recess. After we reconvene, we will hear from the next witness.
To be continued.

Phoenix:
Phew, that was a close one.
Maya:
I know you were giving it your all to defend me. But I could feel the death penalty hanging in the air...
Phoenix:
I felt like I was pretty close to dying myself...
Pearl:
But you were wonderful out there. You listened carefully, made theories, and tricked everyone into believing you.
Phoenix:
Th-Thanks. Wait... Tricked??
Pearl:
That must be the "lawyer's" secret technique, right?
Maya:
By the way... Is the next witness who I think it is...?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's Lotta Hart.
Maya:
Oh... Another jam, like always... Remember, Nick! You promised you'd save me! If you lose, my ghost will come after you with my sis', and we'll haunt you!
Pearl:
Your sister...? Um, are you talking about Mystic Mia?
Maya:
Yeah. Do you remember her, Pearly? My sister was a super good lawyer! She was also Nick's teacher.
Pearl:
...Oh, I didn't know that...
June 21, 11:43 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2
Judge:
Court will now reconvene. Now, the first order of... Oww!
von Karma:
I don't want to hear it, old man. After I call my witness, sit there quietly and watch like a good little boy.
Judge:
Y-Yes, sir.
von Karma:
Bring in the photographer who witnessed the channeling!
von Karma:
Witness. Your name and occupation, if you please.
Lotta:
Hey, Phoenix! How ya doin'?
Phoenix:
Just fine...
Lotta:
Sorry 'bout this. Didn't exactly have a choice, ya know...? Yeowza!
von Karma:
Name and occupation.
Lotta:
I-I declare! What in tarnation!? Hey, Judge! This here is violence against my fair self!
Judge:
That's fine.
Lotta:
"That's fine!?" That ain't fine!! That's a whip! Eaaah!
von Karma:
There's no need for foolish outcries from foolishly foolish fools. Just hurry up and testify about what happened on the day of the murder.
Lotta:
I haven't even gotten to say my name and job yet...
von Karma:
...
Lotta:
The name's Lotta Hart, paranormal photographer, and I'm here to testify!
Judge:
Now, now, let's all be one big happy family... OK...?
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
Lotta:
Only the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber.
We were waitin' outside the door and then, "bang!" we hear this gunshot!
Mr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room.
Inside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around.
I swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room.
Judge:
And did you take a picture of the scene right after the murder took place?
Lotta:
Reckon course!
Phoenix:
Eh? ...Excuse me?
Lotta:
Reckon course! It's short for "Ya reckon!? Of course I did!" Aah!
von Karma:
Does it look like I care? Just hurry up and show your picture to the court.
Phoenix:
(The moment of truth. What will be in that picture?)
Lotta:
Umm, let's see here... This here's the picture!
Judge:
Hmm... It would certainly seem that only the defendant and the victim were in that room.
Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.
von Karma:
Are you ready, Mr. Phoenix Wright?
Phoenix:
(I will clear all doubt about Maya through this cross-examination... Just watch me!)
Cross Examination
-- Witness's Account --
Lotta:
Only the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Was it really only those two that went in!?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
What are you blabbering about!? You were there too, were you not!?
Phoenix:
Urk.
von Karma:
Why don't you answer that yourself? Was it really just the two of them?
Phoenix:
...Yes. Dr. Grey and Maya were the only two who went into the room...
Judge:
H-Hold on! We can't have the defense testifying against its own client!
Lotta:
Anyway, folks, only the two of 'em went into the Channeling Chamber, ya hear?
von Karma:
But you knew that from the very beginning, didn't you? ...Witness, continue.
Lotta:
We were waitin' outside the door and then, "bang!" we hear this gunshot!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Was it really a gunshot!?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Are you insane!? You must have heard it as well!
Phoenix:
Urk.
von Karma:
Why don't you testify for the court, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Was it really a gunshot?
Phoenix:
...Yes. I think it was something that sounded like a gunshot...
Judge:
And why are we here listening to the defense testify!?
Phoenix:
(...And the world becomes just a little crueler...)
Lotta:
I heard a gunshot a long time ago, so I know. And I tell ya that was a gunshot I heard. Now, this -- this is where the story heats up!
Lotta:
Mr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, let me get this straight! This "Mr. Lawyer there" broke the door down!?
von Karma:
Honestly, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Why don't you tell us what happened, then?
Phoenix:
Um... Yes, Ms. von Karma... I broke the door down. Sorry. (Why does this feel like an inquisition?)
Lotta:
No need for apologizin'! That was great! You're a real man!
Judge:
Oh, really? That's something I would've liked to see.
Phoenix:
(The judge is smiling rather openly. I'll take that as a  good sign...)
von Karma:
And? What did you see once you broke in?
Lotta:
Inside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure it was the defendant, Maya Fey!?
Lotta:
Sure, I'm sure!
Phoenix:
(Lotta seems awful confident in her testimony...)
Press harder
Phoenix:
Lotta! Please, think back to that day one more time.
Lotta:
Wh-Whatcha getting' at?
Phoenix:
Remember what you said when we broke into the room...?
???:
...I was... murdered...
*klik*
Phoenix:
Lotta! At a time like this!?
Lotta:
Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!?
Phoenix:
When you saw the murderer at that time, you couldn't even tell if it was Maya Fey or not! Am I correct!?
Lotta:
Ah, um, well, ya see...
Judge:
Order! Ms. Hart! You are here to present accurate testimony!
Lotta:
Yeah, ah, s-sorry.
Phoenix:
(Good. This shifts things back to my side...)
von Karma:
For a defense lawyer, your defense is terribly lacking, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Phoenix:
!
von Karma:
Witness. Think back to when those two entered the Channeling Chamber.
Lotta:
When they entered...?
von Karma:
One of those people that entered the chamber was Maya Fey, correct?
Lotta:
Yeah, that's right!
Phoenix:
(Yeah... It was Maya that went in.)
Judge:
Hmm... It looks like we've come to a collective conclusion. The person in this picture is most certainly Maya Fey.
von Karma:
Exactly.
Phoenix:
(Rats! And I'm trapped like one... Again!)
Leave her be
Phoenix:
(Even I can see that any normal person would know who that was. It's no good. I shouldn't push my luck on this...)
Lotta:
I swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you absolutely certain of that!?
Lotta:
Sure am! But that old witch chased us out of the room, so...
Phoenix:
("Old witch"? Does she mean Morgan Fey?)
Lotta:
But there was no one else in there, and you know it!
Phoenix:
(The Channeling Chamber was very dark, almost pitch black... Was there really no one else in there? What about...?)
behind the folding screen?
Phoenix:
What about... behind the folding screen? Did you check back there?
Lotta:
Reckgiven!
Phoenix:
Huh? What in the...?
Lotta:
Reckgiven! Ya know! "Ya reckon!? That's a given!" I took me a good look around the room once! There ain't no way anyone was hangin' out behind that foldin' screen!
Judge:
Hmm... If I may have a word with you, Ms. Hart...
Lotta:
Wh-What? Ya got a problem!?
Judge:
Reckgiven!... I mean, I am having a little difficulty in understanding you. If you would stop saying such things as "Reckongiven" and so forth... Aah!
von Karma:
Now then, Mr. Phoenix Wright, do you see a problem with the testimony or don't you?
behind the door?
Phoenix:
What about... behind the door? Did you check there?
Lotta:
What do I look like to you? I wasn't born yesterday, ya know! First off, the one that bust that door open was you! With the way ya slammed that door, anyone standin' behind it woulda had more face and less nose, free of charge!
von Karma:
In any case, there was no one standing behind the door.
Phoenix:
(She actually had the police investigate that too!?)
under the flooring?
Phoenix:
What about... under the flooring? Did you check there?
Lotta:
I ain't no ignoramus to make it out here!
Phoenix:
Huh?... Wh-What are you talking about?
Lotta:
Don't "what are ya talkin' about" me! Under the floorin'? C'mon!, even a bug wouldn't crawl under that!
von Karma:
Sorry to disappoint, but there was no secret passageway under the flooring.
Phoenix:
(Oh... Yeah, that was a bit far-fetched, huh...?)
Phoenix:
(Argh! Her story adds up... What's worse is that I was there at the scene of the crime at that time too, and her story is exactly how I would have told it...)
(Pressing all statements leads to:)
Phoenix:
(Argh! Just as I thought, there is nothing wrong with her testimony! I was with her, so I know she's telling the truth...)
Judge:
Enough. It seems that there are no issues with Ms. Hart's testimony.
von Karma:
At the time of the crime, only two people were in the Channeling Chamber: the victim, Dr. Turner Grey, and the defendant, Maya Fey.
Judge:
Hmm... The face of the defendant can not be verified in this picture. However, if we think about the circumstances, it would have to be the defendant.
Phoenix:
(What am I going to do!? If I just let this go...)
Judge:
What is it, Mr. Wright? You look as if you have something to say...
Phoenix:
(If I make one wrong move, I'm going to have the judge against me... Is there anything I can present that would prove it's not Maya in that photo?)
Present evidence
Phoenix:
Your Honor!
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
It is possible that the person in this photo is not the defendant!
Judge:
Wh-Wh-What!? Do you know what you are proposing!?
Lotta:
Y-Y-Yeah! That's just plain fool's talk!
Phoenix:
(Thanks guys. Your show of support was just great...)
von Karma:
...
Judge:
...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof. Prove to this court that the person in this photo is not Maya Fey!
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Here is your proof!"
Phoenix:
Here is your proof!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
...
Phoenix:
Is there a problem?
von Karma:
Oh, no. I thought I would work on my inflections. Just wondering what an "Objection!" with a twist of "You're wrong!" sounds like.
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I'm sorry, but I don't follow your logic.
Phoenix:
(Shoot. I guess I wasn't showing enough confidence...)
Present another piece
Leads back to:
"...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof."
Give up
Leads to:
"Well, Mr. Wright?"
Can't present anything yet
Leads to:
"Well, Mr. Wright?"
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Nothing, Your Honor...
von Karma:
That's very smart of you, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You really should give up trying to prove this is not Maya Fey.
Phoenix:
(I didn't say anything about giving up! I just don't have the right piece of evidence to prove my argument...)
Judge:
That's enough!
Phoenix:
(I-Is this it...? Is this all I could do...?)
Judge:
I think it is quite obvious to this court that a verdict of not guilty is not possible.
von Karma:
I told you. Totally, 100% impossible.
Judge:
Ms. von Karma, do you have any further questions for this witness?
von Karma:
Having established the defendant's guilt, further questioning won't be needed.
Judge:
What about the defense? No further questions, I presume?
Phoenix:
(I... I couldn't protect Maya...) The defense... The defense...
...Phoenix... ...Phoenix, you can't make that kind of face... ...A lawyer is someone who smiles... no matter how bad it gets!...
Phoenix:
M-Mia!
Mia:
I guess I made it just in time, wouldn't you say?
Phoenix:
Y-You... But... P-Pearls!
Mia:
Her clothes ARE a bit small... Anyway, what are you waiting for, Phoenix!? Let's go!
Phoenix:
B-But how!? She's already taken away every advantage!
Mia:
The advantage is still in your hand! Think carefully, one more time, about what you saw in the Channeling Chamber. Do you remember what you told me yesterday?
Phoenix:
D-Dr. Grey!!
*klik*
???:
...I was... murdered...
Phoenix:
W-What!?
*klik*
Phoenix:
Lotta! At a time like this!?
Lotta:
Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots!
Mia:
You see... There is one final piece of the puzzle.
Phoenix:
Mia...?
Mia:
Question Lotta one more time, Phoenix. I don't know if she's doing it subconsciously or on purpose, but... she's not testifying truthfully.
Judge:
Now then, this court would like to end the cross-examination period.
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Please wait, Your Honor! The defense would like to request that the witness testify one more time.
Judge:
Overruled. I'm afraid you're too late, Mr. Wright. The cross-examination has already ended. Furthermore, any unrelated ques-
von Karma:
It's fine. I'll allow another testimony. A Von Karma's case is perfect. Absolutely flawless. And what better time than this for you to see that.
Judge:
B-But... I mean... I have some place I must go after this... Mmph! A-Al-Alright! I'll allow it! Ms. Hart! Hurry and give us another testimony!
Lotta:
Well... heck... What am I supposed to talk about?
Phoenix:
Please tell us once more what happened when you burst into the Channeling Chamber.
Lotta:
OK! You got it!
Mia:
See, you got through to the judge somehow, right?
Phoenix:
(Well, actually it was Von Karma's whip that got through to him...)
Witness Testimony
-- Witness' Account, Pt.2 --
Lotta:
When we broke into that room, all I could focus on was Maya.
I was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it.
I'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff.
But I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot!
Judge:
Nothing sounds different from before...
Phoenix:
(Some parts of her testimony were very vague. I should press her on those sections!)
von Karma:
Struggle all you like as you taste the bitterness of your defeat. Well, amuse me with your useless questions, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I'm waiting...

Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, what did she look like?
Lotta:
Ya know, she looked almost like a different person.
Judge:
A... A different person?
von Karma:
She may have seemed like a different person, however, she was still Maya Fey. We have already made that point abundantly clear!
Judge:
Yes, that is true... Well, then, Ms. Hart. Did you happen to see anything else?
Lotta:
I was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Then perhaps that body was not Dr. Grey's at all!
Lotta:
Eh!? W-Well... I reckon that's possible...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
If the body inside that room was not that of Dr. Grey, then whose body was it, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?
Phoenix:
Well, what if it was that of Maya Fey after the channeling? Or maybe -- Oww!
von Karma:
Foolish fool spouting foolish foolishness, just as I expect of a foolish fool such as you. If that were the case, then that would mean that Maya Fey is, in fact, dead. And that would make the defendant's chair quite a lonely place, wouldn't it!?
Phoenix:
(Urk... Sorry, Maya...)
Lotta:
Are y'all done here? Can I continue?
Lotta:
I'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff.

Phoenix:

And even knowing that, you still persist in being a paranormal photographer?
Lotta:
That's why I'm getting out of this here business. This gal's gonna get the dirt on the stars and be a tabloid photographer from now on!
Phoenix:
(She goes through jobs faster than a baby through diapers.) Wah!
von Karma:
Mr. Phoenix Wright. Would it kill you to stay on topic for a change?
Judge:
Well? Would it, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Nice, tag-teamed in stereo. Guess I should be grateful it's not in 5.1...)
Lotta:
But I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot!
Press
Phoenix:

"Two, right?"
Mia:
There must be something we can use in her testimony just now. We must find it! At all costs...
Phoenix:
Two, right?
Lotta:
T-Two what?
Phoenix:
Two shots. You took two shots.
Judge:
But... Only one has been submitted as evidence!
Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Where is the other picture you have been withholding!?
Lotta:
No, no, no! You've got it all wrong! It's not me! I-I didn't mean anything bad! I know I can be a little mean, but I ain't evil!
Phoenix:
(Well, at least she knows herself...)
Judge:
Then why have you not shown this "other picture" to this court yet?
Lotta:
Well, ain't it obvious!? That prosecutor woman told me to shut my trap about it!
Phoenix:
W-What!? V... Von Karma!!
Judge:
M-M-Ms. von Karma! Y-Y-You... You're hiding critical evidence...!
von Karma:

Phoenix:
(Unforgivable, von Karma. Suppressing evidence like this... You're as bad as your father!)
Confront Franziska
Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense asks that Prosecutor von Karma be held in contempt of court!
Judge:
Hmm... Well, yes...
von Karma:
Me? In contempt of court!? You can't be serious.
Phoenix:
But... But you hid evidence from the court... On purpose! That's... That's... That's not fair!
Mia:
P-Phoenix!! Are you a lawyer or a school child?
Phoenix:
(Ack! I was so angry I lost my composure...)
Leads to:
"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?"
Leave it to the Judge
Phoenix:
(...Argh! I'm so mad that even my throat's clenching up! I'd better let the Judge handle this...)
Leads to:
"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?"
Judge:
Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?
von Karma:
I thought this picture was not important, and thus, felt no need to submit it. That's all.
Phoenix:
H-How could you think...!?
von Karma:
The pictures were more or less the same, so why bother with the second? I mean, it's just so much more trouble than it's worth for me to submit this as evidence.
Phoenix:
"M-More trouble that [sic] it's worth!?" How... How can you say that!?
von Karma:
If you want to see it that badly, I'll submit it.
Lotta's Photo 2 added to the Court Record.
Judge:
... Wh-What is...? What is this picture!?
von Karma:
It's obviously the second picture the witness took that day at the scene of the crime. Well, it's a little off center. But that's what you get with a nervous amateur.
Judge:
Well, I think the important point here is the person in this picture! This is most definitely NOT Maya Fey! What is the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
(This might be the break I was looking for... Now, should I or should I not insist that the person in this picture is not Maya?)
Drop the issue
Phoenix:
... (It's no good. We've been through this so many times...)
Judge:
This is not like you, Mr. Wright! Why are you not objecting!? The person in this photo is clearly not the defendant and yet...
von Karma:
Ha ha ha... There is no way he can raise an objection and hope to live.
Judge:
Explain yourself!
Leads to:
"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture."
Insist it's not Maya
Phoenix:
Your Honor! As you can plainly see, the person in the picture is not Maya Fey!
Judge:
Y-Yes, I see that... It's not just her face! Her whole body has taken on a different appearance!
Phoenix:
There is only one conclusion that can be drawn, then. That somehow, this other person snuck in and traded places with the defendant!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!! Well, yes, I believe you are correct, Mr. Wright! The person who was inside the Channeling Chamber was not Maya Fey!
Phoenix:
Mia! We did it!
Mia:
...You're too soft.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Mia:
You're softer than Aunt Morgan's strawberry desserts, Phoenix. Take a look at Prosecutor von Karma's face.
Phoenix:
(S-She's... smiling...!?)
von Karma:
I think you had better continue to worry, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Judge:
M-Ms. von Karma! What do you mean by that?
Leads to:
"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture."
von Karma:
Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture. This was taken yesterday at the Detention Center's Visitor's Room. This is Mr. Phoenix Wright and the defendant, Maya Fey during his visit...
Judge:
Maya Fey? But... Isn't this a totally different person!?
von Karma:
She looks this way because she is obviously in the middle of channeling a spirit!
Judge:
It's unbelievable... That she can...
von Karma:
However, it is true. When Maya Fey is in that state, she physically changes into the person she's calling!
Judge:
...
Mia:
I wonder if she knows what she's doing...
Phoenix:
(M-Mia!)
Mia:
Taking pictures of someone during a private visit is illegal. That picture can't be submitted as evidence.
von Karma:
... Obviously, this picture is illegal. But I never intended to submit it as evidence in the first place!
Phoenix:
(Wh-What is she...?)
von Karma:
From the moment I showed this picture to the court, this case became all mine. After all, this image has now been forever burned into the judge's mind.
Judge:
...
Phoenix:
(I... I don't have even a single witty line...)
Mia:
It looks like we've been had.
Judge:
I don't claim to understand this, and I still cannot believe it... Are you saying that this person... this person is the defendant, Maya Fey!?
Phoenix:
(If I give up here, the trial will end! But... If I slip up and say something wrong, it will cost me... Is there any way I can prove that the person in this picture is not Maya!?)
I can't prove it.
Phoenix:
(It's no good! My argument doesn't hold any water!)
Judge:
I see the defense is staying silent on this one.
Phoenix:
...Yes... Your Honor...
von Karma:
And to think. I even gave you this chance to prove your point for free. But you couldn't even point yourself out in a line-up!
Judge:
Hmm... Yes... Well, then. I believe we have reached a conclusion.
Mia:
Phoenix!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
Mia:
You can't give up! Please, for me? Take a look at the Court Record again and try to find some way out of this jam!
Phoenix:
Yeah... Some way...
Mia:
The judge is about to close the trial. You can't let that happen!
Phoenix:
(Argh... It's come down to this!) Your Honor! Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now.
Judge:
What is it, now, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
Please! Please let me explain!
Leads to:
"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep."
I can prove it.
Phoenix:
Your Honor!
Judge:
Oh! The fire has returned to your eyes, I see.
Phoenix:
This picture... Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now.
Judge:
A contradiction!?
Leads to:
"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep."
von Karma:
So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep. Why don't you point out exactly what is so strange in this picture for the court?
Present left sleeve
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Please direct your attention here!"
Present face
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Please direct your attention here!
Judge:
...T-To her... face?
Phoenix:
With your own two eyes, you can clearly see that this face does not belong to Maya Fey!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Fool! Do you even know what you're talking about anymore!?
Phoenix:
AAAH! THAT HURT!
von Karma:
Didn't we just finish discussing that her appearance changes during channeling!?
Lotta:
I know you ain't no dummy, so don't think yer foolin' no one here!
Judge:
There is a limit to everything, Mr. Wright. And that includes patience!
Mia:
Phoenix! You have to think before you speak! You can't just blurt out any old thing.
Maya:
...Nick! You're supposed to be helping me!
Phoenix:
(*cringe* Even Maya's mad at me now... I have to focus!)
Leads back to:
"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The contradiction lies... Here!
Judge:
...You don't sound very sure of yourself, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Excuse me, but can you really tell me how much confidence I have in this!?
von Karma:
Hmph! What is with that attitude!?
Phoenix:
AAAH! THAT HURT!
von Karma:
Didn't we just finish discussing that her appearance changes during channeling!?
Lotta:
I know you ain't no dummy, so don't think yer foolin' no one here!
Judge:
There is a limit to everything, Mr. Wright. And that includes patience!
Mia:
Phoenix! You have to think before you speak! You can't just blurt out any old thing.
Maya:
...Nick! You're supposed to be helping me!
Phoenix:
(*cringe* Even Maya's mad at me now... I have to focus!)
Leads back to:
"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep."
Phoenix:
Please direct your attention here!
Judge:
...T-To the sleeve? But... But there isn't anything odd about it...
Phoenix:
And that is exactly what is so odd. Something that should be there is suddenly missing.
von Karma:
"Should be there"...? Aaaaah!
Phoenix:
There was a bullet hole in the sleeve of the defendant's costume! If that's the case, then it should be in this picture as well!
Judge:
Ms. von Karma!! Y-You... You intended to hide this valuable piece of evidence!?
von Karma:
...
Judge:
You will most certainly be assigned a penalty for this!
Phoenix:
(Alright. This should do some major damage to her argument...)
Mia:
Don't celebrate yet.
Phoenix:
You like to bring down the mood, don't you?
Mia:
Take a look at Ms. von Karma's face.
Phoenix:
(Argh! She's got that condescending grin plastered all over her face again.)
von Karma:
...Tsk, tsk, jumping the gun again, I see. Your Honor! I would like to extend an apology on behalf of those incompetent fools.
Judge:
Wh-What do you mean? And what "incompetent fools"...?
von Karma:
If those fools down at the precinct hadn't missed the bullet hole, I would have gotten a report about it. As I didn't, I could not have known that this picture was of any value to this case.
Judge:
Hmm, I see...
Phoenix:
(She's lying through her teeth! I know it! That woman knew about everything! The bullet hole, the picture -- everything!)
Mia:
But you can't prove that. Franziska von Karma's idea of a "perfect case" is quite fascinating, don't you think?
von Karma:
Your Honor. You need not worry. If you must assign a penalty, I'll personally make sure that detective gets what's coming. I'm sure there will be a great gnashing of teeth at the next salary discussion.
Phoenix:
(Poor Gumshoe...)
Judge:
In any case, this is a very big problem! When the defendant was taken into custody, her costume had a bullet hole in its sleeve. However, from this photo, it would appear that right after the shooting, there was none!
von Karma:
...
Mia:
The judge is confused by this strange twist of events. This is your chance, Phoenix! Load all you've got into this one shot, alright!?
Phoenix:
Got it! (Watch this, Maya!) Your Honor! There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!
This picture is a fake.
Phoenix:
The fact that the defendant's costume has a bullet hole in its sleeve is a fact! Which can only mean one thing. That this picture is a fake!
Judge:
Wh-What!?
Lotta:
Hey! You callin' me a forger now!?
Phoenix:
Well, no, not you exactly... Well, not per se...
Lotta:
Oh no ya don't! Don't you be scratchin' yer head with that goofy smile like some monkey! Now, why do ya think I'd do somethin' that nasty!? C'mon now!
Mia:
Phoenix! Use your brain for a change!
Phoenix:
S-Sorry, Chief...
Leads back to:
"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!"
The bullet hole was made later.
Phoenix:
There is only one explanation for why there is no hole in the sleeve in the picture! The hole was created much later, after the murder took place!
Judge:
A-After the murder!?
Lotta:
Hey! Those two gunshots we heard were before we broke in, or did ya forget!?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I-Is that how it went?
von Karma:
The pistol fired only two shots. No more, no less.
Judge:
You do know how to count, right?
Mia:
Phoenix! What are you doing!? Try it one more time!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Chief...
Leads back to:
"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!"
The shooter is someone else.
Leads to:
"The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it."
Phoenix:
The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it. However, this person clearly does not. There can be only one explanation. The person who shot Dr. Grey was not the defendant, but a different person altogether!
von Karma:
Wha-Whaaaat!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! If order is not restored, I will suspend this trial! Oww!
Phoenix:
Aah!
Lotta:
Why me!?
von Karma:
The defense's... The defense's argument is a complete mess!
Phoenix:
A complete mess? I fail to see how! Please, enlighten us.
von Karma:
Hey, witness!
Lotta:
Aah! What the heck!? Is that any way to ask a gal a favor!?
von Karma:
Be quiet you! You were the one who said it was only the two of them when you entered the room!
Lotta:
Well, ya know...
von Karma:
If you were lying, I swear that my whip will be the last thing you see!
Lotta:
L-Look, sis... You're lookin' mighty scary so why don't we say you... Waah! I-I swear! I wasn't lyin' or nothin'! There wasn't anyone else in there! Honest!
von Karma:
You see! Now riddle me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where did the defendant vanish to!? And where did this other woman appear from!?
Phoenix:
Umm... (Why is it lately, all I want to do is cry...?)
Judge:
Well, if the person in this picture is not the defendant, then this poses 2 very big questions. First, where did the defendant vanish to, and second, where did this person come from?
von Karma:
That's right! Now hurry up and answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright!
Mia:
Come on! You can't fall apart here, Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:
(I can't believe that even Mia's calling me by my full name... But... I mean... How am I supposed to prove something like this!?)
von Karma:
Had enough yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Or do you think you have enough in you to turn things around even now!?
Phoenix:
(To "turn things around"... That's right. Mia would always turn things around and change her perspective!)
Mia:
Phoenix...?
Phoenix:
(So, where did this intruder appear from, and where did Maya disappear to? I need to look at this situation from a different angle! Let's see... What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room... And what if Maya had left that room somehow... If I could prove that either one of those conditions were true...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you've come up with.
Phoenix:
I think what happened before we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber is...
a 3rd person had entered it.
Phoenix:
Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence! I have proof that there was someone else in the room before the murder took place!
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Please take a good look at this!"
Phoenix:
Please take a good look at this!
Judge:
...Okay...
von Karma:
I've already seen it.
Phoenix:
Thank you.
Judge:
And? What is the purpose of this item?
Phoenix:
Don't you see, Your Honor?
von Karma:
I don't think you actually see what you are doing.
Phoenix:
... *sigh*
Judge:
I think it is the court that should be sighing at you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ouch, that stung...)
Present another piece
Leads back to:
"Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence!"
Think it over again
Phoenix:
(I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...)
Leads back to:
"(What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...)"
Maya had left the room.
Phoenix:
Maya had left the Channeling Chamber at some point! And the defense can prove this!
von Karma:
Oh, how a foolish fool makes a foolish face while dreaming foolishly foolish dreams. Maya Fey was being looked after by her aunt, Morgan Fey. The chances of her leaving the crime scene is lower than that Detective's salary!
Judge:
Anyway, let's see some evidence. Prove that from the murder until the time of arrest, the defendant had left the room.
Present Black Key
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
The evidence you're looking for is... this?
Judge:
...
Lotta:
Why the heck is there a "?" at the end there for!?
Phoenix:
Well, actually, I'm not really sure about this evidence, you know...?
Judge:
Next time, only present evidence you actually do have faith in.
Phoenix:
(Oww... That burned...)
Present another piece
Leads back to:
"Anyway, let's see some evidence."
Think it over again
Phoenix:
(I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...)
Leads back to:
"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room..."
something I can't explain yet.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, but I simply can't.
von Karma:
Y-You see!? And the reason is quite simple. Because there is no explanation. That's why!
Judge:
Hmm... As I thought. Another big waste of this court's time.
Mia:
Phoenix! You can't just give up like that!
Phoenix:
But Mia!
Mia:
Rethink things one more time! There has to be an explanation!
von Karma:
I'm already "perfect". So of course, my conclusions are also "perfect".
Phoenix:
(Grr... Alright, Wright. Calm down and let's try this one more time!)
Leads back to:
"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room..."
Phoenix:
Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key?
Lotta:
Um... Well, I've seen it... Hey! That's the Channeling Chamber key, right? Before the channeling started, Maya locked the door from the inside with that...
von Karma:
The defendant herself locked the door...?
Lotta:
Yeah! That's why we all couldn't get the door open. That key's the only one of its kind, after all.
Judge:
Oh... One of a kind, you say?
von Karma:
...! Wait... Mr. Phoenix Wright...
Phoenix:
Yes? (It looks like she's catching on...)
von Karma:
I'm afraid to ask, but... Why is that key currently in your possession?
Judge:
Huh? What do you mean?
Phoenix:
If Maya Fey locked herself in, then the key should have been with her.
Judge:
Yes, agreed.
Phoenix:
However, she did not have the key at the time of her arrest!
Lotta:
Aah! Well, ain't that a kick! So how come you're holdin' it!?
Phoenix:
I got this as a present from a certain little girl. And that little girl was nowhere near the crime scene at the time!
von Karma:
Th-Th-That's preposterous!
Phoenix:
This means that Maya Fey must have left the room! If she had not, then I would not be holding this key you see before you!
von Karma:
N-Nooooooo!
Judge:
It seems we have come to an impasse. This picture has clearly captured the face of the murderer. However, is this person the defendant or not? The defense is arguing that this person is not the defendant. Furthermore, as proof, this key has been submitted as evidence. Ms. von Karma.
von Karma:
How. Can. This. Be!?
Judge:
At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant is not possible.
von Karma:
My perfect case! How is there a flaw in my perfect case! Don't think you've won yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright! I am a prodigy! I have never lost a case! And I don't intend to lose here in this courtroom to a fool like you! I don't care what I have to do... I will get my guilty verdict!
Judge:
That's enough! If you would like to continue, do so in the lobby. Court will reconvene tomorrow at 10 AM. That is all. Court is adjourned.
June 21, 1:32 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3
Maya:
Woooow! That was you Pearly!? You summoned my sis!?
Pearl:
Yes. I felt I had no choice...
Maya:
Great going, Pearly! I knew you were special! Hey, Nick, did you know?
Phoenix:
(...Umm, yeah. It's not like anyone else in there could have done that.)
Maya:
Hmm, Nick... I know you're trying really hard and all, but... I really don't remember ever leaving that room.
Pearl:
And I don't think that a third person... could have gone into that room.
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah... Well, at least we have until tomorrow to figure things out. Like, what happened in that room, for instance.
Maya:
Yeah. I'm counting on you!
Pearl:
Ah... I envy the two of you...
Maya:
Oh, by the way, Nick. Do you think you could take Pearly back home for me?
Phoenix:
Sure. Alright, Pearls. You ready to go buy some tickets?
Pearl:
Huh? A tik-ket?
Phoenix:
(Poor thing... So sheltered.)
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maya Fey...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
Game over
