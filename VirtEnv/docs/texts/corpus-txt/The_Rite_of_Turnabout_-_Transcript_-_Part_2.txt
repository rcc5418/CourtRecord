May 11, 9:40 AMHigh Court of Khura'in - Accused Lobby
Phoenix:
(I wasn't able to find any conclusive evidence yesterday. But if I can figure out Lady Kee'ra's motive for threatening the high priest, then maybe...)
Maya:
...Nick,  um... today, I... well...
Phoenix:
Don't look so down, Maya. I'm going to defend you with everything I've got!
???:
You would do well to cease this insanity while you still can.
Phoenix:
...As I said yesterday, I'm going to defend my client in court.
Rayfa:
Well, know this... You shall not witness a miracle of the sort that occurred last time. The moment she is found guilty, you, too, will be found guilty of abetting the accused.
Phoenix:
I never claimed to be a miracle maker. But I AM good at discovering the truth. And unlike miracles, the truth is always waiting to be found.
Rayfa:
The truth, you say? Hmph. Then it seems you have chosen your fate. This shall be... your very last trial.
Maya:
Nick...
Phoenix: 
...I'm going to prove you innocent, Maya, you'll see. After all, you have to introduce... ..."The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm" to the folks back home, right?
Maya:
...Right! I may be a defendant this time... ...but I'll be by your side like always, Nick!
Phoenix:
Thanks, Maya. This place is tough on lawyers. I'll need all the help I can get. Plus, it's always good to have you on the team! Well, it's time. Let's go!
May 11High Court of Khura'in
Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise
Judge:
Let the trial of Maya Fey begin.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Magistry.
Nahyuta:
........................
Phoenix:
Huh?
Nahyuta:
........................
Phoenix:
Umm...
Judge:
Quiet! Can't you see Prosecutor Sahdmadhi is absorbed in silent prayer?
Phoenix:
(Great. The trial's barely started and the judge is already mad at me.)
Maya:
He's very devout for a prosecutor.
Judge:
Hm? Why is the accused standing over there?
Phoenix:
Oh, umm... Well... Your Magistry. In addition to being the accused, she is also my assistant.
Judge:
The accused is your assistant, you say? ...Very well, then. A criminal does indeed make a fitting partner to a lawyer with a defiled soul.
Maya:
That ...wasn't very nice.
Phoenix:
Yeah, well, bad-mouthing lawyers seems to be a custom of sorts here in Khura'in.
Judge:
I must say, I am surprised to see you still here in Khura'in, Mr. Wright. And even more so to find you in the Hall of Justice once more. I cannot fathom why you would willingly risk your life in yet another trial.
Phoenix:
The answer is simple, Your Magistry: I am a lawyer, and this is what lawyers do. (Although to be frank, I'd rather be anywhere but here right now...)
Nahyuta:
........................... Such foolishness.
Judge:
Ah, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Are you ready to begin now?
Nahyuta:
Yes, Your Magistry. The prosecution is ready. Let us begin without further delay. But first, I promise you both this: I will cast your wicked souls into the fires of hell. Thus shall the soul of the victim attain salvation.
Judge:
Ha ha ha ha ha! Splendid! I would expect nothing less of you, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.
Gallery:
Please save the victim's soul, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi!Punish the wicked lawyer who dares to stop these last rites!
Phoenix:
I think I'll pass on that whole fire and brimstone deal. But I'm not surprised by your words or stance, considering what Apollo's told me about you.
Nahyuta:
So, it was you who instilled that putrid lawyerly guile within him.
Phoenix:
P-Putrid... what?
Nahyuta:
He, too, must soon face the fires, lest his soul be lost to redemption. But I shall send you on ahead, so that he will not be lonely when he arrives
Phoenix:
Sorry, but I'm afraid it won't be that easy. People say I never know when to give up! Nervous, Maya?
Maya:
A little...
Phoenix:
Feels like it's been ages since we stood side by side like this in court.
Maya:
Too bad I'm the defendant...
Phoenix:
Don't worry. We haven't lost a case together yet!
Maya:
You're right! Let's give this everything we've got, Nick!
Judge:
...Now then, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, would you please explain the case at hand?
Nahyuta:
Of course, Your Magistry. Let us begin the last rites of the victim. Maya Fey has been charged with the crime of murder. The victim of her heinous crime was high priest Tahrust Inmee. He was conducting the Purification Rite when he was brutally slain.
Judge:
And the cause of death?
Nahyuta:
Let us review the victim's autopsy report and the crime scene photo, shall we? The cause of death was blood loss from a stab wound delivered to the abdomen. The murder weapon was likely the Warbaa'd 
Dagger, which was used in the rite. However, the weapon has yet to be found, though the scene was thoroughly searched.
Judge:
A sacred relic used as a tool of murder? The Holy Mother's wrath shall be most severe.
Nahyuta:
The murder itself took place at the height of the Purification Rite. The accused had donned Lady Kee'ra's sacred robes. And the victim was there to offer prayers as a high priest of Khura'inism. During the rite, the victim and accused were the only two at the Inner Sanctum. Therefore, the only person who could have slain the victim is Maya Fey.
Judge:
Hmm... I must say, that does cast a great deal of suspicion upon the accused.
Nahyuta:
Indeed. Now then, allow me to submit this diagram of the crime scene as evidence in this case.
Inner Sanctum Diagram added to the Court Record.
Nahyuta:
In Khura'inism, slaying a priest is a sin most grave and dreadful. As such, Maya Fey's soul shall be plunged into the lowest level of hell -- the Hell of Tickling. There, she shall be tickled without end for 500 million years.
Judge:
That is a terrible fate indeed. Would the defense care to respond? 
Phoenix:
(And here I thought the lowest level of hell was the Hell of Back Pain!)
Maya:
I don't remember killing anyone, and I don't have that dagger or anything like it!
Phoenix:
As my client stated, she has no memory of the event as described by the prosecution. But more importantly, she had no motive to kill the high priest in the first place!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Hmph. I thought you might say that. Nevertheless... The meaningless prattle of lawyers is utterly ineffectual here in the Hall of Justice. For all will be made clear by Her Benevolence Rayfa Padma Khura'in's insights.
Judge:
So it is, and so it shall be. The Divination Séance reveals the truth for all to see.
Phoenix:
(Here we go again!)
Judge:
Bailiff! Please show in the royal priestess!
Gallery:
It's Princess Rayfa! Oh, how beautiful Her Benevolence looks again today!Glory to the Holy Mother for this blessed day!
Phoenix:
(As popular as ever, I see.)
Rayfa:
Rest assured, good people of Khura'in. I will defeat this murderer and her abettor. They shall not escape on their Freedom Express
Judge:
What a joy it is to have the royal priestess back in the Hall of Justice! May the Holy Mother grant us her divine favor! Ur dihara Khura'in!
Gallery:
Ur dihara Khura'in!Ur dihara Khura'in!
Phoenix:
(She sure looks pleased with herself... Especially for someone who didn't know what a "Freedom Express" was until yesterday.)
Rayfa:
Hm? Is there something stuck to my face, Barbed Head?
Phoenix:
N-No, nothing, Your Benevolence.
Judge:
Now then, Your Benevolence, the Divination Séance if you please.
Rayfa:
Very well... Nayna, my robe... O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination Séance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!
Judge:
The victim's mitamah has spoken... The Divination Séance is complete.
Phoenix:
(Great... Another clearly incriminating Séance vision.)
Nahyuta:
It could not be any clearer, O foul defense. The accused donned the sacred robes of Lady Kee'ra, and then attacked the victim.
Judge:
Oh, how very terrible it must have been. The figure of Lady Kee'ra lit against the dim lantern light... The scent of incense growing ever more potent as she drew near... One can almost sense the horror Abbot Inmee must have felt!
Nahyuta:
The facts as presented by Her Benevolence are indisputable.
Maya:
...B-B-But! Th-That wasn't me! Do something, Nick!
Phoenix:
I-I'm working on it! (That couldn't have been any clearer. Looks like I'm in for another uphill battle.)
Rayfa:
The accused committed this vile act during our ancient tradition, Purification Rite.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, the Rites Guide explains the multipart Purification Rite in detail.) The Transformation Rite... The high priest reads scripture, while a priestess dons the robes of Lady Kee'ra. The Rite of Water... Lady Kee'ra enters the spring, and the high priest purifies her, along with her dagger. The Rite of Fire... The priestess circles the sacred flames to purify her soul.
Rayfa:
Indeed... It would seem that the murder occurred during the Transformation Rite. The rite dictates that the high priest stand in front of the spring. Therefore, the accused must have attacked him from the direction of the broken lantern. Well, Barbed Head? Would you care to object?
Phoenix:
Of course. Because I know my client is innocent!
Rayfa:
Heh heh, so you say. You truly do not know when you are beaten, do you?
Phoenix:
(I managed to pull it off last time with Ahlbi. I'll just have to do it again!)
Judge:
...You intend to find fault with Her Benevolence's insights yet again? It would seem lawyers are pohlkunan creatures indeed.
Gallery:
Look at that pohlkunan! Pohlkunan! Pohlkunan!
Phoenix:
...Wh-What exactly is a "pohlkunan"?
Maya:
Someone who's a real piece of work, so to speak.
Phoenix:
(They can call me anything they want. The only thing I care about is uncovering the truth!)
Rayfa:
So, Barbed Head. Are you foolish enough to risk your life for your so-called truth? Because my insights ARE the truth! To deny them is to willingly dig your own grave!
Insight-- Rayfa's Insight --
Rayfa:
The victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra.
As the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly...
...he heard the accused's approaching foot- steps and smelled her incense-laden robes.
It was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed.
As his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world.
Rayfa:
...That is everything the victim experienced in his final moments.
Inner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record.
Nahyuta:
Dressed in the sacred robes of Lady Kee'ra, the accused rushed the victim head-on. The brutal stabbing she perpetrated could not have been any clearer.
Rayfa:
Yes, it is plain for all to see.
Maya:
N-No, it wasn't me! A sudden drowsiness came over me during the Transformation Rite. I didn't even get a chance to put on Lady Kee'ra's robes!
Nahyuta:
You waste our time with such meaningless statements, accused. You cannot explain away the truths revealed by the royal priestess's divine insight.
Maya:
Ooooh... ...How did you end up finding contradictions last time?
Phoenix:
The deceased's final memories include all five senses.
Maya:
Oh, you mean those words that appeared in the Pool of Souls? It looked to me like the bigger the word, the stronger the sensation was to the victim.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's how it looked to me, too. The sensations themselves are never wrong -- only their interpretations. That's why I tried to point out mistakes in Rayfa's Insights the last time.
Maya:
So, there could be contradictions between what Abbot Inmee felt and her Insights, huh!
Phoenix:
You got it. And I'm going to find them this time, too. (Should I check how to point out contradictions in Rayfa's Insights?)
Let's check, just in case
(I can switch between Rayfa's Insights using these arrows on the Touch Screen or D-Pad/Circle Pad ...)  (...while I look for inconsistencies between them and the sensations on the upper screen. Séance visions can be paused by touching "Pause" (L) on the Touch Screen. I can even jump to different points in the Séance vision... ...by moving the mitamah mark to a different panel or by pressing A or Y. When I see an Insight that doesn't seem right, I should touch "Select " (X). Then all I have to do is point out the sensation that contradicts with the Insight! The sensations this time seem to fluctuate more than the ones from Ahlbi's trial. In which case, I'd better keep an eye on changes in their intensity, too.)
I'm okay
Phoenix:
(Nah, I remember how it works. Still... The sensations this time seem to fluctuate more than the ones from Ahlbi's trial. In which case, I'd better keep an eye on changes in their intensity, too. Okay! Time to point out the sensations that contradict the Insights!)
Rayfa:
The victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra.
As the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly...
...he heard the accused's approaching footsteps and smelled her incense-laden robes.
Present Footsteps (Sound) on fifth panel
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The victim supposedly heard the accused's approaching footsteps. But did he really?"
It was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed.
As his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world.
Phoenix:
The victim supposedly heard the accused's approaching footsteps. But did he really?
Rayfa:
What nonsense is this?! Is it not abundantly clear?!
Phoenix:
No, it's not. Because there is something strange about those footsteps.
Rayfa:
S-Strange? Explain yourself, Barbed Head.
Phoenix:
The footsteps are strange because...
The timing doesn't make sense
Phoenix:
The timing doesn't make any sense! There shouldn't be any footsteps!
Rayfa:
There should not be footsteps as the accused was approaching the victim? Really? Then do you suggest that the accused was actually floating through the air?!
Phoenix:
Well, I mean...
Rayfa:
.........I suggest you hold your tongue.
Phoenix:
S-Suggestion noted. (If that's not it, then...) But there's definitely something strange about those footsteps. They're strange because...
Leads to:
"They're not getting any louder!"
They don't get louder
Leads to:
"They're not getting any louder!"
Phoenix:
They're not getting any louder!
Judge:
And why exactly does that matter?
Phoenix:
Please focus your attention on the incense the victim smelled. The scent grows stronger as the accused approaches. If the accused really had approached the victim... ...the sound of her footsteps would've grown louder as the scent of incense grew stronger!
Rayfa:
Ahhh!
Judge:
Wh-Why, that makes perfect sense! How can this be explained, Your Benevolence?
Rayfa:
Um, w-well... There must be a reason...
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
It is as they say... "Even a putrid worm of a lawyer will turn."
Phoenix:
(What does that even mean...?)
Maya:
He's not exactly singing your praises, that's for sure.
Nahyuta:
Still, we cannot discount this information solely on account of its lawyerly source. Your Benevolence... Perhaps you must listen more carefully to the abbot's mitamah.
Phoenix:
(Listen more carefully? What's he talking about?)
Rayfa:
Hmm... Yes, it would appear so. I shall try to refine the sensation.
Phoenix:
R-Refine the sensation?
Rayfa:
I can more accurately gauge sensations by deepening my communication with a mitamah.
Phoenix:
I-I didn't know you could do that. (Why have we never done this before?!)
Nahyuta:
By refining a sensation, a clearer picture of the truth can be discovered.
Rayfa:
O blessed mitamah, I beseech you! Hear me now and respond to my call!
Judge:
"Footsteps" changed into "bells"? What could this mean?
Phoenix:
(Bells? But the only bells at the scene of the crime were...)
Maya:
Ah! That jingling must've come from Abbot Inmee's bells!
Phoenix:
You mean those big things he had on his ankles?
Nahyuta:
Well, there you have it. The sound of bells was from the high priest's own footsteps.
Rayfa:
Th-Then that means...!
Phoenix:
If the footsteps belonged to the victim himself... It means it was the victim who was moving -- not the accused! The victim was the one who went running toward the broken lantern from the spring! A far cry from what Her Benevolence's Insight would have us believe!
Rayfa:
...Nngh!
Inner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record.
Judge:
But why would the victim have approached the accused?
Phoenix:
Maybe he was trying to defend himself.
Judge:
Please explain.
Phoenix:
He could've felt threatened by Lady Kee'ra standing there with a dagger. If so, he might have thought to overpower her before she attacked.
Rayfa:
Still your voices! This is nothing but a theory, and a poor one at that! B-Be not led astray by this lawyer's obvious postulation!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
While his insolence is inexcusable... ...I would ask that you calm yourself, Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
Is there something you would care to say, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
Even if it was Abbot Inmee who moved, it does not negate the accused's crime.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Nahyuta:
The accused was likely waiting for the high priest to approach.
Rayfa:
Ah!
Nahyuta:
And as he neared, she plunged the dagger into him. It is as simple as that.
Phoenix:
(Oh, right... It really doesn't change much, does it...)
Rayfa:
Yes! It is as the prosecutor has said! In fact, it is as I meant to say all along as well!
Phoenix:
(Riiight... And that's why you were so shocked when you first heard it.)
Rayfa:
Understand now, lawyer? That contradiction you conjured up has come to naught. Once I hone my Insights, it will vanish like the dying rays of the sun!
Insight Revised
...he heard the accused's approaching  footsteps and smelled her incense-laden robes.
...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the broken lantern.
Rayfa:
See? The fact that it was Abbot Inmee who moved... changes nothing!
Phoenix:
Arngh! (C'mon Phoenix. You gotta keep your cool. That contradiction I pointed out must mean something. That one sensation changed after Princess Rayfa refined her vision. It stands to reason that something else might have changed too because of the refinement. I should focus on any sensations that have changed... ...while searching for more contradictions between them and her Insights!)
Rayfa:
The victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra.
As the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly...
...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the broken lantern.
Present Water (Sound) on fifth panel
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Hold it!"
It was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed.
As his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world.
Phoenix:
Hold it! How do we know the Purification Rite was performed exactly as it was supposed to be?
Rayfa:
Hmph. That's easy. The customs governing the rite are very clear, and Abbot Inmee would've adhered to them.
Phoenix:
Well, that's strange.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain just what is so strange?
Phoenix:
Yes. I would ask you to consider the sound of the victim's footsteps. The sound of bells changes to the sound of water at one point.
Rayfa:
What's this?
Phoenix:
It's simple. The victim must have stepped in some water.
Nahyuta:
Oh?
Phoenix:
Yes. And the only source of water in the Inner Sanctum... is the spring. ...And therein lies the contradiction!
Rayfa:
Wh-What contradiction?
Phoenix:
I believe the rite started out as it should have. The victim stood with his back to the spring, and the accused stood right in front of him. But, we now know that the victim then moved into the spring.
Judge:
P-Pohlkunka! That is absurd!
Phoenix:
This means the accused's location differs from what Her Benevolence's Insight indicates!
Rayfa:
...Aaaungh!
Judge:
Th-Then, where do you propose the accused stood once she donned Lady Kee'ra's robes?
Phoenix:
(Based on the sound of the victim's footsteps, I believe Maya was standing here.)
Present Spring
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Until this moment, we've all just assumed..."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Judge:
Do you really believe the accused was standing there?
Phoenix:
Umm... Not when you say it that way, Your Magistry...
Judge:
Keep making sloppy statements like that, Mr. Wright, and I'll have your tongue!
Phoenix:
Please... A-Anything but the chop-chop...
Judge:
Then let's have an actual answer out of you. Where do you believe the accused was actually standing?
Leads back to:
"Based on the sound of the victim's footsteps, I believe Maya was standing here."
Phoenix:
Until this moment, we've all just assumed... ...that Abbot Inmee and Ms. Fey were standing where they were supposed to be... ...as shown in this rites guide. In short... The victim should've been standing with his back to the spring, and the accused in front. However, if that is how they were really standing... ...he couldn't have stepped into the spring as he approached her. The problem is, the victim DID step into the spring. This can only mean that Ms. Fey had actually been standing in the water!
Judge:
B-But if this is true... then their positions would've been completely reversed!
Inner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record.
Judge:
Wh-What is going on here, Ms. Fey! Were you really standing in the spring?
Maya:
...I-I'm sorry, but... I barely remember anything about the rite.
Gallery:
The high priest would never make such an obvious blunder during a rite!What on earth...? Is that even possible?
Rayfa:
That's enough!
Rayfa:
Be that as it may, this does not overturn my Insights!
Phoenix:
...It doesn't?
Rayfa:
Let us say the accused was standing in the spring. ...So what?
Phoenix:
..."So what"? This completely reverses their positions is what!
Rayfa:
That their positions differed from what is customary is rather curious. However, what does that change? It certainly does not erase the accused's brutal crime!
Phoenix:
..................I guess you have a point there.
Rayfa:
You lawyers are an absurd breed. Never thinking ahead, you cling to the first insignificant contradiction you can muster.
Phoenix:
Urk!
Maya:
Sounds like Princess Rayfa has a pretty good grasp on what lawyers are all about.
Phoenix:
...Oh, Maya. Where would I be without your brutally frank commentary right now. (Is this contradiction really meaningless? But something really doesn't feel right. Did I take a wrong turn somewhere?)
Rayfa:
Hmph. I will now amend my Insight to account for this new truth.
Insight Revised
...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the broken lantern.
...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the pool-side lantern.
Rayfa:
Now the contradiction is no more. But the truth of the matter still stands, no matter how stubbornly you deny it.
Judge:
What do you have to say for yourself now, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Nnngh...!
Maya:
N-Nick!
Nahyuta:
Your Magistry, this lawyer may have raised a trivial objection... ...but Her Benevolence's Insights have no further inadequacies of any kind.
Judge:
Yes... So it would seem.
Phoenix:
Wait a second! But there IS another contradiction!
Nahyuta:
Still you flounder about? Wretched beast... Though you rack that putrid brain of yours, nothing worthwhile will come of it.
Phoenix:
M-Maya, please tell me you remember something that might help us out here...
Maya:
Sorry... I really don't remember a thing. But now that the place I was standing in has changed, who knows? That alone may cause a new discrepancy with Princess Rayfa's Insights.
Phoenix:
(That's right. We now know that Maya was standing in the spring. A major change like that could very well produce a contradiction. I should take another look at the Inner Sanctum diagram in the Court Record... ...and confirm where Maya and Abbot Inmee were standing. And then focus on finding any discrepancies between their positions and the Insights.)
Rayfa:
The victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra.
As the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly...
...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the pool-side lantern.
Present lantern (Sight) on fourth panel
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Your Benevolence... I've found a new contradiction."
It was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed.
As his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world.
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence... I've found a new contradiction.
Rayfa:
You... You did? Hmph. No doubt it is but another of your vile attempts to slander my Insights.
Phoenix:
Nope. Take a good look at what the victim saw. It just might change your mind. The lantern flame behind the accused was flickering.
Rayfa:
There is nothing unusual about that. Especially as the wind had stirred.
Phoenix:
No, that's where you're wrong. If the accused had been standing in the spring... ...then what you see here should be one of the lanterns flanking the statue.
Rayfa:
I fail to see your point.
Phoenix:
My point is, something is wrong here. The two lanterns flanking the statue were both outfitted with glass wind guards. So neither lantern's flame should have been flickering in the wind in the first place!
Rayfa:
........................Heh.
Maya:
She seems pretty tickled, Nick!
Phoenix:
I don't remember saying anything funny.
Rayfa:
I fail to see what you wish to prove here, but... very well. I shall refine the vision and reveal the truth for all to see. O blessed mitamah, I beseech you! Fix your sight upon the lantern there.
Phoenix:
H-Huh? That lantern doesn't have a wind guard on it.
Rayfa:
And rightly so. For the wind guard was removed to reveal the sacred flame within for the Rite of Fire. Therefore, there is nothing odd about the flame flickering.
Phoenix:
S-Say whaaat?! B-But when we searched the crime scene, those lanterns had their wind guards on!
Nahyuta:
That's because the police put them back on. The sacred flames have burned uninterrupted for hundreds of years, defense. We could not risk them being extinguished, even during an investigation.
Phoenix:
Th-That would never fly back home...
Rayfa:
Well, Barbed Head? Are you done quibbling? If so, then it is time to bow down before this testimony of the mitamah!
Phoenix:
.........Arnghk!
Maya:
Nick...!
Phoenix:
...Don't worry, Maya! I'm just getting started! (All right, let's go over everything we know so far. Maya was wearing Lady Kee'ra's robes and standing in the spring. The high priest is thought to have been moving toward her. So I should look for sensations that stand in contradiction to this arrangement. I won't give up! I'm going to find a contradiction that will undermine the accusation against Maya!)
Rayfa:
The victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra.
As the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly...
...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the spring-side lantern.
Present broken lantern (Sight) on second panel
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"(Wh-What could this possibly mean?)"
It was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed.
As his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world.
Phoenix:
(Wh-What could this possibly mean? That lantern clearly contradicts the Insight... But this contradiction... ...will overturn the entire case I've been building.)
Judge:
Are you all right, Mr. Wright? One minute you shout out, and in the next, you fall silent.
Rayfa:
Perhaps it is like the bellow of one who is barreling down a hill with no way of stopping. Is that not right, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
..................
Phoenix:
(Don't get cold feet now, Phoenix. Even if this overturns the entire case you've built so far... ...the only way is to keep moving forward -- because that's where we'll find the truth!) ...Sorry, but I'm not barreling down a hill. In fact, I'm in full control of everything with the indisputable contradiction I found!
Rayfa:
Is that so?
Phoenix:
The lantern behind the accused clearly-- No, BLATANTLY contradicts your Insight!
Rayfa:
Does it now...?
Phoenix:
One of the lanterns on the entrance side of the Inner Sanctum was broken. And if you watch what Abbot Inmee saw in his final moments... ...you will notice that the lantern behind the praying form of Ms. Fey is broken. The lantern behind Lady Kee'ra, however, is still intact. In short, we are seeing two different lanterns in this Séance vision!
Rayfa:
H-How could this be?! And even if it were so, how would that contradict my Insights?!
Phoenix:
.................. Let me start by saying, the claim I'm about to raise... ...will overturn the case I've built thus far.
Judge:
Will the defense please explain himself?
Phoenix:
Based on the broken lantern, we can tell...
Maya and Abbot Inmee's positions
Leads to:
"Where the accused and the victim were standing!"
The lanterns positions
Phoenix:
The correct position of the lanterns!
Rayfa:
But did you not just explain that yourself?
Phoenix:
Oh, did I?
Judge:
The defense will own up to its own statements!
Phoenix:
(I'd better stop filling His Magistry's anger meter...)
Judge:
The fact that there was a broken lantern does not change anything.
Phoenix:
I beg to differ, Your Magistry! There is one thing it makes clear. And that is...
Leads to:
"Where the accused and the victim were standing!"
Phoenix:
Where the accused and the victim were standing!
Judge:
But did you not just finish asserting that the accused was standing somewhere else?!
Phoenix:
I did. And I built my argument on that faulty premise. But thankfully, it has led us here... ...to the actual spot where Maya Fey was standing!
Judge:
I must say, if the defense keeps changing its assertions in such a capricious manner... ...its credibility may come into question.
Phoenix:
I'm willing to take that risk, Your Magistry, because I believe this will be the last time. I'd like to start by pointing out the actual spot where the accused was standing.
Judge:
Very well... Show us where you now believe the accused was actually standing.
Phoenix:
(Based on the location of the broken lantern, where was Maya really standing?)
Present area between bottom two lanterns
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"I wasn't thinking straight before, but now it's all falling into place."
Present anywhere else
Judge:
Hmm... And you are sure it was there?
Phoenix:
Oh, uh, my hand slipped. Sorry, can we just say that one didn't count?
Judge:
Counting such baffling gaffes is my job, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Well, it was worth a try... (I need to think about the location of the broken lantern. That should make the spot where Maya was standing more than apparent!)
Judge:
O Holy Mother of Khura'in, Mr. Wright! You remind us yet again why lawyers are reviled. This time, see that you point out where the accused was really standing.
Leads back to:
"(Based on the location of the broken lantern, where was Maya really standing?)"
Phoenix:
I wasn't thinking straight before, but now it's all falling into place. We know the victim had stepped into the spring. That means Maya Fey had to have been standing in the water as he approached. However, his memory, which has only now become clear, reveals that... ...Ms. Fey was standing by the side of the broken lantern. In other words... ...she was standing where she was supposed to be according to custom.
Rayfa:
Rayfa:
Does that not bring us back to the very beginning?!
Phoenix:
No, this is where things take a different turn -- and I mean that literally. The victim had to have been moving toward the spring. That means that while he was moving, he had his back turned toward the accused!
Rayfa:
What's this?! Do you mean to say the victim turned around during the rite?! But such an image appears nowhere in the Séance vision!
Phoenix:
Actually, it does appear. It's just that no one noticed until now.
Judge:
N-No one noticed?! How could no one have noticed something so big?!
Phoenix:
There was a moment when the scripture the victim was holding was all we could see. Thanks to that, none of us could tell that he was, in fact, turning around in that moment.
Rayfa:
...Nngh!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
If it is as the defense asserts, then Her Benevolence's Insights no longer make sense. How do you intend to explain that?
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I don't need to explain anything, because it's just as you said, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Her Benevolence's Insights DON'T make any sense because they contain a huge error!
Rayfa:
...S-Such insolence!	
Judge:
A huge error, you say? Do explain.
Phoenix:
The huge error is...
The order of the rites
Phoenix:
The order in which the smaller rites were performed is all wrong! But there's only one way to tell. So let's ask for confirmation from someone who was actually there. Well, Maya?
Maya:
Sorry, Nick... I was out cold, so I don't remember a thing.
Judge:
...It seems there is no way to know.
Phoenix:
(Nngh...)
Judge:
But what I'm wondering is... ...what does the order of the rites have to do with this case in the first place?
Phoenix:
............Truth be told, I hadn't considered that yet.
Judge:
Consider the meaning behind this penalty, then!
Phoenix:
Consider it done, Your Magistry... Your Magistry! Please give me another chance!
Judge:
...Very well. But do not test my patience any further. Now, tell me. What is the huge error in Her Benevolence's Insights?
Leads back to:
"The huge error is..."
The crime scene
Phoenix:
The scene of the crime is wrong!
Rayfa:
But the vision clearly shows that Abbot Inmee was murdered at the Inner Sanctum!
Phoenix:
Could there be another place that looks just like it?
Judge:
...No, there can't.
Phoenix:
(Agh. If that's not it, then...) Your Magistry! Please give me another chance!
Judge:
...Very well. But do not test my patience any further. Now, tell me. What is the huge error in Her Benevolence's Insights?
Leads back to:
"The huge error is..."
The number of people there
Leads to:
"I believe this is what happened at the scene of the crime:"
Phoenix:
I believe this is what happened at the scene of the crime: The victim was reading a sutra when suddenly, he sensed someone behind him. He immediately looked back to see someone dressed as Lady Kee'ra standing there. Wishing to see who it was, he approached the robed figure. That's when he was stabbed!
Rayfa:
This cannot be!
Phoenix:
Oh, but it can. And it is! The Insight stating the accused stabbed the victim is wrong! And that is the real truth lying behind this testimony of the dead!
Rayfa:
Po...
Judge:
Po...
Nahyuta:
Po...
Rayfa:
Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Judge:
A- Are you suggesting... ...that there was someone else at the scene of the crime?! 
Rayfa:
Hnnnnnngh! Have I misunderstood... the voice of the mitamah... yet again? ...Th-This--! This cannot be!
Phoenix:
(Whew... That was a close one. But I managed to divine the true meaning behind the Séance vision somehow. I should add these new facts to the Court Record.)
Inner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record.
Nahyuta:
Your Benevolence, please allow me to take it from here. I will overturn the brash accusations of this faithless, putrid-minded lawyer.
Rayfa:
Y-Yes... I shall place my trust in you.
Judge:
Are you sure about this, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
My work as an international prosecutor has taken me to courtrooms around the world. And in that time, I have learned to perform last rites for souls in trials lacking a Séance.
Judge:
Yes, of course. Forgive my ludicrous inquiry.
Nahyuta:
Moreover, I have with me a forensic investigator from overseas. I will show you all the most magnificent last rites ever seen.
Phoenix:
(I guess he really does think highly of Ema and her forensic expertise. I'm impressed that he's come to understand their value. Then again... ...he IS an international prosecutor who's solved tough cases around the world. Time to hunker down, huh...)
Judge:
Now then, let us continue with today's proceedings. Could the defense please tell us who the third party dressed as Lady Kee'ra was? Your new claim has negated the Insights of the royal priestess... ...so I trust you have some evidence to support it, correct?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, of course. (This third party must have really wanted to 
kill  the high priest. I might be able to identify who it was if I had evidence of their murderous intent!)
Judge:
Well, we're waiting, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
The evidence that can reveal the identity of the third party... is this!
Present Lady Kee'ra's Warning
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Three days before the Purification Rite..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This piece of evidence tells us who the third party is!
Nahyuta:
Ah, yes. I suppose this evidence does clearly demonstrate one thing: The fact that you are lowlier than the lowliest of worms, that is.
Judge:
Even a lawyer like you cannot not worm your way out of this one, defense.
Phoenix:
Nngh, talk about opening up a can of worms... Your Magistry, I'd like to present another piece of evidence!
Judge:
Well, it seems the worm is not without a spine. Very well. What other evidence do you have for us today?
Leads back to:
"The evidence that can reveal the identity of the third party... is this!"
Phoenix:
Three days before the Purification Rite... ...the victim received a warning letter from an unidentified individual!
Judge:
He did?!
Phoenix:
Whoever sent it clearly meant to threaten the high priest. The letter said, "Do not perform the rite." But the rite went on as scheduled. I believe that is why the high priest was murdered.
Judge:
Who do you suppose sent that letter?
Phoenix:
A person with something to hide -- the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra herself!
Judge:
Peace! I-I... I don't understand. I had heard the Lady Kee'ra that has been in the news of late only hunted rebels. If so, why would she have killed the high priest?
Phoenix:
Excellent question. Maybe it would help to think of it this way: What if the high priest... had secretly been a rebel?!
Gallery:
The high priest?! He couldn't possibly have been a rebel!
Judge:
The high priest -- a devout follower of Khura'inism... a rebel?! Do you even comprehend the blasphemy of which you speak? Well? DO YOU?!
Phoenix:
I, too, found it hard to believe at first. But as I continued my investigation, it started to become more and more plausible.
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
The third party was the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra? And the high priest was a rebel? Your mockery of Khura'inism... No... ...of the Kingdom of Khura'in itself knows no bounds!
Phoenix:
(Whoops.)
Gallery:
That shameless pohlkunan lawyer...He's making a mockery of our religion!
Judge:
...As a faithful Khura'inist, I take issue with these claims. And I am loath to admit them into today's proceedings.
Phoenix:
(I don't like where this is going.)
Nahyuta:
The defense's claims are but vile blasphemy tantamount to spitting on the Holy Mother.
Phoenix:
I-Is it really that big of a deal, Maya...?
Maya:
Abbot Inmee was a distinguished monk, and very well-respected, too, so... yeah.
Phoenix:
(Ugh... Please don't let this turn into an international incident...)
Nahyuta:
But fear not, good people of Khura'in. The rantings of this putrid-brained lawyer who seeks to sully the soul of the deceased... ...shall come to no avail once I conclude these last rites. The prosecution's assertion that the accused killed the victim remains unchanged.
Phoenix:
B-But...the victim was stabbed in his abdomen! How is that possible when he had his back turned toward Ms. Fey?! Someone else must have killed him!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Are you sure about that? You may have invalidated the Séance, but do not let it go to your putrid head. The karmic flow of this trial is, as yet, still in my hands.
Phoenix:
(How can he be so confident?)
Nahyuta:
Heh heh heh... Something has occurred to me, you see. And your allegations of a third party are but a deluded fantasy. And I shall prove that by calling a new witness to the stand. ...An eyewitness who will deliver a definitive answer that will dispel the defense's doubts.
Phoenix:
A-An eyewitness...?
Judge:
Very well. Let us call this eyewitness to the stand.
Phoenix:
(It's him again!)
Judge:
Well, now... He has to be the shaggiest witness I have ever laid eyes upon. Please state your name and occupation.
???:
Oh, um... I'm, ya know, that so-and-so, whatchamacallit! A'nohn Ihmus TBD! 'Least that's what they've been calling me!
Judge:
"TBD"? As in "to be determined"? Can't you just tell us your real name?
Nahyuta:
The witness has suffered a blow to the head, rendering him amnesiac. Therefore... ...I named him "A'nohn Ihmus (TBD)" in my report, but he thinks "TBD" is part of his name.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You're letting an amnesiac testify?!
Nahyuta:
Have no fear. I have already questioned him at length. While it is true he has utterly forgotten his name and past... ...his memory of what he witnessed is still very much intact.
Judge:
Considering the dearth of information, any new knowledge may be of help. Therefore, I will permit his testimony. Now, Mr. Ihmus, please tell us what you saw.
Ihmus:
..................
Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --
Ihmus:
That night, I was up at the top of Mt. Poniponi, the mountain next to the Inner Sanctum.
I hate crowds, so I climbed up there to pray in peace.
I know it's a no-no, but since there was no one around...
...I used my binoculars to spy on the rite at the Inner Sanctum.
That's when I saw the accused... stab the high priest with a dagger!
Phoenix:
There's no way you saw Ms. Fey stab the victim with a dagger!
Maya:
I-I swear I don't know what he's talking about! ...Or don't remember, at any rate!
Judge:
Mt. Poniponi... the beautiful mountain that is also known as the Little Sanctum.
Phoenix:
(They must be talking about that smaller mountain from the poster...)
Judge:
Mr. Ihmus, I was wondering...
Ihmus:
What can I do ya for?
Judge:
The Inner Sanctum lies at a high elevation where clouds and fog can obscure the view. Are you sure you were able to see what happened from the mountaintop next to it?
Phoenix:
(Good point!) H-His Magistry raises an excellent question! Well, Mr. Ihmus?!
Ihmus:
On the day of the rite, there wasn't a cloud in the sky! I had a perfect view! If ya don't believe me, check the weather forecast in the paper that day!
Maya:
Nick! Don't we have the newspaper for that day?!
Phoenix:
Yeah, let's take a look. Hmm... It does say calm, clear skies, doesn't it?
Ihmus:
See? Told ya so!
May 9th Newspaper updated in the Court Record.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, it would appear the witness has offered testimony worth hearing.
Nahyuta:
...Mr. Ihmus. I, too, have a question for you.
Phoenix:
(Didn't he already question the witness?)
Ihmus:
Well, that's what I'm here for, right? Shoot!
Nahyuta:
How was the accused holding the dagger? Was she holding it underhanded, its blade protruding from the bottom of her hand?
Ihmus:
Yep, I believe she was! It's called a reverse grip!
Nahyuta:
Ah... I thought as much.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Hold it right there! What bearing does that have on this case?
Nahyuta:
Cease your interruptions, you putrid-headed lawyer. Do you not see the significance in how the blade was held?
Phoenix:
Why don't you enlighten me, O enlightened one?
Nahyuta:
Feh. I knew you were a fool. I can already picture you in your next life.
Phoenix:
N-Next life...?
Nahyuta:
Yes... After your soul writhes for centuries in the pits of hell... ...you shall be reborn as a witless sea urchin, with barbs limited to your posterior. You shall live a short, inconsequential life, only to be brutally devoured by a sea otter.
Phoenix:
(That was a bit excessive. I simply asked what the dagger grip had to do with the case.)
Nahyuta:
Now, pay attention.  How the accused held the dagger is of vital importance. With such information, we can infer exactly what actions she took. You were saying that the victim was killed while he had his back to the accused. Is that correct?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes...
Nahyuta:
As such, the accused's dagger grip tells us something very important: The accused approached the victim from behind, swung her arms around him... ...and plunged the dagger deep into his abdomen, using a reverse grip!
Phoenix:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Nahyuta:
Thus, Mr. Ihmus's testimony clears up any doubts that might remain.
Judge:
Ha ha ha! And it coincides with Her Benevolence's Insights as well!
Phoenix:
(This is a disaster! I thought I'd blown those Insights out of the water, but now they're back to haunt me!)
Judge:
Now then, the defense may cross-examine the witness.
Cross-Examination-- The Night of the Murder --
Ihmus:
That night, I was up at the top of Mt. Poniponi, the mountain next to the Inner Sanctum.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Are you sure you're not mistaken, Mr. Ihmus? Was it really Mt. Poniponi that you climbed?
Ihmus:
Oh, I'm sure of it! It was a really poniponi-ish mountain!
Phoenix:
(What does that even mean?)
Ihmus:
Ya know, now that I think about it, it was a mighty fine view!
Ihmus:
I hate crowds, so I climbed up there to pray in peace
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
If you hate crowds, why bother climbing to the top? Couldn't you have just as easily prayed at the bottom of Mt. Poniponi?
Ihmus:
Wrong, bucko! This is a once-a-year, epic event! I wanted to pray as close to the actual thing as possible!
Phoenix:
If you're so gung-ho about it, why didn't you go pray at the Plaza of Devotion?
Ihmus:
Like I said, I hate crowds. I wanted to pray in peace!
Phoenix:
(O Holy Mother, why do I only get the annoying ones...?)
Ihmus:
And my burning faith demanded that I climb up the mountain closest to the Inner Sanctum! Also...
Ihmus:
I know it's a no-no, but since there was no one around...
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Since nobody was around... ...there is nobody who can corroborate your actions, either.
Ihmus:
Hee-HO! Y-You're exactly right!
Phoenix:
In that case, Mr. Ihmus, let me ask you this: Was there a reason you didn't want to be seen?
Ihmus:
Uh... About that... If ya get caught climbing the surrounding mountains on the day o' the rite... ...ya can get in big, big trouble!  Har har har har har!
Phoenix:
...Th-That's it?
Ihmus:
Yeah, it's totally embarrassing getting yelled at when you're a grown-up! Har har har har har!
Phoenix:
Yeah, you're a real "grown-up," all right...
Ihmus:
And since nobody was around, I lost all inhibition and...
Ihmus:
...I used my binoculars to spy on the rite at the Inner Sanctum.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You had a pair of binoculars with you? That's pretty convenient. You weren't planning to spy on the rite all along, were you?
Ihmus:
A-Actually, I just happened to have 'em for bird watching.
Phoenix:
Bird watching, huh...? I see.
Maya:
You're not going to keep pressing him on this?
Phoenix:
He's sketchy as heck, but I don't really have anything I can really sink my teeth into yet.
Maya:
Oh... okay then.
Ihmus:
Haaar har har har har! I love the great outdoors! That's just the kinda guy I am! A guy called... A'nohn Ihmus TBD!
Phoenix:
..................
Maya:
H-He's... really starting to get on my nerves.
Ihmus:
As I looked through my binoculars, I couldn't believe what was unfolding before me.
Present Ritual Curtain
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Your Magistry!"
Ihmus:
That's when I saw the accused... stab the high priest with a dagger!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Did you really see what you say you did?
Ihmus:
Are ya saying I'm lying about this?! Well, I'm not! It's etched permanently in this old noggin!
Maya:
B-But, I didn't do what you say I did... I didn't even get a chance to touch the dagger on the day of the rite!
Ihmus:
Whadda I know o' that? All I know is what I saw! I've never even seen ya before in my life. What possible reason could I have to lie?!
Phoenix:
Urrrrrrgh...!
Phoenix:
(I didn't expect there to be any witnesses way up there.)
Maya:
B-But, I... I don't remember doing that at all!
Phoenix:
I know. I have a feeling the witness is lying. There has to be an inconsistency somewhere in his testimony. (I should take another look at the Court Record.)
Phoenix:
Your Magistry! I had my doubts about this bushy-bearded witness, but now I KNOW we can't trust him.
Ihmus:
What?!  You ain't just judging me solely on my bodacious beard, are ya?
Phoenix:
Not at all, Mr. Ihmus. It's much more than your sketchy appearance. It's your sketchy testimony.
Judge:
H-His testimony, you say?!
Phoenix:
Yes. Recall how the Inner Sanctum was that day. Specifically, that it was completely enclosed by the ritual curtain.
Judge:
Why yes! I believe you're right!
Phoenix:
The curtain would have completely blocked the witness's view from Mt. Poniponi. Therefore, he couldn't possibly have seen the murder happen!
Ihmus:
Hoo-hah...!
Judge:
Mr. Ihmus, have you been knowingly making false statements to this court?!
Ihmus:
Err... Umm... Well, uhhh... AAIEEEEEE! YA GOT MEEEEEEEEEE!!!
Judge:
The witness will lower his voice!
Ihmus:
I didn't actually see the accused herself!
Phoenix:
(He "didn't actually see the accused herself"? What's that supposed to mean?)
Ihmus:
Lemme set the record straight! I beg ya!
Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder (Amended) --
Ihmus:
I saw their shadowy silhouettes, projected against the ritual curtain!
The figures were created by the light of the full moon on that clear and still night.
She was just a shadow, but I could tell it was the accused, reverse-gripping that dagger!
Phoenix:
Sh-Shadows...? That's what you saw?
Ihmus:
That's right. I could see what was going on by the shadows projected onto the ritual curtain.
Judge:
In the future, Mr. Ihmus, I would rather you offer up accurate testimony from the start.
Ihmus:
Forgive me, my main man Mr. Magistry. Chalk it up to my fuzzy memory!
Nahyuta:
Though he saw but shadows, it is still valuable testimony.
Phoenix:
(You have to be kidding me...)
Maya:
Wh-What are we going to do now, Nick?!
Phoenix:
Umm... All I can think of is... ...to look for inconsistencies between the actual rite and what Mr. Ihmus says he saw.
Judge:
Now then, the defense may cross-examine the witness once more.
Cross-Examination-- The Night of the Murder (Amended) --
Ihmus:
I saw their shadowy silhouettes, projected against the ritual curtain!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So what you saw were simply shadows...?
Ihmus:
...That's right. Those shadow figures on that bright white curtain... They showed through plain as day. I could see everything that happened!
Phoenix:
But Ms. Fey and Abbot Inmee were at the top of a mountain, late at night. The only light up there was coming from four small lanterns. How could the shadows have been projected that clearly onto the curtain?
Ihmus:
No wonder people harp on you lawyers! You're always so dang skeptical! The lanterns weren't the only sources of light, ya know!
Ihmus:
The figures were created by the light of the full moon on that clear and still night.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You claim to have seen shadowy figures that were projected onto the ritual curtain. But did you really see them, Mr. Ihmus?
Ihmus:
'Course I did! The bright moonlight projected them onto that curtain, clear as day. It was like watching a scene out o' a horror movie from my front row seat on Mt. Poniponi!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I guess the moon does shine a bit brighter when you're way up there...) Maya, do you recall how bright the moon was that night?
Maya:
Umm... I remember there weren't any clouds, and that the moon was definitely out. But I don't remember if it could cast any shadows.
Phoenix:
Okay, thanks. (We can't deny that the moon was really bright. Which means it's possible that it was bright enough to cause shadows to appear.)
Ihmus:
Har har har har har! I remember it just like it happened!
Present Rites Guide
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"You saw silhouettes projected by the moonlight?"
Ihmus:
She was just a shadow, but I could tell it was the accused, reverse-gripping that dagger!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
How do you know it was Ms. Fey, if all you saw were shadows?
Ihmus:
It was that little bun on toppa her head! Didn't need to see her face. That distinctive bob's a dead giveaway! Never underestimate my keen sense o' observation! Har har har har har! Now that's one funny haircut!
Maya:
It's not nice to make fun of a girl's hairstyle! I like my hair this way! Besides! You're one to talk, you sasquatch!
Ihmus:
You're not into this wild, manly look I'm sporting? Shows what you know, little girl! Haaar har har har har!
Maya:
Nick...!  Isn't there some kind of a crime you can charge him with?!
Phoenix:
I-I'm afraid it doesn't work that way...
Phoenix:
Now he claims he only saw shadows? His testimony has sketchy written all over it.
Maya:
Then there must be an inconsistency in there somewhere!
Phoenix:
...Yep. (Was he really watching everything from Mt. Poniponi? If so, then I should see how his testimony lines up with the conditions of the rite.)
Phoenix:
You saw silhouettes projected by the moonlight? Sorry,  but that's just not possible.
Ihmus:
Wh-Whaddaya mean?! How's it not possible that it was totally possible?! That's impossible!
Phoenix:
(I think I'm going to need a "logicalese" translation on that...) Let's take a look at this rites guide, shall we, Mr. Ihmus? The rite is held "when the moon is directly over the summit of Mt. Poniponi."
Ihmus:
Doot doot doooooot...
Phoenix:
So if the moon was shining from the west, shadows would've been cast eastward. But Mr. Ihmus was standing to the west of the Inner Sanctum on Mt. Poniponi.
Judge:
O Holy Mother!
Phoenix:
That's right. Our witness here couldn't have seen any shadowy figures on that curtain!
Ihmus:
N-N-No... NO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY-HEE-HEE-HEEEE!
Judge:
Hmm... Perhaps it was the sacred flames of the lanterns that cast the shadows he saw?
Phoenix:
I'm afraid not. I inspected them during my investigation, but... ...the flames were too small to cast the crisp, distinct figures Mr. Ihmus claims to have seen.
Ihmus:
But...! I did see those silhouettes! Really!
Maya:
But how could he, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maybe he was someplace where they WERE visible...? (Wait... Don't tell me...!) Your Magistry! If Mr. Ihmus really did see those shadows, it brings a brand-new fact to light!
Judge:
And that would be...?
Phoenix:
The brand-new fact that comes to light if Mr. Ihmus really did see those shadows is...
He didn't see the murder
Phoenix:
He didn't see the murder!
Ihmus:
But I just told ya I DID see the silhouettes on the curtain! If you think I didn't see the murder, then prove it!
Phoenix:
I can't actually prove it, but my lawyer's intuition tells me you didn't see it!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, you shall have to do better than that. Unless you want more of these, anyway.
Phoenix:
(He's saying he saw the shadows from Mt. Poniponi, which I've shown is impossible. In that case...) Your Magistry.  If Mr. Ihmus really did see the shadows, there can be only one explanation.
Leads to:
He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder!
He was somewhere else
Leads to:
"He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder!"
Phoenix:
He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder!
Ihmus:
D-Doot doot dooooot...
Judge:
Oh? Then where do you propose the witness was?
Phoenix:
Someplace where he could have seen the shadow figures, naturally!
Maya:
Wait! You mean... 
Phoenix:
None of the mountains east of the Inner Sanctum are close enough for a good view. That leaves only one place he could've clearly seen the shadows from.
Judge:
...And where might that be?
Phoenix:
This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder.
The Plaza of Devotion
Phoenix:
He was at the Plaza of Devotion!
Nahyuta:
Do you truly believe Mr. Ihmus could see the Inner Sanctum from there?
Phoenix:
He must have really good eyes.
Ihmus:
Ooh, I do pride myself on my excellent vision! But still, you think I could've seen the Inner Sanctum with a big ol' mountain in the way?
Judge:
It's not a matter of good eyesight, defense. I must punish you for not seeing that.
Phoenix:
Argh... Should've seen that coming... (All righty, then...)
Judge:
You lawyers are a desperate lot, aren't you.
Phoenix:
Don't worry, Your Magistry. I'll get it right this time!
Leads back to:
"This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder."
The high priest's home
Phoenix:
He was at the high priest's home!
Judge:
And just how do you propose he saw those curtain shadows from there?
Phoenix:
Umm, the witness must be clairvoyant.
Judge:
Clairvoyant?! Is this true, Mr. Ihmus?
Ihmus:
Do I look like a psychic nutjob to you?
Judge:
...Not a psychic one, at any rate.
Phoenix:
(Well, at least the insult wasn't directed at me this time.)
Judge:
You lawyers are a desperate lot, aren't you.
Phoenix:
Don't worry, Your Magistry. I'll get it right this time!
Leads back to:
"This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder."
The Inner Sanctum
Leads to:
"Mr. Ihmus was at the Inner Sanctum -- just outside the curtain on the east side!"
Phoenix:
Mr. Ihmus was at the Inner Sanctum -- just outside the curtain on the east side! That's the only place from which he could've seen the shadowy figures!
Ihmus:
Hoo-haaaaaah!
Nahyuta:
.........Ngh!
Maya:
Really?! Wow, I didn't even think of that!
Judge:
But wasn't the Inner Sanctum off-limits to all but the victim and the accused?
Phoenix:
And the third party who was there, you mean. I get the feeling that's a subject Prosecutor Sahdmadhi would rather not touch right now.
Nahyuta:
.....................
Judge:
Ah, you mean...!
Phoenix:
That's right. This witness was at the scene of the crime. Which means he is the mysterious third party we saw during the Divination Séance. He could be the one who dressed as Lady Kee'ra and killed the high priest!
Ihmus:
Goo-geeeeeeh!
Judge:
Wh-Wh- Whaaaaaat?!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
No one but the two participants were allowed anywhere near the Inner Sanctum. And the only way up there are the stairs that start down at the Plaza of Devotion. So tell me: How do you propose the witness entered that sacred space?
Phoenix:
Oh, umm... He must've, uhhh...  (I haven't thought THAT far ahead...)
Judge:
The sanctum has sheer cliffs on three sides and a steep, towering rock face on the other. No one could have made it there by climbing the faces of those cliffs.
Nahyuta:
His Magistry speaks true. To say Mr. Ihmus was at such an inaccessible location is but a bid to tarnish his credibility. Is that not right?
Ihmus:
Right! I wasn't at the Inner Sanctum! No sir, no how! At least I'm pretty sure I wasn't!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
T-Then, what about those silhouettes you claim to have seen?
Ihmus:
I'm starting to think I've been imagining things! 
Phoenix:
What?! Th... This is insane!
Gallery:
I knew we couldn't trust that lawyer. He's trying to frame the witness!
Judge:
Peace! Peace, I say!
Phoenix:
(This is impossible! Unless I can show how he got to the Inner Sanctum... ...it just looks like I'm trying to slander Mr. Ihmus.)
Maya:
I believe in you, Nick! Rah, rah, siss boom bah! Fight, fight, Phoenix Wright!
Gallery:
Just look at the accused. Has she no shame?
Maya:
What's your problem, lady?! Phoenix Wright is very trustworthy, I'll have you know!
Gallery:
She's got some nerve for a criminal! I bet that lawyer poisoned her mind.
Phoenix:
P-Please, Maya, you're only making it worse. I appreciate the vote of confidence, but it's probably best to keep it to yourself for now...
Judge:
I would advise the defense to think carefully before making any more sudden outbursts.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Magistry... (If I wasn't the bad guy before, I definitely am now!)
Nahyuta:
Now, Mr. Ihmus. I would like you to think back carefully... ...before you testify next about where you were that night.
Witness Testimony-- I Wasn't at the Inner Sanctum --
Ihmus:
I was never at the Inner Sanctum, I tell ya!
That much I'm sure of, even with the fuzzy memory.
Besides, it woulda been impossible to get there in the first place!
Boy, you lawyers sure are scary!
Phoenix:
(I guess it might've been impossible for him to get to the Inner Sanctum like he claims, but...)
Nahyuta:
Now will you desist in trying to frame this innocent witness?
GalleryYeah! I'd like to see you explain how he got up there!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Is it not time to end these cross-examinations?
Nahyuta:
"A moment of desperation leads to 100 million years of torment." It means that for each moment a sinner spends struggling to deny their sins... ...100 million years of torment are added to their time in hell.
Phoenix:
(Khura'inism is the strictest religion ever!)
Nahyuta:
And just so you know, you've already accrued 200 million extra years.
Gallery:
Plus the 500 million years they started with... that's 700 million years of torment!
Maya:
Sure, what's another 200 million, give or take.
Phoenix:
(Well, it's a big deal to me! I can't keep saying that the witness was there at the Inner Sanctum... ...if I can't prove it. The problem is, how am I going to do that?)

Ihmus:
All I'm sure of is that you're deeply skeptical! Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, are all lawyers always like this?
Nahyuta:
Most certainly. They always try to pin crimes on innocent witnesses, without any proof whatsoever. They are no better than bacteria or viruses.
Ihmus:
Yikes! You mean he's contagious?! He's gonna give me... lawyer-itis!
Phoenix:
(Okay, this is getting ridiculous.)
Ihmus:
Whew, that was a close one. He almost put me there at the scene of the crime when I wasn't even there!
Ihmus:
That much I'm sure of, even with the fuzzy memory.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You just said your memory was fuzzy!
Ihmus:
I sure did. What's the big deal?
Phoenix:
I'll tell you what! Your testimony isn't very credible if your memory of the events is fuzzy!
Ihmus:
Oh, no worries there. My memory may be fuzzy, but I'm very clear on one thing!
Phoenix:
(Here we go again...)
Ihmus:
If you asked me whether or not I remember what I did that night, I'd say I do!
Judge:
In short, you are confident that your testimony is true. ...Is that correct, Mr. Ihmus?
Ihmus:
Har har har har har! Exactly! Guess ya don't get to be a judge for nothing! So, in closing, I can clearly say that I was totally not there!
Ihmus:
Besides, it woulda been impossible to get there in the first place!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Hmm... I wonder if it really was impossible for you to get to the Inner Sanctum...?
Nahyuta:
If you have something to say, just say it.
Phoenix:
Couldn't there have been another way to get there? A way that wouldn't attract attention?
Ihmus:
No, there isn't!
Phoenix:
(Which means, there is.)
Judge:
Perhaps the defense would share its theory with us.
Phoenix:
(I don't even have a wild guess, let alone a theory, though. Time to reach into my bag of bluffs!) To reach the Inner Sanctum without attracting any attention...
He climbed up the cliff
Phoenix:
No one would've noticed if he had scaled up the side of the mountain. He could've snuck into the Inner Sanctum that way!
Ihmus:
Har har har har har! The cliff face is all loose and crumbly 'round there. Even a pro mountain climber couldn't have made it up that way!
Nahyuta:
Everyone here in Khura'in knows that. But let us forgive the defense's ignorance -- he is a foreigner, after all.
Phoenix:
W-Why doesn't anyone ever tell me these things?!
Ihmus:
Tough luck, lawyer! I couldn't have gotten up to the Inner Sanctum by scaling the cliff!
Phoenix:
Arrrgh! ...Please add that to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus.
Add statement:
"No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!"
He came from the plaza
Phoenix:
Maybe you snuck up to the Inner Sanctum via the stairs in the Plaza of Devotion?
Ihmus:
Har har har har har! With all those people at the plaza?! I don't think so!
Phoenix:
But they were all completely absorbed in prayer. With a little stealth, you could've slipped by without drawing any attention!
Nahyuta:
I am afraid that would have been impossible. During the rite... ...the gate to the stairs was locked tight from the Inner Sanctum side.
Phoenix:
Wh-What?!
Ihmus:
Yeah! If I'd tried to force the lock open... ...someone there woulda noticed, even if they were deep in prayer!
Phoenix:
Nngh! ...P-Please add that to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus.
Add statement:
"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum."
He fell from the sky
Phoenix:
Maybe you fell from the sky?
Ihmus:
Har har har har har! The lawyer thinks he's a comedian now!
Nahyuta:
I was wondering what crazy theory you would propose next. Well, defense, let's hear it.
Phoenix:
Mr. Ihmus could've... um... parachuted down! We already know the weather was clear, and there was no wind to speak of. Perfect weather for skydiving, I'd say!
Nahyuta:
Now that you have been backed into a corner, your delusions grow ever more delusional. The Inner Sanctum is on a tiny ledge upon a sheer cliff over 2,000 meters tall. One misstep, and a skydiver would soon find themself in the Twilight Realm.
Ihmus:
Yeah! I don't care how still the wind was. Even I couldn't have made that jump!
Phoenix:
Wait! What's this building on top of the sacred mountain...?
Nahyuta:
That is Royal Penitentiary No. 4.
Phoenix:
(Oh, right. Princess Rayfa mentioned there was a prison up there.) How do you get your prisoners up there anyway?
Nahyuta:
By helicopter. But only with authorization from the minister of justice. He is the only one who can approve flights that pass over the Inner Sanctum.
Mountain Range Poster updated in the Court Record.
Nahyuta:
Might I also add, defense... ...that no parachute or any other equipment necessary for skydiving have been found.
Ihmus:
Are ya saying I flew down there by flapping my arms? I may be an incredible dude, but even I'm not capable of that!
Phoenix:
Arngh... Well, please add that statement to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus.

Phoenix:
You really couldn't climb your way up? Like, what if there was a route where the rock is more solid? Or maybe you're a celebrated rock climber. You know, something like that?
Ihmus:
As I said before, the rock's all loose and crumbly! And there's no route up there where the rock's more solid. Moreover, I've never rock climbed a day in my life!
Judge:
Any attempt to climb that mountain would be as good as throwing your life away.
Phoenix:
Aw, come on, Your Magistry...
Judge:
You continue to claim that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum. Yet said claim shall remain but a claim without any supporting evidence, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, I realize that, Your Magistry. (If I can't find any inconsistencies, guess I can always try to elicit some more testimony.)
Ihmus:
The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Who can verify that the gate was actually locked? I mean, what if it wasn't?
Nahyuta:
The high priest himself was seen locking it before the rite began. And we have many believers from the plaza who can corroborate this.
Ihmus:
Guess you struck out again, Mr. Lawyer Man!
Phoenix:
(What if there was a spare key to the gate? But I'm in no position to prove that, so... what now?)

Hmm... I don't see a way out of this. 
Phoenix:
Yeah, these kinds of debates only get worse if you argue them the wrong way. I'll have to pry some conclusive testimony out of him, and then present some evidence!

R-Right... Something like that.

Ihmus:
Well now, finally come around, have ya? Now you see that I couldn't have possibly been there at the Inner Sanctum!
Phoenix:
Right. ...If you didn't have any gear, that is.
Ihmus:
Wh-Wh-Whaaat on eaaaarth are you talking about?!
Phoenix:
(That overreaction is a dead giveaway that I'm on the right track!) Take a look at this piece of evidence!
Judge:
Those are prayer flags, are they not?
Phoenix:
Yes, but they have been sewn together... ...to create one big banner. A banner that could also function like a parachute!
Nahyuta:
Pohlkunka...!
Phoenix:
The people of Khura'in are so used to seeing prayer flags... ...that the police didn't even think twice about these flags during their investigation.
Nahyuta:
N-No, this cannot be!
Phoenix:
The witness landed at the Inner Sanctum by using these prayer flags as a parachute! Is that not right, Mr. Ihmus?
Ihmus:
There's no way out. I'm surrounded!
Phoenix:
Um... Mr. Ihmus?
Ihmus:
All this talk's jogged my memory. I-I-I guess... I guess I WAS there at the Inner Sanctum after all!
Nahyuta:
Grrrrrr...!
Phoenix:
As I suspected, there WERE three people there that night!
Maya:
You did it, Nick! You weren't wrong, after all!
Phoenix:
Um, thanks? Mr. Ihmus. You were the one disguised as Lady Kee'ra that night, weren't you?
Ihmus:
Whaaa...?! N-No way, no how! Uhh... It's like this... Umm... Oh, yeah! I was only there at the Inner Sanctum by accident!
Phoenix:
By accident?
Ihmus:
Exactly! And that thing's not a parachute. It's a homemade paraglider!
Phoenix:
A paraglider? Are you telling me you could fly using that patchwork mess of material?
Ihmus:
It may not look like much, but it's as sturdy as can be! I rode the wind like an eagle, going higher and higher from my earthly launching point! But then something happened that forced me to land at the Inner Sanctum!
Phoenix:
So you just happened to land there? You expect me to believe that?!
Judge:
Now, now. Please calm yourself, Mr. Wright. However, the fact that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum is crucial testimony indeed. And it certainly warrants further explication. Therefore, let's continue with more testimony.
Witness Testimony-- Why I Was at the Inner Sanctum --
Ihmus:
That evening, I was enjoying a trek through the night sky with my homemade paraglider.
But just as Mt. Poniponi was drawing near, something terrible happened!
An accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum!
As I landed, I banged my head, causing me to lose my memory!
So you see, I ended up at the Inner Sanctum purely by accident!
Nahyuta:
Mr. Ihmus, you failed to mention any of this during your pre-trial questioning.
Ihmus:
Can't be helped! I mean, I'm just remembering it now!
Nahyuta:
Continue such slipshod testimony and you will be cast into the Hell of Hangnails... ...where you shall have hangnails grown and ripped out for 800 million years.
Ihmus:
HOO-HAAAAAAH! ...I think I'll pass on that! 
Phoenix:
(Looks like that caught Prosecutor Sahdmadhi off-guard. This is my chance to rip his case to shreds!)

That's 'cause o' the ritual curtain! It blocked your view! You shoulda seen me, majestically soaring between the mountains!

Good question. Now what was it again...? ...Wind? Oh yeah, it was the wind! And not just any wind, but a sudden gale force wind. Made me lose control.

The wind was strong enough to make you lose control?

Ya got that right.

Okay, then. Please add that to your testimony.

Yep! Just the right amount o' wind for paragliding! So that sudden gale force wind was a real shocker!

Right! A paraglider's not much use without a decent wind!

Phoenix:
O-One thing at a time, Maya. First, I have to find an inconsistency. (But where there is constantly changing testimony... ...there are bound to be discrepancies and other issues!)
Phoenix:
We have a saying in my country, Mr. Ihmus: "One lie begets another."
Ihmus:
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
Phoenix:
It means someone caught lying will lie again in an attempt to conceal their first lie. In other words, this current testimony is just a blatant lie you're telling to cover your tracks!
Ihmus:
What did you just say?!
Phoenix:
You claimed gale force winds caused you to lose control... ...but this newspaper has the weather report for the day of the murder. It says, "The area around the Inner Sanctum will enjoy calm, clear skies today."

Your Magistry! The witness's testimony contains another flaw -- one that's even more fatal to his cause.
Judge:
More fatal, you say? The defense will explain himself at once!
Phoenix:
Mr. Ihmus claims he was flying up around the Inner Sanctum with his paraglider. But it would've been impossible to get all the way up there without any wind!
Judge:
Why, yes! I believe you're right! But we know the witness was at the Inner Sanctum, so... Mr. Ihmus! How did you get there?! And from where?
Ihmus:
...........................
Phoenix:
(Without any wind, he couldn't have flown up there from the bottom of the mountain. By process of elimination... ...the only starting point that makes ANY sense is...!) Your Magistry, I believe I have the answer to your question. To reach the Inner Sanctum, Mr. Ihmus must have launched himself from here!

Hmm... I fail to see how he could have reached the Inner Sanctum from there.
Phoenix:

Nahyuta:
You are a fool. Such an answer is no better than what a monkey might offer.
Judge:
Now now, let us not be cruel. Even a monkey could point out a more probable location.
Phoenix:
(Great. Now the judge thinks I'm lower than a monkey.)
Nahyuta:
So, the lawyer was monkeying around when he claimed Mr. Ihmus flew down from above.
Phoenix:
No, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. The witness DID fly down from above. With that in mind... To get to the Inner Sanctum, Mr. Ihmus must have launched himself from here!
Ihmus:
Hoo-hah! ...Are you insane?!
Judge:
Th-That's where he came from?!
Phoenix:
If he couldn't have come from below, the only other option is from above. So you see, A'nohn Ihmus came down from Royal Penitentiary No. 4! From there, he could have easily reached the Inner Sanctum by parachute! And that means he might have also killed the high priest!
Judge:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
Phoenix:
Mr. Ihmus! Were you the third party at the Inner Sanctum?! And the one behind the warning to halt the rite that the victim received?! Was it you we saw in his final memory?! Are you the rebel hunter Lady Kee'ra?!

Well done, defense. I must concede this point to you. The witness did, in fact, descend to the Inner Sanctum from Royal Penitentiary No. 4.

GAAAH-HAAAAAAH!

The witness is an escaped prisoner?!
Nahyuta:
Precisely. The police have been scouring every corner of the city to no avail. Meanwhile, here he was under our noses the entire time.

Hoo-haaaaaaaaaaaah! Didn't think anyone would see through my clever disguise!

Heh heh heh. But the witness's charade is not all that has been shattered. ...Is it, defense?
Phoenix:
(Boy, do I hate this guy...)
Nahyuta:
Please recall the defense's own words...
Phoenix:
Whoever sent it clearly meant to threaten the high priest. The letter said, "Do not perform the rite." But the rite went on as scheduled. I believe that is why the high priest was murdered.
Judge:
Who do you suppose sent that letter?
Phoenix:
A person with something to hide -- the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra herself!
Nahyuta:
He claimed that the real killer was "the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra."
Maya:
Yeah, and what's your point?!
Nahyuta:
What of the witness's true identity?
Phoenix:
Only a paratrooper, or more precisely, a former paratrooper, could've pulled that off. This witness is Datz Are'bal -- prison escapee and key member of Dhurke's rebel group!
Maya:
*gasp* Oh no!
Nahyuta:
He is a rebel and an escaped prisoner. He could not possibly have been Lady Kee'ra, mortal enemy of the rebels!
Maya:
Nooooooooooo!
Nahyuta:
...Now, perhaps the witness will enlighten us to the truth. After all, he has yet to refute any of this. 
Ihmus:
Hoo-haaah! Ya got me! I'm the razor-sharp fangs of the Defiant Dragons!

Oh, around the time you guys were talking about there being no wind. But ya gotta gimme credit for making up all that testimony off the top o' my head!

Are you prepared to tell us the truth now?
Datz:
Well, it's true I parachuted down to the Inner Sanctum...  ...but I banged my head on impact, and ended up unconscious outside the ritual curtain! In short, all my eyewitness testimony was a big fat lie.
Phoenix:
A big fat LIIIIIIEE?!
Datz:
Oh, and by the way! Long time no see... Yuty!
Nahyuta:
.........
Phoenix:
(Wait... They know each other?)
Nahyuta:
Your Magistry. This filthy rebel belongs in a jail cell.
Judge:
Oh, yes! Of course! Bailiff, seize him at once!
Datz:
Seems ya really have forgotten the will of the dragon, huh, Yuty. But I haven't. And no dogs of the Ga'ran regime are gonna lay a finger on me! ...Alley-oop!
Nahyuta:
Deploy all available resources! I want all units placed on high alert!
Judge:
The escaped prisoner... escaped again.
Nahyuta:
The police force has been placed on high alert. He will be caught before long.
Maya:
An escaped prisoner who's escaped the law again after giving a ton of false testimony... Talk about a troublemaker.
Phoenix:
He really pulled a number on all of us. (What was the point of all that, anyway?)
Judge:
Well, I can't help but feel that entire episode was an enormous waste of time.
Nahyuta:
...Your Magistry. Perhaps it was not as great of a waste as you might believe.
Judge:
What makes you say that, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
Datz Are'bal dropped something as he made his escape from these halls.
Phoenix:
(Hm? That scrap of paper looks awfully familiar.)
Nahyuta:
These appear to be direct orders from Dhurke.
Judge:
From Dhurke?! The rebel leader?! Oh, but we only have a small corner of it...
Phoenix:
(Wait, I remember now...!) Your Magistry, I've seen that scrap of paper before!
Judge:
You have?
Phoenix:
The scrap of paper Datz Are'bal dropped is a part of this.
Present Bloodstained Letter
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"And this is...?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Take a look at this. This could be related to the scrap of paper Mr. Are'bal dropped.
Judge:
Really? Because I fail to see the connection.
Phoenix:
I suspected as much. Okay, on to the next piece of evidence.
Judge:
One moment, Mr. Wright! We move on when I say it's time to move on!
Phoenix:
Arngh, can't you let it slide once in a while? (I better carefully compare the scrap of paper Mr. Are'bal dropped to the evidence I have.)
Judge:
I will ask the defense once more. Where have you seen this scrap of paper before?
Leads back to:
"The scrap of paper Datz Are'bal dropped is a part of this."
Judge:
And this is...?
Phoenix:
I found it at the scene of the crime. It appears to be a copy of the order that Mr. Are'bal dropped. If we put the two together, we should be able to read what the order says!
Judge:
Oh, my! And just what does it say, Mr. Wright?!
Phoenix:
..................... I can't read Khura'inese.
Judge:
Ah... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, if you please.
Nahyuta:
The ignorant lawyer has not bothered to learn our language? Very well, then... .............................. ...I do not understand.
Phoenix:
Well? Wh-What does it say?!
Nahyuta:
Using the lamplights as a landmark, he was to parachute down to the Inner Sanctum. Upon the rite's completion, he was to don Lady Kee'ra's robes and make his escape.
Judge:
What?! That is how he was to escape from prison?!
Phoenix:
(So, if I were to assume that Mr. Are'bal was the one who killed the high priest... ...then maybe it was because Abbot Inmee tried to thwart his escape plan...?)
Nahyuta:
O foul lawyer... I'm afraid that is simply ludicrous.
Phoenix:
Huh? B-But I didn't say anything. (D-Did he just read my mind?)
Nahyuta:
I know how your putrid mind works. Unfortunately for you, however, now that the rebel's escape plan has been revealed... ...it is clear that Datz Are'bal is not the high priest's killer.
Phoenix:
H-How can you be so sure?!
Nahyuta:
If only you would use that putrid brain of yours every once in a while. Datz Are'bal's plan could not have worked without the help of a certain individual.
Phoenix:
Wh-What do you mean?
Nahyuta:
I am speaking of Abbot Inmee, of course. Had Datz Are'bal simply donned Lady Kee'ra's robes and made his escape alone... ...he would have been far too conspicuous. But were he by the high priest's side... ...the faithful citizens praying in the plaza would have had no cause to suspect anything. It is, therefore, unthinkable that Datz Are'bal was the high priest's killer!
Phoenix:
AUGH!
Judge:
S-So then, you're saying...! The high priest was a...?! Oh, I cannot bear to say it!
Nahyuta:
I am afraid it is so. He numbered among the rebels who threaten our kingdom.
Judge:
How could this be?!
Gallery:
...The high priest... a rebel?Th-There must be some kind of mistake!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
...Let it go, and move on. Accept the truth. It is the only way. And that goes double for you, defense. Cease your futile battle now.
Phoenix:
And why should I?
Nahyuta:
Because I will now put the final nail in the coffin of the accused. Now that we have eliminated Datz Are'bal from our list of suspects... ...there is only one person that still remains: the accused, Maya Fey.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Hold it right there! Aren't you forgetting something important?
Judge:
Something... important? Please do explain, defense.
Phoenix:
We can't end this trial without looking into...
The arrow
Phoenix:
What about the arrow that was fired into the high priest's house?!
Nahyuta:
It was simply a means to deliver the warning letter to the victim.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...That's more or less the same conclusion we came to yesterday...) You know... I guess you're right.
Judge:
Oh? Then THIS should be just about right as well! It seems there is no need to continue this trial any longer.
Phoenix:
No, Your Magistry. There is still something important that must be brought to light!
Leads back to:
"We can't end this trial without looking into..."
The murder weapon
Phoenix:
What about the murder weapon?! We haven't found it yet!
Nahyuta:
What does it matter if it has been found or not? The fact remains that the victim was killed with it by the accused.
Judge:
I also fail to see how that would be important, Mr. Wright. This, however, is. It seems there is no need to continue this trial any longer.
Phoenix:
No, Your Magistry. There is still something important that must be brought to light!
Leads back to:
"We can't end this trial without looking into..."
The third party
Leads to:
"I'm talking about the true identity of the Lady Kee'ra we saw in the Séance vision!
Phoenix:
I'm talking about the true identity of the Lady Kee'ra we saw in the Séance vision! If that wasn't Datz Are'bal, then who was it?! 
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
That matter has already been resolved.
Phoenix:
It has? (What's he talking about?)
Nahyuta:
It is as I have maintained from the start. There was no third party in the Séance vision.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
B-But there was another Lady Kee'ra there besides Maya Fey! We all saw her!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Phoenix:
(Wh-What the--?! I... I can't do my finger point!)
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Hrnh!
Phoenix:
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
Nahyuta:
...It is time to let it go, and move on. Your fate has already been sealed, much like your arm.
Phoenix:
(Th-This hardly seems fair.)
Nahyuta:
It is quite simple once you consider where the victim and the accused were at the time. If the victim was near the spring with his back to the accused, what would he see ahead?
Judge:
Besides the water itself... there is nothing but the warbaa'd statue.
Nahyuta:
Precisely. The Lady Kee'ra we saw in the Séance is the warbaa'd statue draped in her sacred robes!
Phoenix:
N-NOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAY!
Nahyuta:
The accused wanted the false Lady Kee'ra to appear in the Séance vision... ...before she came from behind and stabbed the victim with the dagger in a reverse grip.
Judge:
But why would the accused want to do something like create a false Lady Kee'ra?
Nahyuta:
To show it to the victim as he was being slain.
Judge:
And what reason would the accused have to fool the victim she was about to kill?
Nahyuta:
It was not the victim she was trying to fool. ...It was this very court itself.
Judge:
Come again?
Nahyuta:
Suspicion would not fall on the accused if it looked as if another Lady Kee'ra was there. And the defense was foolish enough to fall for it and claim it was a third party in disguise.
Judge:
Are... Are you saying...?!
Nahyuta:
I am. It was all a cleverly wicked scheme, perpetrated by the accused. A scheme in which she sought to use the Séance vision to mislead us!
Phoenix:
(This can't be happening!)
Nahyuta:
What a face you are making, defense. I am surprised you are taking this so hard. After all, did I not clearly state a while back... ...that you were chasing after naught but a deluded fantasy?
Nahyuta:
Heh heh heh...Something has occurred to me, you see. And your allegations of a third party are but a 
deluded fantasy.
Phoenix:
(You're telling me he knew this is how it would turn out all the way back then...? And that he was just waiting for the most effective moment to spring it on me?!)
Nahyuta:
Heh heh heh. Do you understand now? I have had you dancing in the palm of my hand this entire time. 
Phoenix:
It... It can't be--!
Judge:
This is an outrage! You took our royal priestess's sacred Divination Séance... ...and used it to commit this most foul and despicable murder?!
Maya:
N-No! I did nothing of the sort!
Phoenix:
(Maya...)
Maya:
Nick! It's not true! I... I didn't...!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Cease this ugly display. Your fate is sealed now that the facts have been exposed. Your Magistry. The time has come to convict this criminal who only seeks to taint this sacred hall.
Judge:
Indeed. It seems this trial is over. 
Phoenix:
Judge:
Does the defense wish to offer up yet another counterargument or something?
Phoenix:
Umm... The accused is... uhh... is not the killer! And uh... here's why... (Now what do I do!? I've got nothing!)
Judge:
It would appear that the defense has run out of arguments to make.
Phoenix:
(I thought for sure that that rebel was the killer! The only person with a possible motive -- the one dressed as Lady Kee'ra -- has vanished. And I've got nothing to use against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's argument! Damn it! I can't lose now! Not like this!)
Judge:
Very well then, I shall now render my verdict.
Phoenix:
W-Wait! Please, wait! I'm begging you!
Nahyuta:
It is time to let it go, and move on.
Judge:
This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey... ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright... 
Guilty
Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Bailiff:Your Magistry! Please forgive the interruption, but...
Judge:
What is the meaning of this?!
Bailiff:
A body has been found in the Plaza of Devotion, Your Magistry!
Nahyuta:
...What's this?
Phoenix:
(A body? What happened now?)
Bailiff:
And we found this sticking out of the victim.
Judge:
Wh-Why that's... Warbaa'd Dagger!
Gallery:
Lady Kee'ra! She has returned from the Twilight Realm once more!She has come to defeat the rebels!
Judge:
Peace!
Nahyuta:
Well, it would seem the dagger that was once lost has now been found.
Bailiff:
I have one more thing to report, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi!
Nahyuta:
Yes?
Bailiff:
This dagger... It bears the fingerprints of Maya Fey on it!
Phoenix:
WHA-HAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Maya:
B-But...
Phoenix:
(Why would Maya's prints be on it?)
Nahyuta:
.............................. I cannot believe it, yet it must be true...
Judge:
Is something the matter, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
This trial has run its course, and the accused's guilt has been firmly established. However... ...it would seem the defense was right about one thing. You claimed that the murder at the Inner Sanctum... ...had been carried out by the rebel hunter masquerading as Lady Kee'ra.
Phoenix:
I did say something to that effect, but what of it?
Judge:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! A-Are you suggesting what I think you are?
Nahyuta:
I believe the true identity of the rebel hunter who has been masquerading as Lady Kee'ra... ...is none other than the accused, Ms. Maya Fey!
Phoenix:
Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat?!
Maya:
Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?!
Judge:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
Nahyuta:
I realize how shocking this must seem. Looking back, however, I now realize there was much that pointed to this fact. The rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra was first sighted about two years ago. And the accused first came to our kingdom two years ago as well.
Judge:
Wh-Why, the timing matches perfectly!
Nahyuta:
But there is more... That warning letter was found in the high priest's bedroom three days before the rite. Despite his house being locked up tight that night.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
How does that prove anything?!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
It is difficult to believe an intruder could have found a way to enter such a secure house. However, the accused was known to come and go freely there. ...Mainly to prepare for the Purification Rite.
Phoenix:
Ah!
Maya:
Abbot Inmee was an important figure with a ton of duties, including training acolytes. He was really kind, even to a foreigner like me. He even invited me over to his house whenever I was between training sessions.
Nahyuta:
The accused could have easily left the house unlocked for herself without anyone noticing.
Phoenix:
Nooooooooooooooo!
Lady Kee'ra's Warning updated in the Court Record.
Nahyuta:
If we assume that the accused was Lady Kee'ra... ...that more than establishes her motive for killing the high priest.
Judge:
Yes, the victim was secretly an insurgent, bent on helping Datz Are'bal escape, after all.
Nahyuta:
Precisely. That made him a target of Lady Kee'ra's wrath. And after killing the high priest, she then unleashed her divine justice on another rebel. So, it seems the scope of this case has expanded. We now have... two murders perpetrated by Ms. Maya Fey, masquerading as Lady Kee'ra.
Judge:
.................. If Ms. Fey is indeed a serial killer, it would affect the severity of her punishment. In light of this, I believe this second murder must be investigated before we can proceed.
Nahyuta:
As you wish, Your Magistry. Maya Fey, I hereby charge you with this second murder. May your defiled soul feel the weight of your sins.
Phoenix:
(A new murder charge on top of a guilty verdict?)
Judge:
It seems the defense will live to see one more day.
Phoenix:
(Talk about "hanging on by a thread"...)
Nahyuta:
Heh heh heh. Come tomorrow, a far more terrible punishment awaits you.
Judge:
I hereby suspend these proceedings so that the second murder may be investigated. Until the conclusion of this new investigation, this court is adjourned!
To Be Continued
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That statement is inconsistent with this piece of evidence.
Nahyuta:
Let it go, and move on. Abandon this folly. You know very well your evidence proves nothing.
Phoenix:
Nice try, but you can't make me give up. I'm going to prove I'm right!
Judge:
You can point your finger as much as you want, but you're simply wasting your time. It is a pitiful sight to see a lawyer who doesn't know when he is beat.
Phoenix: 
(Argh... I just need to hang in there a little longer.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Please take a look at this piece of evidence. Anything come to mind?
Nahyuta:
............
Judge:
............
Phoenix:
W-Well...?
Judge:
Hm? Did the defense have something he would like to say?
Phoenix:
(That fell on deaf ears.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Judge:
Is something the matter?
Phoenix:
Sorry. That scream just sort of slipped out.
Judge:
I don't know about trials in your country, but we refrain from such rash outbursts here. Perhaps this will deter any future urges you might have.
Phoenix:
(I'm not helping my case in the judge's eyes, both literally and figuratively.)
Presenting incorrect sensation or Insight during Divination Séance (on initial Insight)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence! isn't this statement inconsistent with the vision?
Rayfa:
Inconsistent...?
Phoenix:
Exactly! That's where the inconsistency lies!
Judge:
No, I believe it is in the defense's thought process that the inconsistency lies.
Phoenix:
(Argh. Guess there wasn't an inconsistency there after all...)
Maya:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
What is it, Maya?
Maya:
I'm... still trying to figure this whole Insight thing out. When the words change size... ...that means the intensity of those sensations is changing, too, right?
Phoenix:
That's what it looks like to me.
Maya:
So then... that's probably something we should keep an eye on, too. In short, we should be on the lookout for... ...changes that shouldn't take place, but they do anyway... ...and changes that don't occur when they should.
Phoenix:
How very perceptive of you. (I guess all that training's sharpened Maya's mind along with her powers.)
Phoenix:
Let's compare the vision to the Insights, while looking for changes in sensory intensity!
Maya:
Sounds like a plan!
Presenting incorrect sensation or Insight during Divination Séance (on all revised Insights)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence! isn't this statement inconsistent with the vision?
Rayfa:
Inconsistent...?
Phoenix:
Exactly! That's where the inconsistency lies!
Judge:
No, I believe it is in the defense's thought process that the inconsistency lies.
Phoenix:
(Argh. Guess there wasn't an inconsistency there after all...)
Consult (during a cross-examination, when evidence must be presented)
Maya:
Looks like you can't count on your bluffing skills to save your butt this time.
Phoenix:
Yeah... This is a tough one.
Maya:
Well, to me, there's something about this one statement that seems off.
Phoenix:
Yeah, it does sound a little strange, doesn't it? Thanks, Maya. I'll take another look at the evidence.
Maya:
You can always count on me!
Consult (during a cross-examination, when statements must be pressed)
Maya:
You're looking a little pale there, Nick. Are you all right?
Phoenix:
This trial is really putting me through the wringer.
Maya:
Maybe it's just a matter of getting the information you need.
Phoenix:
Right... Thanks, Maya. (Guess I'd better keep pressing, then!)
Maya:
Once you get more info, you can use it to make one of your famous bluffs!
Phoenix:
(She makes it sound like bluffing is my default move.)
Consult (during a Divination Séance, on initial Insight)
Maya:
What's wrong, Nick?
Phoenix:
Um, I'm having a tough time spotting a contradiction.
Maya:
Well, there was one sensation that caught my eye. You know that footsteps sensation? Didn't something about it seem strange to you?
Phoenix:
Now that you mention it... Thanks. I'll focus on that as I review the Insights.
Consult (during a Divination Séance, on first revised Insight)
Maya:
You're making that "I-can't-find-a-contradiction" face of yours again, Nick.
Phoenix:
Yeah, well... I'm kinda clutching at straws here.
Maya:
And I think we should focus on the sound of bells that were just uncovered.
Phoenix:
You're right. Let's focus on that sensation and take another look at Rayfa's Insights.
Consult (during a Divination Séance, on second revised Insight)
Maya:
You look like you're having a tough time, Nick.
Phoenix:
Yeah, because I can't find any contradictions. I mean, the sensations in the vision all seem perfectly fine to me...
Maya:
In that case, why don't you read the Insights while focusing on what the victim saw?
Phoenix:
(Of course! His sense of sight! Time to go over those Insights again!)
Consult (during a Divination Séance, on third revised Insight)
Phoenix:
Maya... I can't find any contradictions.
Maya:
Come on, Nick. A bit early to throw in the towel, don't you think?
Phoenix:
But I didn't notice anything wrong with the sensations that appeared as words just now.
Maya:
Well then, maybe the contradiction is in what Abbot Inmee saw. I think there's something fishy about the things that we can more clearly see now. Also... We should focus on not only the sensations, but the updated Insights, as well.
Phoenix:
Right. Thanks, Maya!
Too many penalties
Judge:
This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey... ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright... 
Guilty
