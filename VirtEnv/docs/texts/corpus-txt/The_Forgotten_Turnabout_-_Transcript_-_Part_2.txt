Part 1
Part 2
April 5, 7:06 PM?????????
Ray:
It's pretty dark down here... I can't see a thing!
Edgeworth:
Watch your footing, Ema.
Ema:
Ouch! I think I hit my head...
Edgeworth:
Kay, be careful not to slip. Take your time coming down.
Kay:
Ah... OK!
Ray:
Hmmm... The light switch should be somewhere around here!
Edgeworth:
Th... This is! (The hidden 51st floor... Is it being used as a storeroom? We'll need to investigate it thoroughly.)
Grand Tower Pamphlet data updated in my Organizer.
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth! Please tell me about the case!
Edgeworth:
Right then, where should I begin...?
Ema:
I see... This is certainly a serious situation!
Edgeworth:
(Why does she look like she's having so much fun...)
Ema:
Heh heh heh... looks like you're in a bind, Prosecutorial Attorney Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...I'm not a defense attorney. Nor is there such thing as a "Prosecutorial Attorney."
Ema:
This looks like a job for science! Don't worry. I've got everything here in my bag.
Edgeworth:
Are you sure you're up for this, Ema?
Ema:
Of course! So, once again... ...it's good to be working with you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
And I'm glad to be working with you, as well.
Ray:
Looks like we've got ourselves another cute assistant. ...So, what's the plan?
Ema:
That lift looks pretty suspicious to me!
Ray:
It... looks like it goes down?
Edgeworth:
I am curious as well... But first, we should investigate this room.
Ray:
OK. If you find out anything, be sure to tell Uncle Ray.
Kay:
And if I remember something, I'll let you know.
Edgeworth:
Yes, please do. ...Ema.
Ema:
Roger! I'm ready to support!
Edgeworth:
Well then... let's begin the investigation.
Begin Investigation
Grand Tower51st Floor Storeroom
Logic
"Prices" and "Big bucks"
Edgeworth:
From the price tags attached to the pieces of evidence, and that huge stash of cash... ...it's clear that buying and selling of evidence was being carried out here.
Ema:
In the hidden 51st floor, evidence was being trafficked! This clearly means something!
Edgeworth:
It seems further investigation is needed... ...about the dealings that went on in this place.
Ema:
If only there was a witness, we could just ask them.
Edgeworth:
(A witness...?)
Partner
Ema:
Ask me anything you want!
Notice anything?
Ema:
Since Kay's the suspect, I can't just stay silent!
Edgeworth:
I feel the same way. For now, we should calm down and search for clues.
Ema:
...No. After thinking it through scientifically, I've come up with an even better plan! I'll just give Kay an extremely powerful electric shock to her head... ...and see if that will jump start her memories!
Edgeworth:
Umm... W-Well. That seems a bit, no, quite dangerous. I would prefer to go with my proposal to calm down and investigate this room.
Ema:
Is that so? But in science, a bit of danger always comes with the territory...
Edgeworth:
(That's not exactly what you would call "a bit of danger"!)
Ema Skye
Ema:
I came back here for a while as my teacher's translator, but normally I study in Europe. That's right! To become a super forensic scientist!
Edgeworth:
That's admirable. Endeavoring to learn is the duty of a student.
Ema:
Yes! In order to excel in both academics and athletics, I've even taken up sports. For example, the competitions they have during Sports Day!
Edgeworth:
(...Oh? I wonder what sort of competitions she's referring to?)
Ema:
Unlike America, Europe has extremely tough, manly sports, and... Well, I'm sure you've heard of the "War of the Eyeglasses" at least.
Edgeworth:
(I've never heard of it before in my life...)
Present
Yatagarasu's Badge
Ema:
This is Kay's badge, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. This is her precious badge. ...Though she doesn't seem to remember it herself.
Ema:
Is that so...? Hmm. Maybe it doesn't have enough impact? How about I customize that badge a bit? Let's spruce it up a little with pink ribbons and white feathers!
Edgeworth:
I appreciate the offer, but... let's keep it like this for now. (Kay's memories would only become even more confused.)
Kay's Memories
Ema:
I wonder why Kay lost her memories? Maybe she saw something really shocking...
Edgeworth:
Indeed... She seems to have gotten herself involved in a murder case, after all.
Ema:
I also went through some pretty scary things in the past, as well... ...but thanks to my sister and everyone else who saved me, I can be who I am today. Mr. Edgeworth! We're definitely going to save Kay, OK!?
Edgeworth:
...Yes, of course.
Stuffed Animal
Edgeworth:
Do you like this sort of thing, Ema?
Ema:
Well... Between the fabric, the texture, and the weight, I find this item quite fascinating! Judging from the damage to the fur, it would appear that this was made quite a long time ago!
Edgeworth:
Umm, didn't you say it was "cute" earlier...?
Ema:
I do think it's cute. But that's a different matter entirely!
Edgeworth:
(I don't understand how that's different at all.)
Anything else
Ema:
Scientifically speaking, I'd have to say that the details are unknown.
Edgeworth:
So, in plain English... You don't know anything about it, right?
Ema:
It's not that I don't know. It's just that the details! Are unknown!
Desk on the left
Edgeworth:
Th-These are...
Ema:
Wh-What is it?
Edgeworth:
The items displayed on this shelf here, if I recall correctly... ...they're all evidence from past cases that I was involved with. What are they doing here...?
Ema:
Hmm. I guess that would make this place the P.I.C.'s evidence storeroom, huh?
Edgeworth:
These items should be kept in the care of the police.
Ema:
Don't they keep evidence in the Prosecutor's Office?
Edgeworth:
Only for current trials. However, once a verdict has been reached... ...the evidence is transferred over to the police department, and stored in the evidence room.
Ema:
But it looks like the evidence has been stored here instead...
Edgeworth:
(There's no point in worrying about it. For now, I should try examining everything.) It looks like some of evidence have tags in front of them. And there are numbers written on the tags.
Ema:
Maybe they're the ID numbers of the evidence?
Edgeworth:
No. Based on how large these numbers are and the nature of these items, I'd say... ...these are prices (Prices - Prices are attached to the piece of evidence. They seem rather high.).
Ema:
P-Prices! If that's the case... ...Wow! These are ridiculously expensive!
Edgeworth:
(She seems more concerned with the high prices than the legality of this whole affair...)
Before examining stuffed animal and deducing
Edgeworth:
(The evidence on display... I should inspect every nook and cranny.)
After examining stuffed animal and deducing
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Star-shaped mark
Ema:
That's strange. Only this one spot is empty. But it still has a price tag, just like all the others...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Furthermore, there is a part of this cloth that is not covered in dust. Perhaps something was placed here not so long ago?
Ema:
I see! It sure seems like it. Hmm, but... ...what could it have been?
Edgeworth:
(This star-shaped mark in the dust. I wonder... Could it be related to a certain piece of evidence?)
Star-shaped mark (after deducing)
Ema:
The murder weapon was placed here, right? This storeroom... sure is a scary place.
Edgeworth:
However, Ema, at the same time... ...it also means this spot is deeply tied to the case.
Ema:
The spirit of inquiry is the cornerstone of science! Let's inspect every nook and cranny. ...Just not the scary places!
Stuffed animal
Ema:
Awww, how cute! This stuffed animal is so fluffy!
Edgeworth:
That's from Gourd Lake. (It should be in the care of the prosecutor assigned to that case right now... Why is it sitting here in a place like this?)
Ema:
Huh? This little guy's missing his left horn!
Edgeworth:
Hmm. His left horn... I'm pretty sure it was already missing when I first saw it.
Ema:
Then, this must be a defective product. I demand a recall!
Edgeworth:
(Now that I think about it... ...giving a broken toy to a country's president does sound strange.)
First time
Stuffed Animal data jotted down in my Organizer.
Ema:
This storeroom contains items to be sold, doesn't it?
Edgeworth:
It's unfortunate, but the possibility seems quite high. I suspect some nefarious individual has been selling evidence here.
Ema:
And people actually pay money for this stuff?
Edgeworth:
...Apparently, some people do. The price tags are proof.
Ema:
Different strokes for different folks, I guess...
Lamp and ink
Edgeworth:
Ink... and a lamp. Both are evidence that I've handled before.
Ema:
Why is all this stuff here linked to you?
Edgeworth:
Many of the items here are objects that I've handled just a short while ago. But it's probably only a coincidence that they're all collected here.
Ema:
A coincidence!? I never thought I'd hear you say that word, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
No matter how improbable, if it fits with the facts, then we must accept it as the truth... Isn't that the same with science?
Ema:
Aha! We should discuss science in detail some day, Mr. Edgeworth!
Iron Infant doll
Ema:
What a cute doll. It kinda looks like the Steel Samurai.
Edgeworth:
(It's the Iron Infant, son of the Steel Samurai and the Pink Princess... He was destined to become a hero of justice from the moment of his birth. So much pressure rests on his tiny baby shoulders. And yet, he carries himself with a grace and dignity that belies a toddler of his age.)
Ema:
...Hello! Mr. Edgeworth! Are you even listening to me?
Edgeworth:
Hm? O-Of course I am!
Small bottle
Edgeworth:
It's a small bottle. I've seen this piece of evidence before in the past.
Ema:
.....Huh? Is that all?
Edgeworth:
Uh. Yes. What more did you want me to say?
Ema:
Umm, I need to make a memo. Note to self... Even the most boring objects sound like works of art when Mr. Edgeworth describes them.
Edgeworth:
(Ngh...! Don't read a memo like that out loud!)
Mannequin
Ema:
This mannequin... I've got it! According to my scientific reasoning... ...this is something you encountered in one of your past cases, right!?
Edgeworth:
...No, it's not. This is the first time I've seen this mannequin. (It seems completely unrelated to the other objects in this room. There's no price tag in front of this mannequin either. So then, why is it here?)
Deduce
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce star-shaped mark and present Candelabra
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"This dust pattern... matches up perfectly with the base of the candelabra!"
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
Ema, please observe the state of this area.
Ema:
Oh! Scientifically speaking, you've found something, right!?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Wouldn't you say this spot is connected to the evidence?
Ema:
Hmm... I would say no, wouldn't you?
Edgeworth:
Argh! (So it's not connected...)
Ema:
Let's have another good look at this area! Surely, there must be something that sticks out to you?
Edgeworth:
(Something that sticks out... Perhaps if I compare it to the evidence I hold.)
Edgeworth:
This dust pattern... matches up perfectly with the base of the candelabra! It's likely that the killer got the candelabra from this very storeroom.
Ema:
Does that mean... the candelabra was also a piece of evidence?
Edgeworth:
It's quite possible. However, that is not the issue here. The murder weapon originally came from this storeroom. We must keep that in mind.
Masks
Ema:
Don't you think it's kinda creepy how all these masks are lined up in such a dark place?
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Ema, are you not good with horror movies?
Ema:
N-N-N-N-No way! Horror movies are so unscientific.
Edgeworth:
(...So she's scared of them.)
Before deducing
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After deducing
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Orange mask
Ema:
Th-This mask is...! ...the Mysterious Global Hero... Onyankopon!
Edgeworth:
Why are you so surprised?
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth, don't you know? Everything about this show is shrouded in mystery! From he production company to the broadcast times... Even the merchandise is hard to find!
Edgeworth:
(Wouldn't that mean... the company simply went bankrupt?)
Flower mask
Ema:
It's Captain Saipan! He's really popular in Europe. All the kids, and even the adults, dress up like him.
Edgeworth:
(...I think the flower on his head would be a little too much.)
Helmet masks
Ema:
What TV show are these masks from?
Edgeworth:
I'm not very familiar with it, but... I believe it's called "The Students of the Starry School." Each member of the class is a hero of justice.
Ema:
So I guess those red and white caps are a part of their school uniforms! And maybe the number of eye slits on the masks corresponds to their class rankings? See, the one on the left is ranked Number 1, and the one on the right is Number 2, and so on.
Edgeworth:
Oh... I see. So that's how it works.
Ema:
If that's the case, the student with the lowest rank would have a mask full of holes...!
Edgeworth:
(...I guess we'll have to watch the show to find out.)
Pink Princess mask
Edgeworth:
When you think of the heroines from the Steel Samurai universe, she's the first to come to mind.
Ema:
That's right! I love the Pink Princess too!
Edgeworth:
...Ema, you watch this kind of show?
Ema:
Yeah, of course! You like it too, don't you, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
! No, I... wouldn't go that far.
Ema:
Really? Since you had a Steel Samurai figure in your office, I thought for sure...
Edgeworth:
(Ngh... So even Ema has noticed it...!)
Empty hook
Edgeworth:
Various masks are placed here... There's even one of the Steel Samurai. (Indeed, these are... fairly high-quality replicas.)
Ema:
Scientifically speaking... it's just a bunch of random masks!
Edgeworth:
It certainly does look like a hodgepodge collection of masks. Hmm, this hook is...
Ema:
It looks like a hook to hang a mask from.
Edgeworth:
(I wonder what mask used to be here?)
Steel Samurai masks
Edgeworth:
The Steel Samurai, Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo, and the Nickel Samurai...
Ema:
The Nickel Samurai always seemed kinda smug by comparison. And his slender build doesn't look cool at all! I definitely prefer the Steel Samurai.
Edgeworth:
(...Hm. It seems she has good taste.)
Files
Edgeworth:
These are...! Murder case files!
Ema:
Ehhh!? Wh-What are those doing here?
Edgeworth:
By all rights, they should be kept at the Prosecutor's Building or the courthouse, but... ...it would seem that someone has removed them. (Something is afoot, and we are none the wiser...!)
Deduce
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce empty hook and present Jammin' Ninja Mask
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"The Jammin' Ninja mask that Kay had with her..."
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
Ema, what do you think about this piece of evidence, and this area?
Ema:
Hmm... Scientifically speaking, I'd say they're not connected at all!
Edgeworth:
Nwargh! (That was fast.)
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please look over this area again. Doesn't it feel like something is missing?
Edgeworth:
(Something is missing...? Do I have any idea as to what this missing item could be?)
Edgeworth:
The Jammin' Ninja mask that Kay had with her... Perhaps it was originally attached to this hook!
Ema:
That sounds plausible. Scientifically speaking. In other words... Kay came here?
Edgeworth:
It's quite likely. But... for what purpose?
Ema:
Maybe she was going to steal something from this place.
Edgeworth:
(A Great Thief who steals the truth, huh...) No, I don't think we can answer that question at this time.
Wooden trunk
Ema:
Scientifically speaking, this must be a wooden ice box. This chain is tied around it to keep the cold from escaping. Probably.
Edgeworth:
No, Ema... Wouldn't this be a costume trunk? It's made from wood that repels bugs in order to protect the clothes inside.
Ema:
Ah, I see. Of course! That's another possible theory. If your clothes are stored in a cold place, it would be nice and cool to wear in the summer.
Edgeworth:
(...I guess she's sticking to her ice box theory.)
Trophies
Ema:
There's a transceiver sitting next to all these trophies.
Edgeworth:
(It seems like they were lined up together on purpose...)
Ema:
Looks like it's still got batteries in it. Might come in handy later, so I'll pick them up for now... I'll be sure to put it to good use before I turn it in to the police.
Edgeworth:
(That sounds just like what a certain Great Thief would say...)
Statue
Leads to:
"This statue...!"
Yellow desk
Ema:
Wow... Talk about bad taste! I've never seen such a gaudy desk before! Just what kind of person would use something like this?
Edgeworth:
(The table top is being supported by four naked men. The design is quite painful to look at. It certainly is in poor taste.)
Ema:
Maybe this is also related to one of your past cases?
Edgeworth:
No. None of the cases I handled involved a person with such bad taste. (...Or at least I hope not.)
Kay Faraday
Kay:
Yes? Can I help with something?
Present
Stuffed Animal
Kay:
That's a cute stuffed animal. ...Is it a bull?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It appears so. I found this at a crime scene with you just the other day...
Kay:
One of its horns is broken... So I guess even a stuffed animal can get injured... Ah...! My head, it hurts...!
Edgeworth:
! What's wrong?
Kay:
For some reason, looking at that stuffed animal makes my head...!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... I'd better put this away for now.)
Lift
Ema:
Look, look. Check it out. This lift has a sturdy platform and solid steel supports! According to my calculations, it should be able to support the weight of 50 Mr. Edgeworths.
Edgeworth:
I doubt there is enough space for that many people. It seems to be used for moving goods.
Ema:
I wonder about that. If you pack them in real tight, they just might fit. All 50 of them.
Edgeworth:
Impossible. That aside, there are still some more places in this storeroom we need to examine. We'll examine the lift after we finish our investigation here.
Ema:
Impossible, huh... Then how about 45! No, we might even be able to fit 48 people...
Raymond Shields
Ray:
Oh man. Uncle Ray's heart is pounding up a storm! Surrounded by so many cutie-pies in such a small, cramped room!
Edgeworth:
...Mr. Shields. Please try to be more serious.
Ray:
Heh heh heh. It was just a joke. Uncle Ray's keeping a close watch over little Kay. So you can continue your investigation without worry.
Edgeworth:
(You watching over Kay is exactly what I'm worried about...)
Money
Edgeworth:
There's a huge stack of money piled up here. ...How unrefined.
Ema:
They're all 100 dollar bills! Talk about big bucks (Big bucks - Stacks of cash found in storeroom. A big deal went down here.)! So, how many times your yearly salary do you think this is worth?
Edgeworth:
Leave my salary out of this!
Giant head
Ema:
What's this? It looks like... a giant head!
Edgeworth:
If I recall, this is the head of "Mrs. Monkey." (I believe it was from a case I was involved with in the past. It's impressive how they were able to get such a large object into this room.)
Ema:
Hrmm. "Mrs. Monkey", huh? That doesn't really have a nice ring to it. Maybe you remembered the name wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Ngh... I-Impossible. (That can't be true!)
Edgeworth:
This statue...!
Ema:
Yes, is it some sort of new fact?
Edgeworth:
No... this is evidence from a case that I was previously involved in. (I believe it was called the "Alice Red" statue. There were supposed to be two of them, one real and one fake, but... ...no matter which one this is, it's unnatural for it to turn up in a place like this.)
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth, you've really seen a lot of cases..... huh?
???:
Gotchaaaaaa! Yippee-ki-yay! I got me a scoooooop!
Ema:
Eeeeek!
Edgeworth:
Gah... my eyes...! Stop it!
Lotta:
Ya ain't gettin' away from the Great Lotta's camera that easily! I reckon y'all must be criminals! I'ma snap 16 shots before y'all can even say "Cheese!"
Ema:
We're not criminals!
Lotta:
...Really? Ya ain't foolin' my camera of justice with those words!
Edgeworth:
Hm, you are...
Lotta:
Huuh? Yer... Ain't ya that heinous prosecutor from back then!?
Edgeworth:
Who are you calling heinous!? (This is Lotta Hart... She's a photographer I've dealt with during my past cases. I see her distinctive accent and her chatterbox mouth haven't changed a bit.)
Lotta:
Just look at that face! Yer obviously up to no good!
Edgeworth:
(It seems she has a bad impression of us.)
Lotta:
Now it's time to pay yer dues! Stand still while I photograph y'all!
Ema:
We only came here to investigate...
Lotta:
Lies! Ya think ya can fool me like that?
Ema:
...Mr. Edgeworth. She's not listening at all.
Edgeworth:
...She seems harmless. Let's just leave her be, for now.
Partner
Ema:
Ask me anything you want!
Lotta Hart
Ema:
Somehow, I get the feeling she doesn't like you very much, Mr. Edgeworth. She's even calling you absurd things like a heinous prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
She's been involved with a few of my previous cases. Her turning up here was a bit unexpected, but let us continue with our own investigation. If we gather clues, and connect them with "Logic"... ...then the truth will come to me. That is my way of doing things. I won't let a "heinous journalist" get in my way!
Ema:
.....Umm, Mr. Edgeworth? Are you bothered by being called a heinous prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
Ngh... M-Most definitely not!
The Information (after connecting money logic, before speaking to Lotta Hart again)
Ema:
I wonder what Ms. Hart came here to do? Armed with such a nice camera, it looks like she was after something.
Edgeworth:
We know that the trading of evidence had taken place here. There is a chance that what she was after may be related to that.
Ema:
I really don't want to, but let's  hear what she has to say!
Edgeworth:
Verily. I agree. (Especially about the "not wanting to" part...)
Lotta Hart
Lotta:
So... what're all y'all folks doin' in a suspicious place like this?
Edgeworth:
I-I was about to ask you the very same question. Why are you here?
Lotta:
For the people of the world, and for myself! I'm a social justice photographer after all! So I gotta take photo after photo after photo for my big scooop!
Edgeworth:
(It seems I won't be able to talk to her normally when she's like this...)
Lotta Hart (after connecting money logic)
First time
Edgeworth:
So, why did you come here?
Lotta:
For the people of the world, and for myself! I'm a social justice photographer after all!
Ema:
S-Social Justice...
Edgeworth:
Then allow me to guess the reason why you came here. Was it perhaps to expose the illegal trafficking?
Ema:
Oh, I get it. You were trying to get a scoop on the secret dealings!
Lotta:
...H-Huh. Y'all know that much already? Well, I reckon there ain't no reason to hide it anymore... My sources tell me there's some kind of black market auction bein' held round these parts.
Edgeworth:
What did you say!? So then, all this evidence here is...
Lotta:
Yup, they're the goods for the auction. There's a lotta dirty money flyin' round here. I wanted to try and catch it with my own two eyes. My source gave me a whole buncha info, but... ...I figured just hearing about it ain't enough. Seein' is believein', after all. So I've been stakin' out the place from behind this here statue since yesterday. The auction took place late last night, and went on 'til the early mornin'.
Edgeworth:
(A murder on the night of the black market auction. Could the two events be related...?)
Lotta Hart (after connecting money logic)
Lotta:
Y'all got somethin' to say?
The auction
Lotta:
Black market dealings in the Grand Tower!! Guess I really hit the mother lode this time!
Edgeworth:
Were all the items in the auction pieces of evidence?
Lotta:
There was some normal stuff too, like stolen art and the like.
Edgeworth:
(I wouldn't consider stolen art to be normal.)
Lotta:
But, I reckon the evidence was the star of the show here! These folks are law fanatics, tryin' to get their hands on the latest goods from the police.
Ema:
So that's what you wanted to get pictures of, Ms. Hart? Pretty much! They were meetin' right under this very storeroom. So I watched 'em from up here.
Edgeworth:
You said you were here since yesterday. Did you witness the entire event?
Lotta:
It was a black market auction, after all. They followed a fairly detailed procedure. First, the participants entered the storeroom from the viewin' platform one at a time. When they got in, they each took one of those masks on the wall over there... Funny thing 'bout those masks... They're all equipped with voice changers. Itty bitty ones. That way they wouldn't be recognized. They wanted to protect their... "an anemone"?
Ema:
You mean... their "anonymity"?
Lotta:
Yeah, that's it! Their "anomnintany"!
Edgeworth:
(Why not just say "identity" and make things easier for all of us...?)
Lotta:
After puttin' on the mask, they'd go down the lift, and the next feller would come right in. On the way back, it was the exact same thing, but in reverse. They'd come up one by one, return the mask, and head up outta the storeroom.
Ema:
Wow, that's pretty thorough.
Masks data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Hmm. How many participants were there?
Lotta:
11 people altogether. I counted each of 'em as they made their way down (Auction participants - Entered the storeroom from roof one at a time. Exited the same way.).
What happened? (appears after The auction)
Lotta:
I'll have you know, I wasn't just laid up behind this statue the entire time.
Edgeworth:
Then, where were you in the beginning?
Lotta:
The beginnin'...? Well, don't you worry yerself about that, ya hear?
Edgeworth:
(So she was hiding behind the statue the entire time.)
Lotta:
I watched the folks comin' in while lurkin' in the shadows... All secret agent-like...
Ema:
Note to self: secret agents like to lurk in the shadows.
Lotta:
And then, they used that lift over there to get down to the auction site. After they all went down, I watched the whole thing from the lift.
Edgeworth:
Did that lift stay down the entire time?
Lotta:
Naw, it came back up. But there's a tiny gap in the floor there. There's a bit of space between the floor and the lift platform, ya see. So I could see just about everything that was goin' on down there.
Edgeworth:
Then, did you see the person who was conducting the auction!?
Lotta:
Eh!? W-Well... yeah! You betcha, I did! What kinda story would this be if I didn't know who the "Conductor" was?
Edgeworth:
(The Conductor, huh? It seems I'll need to ask her for more details.)
The Conductor (appears after What happened?)
Edgeworth:
Do you have any more information about this so-called Conductor?
Lotta:
........Ya know. I came here to get me a scoop. What makes ya think I'll give up my info to you all willy nilly!?
Edgeworth:
Basically... what you're saying is, you don't know.
Ema:
Ah, I see. So that's why she won't answer!
Lotta:
.....What can I say? I couldn't even tell how old they were, or if they were a guy or a gal.
Edgeworth:
Can you tell me what the person was wearing at the time?
Lotta:
They had on a white jacket with a purple flower, and they were wearin' white gloves. But ya know, that don't mean much when I have no earthly clue who they really are.
Ema:
So the Conductor's identity was hidden, just like the participants?
Lotta:
That's right! They had on a mask and voice changer, just like everyone else!
Edgeworth:
What kind of mask... did this person wear?
Lotta:
It was... a "Zurvan" mask, I reckon!
Edgeworth:
Zu... Zurvan...! What in blazes is that supposed to be...?
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth! You don't know about Zurvan? He's the sworn enemy of Global Hero Onyankopon! "Zurvan, the Ruler of Time!" Seriously! Who hasn't heard of him!?
Edgeworth:
(Most people, I'd imagine...) Since the Conductor wore a mask, I assume you were not able to see their face...?
Lotta:
Not even a teeny weeny bit! And after I came all this way for my big scoop... *sniff*... This whole story's turnin' out to be nuthin' but fool's gold.
Conductor's Clothes jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
(That set of clothes seems familiar. Perhaps I should show her that piece of evidence.)
Present
Yatagarasu's Badge
Lotta:
Th-That badge is...!
Edgeworth:
It's the genunine badge of the Yatagarasu. Perhaps we could trade some information...
Lotta:
Not a chance. The Yatagarasu ain't nothing but yesterday's biscuits. I need somethin' with more impact! That there badge won't stir up nothin' interestin'.
Edgeworth:
Stir things up...? Don't tell me you intend to spread false information?
Lotta:
Don't be draggin' my name through the mud. I just wanna spice things up a bit. ...Maybe dress it up a little and add some juicy bits here and there.
Edgeworth:
You shouldn't compromise your stories with fabrications, Ms. Hart!
Autopsy Report
Leads to:
"You said the Conductor wore a white jacket with a purple flower, and white gloves?"
Masks or Conductor's Clothes
Lotta:
Hmm. If I'm gonna make the news, I'll need to find out the Conductor's true identity.
Edgeworth:
That person wore a mask and a voice changer, right?
Lotta:
Along with a white suit and a purple flower. Aww, shucks! Was all this a waste of time?
Edgeworth:
I wouldn't say you wasted your time, Ms. Hart.
Lotta:
Collectin' info ain't easy! You gotta pay for film, and travel expenses... And after stakin' out the place for a whole day, I'm starvin'!
Edgeworth:
If you are truly after a scoop, you should be willing to endure that much!
Anything else
Lotta:
Lemme just say, if yer tryin' to grab my interest... ...ya gotta bring me something that actually smells like a scoop!
Edgeworth:
(...I guess this didn't catch her interest.)
Statue
Ema:
Earlier, you said that this was evidence from a case that you were involved with. At any rate, you've gotta admit that this is a very strange statue.
Edgeworth:
It's the Alice Red statue.
Ema:
.....Huh?
Edgeworth:
This is the Alice Red statue.
Ema:
But it doesn't look all red to me... Wait, the name is written here: "Alif Red" statue. Alif Red... All is Red. All is Red... Alif Red.
Edgeworth:
Hm? What are you mumbling to yourself about over there?
Ema:
N-No! It's nothing. Come on, let's examine some other places!
Edgeworth:
(.....?)
Edgeworth:
You said the Conductor wore a white jacket with a purple flower, and white gloves?
Lotta:
That's right. They sure looked spiffy for a criminal mastermind.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Hart, did they look anything like this?
Lotta:
Heeeey! That's it! That's the Conductor! ...H-H-Hold yer horses! Are ya tellin' me the Conductor is dead!?
Edgeworth:
She is the victim of a case we are investigating.
Ema:
Her name is Jill Crane. Have you heard of her?
Lotta:
Can't say I have... So, she was a lady, huh. What kinda gal dresses like that? She get her kicks by foolin' me into thinkin' she's a guy!?
Edgeworth:
(I doubt that her intention was to deceive you... Setting that aside... We have established something of major importance. The victim was the Conductor of the black market auction.)
Lotta:
I see... so the Conductor was killed. Then that might explain...
Edgeworth:
Explain what, Ms. Hart?
Lotta:
Ah! N-No, no, no! It's nothin', honest!
Ema:
Ms. Hart... You clearly sounded suspicious just now.
Lotta:
And I'm tellin' ya, I ain't! Hmm, can't be...
Edgeworth:
...Sorry, were you trying to say something?
Lotta:
No, I ain't! I ain't said nothin'!
Ema:
Please don't be like that. Just tell us.
Lotta:
How many times do I gotta tell y'all? I'm a journalist! Information is what pays the bills. I can't just go around spoutin' everything I know! I've already said too much! I got nothin' left to say to y'all!
Ema:
Th-Then! What if I found some fingerprints for you?
Lotta:
Wh-What good would that do me!? I don't want none of yer dusty old prints! Why don't you two follow my example, and do some investigatin' on yer own!
Ema:
Ooh... I guess she won't tell us anything.
Edgeworth:
Not to worry, Ema. Just leave it to me. I have a certain method of drawing out information from those who wish to hide it. If my opponent's lips are sealed, I will be the one to unseal them. Let us begin.
Edgeworth:
First, let's analyze my opponent's demeanor...
3 CHESS PIECES
Lotta:
I ain't tellin' you nothin'! So quit wastin' my time.
Edgeworth:
(She seems rather impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation.) I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses. I'm almost certain... that she's hiding something from me. That's where I'll begin my attack. Now, time for the first move!

Edgeworth:
The information she is hiding could be vital to the investigation. I need to make her talk. Next, I will press her on the contents of her scoop. She may be quick to lose her temper, but she's even quicker to loosen her tongue. She is not a different opponent. Now, to extract the information I need.

Uugh... A little while after the auction started... ...someone won a bid, and the Conductor banged the gavel. Someone hollered, "We'll finish the deal upstairs", or somethin' like that. "That ain't good!" I thought to myself, as I hurried back to hide behind the statue.
Edgeworth:
Did you see whoever came up?
Lotta:
Not quite, but I reckon the feller that came up was the winner of the bid. I could smell the buttery aroma of big, fat wads of cash.
Edgeworth:

Lotta:
I reckon this room is where the bidders ponied up the dough for their purchases. The two of 'em talked for a while...

Yeah. I thought it was strange too. I coulda sworn there were two of 'em, but... ...when I looked, there was only the one. But, that's gotta be the killer, don't ya reckon?
Edgeworth:
(So, she's saying the victim disappeared (Victim disappeared - The murder may have occurred in the storeroom during the auction.)...?) You were able to tell this person was the culprit just by looking?
Lotta:
Their hand was stained bright red, so I figured it was them.

What happened to the auction after the murder?

Lotta's Photo
Kay:
The person who pushed me! I'm sure it was this person!
Edgeworth:
Yet you don't remember their face.
Kay:
But... that red raincoat... Umm, I'm sure of it, I think... ........Probably.
Edgeworth:
Please be more clear! I'd like a straight answer.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... When you look at me like that, I begin to lose my confidence...
Edgeworth:
My expression is not relevant. Was it this person, or not?
Kay:
That red raincoat... It has to be the one.
Edgeworth:
(If that is true, it would be impossible for Kay to be the culprit. I'll need to gather more evidence.)
Edgeworth:
If we assume that the murder took place in this storeroom... ...then we must conclude that the body was here as well.
Ema:
Huh? Isn't that... pretty obvious?
Edgeworth:
Do you remember how the participants left the auction?
Ema:
Of course. They'd pass through this storeroom on the way back from the auction... Ah!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. The culprit had to hide the body, so that the participants wouldn't discover it. (The real question is... where was the body hidden? (Where was the body hidden? - Culprit hid the body so it would not be seen by the auction participants.)) Ema, would you mind lending me a hand?
Ema:
Leave it to me! What do you want me to do?
Edgeworth:
Let's see... Use your luminol reagent to test for a blood reaction... If you would, please?
Ema:
OK! Let me show you the power of science!
Edgeworth:
(The glint in her eyes is getting brighter by the second...)
Ema:
Let's start by examining that ladder over there! Based on Ms. Hart's picture... ...the person in the red raincoat headed towards that ladder. Chances are, something will turn up if we check there! Just touch anything you want to examine! If you do that, you'll be able to spray the luminol reagent at it! If there's a bloodstain on the spot where you sprayed, you'll get a reaction like this. Even so... Ugh. No matter how many times I see bloodstains, they're always so gruesome... There's a blood reaction here, but it's kind of faint. Let's spray it with luminol two or three more times, so it'll be nice and clear! You can see it clearly now. Ugh... It looks even more gruesome than before. Do you understand how to look for bloodstains now? There are probably a few more bloodstains here, so why don't you give it a try, Mr. Edgeworth?
Spray luminol on top of ladder
Leads to:
"Let's search the rest of the storeroom for bloodstains just like that!"
Ema:
Let's search the rest of the storeroom for bloodstains just like that! First, let's look for a place to spray the luminol reagent.
Luminol
Ema:
Please examine the places you want to spray luminol on!
Ladder
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth! You already examined that bloodstain some time ago. Come on! Let's go look for new bloodstains!
Edgeworth:
(Why is she so enthusiastic about this?)
Wooden trunk
Ema:
You want to examine this spot? Let's spray luminol on every suspicious-looking nook and cranny!
Spray luminol on the inside of trunk
Leads to:
"Mr. Edgeworth! There's a bloodstain here too...!"
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth! There's a bloodstain here too...!
Edgeworth:
However... Why is there a bloodstain in a place like this?
Ema:
Maybe something that had blood on it was stored inside? (Bloodstain in costume trunk - A bloodstain was found inside the costume trunk at the storeroom.)
Before spraying luminol on lift
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth, there are places we still haven't checked yet! So, let's continue our investigation!
Wooden trunk (subsequent times)
Ema:
Do you understand? Criminals always leave behind bloodstains in unexpected places. There could be blood on the windows of your apartment. Or bloodstains on the carpet.
Edgeworth:
(That sounds like a smooth criminal...)
Lotta, Raymond or Kay
Ema:
Hey! You can't spray luminol on people!
Edgeworth:
Yes... Of course. I knew that.
Lift
Ema:
You want to examine this spot? Let's spray luminol on every suspicious-looking nook and cranny!
Spray luminol on lower left of lift
Leads to:
"Mr. Edgeworth! There's a reaction! It's a bloodstain!"
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth! There's a reaction! It's a bloodstain! But... Why in a place like this...?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps this was where the murder took place...
Ema:
Ah! It looks like some of the blood dripped down to the floor below.

Mr. Edgeworth, there are places we still haven't checked yet! So, let's continue our investigation!
Lift (subsequent times)
Ema:
Is this... the victim's blood?
Anywhere else
Ema:
You want to examine this spot?
Ema:
Unfortunately, there were no reactions here...
(Spraying luminol on wooden trunk and lift leads to:)
Ema:
Looks like we've found all the bloodstains in this storeroom!
Edgeworth:
It seems we have investigated the storeroom sufficiently.
Logic
"Where was the body hidden?" and "Bloodstain in costume trunk"
Edgeworth:
The reason why we found a bloodstain in the costume trunk... ...is because the murderer hid the body in that box!
Ema:
I wonder who won the bid for it. The trunk, I mean.
Edgeworth:
That, I don't know... (In a certain way, everything worked out exactly as someone wanted.)
Lotta:
Hold it! Hold it! It couldn't have been in that dressin' box!
Edgeworth:
...What do you mean?
Lotta:
When I first came down here, that box caught my eye too. It was just the right side and woulda made the perfect hidin' place! That's what I thought, anyway... But I couldn't get the dang thing to open. It'd been wrapped up real tight with a locked chain. The murder happened after that, so hidin' a body in there woulda been impossible, ya know?
Edgeworth:
A chain wrapped around it? That's a bit strange... Right now, it doesn't seem to be locked up at all...
Lotta:
...Huh? That's weird. Maybe my eyes were playin' tricks on me or somethin'.

I don't think there is anything splendid about bloodstains.
Ema:
Of course there is! You see, even bloodstains have various...
Edgeworth:

Ema:
...Scientifically speaking! Wait, are you even listening, Mr. Edgeworth!? In fact, it may be called a luminol test, but...
Edgeworth:
By the way, Ema, I would like to return to the investigation soon.
Ema:
Whaaaat!? But I'm not even halfway through my explanation yet!

Present
Blood on Hidden Lift
Edgeworth:
Did you not notice this bloodstain?
Lotta:
Oh, did ya find that with the lumina-whatsit?
Edgeworth:
Yes. ...It's likely that the culprit tried to cover up the crime scene.
Lotta:
I ain't even noticed that at all. Did that happen when I wasn't lookin'? Because, ya know, I didn't actually see the moment of the murder myself.
Edgeworth:
Indeed... You were cowering in fear at the time, were you not?
Lotta:
I'm a journalist, ya hear! I was hunkerin' down to protect my scoop! ...I reckon I was snug as a bug behind the Alif Red statue.
Edgeworth:
That is precisely what I mean by "cowering in fear."
(Connecting all possible Logic, examining stuffed animal, and deducing star-shaped mark and empty hook leads to:)
Edgeworth:
And with that, I believe we have examined everything there is to examine here.
Ema:
Well then, let's head on down!
Ray:
Oh, have we decided on our next destination? Heeeey, Kay!
Kay:
Y-Yes, Mr. Shields!
Ray:
We wouldn't want you to get lost, so make sure you stay real close to Uncle Ray, kay?
Kay:
Right! I'll follow you closely, Mr. Shields.

Investigation Complete
April 5, 7:43 PMGrand TowerP.I.C. Meeting Room
Debeste:
Wha-wha-wha-wha...
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
This place is...
Ema:
Is this the auction hall?
Kay:
No, it's... the meeting room from before!
Debeste:
Ha... Ha ha ha... Wah hah hah hah hah! How nice of you to drop in, Kay Faraday!
Kay:
...!
Debeste:
You've got some guts! Hey, you guys, arrest her! Arrest her!
Edgeworth:
Wait, Kay is...
Debeste:
As for the rest of the riff-raff, just show them out the door!
Ema:
This is tyranny!
Gumshoe:
Yeah! It's tyranny, pal!
Ray:
Miiiles. This is kinda bad.
Debeste:
The light of justice shines above me! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hayaaaaargh! YEEEEEEOOWCH!
Gumshoe:
Wh-Why... me too...?
Franziska:
Oh, that's strange. I was aiming for that weak ex-prosecutor.
Debeste:
You were clearly aiming at me!
Franziska:
Maybe something got in my way. Particularly...
Debeste:
HNGYEEEAARGH!
Franziska:
...right around here.
Edgeworth:
Franziska...
Franziska:
Just what do you think you're doing here, Ex-prosecutor Miles Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
...I do not believe that Kay is the culprit behind this incident.
Franziska:
You're just an ordinary man without investigation rights. What you say does not matter... I am Franziska von Karma. I will never stop moving forward. However, you chose to quit. The outcome of our battle has already been decided.
Edgeworth:
I cast away my badge... because it became a millstone around my neck. I shall continue moving forward, even without it. The path I walk will surely lead to the truth... My actions are driven by that belief. And that is something which will never change.
Franziska:
So, you're saying that you've found a path to the truth? Then show it to me! But if that path... proves to be a foolish one, it will not survive my whip!
-- Franziska's Logic --
Franziska:
The victim used her keycard and entered this room with the culprit.
Then, the culprit stabbed the victim in the chest with the candelabra, killing her.
Shouldn't the letter make it obvious who the culprit is?
Of course, the crime scene was right here in this room: the P.I.C. meeting room.
The proof is the bloodstain we found here in the meeting room! That settles it, Miles Edgeworth.
Ema:
Ms. von Karma seems really confident, doesn't she?
Ray:
Ah, I see! She's a fiery one, isn't she? I don't mind a feisty cutie. So how about an introductory hu-UUUUUG!
Franziska:
...How repulsive. Well, Miles Edgeworth. Can you break my logic? If you truly have no intention of stopping here, prove it to me with evidence!
Edgeworth:
...Very well. I'll show you, Franziska. The evidence that paves my path!
Rebuttal
-- Franziska's Logic --
Franziska:
The victim used her keycard and entered this room with the culprit.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Was there nothing suspicious about the security system?
Franziska:
The meeting room's security is perfect, much like my logic. ...There is no room for doubt.
Edgeworth:
(Your logic isn't as perfect as you think...) ...In any case, your opinion has not changed?
Franziska:
Yes. The victim and the culprit entered the room together.
Franziska:
Then, the culprit stabbed the victim in the chest with the candelabra, killing her.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Did the victim's wounds match up with the candelabra?
Franziska:
The victim's chest was pierced in three places simultaneously by a sharp metal object. Is there anything else that could have done such a thing? That should all be written in Dr. Young's autopsy report.
Edgeworth:
...So you're sure that the murder weapon was the candelabra?
Franziska:
Exactly. As for who the culprit is...
Franziska:
Shouldn't the letter make it obvious who the culprit is?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Do you have anything to confirm that the letter was actually sent by Kay?
Franziska:
Are you proposing that it was forged by the real criminal? That possibility was dismissed some time ago. There were no traces of forgery on the letter. Of course, there were no other traces besides Kay Faraday and the victim found on the letter.
Edgeworth:
...Are you saying you found Kay's fingerprints on the letter?
Franziska:
The only fingerprints we found belonged to the victim.
Ray:
In other words... you can't really say that Kay is the culprit.
Franziska:
Didn't I just say that the possibility of a forgery has been dismissed? That letter was originally sent by Kay Faraday. Therefore, it is only natural to assume that she is the culprit.
Franziska:
Of course, the crime scene was right here in this room: the P.I.C. meeting room.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Do you have any proof that the crime took place in this room?
Franziska:
"A Von Karma is perfect in every way." Perhaps you forgot that when you gave up your badge?
Franziska:
The proof is the bloodstain we found here in the meeting room! That settles it, Miles Edgeworth.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Have we determined who the blood actually belongs to?
Franziska:
The blood analysis confirmed that it belonged to the victim.
Edgeworth:
Just because the bloodstain was found here, doesn't mean that this was the scene of the crime.
Franziska:
You forget, Miles Edgeworth, that in court, evidence is everything. If you believe this room is not the crime scene, show me the evidence that proves it!
Edgeworth:
(Evidence that shows where the crime took place? We may not be in court, but... I'll show her the truth!)
Present Blood on Hidden Lift
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"If memory serves me correctly..."
Ema:
Ms. von Karma isn't showing any openings!
Edgeworth:
However, there is one fact we know that she does not.
Ema:
They're not the only ones who can perform scientific investigations!
Edgeworth:
(And therein lies the proof... the path to the truth I've found!)
Edgeworth:
If memory serves me correctly... ...the blood in the meeting room was found in front of the statue of Lady Justice, was it not?
Franziska:
To murder someone before Lady Justice... This culprit knows no fear.
Edgeworth:
I wonder about that. Have a look at this piece of evidence. Blood was found in the storeroom right above the meeting room. As you can see, there are signs that it has dripped down onto the floor below. And right under the hidden lift is...
Franziska:
The statue of Lady Justice...!
Edgeworth:
Then you understand. The murder did not take place here. The killer murdered the victim in the storeroom, and then moved the body to this room. What Lady Justice witnessed was a coward trying to conceal their crime! And not the moment of the murder!
Franziska:
.........
Edgeworth:
(...She's smiling?)
Franziska:
...Pardon me. I just remembered a conversation quite similar to this one. As I expected, Miles Edgeworth. ...Such naïveté couldn't possibly be an act.
Gumshoe:
Just how is Mr. Edgeworth naïve!? YEOOOOOOWCH!
Franziska:
Have you forgotten? Or are you just playing the foolish fool? The amount of blood in the meeting room is clearly greater than in the storeroom.
Gumshoe:
Uugh... Please don't just hit me and then ignore me... YEAAAARGH!
Franziska:
Such a large amount of blood couldn't have simply dripped from the floor above. And even if it had, there should have been much more blood left behind in the storeroom! The murder could not have occurred anywhere other than this meeting room!
Edgeworth:
...Hmph. You're as predictable as always, Franziska.
Franziska:
Wh-What...!
Edgeworth:
The difference in the amount of blood is just as you say. The question is, why does such a difference exist?
Franziska:
That issue is trivial. I've already explained it with my perfect logic.
Edgeworth:
In that case, how do you explain the blood that was found in the storeroom? I don't suppose you're going to tell me that it somehow sprayed all the way up there?
Debeste:
Like a water fountain? No waaay!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. It's impossible. In other words... ...the reason for the difference in the amount of blood is... (The amount of blood in the meeting room and the storeroom are different because...)
The weapon was pulled out here
Leads to:
"The victim died of a stab wound. Naturally, there would be a significant amount of blood loss."
She was stabbed here
Edgeworth:
The victim was stabbed with the murder weapon in the meeting room!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth, who was it that said the storeroom was the scene of the crime? Take responsibility for your own claims!
Edgeworth:
Gwaaah! (It seems I was mistaken! The blood in the storeroom must have been left when the victim was stabbed. There must have been another moment when the victim was bleeding more heavily. That would explain why such a large amount of blood was left in the meeting room!)
Franziska:
It seems you can't explain the difference in the amount of blood that was left behind.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Do not take me lightly. I already know the answer to that.
Leads back to:
"(The amount of blood in the meeting room and the storeroom are different because...)"
She was stabbed in the storeroom
Edgeworth:
The victim was stabbed in the storeroom with the murder weapon!
Franziska:
Being stabbed in the storeroom doesn't explain the difference in the amount of blood... That explanation is unacceptable!
Edgeworth:
Mmmph! (So it wasn't that! The blood in the storeroom must have been left when the victim was stabbed. There must have been another moment when the victim was bleeding more heavily. That would explain why such a large amount of blood was left in the meeting room!)
Franziska:
It seems you can't explain the difference in the amount of blood that was left behind.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Do not take me lightly. I already know the answer to that.
Leads back to:
"(The amount of blood in the meeting room and the storeroom are different because...)"
Edgeworth:
The victim died of a stab wound. Naturally, there would be a significant amount of blood loss.
Franziska:
...That's obvious just from looking at the bloodstain.
Debeste:
But that's so weird! She was attacked in the storeroom, but there was less blood found there than... GYAAAUUGH!
Franziska:
Silence! You third-rate prosecutor!
Debeste:
But I'm the Best... GYAAAUUGH!
Edgeworth:
Do you know when you lose the most blood after getting stabbed with a sharp object?
Ema:
Ah! I know! It's when the sharp object is pulled out, right!
Edgeworth:
Precisely. After being stabbed with the candelabra, the body was moved to the meeting room. And then, the murder weapon was pulled out right here in this very room... That would account for the difference in the amount of blood that was left behind!
Ema:
But why would the culprit go through all that trouble?
Edgeworth:
Most likely to give the impression that the murder occurred in the meeting room. It seems Ms. Crane's keycard was used last night... ...but based on the time of use, it must have been a ploy by the culprit to mislead us. In all likelihood, it was the culprit who used the keycard to enter the meeting room.
Franziska:
Why would culprit have needed to do that?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps they feared that the storeroom would be found out during the investigation? If they were involved in the auction, they would not have wanted it to become public.
Meeting Room Blood data jotted down in my Organizer.
Franziska:
The auction... you say?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps you should go upstairs and see for yourself what items are on display. I'm sure that will allow you to understand what occurred here.
Franziska:
........ ...Impressive, Miles Edgeworth. You're willing to go that far to protect her?
Edgeworth:
There's something big lurking behind the scenes of this case. Kay simply got caught up in it.
Franziska:
You're exaggerating.
Edgeworth:
Am I now? More than anyone, I would think you'd understand the significance behind all this. Why would you, a prosecutor working with Interpol, be involved in a domestic case? Wasn't your objective to crush a certain international smuggling ring? If your search for smuggled goods has led you here... ...then, isn't this feeling I have related to the case?
Franziska:
...I'm relieved. You haven't lost your touch, even though you've turned in your badge. I've heard about your situation... from Scruffy over there.
Gumshoe:
Ah, umm... sorry, sir. I just wanted to help out somehow...
Edgeworth:
A wise decision, Detective.
Gumshoe:
...!
Edgeworth:
Franziska, are you the one in charge of this case? Isn't Interpol pursing the black market auction?
Franziska:
And what if I am? That's not something you need to know.
Edgeworth:
So, you knew about all this from the very beginning? You knew the black market auction was being held... right here.
Hold it!
Lotta:
Hey, hey, mind if I butt in? About that gal who turned up dead...
Hold it!
Franziska:
You!
Lotta:
Hey! I ain't done talkin' yet! AIIIEEEE! Ya ain't changed a lick!
Franziska:
This case doesn't need even a fragment of your faulty testimony!
Lotta:
What're ya sayin'!? I'm a bona fide journa-OWWW!
Franziska:
Back then...! You gave false testimony...!
Ema:
...Ms. von Karma seems to really dislike Lotta.
Edgeworth:
...I can't say she's fond of her.
Lotta:
Ain't that Crane gal one of them P.I.C. members? She's the spittin' image of the Conductor! I reckon she's... YEEOOOWCH! She hit me! She hit me again!
Franziska:
What is the meaning of this!? Answer me, Miles Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
From Ms. Hart's testimony, we obtained a description of what the Conductor was wearing. And it matches what the victim, Jill Crane, was wearing.
Franziska:
You mean to say... the one who was murdered was the Conductor! ........!
Gumshoe:
M-Ms. von Karma, maybe you should calm... AIIEEEEE!
Franziska:
It would seem that a new fact has just been brought to light. ...Indeed, I came here in pursuit of the black market auction. In order to arrest the organizer of the event... in other words, the Conductor!
Edgeworth:
If we believe Ms. Hart's testimony, then the Conductor is already dead. Wouldn't this mean that your investigation has ended in vain?
Franziska:
That's right. However... ...I swear on my name that I will not return empty-handed! I challenge you, Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(A challenge is fine, but... ...why is she readying her whip like she's out for a victim of her own?)
-- Franziska's Logic, Pt. 2 --
Franziska:
I will concede your argument. The murder occurred in the storeroom, correct?
That would mean the culprit is someone who participated in the auction.
If that photographer is correct, the victim was the Conductor, and the culprit was a customer.
The culprit waited for the victim in the storeroom, where the goods were delivered.
Then, they stabbed the victim in the chest with the candelabra in the storeroom.
Franziska:
...That is all. I trust you have no objections.
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, that is not the case, because there is a hole in your testimony.
Ema:
As expected of Mr. Edgeworth! I didn't noticed anything at all! Well then, please settle this with one blow!
Edgeworth:
Yes, of course. Watch as I crush her logic!

Franziska:
I will concede your argument. The murder occurred in the storeroom, correct?

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You were surprisingly quick to concede.
Franziska:
I simply cannot deny facts that are backed by evidence. ...That is all. You have proven that the murder occurred in the storeroom.
Franziska:
That would mean the culprit is someone who participated in the auction.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The culprit participated in the auction... I'd like to hear your basis for this claim.
Franziska:
When I spoke with the staff of this building, not a single one mentioned the storeroom. The storeroom's existence must have only been known to a select few.
Edgeworth:
And that's where the items for the auction were being stored...
Franziska:
I see you understand. Yes, the culprit participated in the auction.
Franziska:
If that photographer is correct, the victim was the Conductor, and the culprit was a customer.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, you're saying that the victim was the auction's Conductor?
Franziska:
Right, and the culprit...
Lotta:
Hey, ain't ya the one who told her that just a moment ago!?
Edgeworth:
Yes. That's right; however, I was simply making sure her logic is clear...
Lotta:
That ain't right... Yer doin' it wrong. This is the part where yer supposed to say "I dun goofed."
Franziska:
The culprit was a customer participating in the black market auction.
Lotta:
What in tarnation!? Now you've done it! Don't cover for him!
Franziska:
Of course... that is only if this photographer's testimony is need true.
Edgeworth:
(I can't tell whether they're on good or bad terms...)
Franziska:
The issue here is the culprit's actions.
Franziska:
The culprit waited for the victim in the storeroom, where the goods were delivered.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Hart was in the storeroom at the time. Could the culprit really have been waiting there?
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
I don't know where she was hiding, but... ...since you've seen it, you must know as well. There are numerous hiding places in that storeroom.
Edgeworth:
So the culprit was hiding while they waited for the victim to arrive...
Franziska:
I believe the crime occurred after the auction ended. After all, the victim was the organizer of the auction, the Conductor. During the auction, the organizer would have to be in front of the customers the entire time.
Edgeworth:
(After the auction ended...?) Please add that statement to your testimony.
Adds statement:
"I believe the crime occurred after the auction ended."
Franziska:
I believe the crime occurred after the auction ended.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The victim was killed after the auction ended... Are you certain of that?
Franziska:
The victim was the Conductor. That is the only possibility.
Ema:
Without the Conductor, the auction couldn't have been held.
Edgeworth:
The auction couldn't have been held...? (Something seems odd in this testimony...)
Present Lotta's Testimony
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"As I thought, you are one step behind."
Franziska:
Then, they stabbed the victim in the chest with the candelabra in the storeroom.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The candelabra in the storeroom? How do you know that?
Franziska:
If the murder weapon had been prepared in advance... ...the victim's chest would have been stabbed with something completely different. Based on the culprit's auctions, it's clear where the murder weapon came from.
Ema:
There were signs suggesting that the candelabra was once placed in the storeroom, too.
Franziska:
The items in the storeroom were intended to be sold as goods in the auction. Although, where the murder weapon was procured from is not the main issue here.
Edgeworth:
(At first glance, her logic seems to hold up, but something just doesn't feel quite right... I'll need to draw out more information.)
Edgeworth:
As I thought, you are one step behind.
Franziska:
What did you say...!?
Edgeworth:
The victim was not the Conductor, and I have proof. Ms. Hart's testimony.
Franziska:
That photographer's testimony is not truthworthy!
Lotta:
What're ya'll sayin'!? I'm a bona fide journa- OWWW!
Franziska:
Cease your idle chatter!
Lotta:
YEEEHAAAWW!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Franziska, calm down and listen. Ms. Hart witnessed a part of the murder. The main point here is that after witnessing the murder, she says the auction continued...
Lotta:
That's right! Sure as can be! They all just kept goin' on shamelessly!
Edgeworth:
Do you think the auction could have continued without someone conducting it? If the victim was not the Conductor, the person killed must have been... a customer!
Franziska:
Nooooooooooo!
Edgeworth:
As I said from the beginning, Kay is not the culprit. After all, she herself was attacked by someone and lost consciousness. In which case, that would also make her a victim.
Ray:
If the auction continued after the incident occurred...
Edgeworth:
Yes. And the victim was not the Conductor, but a customer...

That's enough!

Blaise:
I had come to light a fire under you, but it seems I've found an unexpected bonus. To think that the criminal who has become the talk of the town would be here, of all places.
Courtney:
Everyone! Restrain the suspect at once.
Edgeworth:
Please wait! Kay Faraday is not the cul-
Blaise:
Silence!
Edgeworth:
...!
Blaise:
This is quite troubling, Edgeworth. Didn't I tell you earlier? The P.I.C. desires a swift resolution to this case. If it's not, we could lose our trust with the public. They'd call us the Waste of Time Committee. Y'know, it's troubling for me as well, that sort of thing... And at my age too... *sniff* *sniff*
Courtney:
And on top of that... an illegal investigation is not something that I can overlook. Have you forgotten? You are no longer a prosecutor. You have lost all your authority. Furthermore... you have aided a criminal in evading the law.
Blaise:
Yes, yes. That's right. You're so reliable, Courtney.
Edgeworth:
I am aware of the consequences of my actions. You may punish me as you wish. However... ...we have found a new suspect. It's the person pictured here. Kay Faraday was attacked by this person and...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
There is no need for your explanation. Just recently, a red raincoat was discovered in the vicinity of this building. The victim's blood and cherry blossom petals were found on the hood.
Edgeworth:
Cherry blossom petals? (Now that you mention it, on the viewing platform...)
Courtney:
Yes. They probably stuck on due to the blood. They were littered around the bloodstain.
Blaise:
And we've received the forensic report on the blood, y'know. There's no doubt about it. The person in that photo is the victim, Jill Crane.
Edgeworth:
Wh-What did you saaaaaaay!?
Red Raincoat data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
I-Impossible! That would completely destroy the foundations of our logic. We had believed the person in the red raincoat was the culprit. And now it turns out... that person is actually the murder victim. W-Wait. If that's the case, then the prime suspect would be...!
Courtney:
Ms. Faraday. You met a person in a red raincoat on the rooftop, did you not?
Kay:
Yes. I did, but...
Courtney:
The person in the red raincoat was the murder victim. And Kay Faraday came into contact with that person. Since one of the parties is now dead, what happened next should be clear...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Kay was attacked by that person! As the victim, it would be impossible for her to be the culprit!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
There is no evidence she was attacked, is there? Furthermore, we must consider the possibility that the victim fought back.
Edgeworth:
It's far too early to come to that conclusion! Kay is not the criminal!
Kay:
......You're wrong.
Gumshoe:
K-Kay?
Kay:
That's... wrong. Even though I don't want to believe it myself... After hearing about the raincoat, I finally remembered. I only remember a little, but... from what I saw that night... ...the culprit... ...is me. I remember looking down... at the person in the red raincoat... Mr. Edgeworth! It was me! The culprit was me all along!
Edgeworth:
That can't be right!
Kay:
Then, why? Why do I have that memory? That person collapsed before my eyes... engulfed in a pool of blood... Why didn't I do anything? It must have been... because I killed her...
Courtney:
It is clear to me, the validity of Kay Faraday's memory.
Gumshoe:
Didn't you doubt it until just now, pal!?
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Congratulations, Ms. Faraday. Your courage will surely allow you to be forgiven. Now, let us rejoice in the blessings of the Goddess of Law!
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Allow me to give my opinion as an international prosecutor! Her actions as a criminal are...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Hurry! Arrest Kay Faraday at once!
Franziska:
How dare you behave that way before me...!?
Edgeworth:
You're being too forceful! Further verification is necessary! I'd even go so far to say this is unlawful!
Courtney:
Unfortunately, the law does not side with you.
Blaise:
It sides with me, y'see. But y'know, the beautiful bond between you two has been etched deeply into my heart.
Courtney:
That reminds me... we seem to have forgotten one additional suspect.
Blaise:
Edgeworth. That's you.
Gumshoe:
What's that, pal!? Mr. Edgeworth hasn't done anything wrong!
Blaise:
I beg to differ! ...That's right. Y'see... He's no longer a prosecutor, sadly enough.
Courtney:
Your actions have gone too far this time. An illegal investigation, and assisting in the escape of a criminal... I cannot even think of you as a former prosecutor! Now, humbly accept your punishment!
Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
Blaise:
Oh, yes, that's right. I believe the plan of today was to hold your hearing before the P.I.C. Why don't we leave the hearing for tomorrow. Even though the result is already crystal clear. You should think long and hard about what you've done. ...Very long and very hard.
Courtney:
Court is now adjourned!
To be continued.
April 6Detention CenterHolding Cell
Edgeworth:
(This is the second time I've been in this cell... ...All of my evidence has been taken from me. The only thing I have left is Kay's Yatagarasu's badge. I'm worried about Kay... Is she alright?)
Kay:
...the culprit... ...is me. I remember looking down... at the person in the red raincoat... Mr. Edgeworth! It was me! The culprit was me all along!
Edgeworth:
......
Guard:
You have a visitor. Please hurry out.
Edgeworth:
A visitor? Who could it be...?
Guard:
Someone by the name of Dick Gumshoe. Will you turn him down?
Edgeworth:
...No. (It will be hard to face him, though.)
April 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Guard:
Wait there.
Edgeworth:
(Hm. He's not going to stay and keep watch...?)
???:
Pardon me.
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney!
Courtney:
Hush. Please, have a seat.
Edgeworth:
Why are you here? I was told the detective had come.
Courtney:
If I didn't instruct them to tell you that, you wouldn't be sitting here right now.
Edgeworth:
(I can't think of anything she'd need from me at this point. I should try to figure out what she wants...)
The visit
Courtney:
Your visitation rights have been restricted to begin with.
Edgeworth:
It's as if I'm some monstrous criminal... I suppose my credibility has hit rock bottom.
Courtney:
But of course. Your friends have fared a little better though. That lawyer and that girl were both quite worked up.
Edgeworth:
(Mr. Shields and Ema...)
Courtney:
When I last saw them, they were giving one of the guards quite an earful.
Edgeworth:
What!? You don't mean...!
Courtney:
Be grateful. The Goddess of Law has been quite busy. They were spared punishment.
Edgeworth:
...It certainly seems like you have plenty of time for small talk.
Courtney:
Oh, yes. Prosecutor von Karma is presently continuing the investigation. You were worried about them, right?
Edgeworth:
(I guess she saw right through me...)
Judge Courtney's goal
Leads to:
"Let's cut to the chase. Exactly what are you planning?"
Present
Yatagarasu's Badge
Courtney:
If it's about Kay Faraday, I believe she's being interrogated as we speak.
Edgeworth:
You people... Do you have any idea what you're doing? How dare you arrest an innocent person!
Courtney:
That's not a very nice thing to say... I would ask that you correct your statement. She is merely someone you want to believe is innocent. ...Am I wrong?
Edgeworth:
There is no decisive evidence to prove that she's the culprit.
Courtney:
There is no evidence to prove her innocence either... Enough of this. It's pointless.
Edgeworth:
...!
Courtney:
The girl will be judged. There is nothing you can do to stop that. That's all there is to say about that. Now, let's get to the real issue at hand.
Edgeworth:
Let's cut to the chase. Exactly what are you planning?
Courtney:
I am not planning anything. There is merely a question I wish to ask.
Edgeworth:
...You're asking me?
Courtney:
Yes, of course. Who else is here? Objectively speaking... you are a clever individual, and you have a sharp mind. As a prosecutor, you are highly talented and capable.
Edgeworth:
Are you being ironic? Your sarcasm falls short.
Courtney:
I am being completely sincere. And that is why I cannot understand. Take this case, for example. You're up against the P.I.C. There is no chance for you to come out on top. Even a child could understand. And yet, you...
Edgeworth:
Heh... Perhaps my younger self would not have done something so reckless. ...The me from before had power. That's why I thought justice was on my side. Just like you right now...
Courtney:
.....
Edgeworth:
However, because of a certain man, my self-centered sense of justice was broken down. Ever since then... I began to see people in a different sight. I'm able to serve as a prosecutor only because of the support of the people around me. People like Detective Gumshoe, and all the other investigators. And... Kay, as well. Honestly, even I'm surprised at how much I have changed...
Courtney:
I see... Is that how it is? I've come to understand you a little more.
Edgeworth:
Understand me? Not likely. Someone like you, who forces her own sense of justice onto others could never understand.
Courtney:
...I wonder about that. Is that what you think?
Edgeworth:
...?
Courtney:
If I could say one thing... ...it would be that this conversation has been very interesting. ...That is all.
Edgeworth:
..........
Courtney:
Our conversation is coming to an end, however... I have one last thing to tell you. The date of your hearing has been set. I came here today to inform you. Today. In the P.I.C. meeting room. May you humbly accept your fate.
Edgeworth:
...If that's all you wanted to say, couldn't you have just sent a messenger?
Courtney:
The holy words of the Goddess of Law simply cannot be entrusted to others. With that, Mr. Edgeworth, I bid you farewell. I shall be seeing you again later.
April 6Detention CenterHolding Cell
Bars
Edgeworth:
There's a poster hanging in the hallway. "The Dice N' Silce Game! Roll the dice and decide your daily menu... The Dice N' Silce Game has been cancelled due to the warden's arrest. We sincerely apologize to everyone who was looking forward to it." (There's no need to apologize for canceling such a silly game!)
Sink
Edgeworth:
(I mustn't neglect my personal appearance just because I'm in a holding cell. Prosecutor or not, this is my personal duty...) Hm? My collar is slightly bent! ........There. A well-groomed appearance reflects a well-groomed mind. (From here on, I'll need to focus myself more than ever!)
Desk
Edgeworth:
(There's a dining menu sitting on the desk. It seems I can get food delivered if I pay for it.) ...Let's see. Moldy white bread lunch set. Switch to moldy whole-wheat bread for an extra dollar. Oatmeal and grits set meal. For a limited time, get extra gruel at no additional cost. (Thank goodness I'm not hungry right now...)
Toilet
Edgeworth:
(There's a poster on the wall next to the toilet.) "We are currently out of toilet paper. Please be prepared if you wish to use the toilet." (What does it mean by "be prepared"...!)
Bed
Edgeworth:
It's a simple bed. I don't expect it to be very comfortable to sleep on. (If it were Detective Gumshoe, he would probably snore loudly while sleeping like a dog. I may never get a chance to work with him again... However, this is the path I chose! I won't regret it!)
Window
Edgeworth:
There are thick bars placed securely on the window. (That reminds me, I watched a movie that had iron bars just like these. It was about a plan to escape a prison by filing down the iron bars. Of course, I wouldn't do such a thing. I don't even have a file.) ...No. Even if I had one, I still wouldn't do it!
(Examining bars, desk, and bed leads to:)
Edgeworth:
(Another visitor...?) Kay!
Kay:
Ah...
Edgeworth:
It seems you're alright. I'm relieved... for now.
Blaise:
Y'know, this is kinda touching... *Sob* *Sob* *Sob*
Edgeworth:
You look a little down, Kay... Please, cheer up. You didn't do anything wrong. I guarantee it.
Kay:
...Please, just accept it. I am a murderer.
Edgeworth:
That's not true! Why won't you believe in yourself!?
Kay:
What should I believe in? I mean... there's nothing...
Edgeworth:
There's nothing to believe in? That's not true. Before you lost your memories, you literally jumped into my life. As a result, your words and actions have become engraved in my memories... That's the mark you left behind. How can you call that "nothing"? I believe in your innocence. That's why you must believe in yourself as well.
Kay:
.....Thank you. But, it's no use. Look at all the misfortune I've brought upon you. If you can, please forget it all. Your memories of Kay Faraday...
Edgeworth:
Kay!
Blaise:
Y'know, this takes me back. In my youth, I too was a gallant...
Edgeworth:
Is this... the kind of justice that the P.I.C. seeks?
Blaise:
Hmm... Justice, huh? I wonder...
Edgeworth:
(This man, what is he planning? Why is he pushing things forward so forcefully...? It all seems too unnatural. Is there a hidden agenda? There's no time left! It's all or nothing now!)
Blaise:
Well then, I must take my leave...
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
No matter how you look at it, Kay's arrest was unnatural... There must be something behind it.
4 CHESS PIECES
Blaise:
Hey, hey. I'm a busy man, y'know. I'm kind of a big deal, y'see. I trust this won't take up too much of my time.
Edgeworth:
(In order to make it out of this situation, I must break through his defenses!) There are plenty of things I want to ask, but my time is limited.  First, I'll ask about why he rushed the arrest. I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.
Begin Logic Chess
Why did you rush her arrest...?
Leads to:
"Why did you rush her arrest!? I would like a clear explanation."
Kay is not the culprit!
Edgeworth:
Kay is not the culprit!
Blaise:
My, my. That's a rather bold claim, y'know? Anyone can shout objections at the top of their lungs, y'see. Mr. Former Prodigy Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
Urgh...! It's no use... I don't have enough information! My chance will come, sooner or later...! And when it does, I mustn't let it slip by.
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Why did you rush her arrest!? I would like a clear explanation.
Blaise:
Explanation? What are you talking about?
Edgeworth:
Don't play dumb with me! You clearly did not follow the proper procedures!
Blaise:
OK, OK. Maybe you should pipe down a bit. Do you even know the position you're in?
I'm a prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Blaise:
My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.
Edgeworth:
(Argh... That was a wasted remark.) I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.

Suppose we let the criminal escape. What do you think will happen?
Edgeworth:
...What will happen?

I would be made to take responsibility, y'see. I do hope you understand.
And what of it!?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!

My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.

Just take my advice and stay out of this, if you know what's good for you.
Edgeworth:

Blaise:
Y'know... This is so pitiful... It brings me to tears. Why won't you just give up...? Things were finally going well.
Perhaps I should give up.
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!

Things were... going well?
Leads to:
"Things were going well, you say? That's a strange way to put it."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:

Blaise:
Huh? So you've grown silent. Does this mean I can go now?
Edgeworth:
Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Things were going well, you say? That's a strange way to put it. It almost sounds as if you personally wanted Kay to be arrested... ...far more than necessary. Haven't you lost your impartiality?
1 PIECE BROKEN
Blaise:
Hmm, you think so? That certainly wasn't my intention, y'see... Edgeworth, my boy, you're reading too much into it.
Edgeworth:
He skillfully avoided the issue... However, I still have some serious doubts about Kay's arrest. Next, I shall ask him if the investigation was sufficient. I can't miss even the tiniest piece of information. That's the only way to break through this situation!
How long did you investigate?
Edgeworth:
How much time was spent on the investigation?
Before clearing "Was it under your authority?"
Blaise:
Y'know, I wonder about that...? I don't really remember, y'see.
Edgeworth:
There is no way I can accept such a careless answer!
Blaise:
Like I said, I don't remember. My memory's not as sharp as it used to be, y'see. Sometimes I even forgot my own son's name.
Edgeworth:
I don't care about your idiot son! I want your answer regarding the investigation!
Blaise:
Y-Yes, he really is an idiot... Even though I don't remember raising him like that. *Sob* *Sob* *Sob*
Edgeworth:
There's no end to this... He just keeps on dodging the question. Let's try another line of attack to make him take me seriously.
Leads back to first
After clearing "Was it under your authority?"
Leads to:
"Hrmmm. Well, well. Aren't you an impertinent one?"
Was it under your authority?
Edgeworth:
It's hard to say that the investigation was sufficient! The arrest... Was it under your authority!
Blaise:
My, my. Do I really look that important?
Edgeworth:
The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee Chairman... It's quite a prominent title. Not that I care much for it.
Blaise:
Th-That was rather blunt. I'm so shocked, I could cry...
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry... Flattery was never my forte.
Blaise:
I-If you keep talking me like that t-towards me... ...y-you'll never get your prosecutor's badge back, y'know...
That would be terrible!
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!

Let me make this clear right now. I do not live for the sake of my badge! Status means nothing to me. Do you understand?
Blaise:
...... Young... So young... Let me teach you something as your senior in life. What you're saying right now... It's far too naïve, y'see.
Edgeworth:
The look in his eyes has changed! He might respond differently to some of my questions now. This is my chance!
Leads back to first
Was it under your authority? (after clearing this option)

Edgeworth:
What a coincidence. I feel the same way. Answer me! Was the investigation sufficient?

Young folks always live life in the fast lane... That's why I like to bully 'em. You'll regret this, soon enough.
I'm the one bullying you!

Edgeworth:
It's simple. The truth is fading away... That's all there is to it!
Blaise:
I see. I'm starting to understand what kind of person you are. But y'know, it's all useless. It's enough to make me cry. G-Give it up. That girl's guilt has already been d-decided.

If I put together what you have told me up until now... ...I cannot help but say that there is no basis for Kay's arrest.
Blaise:
Yes, yes. I understand, I understand, y'see. But y'know, it doesn't really matter either way. You can't overturn her arrest.
Edgeworth:
How irresponsible! Do you still claim to be a man of the law?
Blaise:
My, my. Those are some harsh words, y'know? Hrmm... Y'know, you're starting to make me a little angry.

Aren't you just pretending to be busy?
Blaise:
...Th-That's cruel, y'know... This old chunk of coal has been working like a dog. Pretending... Just what do you think that would accomplish?
You don't want to talk about it, do you?
Leads to:
"You don't want to talk about the case..."
Are you trying to get my sympathy?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Blaise:
My, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.
Edgeworth:
(Argh... That was a wasted remark.) I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.

Huh? So you've grown silent. Does this mean I can go now?
Edgeworth:
Mmph... I was too passive... I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.

Edgeworth:
You don't want to talk about the case... Isn't that... why you're trying to get away from this place?
Blaise:
How sad. Yes. How sad indeed... Do you really suspect little old me?
Edgeworth:
I do suspect you. And I'm confident about it. There was clearly no basis for Kay's arrest.
Blaise:
My, my. Have you forgotten? Wasn't there evidence? The mask, the letter, and the corsage... All were found in the girl's possession. Not to mention, she even confessed. All of this serves to prove her crime.
Edgeworth:
That's...
Blaise:
...Any objections?
OBJECTION

Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!

Blaise:
I see. You're a sharp one, aren't you? Y'know, I wish my son could learn from you... ...because he's a real idiot... *Sob* *Sob* *Sob*
Edgeworth:
I'm not interested in your son! Who made the decision for the arrest!?

Y-You're a bad man, y'know... Don't you already know? The one who ordered her arrest...
Obviously, it was you!

1 PIECE BROKEN
Blaise:
Ouch. You make it sound like I committed some kind of injustice. Guess I'll have to clear that up. My honor's at stake here, y'see. Very well. I'll continue to play along with you... until you are satisfied.
Edgeworth:
What is most crucial here is... ...how much this man knows about this case. If I can get him to reveal that...! It's do or die! If I can overcome this, I'll reach the truth!
About Kay...
Edgeworth:
The suspect. Regarding Kay... How much do you know about her?
Blaise:
She's the suspect in this case. That's all I know, y'see. Scout's Honor.

Checkmate...!

You arrested Kay, even when you knew of the existence of the true culprit...? Don't toy with me! There is no way such an act would be tolerated!

And it burns me up inside! I'm not the most perfect piece of work, y'know. So I can't forgive such youthfulness. You say the truth is important. But y'know... Once you know the real value of the truth holds, I wonder if you can still say the same thing?
Edgeworth:
...What are you trying to say?
Blaise:
When you get to where I am, you can just create your own truths. Anytime you want. Kay Faraday is the culprit. That was a truth that I simply manufactured out of thin air.
Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
Blaise:
...Good, very good. That face. That expression! You were such a desperate one, y'see. That's why I really wanted to bully you, y'know? Y'see, even if you know the truth, there is simply nothing you can do. And that's the real value of truth. So shocking that it's to die for, y'know?

Why don't you pursue the true culprit!? How much of the truth do you know!?

(Everything will be decided in today's deliberation... Kay's innocence... I will definitely prove it!)
April 6, 8:30 AMGrand TowerP.I.C. Meeting Room
Blaise:
Ten members are present. The quorum has been met... From here on out, let the council begin! Today's deliberation shall be about... Miles Edgeworth's aptitude and ability as a prosecutor! Let our members discuss this matter with a clear conscience of the Goddess of Law!
Edgeworth:
(A clear conscience... Don't make me laugh.)
Blaise:
Courtney, please give us your report.
Courtney:
On April 5th, Prosecutor Edgeworth carried out an illegal investigation and resisted arrest. He was arrested by two of our members who caught him in the act: myself and Blaise Debeste. Prosecutor Edgeworth disrupted the investigation of Attorney Jill Crane's murder. He claims that the culprit, Kay Faraday, was arrested without sufficient evidence. Even now, his claim remains unchanged.
Blaise:
Tell us more... about the murder incident.
Courtney:
On April 5th, the victim's body was found here, in the P.I.C. meeting room. Regarding the details...
Debeste:
I, Sebastian Debeste, the best prosecutor, will enlighten you!
Courtney:
The prosecutor in charge, Sebastian Debeste, will explain the rest of the details.
Debeste:
The murder happened on the night of April 4th. The victim was one Jill Crane. On the same night, a black market auction was being held in this very meeting room. I guess Ms. Crane was taking part in the auction. Yup.
Courtney:
The murder occurred in the middle of the auction, did it not?
Debeste:
When Ms. Crane was found, she was dressed like the Conductor of the auction. However, based on the fact that the auction continued after the murder occurred... ...I deduced that Ms. Crane could not have been the Conductor.
Edgeworth:
(You weren't the one who made that deduction...)
Courtney:
Sebastian, please show everyone the basis for the arrest of the culprit.
Debeste:
You got it, Justine. Kay Faraday was unable to bear the weight of her good conscience......
Courtney:
I believe you mean her "guilty" conscience.
Debeste:
Yes. It was her guilty conscience that drove her to confess the crime. According to her confession, on the roof of this building... ...she met a figure in a red raincoat on the viewing platform.
Blaise:
So Crane was wearing a red raincoat?
Courtney:
Yes, that's correct. The culprit used the Conductor's clothes as a red herring to mislead us... At the time of the murder, Ms. Crane was wearing a red raincoat.
Debeste:
It was I who discovered the raincoat near this building!
Edgeworth:
(He did? I'm sure it was the forensics team who found it...)
Courtney:
To be more precise, it was the forensics team under Sebastian's orders who discovered it.
Edgeworth:
(I thought as much!)
Debeste:
According to the blood analysis... ...the person in the red raincoat and Ms. Crane were the same person! The decisive evidence is the culprit's own confession. She testified that she killed her! That's right, the culprit is Kay Faraday! It couldn't have been anyone else but her!
Blaise:
Well then, Edgeworth. If you have any objections, let's hear them.
Edgeworth:
.....I have no objections.
Blaise:
I see, I see. It seems all the fight's gone out of you after your little overnight stay...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I have no objections to your claim that I investigated illegally. I admit to that. However! I object to the claim that Kay is the culprit!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
I will testify that Sebastian's investigation was fair and just.
Debeste:
Ha ha ha ha ha! Of course it was, Justine! Don't you know that I'm the fairest of them all!
Blaise:
Edgeworth, my boy. Despite how things may seem, I actually kinda like you. If...! And this is just an "if", y'see. If you were to withdraw your objection... ...you might be sitting on this side of the bench tomorrow.
Edgeworth:
.........
Blaise:
I'll ask you one more time, Edgeworth. Do you have any objections?
Edgeworth:
...Don't take me for a fool.
Courtney:
I'd advise you to watch what you say!
Edgeworth:
This man is the one who should watch what he's saying! I'm talking about the case! Not about a chair! I demand a testimony! By all means, let me hear that! I want to know how the P.I.C. understands this case!
Blaise:
A testimony from us, eh? Fine then. If that's what it takes to make you happy. Courtney, give him the materials from the investigation.
Courtney:
Sir? But, that's...
Blaise:
It's the end of the line for him. I'll let him go out in a blaze of glory.
Courtney:
...If you insist, Mr. Chairman.
Received evidence from Judge Courtney.
Blaise:
Why don't we have... Courtney give the testimony?
Edgeworth:
I have no objections.
Kay:
M-Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Don't worry, Kay. You just watch from over there.
-- Summary of the Case --
Courtney:
Ms. Crane went to the black market auction as a customer.
The red raincoat was one of the items up for auction...
We believe that she left her seat after winning the bid for it.
The only exit from the storeroom is the hatch that leads to the viewing platform.
Ms. Crane went out to the viewing platform, where she was attacked by Kay Faraday.
That was how she met her end. And that concludes my summary of the case.
Edgeworth:
The red raincoat was up for auction...? Is that a fact?
Courtney:
It is quite likely. The red raincoat had been a piece of evidence... ...in the assassination attempt on the President of Zheng Fa, as you well know. Originally, it should have been stored in an appropriate place... But when I asked about it... I learned that it went missing.
Edgeworth:
And it somehow made its way to the black market auction... Certainly, a natural conclusion.
Blaise:
My, my. Well done, Courtney. Your explanation is as clear as ever.
Courtney:
...I am much obliged. Prosecutor Edgeworth, will you concede defeat now?
Edgeworth:
Heh. Sorry, but I don't plan on it.
Courtney:
I see... I am relieved.
Edgeworth:
(...Relieved? What does she mean? Come to think of it... Her reason for questioning me yesterday remains a mystery. Just what is she thinking?)
Rebuttal
-- Summary of the Case --
Courtney:
Ms. Crane went to the black market auction as a customer.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you're saying that a member of the P.I.C. was involved in illicit dealings?
Courtney:
Regarding that... I... I have no response.
Blaise:
He's right, y'know. After this hearing is over, we're going to have to clean up our act.
Courtney:
A splendid decision, Mr. Chairman!
Blaise:
Now, now. It is only natural, y'see. There's no need to flatter me, y'know? But, y'know, that has nothing to do with you at all, Edgeworth. Because by then, you won't even be a prosecutor anymore, y'see? Well, now that this tearful business has been cleared up...
Courtney:
Yes, sir. I will continue.
Courtney:
The red raincoat was one of the items up for auction...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, the red raincoat was also up for auction?
Courtney:
Yes. It had belonged to Shelly de Killer.
Blaise:
Based on the circumstances, we must consider that it was an item up for auction, y'see?
Edgeworth:
! That was what he wore when he targeted the president of Zheng Fa...! (There was a mannequin that was positioned unnaturally amongst the auction goods... That may have been where the red raincoat had been on display.) Do you know how the goods were procured?
Courtney:
We're currently investigating it... But, it's none of your concern, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Soon, you will be nothing more than an ordinary individual. And then you will be finished.
Edgeworth:
(It seems the results of this deliberation have already been decided.) ...Enough about me. Please continue your testimony.
Courtney:
Since the raincoat had been up for auction...
Courtney:
We believe that she left her seat after winning the bid for it.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Why would the victim immediately leave her seat?
Courtney:
That had to do with how the auction was conducted. It seems that after the winning bid, the winner was required to pay for the item immediately.
Edgeworth:
(That matches up with Ms. Hart's testimony.)
Courtney:
We believe that Ms. Crane paid her bid for the raincoat... ...and then immediately tried to leave the auction.
Courtney:
The only exit from the storeroom is the hatch that leads to the viewing platform.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The victim was a P.I.C. member. Couldn't she have also just left from the meeting room?
Courtney:
If she had done so during the auction... ...then its existence would have been revealed to the public.
Edgeworth:
(Since Ms. Hart knew about it, it seems the cat is already out of the bag...)
Courtney:
The customers were required to enter and exit from the hatch. Ms. Crane was simply following protocol... Considering where the murder took place, she must have tried to leave through there.
Courtney:
Ms. Crane went out to the viewing platform, where she was attacked by Kay Faraday.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Why would Kay do such a thing?
Courtney:
We intend to question her about that later.
Edgeworth:
"Later?" That seems to be your favorite time for interrogations.
Courtney:
If the culprit was aware that the customers were required to exit from the hatch... ...it would have been easy to lie in wait for an ambush. Ms. Crane was attacked when she was leaving the hatch...

Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Judge Courtney, I have found it to be strange for a while now."
Courtney:
That was how she met her end. And that concludes my summary of the case.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
"Met her end", what do you mean by that?
Courtney:
She passed away... or to be more precise, she was murdered.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The candelabra was one of the items in the auction. Therefore, Kay should not have been able to get her hands on it.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
If she was able to lie in wait for the attack, then she must have known about the storeroom. If she sneaked into the storeroom during the auction, she could have obtained it.
Blaise:
Now, if we only had some way to know for sure... Where the candelabra was during the entire auction, y'know? How about it?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... There is... no such evidence...
Courtney:
My apologies. We hope to find that evidence soon.
Blaise:
Edgeworth. It's too bad, y'know? It seems you won't be able to use this line of attack.
Edgeworth:
(The victim encountered the culprit on top of the roof and the crime occurred there... According to her reasoning, the murder took place at the viewing platform. But was that really the case? Some piece of evidence must tell the whole story behind it. I should try looking again.)
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, I have found it to be strange for a while now. Why is Ms. Hart here with us?
Courtney:
She is an eyewitness to this case. Isn't it only natural for her to be in attendance?
Lotta:
Aww... shucks, ha ha... I reckon I'm more of an earwitness than an eyewitness.
Edgeworth:
...Heh. It seems that gaining the trust of others isn't your strong point, Judge Courtney.
Courtney:
Perhaps I simply do not wish to be as tactless as you.
Edgeworth:
It appears you have failed to get the witness to tell you the most vital information. Please look at this photo. This was taken by Ms. Hart.
Courtney:
This photo seems to have been taken in the storeroom. And, what of it?
Edgeworth:
According to your reasoning, the incident took place on the viewing platform. However, Ms. hart encountered the incident in the storeroom! That's right, it had taken place just before this photo was taken!
Debeste:
W-Wait...! If that's true, then Justine's reasoning...!
Edgeworth:
Exactly, it does not hold up.
Debeste:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Hart, allow me to ask you again. You saw the person in the photo with your own eyes, correct?
Lotta:
I sure did. I seen 'em plain as day with my own two eyes.
Edgeworth:
And what did you think at the time?
Lotta:
I figured I was about to get me a big scoop! ...Ya know?

I guess that makes sense.
Edgeworth:
...Ahem. That's not what I meant. What did you think of that person?
Lotta:
Huh? Well... I reckoned she'd help me bring home the bacon.
Edgeworth:
...Are you mocking me?
Lotta:
Aww shucks, don't make that scary ole' face. It was just a harmless little joke. The person in the red raincoat? I reckoned they were the culprit.
Edgeworth:
I hope you understand now. The crime occurred in the...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, I cannot understand your argument if you do not say it out loud. If you had simply asked, I would have been more than willing to explain.
Edgeworth:
...Explain what?
Courtney:
The sounds Ms. Hart heard may not necessarily be related to the case.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That is impossible! Enough of your excuses!
Courtney:
Was the voice that Ms. Hart heard really that of Ms. Crane?
Lotta:
Such a shady conversation must've had somethin' to do with the case!
Courtney:
What did her voice sound like?
Lotta:
H-Her voice? Well... it beats me. How was I suppos'd to know!? They were both usin' voice changers.
Courtney:
Yes. The voices Ms. Hart heard had been altered by a device. We must therefore question whether or not they have any bearing on this case.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
......Hmph.
Courtney:
You need not object just because you wish to sigh.
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, it seems I have greatly overestimated you.
Blaise:
No, no. Courtney is quite amazing, y'see.
Edgeworth:
You claim that the sounds Ms. Hart heard no bearing on this case? Even if they do not, it doesn't change the fact that the crime took place in the storeroom. At the very least, the crime must have occurred before the victim went up to the rooftop. The reason being... This evidence proves the crime occurred before the victim went up to the viewing platform!
Present bloodied hand
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"At first, I thought the person in the red raincoat was the culprit."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Could you take a look at this area?
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. What area are you referring to?
Edgeworth:
Umm... Around here somewhere?
Courtney:
Please be more specific!
Edgeworth:
Argh! (It seems I was wrong. This photo was taken after Ms. Harts heard the sounds in the storeroom. There must be something in the photo that connects the sounds to the case!)
Courtney:
As I thought, you cannot show the connection between the sounds and the case.
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. That is not true.
Leads back to:
"This evidence proves the crime occurred before the victim went up to the viewing platform!"
Edgeworth:
At first, I thought the person in the red raincoat was the culprit.
Kay:
Well... Ms. Hart's testimony certainly made it sound that way...
Edgeworth:
Precisely. It was because she saw that the person's hand... was covered in blood. Anyone who heard her testimony would have arrived at the same conclusion. The person in the red raincoat was the culprit... and the blood on their hand was the victim's. However, if the person in the red raincoat was the victim, then the situation changes completely. Since blood can be seen in this photo, it must have been taken after the crime occurred. It seems we've been under the wrong impression in regards to the victim's condition. This photo shows the true condition of the victim. The victim...
Was really the Conductor
Edgeworth:
The victim was the Conductor of the black market auction!
Kay:
According to what Ms. Hart said, even after the victim was hit... ...the auction still went on, right?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. That is correct.
Kay:
So wouldn't it be impossible for the victim to have been the Conductor?
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (I overlooked that...)
Kay:
This photo was taken after Ms. Hart heard the sounds in the storeroom. In that case, the blood on that hand must mean...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. There is only one answer. In other words, the victim...
Leads back to:
"This photo shows the true condition of the victim. The victim..."
Struck the culprit
Edgeworth:
The victim struck the culprit! That was probably when her hand got covered in blood.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. All the blood we found at the crime scene belonged to the victim. Your reasoning doesn't seem to hold up.
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (I overlooked that...)
Kay:
This photo was taken after Ms. Hart heard the sounds in the storeroom. In that case, the blood on that hand must mean...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. There is only one answer. In other words, the victim...
Leads back to:
"This photo shows the true condition of the victim. The victim..."
Was still alive after the attack
Leads to:
"The victim was definitely attacked in the storeroom."
Edgeworth:
The victim was definitely attacked in the storeroom. Immediately afterward, the victim was seen with blood on her hand. That must mean... ...the victim was still alive even after she was attacked. The blood on her hand must have come from her own wound.
Debeste:
No way! Are you saying that she died from a hand injury?
Edgeworth:
No, that is not the case. I suspect she just held her hand against the wound. It can't be seen in the photo, but at this moment, she must have already suffered a fatal wound.
Blaise:
Hoh, hoh. If that's true, then it changes a lot of things, y'know?
Edgeworth:
It seems you understand. This refutes the allegations against Kay. Kay encountered the victim after this picture was taken... I believe at that point in time, the victim was already on the verge of death. It's likely Kay just happened to be present when the victim reached the end of her strength.
Courtney:
...That is quite the coincidence.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. I can only say that she was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, it seems you have forgotten a crucial fact.
Blaise:
Ah, you mean that, right? He must be pretending that he hasn't noticed it, y'see.
Edgeworth:
What did you say...? Are you implying that I forgot something?
Blaise:
Courtney. I think it's about time you gave him his last rites.
Debeste:
Hey, pops! Justine's with me, you know! Don't order her around like that!
Blaise:
Y'know... even though you're my son, you're so embarrassing.
Debeste:
I'm not embarrassing!
Edgeworth:
(...I'm sorry, but you're both rather embarrassing.)
Debeste:
Justine! Give Mr. Edgeworth his... umm...
Courtney:
Very well. I shall give him his last rites.
-- Edgeworth's Contradiction --
Courtney:
When the body was found, there were three wounds in Ms. Crane's chest.
I'm sure you're well aware what kind of wounds these were, right?
Yes, she was stabbed in the heart with the three-pronged candelabra.
Is there any person who could survive such an injury?
Please take a close look at the autopsy report. Can you still say the same thing after reading it?
Debeste:
Well done, Justine! With this, Mr. Edgeworth will...
Edgeworth:
I will offer a rebuttal, of course.
Debeste:
Why would you do that!? Didn't you hear what Justine just said?
Edgeworth:
Of course, I did. And I still plan to object to it.
Debeste:
It's not faaaaaiiiir! You're always opposing me at every turn!
Edgeworth:
It was never my intention to oppose you.

I-I see. So that's how it is. Yup, yup. After all, I'm...

Blaise:
Sebastian, maybe you should sneak a peek at the autopsy report, y'know?
Debeste:
Ummm..... Let's see here... The fatal wound was caused by the candelabra. Oooh! So that's how it was!
Courtney:
...Ahem! The cause of the wound was just as Sebastian said.
Courtney:
Yes, she was stabbed in the heart with the three-pronged candelabra.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So the cause of death was a stab wound to the heart... Is that correct?
Courtney:
Yes, the candelabra pierced right into her heart. Since this was Dr. Young's medical opinion, it must be truth.
Debeste:
The coroner's medical opinion follows my own opinion. Therefore... it's perfect.
Edgeworth:
I certainly cannot ignore the autopsy reports, however...
Debeste:
Hey! Don't ignore my opinion!

(However, if the cause of death was a stab wound to the victim's chest... ...wouldn't it contradict that piece of evidence...?)

Oooh... He's totally ignoring me! Justine! Say something!

Correct. The autopsy report itself is the foundation for my reasoning.

Courtney:
I don't find that amusing at all... I look forward to seeing you try. Nevertheless, please take a close look at the autopsy report before you make a rebuttal. Show me that your reasoning is not just mere conjecture.
Edgeworth:
...Very well.
Kay:
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
We'll be fine, Kay. There's nothing for you to worry about. (Evidence that the victim was alive after the incident... If I can just find that, Kay will be...!)
Edgeworth:
Chairman Debeste, do you know what this is?
Blaise:
It seems to be a red raincoat. How about it, Courtney?
Courtney:
The victim... Ms. Crane was wearing this earlier. Prosecutor Edgeworth. Must I repeat my explanation to you all over again?
Edgeworth:
I suppose it just might come to that. Judge Courtney, answer me this. This red raincoat was stained with blood... Do you happen to remember where specifically those bloodstains were located?
Courtney:
Of course I do. They were on the hood... W-Wait, it can't be!
Blaise:
Hm? What does this mean?
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, were there any other bloodstains besides the ones on the hood?
Courtney:
None... were detected.
Edgeworth:
Don't you think it's strange? The victim died from a stab wound to the chest. In that case, there should have been bloodstains on the front of the raincoat. However... the only blood they found was on the hood! This is a huge contradiction! The wound on the victim's head is no ordinary wound. After all, the victim sustained this wound before she was stabbed in the chest.
Courtney:
...It does appear that way, doesn't it? The victim first suffered the head wound. If she had already been stabbed in the chest, the raincoat would have been stained with blood... Therefore, it is unthinkable that her chest was stabbed before she stuffed the head wound. So the order of the wounds would be: first the head, followed by the chest. However, does that really change the situation?
Edgeworth:
With this, a contradiction is born. One that overturns all of our assumptions up until now...
Courtney:
Is the change really that great? I look forward to hearing it. Well then, this contradiction, why don't you show it to me? With evidence!
Edgeworth:
Which piece of evidence shows the contradiction that arises from the order of the wounds?
Present Autopsy Report
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is the autopsy report written by Dr. Young."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence shows the huge contradiction.
Courtney:
I have absolutely no idea what you are trying to say.
Kay:
I'm sorry, me too...
Lotta:
Same here!
Debeste:
...M-Me too!
Edgeworth:
Gwaaah! (So it wasn't this!? ...It is unthinkable that her chest was stabbed before she suffered the head wound. And thus, a major contradiction is born within that piece of evidence.)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. There was no contradiction after all, was there?
Edgeworth:
On the contrary, Judge Courtney. If the victim sustained her head wound before she was stabbed in the chest... ...a huge contradiction arises.
Leads back to:
"Which piece of evidence shows the contradiction that arises from the order of the wounds?"
Edgeworth:
This is the autopsy report written by Dr. Young. According to this... ...the head wound was postmortem.
Courtney:
But that's not what the raincoat shows...
Edgeworth:
Exactly, it's the exact opposite.
Courtney:
Bailiff! Hurry and summon Dr. Bonnie Young at once!  Until we hear what she has to say, we cannot close the curtains on this case!
Officer:
Yes, ma'am! Understood!
Courtney:
Dr. Young is a busy person. It will take some time for her to arrive. In the meantime... let us try viewing this case from another angle. There's something that's been on my mind. One of the key figures in this case... The "Conductor". We still don't know who that person is.
Debeste:
Now that you mention it! Even after our investigation, we still have no idea who it is.
Courtney:
The Conductor has come up time and time again during this hearing. However, at this point in time, their identity remains a mystery. How about it? Do you have any ideas?
Edgeworth:
I'm still not sure at the moment. However... ...there is someone I have in mind. A certain individual involved with this case, who might know something about it.
Debeste:
Who's that...?
Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste! I demand your testimony!
Debeste:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat!
Blaise:
........
Debeste:
Don't say such a stupid thing! Why would you suspect pops!?
Courtney:
Are you trying to cast suspicion towards the Chairman of the P.I.C.? Do you understand... what that means?
Edgeworth:
Status and prestige mean nothing before the truth. That man is trying to pin the crime on Kay! The evidence that was in Kay's possession: the ticket stub, the mask, the corsage... These items did not come into her possession out of her own volition. By some method, that man purposely planted them on her personage.
Courtney:
........ It is hard to believe such a sudden accusation... but I'll ask just in case. Why... would he do that?
Edgeworth:
Obviously, to direct suspicion towards Kay. I succeeded in drawing out those words from him earlier.
Courtney:
Mr. Chairman, your response?
Blaise:
.........
Edgeworth:
Are you too shocked to speak?
Blaise:
.....And what of it?
Edgeworth:
...?
Blaise:
Perhaps you didn't hear me. I said, "What of it?" You say that you drew out some words from me, but you don't have a shred of proof, y'know? No one else heard it but you. It just doesn't work like that, y'see. Or do you have something else? Y'know, some kind of basis for your argument?
Edgeworth:
(This confidence... He also showed it at the cell...)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I would like you to explain once more. I trust we have your permission, Mr. Chairman.
Blaise:
But of course. I'm pretty interested in this matter myself, y'know. I'd like to know just what part of me semes criminal to Edgeworth. There's no one as honest as I am, y'see.
Edgeworth:
(How can he say that with a straight face...?) Let's start from the top... The fact that the auction was held in this room is a cause for suspicion. This is the P.I.C. meeting room. I imagine it would be difficult for non-members to enter.
Debeste:
That's why... all the members have keycards, you know.
Edgeworth:
I think we can assume that multiple auctions have been held here before. Therefore, suspecting a member of the P.I.C. would be...
Debeste:
...Debeste!
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes. Because the Conductor had to have been a P.I.C. member.
Debeste:
Wait! Nooooooooooo!
Edgeworth:
Wha... (What was that all about!?)
Debeste:
Wh-What do I do, pops? I just helped the enemy!
Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha ha. Sebastian really is an idiot, y'know. But y'see, Edgeworth, I'm not the only one with access, y'know?
Courtney:
Indeed... There are eleven members in the P.I.C. Even if we rule out the victim, Ms. Crane... there are still ten potential suspects.
It's not me!
B-B-B-But, it couldn't be the Ch-Ch-Ch-Chairman, right?
I don't know who it is, but whoever it is should just come forward!
Blaise:
Yes, yes. Everyone, just calm down, y'know? Edgeworth, is that all you got? Where's the evidence to suspect me?
Edgeworth:
......
Blaise:
Oh? So you've fallen silent. But you've gone too far, y'see. I won't forgive you anymore. It's too late for regrets, y'know? I'm a very important man, y'see. Former Chief Prosecutor and Chairman of the P.I.C.!

Think about it. We've got the suspect herself saying she killed the victim.
That's all that matters, y'see. She'll even get a lighter sentence with her confession, y'know.

Now then. If there are any contradictions, be my quest.
Edgeworth:

Kay:
That person... He's very important, isn't he? Mr. Edgeworth... It's alright. Let's just give up... Surely, I must have killed her... I can even remember it...

Don't be tied down by your muddled memories. If you want to believe in something... ...believe in your own innocence. Believe me, who believes in you!

Y'see, Edgeworth. I know you want to believe in Kay Faraday. But, y'know, to deny her own confession, I'm not sure what to make of that, y'see. It just means that you don't really trust her, y'know?

Oh my, what scary eyes you have. Please don't devour me. Ah ha ha ha...

(There is no way there is a contradiction in a testimony like this. He has underestimated me. If I can take advantage of that...!)

Even if you say that, y'know, it still won't solve anything. What good will it do to deny her confession? Sounds like nonsense to me. Wanna try asking her again? I think she'll just say that she's the murderer again, though.

Debeste:
The end... of the hearing?

Yes, yes. It seems you can be smart once in a while, Sebastian. In other words, y'see, if she confesses again... ...Kay Faraday will be found, beyond a shadow of a doubt, guilty. Yup. It's a fine idea.

Yeah, that's right.

I know what I'm asking of you is unreasonable, but please, I want you to answer me. It doesn't matter how tiny it is. Do you... Do you remember anything? Anything that would prove your innocence...!
Kay:
...Why? Why would you go that far, for me...? I... I can't do it. .....I'm sorry. .....I'm too scared to remember. Because... I might have done something even worse. If that were the case... ...I would only make things worse for you, Mr. Edgeworth. Kay Faraday must have been a despicable criminal... Someone who betrayed your trust...!
Edgeworth:
.....Don't worry. We've only known each other for a short while... but I know you very well. I'd even say that I know you better than yourself, now that you've lost your memories. You cannot possibly be the culprit. Because, your true identity is...!

Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
There's no clear evidence to prove that you're the culprit, besides your own confession. Remember what I said? You must believe in yourself. Or perhaps... you cannot trust my words?
Kay:
.....No. That's not it. It's because, you are... trying to save someone like me. You've already lost so much... All for my sake... I can't bear it anymore... Please... Please just give up.
Edgeworth:
I see now..... I thought it was strange. The reason you were acting like you wanted to be found guilty... ...was because you were concerned about me... That is just like you, Kay.
Kay:
It's because... you're a good person, Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately... I may fall short of your expectations. I am not trying to be a good person. No matter how much you may want me to give up... I'll keep trying to save you. That is the nature of who I am. Whether or not it is a burden for you is none of my concern.

Edgeworth:
...has been lacking up until now.
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
Nevertheless, y'know. Her vague memories cannot be trusted, y'know?
Courtney:
Her memories are vague? That would be bad for us as well. Didn't you say this earlier yourself, Mr. Chairman? Since we have the suspect's confession, we don't need to worry about the trivial details. If we decide to doubt her memories... ...then we must also doubt her confession, which is the main foundation of our case. Are you willing to do that, sir?
Blaise:
.....Aah. You're right. Well, never mind then. I shall leave it to you.

Thank you very much.

Hm? Do you know something about it, Justine?
Courtney:

Edgeworth:
A cherry blossom petal is stuck in its soft fur. Speaking of which, there were also some stuck on the red raincoat...
Kay:
A cherry tree... Wasn't there one blossoming on the viewing platform?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It seems safe to assume this was taken outside. (However... why would the victim be carrying something like this?)
Examine left hole
Kay:
The left horn is missing.
Edgeworth:
Hmm. There's a hole in this stuffed animal. It seems this hole is where the horn is inserted into.
Kay:
I guess its head isn't stuffed with cotton. I wonder what's inside?
Edgeworth:
(Perhaps I should examine the other side.)
Examine horn
Leads to:
"The right horn seems to be fine... but the entire balance feels a bit off."
Edgeworth:
The right horn seems to be fine... but the entire balance feels a bit off.
Kay:
This horn... It looks like you can move it.
Edgeworth:
What...!
...*bzz*...*bzzz*...
Kay:
What was that buzzing sound...?
Edgeworth:
It seems this toy is equipped with a recording device.
*bzzz*...*bzt*... And... th...
Blaise:
........
I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me.
........
Silence, huh... I've been waiting for my chance to get revenge all this time!
AAAAAAHHH... *bzz* ...*bzzz*...*bzt*...
Edgeworth:
Is this... the moment of the murder!?
Kay:
Who could have recorded something like this?
Stuffed Animal data updated in my Organizer.
Lotta:
Th... This is... There ain't no doubt about it! This here was what I heard!
Examine evidence
Examine cherry petal on Stuffed animal
Edgeworth:
A cherry blossom petal is stuck in its soft fur. According to Kay's story, this had been dropped under the cherry tree. So it's no wonder that a cherry blossom petal had gotten caught in there.
Examine left hole on Stuffed animal
Kay:
The left horn is missing. Although I am curious as to the whereabouts of the missing horn... Even if we were to find it, repairing it would be no easy task.
Horn on Stuffed Animal
Edgeworth:
We can play back the audio that was recorded by twisting this horn.
*bzzz*...*bzt*... And... th...
I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me.
........
Silence, huh... I've been waiting for my chance to get revenge all this time!
AAAAAAHHH... *bzz* ...*bzzz*...*bzt*...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
We cannot verify when these voices were recorded. It's also possible that they aren't related to the case at all. If only we had some video as well...
Lotta:
That's hogwash! I'm tellin' ya, that right there was the conversation that I heard! The victim was holdin' on to it, right? I reckon it must've been recorded when she got attacked!
Courtney:
That certainly is a possibility... However, your testimony alone is insufficient. I require something with a little more credibility.
Edgeworth:
(Again. Her words... It almost sounds as if she's trying to give me advice...) Judge Courtney. There's no mistake that those voices were from the incident. Please recall the audio that was recorded by the stuffed animal. "I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me." If we compare this part of the recording with a certain piece of evidence... we can prove it. (This evidence shows that the recording took place during the moment of the crime...!)
Present Autopsy Report
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The autopsy report? And exactly what part of the autopsy report shows that?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. What do you think of this piece of evidence?
Courtney:
Presenting something that has nothing to do with the recording will not do you any good.
Edgeworth:
Uugh! (I could've sworn it was this...)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Is there really evidence to prove that the voices were recorded during the incident?
Leads back to:
"Please recall the audio that was recorded by the stuffed animal."
Courtney:
The autopsy report? And exactly what part of the autopsy report shows that?
Edgeworth:
(This part shows that the recording took place during the moment of the crime...!)
Present "burn mark"
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I remember clearly what that voice said..."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
If you look at this part of the autopsy report, I think you will understand...
Courtney:
Specifically which part are you referring to?
Edgeworth:
Umm. Around here?
Courtney:
Even if you ask me, it will not do you any good.
Edgeworth:
Gwaah! (I guess it wasn't here...)
Kay:
Why don't we listen to the contents of the recording one more time? There might be something important.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. And it's also not too late to look over the autopsy report.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. What part of the autopsy report shows that the voices were recorded during the incident?
Leads back to:
"(This part shows that the recording took place during the moment of the crime...!)"
Edgeworth:
I remember clearly what that voice said... "You can't hide that burn from me." On the victim's hand, there was a burn mark.
Blaise:
Indeed... it just happened to match up, y'see. But, what of it?
Edgeworth:
According to Kay's testimony, the victim had been holding the stuffed animal. And, it just happened to record a characteristic of the victim. Namely, the burn.
Debeste:
That's just a coincidence! I mean... it could happen, right?
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
I do not think so. It is hard to believe that all of this is simply a coincidence. The voices on the stuffed animal were most likely recorded during the incident.
Edgeworth:
One of these voices must belong to the true culprit. From what we've heard, it must have been the one who was doing most of the talking.
Debeste:
But what's the point? In the end, we still can't tell their gender or identity, you know?
Edgeworth:
Indeed, because they had been using voice changers. It can't be helped.
Courtney:
It seems the situation has become quite clear. The conversation Ms. Hart overheard was between the culprit and Ms. Crane.
Lotta:
...That's what I've been tellin' you from the start.
Edgeworth:
And from this, we will understand a new fact.
Courtney:
Please enlighten us then. I trust you have no objections, Mr. Chairman.
Blaise:
...Do what you want.
Edgeworth:
According to Ms. Hart's testimony, just before the incident... ...two people came up from the auction hall, using the lift. It must have been the Conductor and one of the auction guests. They probably went there to settle the payment after winning a bid. And then, it was there that the crime was carried out... Since the auction continued after the crime took place... ...we are led to a single truth! (This is the new fact that we have arrived at...!)
The culprit is the Conductor
Leads to:
"Since the Conductor was the only one who could keep the auction going..."
The culprit is Jill Crane
Edgeworth:
The culprit of this case is Jill Crane. It has to be her!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. This is not the time to be joking around!
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (As I thought, this wasn't... If I organize all the information I've acquired up until now, I can only arrive at the one answer.)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Just what is this new fact you are talking about?
Leads back to:
"(This is the new fact that we have arrived at...!)"
The victim was the Conductor
Edgeworth:
The victim of this case was the Conductor!
Lotta:
That's all fine and dandy, but the auction still went on after the murder, ya know?
Edgeworth:
...Nnghhoooh! (It seems that was wrong... If I organize all the information I've acquired up until now, I can only arrive at the one answer.)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Just what is this new fact you are talking about?
Leads back to:
"(This is the new fact that we have arrived at...!)"
Edgeworth:
Since the Conductor was the only one who could keep the auction going... ...we can conclude that the deceased victim could not have been the Conductor.
Debeste:
...Umm, Justine...
Courtney:
Please be quiet here. Okay?
Edgeworth:
If the Conductor was not the victim, then they must have been the culprit!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Please wait. That alone is insufficient.
Edgeworth:
Of course. Even I do not intend to rely only upon the process of elimination.
Blaise:
.........
Edgeworth:
Certain traces left at the crime scene led me to believe that the culprit is the Conductor.
Courtney:
Well then, please show it to us.
Edgeworth:
What were the traces left at the crime scene that let me deduce the culprit is the Conductor?
Present Meeting Room Blood
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The culprit purposely left a large amount of blood in the meeting room."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is the piece of evidence that shows the culprit is the Conductor.
Debeste:
Umm, I don't quite understand.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Even if you don't understand, everyone else certainly does.
Blaise:
I think there are people besides my idiot son who don't understand, y'know.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (It seems that wasn't it... If the culprit was the Conductor, they would have wanted to hide something... I just have to present that!)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. If you say the culprit is the Conductor... ...could you present evidence to prove that?
Edgeworth:
Yes. I will show you that piece of evidence right now.
Leads back to:
"What were the traces left at the crime scene that let me deduce the culprit is the Conductor?"
Edgeworth:
The culprit purposely left a large amount of blood in the meeting room. In doing so, we were led to believe the meeting room had been the scene of the crime. It was a ruse by true culprit. To hide the blood that had fallen from the storeroom!
Courtney:
So we wouldn't find out about the existence of the black market auction... Correct?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. If the culprit had been unrelated to the auction, there would have been no need to do such a thing. Ergo, the culprit could have only been the Conductor!
Courtney:
Well then... Do you have any idea as to who the Conductor might possibly be?
Edgeworth:
The auction hall is at the P.I.C. meeting room, and furthermore, there is a storeroom above it. The Conductor must have been, at the very least, a member of the P.I.C.!
Blaise:
So..... ...in other words, you suspect me, I take it?
Edgeworth:
Isn't it natural to suspect you, the one with the most authority in the P.I.C.?
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
...You are quite capable. I'll give you that much, at least. But y'know, like I said before, you're far too naïve. .....You have nothing, y'know? There's no evidence that proves I am the culprit, y'see. If, by some chance, you do have evidence, then why don't you present it?
Edgeworth:
...Urk...! Do I have evidence that Blaise is the culprit...?
I have it
Edgeworth:
No. There is evidence. Evidence that you are the culprit.
Blaise:
Oooh. Then, why don't you show it to me? This so-called evidence.
Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste. This piece of evidence proves that you are the culprit!
Present anything
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?"
Edgeworth:
Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
Blaise:
Edgeworth. And what about it?
Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste, don't you understand? The meaning of this piece of evidence.
Blaise:
Weeell. Y'know, I can't say I do. I mean, it doesn't look like it's related at all.
Edgeworth:
Gwaaah! (So this wasn't it...! Blaise Debeste has to be the culprit. However, do I have any evidence to prove it?)
Blaise:
Edgeworth. There's no evidence to prove that I'm the culprit, y'know?
Leads back to:
"Do I have evidence that Blaise is the culprit...?"
I don't have it
Leads to:
"(Blaise himself has suggested that he is the criminal.)"
Edgeworth:
(Blaise himself has suggested that he is the criminal. He's been showing that strange self-confidence for awhile now. He knows that there is not a single piece of evidence left behind to incriminate him.)
Blaise:
Ha ha ha... If you play with fire, you're gonna get burned, Edgeworth. ...Juuust kidding, I always wanted to say that, y'know. Well then, Courtney...
Hold it!
Lotta:
I, I-I-I-I-I reckon! I just remembered somethin' too!
Debeste:
...Bwuh? You also lost your memories?
Lotta:
Naw, that ain't it. Somethin' just popped into my head right now!
Courtney:
Very well. Please tell us.
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
Courtney. Could you tell me what you are doing?
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth will not give up until we have destroyed every last possibility. I'm destroying every possibility. So that he will never oppose us again.
Blaise:
........
Edgeworth:
........
Debeste:
Justine...! I don't really know what's going on, but well said! Pops, I'm gonna help too! After all, he's the one who's wrong!
Blaise:
...Fine then. Let's hear what she has to say.
Courtney:
Well then, Ms. Hart. Please proceed.
Lotta:
S-Sure thing! Just leave it to me!
Edgeworth:
...Please make sure you only tell the truth.
Lotta:
Ain't that a matter of course! I'm a bona fide journalist of justice, ya know!
Edgeworth:
(.....Somehow I feel uneasy.)
Lotta:
Y'all sayin' the culprit was the Conductor, right? That means, the victim was a customer. Now, here's where it gets a mite strange. Ya see, there were 11 people at the auction. When the auction continued after the incident... ...I went straight on over and snuck a peek down below.
Edgeworth:
Y-You don't mean.....
Lotta:
That's exactly what I mean. All 11 people were still there, present 'n acocunted for.
Edgeworth:
Wh-aaaaaaaaaaaat!
Courtney:
Are you sure about that?
Lotta:
Sure I'm sure. I saw it with my own two eyes.
Debeste:
Umm... so it started with 11 people. And there were still 11 people after the murder... Was it a ghost!?
Blaise:
Y'know, Sebastian. Normally, a prosecutor would call that a contradiction, y'know.
Edgeworth:
W-Were there really no changes in the auction at all?
Lotta:
Really! I'm tellin' ya! The auction just went on like normal. Ah. But... there was one itty bitty thing, though.
Edgeworth:
What was it?
Lotta:
Ya know those hammers ya always see at an auction? Like the one that lady is usin' over there.
Courtney:
...An auction gavel... perhaps?
Lotta:
Yup, that's the one! All of a sudden, I couldn't hear the sound no more. It'd been bangin' away just prior to it.
Edgeworth:
(The sound of the gavel? Does that have anything to do with the case?)
Lotta's testimony updated in my Organizer.
Courtney:
If Ms. Hart's testimony is the truth, then this matter has taken a grave turn. If the victim was neither the Conductor nor a customer... ...the very foundation of Prosecutor Edgeworth's reasoning would collapse.
Edgeworth:
Nngh...!
Debeste:
Justice prevails, as they say! I hope you've learned your lesson, Mr. Edgeworth!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... There really is nothing we can do...
Edgeworth:
(It's not over yet. Some mysteries still remain. I have to think. If I don't, then Kay will be...!)
Blaise:
Did you get the answer you wanted this time? Well then, a deal's a deal...
Hold it!
Courtney:
Please wait, Mr. Chairman. I believe it is still too early to make a judgment. There are still... a few mysteries left in this case. Until we have solved them all, we cannot call this a complete victory.
Edgeworth:
......?
Courtney:
Isn't that right, Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was expecting you to shout... ..."Hold it!" ...like you always do.
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes. Of course. (Once again... Judge Courtney has come to my aid...)
Blaise:
Well then, what is it? What sort of mysteries are left?
Courtney:
Well, of course, there's the contradiction in the autopsy report.
Blaise:
...That kind of thing...
Officer:
I've brought her in!
Karin:
Wh-What's wrong? Why were we suddenly called here!? Did someone suddenly get sick!? I-I'll begin preparing a compress, stat... Ouch! "What'd you call me here for? Did something happen?"
Courtney:
Dr. Young, Ms. Jenson, you have my gratitude for taking the trouble to come here. This won't take long. So please relax.
Karin:
"Tell me what in blazes is going on!?"
Courtney:
Ha ha ha... Of course. We called you here because something came up.
Edgeworth:
(Judge Courtney... Just what are you planning?)
Courtney:
Bonnie Young! Under the Divine Rule of Law, please answer truthfully. There were no mistakes in your autopsy report, correct?
Karin:
Granny would never make a mistake!
Courtney:
That's certainly strange.
Karin:
Huh...? What's strange?
Courtney:
This court has found an error in Dr. Young's autopsy report. Dr. Young, please tell the truth. Did you falsify the autopsy report?
Karin:
That's terrible! How can you accuse her of that...!? "I have no idea what you are talking about. Why would I do such a thing in the first place?"
Courtney:
To protect the true culprit... Of course.
Karin:
"Watchu talkin' bout!? I would never do such a thing!"
Courtney:
How strange. In that case, why would there be an error in the autopsy report, I wonder. ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. What do you think?
Edgeworth:
........
Courtney:
Oh? I expected you to press into her statement like you normally do.
Edgeworth:
(Why is she taking control of the situation and trying to help me...? I don't know what her goal is... but I must play along.) If the autopsy report you gave to Sebastian had been authentic... ...then the error should not have been there.
Debeste:
W-Wait a minute! I didn't do anything!
Edgeworth:
That is what we will figure out from this point on. Firstly... Dr. Young. I'd like to hear your testimony.
Karin:
Why do you want to hear her testimony? It would be pointless!
Edgeworth:
I will be the one who decides whether or not it is pointless. Not you.
Karin:
There are patients waiting for us! ...B-But Granny... Ouch! Anyways, we don't have time for this!
Edgeworth:
Is there any way I could convince you? This is of the utmost importance.
Karin:
...Mr. Miles Edgeworth, Granny says she'll testify. So please, try to finish this quickly. If we don't return soon, there will be people in terrible suffering!
Edgeworth:
(And yet, you were lollygagging about on the viewing platform earlier...) I promise you. This won't take long. (Only if she tells me the truth, of course.)
-- Error in the Autopsy Report --
Karin:
There are no mistakes in Granny's autopsy reports!
"I've been working with corpses longer than you've been alive."
"There's no way I'd make a mistake in writing the autopsy report" ...Ouch!
"I got nothing to gain from falsifying the autopsy report."
...Is what she says. See? There's nothing strange at all!
Blaise:
Yes, yes! That's right, y'know. There's no way she would falsify it, y'see.
Courtney:
...Under the name of the Goddess of Law, do you swear that this testimony is the truth?
Karin:
Of course! Granny would never tell a lie...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
We were asking Dr. Young. We do not need to hear from a third party.
Karin:
I-I'm not a third party! I'm on Granny's side! "If you raise an objection to my testimony, you'd best prepare yourself... you ex-prosecutor!"
Edgeworth:
(I will definitely expose the contradiction in the autopsy report!)

Edgeworth:
So, you're saying there is no way Dr. Young could have made a mistake?
Karin:
Of course! Doctors can't afford to make mistakes. This is a world where just one misdiagnosis can end a long career. I know that my Granny, at least, would never... "If I did something like that, you think they'd still let me run a hospital?"
Karin:

Edgeworth:
So in your long career, you've never once made a mistake?

"A doctor's only as good as the length of their track record."
Edgeworth:
Heh. If we're just talking about a lengthy track record, that former Chief Prosecutor has one too. And yet, his actual abilities don't seem to measure up. I hope that you're not the same as well.
Blaise:
Ouch... That's a low blow, y'know. But y'know, Edgeworth. I don't make mistakes either, y'see. 'Cuase y'see, before I can make a mistake, those around me will have already made it instead. Y'see, I don't have time for mistakes. It's quite amazing, y'know. It must be karma.

"You can't compare a Chief Prosecutor with a doctor. You really can't..."
Karin:
"There's no way I'd make a mistake in writing the autopsy report" ...Ouch!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The victim wore this raincoat after suffering a blow to the head. And yet, there was not a single drop of blood on the front of the raincoat. Therefore, it is impossible for the head wound to have been "postmortem!
Karin:
Errm. Well, that's... Ouch! "I don't need you to tell me that! That's what I wrote down from the very beginning!"
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The autopsy report says, "the head wound was postmortem." That's completely different!
Karin:
Err... Y-Yeah. "I relayed to Karin what to put down in the autopsy report. After that, it was none of my beeswax!"
Edgeworth:
...Relayed to Karin? Please elaborate on that.
Change this statement to:
""I relayed everything to Karin. After that, it was none of my beeswax!""
Karin:

Courtney:
Dr. Young, do you know when that happened?
Karin:
"Before she died, of course. The wounds on her chest were postmortem. That's what I related to Karin, so that's what should've been written in the report!"
Edgeworth:

Karin:
"Even though he was about to get canned... ...he still tried to run a muck during my autopsy... I'm talking about you! You frilly red brute!"

Hmm, I see. So Mr. Edgeworth is a strange frilly red brute...
Edgeworth:
...Kay, please don't only remember odd things about me.
Kay:
Umm... It doesn't look like Granny is lying.
Edgeworth:
...Hmm. (Ms. Jenson is the one who is relying Dr. Young's words. I'll have to confirm whether or not Ms. Jenson is telling us the truth.)
Edgeworth:
Dr. Young, please confirm what this autopsy report says with your own eyes.
Karin:
Ah! I'll read it out for you... Ouch!
Young:
.....!
Karin:
"This autopsy report wasn't written by me!"
Edgeworth:
Wh... What! What do you mean!?
Karin:
...I don't know! B-But Granny! I... I can't say that!
Courtney:
Ms. Jenson. If you are trying to keep the truth in the dark, then... ...in place of the Goddess of Law, I shall hear your confession.
Edgeworth:
(...Judge Courtney is talking with Dr. Young in private.)
Courtney:
What...! Is that true? Understood. I shall convey your words to everyone else, Dr. Young. "I properly relayed the autopsy report orally to that child. It seems my granddaughter must have mucked it up when she was writing it down!"
Kay:
Wow...! She mimicked her voice perfectly.
Edgeworth:
(...There was no need for her to go that far, though.) In other words... the contents of the autopsy report had been falsified... ...by your hand, Ms. Jenson!
Karin:
......Oooh! I, I...!
Courtney:
With that, we've proven that the wound on her head came first, followed by her chest wound. Ms. Jenson, why did you falsify the autopsy report!?
Hold it!
Blaise:
Hold on a second. She never said she falsified it, y'know? She just made a teeny tiny mistake when she wrote it down. "Postmortem" and "antemortem" sound kinda similar, y'know?
Edgeworth:
They are complete opposites! That is the very definition of falsification!
Kay:
Ms. Jenson, why would you lie...?
Karin:
Kay... Ouch! "I want you to tell me too. Why you would do something like that...?" Granny...! But, I.....!
Edgeworth:
Because you falsified the autopsy report, Kay fell under suspicion. Tell me why you did it!
Karin:
I, I... can't say! I just can't say it...!
Edgeworth:
(Not "I don't want to say", but "I can't say"...?)
Blaise:
You're all a bunch of bullies, y'know. Ganging up on this poor girl who loves her grandmother so... She is totally unrelated to this. I think we can forgive her for one tiny mistake.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...That won't do. Aren't you the one with the most to lose if she testifies?
Blaise:
Hmm? What are you saying? Y'see, as a "former" prosecutor, you'll have to speak a little more clearly, y'know?
Edgeworth:
Very well. As you wish, I shall answer clearly. Ms. Jenson played an essential role in this case!
She was the true culprit
Edgeworth:
Ms. Jenson was the true culprit!
Blaise:
Ah ha ha! That's a good one. Then, how about we arrest her immediately?
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (As I thought, this wasn't it... Who did Ms. Jenson falsify the report for...? If I think about it like that, then I should understand Ms. Jenson's role in the case!)
Blaise:
Edgeworth. How about you quit joking around and clearly say what's on your mind?
Leads back to:
"Very well. As you wish, I shall answer clearly."
She was the victim
Edgeworth:
Ms. Jenson was the victim!
Blaise:
That's right, y'know. Everyone's getting on her case for such a tiny mistake. In a way, the true victim of the case is this poor girl, y'know.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (That wasn't what I meant.)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. Ms. Jenson is still alive. Wouldn't that mean that she's not a victim?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. (Who did Ms. Jenson falsify the report for...? If I think about it like that, then I should understand Ms. Jenson's role in the case!)
Blaise:
Edgeworth. How about you quit joking around and clearly say what's on your mind?
Leads back to:
"Very well. As you wish, I shall answer clearly."
She was an accomplice
Leads to:
"Ms. Jenson falsified the autopsy report in order to assist the true culprit."
Edgeworth:
Ms. Jenson falsified the autopsy report in order to assist the true culprit.
Karin:
Ah... Owwwwwchhh!
Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha! That girl is an accomplice? What's your basis for that claim?
Edgeworth:
(It was impossible for a single person to commit this crime in the first place. The crime could not have been committed without at least two people. Namely because...!)
The victim couldn't have been moved
Edgeworth:
...if there hadn't been an accomplice, the victim could not have been moved!
Kay:
The victim is a woman. Wouldn't it be possible for someone to move her on their own?
Edgeworth:
Gwaaargh! (Certainly, that's true. Recall the facts before and after the incident. If the victim also one of the participants... ...that creates a contradiction in her testimony. And we are led to only one answer!)
Blaise:
There's no basis that there had been an accomplice, y'know?
Edgeworth:
No. There is a basis.
Leads back to:
"(The crime could not have been committed without at least two people. Namely because...!)"
The number of people wouldn't match
Leads to:
"...if the Conductor was the culprit, and one of the auction guests was the victim..."
The report couldn't have been faked
Edgeworth:
...if there was no accomplice, the autopsy report could not have been falsified!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. Although that might be true... ...isn't that a little weak as the basis for there being an accomplice?
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (It seems that wasn't it... Recall the facts before and after the incident. If the victim also one of the participants... ...that creates a contradiction in her testimony. And we are led to only one answer!)
Blaise:
There's no basis that there had been an accomplice, y'know?
Edgeworth:
No. There is a basis.
Leads back to:
"(The crime could not have been committed without at least two people. Namely because...!)"
Edgeworth:
...if the Conductor was the culprit, and one of the auction guests was the victim... ...it would contradict the witness's testimony that there were eleven people after the incident.
Lotta:
What now? Ya got a problem with my testimony!?
Edgeworth:
...Not at all. Rather, it is because I believe your testimony, that's why an accomplice must exist.
Blaise:
So, you still won't admit that your reasoning is wrong?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Up until now, we had not even considered the possibility of an accomplice. However, if there had been an accomplice, it changes the entire story completely. If the accomplice took the murdered auction guest's place... ...then the number of people remains eleven!
Blaise:
Oooh... I see now. So that's what you're thinking. But, y'know, wouldn't that have been quickly discovered?
Edgeworth:
...Ms. Jenson and the victim have similar physiques. If she wore the victim's mask, she could have easily taken her place. Ms. Jenson, did you switch places with the victim?
Karin:
I, I...! ...I wouldn't...!
Edgeworth:
Who was the Conductor...? In other words, tell me who was the true culprit!
Karin:
I-I can't! I mean... That would also cause trouble for Granny...! Ah... Ouch! But, Granny...! "I will accept whatever wrongs you may have done. Just tell me everything." G... Gr...... Gr... Gra-Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyy!
Edgeworth:
As I thought... it appears you really were the accomplice.
Kay:
Ms. Jenson... Why...?
Courtney:
Ms. Jenson. ...Would you please tell us?
Karin:
Yes... It's OK, Granny. I'm fine now. I... switched places with the victim, Ms. Crane.
Edgeworth:
...So you admit to being the Conductor's accomplice?
Karin:
Yes... I helped out the Conductor. I don't really know why, but for some reason... ...the Conductor was expecting to be attacked by Ms. Crane.
Edgeworth:
(The Conductor expected an attack from the victim...?)
Karin:
They were so sure it was going to happen, that they came up with a plan to counter it. A way to beat the victim at her own game. And that's when I was called in. I was told to wait in the storeroom before the auction begin.
Hold it!
Lotta:
Whoa there! You ain't foolin' my eyes! If you were waitin' in the storeroom, I reckon I would've bumped into you! After all, I'd been up in that storeroom the entire auction!
Karin:
I'm telling the truth!
Blaise:
I wonder about that, y'know. Can we really believe a girl who would falsify a report?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Heh... There should've been many places to hide in that storeroom.
Blaise:
Then by all means, tell me. Where did our little nurse hide!?
Edgeworth:
The place in the storeroom where Ms. Jenson hid was...!
Present Costume Trunk
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"She hid inside this costume drunk."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Jenson hid here!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Do you think a person could hide in a place like that?
Edgeworth:
Heh. I don't.
Courtney:
I would like you to answer seriously.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (I knew this wasn't it...)
Kay:
Why don't we take a look at the things that were in the storeroom one more time?
Edgeworth:
Yes. There shouldn't have been that many places where one could hide in.
Blaise:
Well, Edgeworth. Where was this little nurse hiding?
Leads back to:
"The place in the storeroom where Ms. Jenson hid was...!"
Edgeworth:
She hid inside this costume drunk.
Blaise:
A costume trunk... eh?
Lotta:
Ah! Now that ya mention it, that box was already there before I snuck in! I figure I would hide in there myself, but it was wrapped up nice 'n' tight with a chain. And it was locked too, so I had to give it up.
Edgeworth:
I suspect that when you sneaked into the room, Ms. Jenson was already inside the trunk.
Karin:
Yes... it would've been bad if one of the guests from the auction had opened the bid. After instructing me to hide inside... ...the Conductor wrapped a chain around the costume trunk. I think they went downstairs using the lift shortly thereafter. It was right before the auction...
Edgeworth:
So then, when the auction began... ...only you and Ms. Hart were in the storeroom.
Karin:
Yes, that should be right...
Edgeworth:
The auction had been going on as usual, but... ...when a certain participant made the winning bid, the Conductor committed the crime. Ms. Hart must have heard the altercation that occurred then.
Lotta:
You betcha! I was tremblin' behind that there statue the whole time though!
Edgeworth:
Following the altercation, Jill Crane was murdered. After killing Jill Crane, the Conductor carried her body to the costume trunk... ...and Ms. Jenson, who had been hiding in the trunk, was made to take Ms. Crane's place. The victim's body was placed inside the costume trunk. The Conductor then took Ms. Jenson, who had been made to look like Jill Crane... ...and returned to the auction hall as if nothing had happened. Was this roughly what happened in the storeroom during the incident?
Karin:
Yes... That's right.
Lotta:
Pullin' the old switcheroo with one of the auction guests... Ain't that impossible? That gal and the murder victim are two completely different people, ya know. Don't ya reckon one of the other participants would've noticed and caused a ruckus?
Edgeworth:
No, not at all. The reason they didn't notice the switch was because...
She stole the victim's clothes
Leads to:
"From what I can tell, Ms. Jenson and the victim appear to have a similar physique."
She used the victim's name
Edgeworth:
...Ms. Jenson addressed herself by the victim's name.
Lotta:
Ain't this an auction where y'all hide yer faces with a mark? I reckon they wouldn't give out their names!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (She's completely right... Her face was hidden by a mask. What else would have been necessary to change into Ms. Crane? That's the only thing I have to consider. I should already know the answer!)
Lotta:
Hey, City Boy. Tell it to me straight. Why ain't nobody find out that they switched places?
Leads back to:
"The reason they didn't notice the switch was because..."
She acted like the victim
Edgeworth:
...most likely Ms. Jenson acted like the victim. Since her face was hidden, that's probably why no one noticed.
Lotta:
Ya dummy! Even if her face was hidden, they still wore different clothes!
Edgeworth:
Argh! (It seems that was wrong... Her face was hidden by a mask. What else would have been necessary to change into Ms. Crane? That's the only thing I have to consider. I should already know the answer!)
Lotta:
Hey, City Boy. Tell it to me straight. Why ain't nobody find out that they switched places?
Leads back to:
"The reason they didn't notice the switch was because..."
Edgeworth:
From what I can tell, Ms. Jenson and the victim appear to have a similar physique. Furthermore, there was a rule requiring a mask to be worn during the auction. If their clothes were the same, I doubt anyone would've noticed she was a different person.
Karin:
...Yes. I blended right in. I borrowed Ms. Crane's clothes and... Ouch! "You mustn't embarrass the dead like that!" I know... I also thought it was pretty heartless to leave her exposed like that... So when the Conductor wasn't looking, I covered her up in the raincoat that was up for auction.
Edgeworth:
(So she was the one who put the red raincoat on the victim...) And then, the auction resumed as if nothing had happened.
Lotta:
I reckon I took the picture of her in the red raincoat after that. That'd make all the facts line up.
Lotta:
After I took the photo, I went over to the lift to sneak a peek down below. I witnessed the 11 participants, and then I high-tailed it back behind the statue.
Edgeworth:
Don't tell me... You were hiding there the entire time until we found you?
Lotta:
Nah, that's... How should I put it...
Edgeworth:
...? What is it? Did something happen?
Lotta:
I didn't mention it before, but after that I might've dozed off a while. To be more precise... I fainted? Well, somethin' like that.
Edgeworth:
S-So something did happen!
Lotta:
I-It ain't no big deal! Kinda embarrassin' to say, though. There was this huge *THUMP* sound all of a sudden... I was a liiiittle surprised by that. It was right after I had just witnessed a murder, so I was shakin' in my foots... My hear sorta tightened up, and I was off to la-la land... When I woke up, it was already the next day, 'round the time y'all came by the storeroom.
Edgeworth:
I see. So there was a large sound... Ms. Hart, I take it you do not know what transpired in the storeroom beyond this point?
Lotta:
I-I guess. But after the auction, all the masks were properly returned... So I reckon the participants had exited through the storeroom, just like I done said!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Ms. Jenson, what were your actions after the auction resumed?
Karin:
I took the victim's place and participated in the auction. The Conductor instructed me to win the the bid for the costume trunk... ...because the body was inside it. It would have been bad if another auction guest won the bid for it...
Edgeworth:
You didn't realize the box was empty?
Karin:
No. We only found out when I came up to the storeroom to pay the bill. The Conductor was with me and told me to go search for her immediately. And then... I found another girl collapsed in front of the ladder!
Edgeworth:
Kay...
Karin:
Yes. She probably fell down from the rood and lost consciousness.
Lotta:
Maybe the victim left the hatch open when she went up to the rooftop.
Edgeworth:
I understand now. Kay was surprised at seeing the collapsed victim and did not notice the open hatch. She must have missed her footing and fell down into the storeroom. Ms. Hart, I have determined the sound that made you faint. It was likely the sound of Kay falling onto the storeroom floor.
Lotta:
That mighta been it. Though I reckon it'd be kinda pathetic to faint over something like that.
Edgeworth:
When Ms. Jenson found the unconscious Kay... ...Ms. Hart was also unconscious behind the statue. The situation is becoming clearer to me. Ms. Jenson, please continue your story.
Karin:
After I found Kay and the victim, I... put them both in the trunk. If the customers at the auction found out, there would've been a huge commotion.
Edgeworth:
Was this an order from the Conductor as well?
Karin:
Yes, it was... But, since I secretly decided to put the raincoat on Ms. Crane... ...I had to dispose of the raincoat without the Conductor noticing.
Edgeworth:
Heh... So the Conductor didn't anticipate the raincoat becoming another piece of evidence.
Karin:
And, finally... ...we dressed Ms. Crane in a spare Conductor's outfit.
Edgeworth:
I see. In doing so, you made the victim appear as if she was the Conductor.
Karin:
In the end, the auction ended without anyone noticing anything.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Ms. Jenson. Your crimes have become clear. If you know anything else, please hold nothing back.
Karin:
I want to help you more... but that is all I know... Umm, if I had to say, there is just one thing that bothers me. When I took Ms. Crane's place, I borrowed her clothes... ...but there was no way for me to borrow her hair... Ouch! "What kinda coroner's assistant goes around stealin' a corpse's hair?"
Edgeworth:
(I would think that robbing the deceased of their clothes would be questionable enough...)
Karin:
Both the color and the length of our hair is different, so I was worried about how to disguise it. However, the Conductor even had a wig prepared for me. In fact... he had two of them. Inside the costume trunk, there was both a straight wig and a wavy wig.
Edgeworth:
Two wigs...? Why were there two?
Karin:
Who knows...? Maybe it was a precaution, in case the victim had changed her hairstyle...? I ended up using the straight wig to match Ms. Crane's hair.
Edgeworth:
(So that means the wavy wig was left unused...)
Karin's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
...Is that really all you know?
Karin:
Yes... Yup, that's really all I know.
Edgeworth:
So that means you don't know who the Conductor is?
Karin:
...I'm sorry. I only knew that person as the auction conductor... I never saw that person without a mask on. The Conductor seemed to be on guard... towards everybody.
Edgeworth:
...Nngh! (At this rate...!)
Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth, is that all you've got? Even if that little nurse is an accomplice, it changes absolutely nothing, y'know? In the end, the true culprit is still Kay Faraday. All you did was add another criminal, y'know. The rule of law cannot be overturned. At least, not for your sake.
Edgeworth:
(Is this as far as I go? Am I unable... to save Kay...?)
???:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Franziska...! Why are you here!?
Franziska:
Didn't I tell you, Miles Edgeworth? Wherever there is a case, I will follow.
Courtney:
Prosecutor von Karma... Your hard work is most appreciated.
Franziska:
However... Don't get the wrong idea. I only came here to find out the truth behind what happened to Kay Faraday. ...I don't plan on forgiving you for abandoning the prosecutor's path!
Edgeworth:
...I understand.
Franziska:
.....You should thank your "former" subordinate. He gave me some valuable information which may save Kay Faraday.
Edgeworth:
! (Detective Gumshoe did...)
Franziska:
Listen well, Miles Edgeworth! This will be the final piece of evidence... Jill Crane..... suffered the wound on her head first!
Courtney:
........
Kay:
............
Franziska:
Well, someone say something!
Edgeworth:
Hm. U-Umm... Well, I hate to say it, but... ...we already proved that.
Franziska:
......Already, proved?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Well, just a few minutes ag- AARRGH!
Franziska:
You should've told me sooner!
Edgeworth:
(You're the one who barged in here and started talking!)
Franziska:
Well, then... does that mean you've found out what the murder weapon was already?
Edgeworth:
No, not yet.
Franziska:
Hmph... Is that so? In that case, listen well. The victim was struck on the head with a blunt cylindrical object. The wound on her chest was suffered postmortem.
Edgeworth:
(A cylindrical murder weapon...!)
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
Y'know, this report of yours, I trust it's accurate, of course?
Franziska:
These were the results of two independent autopsies, carried out by two respected doctors.
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
That's reassuring... but, it's too bad. You have no right to investigate this ca-
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Interpol is after the black market auctions. And I'm the prosecutor in charge of the investigation. The victim particpated in the auction. Therefore, it is only natural for me to investigate. Especially now that she's been murdered.
Blaise:
.....I see, I see. Clever girl, little Von Karma.
Courtney:
Then it has been settled. The victim died from blunt force trauma to the head.
Autopsy Report updated in my Organizer.
Examine evidence
Prongs on Candelabra
Edgeworth:
This candelabra inflicted the wounds on the victim's chest. Since we have proven that the cause of death was the wound she suffered on her head... ...this was probably used to disguise the cause of death.
Franziska:
Unfortunately... the murder weapon has yet to be found.
Edgeworth:
Heh... Just knowing the shape of the murder weapon, gives me an idea as you what it might be.
Debeste:
Hey, hey! In my investigation, we didn't find any other murder weapons, you know?
Edgeworth:
If you consider the Conductor's possessions and the crime scene, the answer should be clear. The blunt cylindrical object used in the auction hall was...
Judge Courtney's gavel
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. The murder weapon is your gavel!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I'm not sure what you're trying to say... ...but if you're suspecting me, then why don't you examine it up close and personal!
Edgeworth:
Th... That's won't be necessary. (As I thought, that was wrong. What am I doubting myself for? If I just think about the Conductor's possessions, the answer is clear.)
Debeste:
Mr. Edgeworth! Just what was the murder weapon in this case?
Leads back to:
"The blunt cylindrical object used in the auction hall was..."
An auction gavel
Leads to:
"It was something the Conductor had in their hand during the auction..."
A judge's gavel
Edgeworth:
Besides a judge's gavel, I can't think of anything else.
Blaise:
Edgeworth, there's never a dull moment with you, y'know. A judge's gavel, y'say? Sebastian, what do you think?
Debeste:
Umm... I don't think so.
Edgeworth:
Argh! (I was shot down by the Debestes! What am I doubting myself for? If I just think about the Conductor's possessions, the answer is clear.)
Debeste:
Mr. Edgeworth! Just what was the murder weapon in this case?
Leads back to:
"The blunt cylindrical object used in the auction hall was..."
Edgeworth:
It was something the Conductor had in their hand during the auction... Namely, an auction gavel.
Debeste:
An auction gavel? We didn't find anything like that!
Courtney:
If the culprit is the Conductor, it is possible that the gavel may be murder weapon. However... that alone is not reason enough, wouldn't you agree?
Edgeworth:
Of course, I have proof to back it up! This piece of evidence proves that the murder weapon is the auction gavel...
Present Lotta's Testimony
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"She hid inside this costume drunk."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Take a look at this piece of evidence. This proves the murder weapon is the auction gavel!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth. I don't know what you're trying to say... ...but if you don't want to fall prey to my whip, then stop spouting that nonsense!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (But you already hit me, regardless! Wasn't there something different after the gavel had been used as the murder weapon? I should take another look at the evidence.)
Courtney:
Well, Prosecutor Edgeworth? Can you show us evidence that the auction gavel is the murder weapon?
Edgeworth:
Heh. I can and I will.
Leads back to:
"The place in the storeroom where Ms. Jenson hid was...!"
Edgeworth:
According to Ms. Hart's testimony, after the victim had been murdered... ...it seems she suddenly stopped hearing the sound of the gavel during the auction. However, she had been able to hear it up until then. Why was that... you ask? It was because it had been used as the murder weapon and was covered in the victim's blood... ...it became necessary to dispose of it. Isn't that right? Blaise Debeste!
Blaise:
.........
Franziska:
...I'll have a search for the murder weapon performed immediately.
Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha ha! Well... Good luck with that, y'know. You've gotta work as hard as you can while you're young, y'see.
Edgeworth:
(He's completely confident that we won't find it...!)
Courtney:
Well then, while the search for the murder weapon continues... I hereby call for a brief recess.
To be continued.
April 6, 9:18 AMGrand TowerP.I.C. Meeting Room
Courtney:
Order in the court. Prosecutor von Karma. Your report, please.
Franziska:
......I have a bad news. We've searched every inch of the Grand Tower, but... ...the auction gavel was nowhere to be found.
Edgeworth:
Kh...!
Courtney:
...That is most unfortunate. It seems... I am left with no choice, but to pronounce a verdict.
Blaise:
Well... it sure seems that way, y'know. Normally, you wouldn't commit a blunder like leaving behind the murder weapon, y'know. The best criminals would never do something like that, y'see.
Edgeworth:
(Urk..... I don't have enough information! Is this as far as I can go...!?)
Blaise:
Yes, yes. It's a shame, y'know. But it can't be helped, y'see. This takes me back, y'know. All those defendants who came to me, asking for a plea bargain. They trusted me, y'know. Told me every one of their dirty little secrets, y'see. And when it came time for the trial, I'd get them sentenced to life in prison... Th-They... were all completely dumbstruck, y'know. Each and every one of them... Ha ha ha...! Oh, how I wish you all could have seen it, y'know... th-the stupid look on their faces!
Courtney:
I shall hereby announce my verdict. Please humbly accept the words of the Law.
Edgeworth:
(There's... nothing more I can do. With this, both Kay and I are...)
Kay:
........
Franziska:
If only we had some evidence...!
Courtney:
I never thought that I would be passing judgment on you like this.
Edgeworth:
(Is this the end...?)
Courtney:
The defendant... Blaise Debeste! I hereby indict you!
Franziska:
What...
Edgeworth:
WHAAAAAAAAAT!?
Blaise:
..........Oh? What's gotten into you all of a sudden?
Courtney:
I have here, documents regarding a certain case. The IS-7 Incident... A case that happened 18 years ago.
Edgeworth:
Documents... you say? Why would you suddenly...? Wait... you don't mean...! On the day of the crime, the record of your keycard being used was because...!
Courtney:
I came to this room to fetch these documents, of course. Although... when I entered the meeting room... ...it seems it was before the black market auction had begun. At first I told you that I came to gather documents about you, Prosecutor Edgeworth... At that time, I simply could not tell you the truth.
IS-7 Incident Documents jotted down in my Organizer.
Debeste:
What are you doing, Justine!? Why are you indicting Pops!? Without any basis... th-this is slander!
Courtney:
That was a wonderful remark, Sebastian!
Debeste:
...Huh? R-Really?
Courtney:
Of course there is a basis. During the case 18 years ago... ...Prosecutor Manfred von Karma "fabricated" information regarding the body.
Edgeworth:
(That was because the body of the sculptor, Isaac Dover, had been stolen...)
Franziska:
Papa "fabricated" information about a body? What do you mean...!?
Courtney:
Detective Lacer, who handled the initial investigation, reported that the body had gone missing. However, in order to deceive Prosecutor von Karma... ...there is a person who purposely did not report to him that the body had disappeared!
Franziska:
What...!
Edgeworth:
What did you say...!?
Courtney:
That person would not forgive those who defied him, nor would he allow others to hold power. He would use any means necessary, in order to bend others to his will. And then... also 18 years ago... ...Director Young, was ordered by a certain individual to write a fake autopsy report.
Edgeworth:
Dr. Young was the one who wrote the autopsy report for the IS-7 Incident!?
Hold it!
Karin:
P-Please wait! Granny didn't do anything wrong! She was ordered by that person... She had no choice but to obey!
Edgeworth:
That person...?
Courtney:
That person... was the Chief Prosecutor at the time.
Edgeworth:
The Chief Prosecutor... 18 years ago... Y-You don't mean...!
Franziska:
The Chief Prosecutor... who gave Papa his first penalty...
Courtney:
It was none other than you! Blaise Debeste!
Blaise:
............
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
Wh... What are you saying!? Pops would never do something like that!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Sebastian. We do not need your opinion right now. ...Blaise Debeste. Do you have a rebuttal?
Blaise:
Fabricating stuff about the body, Von Karma did all that on his own, y'know. Falsifying the autopsy report? Young. You would actually do something like that? Maaan... Y-You really did some terrible things behind my back, y'know...?
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Seeing as how all the parties concerned are here today, we should ask them directly.
Hold it!
Karin:
P-Please wait! Granny is... Ouch! Granny... I'm sorry! I... knew. That's why I...! Yup... Because if I didn't... He said he would expose you! If I didn't assist in the crime, Granny would be prosecuted! That's what that man... the Conductor... told me!
Blaise:
...............
Edgeworth:
So Ms. Jenson... was being threatened. Was the Conductor who threatened you... Blaise Debeste?
Karin:
Th-That... I don't know. The person who threatened me was the auction conductor. They do have similar physiques, but I never saw the person's face...
Edgeworth:
Any trivial thing is fine! Give us a characteristic that could be a clue...!
Karin:
......Th-That's right! The Conductor's mask, it exposed just a tiny part of his face. There was a tattoo there. I'm sure of it!
Conductor's Clothes data updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
A tattoo... you say?
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
I really have no idea what you're talking about, y'know. As you can see, there are clearly no tattoos on my face, y'see. So that person doesn't match me at all, y'know. The person who threatened her, this so-called Conductor... I wonder who it is, y'know. Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Courtney:
You have incurred the wrath of the Goddess of Law. I suggest you watch what you say.
Edgeworth:
(Hasn't he incurred your own wrath, rather than the wrath of the Goddess...?)
Courtney:
Jill Crane had been pursuing you, just as I have. ...And I will not let her death be in vain.
Blaise:
Crane was... y'know. You say she was pursuing me? My, my. I didn't really know her that well, y'know. I don't mind girls chasing after me, y'know. But I don't recall her ever falling for me, y'see.
Courtney:
...You didn't know the victim well? That is a testimony we haven't heard up until now. Before the eyes of the Goddess of Law, you shall give us an official testimony!
Blaise:
...I see, I see. Everyone is bullying me. I-If you're gonna go that far... That's fine, y'see... I'll just have to make you disappear.......... Every last one of you.
Courtney:
...Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall cooperate with you as well.
Edgeworth:
!
Courtney:
If we let this opportunity slip by, I doubt we will ever get him to stand in court again. Please. do not let this chance go to waste...
Edgeworth:
Yes..... I promise I will live up to your expectations.
Courtney:
Now then, Blaise Debeste, you shall testify regarding the victim!
-- Regarding Jill Crane --
Blaise:
The victim, Jill Crane, was a member of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, y'see.
Personally, I didn't really know her that well, y'know.
Either way, it's not like I had a motive to murder her, y'know.
I have no idea why she was pursuing me, y'see.
Edgeworth:
...You intend to deny your guilt until the bitter end, don't you?
Debeste:
Of course he does! There's no way Pops could be the criminal! I mean, he's my pops, you know! He's the very best, like no one ever was!
Blaise:
Yes, yes, Sebastian. If you're gonna stick up for me, be sure to have a clear basis, y'know.
Debeste:
A-Alright... I got it! I'll clear you of these false accusations, Pops. I believe in you, Pops! We won't lose to someone like Mr. Edgeworth!
Blaise:
Yes, yes. ...You really are pure, y'know?
Kay:
That person... he really loves his father, doesn't he...?
Franziska:
However... one must be able to accept the mistakes of their father... ...no matter how much they may look up to him...
Courtney:
...Each person must atone for their crimes, no matter who they are.
Edgeworth:
..... (This is going to be hard for Sebastian, but... ...I simply cannot overlook his father's crimes!)
Rebuttal
-- Regarding Jill Crane --
Blaise:
The victim, Jill Crane, was a member of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, y'see.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
If she was a member of the P.I.C, then you should have been familiar with her.
Blaise:
Well... I knew her face, but that's about it, y'know. It's not like we met each other on a regular basis, y'see...
Blaise:
Personally, I didn't really know her that well, y'know.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you're saying you weren't very familiar with the victim?
Blaise:
That's right. I didn't even know about the burn mark on Crane's hand, y'see.
Edgeworth:
You didn't know about the burn mark...?
Blaise:
W-Well, y'see... Even if I had gotten close to her, she would have disappeared soon... It's a pain to remember someone, y'know, wh-when they're must gonna disappear, y'see.
Edgeworth:
(In other words, anyone who defies him disappears...) I would like you to add your statement about the victim's burn to your testimony.
Add statement:
"I only just learned that she had a burn mark on her hand, y'see."
Blaise:
I only just learned that she had a burn mark on her hand, y'see.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you're saying that you didn't know about the victim's burn... Is that really the truth?
Blaise:
You really are persistent, y'know. Do you really think I would pay attention to every little wound on a woman's hand?
Edgeworth:
I would think the burn mark on the victim's hand would be hard to miss...
Courtney:
Now that you mention it... Jill Crane would regularly wear gloves. I, too, did not know about the burn until the incident occurred.
Edgeworth:
(Jill Crane regularly wore gloves...?)
Blaise:
I thought so. She was probably trying to hide the burn mark, y'see? I understand how sensitive a woman can be about these things, y'know.
Edgeworth:
...I would like you to add your so-called sensitive understanding of a woman to your testimony.
Add statement:
"Maybe she was always wearing gloves in order to hide the burn mark, y'know."
Blaise:
Maybe she was always wearing gloves in order to hide the burn mark, y'know.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you were aware that she always wore gloves?
Blaise:
Well aware. Those gloves were practically her trademark, y'see. But I guess they weren't just a fashion statement. She wanted to hide her burn mark, y'know. I wonder if that girl over there is also hiding something under her bandages?
Kay:
Huh...? I'm... not hiding anything...
Blaise:
I think you are, y'know. You're hiding the face of a criminal!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Those words... should be directed at someone like you. I shall expose, here and now... the face of a true criminal!
Blaise:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! How amusing. ...Go ahead and try it, if you think you can.
Edgeworth:
(So, Jill Crane regularly wore gloves... That's interesting... I should look over the evidence one more time.)
Present Stuffed Animal
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Jill Crane regularly wore gloves..."
Blaise:
Either way, it's not like I had a motive to murder her, y'know.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Was there ever any trouble between you two over work?
Blaise:
Ah ha ha! Unlikely, y'know. I'm kind of important, y'see. I've gotten reports saying that she was exceedingly capable. But, y'know, our social status was completely different, y'see? So we didn't talk much, y'know.
Edgeworth:
That may be true, but it doesn't prove that you didn't kill her.
Blaise:
That's rather prejudiced, y'know. I mean, look at you. You're taking the side of a criminal.
Courtney:
It seems Ms. Crane was the one who had an interest in you, Mr. Chairman.
Blaise:
Y'know, that really is a mystery. I haven't the faintest idea, y'see. So that's that. Since I had no motive, your reasoning doesn't hold, y'know?
Blaise:
I have no idea why she was pursuing me, y'see.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you have no clue why the victim had been pursuing you?
Blaise:
Nope. Not in the slightest, y'know...
Debeste:
It's because Pops is such a handsome man!
Blaise:
It's true, y'know. Women appear before me and then disappear, disappear and then reappear...
Debeste:
Heh heh. You guys could never reach my Pop's level of awesomeness.
Courtney:
It would certainly be impossible for a normal person... ...having people appear and then "physically" disappear on a daily basis.
Blaise:
......Well, then. Maybe Courtney's going to disappear too?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Before that happens, I'll see to it your way of life disappears today.
Blaise:
I see, I see... Then I should finish it before the day's over. Keh heh heh heh heh.
Edgeworth:
(I will have to organize my information about the victim...)
Franziska:
...If there's anything you don't understand, you should look over the evidence again. Perhaps you'll find a new fact this time around.
Edgeworth:
! Franziska... You're willing to help me?
Franziska:
I told you, I'm doing this for Kay Faraday... not you.
Edgeworth:
(...Franziska seems to be worrying about Kay in her own way.)
Edgeworth:
Jill Crane regularly wore gloves... If that is true, then it creates a huge contradiction.
Blaise:
Oh? A huge contradiction, y'say...?
Edgeworth:
I would like you to listen to the voices recorded on this stuffed animal one more time.
...*bzz*...*bzzz*... *bzzz*...*bzt*... And... th...
I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me.
........
Silence, huh... I've been waiting for my chance to get revenge all this time!
AAAAAAHHH... *bzz* ...*bzzz*...*bzt*...
Edgeworth:
We were under the impression that this was the moment when the victim was murdered. "I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me." ...We thought that this statement was said by the culprit.
Blaise:
I-Isn't that fine? What's the problem, y'know?
Edgeworth:
Heh... There is a huge problem with that. If the victim had been wearing gloves from the start... ...it would have been impossible to see the burn on her hand!
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
Gloves come off very easily, y'know? She could have taken them off during the auction.
Edgeworth:
! That's...!
Hold it!
Karin:
That's not true! Ms. Crane had been wearing her gloves when I took her place! She must have been wearing them before she was murdered!
Blaise:
Wh... What are you saying? You! Don't you understand the position you're in!?
Karin:
I-I... I'm not scared anymore! I have Granny here with me! "Blaise... Your day of reckoning has finally come."
Blaise:
...Somehow... it seems like you all want to disappear... permanently!
Edgeworth:
The only one who will be disappearing here... is you! Blaise Debeste!
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
Hey! How dare you say that to Pops! Does it really matter if the burn mark was visible or not?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...It certainly does matter. If the burn mark was visible, then we'd have a complete turnabout of the situation!
Debeste:
Wha... What are you saying!? If the victim's burn mark wasn't visible, what exactly does that tell you?
The culprit also had a burn mark
Leads to:
"Sebastian. ...Turn your way of thinking around."
The victim didn't have a burn mark
Edgeworth:
The victim didn't have a burn mark at all!
Debeste:
Mr. Edgeworth. You should probably take another look at the victim's hand. No matter how you look at it, the victim definitely has a burn mark!
Edgeworth:
Urgh! (He went straight to the point. If we assume that the culprit could not see the victim's burn mark... ...then what did the person who spoke in the recording see...? I should have the answer!)
Debeste:
Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Give me a serious answer!
Leads back to:
"If the victim's burn mark wasn't visible, what exactly does that tell you?"
There weren't any burn marks
Edgeworth:
There weren't any burn marks at all... They were all a fantasy from the very beginning!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. What do you see on Ms. Crane's hand?
Edgeworth:
...Mmph. (There's clearly a burn mark... If we assume that the culprit could not see the victim's burn mark... ...then what did the person who spoke in the recording see...? I should have the answer!)
Debeste:
Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Give me a serious answer!
Leads back to:
"If the victim's burn mark wasn't visible, what exactly does that tell you?"
Edgeworth:
Sebastian. ...Turn your way of thinking around. If the victim was wearing gloves, then her burn mark could not have been seen. In that case, whose burn mark was seen?
Debeste:
Someone else's... burn mark...?
Edgeworth:
Precisely. The culprit must have had a burn mark as well. In other words... "I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me." The person who said this... was not the culprit, but the victim!
Debeste:
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaat!?
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
...Sebastian. Could you please step aside? Edgeworth. All your reasoning up til now was just a figment of your imagination, y'know? The culprit had a burn mark? ...Where was it, y'know? If you can't answer that, then your logic doesn't hold up, y'know?
Edgeworth:
(...Where was the culprit's burn mark...?)
Kay:
...I wonder where the burn mark could have been...? During the auction... wasn't everyone wearing a disguise?
Edgeworth:
...Indeed. During the auction, everyone should have been dressed in a particular way. (If the burn mark was still visible under those conditions, then...)
Blaise:
Now, now. Why don't you show us? Where was the culprit's burn? ...You'll have to show me the proof, y'see!
Present Conductor's Clothes
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"She hid inside this costume drunk."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
Blaise:
Are you suggesting it will tell me where the burn mark was located? It's too bad, but I just don't understand it at all, y'know.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (So I was wrong...! I need to consider the state of the Conductor when Ms. Crane saw the burn mark... If I focus on that, the location of the burn mark should logically come to light.)
Blaise:
Hey, Edgeworth. Hurry up and present it, y'know.
Leads back to:
"Where was the culprit's burn? ...You'll have to show me the proof, y'see!"
Edgeworth:
It was what the Conductor was wearing the auction... In other words, the outfit you were wearing at the time!
Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha! What can you figure out from the clothes alone?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The Conductor had been wearing a white suit, white gloves, and a mask... His attire had covered up most of his skin. However, according to Ms. Jenson's testimony... ...the Conductor's mask exposed a small part of his face. In addition, while she thought there had been a tattoo there... ...it's possible that she simply mistook the burn mark for a tattoo!
Debeste:
! A burn mark... on his face...?
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
That's all very scintillating, but I'm afraid you're getting excited over nothing, y'know. None of the P.I.C. members have any burn marks on their faces, y'see. Naturally, that includes me as well, y'know!
Debeste:
Huh...? P-Pops...? But.....!
Blaise:
...Sebastian. Could you please be quiet? If you're an idiot, then act like one, y'know?
Debeste:
......
Edgeworth:
(Normally, Sebastian is a nuisance to everyone around him... ...but this time, I owe him my gratitude. That reaction from Blaise's own son... It reveals the truth more clearly than anything else. Thanks to him, I am confident that my reasoning is correct! I know who that unidentified piece of evidence belongs to!)
Kay:
I wonder what's wrong with that prosecutor...?
Edgeworth:
Usually, Sebastian is slower to arrive at the truth than anyone else. However, this time he has probably figured it out. His own father... is a criminal.
Kay:
Since he knows the truth... He's... in pain, isn't he? ...If he didn't know the truth, he could have remained blissful in his ignorance...
Edgeworth:
...Kay. We are here in order to pursue the truth. It doesn't matter what path my reasoning takes, the important thing is to arrive at the truth. Once before... when I lost faith in my reasoning, you said that to me and showed me the way. This time, I shall show you the truth. You are innocent!
Kay:
...I..... ...I also... want to know the truth. Mr. Edgeworth... Please tell me!
Edgeworth:
Yes... That's the spirit.
Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's impossible, y'know. For all of you. I mean, just where could I possibly have a burn mark? It's nowhere to be found, y'see! There's no evidence to prove that I'm the culprit, y'know.
Debeste:
Th-That's right! There's no contradiction at all! There's no way there can be a contradiction! Not for my Pops...!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...Sebastian. I understand why you don't want to admit it. However... if you avert your eyes from the truth, you will regret it forever.
Debeste:
! P-Pops... I... Just what should I do...!?
Blaise:
......Hah. I really wonder... Why you're such an idiot, y'know? Sebastian. If you really wanna save me, you'll have to try a little bit harder, y'see... Gotta use your head, y'know? ...Honestly, you really are a useless idiot.
Debeste:
N-No way...! But, I tried real hard... I tried my best, Pops! I went to the school you told me to go, reached the top of my class, just like you told me to! Just look at this jacket! Only someone who graduates at the top of his class gets to wear it! I did everything you told me to do! That's how I got to be the best at the academy! I even won all those awards, just so I could be like you, Pops...!
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
You really are... such an idiot, y'know.
Debeste:
...!
Blaise:
Y'know those gold stars you got on your tests, I made the teachers give them to you. Every speech and debate contest, all of the judges were my friends. Y'know, Sebastian. If you weren't even able to notice something like that... ...you're really not worthy of being called my son. Don't you think?
Debeste:
Ah... ah... ah... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! WAAAAaaaaaaaahhh!
Blaise:
Awww... Even my son has disappeared... Ah ha ha ha ha ha... Oh my... It's enough to make me cry, y'know. H-He was trying his best for me, and yet, he was totally useless, y'know...
Edgeworth:
You are truly a despicable person. As the Chairman of the P.I.C., and as a father...!
Franziska:
...Even I feel sorry for that foolish prosecutor.
Kay:
...Poor Mr. Prosecutor...
Courtney:
Blaise Debeste! You... Just what do you think of your own son!?
Blaise:
He's just a useless pawn, y'see. Whoa now. Maybe you should look in the mirror before you criticize me, y'know. I mean, even you... you also used Sebastian to get close to me, didn't you?
Courtney:
...I cannot deny that. However... he is not a mere "pawn"! He always tried to do his very best, even if the results aren't up to par. I've seen just how hard he tries. ...And yet, you refuse to even acknowledge it...!
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha ha! That kid is no good, y'see. No matter what he does... or is told to do!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste!
Edgeworth:
Yes. That was my intention... from the beginning. (If there was a burn mark on the Conductor's face... ...then Blaise Debeste must be hiding it. What was he wearing during the auction? That is... key to revealing the truth!)
Courtney:
Well then, allow me to hear your answer! Please show the piece of evidence that proves the culprit had a burn mark on his face!
Present Karin's Testimony
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"If you would recall Ms. Jenson's testimony. There's still one point that remains unexplained."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
Blaise:
Are you saying that shows the proof of the burn mark? I don't understand, y'know. I don't understand it at all.
Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste! Even if you do not understand...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I also do not understand.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (So this isn't the proof... There is one clear difference between the Conductor and Blaise... He should be hiding the burn mark there... Now all I need to do is present the evidence that shows it!)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste!
Edgeworth:
Yes. That was my intention... from the beginning.
Leads back to:
"Well then, allow me to hear your answer!"
Edgeworth:
If you would recall Ms. Jenson's testimony. There's still one point that remains unexplained. Two types of wigs had been prepared, one of which was left unused.
Courtney:
Do you mean the wavy wig...?
Franziska:
...What are you talking about?
Edgeworth:
It was something Ms. Jenson found when she switched places with the victim.
Franziska:
What does something like that have to do with the burn!?
Edgeworth:
Inside the costume trunk, Ms. Jenson witnessed two wigs. One of them had been used by Ms. Jenson to make her look like the victim. Now then, just what was the other wig used for?
Franziska:
...It doesn't seems like it was a spare wig.
Edgeworth:
There's no need to overthink it. Just compare the attire of the true culprit, the Conductor, with that of Blaise Debeste.
Blaise:
......! D-Don't stare at me like that.
Edgeworth:
Don't you think there's just one spot where there is a huge contradiction? Specifically, around his face.
Franziska:
! So that's...!
Kay:
...Not a wig at all.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. ...It was no wig. Blaise Debeste! It was your fake beard!
Blaise:
A... Ah ha ha... This is... a real beard, y'know. Don't tease me like that, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...Your son must have realized the truth before anyone else. That's why he was trying so desperately to protect you. You were also worried that he would tell the truth... Isn't that why you drove your son away from here? Because... he knew that his father was hiding a burn under his fake beard!
Blaise:
G... Grr...!
Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste! How about you remove that fake beard of yours!
Blaise:
Y... YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHITBURNSITBURNSTHEGOGGLESDONOTHING!
Edgeworth:
!
Kay:
Ah... A burn mark...!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Justice has been served before the Goddess of Law... For that, I give you my thanks.
Edgeworth:
...I should be the one thanking you.
Courtney:
Blaise Debeste! I hereby announce my verdict! You shall be taken into custody for the murder of Jill Crane!
April 6, 9:44 AMGrand TowerP.I.C. Meeting Room
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... Thank you very much. I am so happy that you believed in me to the very end!
Edgeworth:
...There's no need to thank me. As a prosecutor... No, as a friend, I simply wanted to save you.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I bring good tidings. It seems that former Chairman Debeste has been safely detained in the detention center. However, the search for the murder weapon, the auction gavel, continues... Blaise Debeste is a shrewd man. There is a good chance that he has already disposed of it. There is also... one piece of testimony that concerns me. Blaise Debeste mentioned that the only thing he did not fake were the letters.
Edgeworth:
...What do you mean?
Courtney:
First, he found this letter in Jill Crane's clothes... Then, he also found this letter on Kay, who was unconscious in the storeroom. The contests of the letters seem to suggest that the two had been corresponding with each other... Which is why Blaise Debeste assumed that the two were working together.
Edgeworth:
(Ridiculous. That can't be right.)
Courtney:
After reading the two letters, he decided to pin the crime on Kay Faraday. In order to cast suspicion on her, he planted one of the letters in a noticeable spot... ...the deceased Jill Crane's left breast pocket.
Edgeworth:
Isn't that just an excuse?
Courtney:
Yes. That is what I thought as well. It may have simply been a last-ditch effort to save himself. However, before the stern eyes of the Goddess of Law, these are all trivial matters. His crime shall certainly not go unpunished. With this, I have finally fulfilled one of my long-standing missions.
Edgeworth:
...Judge Courtney. Will you tell me what you know? Why did Blaise Debeste murder Jill Crane? And what lies hidden behind this case?
Courtney:
Yes. I don't mind. You have the right to know everything. Long ago, Jill Crane was in love with a cameraman. That man was pursuing the black market auction as a journalist. And then... before he could reach the truth, he was erased.
Edgeworth:
......
Courtney:
The feelings and the items Ms. Crane inherited from her beloved... ...brought her to the auction. She had come to exact revenge on the Conductor... Blaise. ...Although in the end, she was the one who was murdered instead...
Edgeworth:
I see... So that's what happened.
Courtney:
While the Goddess of Law cannot condone her actions... ...we have succeeded in her goal of bringing Blaise Debeste's crimes to light.
Edgeworth:
(So, Judge Courtney's goal was to expose Blaise Debeste... ...and reveal the dark secrets of the P.I.C.)
Kay:
Umm... By the way, what happened to the young prosecutor...?
Courtney:
...We have been unable to contact him for some time now.
Kay:
Do you have any idea where he might be...?
Courtney:
I... had not been truly working for him, so...
Kay:
I see... I feel very sorry for him.
Franziska:
...What you should be sorry for, is the fact that he was kept in the dark until now. No matter how cruel reality is, he will have to accept it. If he can't... he won't be able to walk his own path in life. ...Ever.
Edgeworth:
...A father's influence is not something that is easily erased. However, I'm sure he will be able to change from here on out.
Kay:
Yes... That's right. Surely... You must be right. Will I too... be able to walk my own path in life...?
Karin:
Kay! Is your body alright!?
Kay:
Y-Yes. Thanks to you...
Karin:
I'm so sorry! Even though you're my patient... ...you ended up getting suspected because of me... Ouch! "You can't just take care of the patient's body. You gotta take care of the heart too." That's my Granny! Kay, how are your memories?
Kay:
I feel like... I'm on the verge of remembering something...
Courtney:
...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Patricia Roland's trial.
Edgeworth:
That would be the trial for the murder of Horace Knightley... Who's in charge of the defense?
Courtney:
Ms. Crane was supposed to be her defense attorney, but now that she has passed away... ...we are currently arranging for a replacement defense attorney.
Edgeworth:
(Jill Crane had been in charge of Patricia Roland's defense!?)
Courtney:
I'll also have to get in contact with Sebastian quickly, since he's the prosecutor in charge... Well then...
Kay:
Ah...! P-Please wait! What about Mr. Edgeworth's prosecutor's badge? What will happen... to his prosecutor's badge?
Courtney:
With the chairman's arrest, the P.I.C. is no longer functional... ...so I cannot answer that question easily. Perhaps one should say... Only the Goddess of Law knows?
Kay:
B-But that's...!
Edgeworth:
...You don't need to worry about me. This is the path that I have chosen.
Courtney:
It seems you have no plans to change it either.
Edgeworth:
Of course not. I chose this path to seek the truth.
Courtney:
...With the departure of Blaise Debeste, the Law has once again returned to our hands. If you truly desire to continue the prosecutor's path... ...I am willing to assist you in reclaiming your badge.
Edgeworth:
I appreciate the sentiment... but I must decline. I did not relinquish my badge with half-hearted feelings.
Courtney:
I see... It seems that our paths of Law will continues to run counter to each other.
Edgeworth:
...Heh. Until our paths cross once again, I shall have you hold onto that badge.
Courtney:
That was my intention from the start.
Franziska:
.....
Courtney:
...However, on occasion, the Goddess of Law is quite generous. Please return this notebook to its proper owner.
Edgeworth:
Kay's "Promise Notebook"!
Courtney:
It seems this was scheduled to be put up for bidding at the black market auction. The name "Kay" is written on the notebook. It seems Blaise Debeste quickly realized this belonged to the girl. Since the letters he found also contained the same name...
Edgeworth:
You speak as if he really did not know about the letters. Are you saying that Blaise really did not prepare the letters himself?
Courtney:
Yes. That man said so himself... Kay Faraday's goal was to steal back the notebook. Jill Crane's goal was to get revenge. In order to achieve their goals, the two teamed up to infiltrate the auction... or so he says. 
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately... this was all Blaise's misunderstanding. It was purely a coincidence. If the attorney from the P.I.C. and Kay really were acquaintances... ...it would be strange that she never mentioned it to me, considering her personality.
Courtney:
Ha ha. You really do trust her, don't you?
Edgeworth:
.......
Courtney:
In the end, the notebook was used as another red herring, but... It's something that is very important to that girl, isn't it? I'll make a special exception and return it. I'm sure that's what the Goddess of Law desires.
Edgeworth:
That's... Um.... I appreciate it.
Courtney:
I shall pray that she recovers her lost memories.
Kay:
Umm... Is something wrong...?
Edgeworth:
...Kay. I am returning something very important to you.
Kay:
Ah... This is...!
Kay:
Always greet people with a smile, even people you don't know. Never cry in front of strangers. Look, Daddy! I wrote them all down! Yup! I'll be sure to follow all of our promises, and become a hero just like you, Daddy! ...Ah! That's right! There was one more... I forgot to write down the most important promise! Promise number five... Always try your hardest to learn about things you don't understand! Eheheh... I'll be sure to remember. I'll never, ever forget them!
Kay:
...Always try your hardest... to learn about things you don't understand... That's right... I'm... "I" am...! I am...! ...the "Great Thief" who steals the truth, Kay Faraday! I'm the Second Yatagarasu, and Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!
Edgeworth:
Kay... You remember!?
Kay:
Eheheh... It's kinda embarrassing, though. Thank you so much! It's all thanks to you, Mr. Edgeworth! Even when I lost my memories, you were still always trying to save me, right?
Edgeworth:
Heh... It seems you're back to normal.
Karin:
Wow! Kay! You've gotten better! Your health comes first! Now you can relax! "Just make sure you don't run off and lose all your memories again."
Kay:
Ah... Ms. Jenson, Dr. Young! Thanks for worrying about me.
Karin:
"Hey. If you're feeling all better, how about changing back into your own clothes?" I washed your clothes for you, Kay, so they're nice and clean!
Edgeworth:
These clothes... Wasn't Detective Gumshoe holding on to them?
Karin:
He said forensics was done with them, so he gave them back to me.
Edgeworth:
...Have they revealed the results of the analysis yet?
Karin:
Hmm... To be honest, I actually didn't think to ask about that... Now, now! More importantly, let's hurry up and get you changed, Kay!
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Still... Isn't it better if we do not remove her bandages?
Karin:
Ah. She should be fine now. Kay just bumped her head. She didn't really have any other major injuries.
Edgeworth:
Then... Why was she so heavily bandaged?
Karin:
Better safe than sorry! A pound of prevention is worth an ounce of cure! That's my motto!
Edgeworth:
(What a troublesome motto...)
Karin:
Come on, Kay! Let's get you dressed up over there!
Kay:
Now, this is definitely what a Great Thief should look like!
Franziska:
...A smile certainly suits you best. In the past... and now as well.
Kay:
Ms. von Karma... Thank you for coming too!
Franziska:
I-I... I only came because Scruffy asked me to. That Scruffy, he also wanted to see your energetic self again.
Kay:
Gummy...! What happened to Gummy!?
Franziska:
Who knows... Maybe he was disgusted with the man who willingly threw away his prosecutor's badge?
Edgeworth:
! (Detective Gumshoe...)
Franziska:
...I must be going soon. I'll be taking these ladies in for questioning.
Kay:
Ah... What's going to happen to the two of them?
Franziska:
One aided in the murder of an attorney, the other forged an autopsy report 18 years ago... Those crimes definitely won't disappear. Of course... I will mention in court that they were being blackmailed by Blaise.
Karin:
We'll be just fine! As long as Granny's by my side, we're invincible!
Franziska:
...Well then, take care.
Edgeworth:
Now then... Kay. Sorry to ask so soon right after you regained your memories, but I have some questions.
Kay:
Sure! Ask me anything you want!
Edgeworth:
What were you doing on the day you lost your memories?
Kay:
On that day... I was asked to come to Gourd Lake. I don't know who called me there, though. As I was watching the moon at Gourd Lake... ...a person in a red raincoat approached me! All of a sudden, he used some kind of drug to knock me out!
Edgeworth:
What...! (What is she saying? The place where Kay saw the moon was at Gourd Lake?)
Kay:
When I woke up, it seems I somehow ended up on the roof of the Grand Tower. My mind was still in a daze, so I stumbled around for a bit... That's when I found the person in the red raincoat, collapsed! I was startled. And when I stepped back in panic... ...I fell from a high place and got knocked out cold again! And, when I woke up, all my memories were gone. The person in the red raincoat... Who exactly was that person? Oh yeah... I was certain that I saw them walking in mid-air... Hmm... Somehow, this is all starting to make my head hurt!
Edgeworth:
...Please calm down. You're just a little confused because you've only recently gotten your memory back. Most likely, this is the main cause of your confused memories...
You fell in a hole
Edgeworth:
Isn't it because you fell in a hole?
Kay:
It's true, that's what caused me to lose my memories, but... ...that's not really the direct cause behind my confused memories, right?
Edgeworth:
Hm... Yes. (Indeed, that's not it...) Right before you were at the Grand Tower, you were at the Gourd Lake Park. In that case, there can only be one reason why your memories are confused.
Kay:
Huh? What is it then!?
Leads back to:
"Most likely, this is the main cause of your confused memories..."
Your memories of two places
Leads to:
"This is probably the main cause of your confused memories..."
Your name on the notebook
Edgeworth:
Your name written on the Promise Notebook must be the cause.
Kay:
Hmm. Why does my name being written in the Promise Notebook... ...caused me to remember the person in the red raincoat floating in mid-air?
Edgeworth:
Uh... Hmm. (As one would expect, they aren't related.) Right before you were at the Grand Tower, you were at the Gourd Lake Park. In that case, there can only be one reason why your memories are confused.
Kay:
Huh? What is it then!?
Leads back to:
"Most likely, this is the main cause of your confused memories..."
Edgeworth:
This is probably the main cause of your confused memories... You saw the moon at both the Gourd Lake Park and the Grand Tower rooftop... ..which led you to confuse the two places.
Kay:
Huh? But... aren't they totally different places? Even if I was in a daze, do you really think I'd get them confused?
Edgeworth:
Most likely, there was something at the Grand Tower which led to your confusion.
Present cherry tree or food stall
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The Grand Tower rooftop and Gourd Lake have two points in common."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Wasn't this at the Grand Tower?
Kay:
Huh? That's... I'm not totally sure!
Edgeworth:
...Hmph. (It seems this wasn't it.)
Kay:
Ah! Now that you mention it, the Grand Tower rooftop... ...does kind of look similar to the Gourd Lake Park!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. That must be what caused your memories to become confused.
Kay:
So then, what specifically was the cause?
Leads back to:
"Most likely, there was something at the Grand Tower which led to your confusion."
Edgeworth:
The Grand Tower rooftop and Gourd Lake have two points in common. They both have a cherry tree and a food stall.
Kay:
Ah! Now that you mention it...!
Edgeworth:
Your memories were confused because you had been in two similar locations. The person that you first saw could not have been walking in mid-air. They were simply walking on the ground at Gourd Lake Park. You must have gotten that scene confused with the Grand Tower rooftop.
Kay:
S-So that's what happened... How dare they steal the memories of a Great Thief! They'll pay for this!
Edgeworth:
(Nevertheless... I wonder who the person that assaulted Kay was? The person in the red raincoat, who appeared at Gourd Lake...)
...*beep beep beep*...
Edgeworth:
Hm. What's that noise?
Kay:
It sounds like it's coming from the storeroom! Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go check it out!
Lotta:
Wh-What's this!? My shutterbug sense is tinglin'! I smell me another scoop!
Edgeworth:
(! Y-You're still here...!?)
April 6, 9:53 AMGrand Tower51st Floor Storeroom
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! This walkie-talkie thing here is what's beeping!
Edgeworth:
Hmm...! (This transceiver... Why do I feel like I've seen it somewhere before...?)
...*beep beep beep*...
Kay:
I-It's still beeping, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(I'm not particularly familiar with this sort of evidence...)
Kay:
C'mon, we have to answer it! Here goes!
...*click*...
Kay:
Hello! Edgeworth speaking!
Edgeworth:
K-Kay. Please don't just answer it on your own.
???:
I am speaking with Mr. Miles Edgeworth, I presume?
Edgeworth:
(Th-This voice is...!) ...Shelly de Killer!
de Killer:
I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Are you aware of the mastermind who is pulling the strings behind this incident?
Edgeworth:
You...! Why do you know about the incident!?
de Killer:
...That's not important right now, wouldn't you agree? Right now, we're discussing the mastermind behind this case.
Edgeworth:
...I've had an inkling that such a person existed, even before you said anything. After all, there was evidence to suggest that someone had used Kay to disrupt the investigation.
Kay:
Huh!? There was...? So... who's this mastermind?
de Killer:
I would like to hear your thoughts on the matter. Would you kindly show me the evidence that indicates the existence of a mastermind?
Present Victim's Letter
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The Grand Tower rooftop and Gourd Lake have two points in common."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This indicates the existence of a mastermind in this case.
Kay:
Hmm, I can't say I really understand.
de Killer:
I am very sorry, but I also do not understand.
Edgeworth:
Nngh... (So this wasn't it? Wasn't there anything that was left unexplained among the evidence?)
de Killer:
I await your answer, Mr. Edgeworth.
Leads back to:
"Would you kindly show me the evidence that indicates the existence of a mastermind?"
Edgeworth:
It was the letter that Kay allegedly sent to the victim.
Kay:
C-Come to think of it...! I don't remember writing that letter at all!
de Killer:
...Who could have prepared this letter...? I, too, am quite curious to know.
Edgeworth:
So, you're not the one who wrote the letter?
de Killer:
What could I possibly gain from doing such an act? ...Is it not necessary for you to stand in court in order to make the truth clear? What can you possibly do, now that your badge has been taken from you...? I look forward to finding out from the shadows.
Edgeworth:
(This man... How does he know that!?)
de Killer:
Do we have an understanding? Please ensure you do not betray my trust. Now then, if you'll excuse me.
...*click*...
Kay:
He said the case wasn't solved yet. What did he mean by that? And why would Mr. de Killer even bother telling us that? Ugh... Nothing makes sense anymore!
Edgeworth:
(This case... has not reached its true conclusion yet. However... although I've lost my prosecutor's badge, who I am still has not changed. While I don't know where this may lead me, I shall reveal the truth... I swear it!)
THE END
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right... I need to reconsider the information.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information. I need to think this over one more time.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Franziska von Karma)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There is a clear contradiction in your testimony.
Franziska:
In that case, would you care to explain what the contradiction is? Depending on your answer, you may or may not incur the wrath of my whip.
Edgeworth:
Gwaaah! (I didn't even say anything yet!)
Ema:
As long as she has her whip, words alone won't reach her! You'll need to present evidence!
Edgeworth:
Right. I won't let her whip me again.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Franziska von Karma)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Doesn't your testimony contradict with this piece of evidence?
Franziska:
You would do well to think things over yourself before questioning others. And for the record, my answer is "nein"!
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (I guess that was wrong...)
Ray:
What are you doing, Miles? You're turning Franny-pie into fifty shades of rage! Before that whip hits you, you should hurry up and... YOOOWZAAA!
Franziska:
Foolish words will only result in fifty shades of pain!
Edgeworth:
(I should settle this before Mr. Shields ends up as fifty shades of maimed...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Franziska von Karma)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Franziska, will you take a look at this piece of evidence?
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth. I'm warning you, if you do not wish to become my whip's next victim... Do not present such meaningless things before me!
Edgeworth:
Ngh! (What was the point of warning me!?)
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth, scientifically speaking, that whip looks extremely painful!
Edgeworth:
I don't need science to tell me how painful it is...
Ema:
Maybe you should be a bit more careful next time.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Justine Courtney)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
Courtney:
I'm afraid I cannot accept that piece of evidence. I do not believe it has any relation to my testimony.
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (As I expected, she's nothing like Mr. Debeste. However, I won't back down so easily!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Justine Courtney)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Don't you have a problem with that statement just now?
Courtney:
Should I have a problem with it?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Exactly. Because there's no problem at all!
Courtney:
In that case, you should have refrained from speaking in the first place.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhooh! (I don't think that left a good impression...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Justine Courtney)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. There is a contradiction in your testimony!
Courtney:
I cannot authorize this statement.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... And why not?
Courtney:
Because it's obvious you're bluffing.
Edgeworth:
Nguuuoooh! (Is that the impression I give off? ...Next time for sure, I will present evidence that will silence her for good!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Blaise Debeste)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Doesn't this piece of evidence create a contradiction in your testimony?
Blaise:
Hrmmm... I wonder. What do you think, Sebastian?
Debeste:
I don't really understand, but I don't think so.
Blaise:
I know, right? That's what I was thinking as well.
Edgeworth:
Ugh! (What's with this father and son tag team...!)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, it's fine. Why don't we just give up...?
Edgeworth:
Kay. It's still much too early to give up. I will definitely prove your innocence.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Blaise Debeste)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste! Take a look at this piece of evidence.
Blaise:
What's wrong, Edgeworth? You're getting all fired up. Maybe you should cool your head and think it over once again. 'Cause I don't have time to put up with something as meaningless as that.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (So that was wrong!)
Debeste:
Mr. Edgeworth. You really think someone like you can defeat my pops!? Pops is super important, you know!
Blaise:
Yes, yes. You're embarrassing me, Sebastian, so please stop, OK?
Edgeworth:
(Blaise Debeste... He seems to be a fairly formidable opponent. I should make my moves more carefully.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Blaise Debeste)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste. Take a look at this piece of evidence and tell me what you think!
Blaise:
What do I think? Absolutely nothing at all... Right, Sebastian?
Debeste:
Yeah, Pops. That has nothing to do with your testimony just now!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (Even Sebastian...!)
Kay:
It looks like Mr. Debeste has gotten a bit livelier, hasn't he?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. He probably feels a lot more confident with his father backing him up. However, I will break through that confidence of the Debeste father and son duo.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Karin Jenson &amp; Bonnie Young)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Dr. Young! Your testimony is wrong!
Karin:
Granny is pretty old, so you should treat her more nicely... Ouch! "Don't treat me like I'm old! I'm not so senile that I would be tricked by a bluff like that."
Edgeworth:
Argh! (That wasn't a bluff.)
Kay:
Granny is a lively one, isn't she?
Edgeworth:
Although I feel like she is a bit too lively... Let's see if we can quiet her down.
Kay:
...Mr. Edgeworth, please be nice to the elderly, okay?
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Karin Jenson &amp; Bonnie Young)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Jenson. I would like you to take a look at this piece of evidence.
Karin:
Errm, me? "I'm the one giving testimony now. Why are you asking my granddaughter?"
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (It's because you two are tied to the hip, that's why I got mixed up! There might be something I failed to hear. Let me try listening carefully to "Dr. Young's" words one more time.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Karin Jenson &amp; Bonnie Young)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Dr. Young. Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
Karin:
"I don't mind looking, but just what is that?" Yeah! Just what is that!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. It doesn't really matter if you don't understand.
Karin:
"If it doesn't matter, then you shouldn't have shown it to me from the start."
Edgeworth:
Argh! (She is quite right... She is quite a feisty old lady... However, I won't be defeated in a place like this!)
Too many penalties
Edgeworth:
Ngh! To come this far, only to lose the truth...! But... it seems there's nothing I can do now...
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Time's up (in Logic Chess, Lotta Hart)
Lotta:
I've had enough of yer time wastin' shenanigans! You'd best skedaddle now!
Edgeworth:
Sh-Shoot... I messed up!
Edgeworth:
I can't give up now. I have to stand my ground... Now... Let's try this again!
Time's up (in Logic Chess, Blaise Debeste)
Blaise:
Y'know... I'm a pretty busy man. I'll be heading back now, y'see?
Edgeworth:
Sh-Shoot... I messed up!
Edgeworth:
I can't give up now. I have to stand my ground... Now... Let's try this again!
Nothing to Examine
Edgeworth:
There's nothing of interest here.
