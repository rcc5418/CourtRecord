Part 2
September 10, 5:45 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Edgeworth:
Wh-What is this incredibly overpowering sweet scent...!?
Franziska:
It smells like flowers.
Kay:
Uncle Badd! Is this it?
Edgeworth:
Hm? Isn't that Detective Badd and Kay over there?
Franziska:
It looks like she managed to escape the bailiff.
Badd:
No... That's not quite it...
Kay:
Aww, too bad. But it's so pretty!
Badd:
I think... you're still a bit too young to be wearing that. But since you found it... I guess I can let you keep it.
Kay:
Thanks! I'll treasure it, always!
Edgeworth:
(Those two seem to get along rather well...)
Badd:
Oh, here... I've got something else for you...
Kay:
Yay! Thank you, Uncle Badd! ...Earlier, I ate one of these with Gummy.
Badd:
Gummy...? Oh, you mean Gumshoe...
Kay:
Gummy is... *sniffle* He was trying to be nice to me because I was gonna get in trouble... ...and then he got in trouble because he lied to protect me... Gummy... *hiccup*... I know he didn't kill Daddy...!
Badd:
.........Don't cry... Faraday would be sad if he saw you crying...
Kay:
...I-I'm not crying!
Edgeworth:
Kay...
Kay:
Oh! it's the mister from before and the lady, too!
Edgeworth:
Don't you think it would be a good idea to go home for the time being?
Franziska:
You're not involved in the investigation, so it's for the best if you do.
Kay:
Umm... Actually, I'm Uncle Badd's assistant! So I'm related to the investigation!
Edgeworth:
Is that so, Detective Badd?
Badd:
...Yeah, I guess.
Franziska:
What!? You were just scolding us like kids to not mess up the crime scene... ...and now you let this child run free!? Why!?
Badd:
...People are free to investigate things outside of the actual crime scene. Yew also had a few things she wanted to look into... Got a problem with that...?
Franziska:
Rrrrnnngh!
Edgeworth:
(I don't have a problem with that, but I am curious as to what Ms. Yew is looking into.)
Kay:
Uncle Badd! I'm gonna go look somewhere else now, OK!?
Badd:
Alright... I'm counting on you...
Kay:
Oh, that's right! Hey, mister!
Edgeworth:
Hm? Yes, what is it?
Kay:
I know Gummy really isn't the bad guy... I mean it... So please... find the real bad guy, OK!?
Edgeworth:
............ (I won't forgive whoever did this. But in the absence of the perfect piece of testimony and evidence... ...there is no one else who could be the true culprit other than Detective Gumshoe.) ...Hm? She wandered off while I was pondering...
Partner
Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Notice anything?
Franziska:
What is this... smell that has permeated the air!?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It's sweet and flowery. Although, at this strength, I'm likely to suffocate from it.
Franziska:
I can't conduct an investigation under these circumstances! We need to open a window and air this room out! I demand that you open a window right now! Hurry!
Edgeworth:
Franziska, one of the windows is already open.
Franziska:
.........I can see that.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... I wonder... Is it just a coincidence that one of the windows in this room is already open, too...?)
Sofa
Edgeworth:
That expensive painting is ill-suited to be hanging on the wall of this room.
Franziska:
I wonder if a guard detail should be placed on it?
Edgeworth:
Why do you say that?
Franziska:
Well, a desperate, low-paid detective might make off with it someday. You never know.
Edgeworth:
(She may be thinking about hiring a guard... ...but it's obvious she isn't factoring in that guard's salary whatsoever.)
Open window
Edgeworth:
(One of the windows in this lobby is open as well... The air-conditioner is working just fine in this room, so why did they open it, I wonder?)
Decorative plant
Edgeworth:
This decorative plant's leaves are shinier than the ones on the plant in Lobby No. 2.
Franziska:
That's probably because it's next to the windows where it's easier to photosynthesize.
Edgeworth:
You may right. Plus, the curtains are always drawn in Lobby No. 2.
Franziska:
The caretakers of this courthouse don't think enough about the plants, do they?
Edgeworth:
(That's because they're the courthouse's caretakers, not a bunch of botanists.)
Tea bottle
Franziska:
What an incredibly strong-scented herbal tea.
Edgeworth:
I fear that more than being relaxing, this scent may make one a bit heady instead.
Badd:
...Yew put in a special request for that.
Franziska:
No wonder she's so violent, if she's been drinking this stuff the whole time.
Edgeworth:
(Neither woman should be allowed to comment on this particular topic. Ever.)
Closed window
Edgeworth:
(I can see down into the courthouse courtyard from here.)
Franziska:
What is that mess supposed to be!? It's like an optical illusion...!
Edgeworth:
I believe it's supposed to be postmodern in design.
Franziska:
More like "thoughtlessness in design".
Edgeworth:
(I can't disagree there.)
Table
Edgeworth:
It may not look like much, but I find that ordinary tables like this one are very useful.
Franziska:
I think it's time they bought a new one. I wonder if they will replace this table if I hit it enough with my whip?
Edgeworth:
(A much too heavy-handed method if I ever saw one...)
TV
Edgeworth:
This television is the same model as the one in Defendant Lobby No. 2.
Franziska:
Looks like the two rooms are basically the same in terms of layout and supplies.
Edgeworth:
Yes. (Hmm... The two rooms are basically the same, huh...)
Hallway
Partner
Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Notice anything?
Franziska:
All that's left to investigate is Defendant Lobby No. 1. If there is anything left to be found, we'll find it there.
Edgeworth:
(Perhaps I should head over to Lobby No. 1 and see what I turn up...)
Bench
Franziska:
This bench is covered with ants. The janitor is going to have a tough time with this.
Edgeworth:
It would appear that they're coming in through the open window up there. (Ants are unusual creatures. We can learn so much from their diligence and zeal.)
Vending machine on left
Edgeworth:
This vending machine is stocked with a variety of base food products. Yet, despite their banality, they're priced extraordinarily high.
Franziska:
I have no interest in anything that is unrelated to the case, Miles.
Edgeworth:
Hold on, I wouldn't dismiss it yet. Clues are often found in the most surprising of places. No matter how insignificant it may seem, we should give all things due consideration.
Franziska:
I suppose... In that case, Miles Edgeworth... ...you will buy me one of those ham sandwiches! For evidence's sake, of course!
Edgeworth:
.........I believe that preserving the crime scene takes precedence, Franziska.
Vending machine on right
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth, prepare me some change.
Edgeworth:
And what if I refuse?
Franziska:
Well, aren't we stingy? I'm shocked that you're unwilling to part with a few coins!
Edgeworth:
Think what you will. Besides, we cam't go around changing the state of the crime scene.
Franziska:
Hmph, you don't have to treat me like a child! I already knew that, you know!
Edgeworth:
(Oh? Then why did you bother asking for change in the first place?)
Poster
Franziska:
I don't believe it! This judge has it all wrong. The star of the courtroom isn't him; it's me, Franziska von Karma!
Edgeworth:
(As long as she doesn't turn evil, I suppose I can live with "just another megalomaniac".)
Fire extinguisher
Franziska:
That extinguisher looks like it would be good at extinguishing any bad memories... With a solid smack across the back of a person's head.
Edgeworth:
Are you saying you have memories you'd like erased at your tender age?
Franziska:
I am perfect. Therefore, I don't have anything I want to erase from my mind. I was talking about you, Miles Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
..................I have no intention of revisiting the past.
Franziska:
Oh? That's too bad. Well, if you ever want my help erasing memories...
Edgeworth:
...I'll be sure to ask.
Defendant Lobby No. 2
Sofa
Edgeworth:
You must be tired, Franziska. Care to take a short break on that sofa?
Franziska:
Surely you jest! Me? Sit on that tiny, dirty, disgusting thing?
Edgeworth:
(But that detective said he could sleep "all 25 hours of the day" on this...)
Plastic bags
Edgeworth:
I wonder if the killer used these plastic bags in a flash of inspiration?
Franziska:
With THAT detective? I somehow doubt he's that quick-witted.
Edgeworth:
So you're saying that this crime was thought out in advance...?
Franziska:
With THAT detective? I somehow doubt he's capable of making such a complex plan.
Edgeworth:
Franziska... When will you learn to take responsibility for your statements?
Bodies
Franziska:
It seems that detective has more brains than he looks in some regards.
Edgeworth:
Do you really think so? Because, to me, in order to pull off a crime of this magnitude... Let's just say that I doubt he has enough mental prowess to be successful at such a thing.
Franziska:
Hah, don't think that kind of subjective commentary is going to prove anything. If you have a theory, then prove it to me with evidence.
Edgeworth:
Of course. That has been my intention all along.
Table
Franziska:
Was this table here all along?
Edgeworth:
I suppose so.
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Well, clearly, it's out of place. When you take the sofa into consideration, that table is much too tall!
Edgeworth:
...I get the impression the two are not meant to be used as a set, Franziska.
Franziska:
! I-I knew that!
Edgeworth:
(*sigh* It seems she's lost her calm sense of judgement in her eagerness to defeat me...)
Open window
Edgeworth:
I suppose it's impossible to enter or exit through these windows thanks to these bars.
Franziska:
I suppose you're right.
Edgeworth:
...Actually, that's not true. I bet a person of small stature could slip in. Franziska, would you care to help me test my theory?
Franziska:
..................
Edgeworth:
Unnnrgh! (Drat. I must remember to be more tactful around the vertically challenged!)
Bag
Edgeworth:
So this was the bag I was to receive with the evidence for today's trial in it...
Franziska:
Aha! I have it! The killer hid himself inside this bag and that's how he snuck into this courthouse!
Edgeworth:
The suspect that was arrested is hardly the type of man to carry a bag of this kind. Besides which, I doubt there is enough space inside this bag for him to hide in.
Franziska:
Ooh... Just shut up!
Calisto Yew
Yew:
What is it, Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Nngh... Nothing in particular, however...
Yew:
Phwwh...! "Nngh," he says!
Edgeworth:
Nngh...?
Yew:
Ahahaha! You did it again! What IS that supposed to be? Your mating call!?
Edgeworth:
(Is everything I do humorous to this woman?)
Yew:
Look, Edgeworth, I'm incredibly busy right now. I've got a mountain of things to figure out and check up on. If you want to talk, you're just going to have to wait until later, OK?
Edgeworth:
(Hmph. I'll just continue with my investigation, then.)
TV
Franziska:
That is one tiny TV.
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe was rather shocked at this, and said it is "huge" compared to his own.
Franziska:
Hah, anything you compare with something he owns will always seem grandiose.
Edgeworth:
(Speaking of grandiose, I'd say that ego of yours could use a little deflating.)
Forensics
Franziska:
Mr. Lab Technician! I want to know what you found!
Forensics:
Oh! I've found some fingerprints that I can't show to any kids.
Franziska:
Whose fingerprints are they?
Forensics:
I think they're the victim's!
Edgeworth:
And what kind of prints are they?
Forensics:
The kind that Detective Badd told me not to show you kids!
Edgeworth:
Nngh! (Argh! That only makes me all the more curious!)
3rd Floor Lobby
Kay Faraday
Kay:
Oh, sorry, mister. I'm a little busy right now!
Edgeworth:
Doing what...?
Kay:
Um... Well, I'm looking for something. Uncle Badd told me to, so that's what I'm going to do.
Franziska:
Let's go. I don't want to interfere with the girl, lest Detective Badd get angry.
Edgeworth:
Yes, agreed.
Water stand
Edgeworth:
It appears I won't be drinking out of this until it's been repaired.
Franziska:
If you want a drink of water, just find a tap. It's all the same.
Edgeworth:
No, actually, the water from this is apparently something special. There was a man here who was practically bathing in it.
Franziska:
............ I know.
Edgeworth:
Ah, then obviously we are both thinking the same thing.
Franziska:
I suppose we'll just have to wait then.
Edgeworth:
Yes.
Defendant Lobby No. 1
Partner
Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Present
Ms. Yew's Perfume
Franziska:
I have no interest in that perfume, or in that woman. Here we are, trying to be serious, and all she does is break out into laughter. It's borderline rude!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... Franziska seems to hold some ill-will towards Ms. Yew. Although... ...between whipping people all the time, and laughing when people are being serious... ...I'm not sure which one I find more annoying.) Aaargh!
Franziska:
You were thinking something bad about me just now, weren't you!?
Edgeworth:
(I take that back. Ms. Yew is slightly less annoying due to the lack of physical pain.)
Tyrell Badd
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd, what exactly was Kay searching for?
Badd:
...Nothing that concerns you, boy...
Franziska:
Oh? And I suppose it has something to do with Kay?
Badd:
...It does, because she's Faraday's daughter... Anyway... Hurry up and get to the point... I don't have time to waste...
Edgeworth:
(It sounds like he'd rather be left alone...) I have something I'd like to confirm with you once again.
Badd:
...I... don't have anything to say to you.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. be that as it may, we still have questions that we need answers to. Now then, first of all, what is the overpowering smell that is permeating this room? Upon entering this room... I thought I was going to suffocate!
Badd:
...It's that ultra-strong perfume Yew wears... She spilled some of it... I was... having a bad time of it myself. I didn't think twice and opened the window... but that smell's still here.
Edgeworth:
Perfume, huh... (So the sweet scent in the air... is perfume.)
Franziska:
Well, it's giving off quite a stench. I bet it's some cheap, no-name brand.
Badd:
...She said... it's a famous brand from overseas.
Franziska:
............ It's a knock-off. Yes, definitely a knock-off.
Badd:
...No disrespect, but... she forced one of those bottles on me. ...Here, little girl. You can have it...
Franziska:
Hmph. I was born for a much more expensive and refined perfume! However, seeing as how you just happen to have a spare, I suppose I'll take it. Miles Edgeworth! You will hold on to this bottle without fail!
Edgeworth:
...Arnngh. (Why can't she ever be honest about her wants...?)
Ms. Yew's Perfume data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
(So now we have the perfume Ms. Yew wears... Just fantastic.)
Badd:
.........Is that all you wanted to talk about? If so, I'm going back to investigating.
Edgeworth:
Actually, I still have a few other things I wish to inquire about.
Badd:
.........Tch...
During the recess
Edgeworth:
So you were in this room the entire recess?
Badd:
...Like I said... ...I made a call to the precinct to get that big lug down here. But other than that... I was waiting for the recess to end in here.
Franziska:
At least your story is consistent.
Edgeworth:
Earlier, you started that you were in this lobby with Ms. Yew.
Badd:
...Yeah, I ran into her in the hallway... She said she wanted to talk to me about something, so we came in here...
Edgeworth:
Then, what you're saying is that until Detective Gumshoe's arrival... ...you and Ms. Yew were in two different locations?
Badd:
.........Hmm... Guess I am...
Edgeworth:
(Interesting...)
Franziska:
Speaking of that lawyer... She seems to have a great dislike for you.
Badd:
Oof...
Edgeworth:
(Let's see... Ms. Yew is the sister of the victim of the KG-8 Incident. And, as I recall, Detective Badd was the lead detective on the case.) I wonder if the reason for her distain isn't simply because you failed to guard Cece... ...but because you were the lead detective on the case.
Badd:
! ...You knew...?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I also know that today's trial involving the Cohdopian Embassy staff member... ...is being referred to as the second KG-8 Incident.
Badd:
.........
Edgeworth:
Now then, Detective. I believe it's time you were honest with me... ...and tole me the truth behind your relationship with Ms. Yew and Mr. Faraday... ...and the KG-8 Incident!
Badd:
..................If you already know that much... I guess it'd be alright to tell you.
KG-8 Incident (appears after During the recess)
Edgeworth:
Now then, I'd like to ask you a few questions about the KG-8 Incident.
Badd:
...It's not exactly a happy story... Other than the people who were directly involved... ...you two will be the first to hear what I'm about to tell... The honest truth behind the KG-8 Incident!
Edgeworth:
!
Badd:
Faraday, Yew, and I... As you already know, we three were involved with the KG-8 Incident. Faraday and I, we were originally on the trail of a smuggling ring.
Edgeworth:
You mean the smuggling case involving one of the Amano Group's secretaries...?
Badd:
Hmph, that trial was just a front!
Franziska:
A façade...?
Badd:
Yeah... But the case became tainted! All because the witness who was going to testify... ...about the Amano Group's ties to the smuggling ring, Cece Yew, was killed!
Edgeworth:
Then, what became of the secretary who was arrested?
Badd:
...His name... was Colin Devorae... To be honest... the guy didn't know a thing about the smuggling ring... But... he confessed to knowing about it anyway... Devorae was probably being intimidated by the big boss man... Just another scapegoat.
Edgeworth:
(The "boss man", of the Amano Group...? He can't seriously mean Mr. Ernest Amano... ...That can't be right. It's probably just Detective Badd's personal hypothesis. What is he trying to do, suspecting Mr. Amano of being involved with smuggling...?)
Franziska:
I suppose it would've been quite difficult to secure an acquittal after he confessed. But the man who killed Cece Yew, Manny Coachen, was a completely different person. But since he's already been acquitted once of her murder... Mr. Faraday, how could you have let him go!?
Edgeworth:
If I remember correctly... ...I heard that Mr. Faraday had an important piece of evidence stolen from him.
Badd:
.........That wasn't Faraday's fault. It was mine... I wasn't vigilant enough. Faraday, Cece... I was supposed to protect them both...
Edgeworth:
(Ms. Yew did mention that as well... About how Detective Badd was supposed to guard her sister...)
Badd:
But... even I, who was supposed to protect them... ...I fell into their trap...
Franziska:
What kind of a trap...?
Badd:
...Hmph... The holes in this jacket are a testament to that trap.
Edgeworth:
! Y-You mean... you were fired upon!?
Franziska:
Y-You were shot at that many times in one gunfight...?
Badd:
.........No. Only about half of these... are from that case... But... the reason I continue to wear this jacket is to remind myself... ...of the lessons I learned... from the KG-8 Incident...
Edgeworth:
...I see.
Badd:
I couldn't protect Cece Yew... and the suspect was found not guilty. We had hit a brick wall... as far as the law was concerned... And that's when she came to the courtroom... the victim's sister... ...That's when I first met Calisto Yew...
Relation to Yew (appears after KG-8 Incident)
Edgeworth:
About when you first met Ms. Yew... It was on the day the verdict of the KG-8 Incident was handed down, was it not?
Badd:
Yes... Faraday and I... We apologized to her from the bottom of our hearts... It was all we could do... But... "Just saying you're sorry won't bring my sister back!" she said... ...and then she gave me a hard slap across the face...
Franziska:
Well... She certainly had a lot of self-control to stop at just a slap. If it was me... not even a hundred lashes would've been punishment enough!
Badd:
...I suppose not... Yew said it herself... that she never wanted to see either of us ever again.
Edgeworth:
But after that, you've seen her many times over, correct?
Badd:
...Yeah. Faraday and I... Even after the KG-8 Incident had come to a close... ...we continued to hunt down the smuggling ring, and got involved in a variety of cases. But... it was no use... We cracked so many different cases... ...but the result was always the same. We couldn't find the real mastermind behind the ring.
Edgeworth:
(Is the ring... really that big...?)
Badd:
It was in the pursuit of the ring... that we met Yew once again... ...It was during another trial... related to the smuggling ring... Faraday was the prosecutor... and I, as the lead detective... ...took to the witness stand. Yew... She appeared out of the blue as the defense attorney...
Edgeworth:
Her client was related to the smuggling ring, and she was defending them...?
Badd:
Yeah... Yew... was pursuing the ring as best she could as a lawyer. I think she defended Rell this time... for the same reason...
Edgeworth:
(Come to think of it, Ms. Yew did say something to the same effect...)
Yew:
I... phwwh... have my own agenda. Phwwwh... I'm still on the hunt for leads regarding the KG-8 Incident, alright?
Edgeworth:
And for that, you have not a single qualm about defending a known killer...?
Yew:
.........Don't put words in my mouth. I said no such thing.
Edgeworth:
.........
Yew:
The only was I had to get close to Mr. Rell was to be his lawyer. I had no intention of covering for him, ever. So don't you dare suggest I was going to.
Franziska:
Hmph. It doesn't matter what her reason is... helping a criminal is just despicable!
Badd:
...You're so naïve... little girl. I could've stolen this lollypop from you, that's how naïve you are!
Franziska:
H-How dare you insult the daughter of a Von Karma!
Badd:
Just like us, Yew felt that she had hit the limit of what the law could do. ...That's all.
Edgeworth:
...The law is merely a tool. There is no limit to it, only the skill of the craftsman.
Badd:
You two... are still too young... But one day, you'll know what I mean...
Edgeworth:
..................
Badd:
But enough sidetracking... What matters... is that we met Yew again... in pursuit of the smuggling ring. ...That's all.
Yatagarasu (appears after Relation to Faraday)
Edgeworth:
You claim to know much about the Yatagarasu... Would you care to share what you know with me?
Badd:
Hmph... What you two should be looking for right now... ...is proof... of murderous intent towards Faraday and Rell...!
Edgeworth:
I agree, which is exactly why I am asking you about the Yatagarasu.
Badd:
...What?
Edgeworth:
The KG-8 Incident and this "second" KG-8 Incident... Both of these cases are tied to the smuggling ring... ...and in both of these cases, the witness who was to testify about the ring was murdered. However, there is one point in which they differ. And that is the presence or absence of the Great Thief Yatagarasu.
Badd:
.........
Edgeworth:
Mr. Rell claimed to be the Yatagarasu, however, in the middle of the trial... ...he suddenly declared Mr. Faraday to be the real Yatagarasu. Then, during the recess, they were both killed. Don't you find that to be the least bit odd?
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! Stop beating around the bush and just spit it out already!
Edgeworth:
I believe that there must be some reason that... ...the two men suspected of being the Yatagarasu were both killed at the same time.
Badd:
...A reason... huh...
Edgeworth:
And so, in order to catch Mr. Faraday's and Mr. Rell's cold-blooded killer... ...I feel that I need to learn as much as I can about the Yatagarasu.
Badd:
.........If it will help you solve this case... Then I'll tell you! I'll tell you the reason why we've never caught the Yatagarasu!
Franziska:
What was that sudden outburst for!? You almost made me whip you by accident!
Edgeworth:
Nnghooh! (It still "accidentally" whipped me anyway...)
Badd:
There are three main reasons why the Yatagarasu will always be one step ahead! First! The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. Second! The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system. Third! The Yatagarasu doesn't leave a single shred of evidence behind, ever!
Edgeworth:
I see. So those are the Yatagarasu's special traits.
Franziska:
...Sounds like an incredibly elusive thief.
Badd:
...The Yatagarasu... ...has never been caught on tape... never tries to draw anyone's attention... ...and would never do something... as low-brow as commit murder...! That's how I knew... that Rell wasn't the real Yatagarasu right away.
Franziska:
But you can't use that sort of logic on its own to prove that he wasn't.
Badd:
Hmph... Listen, little girl. I'm not done talking yet...
Franziska:
Gnrrk!
Badd:
What's different about this time... was that evidence related to the smuggling ring... ...was sent to the police... And the sender was none other than the one who infiltrated the Cohdopian Embassy... ...the Yatagarasu...
Edgeworth:
The Yatagarasu sent the evidence?
Badd:
Until now, the Yatagarasu... ...would always publicize any corrupt dealings through the mass media... ...but not this time... The evidence this time... ...was something only Faraday and I... and a select few others knew about...
Edgeworth:
In that case, how can you be so sure that it was the Yatagarasu who sent it?
Badd:
That's easy... A special card that only the Yatagarasu uses was attached... That's how I can be so sure...
Edgeworth:
And just what sort of card is it?
Badd:
...Here, take a look at this article... Whenever the Yatagarasu wants to publicize something... ...a white card is sent along with the stolen information... But... when we questioned Rell about what was sent along with the white card... ...Rell had no idea what it was.
Edgeworth:
(Ahh, and that's how Detective Badd knew that Mr. Rell was a phony...) Thank you very much. I have a much better understanding of the Yatagarasu now.
Badd:
Hmph...
Relation to Faraday
Edgeworth:
So what was your relation to Mr. Faraday? You even seem to know Kay fairly well.
Badd:
I met him... when he was a rookie prosecutor... Known him ever since. And Kay... I've known her... since the day she was born. ...Faraday and I... we cracked quite a few cases together...
Edgeworth:
Hmm, but you two seem to have made no progress at all in the Yatagarasu case.
Badd:
..................
Franziska:
Did we touch a nerve?
Badd:
...Hmph. I only have one thing... to say to you. ...No one knew more about the Yatagarasu... ...than me and Faraday... That's why... I was called upon to testify in today's trial... ...To prove... that Rell was not the real Yatagarasu... Which I would've done... if he hadn't turned around and accused Faraday... After the accusation, I was asked to testify, but this time... ...to prove or disprove the accusation... But I guess I won't be doing that either.
Edgeworth:
(I sense that there's more to that statement than meets the eye. Perhaps a bit more digging into the Yatagarasu is what's necessary.)
Present
Swiss Roll
Badd:
That snack has quite a history attached to it for me...
Edgeworth:
...I'm not sure I follow.
Badd:
Our recently departed Faraday loved the Courthouse Special Swiss Rolls... ...and his daughter, Kay, also seems to have taken a liking to them. The three of us used to sit around eating them together...
Edgeworth:
..................
Badd:
I guess that's why we wanted to get Detective Gumshoe into them, too. But look at the sticky situation that came out of that.
Franziska:
Actually, the biggest reasons for the sticky situation we find ourselves in are... ...the absolute poverty of that scruff-face, and his unnecessary soft-heartedness!

Ms. Yew's Perfume
Badd:
I'm not a big fan... of perfume...
Edgeworth:
So, exactly what kind of relationship do you have with Ms. Yew?
Badd:
Like I told you... ...we're connected through the victim of KG-8 Incident, her younger sister. I was supposed to protect her... ...but I failed in my duties; just another pathetic detective... After that... Coachen's not guilty verdict... ...sparked our pursuit of the case. Me as detective, and she as a lawyer.
Edgeworth:
(In other words, they're still working together...)
(Clearing all "Talk" options of Badd leads to:)
Bailiff:
Excuse me, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Yes?
Bailiff:
His Honor would like to transfer the evidence from today's trial over to you. So if you could please head over to the courtroom, it'd be much appreciated, sir!
Edgeworth:
Understood. I'll be there shortly. Detective Badd... What does the law mean to you?
Badd:
.............................. Finding the answer to that question is the only reason I'm still alive...
Edgeworth:
(I became a prosecutor to find the answer to that question myself... ...and to play a part in ensuring that all criminals everywhere are found guilty!)
September 10District CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
...Oh, it's you, Mr. Edgeworth. ...*sigh*...
Edgeworth:
(It appears that His Honor is still a bit dispirited...)
Judge:
For the first time today, I experienced what it's like to stand at the witness stand... *sigh* I now have a greater appreciation... for just how hard it is to give testimony.
Franziska:
Well, there's no reason for you to be all depressed about it, Your Honor. As a judge, no one expects you to think about anything other than the verdict.
Edgeworth:
Franziska, there is no need to further depress His Honor.
Franziska:
But I'm not trying to, Miles.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor...
Judge:
Ehh...
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I've come to collect the evidence that was to be transferred to me.
Judge:
He...
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The evidence...?
Judge:
I...
Edgeworth:
Your Honor!
Judge:
Oh! Y-You! Yes, can I help you!?
Edgeworth:
...I'd like to collect the evidence now, sir.
Franziska:
Your Honor... Do you think you can stay focused long enough to at least do your job!?
Judge:
Y-Yes, I'm sorry! And I would, except that the defense attorney has yet to arrive.
Edgeworth:
She is busy with the investigation, so let's keep this brief, shall we?
Judge:
Very well. In that case, please confirm that all the pieces of evidence are present. Furthermore, the evidence that was used in the murders of Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell... ...are also included, so please go ahead and use them in your investigation into their case.
Edgeworth:
Understood, Your Honor. (The pieces of evidence that were used in the murder of those two men... This could be a very good chance for me to find new leads regarding their case. And maybe even something that will finally lead me to the truth!)
Judge:
I've placed all of the evidence over at the Prosecutor's Bench for you.
Edgeworth:
I see. Thank you very much. I will go and confirm that they are all accounted for.

Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Evidence transfer
Franziska:
It looks like your debut trial fizzled out thanks to it being declared a mistrial. Too bad.
Edgeworth:
.........
Franziska:
But now you can take your time bidding the evidence they transferred to you goodbye.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... It's much too early to shelve the pieces that were given to me.
Franziska:
Oh? How do you figure?
Edgeworth:
Two of the pieces were used to kill Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell. Naturally, having all of them makes it easier for me to examine them more thoroughly.
Franziska:
Argh! Y-Yes, of course.
Edgeworth:
Don't tell me... Your forgot about that fact, didn't you, Franziska?
Franziska:
I don't have to answer the characteristically foolish question of a foolish fool! Now, hurry up and check the evidence already!
Edgeworth:
Trust me, I will. In due time.
Judge
Judge:
*siiiiiigh*... *siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh*...
Edgeworth:
It would appear that the Judge is still a bit dispirited.
Franziska:
......... Stop that! You're being so depressing!!
Judge:
Muhwooooohh!
Edgeworth:
You should listen to her, Your Honor, before things go from bad to worse. (...Although, it can't really get much worse for him, other than to be whipped by her.)
Documents on defense attorney's bench

(Evidence that Ms. Yew prepared is just sitting here on this table.)
Franziska:
You know you can't just walk off with it, right?
Edgeworth:
Of course I do. (Ms. Yew must've been caught off-guard by her client's sudden accusation... I wonder how she would've defended Mr. Rell in that case if he was still alive?)

Badd:
You're in the way, boy. Move.
Edgeworth:
You look terribly busy, however, I was wondering what you're busy with.
Badd:
Just looking for something. It's got nothing to do with you...
Franziska:
What is with your terrible attitude...!?
Edgeworth:
(I guess I'm out of luck. I really should get back to what I need to do, anyway.)

Edgeworth:
(The curtains are shut tight.)
Franziska:
The color of those curtains is rather gloomy. For a place where people's lives are in the balance... ...they could've chosen to hang something a little more cheery, you know...?
Edgeworth:
I know, however, I think the designer had more things to think about than the lobbies.
Franziska:
Hmph. Well, as a Von Karma... ...I would afford any location related to the law extra attention to detail.
Edgeworth:

Knife or Yatagarasu's Key (after examining knife and organizer)
Franziska:
So the knife that was used to kill turns out to be the Yatagarasu's Key... It must've taken great skill to combine both aspects into one object so well... Make no mistake, I think this is the key to the whole case.
Edgeworth:
So you're saying... ...that this key is the golden key to unlocking the secrets behind this case!?

Evidence on prosecutor's bench
First time
Edgeworth:
So this is the evidence related to today's Cohdopian Embassy trial from Mr. Faraday's bag.
Franziska:
You mean the evidence bag that was on the table in Lobby No. 2, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Finally, we can now take a look at the evidence itself, and not just data about them. Let's be sure to thoroughly examine them while we have the time.
Franziska:
Agreed. I want to take a good look at all of the evidence from the Embassy murder, too.
Edgeworth:
...And why is that?
Franziska:
Because! I still don't fully understand what today's trial was about!
Edgeworth:
Gnwaaah! Don't point your crop at me just because you don't know something!
Franziska:
And don't you try to order me around just because Papa chose you today!
Edgeworth:
(I see someone is still sore about not being picked by Mr. von Karma...)
Franziska:
...It's all so... real too see the knife up close.
Edgeworth:
So, we have the knife, the gun, an envelope... and what's this organizer doing here...?
Judge:
Oh! That's right! I completely forgot to tell you!
Edgeworth:
About what, Your Honor?
Judge:
They found Mr. Faraday's personal organizer inside that evidence bag of this. Detective Badd requested it be passed along to you. He said it would help the investigation.
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd said that...?
Franziska:
...What a strange stroke of luck.
Edgeworth:
Well, never look a gift horse in the mouth. We might as well flip through it, too.
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Gun
Edgeworth:
This gun... It was originally used to kill the Cohdopian Embassy staff member. When the crime was reported... ...the responding police found Mr. Rell still holding it, which led to his immediate arrest.
Franziska:
And then... this gun took the original shooter's life. How ironic.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. (There doesn't seem to be anything else we can learn from this piece of evidence.)
Knife
Edgeworth:
It's the knife that was used to kill Mr. Faraday...
Franziska:
Who would've thought that such a beautiful piece of art... ...could be used for such a cruel act!?
Edgeworth:
(And it's never crossed your mind that you use your riding crop for the wrong purpose?)
Organizer
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday's organizer... It appears he was in the habit of using it.
Franziska:
It looks like he wrote his strategy for getting Mr. Rell convicted down in here.
Edgeworth:
It appears that Mr. Faraday honestly believed that Mr. Rell was the killer in the case. And it would also appear that he had proof that Mr. Rell was not the Yatagarasu. Hmm... And he apparently also had a very definitive piece of evidence. Yes, I believe that Mr. Faraday was well prepared... ...to discredit any claim Mr. Rell may have made about being the real Yatagarasu.
Franziska:
And he had a way to prove that Mr. Rell was the guilty party in the Embassy murder.
Edgeworth:
(This organizer is a clue straight from Mr. Faraday. I'll have to take my time and give it a thorough read later.)
Mr. Faraday's Organizer data jotted down in my Organizer.
Franziska:
Look, there's a picture stuck between these pages here.
Edgeworth:
It appears to be... a key.
Franziska:
And a rather ornate one at that. Just look at the design on the handle.
Edgeworth:
The craftsmanship is superb... Could this be the "Yatagarasu's Key" Mr. Faraday mentioned in his organizer?
Franziska:
The Yatagarasu's... Key?
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd said something earlier...
Badd:
What's different about this time... was that evidence related to the smuggling ring... ...was sent to the police... And the sender was none other than the one who infiltrated the Cohdopian Embassy... ...the Yatagarasu...
Edgeworth:
The Yatagarasu sent the evidence?
Badd:
Until now, the Yatagarasu... ...would always publicize any corrupt dealings through the mass media... ...but not this time... The evidence this time... ...was something only Faraday and I... and a select few others knew about...
Franziska:
Mr. Faraday must've been trying to keep this secret key safe.
Edgeworth:
As the prosecutor on both the Yatagarasu and smuggling ring cases, that's to be expected.
Yatagarasu's Key data jotted down in my Organizer.
Organizer (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday's organizer... It appears he was in the habit of using it. (This organizer is a clue straight from Mr. Faraday. I'll have to take my time and give it a thorough read later.)
Envelope
Edgeworth:
I took a quick look through these documents before the trial started.
Franziska:
Well, I wasn't even afforded the opportunity to skim it.
Edgeworth:
Hmm...I suppose I should explain it to you then.
Franziska:
Yes, you should. Perfectly and in its entirely, if you please.
Edgeworth:
On the night of September 8th, an Embassy staff member was killed in front of the Embassy. The staff member died of shock due to being shot in the heart. Mack Rell was brought in that night as a suspect and thoroughly questioned... ...because the murder weapon was found on him, for which he was arrested on the spot.
Franziska:
A simpleton of a man, that's what he was.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Perhaps he was, for the weapon wasn't the only incriminating evidence we had. Mr. Rell was caught in the act on film by a security camera.
Franziska:
He was an even bigger simpleton than I'd thought. I can't believe he didn't notice a security camera!
Edgeworth:
The Cohdopian Embassy's security system is supposedly very well designed. He may have simply not been aware that there was a camera in the area.
Franziska:
So... have you seen the contents of the video for yourself?
Edgeworth:
Yes, the surveillance video the security camera took... ...was played during the trial by Mr. Faraday. You can clearly identify Mr. Rell on it. Even the sound of the gunshot was crystal clear.
Franziska:
So the footage included sound, huh? I don't think I'd ever want to see the moment of someone's death in real life.
Edgeworth:
Me neither.
(Examining knife and organizer leads to:)
Edgeworth:
Hmm, that's odd...
Franziska:
What is it?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday didn't mention anything about a knife in his organizer.
Franziska:
...That certainly is odd.
Edgeworth:
The weapon that was used to kill the Cohdopian Embassy staff member was the gun. But if that's the case... ...then where did the knife that was used to murder Mr. Faraday come from!?
Franziska:
Isn't it obvious? It was brought into the courthouse by Mr. Rell! That's the only logical conclusion, right?
Edgeworth:
No, because it's not that easy to smuggle a weapon like that in here. Every person who enters the courthouse doors is checked thoroughly for contraband. Furthermore, the suspect was handcuffed... ...making it possible for him to bring a knife as large as this inside.
Franziska:
In that case... how do YOU suppose this knife ended up inside the courthouse!?
Edgeworth:
.................. (I need to think carefully here... There is nothing related to the knife written anywhere in Mr. Faraday's organizer... However... it is a fact that this knife... ...came from Mr. Faraday's evidence bag. ...Conversely, there is one item listed in Mr. Faraday's organizer... ...that no one has claimed to have seen today! So in order to solve this mystery... ...I believe I will need to take another good look at the evidence.)
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth... Can I take the fact that you have yet to answer me... ...to mean that you don't have an answer for me?
Edgeworth:
Actually, I do know the answer, Franziska.
Franziska:
What!? Then what is it!?
Edgeworth:
One of the pieces of evidence we've been holding has been hiding a secret of its own. And it was through this piece of evidence that the knife was brought into the courthouse!
Present Yatagarasu's key
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This "Yatagarasu's Key" Mr. Faraday mentions in his organizer..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Franziska:
I don't see how that answers my question at all.
Edgeworth:
Every piece of evidence has some secretive aspect about it...
Franziska:
Oh? Then I demand to know what the secret is to this one!
Edgeworth:
Gnrk! (Alright, maybe there is no secret to this one... I need to think carefully here... There is nothing related to the knife written anywhere in Mr. Faraday's organizer... However... it is a fact that this knife... ...came from Mr. Faraday's evidence bag. ...Conversely, there is one item listed in Mr. Faraday's organizer... ...that no one has claimed to have seen today! So in order to solve this mystery... ...I believe I will need to take another good look at the evidence.) The knife was definitely brought in somehow...
Leads back to:
"(I need to think carefully here...)"
Edgeworth:
This "Yatagarasu's Key" Mr. Faraday mentions in his organizer... This is how the knife was brought into the courthouse.
Franziska:
You're not making any sense, Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... You just need to look a bit closer, Franziska, to see what I mean. Don't the color and ornamentation of the key's handle remind you of anything?
Franziska:
..................They do remind me of the knife...
Edgeworth:
Very good. Both the Yatagarasu's Key in this photo and the murderous knife... ...have this very unique design on their handles. Furthermore, even though Mr. Faraday mentions the Yatagarasu's Key... ...the only object we found at the crime scene was the knife.
Franziska:
Y-You don't seriously mean to say...!?
Edgeworth:
It appears that you've finally caught up. And yes, I DO mean to say that these two pieces are, in fact, one and the same!
Franziska:
But that's impossible!
Edgeworth:
Even if that is what you believe, we should still investigate this possibility.
Franziska:
Nnrgh...
Edgeworth:
Now then, let us examine this knife in a little more detail.
Examine blade
Edgeworth:
It's the weapon that was used to kill Mr. Faraday... The handle and the blade itself both have beautiful designs worked into them.
Franziska:
Look! There's even a flower-shaped design in this gold section here. If this hadn't been used as a tool for murder, I'd want it for myself.
Edgeworth:
(...She seems to be drawn to the embellishments. Too bad this isn't mine to give.)
Examine button on bottom
Leads to:
"I can't believe it turned into a key! To think there was such a trick to this thing...!"
Franziska:
I can't believe it turned into a key! To think there was such a trick to this thing...!
Edgeworth:
So the weapon used to kill Mr. Faraday is actually the key the Yatagarasu stole... (This piece of information is more critical than anything we've learned up until now!)
Yatagarasu's Key data updated in my Organizer.
Franziska:
...Frankly, I'm shocked.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday only mentioned the key aspect of this piece of evidence in his organizer. It's possible that even he had no idea the key was hiding a knife blade inside.
Franziska:
But if that's true... ...then only someone who knew about the key to knife trick... ...could have killed Mr. Faraday!
Edgeworth:
Even among law enforcement, this key was top secret... We're looking for someone who knew even more about the key than even Mr. Faraday... Meaning that the only person it could be is the one who sent the key in the first place... The Great Thief Yatagarasu!
Franziska:
! .........Then maybe Mr. Rell really was the Yatagarasu... ...and he was the one who killed Mr. Faraday. Isn't that one possible scenario?
Edgeworth:
No, not really... Especially since Mr. Faraday... ...was absolutely convinced that Mr. Rell was not the Yatagarasu. Besides, as Detective Badd said earlier...
Badd:
But... when we questioned Rell about what was sent along with the white card... ...Rell had no idea what it was.
Franziska:
I see... Alright then, I guess the person who knows the trick behind this key... ...is someone else, and that person is the real Yatagarasu.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It seems that this key is truly the key to solving this case.
Knife data updated in my Organizer.
Examine evidence
Trigger of Handgun (after examining handgun)
Edgeworth:
The trigger -- such a small piece of metal, and yet, it can take a whole life away... I wished that I never had to lay eyes on another gun again...
Franziska:
What's this? Are you afraid of guns, Miles?
Edgeworth:
...It's not that at all! It's just...
Franziska:
Well! I am not afraid of these things in the least!
Edgeworth:
(Where does she find the gall to say things like that...?)
Front side of Swiss Roll
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe and Kay pooled their money and bought the Swiss rolls together.
Franziska:
I suppose they both just wanted a snack that much.
Edgeworth:
Kay was probably saving this one for her father to cheer him up. Not that I blame her. I know the feeling myself.
Franziska:
..................Hmph. Well, so long as we're here, once we solve this case, let's buy some and bring them home.
Edgeworth:
Sure, why not? (Ah, and I mustn't forget to give this to Detective Gumshoe.)
(Examine all evidences leads to:)
Edgeworth:
That's odd. We're short one piece of evidence. And the piece that's missing is the surveillance video that was played in court!
Franziska:
The surveillance video...? How could a piece of evidence just disappear? Where did it go?
Edgeworth:
(The video showing the moment in which Mr. Rell committed the murder... Where could it have gone indeed!?)
Judge:
Are you done with your inspection of the evidence?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I'm finished. However, Your Honor, I am missing a single piece of prosecutorial evidence.
Franziska:
Your Honor... Were you derelict in your duties?
Judge:
Wh-What!? No! I dare not lick my duties! What do you take me for!?
Edgeworth:
No, Your Honor. The most important piece of evidence in today's trial... ...the surveillance video, is not amongst the evidence you laid out for me.
Judge:
Hmm... But I brought Mr. Faraday's whole bag with me from the crime scene. Maybe the tape is still somewhere at the crime scene...?
Edgeworth:
.................. (There's something wrong here... Something about this missing piece of evidence... It would appear that for me to find the answers I seek... ...I will have to pay another visit to the scene of the crime, Defendant Lobby No. 2!)

Edgeworth:
Hm? That's Detective Badd... but who is he with...?
Franziska:
I've never seen that officer before.
Badd:
So, did you find it...?
???:
No, not yet, and I've looked everywhere.
Badd:
I see... Well, then... please continue with the search...
???:
Understood. I'll continue the search. Heh. So you're the one running this show. Prosecutors like you shouldn't even be allowed at crime scenes!
Edgeworth:
How dare you!? Just who do you think you are...!? What was that all about, and who was that man just now!?
Franziska:
Whoever he was, I've never seen a more impudent officer in my life.
Edgeworth:
(Does he even know that we're standing right here behind him?)
Badd:
.........I know you're standing right behind me. What do you want... kids?
Edgeworth:
!
Franziska:
It looks like you were paying attention after all.
Badd:
...Of course I was. ...I have eyes... in the back of my head...
Edgeworth:
(Ah, so that mirror isn't for vanity's sake... It's for him to keep an eye out on who or what is behind him at all times.) So tell me, Detective Badd, who was that rude man just now?
Badd:
...The guy came here... from the Republic of Zheng Fa to study... He's Agent Lang. He's trying everything he can... to revive the lost honor of his family... He's traveling the world... to study different philosophies of detainment... from scratch...
Edgeworth:
By visiting various police departments around the world? He has a lot of dedication.
Badd:
He's still just a rookie cop... but I sense a strong grudge of some sort from him. The guy's... more useful than Gumshoe. .........Even if he is rude.
Franziska:
Well, he sure has a lot of guts to come to this country and give prosecutors a hard time.
Edgeworth:
(I agree, however, I can think of one young lady that statement also applies to.) Anyway, what was that agent looking for, Detective Badd?
Franziska:
Earlier, that little girl was poking around in Lobby No. 1 as well.
Badd:
...Like I said before, it's got nothing to do with the two of you.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I highly doubt that it has nothing to do with me.
Badd:
...Hmph.
Edgeworth:
(Fine, if this is the game I must play, then I will take this opportunity... ...to draw out what he's been hiding and what happened in this room straight from him.)
Partner
Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Notice anything?
Franziska:
It looks like Detective Badd is searching for something.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. I'm curious as to what it could be myself. (Maybe I should just ask him...)
3rd Floor Lobby
Tyrell Badd
Edgeworth:
Earlier, you were in Lobby No. 1, and now you're here in Lobby No. 2... You are quite the busy man, Detective Badd.
Badd:
"Multiple returns to a crime scene brings about success"... That's what we detectives say.
Edgeworth:
I see... In that case, you wouldn't mind if I asked about what happened again, correct?
Badd:
I don't have anything left to say to you, boy...
Edgeworth:
(Nngh! "Boy"!? You'll see. I WILL draw my answer from you, one way or another!)
Franziska:
Would it kill you to help us even a tiny bit in our investigation!?
Badd:
...I gave Faraday's notebook... ...to the Judge earlier... ...That's help enough... don't you think...?
Franziska:
Arngh!
Edgeworth:
Please, we are asking you for just a bit more of your cooperation.
Badd:
...Don't push me, kid...
Time of the murder
Edgeworth:
I'd like to ask once again about what happened around here at the time of the crime.
Badd:
...I refuse to answer. ...Any more investigating you do... would be a waste of time. Besides... how am I supposed to answer questions about things I don't know about?
Franziska:
Things you don't know about? But aren't you supposed to know everything?
Edgeworth:
He should... (Wait, is it possible...? Maybe he doesn't know about the trick behind that piece of evidence! I should try showing it to him. It may prove to be the key to getting some answers from Detective Badd!)
Time of the murder (appears after present Knife or Yatagarasu's Key)

"Detective Badd. I ask that you please testify once more..."
Present
Knife or Yatagarasu's Key
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd. Did you know of the existence of the item in this photograph?
Badd:
...Hmph. Of course I did. It's my job to know everything related to the Yatagarasu case.
Edgeworth:
In that case, let me ask you something. Did you know that the knife that killed Mr. Faraday and this Yatagarasu's Key... ...are one and the same?
Badd:
What!? ...That's impossible!
Franziska:
It looks like he didn't know after all.
Edgeworth:
The piece of evidence which we call the Yatagarasu's Key... ...is actually a well-camouflaged knife.
Badd:
......
Edgeworth:
Mr. Faraday was planning to use this Yatagarasu's Key... ...to prove that Mr. Rell was not the real Yatagarasu. Isn't that correct?
Badd:
I guess so.
Edgeworth:
However, Mr. Faraday had no idea that it was, in fact, a knife.
Badd:
Yeah, I have to admit, neither one of us knew that fact. And if neither of us knew, then no one in law enforcement knew either. How did we miss something as big as this!?
Edgeworth:
I noticed that since a little while ago, you appear to be searching for something. I presume that this key is what you were searching for.
Badd:
...! ...Yeah, that's right...
Edgeworth:
And why were you searching for it?
Badd:
Because... I promised Faraday... I promised that I'd protect that key with my life... But after he was killed, the key disappeared from Faraday's evidence bag... Who would've thought... that the key... is what took Faraday's life...!?
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd. So that we may find the truth, please, testify for me once more.
Badd:
...Alright. But it doesn't matter how many times I tell you about what happened... Nothing'll change...
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd. I ask that you please testify once more... ...about what happened in Lobby No. 2 and what you experienced in Lobby No. 1.
Badd:
...My answer is still the same. And this... is the last time I'm going to do this...
Edgeworth:
That's fine, because I only need this one last time to clear everything up. (And find the truth behind this case!)
-- Det. Badd's Movements --
Badd:
...I was in Lobby No. 1... talking with Yew.
...We were talking about... some trivial things.
...I heard the gunshot... right before the trial was about to reconvene.
When we heard it, Yew and I immediately dashed out into the hallway together!
I saw Gumshoe goofing around there... and then we all ran in to Lobby No. 2.
Franziska:
It sounds like the exact same story he told us before...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. However, I feel that we have yet to draw out all the information that we can.

Badd:

Edgeworth:

Badd:
Sure...
Add statement:
"...I didn't hear any other strange sounds... until that gunshot..."
Badd:
...I didn't hear any other strange sounds... until that gunshot...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd... You honestly don't remember hearing anything else?
Badd:
...Yeah.
Edgeworth:
Is it possible you were so involved in your conversation that you missed something?
Badd:
...I've been a detective for a long time, and even if I were involved in something... ...I've got quite the habit of keeping tabs on everything that goes around me... If there had been some other strange sound, you can be sure I would've heard it...
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... I suppose with this detective, that's probably very likely...)
Badd:
So, the gunshot...
Present Balloon Piece
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Detective Badd... Does this balloon fragment remind you of anything?"
Badd:
When we heard it, Yew and I immediately dashed out into the hallway together!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
And why did the two of you dash out into the hallway straight away?
Badd:
...Because we clearly heard the sound of a gunshot... And we knew it came from somewhere nearby...
Edgeworth:
And how did you know that it was a gunshot?
Badd:
Hmph... In my line of work, you hear enough of them to know.
Edgeworth:
(I suppose it's only natural for a detective to know what a real gunshot sounds like...)
Badd:
But given the circumstances... ...the only person I could think of whose life would've been in danger was Faraday. That's why I ran out into the hallway right away and headed for where he was...
Badd:
I saw Gumshoe goofing around there... and then we all ran in to Lobby No. 2.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe was there in the hallway?
Badd:
Yeah...
Edgeworth:
Why didn't you attest to that earlier!?
Badd:
When I saw Gumshoe, it was after I had heard the gunshot. Having seen him then didn't change the fact that he still could've done the deed.
Edgeworth:
Arngh!
Edgeworth:
It sounds exactly like what Detective Badd told us before, however...
Franziska:
Is there something in particular we should be asking the detective about?
Edgeworth:
There just might be... (No one knew that the knife is actually the Yatagarasu's Key... Reflecting on that... ...perhaps there are other things that we know now, but Detective Badd doesn't yet. Yes, that should be my angle of attack!)
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd... Does this balloon fragment remind you of anything?
Badd:
...It's the same color... as the one Kay was holding...
Franziska:
Oh? So you knew about that girl's balloon?
Badd:
Yeah... I was sitting with her up in the gallery... During the recess... just before we split up, I filled that balloon up for her.
Edgeworth:
Well, as you may have already surmised, this piece did indeed come from Kay's balloon.
Badd:
So? What about the balloon...?
Edgeworth:
I wonder if you might remember hearing this balloon pop at some point?
Badd:
...What are you getting at?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... This fragment was found in the hallway, right in front of Lobby No. 2. Furthermore... ...it was the sound of this balloon popping that the judge mistook as a gunshot.
Badd:
...Oh? So the sound that the judge heard... was not actually a gunshot, huh...
Franziska:
On top of that, His Honor said that he heard the balloon pop... ...about 20 minutes before the trial was to reconvene.
Edgeworth:
Yes, which means that His Honor heard the balloon pop in the hallway... ...when you were in Lobby No. 1, Detective Badd! And if you were in Lobby No. 1 at that time... ...you were close enough that you should have heard the balloon popping as well!
Badd:
...So?
Edgeworth:
Wh--!? Don't give me a "So?"!
Franziska:
We just proved that there is a flaw in your testimony!
Badd:
The cracking of the truth... is louder than the sound of your sweet naïveté cracking... And since you kids don't seem to know, let me fill you in on something! Did you ever stop to think why the doors and walls of this place seem so rugged? That's because they were designed to keep secrets from being leaked!
Hold it!
Franziska:
Wh-What... is that supposed to mean!?
Badd:
...The doors and walls are super thick... the windowpanes are double-layered... To top it all off... even the curtains are made of a special sound-absorbing material.
Edgeworth:
! Then, you mean...!?
Badd:
Since I was shut up inside Lobby No. 1, there was no way I could've heard that sound!
Franziska:
N-No!
Edgeworth:
Gnnrk! (I knew that's what he was going to say!)
Franziska:
Then that means that scruff-face's testimony is completely useless! If the rooms are soundproof, then of course he wouldn't hear any sign of a struggle!
Edgeworth:
Nnghooooh!
Badd:
...That's also why it's only natural... ...that I didn't hear the balloon popping... ...Now do you get it... kids?
Franziska:
Miles! I thought WE were supposed to be the ones finding flaws in his logic... ...not the other way around!
Edgeworth:
The... other way around...? (It's not possible to hear the sound of a balloon popping if one were in Lobby No. 1. However, if we examine this situation in reverse... ...a person standing in the hallway should not be able to hear the real gunshot either. And yet, Detective Gumshoe claims to have heard it while he was standing in the hallway.) Detective Badd... If that is the case, how exactly did you hear the gunshot?
Badd:
...What do you mean, "how"...? I just did...
Edgeworth:
Hmph... It would appear... ...that you have yet to realize the contradiction in your own words.
Badd:
...Oh? How so...?
Edgeworth:
If the rooms are as soundproof as you say they are... ...then how did the sound of the gunshot enter your ears?
Badd:
...! I see what you mean... I guess I'm more out of it... from Faraday's murder than I had thought...
Franziska:
Which means what, exactly, Miles!? In the end, what does it all boil down to!?
Edgeworth:
It boils down to this: There must be a reason... ...as to how detectives Badd and Gumshoe heard a gunshot they theoretically couldn't have.
Franziska:
It looked like we need to examine the state of the crime scene again, huh?
Edgeworth:
...! (The state of the crime scene...? Wait! Can it be...!?)
Badd:
...It's that ultra-strong perfume Yew wears... She spilled (Dissipating the smell - A window in Lobby No. 1 was opened to allow the perfume Ms. Yew spilled to dissipate.) some of it...
Gumshoe:
Uwaah! And way too noisy (Very loud television - Lobby No. 2's television. It looks like it was set to an incredibly high volume.)!
Franziska:
The surveillance video...? How could a piece of evidence just disappear (Missing evidence - Where did the surveillance tape from Mr. Faraday's bag disappear off to?)? Where did it go?
Connect "Lobby No. 2 window" and "Dissipating the smell"
Leads to:
"(It's simply not possible for the killer to have escaped through barred windows...)"
Edgeworth:
(It's simply not possible for the killer to have escaped through barred windows... ...and yet, the fragrance of the perfume managed to escape from Defendant Lobby No. 1. Of course! Incorporeal things ccan move freely through these open, barred windows (Open windows - The criminal couldn't have made it through, but what about incorporeal things?)!)
Connect "Very loud television" and "Open windows"
Leads to:
"(Now then, what else besides a smell can go both in and out of an open, barred window...?)"
Edgeworth:
(Now then, what else besides a smell can go both in and out of an open, barred window...? The answer... is sound! So, no matter how careful the killer was, if the windows were open, the jig would be up. And since the windows in both Defendant Lobby No. 1 and the hallway were open... ...that explains how the sound of a gunshot could be heard (Gunshot could be heard - Windows were open, so the gunshot could be heard, but where did it originate from?) in both locations!)
Connect "Missing evidence" and "Gunshot could be heard"
Leads to:
"(The missing piece of evidence is a video...)"
Edgeworth:
(The missing piece of evidence is a video... ...that shows the moment in which Mr. Rell killed the Embassy staff member. The sound of the gunshot left quite an impression on me when it was played during the trial. The video should have been returned to Mr. Faraday's evidence bag for the recess... ...and brought back here. If it disappeared after that time... ...then it's possible that the tape is still here in this room. Eureka! The evidence that the missing evidence created for me... ...is the gunshot sound that no one should've been able to hear in the first place!)
Franziska:
Miles... What have you been thinking about? Stop wasting time thinking, and let's start looking again!
Edgeworth:
It's not a waste of time to think, for I have figured out where we should look.
Franziska:
And where would that be!?
Edgeworth:
I believe we should examine... the television!
Badd:
The TV...? ...Well, you kids have fun... Go ahead and examine whatever you like...
Begin Investigation
Defendant Lobby No. 2
Partner
Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Notice anything?
Franziska:
We've already checked everything in Lobby No. 2, you know!
Edgeworth:
Not quite. There is still one more thing we have yet to thoroughly inspect. Because Detective Badd gave Detective Gumshoe an angry lecture for touching it... ...no one has examined it since.
Franziska:
Are you talking about the television?
Edgeworth:
Precisely. And that is where I believe the last piece of evidence awaits us!
Crime scene oddity (after examining video player)
Franziska:
So the evidence that we thought to be missing was actually at the crime scene.
Edgeworth:
This surveillance video was placed into the video player by someone.
Franziska:
Perhaps it was Mr. Faraday. Maybe he wanted to check something on it.
Edgeworth:
That is very plausible. However, if that were the case, it raises an interesting question.
Franziska:
Oh?
Edgeworth:
I'm sure you remember what happened. When that detective went to turn the television on, it made an incredibly loud sound. If you had simply wanted to check something, would you have set the volume so high?
Franziska:
I suppose not.
Edgeworth:
If you can understand that much, the rest is easy.
Franziska:
Well, don't keep me waiting... Explain this crime scene's biggest contradiction to me, now!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. With pleasure.
Tyrell Badd
Badd:
...Go ahead and do your investigating. Just don't mess up the crime scene... ...You hear me, boy?
TV
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Open window
Edgeworth:
The window is wide open.
Franziska:
The scent of flowers is being blown in from the outside. I think it softens the heavy air in here somewhat.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Windows in both Lobby No. 1 and No. 2 were opened.
Franziska:
Maybe they were trying to air out the room, just like in Lobby No. 1. Or maybe they sought to ease some of the tension through some fresh air.
Edgeworth:
With Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell in the same room, I imagine the latter to be the case. (But was there really a need to open the window just for that?)
Open window (after examining video player)
Edgeworth:
(Just as with the spilled perfume in Lobby No. 1... ...If the windows were open, that piece of evidence's sound would also dissipate out...! Now, to show what the gunshot detectives Badd and Gumshoe heard was... ...and through where they heard it from!)
Monitor
Edgeworth:
Earlier, when Detective Gumshoe touched this... ...it made a most terrible racket.
Franziska:
You mean when Scruffy turned the television on, right?
Edgeworth:
Actually, come to think of it... ...I don't think Detective Gumshoe actually touched the television at all. Furthermore... ...it seemed more like when a video feed suddenly stops. ...At least, it did to me.
Franziska:
I wonder why that is...?
Video player
Edgeworth:
It's a video player... And there seems to be a video tape inside.
Franziska:
It looks like it. The tape must have stopped on its own when it reached the end.
Edgeworth:
This tape... Could it not be the missing surveillance tape?
Franziska:
...! I suppose, but...!
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd, would it be alright with you if I verified the contents of this video?
Badd:
Sure... Knock yourself out...
Franziska:
Alright, then let's rewind this and see what we have.
Badd:
If I remember correctly... the footage of Rell killing the Embassy staff member... ...should be at about... the 30 minute mark... from the start of the tape...
Edgeworth:
Understood. This should be about right. Now then, let's see...
Franziska:
Nngh... This is...! This is the footage of Mr. Rell shooting the Embassy staff member...!
Edgeworth:
I knew it... The missing piece of evidence, the surveillance video, was here all along!
Surveillance Video data jotted down in my Organizer.
Badd:
...This sound... What's the meaning of this...?
Edgeworth:
(It appears that Detective Badd has figured out the true source of the gunshot he heard!) With this, I think we can figure out the trick behind this double murder!
Franziska:
! Do you mean that you've figured it all out, then?
Edgeworth:
Yes. All I have to do now... ...is show what the gunshot detectives Badd and Gumshoe heard was... ...and through where they heard it from!
Franziska:
.........Nngh! Fine! In that case, show me what you've deduced!
Edgeworth:
(Now, to show what the gunshot detectives Badd and Gumshoe heard was... ...and through where they heard it from! I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Video player (subsequent times)
Franziska:
So someone left this video on play the whole time, huh?
Edgeworth:
I suppose so... Other than the killing, there's hardly a sound on the rest of tape.
Franziska:
Then why did the television make that loud noise when Scruffy got near it?
Edgeworth:
That's probably because the tape had run out and stopped its playback.
Franziska:
...It's not just bad luck, that detective has the worst timing in the world, too.
Edgeworth:
(Someone purposefully left this video on play... The question is "why"...?)
Deduce
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce open window and and present Surveillance Video
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"If the door and windows to the crime scene, namely, this room that we're in, were closed..."
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence... will clear away the last remaining contradiction in this case!
Franziska:
Miles... I believe that piece... ...may actually be proof of a different last of sorts. It proves that today... will be your last day as a prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
Gnnrk! (It appears that I've made a mistake... However, I know that the last riddle and its answer lies somewhere within this room! I need to calm down and think it through once more.)
Franziska:
......
Edgeworth:
...I think there should be one.
Franziska:
Do not anger me with a foolish game of semantics, Miles!
Edgeworth:
Gnnnuurk! (Nngh... I'd better look a bit more carefully through my evidence once again...)
Edgeworth:
If the door and windows to the crime scene, namely, this room that we're in, were closed... ...the killer could've used the gun and no one would've been the wiser.
Franziska:
That's true. This courthouse does seem to be well-designed for such a thing, as it were.
Edgeworth:
However, what happened in reality was... ...Detective Gumshoe, Detective Badd, and Ms. Yew... All three of them heard the gunshot.
Franziska:
Well, the windows in Lobby No. 1, No. 2, and the hallway were open... ...so naturally the people in those locations could hear it.
Edgeworth:
Ah, but then, why would the criminal open the window in the first place?
Franziska:
...To allow the gunshot to be heard... I suppose.
Edgeworth:
Correct. That's the only logical conclusion we can draw from this.
Franziska:
But why was that necessary in the first place? I want a real answer, Miles! I demand satisfaction!
Edgeworth:
Very well. I believe that the killer wanted to manipulate our perception of a certain fact. (What was it that the killer wanted to manipulate our perception of?)
Crime scene
Edgeworth:
The killer wanted to manipulate our thoughts regarding the real crime scene.
Franziska:
So you're suggesting... that the killing really took place in a different location?
Edgeworth:
Yes.
Franziska:
In that case, would you care to explain to me how someone... ...was able to carry two adult, male bodies all the way here without anyone noticing? Furthermore, given that the scruff-face was in the hallway the entire time... ...I believe you've just created your own contradiction, Miles.
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes, well... (I suppose a mistake is a mistake... However, the whole reason why the killer left the window open... Was it not to mislead us on that particular fact...?)
Leads back to:
"(What was it that the killer wanted to manipulate our perception of?)"
When the crime took place
Leads to:
"The killer wanted to fabricate the time of death to their precise wishes!"
Murder weapon
Edgeworth:
The killer wanted to manipulate our thoughts regarding the murder weapon.
Franziska:
Miles... We already know that the murder weapons... ...are genuine! The forensic scientists have already proven that!
Edgeworth:
Nngh! (It would appear that I've made a miscalculation... However, the whole reason why the killer left the window open... Was it not to mislead us on that particular fact...?)
Leads back to:
"(What was it that the killer wanted to manipulate our perception of?)"
Edgeworth:
The killer wanted to fabricate the time of death to their precise wishes! And they used the gunshot in the surveillance video to do so!
Franziska:
! So that's why the tape was left running!
Badd:
You mean... the gunshoe I heard... was from this video!?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Which means that the murders really occurred at an earlier time than we thought!
Badd:
..................!
Edgeworth:
(It must have been during the recess, but before Detective Gumshoe was on guard duty. Someone who has no alibi for that time period... ...and planned this crime out in advance... That person is the real killer...!)
Investigation Complete
Bailiff:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Yes, what is it?
Bailiff:
Ms. Yew is asking for you. She's in the courtroom. She says that she's identified the murderer, but that she wants to clarify something...
Franziska:
It looks like Ms. Yew is still investigating something.
Edgeworth:
Understood. Please tell her that I will be right over.
Badd:
...I'll come along. I want to hear what she has to say...
Edgeworth:
It would appear that the time has come... to uncover the truth!
To be continued.

Edgeworth:
Kay... What are you doing here?
Kay:
Oh, hello, mister! I'm still investigating!
Edgeworth:
But the object you're looking for has already...
Hold it!
Badd:
Kay... don't mind him... Please continue with your investigation...
Kay:
OK! You got it!
Edgeworth:
...Detective Badd, haven't we already found what you were looking for?
Kay:
If it means I can keep her in the dark just a little longer... any little task will do.
Franziska:
Oh? You're more sympathetic than I thought.
Badd:
.........Hmph...
Yew:
I've been waiting for you, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
I've also been waiting... for the moment in which we can finally lay this case to rest.
Yew:
...Phwwh! Ahahahahaha! "The moment in which we can finally lay this case to rest"? Wasn't that when we placed Detective Gumshoe under arrest...? Phwwwwwh. I think we've more than solved this case already... Phwwwwhhkkk... Don't you?
Franziska:
We'll see. It all depends on whether or not your logic holds.
Yew:
Oh, I see we even have a viewer in the gallery! And... why, even Mr. Badd is here!
Franziska:
A... A viewer in the gallery!? I'm hardly just a by-stander!
Badd:
...I have a duty... to see this case through to the end... No matter how it turns out...
Yew:
.........Oh? Is that right? Anyway... I thought you might like to hear what I've slaved away to find out. I've taken statements on every single person's movements... ...during the time when our suspect was in the hallway. I also confirmed that there is no possible route of escape from Lobby No. 2. Therefore, the killer must without a doubt be... Detective Gumshoe!
Edgeworth:
And that's all you have?
Yew:
Yeah, that's all there is to my conclusion, and this case!
Edgeworth:
Sorry, but I beg to differ. In a trial, there is always time for a rebuttal, and we ARE standing in a court of law. It'd be more than appropriate to follow the rules of court, in this case, don't you think?
Yew:
Phwwh... Ahahahahahaha! How absolutely like a rookie to think such a thing. But alright... I'll play along and give you a proper testimony.
Edgeworth:
(If my logic is correct, then I've already won. All I have to do now is to prove it... by showing who the real killer is!)
-- Ms. Yew's Argument --
Yew:
Everyone, sans the suspect, has an alibi for when the gun went off.
Furthermore, the areas around the crime scene have all been thoroughly investigated, right?
I also confirmed that there is no possible escape route from Lobby No. 2.
Which leaves us with one unshakable conclusion, that Detective Gumshoe is the killer.
Yew:
Phwwwh... Now that you have your testimony. I expect a good rebuttal, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...Hmph, but of course. (There is no need to confront her logic head on right now. I should instead focus on drawing out any trump cards she has up her sleeve.)
Rebuttal
-- Ms. Yew's Argument --
Yew:
Everyone, sans the suspect, has an alibi for when the gun went off.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The suspect...? But I thought that Detective Gumshoe's alibi has already been proven.
Yew:
Ahahahahahahaha! Are you joking, Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I assure you, this is no joke.
Yew:
Look, I know you heard from the judge earlier... ...that the detective was in the hallway with Mr. Faraday's daughter eating a Swiss roll.
Edgeworth:
Yes, that is correct.
Yew:
But see, that was 20 minutes before the real gunshot went off, right? And the problem is, there's no one else who can corroborate what he did since the snacking.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... (I see she's done her research well. Which means that I should focus on drawing whatever trump cards she's withholding.)
Yew:
Furthermore, the areas around the crime scene have all been thoroughly investigated, right?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Whether they have been thoroughly investigated or not is for me to decide.
Yew:
Phwwwwh... Ahahahahaha! The scrunched eyebrows and lines on your forehead are back! Anyway, even if you believe it hasn't been exhaustive, the crime scene, Lobby No. 2... ...has no way out other than the hallway Detective Gumshoe was standing in. And because he claimed to be there, that makes him the only possible suspect!
Edgeworth:
But isn't it also possible that someone escaped through a window and into the garden?
Yew:
Phwwwwwwwwwwwh! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! That's the first place everyone looked, silly! The police aren't a bunch of lazy bums! They looked into every possibility, you know. Isn't it right, Mr. Badd?
Badd:
.........Yeah. There wasn't a scrap of evidence... to suggest someone used... one of the windows... There also weren't... any footprints or anything... in the courtyard garden...
Edgeworth:
(I suppose they really did check everything that could be relevant to the case.)
Yew:
I also confirmed that there is no possible escape route from Lobby No. 2.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you absolutely positive that there are no possible routes of escape?
Yew:
Of course I'm sure.
Edgeworth:
And why are you so certain?
Yew:
This is a courthouse, the place where criminals are brought to be judged. If there were an escape route, I'm sure every criminal would be using it to escape. It's just common sense! Phwwh,,, Ahahahahahahahaha!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! I suggest you use a bit more of it in the future!
Edgeworth:
Gnnrk!
Yew:
Which leaves us with one unshakable conclusion, that Detective Gumshoe is the killer.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You may think it's unshakable, but to me, there are still too many unanswered questions. For example, who was it that placed the gun in Mr. Faraday's hand?
Yew:
Ahahahahahahaha! But you're the only one still wondering that! Detective Gumshoe probably had no idea which hand Mr. Faraday used to write with. Even if you know someone, it doesn't mean you'll know which hand they write with, right? I mean... I certainly don't care about that sort of thing. Ahahahah!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... (I'm not about to let her get a rise out of me with such a flippant statement. Besides with, my first order of business is to press more information out of her!)
Edgeworth:
(There is no need to confront her logic head on right now. I should instead focus on drawing out any trump cards she has up her sleeve.)
(Pressing every statements leads to:)
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... I suppose we've really reached the end now. I already have my trump card ready. All that remains is to play it! But before I do... ...I think I should inquire into a little something about her argument.) You said earlier that you confirmed the alibis of every person other than the suspect. However, I don't recall either Franziska or myself speaking with you about the subject.
Yew:
Ah, but there were witnesses. For you, there is your mentor who gave you an alibi.
Edgeworth:
I see...
Yew:
As for the little missy... Phwwwwh... She came to the courthouse during the recess... ...phwwh... and was stopped by a security guard... at the door to the hallway... She gave him quite a whipping for that, or so I heard.
Franziska:
...! I'm the daughter of Manfred von Karma. And I will not be forcibly stopped by a guard, or a bailiff, or anyone else!
Edgeworth:
(Wait, so basically, the only reason Franziska bothered to show up today... ...was because she found out that I was to be the replacement prosecutor...?) By the way, Ms. Yew... ...what about everyone's alibis before Detective Gumshoe was assigned to guard duty?
Yew:
What about them?
Edgeworth:
Have you looked into what people were doing during that span of time?
Yew:
Phwwwh... What kind of idiot do you take me for? It doesn't matter when the killer went into Lobby No. 2. From the time we heard the gunshot... ...to the time Mr. Badd and I arrived on the scene as we dashed from Lobby No. 1... ...the only person who could've committed the crime was Detective Gumshoe!
Edgeworth:
Yes, let's talk about when you and Detective Badd heard that gunshot, shall we? I suppose that if we go by your logic, then Detective Gumshoe is the only one. However, what if the crime had occurred... ...at an entirely different time than when that gunshot you heard went off? What then?
Yew:
...!
Edgeworth:
That gunshot was a trap meant to manipulate our perception of when the crime took place
Yew:
Objection!
Yew:
Sadly, your explanation is very lacking, Edgeworth. The gunshot we heard in Lobby No. 1... Care to explain how that could've been fabricated?
Present Surveillance Video
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"That tape...!?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
It was fabricared through this, of course.
Yew:
Phwwwwh! Ahahahahaha! It's a joke, I get it! Your deadpan delivery is great! Of course, if you're actually serious... well, that's less of a laughing matter.
Edgeworth:
Argh! (Alright, so I was mistaken! The gunshot they heard in Lobby No. 1... What was it that they mixed it up with...? All I have to do is present that piece of evidence!)
Leads back to:
"The gunshot we heard in Lobby No. 1... Care to explain how that could've been fabricated?"
Yew:
That tape...!?
Edgeworth:
Yes, it's exactly what you think it is. This is the surveillance tape of Mr. Rell the prosecution presented in today's trial. This was found loaded in the video player in Lobby No. 2... ...that was connected to the large television that had its volume turned all the way up.
Yew:
You can't honestly mean that the sound we heard was the gunshot in the video...
Edgeworth:
Ah, but I do. Which leads me to my next point. The murders occurred much earlier than when anyone heard the "gunshot"!
Yew:
...!
Badd:
...That's the only thing I can think of, too...
Edgeworth:
After committing double homicide... ...the killer took the surveillance video out from Mr. Faraday's evidence bag... ...turned the television's volume all the way up, and left the video to play. If played from the beginning, it would take 30 minutes for the gunshot sound to come on. And since we now know that this method of time manipulation is possible... ...it opens up the possibility that the killer is someone other than Detective Gumshoe!
Yew:
Objection!
Yew:
Sounds from a television doesn't amount to much here. But of course, Mr. Prosecutor Edgeworth, and Little Miss von Karma... ...already knew that much from the very beginning, right?
Franziska:
O-Of course we knew! Didn't we, Miles!?
Edgeworth:
Yes, of course. We know about the soundproof quality of this courthouse's rooms. (Of course, I'm not about to admit we had no idea until only a little while ago...)
Yew:
That's right, and if the rooms are soundproof, then we should not have been able to hear it. And yet, we heard the gunshot clear as day!
Edgeworth:
.........And?
Yew:
A-And!? Th-That's it, end of story!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... But it's not.
Yew:
!
Edgeworth:
(How should I explain why she was able to hear a gunshot from a soundproof room?)
The door was open.
Edgeworth:
The door to Lobby No. 1 was open!
Yew:
Phwwh! Phww......... Ahahahahahahahaha! You... You really... phwwwh... love to make me laugh, don't you? Sorry, but the door to Lobby No. 1 were Mr. Badd and I were was closed tight. Isn't that right, Mr. Badd?
Badd:
...Yeah.
Edgeworth:
Wh--!? (I was mistaken...?)
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth... you have sullied the name of Von Karma. That logic just now... ...was unforgively bad!
Edgeworth:
Arngh! (I need to carefully think this through once more... There is a reason as to why they were able to hear it so clearly. Now then...)
Leads back to:
"(How should I explain why she was able to hear a gunshot from a soundproof room?)"
The window was open.
Leads to:
"There is, actually, one common point between Lobby No. 1 and Lobby No. 2."
There was a hole in the wall.
Edgeworth:
There was a hole in the wall!
Franziska:
Miles, I don't think that such a hole exists. Because if it did, I think the two of them would've noticed the crime going on next door!
Yew:
Ahahahahahahaha! That's exactly right! Besides, if there's a hole to be found, it's probably in your logic.
Franziska:
Hmph... I was just thinking the exact same thing.
Edgeworth:
Gnnrk! (Whose side are you on, Franziska!? I need to carefully think this through once more... There is a reason as to why they were able to hear it so clearly. Now then...)
Leads back to:
"(How should I explain why she was able to hear a gunshot from a soundproof room?)"
Edgeworth:
There is, actually, one common point between Lobby No. 1 and Lobby No. 2. And it is that despite the fact that both rooms have air conditioners installed... ...a window was open in each!
Yew:
...!
Edgeworth:
Now, we know that the window in Lobby No. 2 was opened by the killer... ...however, a window in Lobby No. 1 was also opened.
Yew:
Objection!
Yew:
Ahaha! It's probably just coincidence that they were both open at the time.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. It was no mere coincidence, I assure you. (Why was the window opened in Lobby No. 1? The answer is that a certain person did something to cause the window to be opened. And the person who triggered that action... that person is the real guilty party! The real killer in this double murder is...!)
Present Calisto Yew profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ms. Calisto Yew!"
Present anyone else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This person... is the real culprit behind this case!
Franziska:
What sort of nonsense...!? Be serious here, Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Arngh! (That must not be the correct person... I must carefully think this through once more.)
Leads back to:
"(Why was the window opened in Lobby No. 1?)"
Edgeworth:
Ms. Calisto Yew! I hereby formally indict you of the murder of Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell!
Badd:
...!
Franziska:
What!?
Yew:
Y... You indict... me!?
Franziska:
Are you serious, Miles!? Why do you think she is the killer...!?
Edgeworth:
I don't understand her motive just yet... ...but of course I'm serious. Because she is the only one who could've done it. Well, Ms. Yew. Do you still feel like laughing now?
Yew:
Ha, hahaha... Of course I do, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
! (My argument must not be tight enough yet...)
Yew:
Although, I never thought things would spiral into this. But I'll have you know I'm enjoying this dance... quite a bit! I guess this means it's time for my own rebuttal now, right?
-- Ms. Yew's Rebuttal --
Yew:
You argue that the window was opened, however, do you have any proof it was I who did that?
Furthermore, do you have proof that the tape was used in committing the crime?
Frankly, I'm shocked at you for going around accusing people of murder like this.
Especially with logic as full of holes as yours!
Franziska:
It sounds like the exact same story he told us before...
Edgeworth:
(This is were it really starts. I mustn't let my guard down for even a second, or the truth will blow away. Now is the time to put the patented Von Karma "perfect proof" to the test!)

-- Ms. Yew's Rebuttal --
Yew:
You argue that the window was opened, however, do you have any proof it was I who did that?

Edgeworth:
Evidence? All I'd need to do is have some prints analyzed and we'd know straight way!
Yew:
Hmph... Be my guest.
Edgeworth:
(She sounds as though she has the room to maneuver... which means... even if we were able to lift prints, they'd only show that it was someone else, but... ...why that someone else was forced to open the window... hmph, that's simple logic. Why don't I try presenting that piece of evidence? I have nothing to lose.)
Yew:
Phwwwwwh, what's wrong? The scrunched eyebrows, lines on your forehead, they're all back! More importantly, are you going to be OK not running a fingerprint analysis?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I'll be fine.
Yew:
Oh! Well, in that case, I'll just continue with my testimony, alright?
Present Ms. Yew's Perfume
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I'm sure you've seen this before, haven't you, Ms. Yew?"
Yew:
Furthermore, do you have proof that the tape was used in committing the crime?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I thought I just proved that it was.
Yew:
Sure you proved that the tape was there at scene of the crime... ...however, that doesn't prove that it was actually used in said crime.
Edgeworth:
...Unfortunately for you, Ms. Yew... ...the fact that the tape was there at the crime scene is in itself very important.
Yew:
How so?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... By the very existence of that tape at the crime scene... ...it proves the possibility that the "when" of the crime could have been fabricated. And that possibility alone renders all alibis and witness reports irrelevant. Basically, it means that we will need to re-examine every person's movements again!
Yew:
.........
Edgeworth:
Whether the tape was used in the crime or not, that we can re-evaluate afterwards.
Yew:
Knnrh...! So in conclusion, you're admitting that you can't prove that it was at this point!
Yew:
Frankly, I'm shocked at you for going around accusing people of murder like this.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Even is you're shocked, that is of no concern to me. I do things my own way.
Yew:
Oh...?
Franziska:
I see that you're not laughing, for a change.
Yew:
...Because I'm shocked.
Edgeworth:
Again, you being shocked is of no concern to me. Let us continue with the testimony!
Yew:
Ahah! Alright, but let me say just one thing. You shouldn't go around accusing people.
Yew:
Especially with logic as full of holes as yours!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Full of holes...? Hmph... Well, I suppose it might be.
Yew:
Oh? Admitting to your faults now, are we?
Edgeworth:
"At this point in time", is what I meant to say.
Yew:
Should I take that to mean that you're just a sore loser? Ahahahahahaha!
Edgeworth:
No matter how full of holes my logic may be right now, if I plug them one at a time... ...I will ultimately make my way to the truth.
Yew:
What a paradox! Take care to not fall into one of those holes before you fill it up. Ahahahahahahahahahaha!
Franziska:
Miles, you remember, don't you? About why a window in Lobby No. 1 was opened?
Edgeworth:
Yes, of course I do. (And that's how I'll attack! I'll present the reason why the window had to be opened!)
Edgeworth:
I'm sure you've seen this before, haven't you, Ms. Yew?
Yew:
Ahah! Edgeworth! I never knew you were into wearing that kind of perfume! It's not exactly what I'D recommend for boys, you know?
Edgeworth:
Wh--!? Th-This isn't mine!
Franziska:
That's right, it's mine. And I received it from Detective Badd, you see.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew, you can pretend all you like, but we know at least this much for sure! That this bottle of perfume was given to Detective Badd by you!
Yew:
Kphwwh... Ahahahahahaha! Because it gets really strong, really fast! So? What about the perfume?
Edgeworth:
While you were in Lobby No. 1, you made a big show of spilling some of this perfume. That's according to Detective Badd.
Badd:
.........
Yew:
...Phwwwwh. Oh, I know.
Edgeworth:
You also knew that if you spilled it, he would naturally move to open a window!
Yew:
Objection!
Yew:
Come now, I've already told you that's all just a big coincidence. After we opened the window in Lobby No. 1, I just left it open, you know? So maybe it was just dumb luck that we heard the gunshot through the window!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The timing of when you were going to spill the perfume is something you could control. And the most important fact about this case is when people were made to hear the shot. Furthermore, it would've been pointless if you didn't have an alibi for yourself at the time!
Badd:
! You mean...?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew, you were the one who called Detective Badd into Lobby No. 1... ...when you saw him bring Detective Gumshoe into the hallway. Is that correct?
Yew:
.........
Edgeworth:
All of today's premeditated events could only have been thought up by you, Ms. Yew!
Yew:
...Grr! ...Ha, hahaha. You accuse me of murder on the fact that I spilled a little perfume. Well, allow me to say this much. I couldn't have killed Mr. Faraday.
Edgeworth:
Would you care to testify as to why?
Yew:
Hahahahaha... Look, I've had a lot of fun today, really. ...But I grow weary of this game of cat and mouse. Let's make this the last testimony, and wrap up this absurd case once and for all!
-- Why It Couldn't Be Me --
Yew:
Accusing someone of murder over a spilled bottle of perfume is a bit over the top.
But I suppose forgery of evidence is to be expected of a disciple of Von Karma.
In any case, it simply could not have been me who killed Mr. Faraday.
After all, I don't even know where the knife that was used to kill him came from.
Franziska:
Miles, her testimony... is flawless.
Edgeworth:
...Yes, but no matter what sort of trick she may try to pull, she won't escape me! (And if I'm lacking in information, I'll just draw it out of her!)

You "believe"?

Ahem... Sorry. Ms. Yew, please continue with your testimony.

Edgeworth:
(At this rate, she will inevitable escape! But if she really was the one who killed Mr. Faraday... ...then she must have known about the existence of the knife!) I'm sorry, Ms. Yew. Maybe you weren't aware... ...however, the knife that was used to kill Mr. Faraday was taken from his evidence bag.
Franziska:
! Miles... What do you think you're doing...!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I'm drawing the truth out of her, that's what I'm doing.
Yew:
Huh? But I don't recall a knife being presented at the trial earlier today.
Edgeworth:
Well, I suppose that's because the evidence was something Mr. Faraday had yet to use.
Yew:
.........Ahahahahahahahaha! Ah! So that's what you're trying to do! Look, why don't you cut it out with the lies. I've already figured you out. There was no knife inside Mr. Faraday's evidence bag. The only evidence he had yet to present was the key to the Yatagarasu had sent. And unless a key can magically turn into a knife, you really don't have a leg to stand on.
Edgeworth:
!
Yew:
...Phwwwwh... Did you really think you could trap me? Come now, be honest.
Edgeworth:
Heh, I never intended to do such a thing. It was all a misunderstanding on my part. In any case, I wonder if you might append what you just said to your testimony?
Yew:
Sure... Why not? II'll even say it as many times as you'd like.

Yew:
Phwwh! Looks like the number of wrinkles on your forehead have increased yet again! Ahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Edgeworth:
.........That issue aside, Ms. Yew, I'd like to ask you about what was inside the bag. You are sure it was the Yatagarasu's Key, correct?
Yew:
Phwwwh... Yes, I'm sure. Which is why I'm completely baffled as to where that knife could've come from.

Edgeworth:
Finally, it would appear that you have revealed your true identity, Ms. Yew...!
Franziska:
Miles... her final statement...!
Edgeworth:
Yes, I know. All I have to do now is to present the evidence! (But what is this... ominous feeling that I can't shake...?)
Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew, I wonder if you might take a look at this photo for me? This is a picture of the key the Yatagarasu sent to the police. However, while it may look like a key at first glance... ...it, in fact, has the secret ability to transform into a knife. Which means that what was inside Mr. Faraday's bag... ...was both the Yatagarasu's Key and the murderous knife! You knew that the key was inside Mr. Faraday's bag, did you not?
Yew:
.........Yes.
Edgeworth:
Well, with the Yatagarasu's Key alone, it's more than possible to kill Mr. Faraday!
Yew:
...Gnnrk!
Edgeworth:
Do you understand now? Just knowing of the existence of the Yatagarasu's Key...
Yew:
Objection!
Yew:
I still haven't had a good look at it. Showing it to me from that far away -- you could be lying for all I know!
Edgeworth:
You would, even now, still feign ignorance!?
Yew:
Ahah! I'm not feigning anything! Buy we can't have you accusing me of a crime with false evidence, now can we? I mean, Mr. von Karma... I've heard some very... interesting rumors about him.
Franziska:
Arngh! Are you mocking my papa!?
Edgeworth:
Don't you dare sully the good name of my mentor! Now take a good look! This piece of evidence is more than real.
Yew:
...Wow, who knew there was such a trick to this thing?
Edgeworth:
Are you satisfied now? But, of course, you knew from the very beginning, didn't you? You knew that the knife and the Yatagarasu's Key are one and the same! Otherwise, someone like you, who isn't a member of law enforcement, and who... ...would never have been privy to this trick, would have never known about it to begin with!
Yew:
.........!
Edgeworth:
Furthermore, the something that the Yatagarasu sent to the police... How did you have knowledge as to what it was?
Yew:
Phwwh... Phwwwwwh... Actually, I heard it from Mr. Faraday. Just before he dragged Mr. Rell off, he told me. Oh, that's right! I almost forgot! He also told me about the key turning into a knife at that time. But he didn't tell me about how the key actually transforms...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
What you are saying is simply not possible.
Yew:
! Oh? And why not?
Edgeworth:
Because Mr. Faraday himself didn't know about the hidden knife within the key! For within these pages, he mentions nothing about a knife!
Yew:
Objection!
Yew:
Phwwwwh... I'm not sure he would've written everything in his organizer, you know? Wouldn't something of this importance be better left to oral communication?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, that is also impossible. Because Detective Badd didn't know about the knife aspect either!
Yew:
...Tchhhh!
Edgeworth:
What would've been highly classified information, even with the police force... ...and is something that even the lead detective on the case didn't know... Why would Mr. Faraday have felt the need to share such information with the opposition?
Yew:
Kphwwwh... Ahahahahaha! Yeah, I guess he wouldn't have much of a reason to... Phwwwwh. Looks like I gave a pretty lame excuse, huh... Phwwwwh.
Edgeworth:
How can you laugh at a time like this...!?
Franziska:
She probably just realized the flaw in her logic, and is actually in a panic over it. But that's not something we need to concern ourselves with.
Edgeworth:
Hmm......... I suppose you're right. Ms. Yew. I'd like to state that I also know how you know the real nature of the knife.
Yew:
Heh heh heh... Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Do you know? Well why don't you put your money where your mouth is and show me?
Edgeworth:
Oh, I will, and I'll wipe that smile off your face by the time we're through! (This is it, the moment of truth. The secret behind the Yatagarasu's Key... Only one person would have had knowledge of it from the get-go!) Who would know from the start that the Yatagarasu's Key could change into a knife?

Edgeworth:

And that is, the person who sent the Yatagarasu's Key to the police...! That is to say, the Yatagarasu herself!
Yew:
..................
Franziska:
Are you saying that this lawyer is the Great Thief Yatagarasu...?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Yew. You used Mr. Rell to lure Mr. Faraday into a trap, didn't you? You, who profess to bear a grudge against criminals, why!? Why do something like this!?
Yew:
........................Phwwh!
Edgeworth:
.........?
Yew:
Hee... Hee hee hee... hee hee... hee hee....... hee hee hee hee hee! ...Ahah! Ahahaha! Ahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha......... .........Who would've thought... that you.................. ...a stupid rookie prosecutor... would see through me...? You're sending the biggest chill down my spine right now, Edgeworth! This feeling of thrill... it's even greater than when I sneak into someplace...
Badd:
Yew! ...You...! You killed Faraday...!? Why...? Answer me! Calisto Yew!
Yew:
.........Ahah! Calisto Yew... huh... That's not my real name. Becuase my real identity is, yes... the Great Thief Yatagarasu!
Edgeworth:
...!
Yew:
Let me tell you something, Edgeworth. Mr. Faraday... was one difficult man to deal with. For you see... he had discovered my true identity. Which is why I had to erase him from the world of law. I made Rell an offer: an acquittal for a little favoe in return. All he had to do was accuse Mr. Faraday of being the Yatagarasu in court. But once we entered the recess, Rell was dragged off by Mr. Faraday... ...which threw my plan into a complete mess. I chased after them, and eavesdropped on them through a crack in the door. That Rell caves to only two things, money and authority, just as all thugs do. I feared my plan was going to be ruined if Mr. Faraday held onto Rell any longer. Plus, if I had let them continue on the way they were, I would've been found out. That's why I had no choice... I had to kill them both!
Edgeworth:
But didn't you say that you despised criminals!?
Yew:
...Phwwh. But do I really...?
Badd:
You...! Have you forgotten... about the KG-8 Incident, too...!?
Yew:
.........Maybe.
Franziska:
What sort of woman would--!?
Edgeworth:
So then, was it your plan to kill Mr. Faraday with the very "evidence" that you sent!?
Yew:
Ha ha... Well, I had a good idea of what Mr. Faraday was going to do. I anticipated that Mr. Faraday was going to prove that Rell wasn't Yatagarasu... ...by using this Yatagarasu's Key as evidence, and that he would bring it with him. Which is why I thought to use the knife portion. With a weapon as well-disguised as this, no one would be the wiser... Because who in their right mind would think something like this could be a weapon? I casually entered Lobby No. 2 on the pretext that I had to talk with Mr. Faraday. And in order to get in with him, I pretended to be worried about something. He then let me hold the Yatagarasu's Key, just like that. He never noticed that I had changed the key into a knife inside that plastic bag... ...and he didn't have the chance to take note of the knife that took his life.
Badd:
...! How could you kill him......!?
Yew:
I knew him for a long time, you know? At the very least, I thought to give him a quick and painless death.
Edgeworth:
But if you killed Mr. Faraday first, there was no need for you to kill Mr. Rell as well!
Yew:
I believe I mentioned why when we were placing Detective Gumshoe under arrest. Something about "having accidentally created an eye-witness"...? And how that led the killer to think about setting them up as though they'd killed each other.
Edgeworth:
...! Then the trick with the surveillance tape...!
Yew:
Yes... I hadn't actually planned to use a gun. The risk was too high that I'd be caught. However, that's when I remembered the existence of that surveillance tape. Which is why I had Rell help me set up the crime scene... ...and after all was said and done, I rewarded him for all his hard work with a bullet.
Edgeworth:
You! You're a defense attorney, aren't you!? How could you... How could you betray a client!?
Yew:
Ahahahaha! Client? If you want to talk about who was a client of whose first, it was me.
Edgeworth:
?
Yew:
I was the client in the murder of the Cohdopian Embassy staff member, Deid Mann!
Badd:
Y.........! You... ordered a hit job!?
Yew:
Ha ha ha... You still haven't figured it out, Mr. Badd? I had Deid Mann killed because he was about to give away info about the smuggling ring. Now , who exactly do you think would benefit from such an assassination?
Badd:
I-It can't be.........! Yew... You're...!
Yew:
That's right... I'm a member of the smuggling ring.
Badd:
Wh--!?
Edgeworth:
How could this...!?
Badd:
You don't mean... you're working with Manny Coachen, too, do you?
Yew:
Ahahahahahahahahahaha! Ahah! Maybe, maybe not. Guess you'll never know.
Franziska:
The Yatagarasu claims to be noble, but you're just another cold-blooded murderer!
Yew:
Ahah! Ahahahahahahaha! That's right, little girl. The Yatagarasu is just another killer!
Badd:
Be quiet! Yew...!
Edgeworth:
Yatagarasu! You can run from the law, but you'll never escape it.
Yew:
............
Edgeworth:
So just humbly accept the judgement of this court!
Yew:
.................. Ha ha ha... Hey, Edgeworth. Did you know? The Yatagarasu has three legs. Do you know why that is?
Edgeworth:
...?
Yew:
Ha ha! No? Well, let me tell you. It means that the Yatagarasu has more than one razor-sharp way to do her work.
Edgeworth:
...!
Yew:
You really are too naïve, Edgeworth. You even handed the Yatagarasu's Key right to me without a second thought. Everything may not have gone according to plan, but I'll still gladly take it!
Edgeworth:
Nngh...! You mean...!? The key was your real target!?
Yew:
*sigh* ...And even after I gave you such great advice... Didn't I tell you to "always keep a good eye on a criminal"......... ...or you may regret what comes of your negligence!

Hmm... I'll go look for her... Oh, and... hey, Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir! Detective Badd, sir!
Badd:
...I'm sorry I doubted you...
Gumshoe:
Don't worry, sir! It's not your fault! I... Well, I lied to you guys too, after all!
Badd:
I heard about what happened... from Kay... Lying while giving testimony is still unforgivable... ...but in this case... you were protecting Kay and her feelings. Looks like you just might have what it takes to be a real detective.
Gumshoe:
!
Badd:
Now, don't you ever lose that detective's spirit, OK!?
Gumshoe:
Y-You got it, pops!
Franziska:
"Pops"...? Watched one too many detective dramas recently, have we?
Edgeworth:
(Way to single-handedly destroy the cheery atmosphere with one snarky comment.)
Badd:
...I should get back to the investigation. I swear... I'll catch Yew if it's the last thing I do...!
Edgeworth:
...Be careful, Detective Badd, and take care.
Badd:
Thanks. Well, I'm off... Maybe we'll run into each other again someday.
Gumshoe:
Umm... So, uh... Thanks a bunch, pal! You're the best! You really did find out the truth behind everything!
Edgeworth:
Yes, well... I'm glad we solved everything before you were taken to prison.
Judge:
I can't believe how much trouble I caused you with my testimony, Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Ah, it was no problem, really! Ha ha ha! I mean, I lied, too, so I didn't help anything! It's really not your fault, Your Honor!
Franziska:
Well, even if we didn't have His Honor's testimony... ...I think that lawyer would've found another way to get you convicted on her behalf.
Gumshoe:
Yeah... I can't believe I was about to get fired during my first week as a detective!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Well, so long as you're not fired... ...you should work hard, give all that you have, and perform your duties well. ...Oh, and one more thing. Kay left a present for you with me.
Gumshoe:
She did? Ooh! What is it?
Edgeworth:
(What was it that Kay left for me -- the proof of their friendship...?)
Present Swiss Roll
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Gumshoe:
It's...! It's a Courthouse Special Swiss Roll! C-Can I really have it?
Edgeworth:
Yes, it's a present meant for you, after all.
Gumshoe:
Thanks a bunch! You have no idea how happy this makes me, pal! I'm gonna eat this right now!
Edgeworth:
Sure, go ahead. (The Swiss rolls Detective Gumshoe and Kay bought together... While the one Kay saved never reached her father... ...it would appear that her sentiments have touched the heart of this detective.)
Franziska:
He's so happy, it's as though he's having a welcome back celebration of his own.
Edgeworth:
Well, I was asked by Kay to give it to him.
Gumshoe:
Whoooop! That was good, pal! I can't believe I got to eat two of these delicious things in one day! It's like I'm in Swiss roll paradise or something! I've gotta thank Kay myself... Hey, wait... Where is she?
Leads to:
"(He only noticed just now...? Was his mind not present when we discussed her earlier...!?)"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Gumshoe:
? I'm not sure what this is supposed to be, but are you sure it's OK for me to take it?
Edgeworth:
W-Wait, that's not what I meant to give you! Please return it at once!
Franziska:
Miles... You're really not that bright, are you?
Edgeworth:
Gnnnrk! (Argh, I made a simple mistake, Franziska...!)
Gumshoe:
Aww, it's OK. It's the thought that counts, anyway! Hey, speaking of Kay, where'd he go, pal?
Leads to:
"(He only noticed just now...? Was his mind not present when we discussed her earlier...!?)"
Edgeworth:
(He only noticed just now...? Was his mind not present when we discussed her earlier...!?) Detective Badd left to go search for her earlier. Maybe you should go join him.
Gumshoe:
Yeah! You betcha, pal! I'm gonna go help him! Oh! But first...! You know what, pal...? Actually, I guess I shouldn't be so rude to you anymore, huh? I'm gonna stick right by your side from now on, Mr. Edgeworth, sir!
Edgeworth:
.................. (I sense nothing but a most troublesome relationship from that ominous statement.)
Franziska:
We should go home too, Miles. We have to hurry and report what has happened to Papa!
Edgeworth:
Agreed. Well, I'm afraid we must be going now, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Roger, sir! And don't you worry! I'll investigate the next case we're on real well!
Edgeworth:
I'll, um... be counting on you. (The scent of trouble is definitely in the air...)
Edgeworth:
Thus, like a bad dream, my first outing at court came to a disturbing end. A few months later... ...I was finally able to properly stand in court as a prosecutor... ...but the detective in charge of the investigation was, as I dreaded, Detective Gumshoe. After that, he became my direct subordinate... I have tried, but words fail to describe the immeasurable suffering he has caused me. But I suppose that's just how things are. As for the little girl who suddenly disappeared... She's now..................
Edgeworth:
..................
Kay:
So? Do you remember now?
Edgeworth:
Yes... I remember everything. Kay... It's been a while.
Gumshoe:
Kay! You sure grew up a lot!
Kay:
Of course! But thank goodness! I thought you two had totally forgotten about me!
Gumshoe:
You know, I was really worried about you after all that! Where have you been all this time?
Kay:
Eheheh! Gummy, I didn't know you cared! After my father died, I went to go live with my mother's relatives. They lived really far away, so I wasn't really able to come back here all that much.
Gumshoe:
Oh, is that what happened...? Well, I'm just glad you're alright!
Kay:
Eheheh! So, does it all make sense now?
Gumshoe:
You betcha it does!
Kay:
Oh, you know what? I was going through my father's bookshelves recently, and...
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Actually, there are still a number of things that don't make sense, Kay.
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
First of all, why did you come all this way to see me? And second... Why are you calling yourself the Yatagarasu? The Yatagarasu is Calisto Yew... the woman who killed your father.
Kay:
No, you're wrong. The real Yatagarasu... was my father!
Edgeworth:
...?
Gumshoe:
M-Mr. Faraday was the Yatagarasu...?
Kay:
Like I said, I was going through my father's bookshelf recently... ...and I found a secret diary hidden among his books. "I have no regrets in choosing to walk the path of the Yatagarasu." That was written in his diary, and that's how I know for sure!
Edgeworth:
.........But that's... That's impossible!
Kay:
What's with that look? You don't believe me?
Edgeworth:
It wasn't just the expression on my face, I clearly said it was impossible just now.
Kay:
Alright, then. How do you explain this?
Edgeworth:
...It's a way of disarming any security system of the user's choosing...!?
Kay:
Yup! That's Little Thief! Truth be told, this is the Yatagarasu's greatest secret. And this little gizmo was used by my father!
Gumshoe:
Wooooow! Mr. Faraday wasn't just a great prosecutor, he was really a great thief, huh!?
Kay:
Yeah, my father worked really hard to steal the truth! But he was killed... and the Yatagarasu was no more. ...But despite that, the Yatagarasu has been spotted again recently!
Edgeworth:
Someone other than you!?
Kay:
Here, Mr. Edgeworth... Take a look at this article.
Edgeworth:
...! The Yatagarasu sent the Embassy... a calling card?
Kay:
Yeah, meaning this person's a fake! I'm almost certain... that Calisto Yew lady is behind this. Because the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a gaudy card out!
Edgeworth:
But the Yatagarasu did send a white card along with anything to be publicized. (...That's what Detective Badd told me seven years ago, if memory serves.)
Kay:
Well, as soon as I heard the news, I got all wound up, and I knew I couldn't just let it go. So I searched you out... so that I could obtain the truth behind the Yatagarasu. Because if anyone can help me find it, I figured it's you, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
So you're saying that I have your father's and Ms. Yew's identities backwards?
Kay:
Yes, because the real Yatagarasu is noble to the end! And I want to revive the real, noble Yatagarasu! If I don't... my father will never be able to rest in peace.
Edgeworth:
Kay...
Gumshoe:
Kay... you're so honorable! I don't care what anyone else thinks, I'll always be here to cheer you on, pal!
Edgeworth:
...Even if you are honorable, a thief is a thief. And if you are plotting to commit a crime, then I'm afraid I can't be complicit.
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth... Oonngh... You guys are not making it easy for me! Who am I supposed to support now!?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... What I want from you is not to steal something. What I want is the arrest of that evil woman.
Edgeworth:
That evil woman... You mean Calisto Yew?
Kay:
I think it's too hard for me to catch her all by myself. But I thought that since you were able to expose her for who she is, then maybe... Please, Mr. Edgeworth! Won't you help me!?
Edgeworth:
.................. Come to think of it, I do believe I owe you.
Kay:
Huh...? Owe me for what?
Edgeworth:
When Ms. Yew made her escape, it was you who saved my life. Furthermore, you helped me with the investigation today. I am not so rude as to leave favors un-repaid.
Kay:
Th-Then you mean!?
Edgeworth:
Yes... That case has been weighing down my soul ever since that fateful day. Perhaps the time has come to settle things once and for all. If you don't intend to sully your hands in a crime... then I believe I can help you.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Thank you!
Gumshoe:
Yay, Mr. Edgeworth, siiiiiiir! Isn't that great, Kay!?
Kay:
Yeah, it sure is, Gummy!
Edgeworth:
(Even though he had completely forgotten about her until just now... Arngh... What is with their chummy relationship...!?)
Edgeworth:
The Great Thief Yatagarasu... After all that time, the true identity of the thief sank back into the darkness. Byrne Faraday, Calisto Yew... and Kay Faraday. The phantasmagorically changing identity of the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and the Yatagarasu's real goal... It would all come to light the day after I made that promise to Kay.
THE END
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right...)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Tyrell Badd)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence stands in contradiction to what you just said, Detective Badd!
Badd:
...No, it doesn't.
Edgeworth:
I-Is that so?
Badd:
.........
Franziska:
I can't find a contradiction either, Miles.
Edgeworth:
Gnnrk! (Curses! Then I must be mistaken.)
Badd:
...Go wash the sleep out of your tired eyes and try again.
Edgeworth:
(I need to look carefully at all the evidence again, and find a contradiction, now!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Tyrell Badd)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I would like to show the contradiction in your statement... with this.
Badd:
...And how will you do that? Because I can't see how you can.
Franziska:
Would you care to explain how you plan to do so in a way that I can comprehend?
Edgeworth:
Yes, well...
Badd:
......
Franziska:
......
Edgeworth:
..................
Franziska:
...If what you're doing right now is thinking up a way to explain it... ...then that means it was simply a guess all along, wasn't it, Miles?
Edgeworth:
Argnk! (Sh-She saw right through me! I can't keep this up. I will wind up losing the truth if I continue this tactic...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Tyrell Badd)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Detective Badd! That statement... is in clear contradiction with this!
Badd:
...Boy, I don't see a contradiction anywhere. ...Now, if you disrupt the investigation any more... You get the picture?
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes, sir! (It would appear that I was wrong... Nngh! I must think things through again, but this time, calmly and rationally!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Calisto Yew)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence stands in contradiction to your statement just now!
Yew:
There's no contradiction here. Too bad, huh, Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Arnnnnnnnnnnnngh...! (She took the wind out of my sails with a single sentence! But I must keep my composure. I can't allow her to gain the upper hand...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Calisto Yew)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your statement... ...is nothing before this perfect piece of evidence!
Yew:
I don't think I'd call that "perfect".
Edgeworth:
Hmph... If you don't try to verify it, how will you know?
Yew:
Phwwh... I guess so! Ahahaha! Oh, I just love the way you say that with such confidence! But just as you said, you can only say something is perfect after you've verified it! Now try presenting evidence to me again, but this time, in the correct way, rookie!
Edgeworth:
.........Gnrk! (I was a fool to claim that it was perfect!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Calisto Yew)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence reveals the hole in your logic!
Yew:
...Phwwh... Phwwwwwwwwh! Ahah! Ahahahahahahahaha! Before you try to prove there are holes in my logic, you should prove something else.
Edgeworth:
.........? And that would be?
Yew:
Whether or not you really are a diciple of Manfred von Karma. With such weak logic, I'm not sure you're cut out to be a prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
Gnwooooooohh!
Too many penalties (in Defendant Lobby No. 1)
Badd:
...Your investigation has dragged on for long enough.
Edgeworth:
B-But, wait!
Badd:
...Go on, get out of here. I've got work to do.
Edgeworth:
(Nngh! No, I can't be tossed off the case now...!)
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (during argument of Yew, in Courtroom No. 3)
Yew:
Ahahahahahaha! Looks like you're at the end of your rope. We already have a suspect, so you can spare me the rest of your long-winded speech. Mr. Badd... I leave the rest in your capable hands.
Badd:
..................
Edgeworth:
I'm not done with you yet!
Yew:
Phwwh! Ahahahahahaha! Maybe not, but I'm done with you. See you around, Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
(Nngh! I can't let her get away, not now...!)
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Nothing to Examine
Edgeworth:
There's nothing unusual about this area.
