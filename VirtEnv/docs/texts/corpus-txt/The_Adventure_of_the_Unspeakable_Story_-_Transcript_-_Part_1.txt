The Adventure of the Unspeakable Story
Anime cutscene
'It's coming!' Sholmes' cry pierced through the thick wall of fog around us. Wisps of vapour flowed over the pistol as I cocked it, and I waited breathlessly in the stillness. The silence lasted for what seemed an eternity until, at last, it appeared. From the shadows of the cloud, an enormous beast sprang out upon us. A hound it was, but not such a hound as any mortal has ever seen. Its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, the whole of its ox-sized body was outlined in white-hot flames. Its rumbling pant and hideous howl... So terrified was I that I began to tremble with fear. 'Look well, Wilson!' Sholmes declared, gazing upon the mystical beast. 'For this! This is the diabolical Hound of the Baskervilles!'
Our first two months in London passed by in a flash. In that disconcerting courtroom experience we were first thrown into on the day we arrived in the country... ...and in Soseki-san's terrible ordeal that had followed closely behind, we had emerged victorious. However... ...there then came an abrupt end to our opportunities to appear in court. Which was hardly surprising, of course... ...since I was nothing more than an amateur, an unknown student of law from a faraway land. So life in our little office was very quiet. That is... ...until it was shattered one day, by that fateful telegram...
Examine evidence
Armband
Insignia on front
Ryunosuke:
These are the Scales of Justice. They're a symbol of the defence, aren't they?
Susato:
Yes, that's right. The scales are a symbol of fairness, to show that all are treated equally in the eyes of the law. And they're a warning to those who enter the courtroom without an impartial mind.
Ryunosuke:
But if they're the mark of the defence... ...it would be more auspicious if they were weighing more heavily on the 'not guilty' side, I think.
Susato:
......... Very impartial, I'm sure.
Inside of armband
Ryunosuke:
The lawyer's name is embroidered on the inside here, look. 'Kazuma Asogi'... This was his band, of course.
Susato:
He had his heart set on this study tour in Great Britain.
Ryunosuke:
I'm sure he would have found the truth he longed for here. (...But he lost his life before he even had the chance to see the place.)
Susato:
I have such a strong sense of his hopes and dreams when I look at this armband, though.
15th April, 9:13 a.m.
Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy
*Knock knock knock*
That morning... ...I was woken by the unreserved knocking on the door by the telegram boy. But after he'd gone... ...Susato-san's behaviour became very obviously strange.
Ryunosuke:
Um...Susato-san?
Susato:
Yes! Is it time to leave for court already? Let me see... What case is it today?
Ryunosuke:
I...don't think I'm scheduled to defend anyone at the moment, am I?
Susato:
Oh! No, of course not. How silly of me.
Ryunosuke:
But I think Iris said she would make us breakfast this morning. So shall we go down to Mr Sholmes's suite?
Susato:
Yes! Iris makes the most delicious breakfast food. 
Ryunosuke:
She does, doesn't she?
Susato:
And once our bellies are full, we can leave for court in fighting fit form! Let me see... What case is it today?
Ryunosuke:
(Here we go again...)
Examine
Spade
Ryunosuke:
That spade has been in here since we started renting the place. 
Susato:
Oh, that's not a spade, Naruhodo-san. It's a shovel. 
Ryunosuke:
No, shovels are for digging. That's for scooping up loose material. It's a spade. 
Susato:
No, spades are for digging. That's for scooping up loose material. It's a shovel. 
Ryunosuke:
...I don't want to dig a hole for myself. So let's leave it.
Tea set
Ryunosuke:
So this is the tea set that Susato-san brought with her from Japan. Let's hope she hasn't noticed me slipping sugar and milk into my cup when she makes it. It's just so bitter!
Susato:
Tea is a drink to be enjoyed, Naruhodo-san. You really don't have to force yourself to drink it, you know. I don't like to see you screw up your face so!
Stove or kettle
Ryunosuke:
It's spring at last, and the weather is warmer now. But I love the smell of the fire and the steam rising from the kettle. 
Susato:
Oh, would you like some tea, Naruhodo-san?
Ryunosuke:
Thank you, Susato-san, but I'm alright for now. (With the green tea Susato-san makes me from time to time and Iris's unique herbal infusions... ...this place is paradise for a true tea-lover.)
Susato:
Green tea is such a wonderful accompaniment to British teacakes, don't you think?
Desk in back
Ryunosuke:
We've only been here in London for about two months, but my desk is starting to look a little messy already. 
Susato:
You could tidy up once in a while!
Ryunosuke:
Susato-san, I always say... ...making a mess is a small sacrifice to pay for being able to further your studies. And time spent tidying up is time you can't devote to the same cause. 
Susato:
And time spent on ridiculous arguments is time that could be better spent on some simple housework. 
Ryunosuke:
......... (She wins. But I'm supposed to be the lawyer here...)
Daruma doll
Ryunosuke:
Ah, the daruma doll I brought with me from home. Still with only one eye coloured in. I said I'd colour the other eye once I won my first court case here in Britain, but...
Susato:
But you have won, haven't you? Twice, in fact.
Ryunosuke:
Because I feel as though I'm still lacking as a lawyer. I tell you what. Why don't you colour the other eye in once you think I'm a proper, fully-fledged lawyer?
Susato:
If you insist!
Door
Ryunosuke:
Do you know, I've never seen inside your room there, Susato-san? I've never even peeped inside. 
Susato:
I, I should think so, too! A young maiden's private chamber is a place of bitter-sweet secrets, you know!
Ryunosuke:
(...Whatever you say, young maiden.)
Aquarium
Ryunosuke:
We were rather lucky to find that old 'aquarium' left behind here. The prawns we put in there are doing rather well. And the anemones, too. 
Susato:
It's a wonderful invention, isn't it? The sea, behind glass, inside your room... Another example of Great Britain's greatness! 
Ryunosuke:
Having to clean it out and change the water isn't so great, though, is it?
Desk in front
Ryunosuke:
(Ah, this must be the telegram. Let's see...)
Susato:
AAAGH!!! No! You mustn't look at that! Not under any circumstances!
Ryunosuke:
Al-Alright! I won't!
Susato:
I'm sorry, Naruhodo-san, but you can be very mischievous at times. 
Ryunosuke:
(Then put the telegram away, if you don't want people looking at it!)
Converse
The telegram
Ryunosuke:
So...what was it about? The telegram that was delivered this morning, I mean.
Susato:
Oh! A, a telegram? ...I don't know what you're talking about!
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Sorry, but you're not going to get away with that.
Susato:
Well! ...I didn't think I would! ......... Actually, um... ...don't give it a moment's thought! It's...nothing. Nothing interesting. ...Boring, in fact! ...Ahem. It was just a boring old telegram!
Ryunosuke:
(...That's three times now that she's tried and failed to convince me it was nothing.)
Susato:
......... I promise that I'll tell you about it at some point.
Ryunosuke:
...Alright, I understand.
Soseki-san
Ryunosuke:
I suppose Soseki-san will have arrived back in Japan by now, won't he?
Susato:
Yes, I should think so. He left immediately after that terrible ordeal... ...which would mean he should have completed the voyage already, or be just a few days away.
Ryunosuke:
A fortnight ago we had that very long telegram from him, do you remember? Complaining of seasickness. But by and large, it seems the voyage has been going well. .........
Susato:
Is something wrong, Naruhodo-san?
Ryunosuke:
I was just wondering...what might have become of Soseki-san had he stayed in London, that's all.
Susato:
You mean...as regards Lord van Zieks? The Reaper?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. I can't help wondering if seasickness would have paled into insignificance in that case...
The Reaper (appears after "Soseki-san")
Ryunosuke:
What is it they say? That no one who stands in the dock can be saved from the Reaper...right? (Like the way that nightmarish trial ended on the very day we arrived in London...)
Susato:
Even two months on, the cause of that dreadful fire is still a mystery.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, but at least Soseki-san is safely out of the country now. Presumably that means...
Susato:
...That the curse of the Reaper can only take effect within the confines of the city of London perhaps?
Ryunosuke:
Even if that's the case, it's little comfort. I have a terrible sense of foreboding.
Susato:
If the legend of the Reaper is to be believed, it would mean he wields the sword of justice himself.
Ryunosuke:
Come to think of it, I wonder what he's been up to these past two months. Surely...not wielding that sword against more acquitted defendants...
Susato:
No, I don't think so. Apparently, Lord Van Zieks hasn't appeared in court once since our last encounter.
Ryunosuke:
Oh?
Susato:
Yes, since Soseki-san's trial. He's...withdrawn from judicial service again, it seems.
Ryunosuke:
Really? (Just like before...when he wasn't seen in court at all for several years.) So, it's just been me who's had to face him in his recent spate of trials, then? Ugh...just my luck.
Susato:
......... I wonder if luck doesn't come into it.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? What was that?
Susato:
Oh... Nothing. Never mind.
Present
Armband
Susato:
...It means a great deal to me, you know. That you cherish his armband so, and wear it each time you appear in court.
Ryunosuke:
Well, it's very important to me. It's what shows that I'm a lawyer. And...whenever I wear it, I feel as though it gives me strength...through Kazuma. I absolutely can't be without it. Especially when I'm at a critical point in a trial.
Susato:
But...just the other day I noticed you wearing it when we went to visit that park.
Ryunosuke:
...Sometimes I forget to take it off.
15th April
Sholmes's Suite
Iris:
Morning, Runo! Morning, Susie!
Susato:
Good morning, Iris!
Ryunosuke:
Um...Iris...
Iris:
What is it, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
What is that terrible noise? It sounds like a cat being strangled.
Iris:
Ah, yes... You noticed that, did you? Hurley isn't in the best form this morning, it seems. 
Sholmes:
Hello...
Susato:
Hello...Mr Sholmes.
Ryunosuke:
G-Good morning. 
Sholmes:
......... A good morning to die perhaps...
Ryunosuke:
...Has something happened, Mr Sholmes? You look miserable, and...the way you were playing the violin before...
Sholmes:
Hmph. My analytical mind is dead. Music is dead. The world...is dead. Damn this blanched existence! ...That's all it is, my dear fellow. Nothing of consequence. 
Susato:
I'm afraid I don't understand. 
Sholmes:
Well, Iris? Isn't it time we ate? Some dry toast and insipid coffee for me...if it's not too much trouble. 
???:
Miaow...
Ryunosuke:
Oh look, it's Wagahai. 
Susato:
Good morning, boy. 
Wagahai:
Miaow. 
Ryunosuke:
......... (That must be some sort of tiny door for cats to use. But how did it get there?)
Iris:
Well then, everyone, time for breakfast! 
Susato:
Oh, wonderful! Let me help you, Iris. 
Sholmes:
Ugh...it would indeed be a fine day to die...
Ryunosuke:
(Ah, I knew something looked different... Something's missing from Mr Sholmes's desk.)
Examine
Desk on left
Ryunosuke:
Look at Mr Sholmes's desk. It's completely clear. (Isn't that enormous machine usually on it?)
Susato:
We can never hope to understand what goes on in the great detective's mind, Mr Naruhodo. Why, next time we're invited, we may find he's vacated the entire suite! 
Ryunosuke:
(That's scarily plausible, actually...)
Shelves on left
Ryunosuke:
There's all sorts on these shelves: chemistry apparatus, books, papers and...lots of things I've never seen before. It's all heaped up so high, I can't help feeling that the whole lot is going to topple at any moment. 
Susato:
Oh, it's such a charmingly untidy collection of paraphernalia, isn't it? 
Ryunosuke:
It just looks messy to me, like my desk. 
Susato:
But you, Mr Naruhodo, must learn to tidy up after yourself! 
Ryunosuke:
(...No favouritism there then.)
Initials on wall
Ryunosuke:
Ah yes, the letters 'V' and 'R' inscribed on the wall...in bullet holes. Isn't it the initials of the Queen or something?
Susato:
It's so delightful to see it in the flesh, having read about it in the stories! It was so inspiring! I've fired a hundred arrows into my own wall at home to make the character for 'Su' of Susato, you know.
Ryunosuke:
...Su...per? But perhaps there are some things the great detective does that you don't need to copy?
Fireplace
Ryunosuke:
The fire's burning comfortingly in the grate again today. It's a very different feeling to a Japanese hibachi somehow. 
Susato:
Oh! Look at that photographic print of a lady displayed on the mantelpiece! Could it be...? Yes! It must be! It's the woman! Oh, how exciting!
Ryunosuke:
(...Is that supposed to mean something to me?)
Chest
Ryunosuke:
It looks like that huge metal chest is being used as a table for tea and coffee. It seems very sturdy, with an equally sturdy lock. 
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! You mustn't go around opening things! I always have to keep an eye on you, don't I? You're very mischievous. 
Ryunosuke:
(...How did you come to that conclusion?)
Iris Wilson
Wagahai
Ryunosuke:
Mr Natsume's cat seems to have settled in to his new home, then. 
Iris:
Oh yes! And I've become very attached to little Waggy. 
Sholmes:
Hmph. It would appear his previous owner is completely forgotten to him. Cats are unfeeling creatures. Their mews as empty as the hearts of the Muses. 
Iris:
If Mr Natsume had no intention of taking Waggy back to Japan, I wonder why he kept him in the first place. 
Ryunosuke:
I expect he would have taken him if he could. But pets are strictly forbidden aboard steamships in our experience. 
Susato:
And for good reason! Terrible things can happen if the rules of passage are not obeyed. 
Iris:
Well, I don't mind. Because Waggy is adorable!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, he really is. Oh yes, what about the door? I don't remember seeing that tiny thing in the main door before. Where did that come from? 
Iris:
Oh, you noticed? You are observant, Runo! Look! I used this! It's my latest invention! 
Ryunosuke:
What...what is that?
Iris:
I call it...the Cat-Flapomat!
Susato:
Gosh! A machine for making doors just for cats?
Iris:
That's right. It can make a cat flap for a little furry friend like Waggy in seconds! And it can do it in any door at all, no matter what it's made of! It's very powerful, you see. 
Ryunosuke:
...Wouldn't it have been quicker just to make the cat flap, rather than making a machine to make the cat flap?
Iris:
Well! Yes, maybe... But now I can make cat flaps anywhere I like!
Susato:
Oh, I think it's wonderful! You must make one for us in the door of our office upstairs, Iris!
Ryunosuke:
(She really knows how to come up with...unconventional inventions, this girl...)
Iris:
Hehehe!
Shelf to the right of fireplace
Ryunosuke:
These are all mementoes of Mr Sholmes's past cases, I think. If he'd been involved in my case, I wonder if the beef steak from La Carneval would be on display here... 
Susato:
A mystery shoe, a curious hammer, some mysterious dancing men, a bust of Napoleon... Aah, what an entrancing collection! 
Ryunosuke:
It looks like an untidy assortment of junk to me, rather like what's on my own shelves. 
Susato:
Well you really ought to learn to keep your things in order, Mr Naruhodo. 
Ryunosuke:
(...No, no favouritism there at all.)
Tea set on cart or table
Ryunosuke:
Iris's beautiful tea set is there on the table as usual. A cup of one of her special herbal blends always helps me to relax when I'm feeling the strain. 
Susato:
The English pastime of tea has many similarities with our own tea ceremony customs, don't you think? It's the idea of hospitality behind it! That's the essence of tea!
Blackboard
Ryunosuke:
This is where Iris notes down ideas, isn't it? Let's see...what does it say today? Ah, 'The Boscombe Valley Mystery'. 
Susato:
Ooh, how intriguing! It must be the title of Iris's latest work! Oh my! I wonder what fantastic tale awaits us! 
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san looks like an angel, but I bet she's dreaming of the most unsavoury crime you could imagine.) 
White shelf behind chandelier
Ryunosuke:
That's a charming little white shelf. And full of charming little bottles, too. ...But the contents of them aren't quite so charming, it seems. 
Susato:
Science is the future, Mr Naruhodo! You can't deny it! I'm saving my money so that I can buy some chemistry apparatus as well. 
Ryunosuke:
Law...chemistry...takedown throws... What diverse skills you boast, Miss Susato! 
Susato:
As useful as they are, I'm not sure that my throwing skills are worthy of inclusion in that list.
Typewriter or desk on right
Ryunosuke:
Come to think of it, I haven't seen Iris doing much writing recently. But there's paper already set up in the typewriter, look, as if she's about to start. 
Susato:
That reminds me, when I mentioned that Iris was in the process of writing a full-fledged novel... ...Mr Natsume was most impressed. 
Ryunosuke:
Ah yes, Mr Natsume...
Susato:
'That's what I'll be doing, too, once I'm back in Japan!' he said through tightly clenched fists and teeth...
Converse
Wanting to die
Ryunosuke:
You seem to be very unhappy this morning, Mr Sholmes. What's happened? 
Sholmes:
......... ...It used to be the case...that in my hands... ...this violin sung like the dawn chorus. Its mellisonant tones would make flowers bloom.
Ryunosuke:
It would? 
Sholmes:
But now...the Muses are unamused with me. The goddesses of music have thrown me over.
Susato:
Whatever do you mean, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
For hours, I have bowed. For days, even. Through the night I have endeavoured, to no avail. That sound...my tone...is lost. That brilliant, clear, unwavering tone...gone forever! No more recitals of unbridled emotion! 
Iris:
Well, you haven't been practising much lately, have you, Hurley?
Ryunosuke:
Don't worry, I'm sure it will come back to you in time.
Sholmes:
Heed my words, Mr Naruhodo. The goddesses of the arts are fickle. One day they bestow genius on a man, the next they unmercifully withdraw it.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...dear.
Sholmes:
Argh! Why is this happening to me?! If they take the turn I have for the violin from me, what is left, for pity's safe? What is left?!
Ryunosuke:
......... (...Um, deduction perhaps? Isn't that what you're known for?)
The missing machine
Susato:
Mr Sholmes...I don't like to pry, but... ...your desk looks rather empty today.
Sholmes:
Ah...well done, Miss Susato. Your observational skills do you credit.
Susato:
Oh, no, Mr Sholmes. They pale into insignificance when compared to yours.
Ryunosuke:
(You'd struggle not to notice, wouldn't you?)
Iris:
You mean Hurley's Great Analytiscope? That's at Windibank's now.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? It's at a windy bank?
Iris:
No, Windibank's! The pawnbrokery!
Susato:
Pawn...? WHAAAT?!
Ryunosuke:
You mean you've pawned that enormous machine of yours?
Sholmes:
...It has some considerable value, you see. Quite undeservingly.
Susato:
But! ...Isn't it a very important machine for your work? I do wish you had consulted us if, if your situation had become so desperate. I should have gladly passed what little income I have to you.
Sholmes:
...Dear madam, things are far from desperate.
Susato:
But, but the pawnbroker has your wonderful machine! How can it be anything but desperate?
Sholmes:
...Making use of a pawnbrokery is quite ordinary here in London, I assure you.
Ryunosuke:
It is? It doesn't sound ordinary at all. 
Sholmes:
It would seem that neither of you fully understand how pawnbroking works.
Ryunosuke:
Oh... (What's to understand exactly?)
How pawnbroking works (appears after "The missing machine")
Ryunosuke:
Um, what did you mean when you said we didn't fully understand how pawnbroking works?
Sholmes:
To the people of London, pawnbrokeries are akin to banks.
Susato:
Banks?
Sholmes:
On Mondays, merchants relinquish their finest jackets and trappings to their pawnbroker of choice. With the money they receive in return, they are able to trade happily through the week.
Iris:
And then on Saturdays, they go to recover their things using the money they've earnt.
Susato:
I had no idea! This has been a fascinating lesson for us!
Iris:
Everyone does it, you see. Especially people in Inner London.
Sholmes:
And should they have money to spare, they would purchase another fine jacket. Not to wear, obviously. But to pawn, should the need arise.
Susato:
Oh! How ingenious!
Iris:
So whenever we have something that's getting in the way, we leave it at Windibank's, you see.
Sholmes:
A pawnbrokery can be thought of as an extremely secure vault.
Ryunosuke:
(Who would have thought that even pawnbrokers are different here in Great Britain?)
Iris:
Of course, you have to watch Hurley with it. Sometimes he pawns things he really shouldn't. ...Don't you, Hurley?
Sholmes:
......... What does it matter? The world is dead to me now...
Present
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes, could I ask for your opinion about this?
Sholmes:
......... You lure me to raise my languid head with the promise of some mental exaltation... ...yet in my morbid depression, I am confronted with the most mundane of problems.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Sholmes:
My mind finds greater stimulation in the unforgiving monotony of the floor than in your miserable offering.
Ryunosuke:
(...Always glad to help.)
Sholmes:
Oh, my head weighs heavy on my shoulders...
After clearing all Converse options with Herlock Sholmes and Iris Wilson:
MIIIAAOWWW!
Susato:
Oh! What was that?
Ryunosuke:
Wagahai?
*Clatter clatter* *Screeeeeech...*
Susato:
.........
Sholmes:
What was that?
Iris:
Oh no! Wagahai's tangled up in your violin!
Susato:
I think he thinks it's a toy!
Ryunosuke:
No! (What's he doing to it?!)
Susato:
Oh dear... Mr Sholmes's precious violin...
Sholes:
...Why should I care?
Ryunosuke:
What?
Sholmes:
I shouldn't be surprised... ...if the cat is a more accomplished musician than I now.
Susato:
...Mr Sholmes really is in poor spirits, isn't he?
Iris:
Well anyway, I'll put it back where it lives, shall I, Hurley?
Ryunosuke:
Out of the cat's reach, if possible. (Maybe we should assess the damage...)
Examine
"Violin"
Ryunosuke:
So this is the violin, is it?
Sholmes:
It's a Stradivarius. One of the finest violins in the world, made by the renowned Italian luthier, Antonio Stradivari.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I, I see... (It...doesn't really look like anything special to me.)
Sholmes:
I happened upon it covered in dust, languishing in a pawn shop down a nondescript back alley. The broker had no idea of its value, so I was able to purchase it for a mere fifty-five shillings.
Ryunosuke:
(...How honourable of you.)
Sholmes:
And, until today, it has been my faithful companion in every great Paganini-inspired performance I have made! I ask you, is there reason to live in a world devoid of music? To tolerate this blanched existence? ...No! There is none!
Susato:
......... Um, Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
What, dear madam, what?! My thoughts are preoccupied with fancies of release from this dull routine!
Susato:
Well, it's about the violin. It looks...very different to normal, don't you think?
Sholmes:
Hm?
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean, Miss Susato?
Iris:
Oh! Susie's right! Yes... The tone of the wood is completely different!
Susato:
And that's not all! I'm sure there was no crack here before!
Ryunosuke:
Wait! It's...not even the right size, is it?
Sholmes:
What's this...?
Susato:
......... I'm terribly sorry to have to tell you this, Mr Sholmes, but... ...that instrument isn't a violin at all.
Sholmes:
Then, what...?!
Susato:
I believe... ...it's an entirely different instrument, called a 'viola'!
Sholmes:
Wha...wha...wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Susato:
Oh, Mr Sholmes! Are you alright?
Sholmes:
You're right! You are quite right! This isn't my faithful Stradivarius! So what, pray, is this piece of stringed flotsam?!
Ryunosuke:
(Not your faithful performing partner, then?)
Iris:
Ah, I see what must have happened.
Ryunosuke:
You do, Iris?
Iris:
This is just a simple mix-up.
Ryunosuke:
(It sounds like Iris might be able to tell us exactly what's happened if we ask her.)
"Violin" (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
So this isn't actually your violin at all then, is it?
Sholmes:
It is nobody's 'violin', my dear fellow. It's a viola.
Ryunosuke:
(Poor Mr Sholmes. He won't even look up from the floor now.)
Susato:
Wagahai is over here with his hackles up, just waiting for a chance to pounce on it again.
Iris:
I'm starting to feel quite sorry for the beaten up little viola.
Iris Wilson
Mix-up (appears after examining "violin")
Ryunosuke:
What did you mean by a mix-up, Iris?
Iris:
Well, you see, this violin- Sorry, this viola, I mean... ...was at Windibank's until last week.
Susato:
At...at the pawnbroker's?
Ryunosuke:
Not Mr Sholmes's beloved musical partner!
Sholmes:
There is a proverb from the East with which you are no doubt familiar, my dear fellows: 'Always let a beloved child travel.'
Susato:
Yes, indeed.
Ryunosuke:
So you sent your beloved violin to the pawnbroker's in the hope that it would experience personal growth?
Susato:
Oh, what a wonderful idea!
Sholmes:
Last week I pawned my Great Analytiscope in order to release my precious instrument. But it would appear Mr Windibank mistakenly furnished me with this tawdry fiddle instead. But my ears cannot be deceived by the hollow timbre of this piece of timber!
Ryunosuke:
...No, but your every sense was deceived by the fact that it just had strings.
Sholmes:
Pshaw, a fine state of affairs this is! And why I always say, Mr Naruhodo: Never trust a pawnbroker! They will try to fiddle you every time!
Susato:
But earlier you told us that you could think of a pawnbrokery as 'an extremely secure vault'...
After examining "violin" and clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson:
Sholmes:
Come, Mr Naruhodo! Dilly-dallying will get you nowhere!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
Crunching your toast with that vacant aspect... Fressing your coffee so obtusely... Are you not a little embarrassed by your own conduct, considering the urgency with which we are faced?
Susato:
We must visit Mr Windibank's brokery at once! That's right, isn't it, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Precisely, Miss Susato. Without a moment's delay!
Ryunosuke:
But, but I haven't finished my bacon and eggs...
Sholmes:
My dear fellow! Surely you do not still intend... ...to crunch your bacon with an increasingly vacant aspect? To fress your egg ever more obtusely?
Ryunosuke:
Alright, alright, say no more! Let's go then.
Iris:
Don't worry, Runo, I'd be happy to heat it up for you again later.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, thank you, Iris. (As it happens, I am rather curious to see what a British pawnbroker's looks like.)

Any option
Ryunosuke:
Um, I was wondering, Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
This is no time for wondering, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Sholmes:
Tut tut, your furtive glance betrays you, my dear fellow. You stole a brief look at the remnants of the omelette over there, did you not?
Ryunosuke:
Ah...
Sholmes:
I must say, you astound me with your insatiable appetite.
Ryunosuke:
But, I really wasn't looking...
Sholmes:
Even as the words issue from your mouth, your eyes veritably devour the remaining rasher of bacon! You are quite true to form this morning, I see!
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, please! Try to remember the urgency of the matter at hand!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I, I know. We're all about to pay a visit to the pawnbroker's. I'm really not trying to delay us!
Sholmes:
And yet I would give odds of a thousand to one that within the next five seconds... ...your eyes will settle thirstily on the last few drops of coffee in the cup over there!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... Why does he have to deduce everything so correctly all of a sudden?)
Iris:
Hahaha! This is fun! Runo's eyes are as big as saucers!
Ryunosuke:
...Please can we go to the pawnbroker's now? Before I run out of safe places to look?
Iris:
Yes, I think that's an excellent idea!

Anything
Sholmes:
I must stop you there, Mr Naruhodo. Unofficial, I may be, but I am nevertheless a professional. I couldn't examine such a humdrum item... ...for anything less than five pounds.
Ryunosuke:
Oh. No, I didn't really want you to examine it. I just wanted to ask if-
Sholmes:
My dear fellow! As a professional consulting detective, I couldn't possibly venture an opinion... ...for anything less than five pounds.
Susato:
...Are you perhaps hoping to purchase a new telescope in the near future, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Indeed I am. As you know, it has long been an ambition of mine to discover a new star and name it for myself.
Ryunosuke:
...Because your earthly stardom isn't enough.

What to do
Susato:
Can it really be that we've been in Great Britain for two months already?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it's gone by in a flash, hasn't it?
Susato:
And what an English gentleman you've...
Ryunosuke:
...You trailed off there, Susato-san.
Susato:
I'm so sorry. When I thought it through, I realised it's not at all true, actually. I simply don't feel that any Britishness has really rubbed off on you.
Ryunosuke:
Nor you, to be honest.
Susato:
Well, well that's obviously because...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I know. Without a doubt, it's your kimono. It most certainly stands out.
Susato:
I do adore the attire of English ladies. It's quite delightful. But somehow...I just don't feel ready to abandon my Japanese dress just yet.
Ryunosuke:
(I wonder how Susato-san would look in Western clothes? That would be interesting to see.)

Examine
Pawnbrokery
Ryunosuke:
Look at all the different things in the window of this shop!
Susato:
Ah, that's Windibank's, the pawnbrokery.
Ryunosuke:
It looks much smarter than a pawnbroker's in Japan, doesn't it?
Susato:
Yes, you're right. I find pawnshops at home rather inapproachable, personally.
Ryunosuke:
It reminds me of tearfully parting with my favourite fountain pen. I felt so miserable.
Susato:
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger, Mr Naruhodo.
Sholmes' office
Ryunosuke:
It's already been two months since we started taking lodgings here above Mr Sholmes's office. (I still can't quite believe it. I never expected things would turn out like this.)
Susato:
Oh, I know! To actually be sharing accommodation with the world's greatest detective! If I ever find myself before a court of law now, I will have not one regret!
Ryunosuke:
I...don't know what you're talking about. But I'd be happy to defend you, of course.
15th April
Windibank's Pawnbrokery
Ryunosuke:
So this...is a British pawnbrokery...
Susato:
Oh my! There are all sorts of tools and contraptions in here that I've never laid eyes on before!
Ryunosuke:
(Ah, Susato-san...and that spark of wonder in your eyes. You can't wait to scour the shelves, can you?) I get the impression you enjoy places like this?
Susato:
Oh yes! I don't know why, but seeing such a lot of things I don't understand is a real thrill for me!
Sholmes:
My dear fellows...let us not forget why we are here.
Susato:
Oh! Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
We are calling on matters of business, not pleasure.
Ryunosuke:
(And clearly Mr Sholmes means business, too, judging from the spark of fury in HIS eyes.)
Windibank:
Ah, Mr Sholmes, sir! Welcome back!
Sholmes:
...Did you hear that brazen welcome?
Ryunosuke:
Well, yes. We are potential customers, after all.
Sholmes:
We are disgruntled customers, Mr Naruhodo. And it's time to inform Mr Windibank of our ire. Come! The fight is afoot!

Anything
Sholmes:
What are you doing, my dear fellows? We are not here to browse for interesting curios. We have come to teach this broker a lesson!
Susato:
Oh, but there are just so many fascinating items...
Ryunosuke:
It looks as though we'll have to talk to Mr Windibank first before you can explore in here, Miss Susato.

Violin
Sholmes:
Naturally, you will recall this...which I retrieved from you some days ago.
Windibank:
Yeees.
Sholmes:
This second-rate fiddle is not my faithful instrument, Mr Windibank! The colour of the wood is different! It has holes in it! It's not even the same size!
Susato:
A wonderful summary of our observations, Mr Sholmes.
Windibank:
......... I'm, I'm sooo very sorry, sir! How utterly unforgivable of me! An inexcusable mistake for a pawnbroker! There is only one way to make amends... I shall have to take my own life!
Sholmes:
......... I...don't think that will be necessary, do you?
Windibank:
If I may just say one thing, before I...pop off...
Sholmes:
Ah. Yes?
Windibank:
It was you, sir, Mr Sholmes, who took it upon himself to remove the item the other day...I believe...
Sholmes:
Sorry?
Windibank:
As I recall, I entered the storeroom to fetch your violin, when I heard, 'Ah, here it is!'
Sholmes:
You did?
Windibank:
And when I turned to controvert you, you had taken the viola and left, sir.
Sholmes:
.........
Windibank:
However! There can be no doubt that the blame lies firmly at my own door for allowing you to leave. So I shall not grumble or grouse any longer. May this guilt die with me!
Sholmes:
No no no! Stop, my dear fellow! The fault is mine!
Windibank:
......... Phew.
Susato:
...It would appear that the 'fight' is over.
Sholmes:
I do humbly apologise, Mr Windibank. Evidently my questionable disposition precipitated this tragedy.
Windibank:
Well, you wouldn't be Mr Herlock Sholmes without that... questionable disposition now, would you?
Sholmes:
Haha, I do believe you may be right, sir. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
Ryunosuke:
...It's either laugh or cry, I suppose.
Windibank:
You are, it must be said, one of my more challenging customers. I needn't remind you of the peculiar  collection of items you've brought through my door in the past.
Susato:
Oh? Peculiar items?
Windibank:
In the extreme, ma'am. For example... ...the unpublished manuscript of an eponymous work. 'The Novels of Herlock Sholmes' or some such.
Susato:
Oh my! A new, full-fledged novel?! And, unpublished?! A story I have yet to read, you mean?!
Windibank:
AAAAAAGH! Forgive me!
Susato:
Wait! Before you die! You must tell me more!
Unpublished story (appears after "Violin")
Susato:
I must know more! Tell me everything!
Ryunosuke:
(Wow, Susato-san is really fired up now.)
Susato:
Is there really an, an unpublished story...under this very roof?!
Windibank:
Well, one day the gentleman here brought in an old metal chest, you see.
Sholmes:
I should like to entrust this to your care for a while, Mr Windibank.
Windibank:
Hm...for a chest like that...one shilling, sir. Not a farthing more.
Sholmes:
It houses something of very great value indeed. The latest manuscript...recounting the adventures of one Mr Herlock Sholmes!
Windibank:
I beg your pardon?! A manuscript?! You wish to deposit a manuscript?
Sholmes:
Indeed I do. For I am confident it will be quite safe here.
Windibank:
And that was that. As such, Mr Sholmes's latest tale of otherworldly mystery lies dormant in my storeroom.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes! Is that really true?!
Sholmes:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(...Do I sense that someone doesn't want to talk about this?)
Sholmes:
I continue to pay your fee, do I not? Then kindly continue to store my belongings...securely.
Windibank:
Of course, sir, of course! They're safe and sound with me, I assure you. ...On my life!
Ryunosuke:
(This is all very strange...)
Pawnbrokery
Ryunosuke:
I wonder, could I ask you something?
Windibank:
Ah, a gentleman from the East, I see. Yes, that sable suit... I suppose I could offer you sixpence for it. Without wishing to offend, the tone is somewhat...dull. 
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Windibank:
Ah-ha! But for your splendid attire, ma'am...five guineas, no less! The colours are exquisite! The design, exotic! Eastern artistry at its finest, may I say!
Susato:
Oh my! Five guineas, you say? How interesting!
Ryunosuke:
(...Why do I feel as though I've suffered some sort of defeat here?) Actually, I was hoping to ask you about your business. I've heard it said that pawnbrokeries are used rather like banks here in London.
Windibank:
Yes, sir, indeed. Many of my customers utilise the establishment as you describe. I appraise their items, and offer them a proportionate loan and two months of secure stowage. If, in that time, they repay the original sum to me plus the agreed interest, their items are happily returned.
Susato:
But what happens if they don't pay you the money?
Windibank:
Then the items are offered for sale in my shop. As you can see on the shelves behind me.
Susato:
So you never sell items before the two months has passed, then?
Windibank:
That's right, ma'am, that's right! Which means some considerable responsibility rests on my shoulders. Should a customer's precious belongings be lost, the only recompense is for me to end it all!
Sholmes:
The very idea, Mr Windibank, is an absurdity. One should never talk of one's demise so casually.
Ryunosuke:
(...Says the man who was telling us all it was a good day to die only this morning.)
Sholmes:
And let us not forget that I have already helped you take measures to ensure such a tragedy never occurs.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, what sort of measures?
Sholmes:
I engineered a simple device, which Mr Windibank has installed here in his shop. I call it...the Red-Handed Recorder! Is that not so, Mr Windibank?
Windibank:
...Haaahhh.
Ryunosuke:
(What was that deep sigh about?)
Red-Handed Recorder (appears after "Pawnbrokery")
Ryunosuke:
What on earth is a 'Red-Handed Recorder'?
Sholmes:
Use your eyes, my dear fellow. There are two just below the ceiling.
Susato:
I...can see what appears to be a camera attached to some sort of timing device.
Sholmes:
Very astute! It is indeed a camera, furnished with some hundred pieces of celluloid film. And every thirty minutes precisely, the camera automatically records the appearance of the shop.
Windibank:
Here, I have an example I can show you...
Sholmes:
Ah yes, a print from the camera set to record the activity at the shop counter. I developed a special type of film so sensitive, it produces a crystal-clear image even in darkness.
Ryunosuke:
Really? That's...extraordinary.
Susato:
Yes, you can clearly see the counter and the door behind it, look.
Sholmes:
So you see, were someone to enter the premises with ill intent, his identity would be summarily exposed.
Susato:
But...did you not say that the photographic prints were taken at thirty-minute intervals?
Sholmes:
Indeed, as you say, my dear madam.
Susato:
Then what if the incident were to occur in between times?
Sholmes:
One could only say...that would be a cruel twist of fate!
Windibank:
Hmmm... I must confess your devices have been giving me some cause for distress of late.
Sholmes:
I beg your pardon, Mr Windibank? Surely they are anything but distressing. Reassuring is the word!
Windibank:
It's the cost of the film, sir. You most graciously placed not one, but two cameras in my shop, after all. Which means I must pay for nigh on one hundred utterly useless prints every single day. I'm afraid the cost of the film will break me before I'm very much older.
Sholmes:
......... Nevertheless, a small price to pay to ensure the safety of my preferred pawnbrokery, no? My dear fellows! We verge on an age where safety and security come at a price.
Windibank:
Oh! Heaven help us!
Present
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Um, Mr Windibank, about this...
Windibank:
Hm, let me see... I'll give you tuppence for it.
Ryunosuke:
No no! I don't want to pawn it!
After clearing all Converse options:
Windibank:
Now then, Mr Sholmes, allow me to return your precious violin.
Sholmes:
Ah, the very thing! Thank you, Mr Windibank.
Windibank:
Perhaps this might mark the end of the peculiar items you try to pop, hm? Because if anything were to happen to one of them... ...this would be the only answer!
Ryunosuke:
Um, I really think you ought to stop waving that gun around. Someone could get hurt.
Windibank:
Fear not!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Windibank:
I've only loaded a single bullet, so no one but myself could possibly be harmed!
Ryunosuke:
(That's...not really what I meant.)
Sholmes:
Good day to you then, Mr Windibank.
Windibank:
It's been a pleasure as always, Mr Sholmes!
Susato:
So, Mr Naruhodo! Now we can explore at last!
Examine
Counter
Susato:
Look at that enormous ledger open on the counter there.
Sholmes:
Mr Windibank is, if nothing else, very particular about recording the items he accepts.
Ryunosuke:
He'd have to be. Otherwise he'd get himself into all sorts of trouble. (Which might explain the thing that catches my eye far more than the ledger... This revolver here.)
Sholmes:
Do not entertain even a single thought of pilfering an article herein, my dear fellow.
Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Sholmes:
I assure you, Mr Windibank would not hesitate to draw that weapon with a speed belying his portly size.
Susato:
Oh! You, you don't mean he'd...
Sholmes:
...Blow his brains out? Indeed. In recompense for his blunder.
Susato:
......... Oh my... But in any case, of course we would never do such a thing! How could you even suggest it?
Curtain or side door
Ryunosuke:
(There seems to be a little door hidden behind that curtain there.)
Sholmes:
That leads to the storage room. Where Mr Windibank keeps articles that are currently in pawn.
Susato:
Ah, I see.
Sholmes:
There's nothing of particular interest inside. I certainly wouldn't recommend any larcenous activity.
Ryunosuke:
Recommended or not, it's not something I tend to do.
Sholmes:
There is but one key. And Mr Windibank keeps it in his pocket at all times. Before he sleeps, he places it into a small pot, which he slides under his pillow.
Windibank:
How, how on earth do you know about that, Mr Sholmes?!
Sholmes:
I am a detective, sir. It is my business to know what others do not. I am frequently assailed by information that I neither care for, nor wish to retain.
Susato:
Mr Sholmes...you are a wonder!
Ryunosuke:
(...And the prime suspect if this pawnbrokery is ever burgled.)
Brown machine on left
Susato:
Look at this! What could this lovely, big, shiny box be?
Sholmes:
That, my dear madam, is a music box. Surely you have such things in your own country?
Susato:
Oh my! Yes, but I've certainly never seen one so large before!
Sholmes:
Shall we listen a while?
Susato:
Ah...what a sublime sound... It's like the music of angels.
Ryunosuke:
I've never heard anything like it before in my life.
Sholmes:
This particular specimen is of the larger variety, commonly found in public houses and restaurants. There is a metal disk inside on which the notes to be played are recorded. Simply by replacing the disk with another, any music you care to imagine can be played.
Susato:
My goodness! What a simply delightful machine!
Sholmes:
Indeed. Though their popularity has waned recently with the development of the gramophone, of course.
Susato:
Haaah... Science and technology advance at such an overwhelming pace...
Shelves
Susato:
What an assortment of things there are on these shelves here. Crockery, footwear, clocks and watches... Almost anything you care to imagine!
Sholmes:
Those are forfeited items, offered for sale by the pawnbroker.
Ryunosuke:
What does that really mean, though?
Sholmes:
When you pawn - or colloquially 'pop' - an item, the broker loans you money against its worth. He stores the item for an agreed period of time, after which the loan must be repaid. If not... ...he is free to display it in his shop for sale, at a price of his choosing.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes. Now you've explained it, I'm noticing little price tags on everything.
Sholmes:
Of course, simply by paying the agreed interest on the loan, one can extend the period of safekeeping. So you may pawn that black garb of yours without fear, my dear fellow.
Ryunosuke:
My treasured university uniform? Never! It embodies my student spirit!
Brown machine on right
Susato:
Now what do you suppose this rather enormous machine does?
Ryunosuke:
It...seems to have two little windows for looking through.
Sholmes:
Allow me to enlighten you, my dear fellows. What you are looking at is a stereoscope.
Susato:
A stereosc... Fascinating!
Sholmes:
It is aptly named, I assure you. Look through the eyepieces and see for yourself.
Susato:
Oh, I should be delighted to! Excuse me a moment, while I just have a look...
Sholmes:
Just before you do, there is something I should point out. My dear fellows... In order to see the image properly - stereoscopically, as it were - you will need to be cross-eyed. However, if that is beyond you, it is of little consequence today.
Susato:
Alright then, I'm going to try it. AAAAAAAAAH!!! Mr Naruhodo! You must see! At once!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, al-alright then... So, I need to be cross-eyed. Like I'm trying to look at my own nose... ...What the...?! I, I don't believe it! It's just a photographic print, but...it seems like you could reach out and touch it!
Sholmes:
Yes, the sense of depth is startling, is it not? Stereoscopes are one of London's many fads. They are often found in little stalls in the park. People queue for hours to see them.
Susato:
Why?! Why are people meddling with such black magic?!
Sholmes:
It is no magic, my dear madam. It is...well... ...far too complicated to explain at present. We shall save this lesson for another day.
Susato:
Oh...
Machine in foreground
Susato:
Look at this! Whatever could it be used for?
Ryunosuke:
Um... Erm... I have no idea.
Susato:
...Ah. There's a small catch just here, look.
Ryunosuke:
......... ...We're going to open it, aren't we?
Susato:
Oh my! That's amazing! It has some sort of spring-loaded mechanism!
Ryunosuke:
(...Which we'll never manage to put back to the way it was before.)
Sholmes:
Hm? What are you two doing?
Ryunosuke:
What? Us? Nothing! No no, nothing at all! (Whatever this device is, it seems to have a pair of little windows to look through. I feel as though I've seen something rather similar to this elsewhere...)
Globes outside door
Susato:
Three globes of gold... Is that some sort of charm?
Sholmes:
Dear me, have you not seen that sign before?
Ryunosuke:
No, never.
Sholmes:
The three golden balls are, in Great Britain at least, the universal sign of a pawnbrokery. There are more than seven hundred such establishments in the capital, all showing this same sign.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see.
Sholmes:
Haah... I had not imagined your ignorance was so profound.
Susato:
Oh... Well, what is the significance of the three golden balls then? Does it have some special meaning?
Sholmes:
......... That is entirely unimportant here, dear madam. Irrelevant, even.
Ryunosuke:
(...You mean you don't know.)
Calendar
Ryunosuke:
That's not a calendar you could easily miss, is it? (15th April... Today's date.)
Windibank:
Yes, that's not for sale, I must point out. It is an Eastern-style page-a-day calendar. Every night at midnight, I tear off the front page to reveal the following day's date.
Sholmes:
The perfect calendar for a tearaway fellow such as yourself, Mr Windibank.
Ryunosuke:
(...And who was it who walked out of here with the wrong violin before?)
Windibank:
Well, when the agreed storage period has passed without repayment, articles are forfeited, you see. So I have to keep a close eye on the date. It's something of a pawnbroker's obsession, you might say.
Susato:
Oh yes. I can see you're very dedicated to your job.
After examining brown machine on left, shelves, brown machine on right, machine in foreground, and calendar:
???:
Wot?! Only tuppence for it? That ain't fair, and you know it!
???:
That article is barely worth a penny, miss. I cannot offer more.
Ryunosuke:
(Sounds like there's an argument brewing over by the counter.)
???:
Come on, that can't be right! 'Ave you even 'ad a proper butcher's at it?
???:
I've seen all I need to see, young girl!
Ryunosuke:
Wait, don't we know...? (I'm sure I recognise her.)
Susato:
Oh! Yes! It's the young lady...from Mr McGilded's trial two months ago!
McGilded:
Her name is Gina Lestrade, My Lord. She's a chancer. Earns her crust among large crowds, relievin' people of their purses. What's commonly called a pickpocket.
Gina:
......... Gordon Bennett! You lot!
Susato:
Hello, Miss Lestrade. I hope you've been well.
Gina:
Eh?! Wot, you remember me then, do ya?
Ryunosuke:
Well, I remember being completely surrounded by smoke, that's for sure.
Gina:
So...wot are you doin' in 'ere? Down and out, like the rest of us? Nuffin' to eat? Come to pop that black weasel - sorry, 'coat' - 'ave ya?
Ryunosuke:
(...What is it about this black uniform that makes everyone comment on it?)
Sholmes:
Ah, good day. Unless I'm much mistaken... ...you would be the young pickpocket who stole our experimental smoke grenade launcher.
Gina:
Agh! Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
So...you have something of value to pawn, do you? Allow me to see the article, and I shall negotiate with Mr Windibank on your behalf.
Gina:
Pull the other one! I don't need no 'elp from some stuck-up dee! Get outta my business! Go on, or I'll make trouble for ya!
Sholmes:
As you wish, Miss Lestrade. I will happily remove myself from your presence.
Ryunosuke:
(He's really done it. He's gone.)
Windibank:
I'm sorry, but as I said, there really is no room for negotiation here.
Ryunosuke:
(What is that thing he has in his hand? Some kind of metal disk?)
Gina:
And you! Go on! Leave me alone!
Susato:
Oh, Miss Lestrade, just pretend we aren't here. We shan't be offended in the slightest.
Gina:
.........
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san can really stand her ground when she wants to.)
Gina:
Wotever...
Examine
Pop Windibank
Miss Lestrade's disk
Susato:
Mr Windibank, what exactly is this metal disk that Miss Lestrade has brought in? It seems to have hundreds of tiny little bumps on its surface...
Windibank:
Ah, this is a music disk, you see. For use inside a music box.
Ryunosuke:
In a music box?
Gina:
Wot, you don't even know wot a music box is? Tsk, you Eastern lot ain't too savvy, eh?
Ryunosuke:
...I know what a music box is. I've just never seen one of these disks before.
Windibank:
The small protrusions on the metal disk encode the tune to be played by the music box. You simply insert the disk and set the machine going, and beautiful music plays!
Susato:
It's so incredible! Tell us, what tune is on this disk?
Windibank:
Well...I'm afraid I couldn't tell you that. There are so many different types of music box, you see. British-made, German, Swiss... I have no way of knowing which particular machine this disk was made for.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, I see.
Windibank:
And that's it in a nutshell. I wouldn't have any customers for an item like this, even if the young lady forfeited it. Really I'm already offering more than I should at a penny.
Gina:
That's a packet o' lies! 'E told me, 'e did! 'E said it was...well... .........
Ryunosuke:
'He'? Who?
Gina:
Never you mind! It just ain't right, that's all! That disk's worth good money, I know it is!
Windibank:
Well then...you'll have to try your luck at another pawnbroker's, won't you?
Gina:
Argh!
Gina Lestrade
Windibank:
She's been in before, of course, this little tatterdemalion.
Ryunosuke:
I see.
Windibank:
And brought some dubious article or other with her every single time, I might add.
Gina:
Dubious? Wot are you tryin' to say? I'm an 'onest customer, me!
Ryunosuke:
So...is there something dubious about the disk she brought in today?
Windibank:
Well, if only it were that simple.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? What do you mean?
Windibank:
What she actually brought in was a storage ticket.
Susato:
Ah, a storage ticket. So... ...Miss Lestrade has actually come to redeem an article from you today, is that right?
Gina:
Yeah, that's right. ...A girl like me 'as a lot of stuff wot needs storin'...
Ryunosuke:
(Alright, yes, that's definitely dubious...)
Windibank:
The article in question would have been forfeited at midnight tonight. But as she gave me the ticket for it, and repaid both the loan and the interest... ...I was obliged to return the article to her.
Susato:
But what was the article? Do tell us, Mr Windibank.
Windibank:
The little scamp is wearing it, ma'am. It's the overcoat that she redeemed.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Gina:
Wot?! Wot's wrong wiv that? It fits, don't it? I mean, it's mine, so...'course it does!
Susato:
So what about the disk, then? How does that come into all this?
Windibank:
Ah, the disk is something else. A new article to pawn, if the girl and I can agree a price.
New article to pawn (appears after "Gina Lestrade")
Ryunosuke:
I'm confused. I thought you said that Miss Lestrade brought in a storage ticket today.
Windibank:
It's really quite simple. Yes, the child brought me a storage ticket and the money owed on it, as you say.
Ryunosuke:
For this heavy, black coat, which you returned to her care, as I'd understood it.
Windibank:
That's right, yes. And rather unsurprisingly, as soon as the little ragamuffin put the thing on... ...she went rifling through the pockets.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, you mean...?
Gina:
Wot?! Don't know it's rude to stare at a lady?
Susato:
Ah, I see! So it came from the pocket of the overcoat, did it?
Windibank:
If you mean this disk, then yes, exactly, ma'am.
Susato:
And she immediately tried to pawn it...
Ryunosuke:
For quite a high price as well... (This is all rather suspicious, I think.)
Gina:
Give it up! I'm just tryin' to pawn somefin' like anyone else would.
Susato:
Miss Lestrade, may I ask who deposited the overcoat here in the first place?
Gina:
Um...well...me...
Ryunosuke:
It...doesn't really appear to be your size.
Gina:
Me old man! It's me old man's, ain't it?
Susato:
Is it...Miss Lestrade?
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, this is definitely all rather suspicious...)
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Look at Mr Windibank, watching diligently over his shop. There are still so many things I'm curious about.
Susato:
I don't believe this is a time for browsing, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
(We should probably see whether that argument's been resolved yet, I suppose.)

Pawnbroker's customer
Ryunosuke:
Somehow...I didn't really think you were the sort of person who'd use a pawnbroker, Miss Lestrade.
Gina:
Yeah, well I am, alright? I'm a Londoner, just like everyone else. That a problem, is it?
Ryunosuke:
No no, not at all. It's just that, well...
Gina:
Oh, I get it! I know wot you're thinkin'! 'That thing prob'ly don't even belong to 'er. Prob'ly got it on the dive, didn't she?' Yeah, I can see it written all over yer chevy chase!
Ryunosuke:
Well...I, I might have been thinking something along those lines.
Susato:
You're not going to deny it, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Alright then, I'm just going to come out and ask you straight: Do you pawn things that you steal from other people?
Gina:
Well, um... I dunno 'ow best to answer that, really. Erm... S'pose. Sometimes.
Susato:
You're not going to deny it either, Miss Lestrade?
Gina:
But not this time, alright! I swear! That thing belongs to me!
Ryunosuke:
(The disk that Mr Windibank is holding... Perhaps we should see what he has to say about all this.)

Ryunosuke:
Would you have a look at...erm... That's strange...(Where's my armband gone?)
Gina:
Wot's the problem? Somefin' wrong? Don't s'pose... ...yer lookin' for this?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! But, but how?! And when?! And how again?!
Gina:
I got a talent for it, 'aven't I? Divin'.
Ryunosuke:

Oh yes, Japan. I've heard talk of the place. Its inhabitants live on some fiery, brown-coloured soup, dressed up with exotic spices.

Perhaps. Anyway, if you are a gentleman, sir... ...you offer your own name first, before enquiring after the name of another.

The gentleman's accusation
Susato:
Miss Lestrade, is what the gentleman is saying-
Gina:
Wot d'you think? It's all lies, ain't it? Obviously! I swear on my life, I ain't never laid eyes on that dandy before.
Windibank:
Let's hear it now, you little ragamuffin... You stole it, didn't you? That ticket you brought in here just now.
Gina:
No! I swear it! I swear to God!
???/Benedict:
It was barely an hour ago. I was walking along the street, minding my own business... ...when this little gutterling ran into me. I knew at once what had happened. 'I've been robbed yet again,' I thought to myself. Those wretched pickpockets!
Ryunosuke:
'Yet again'?
???/Benedict:
Oh yes. As you can see, I am a man of impeccable style. This isn't the first time that I've been targeted by these back slum scoundrels. Now then, relinquish my overcoat!
Gina:
Grrr...
Windibank:
Come along now, Miss Lestrade. Give the good gentleman his coat back. If you're going to cause trouble, I shall have no choice but to call the police.
Gina:
'Old on! Why's everyone think it's me? Just look at this dandy cove! And you think I'm the dodgy one?!
Windibank:
I'm sorry, but no one's going to believe you.
Gina:
Well...wot about evidence? Yeah! Where's yer evidence that I've stolen somefin', eh? Come on, let's see it!
???/Benedict:
Oh, I have evidence, naturally.
Gina:
You wot?!
Evidence (appears after "The gentleman's accusation")
Ryunosuke:
Evidence that the article Miss Lestrade redeemed actually belongs to this gentleman...
Susato:
Of course! We need only consult Mr Windibank's ledger to know the truth! We'll be able to look up the name of the person who deposited the article in the first place.
Ryunosuke:
Yes! Brilliant!
Windibank:
I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid that won't be possible.
Susato:
Oh!
Windibank:
I never ask customers' names. That's a strict policy of mine.
Ryunosuke:
But...why not?
Windibank:
Well now...as you can imagine, some of my customers have...circumstances to consider. A great many of them prefer to maintain their anonymity.
Susato:
Yes, I see... But then how can you know if an article belongs to the person asking to redeem it?
Windibank:
Oh, it's quite simple! Good sir... ...might I trouble you for the watchword associated with the article in question?
???/Benedict:
Of course. It's... 'Professor'.
Windibank:
Yes, that's right. ...And all the evidence we need. This gentleman is the rightful owner of the article. Without doubt.
Ryunosuke:
A watchword? Interesting...
Watchwords (appears after "Evidence")
Ryunosuke:
So...about these watchwords, Mr Windibank...
Windibank:
As I just explained... ...I never ask customers' names when they deposit items with me. There are many reasons why certain customers would like to keep their activities secret.
Ryunosuke:
(That wasn't exactly a subtle glance at Mr Sholmes now, was it?)
Susato:
Great detectives have no dark secrets! None at all!
Windibank:
Yes, well... Anyway, that's why I always ask for a watchword whenever I accept a new article. In many ways, it's like the secret combination of numbers used to unlock a vault. The date of deposit, a description and a watchword uniquely identify each item. And of course then I give the storage ticket to the customer. When someone comes to redeem something, I ask for the ticket and the watchword.
Ryunosuke:
And if that someone tells you the correct watchword, you return the article?
Windibank:
That's right, sir, yes. Just as soon as the requisite fee is paid.
???/Benedict:
And I have supplied you with the information you require already. But for the avoidance of doubt: The article in question is an overcoat. Deposited two months ago, on 15th February. With a watchword of...'Professor'.
Windibank:
All perfectly correct information, sir.
Gina:
But, but 'ow...?
???/Benedict:
Really, this is beyond a joke now. There is no further room for doubt.
Gina:
Ugh...

Windibank:
But of course, sir. Here is the disk for you.

Windibank:
Pardon, sir?
Benedict:
I was expecting another. Er, that is...I deposited another.
Ryunosuke:

Windibank:
Oh, um... Oh dear. I regret to inform you, sir, that what was deposited with me was merely the overcoat. The disk happened to be in one of the pockets, but I was completely unaware of it until now.
Benedict:
So, gutterling... You're hiding more of what's rightfully mine, are you?
Gina:
Says who, eh? I don't know nuffin' about it!
Benedict:
......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style.
Gina:
Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine!
Benedict:
Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal!
Susato:
Oh my! Yes! There's blood on the disk!

The music box disc has been entered into the Court Record.
Benedict:
You there! In the black livery! Hand that disk to me at once, please.
Examine evidence
Music Box Disk
Bloodstain
Ryunosuke:
Look at all the little bumps on the disk. They're so tiny.
Susato:
Yes. The protrusions are called pins, and they pluck the teeth of the comb to make notes. And just on the edge, there's a small amount of blood.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the blood of the mysterious Mr Eggert Benedict.
Susato:
When Miss Lestrade tried to grab the disk from him, the pins scratched his fingers, it seems. Like when you're gating some daikon radish and accidently catch your finger.
Ryunosuke:
(Ouch! Just thinking about it hurts! And puts me off eating radish...)
Note on back
Susato:
Oh, there's a little scrap of paper stuck onto the reverse side of the disk, look. And a scribbled word or two. It looks like somebody's name. ......... 'For McGilded'...
Ryunosuke:
Mc-McGilded? It couldn't be...?
Susato:
But it is, Mr Naruhodo! A name I shall never forget for as long as I live!
Ryunosuke:
(But why? Why is his name on this?)
The music box disk's information has been updated in the Court Record.
Note on back (subsequent times)
Susato:
'For McGilded'... The surname of the man whose innocence you secured in the trial two months ago, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. A trial I'll never forget. (Not least because of the tragic accident that followed it in which McGilded was killed.) But why would his name be on this music box disk?
Susato:
I'm afraid I have absolutely no idea. But one thing seems certain... ...this surely cannot be a simple coincidence.

No! Don't! He's lyin'! Grown-ups are all liars!

Ryunosuke:
Erm...Mr Sholmes... ...what are you examining with such keen interest there? As you enjoy a bar of caramel, I see.
Sholmes:
......... So... ...you've found me at last...Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
After that young pickpocket sent me on my way, I was forced to lurk in the shadows. Cruelly ostracised, as the rest of you partook in the jovial atmosphere of fellowship. I had nothing to occupy my mind, but was too ashamed to let society see what my downfall had done to me. So feigning mock interest, I pretended to examine the tedious trinkets in this desolate place. ...Whilst, as you shrewdly observed, gnawing on the only friend I have left: this seven per cent solution of caramel. Pray, do you claim to understand the depths of my despair, Mr Naruhodo? But how could you?! I was so lonely... So desperately lonely...
Ryunosuke:
Then...why on earth didn't you rejoin the conversation? Things have gone from bad to worse here, you know!
Sholmes:
Yes...I overheard much of your conversation. Or rather...in my craving for human contact, my ears devoured every word that was uttered!
Ryunosuke:
...You really were sad, weren't you?
Susato:
Poor Mr Sholmes. I feel simply awful for you.
Sholmes:
It would seem... ...that my inferences are correct.
Susato:
Oh! ...Surely you're not about to tell us... ...that you've solved the entire case once again?!
Sholmes:
My dear madam, sometimes I wonder... Were my genius for deduction to be commoditised... ...how much could I pawn it for?
Ryunosuke:
(It seems Mr Sholmes has had another of his flashes of inspiration. But who knows if it will help to resolve the situation between Miss Lestrade and the mysterious gentleman? What's the right thing to do here...?)
Listen to the deduction
Leads to:
"Well, Miss Lestrade...it would appear you find yourself in something of a predicament."

Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! What are you saying? The great detective has made one of his great deductions! He's sure to cut straight to the heart of the matter!
Ryunosuke:
That's what I'm worried about! We don't need any more cuts around here!
Sholmes:
Dear me. You seem decidedly agitated. Clearly I shall have to take the reins.
Susato:
Yes! Please do, Mr Sholmes!
Ryunosuke:
(It looks like we're going to hear this deduction whether I like it or not...)
Leads to:
"Well, Miss Lestrade...it would appear you find yourself in something of a predicament."
Sholmes:
Well, Miss Lestrade...it would appear you find yourself in something of a predicament.

Tsk! Where the blue blazes 'ave you been, eh?

Benedict:
And who, pray tell, are you?
Sholmes:
......... Mr Eggert Benedict... ...you have, in my eyes, a veritably encyclopaedic array of curiosities about your person. Nevertheless, there are two immovable conclusions I have drawn.
Benedict:
I beg your pardon?
Sholmes:
The first is this: The true reason for your visit to this pawnbrokery today is something you have not yet revealed.
Benedict:
...!
Sholmes:
And the second is this: A considerable crime is in contemplation. One you will orchestrate, with intent to steal a vast sum of money. Well, Mr Benedict? What say you to my deductions?
Benedict:
How...!
Ryunosuke:
(He's turned as white as a hard-boiled egg!)
Susato:
It would seem that once again...Mr Sholmes has made a flawless deduction!
Benedict:
Just who do you think you are, sir?
Sholmes:
Ah yes, as I hoped... That is precisely the pained expression I was looking for. So...shall we begin? The time has come for yet another Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!
The Great DeductionThe game is afoot!
Topic 1
Mystery Man's Aim
Sholmes:
First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! The piece of paper in your hand is a 'staff wanted' advertisement from this very shop. Yet even the most unobservant would soon realise that a man of your appearance has no need of such employ. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions.
Benedict:
...!
Sholmes:
The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction.
Benedict:
What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years!
Sholmes:
The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. The end of any walking cane would be terminated with a metal ferrule to protect the wooden tip. And yet detailed analysis shows the wooden tip of this stick to be utterly bare. Therefore...there is only one conclusion: The rod that you hold in your hand, which appears to be a walking cane... ...is in fact no cane at all!
Benedict:
...!
Sholmes:
You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong?
Benedict:
I... Well, I...
Sholmes:
And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear?
Benedict:
.........
Sholmes:
Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. From the moment I saw it, my suspicions were aroused. 'What walking cane demands such a stout handle?' mused I.
Benedict:
.........
Sholmes:
But of course, as I said, this is no walking cane. No, that rod... ...is the broken handle of a shovel!
Benedict:
Wha...? Are you insane?!
Sholmes:
And now, having determined this undeniable truth, the conclusion is clear. Your true motive for coming here... ...was to take employment at this establishment in order to excavate the ground beneath the premises! What a calculated crime you have conceived, sir. A wickedly calculated crime.
Topic 1
Mystery Man's Aim
Conclusion
To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery
Topic 2
Great Crime
Sholmes:
Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning.
Benedict:
This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, intend to excavate the ground beneath this pawnbrokery with a broken shovel? What on earth do you propose I could expect to find there? Some long-forgotten treasure, I suppose? Save for such a fanciful theory, what possible reason could I have to do as you say?
Sholmes:
Oh, but there is ample reason... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped.
Benedict:
What?
Sholmes:
Let us consider what would motivate a man to infiltrate a shop such as this and covertly dig beneath its floor... The answer is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. This letter gives notice of public works to be carried out in the local area. And according to the enclosed plan of the upcoming sewerage works... ...beneath this shop runs a sewer that adjoins another, one that runs under the bank on the opposite side of the road.
Benedict:
This madness has entered the sewers now, has it?!
Sholmes:
By excavating the ground beneath our feet, you would gain access to the waterway... ...that flows in very close proximity to the great vault of the financial institution opposite.
Benedict:
What are you...?
Sholmes:
In summary, sir... ...you devised a master plan to pull off an elaborate bank robbery by dint of the underground tunnels!
Benedict:
M... Master plan?!
Sholmes:
Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... With what plunder did the thief hope to make off from the underground vault of the bank?
Benedict:
Are you quite serious?
Sholmes:
Having consulted with Scotland Yard some days ago, I happen to know the answer. But naturally, the answer is no secret to you, is it, Mr Benedict?
Benedict:
I have no idea what you're talking about!
Sholmes:
Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know.
Benedict:
A postcard of the Great Exhibition? I'm afraid you've quite lost me.
Sholmes:
Currently in the final stages of preparation, the Great Exhibition will soon be underway. And the government has provided extra funds to complete its centrepiece, the Crystal Tower. Funds that currently sit in the vault of the bank on the other side of this road!
Benedict:
Pardon?
Sholmes:
Yes, the considerable crime you have been contemplating... ...is the theft of that which sits in the vault of that bank, the special reserve funds for the Great Exhibition! ...Of course, that is top-secret police information. So keep it under your hat, please.
Topic 2
Great Crime
Conclusion
To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds
Sholmes:
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this pawnbroking puzzle!
Ryunosuke:
Um...Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
Well, Mr Naruhodo? An impressively upbeat deduction for a detective racked with loneliness, would you not agree?
Ryunosuke:
Was it true what you said about the bank over the road and what it has in its vault?
Sholmes:
Indeed. Though few know of its existence. It is one of the government's most closely guarded secrets. Gregson told me, in the strictest confidence.
Susato:
But you just announced it to everyone here. Rather loudly, in fact.
Sholmes:
...Ah.
Ryunosuke:
And if it's such a big secret... ...how would Mr Benedict have come to find out about it?
Sholmes:
There can be but one explanation for that. Clearly it is because the man is a criminal!
Susato:
But what if he didn't know anything about the money in the vault? If he is a criminal, as you said... ...then buying a brand new shovel is sure to be the first thing he does now that you've revealed the secret.
Sholmes:
...Oh.
Ryunosuke:
Or if he doesn't... ...maybe Mr Windibank will. He already has plenty of shovels here, after all.
Windibank:
Oh my life! I assure you I'm not so unscrupulous!
Sholmes:
Hm, well... Hopefully this has taught you a valuable lesson. Sensitive information must be handled with the utmost of care. One can never be sure that someone privy to secrets won't disclose them. And once the word is out, it's out.
Ryunosuke:
...Perhaps I'll think twice before confiding in you next time, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
An excellent idea, Mr Naruhodo. An excellent idea. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
Susato:
Well then, Mr Naruhodo, you know what to do, I'm sure.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Let's listen to that great deduction again, and see if we can massage it into shape!
Sholmes:
Very well, then. Let us start once more from the beginning... ...of Herlock Sholmes's magnificent 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!
Course CorrectionHold it, Mr Sholmes!

To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery
Sholmes:
First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer!
Ryunosuke:
So, by Mr Sholmes's reasoning... ...Mr Benedict came here in order to apply for a job so he could dig down through the floor.
Susato:
Yes. In an attempt to tunnel into the sewers to gain access to the money in the vault of the bank across the road. But...he wouldn't get very far with a broken shovel, would he?
Ryunosuke:
No. I think it's fair to say his motives lie elsewhere. The question is, where? What did bring Mr Benedict here at this particular point in time?
Examine staff recruitment flyer
Susato:
It certainly is a flyer for Mr Windibank's shop.
Ryunosuke:
Let's see... 'Windibank's Wants YOU! Pawnbroker's Assistant Required!' It's an eye-catching advertisement, that's for sure.
Susato:
I've seen the same flyer up here inside the shop, I think. Perhaps Mr Windibank is always in need of more staff.
Ryunosuke:
(So Mr Benedict came here to apply for a job? ...That's just too hard to believe.)
Examine stylish hat
Ryunosuke:
That silk top hat is whiter than white. Only an English gentleman could hope to carry off something so bright.
Susato:
But it looks so incongruous with the black overcoat, don't you think?
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps it's the latest London fashion. I mean, that's just guesswork, of course.
Susato:
How about it, Mr Naruhodo? I think you'd look very fetching in a white top hat.
Ryunosuke:
...Well, you know, I think it might look rather incongruous with my black university uniform, so...
Examine cane
Ryunosuke:
That's a proper English gentleman's cane, isn't it? Look at the beautifully polished brass on the handle.
Susato:
Yes, but Mr Sholmes is right. It's not the sort of handle you usually see on a cane.
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps it's the latest London fashion. I mean, that's just guesswork, of course.
Susato:
Perhaps you could adopt a cane, Mr Naruhodo? It might rather suit you.
Ryunosuke:
...I have a feeling it might argue with the sword around my waist.
Examine scribbled writing
Susato:
Oh... Look at all the scribbled notes on the back of the flyer here.
Ryunosuke:
......... I don't believe it!
Susato:
What is it?
Ryunosuke:
Listen to what it says...
'Name: Gina Lestrade
Height: Five foot two
Green cap, scruffy waistcoat, grubby white shirt, blue satchel (ragged)'
It's a detailed description of Miss Lestrade!
Susato:
Goodness!
Ryunosuke:
There's even a sketch of her, hat and all! Although if he showed it to her, she'd fire that smoke grenade launcher in his face for sure...
Susato:
And look. The details of this shop have been written down here, too.
'Windibank's Pawnbrokery, Baker Street.
Redemption deadline: 15th April'
Ryunosuke:
...Which is today's date! (Why would Mr Benedict have all that information scrawled on the back of that piece of paper?)
Changes "scribbled writing" to "info about Miss Lestrade"
Examine info about Miss Lestrade
Ryunosuke:
Suspicious writing on the back of a suspicious flyer in the hands of a suspicious gentleman...
Susato:
I...didn't think there was anything suspicious about the flyer, Mr Naruhodo. But yes, Miss Lestrade's name and height, and a description of the clothes she's wearing...
Ryunosuke:
Not to mention the sketch of her likeness...which I'm fairly sure she wouldn't take lightly. And today's date, too: 'Redemption deadline: 15th April'
Susato:
We can't let this go, can we? It's far too suspicious.
Examine scribbled writing, then present info about Miss Lestrade
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the info about Miss Lestrade!"
Present staff recruitment flyer
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Clearly, you are a man of elegance and style. But elegance and style come at a price. So no matter how much money you have, you always need more. And that is why you came here today! To apply for a job to supplement your income!
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.
Ryunosuke:
An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.
Leads to:
"Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer!"
Present stylish hat
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
You can't judge a book by its cover, as they say. Someone who appears wealthy may well be poor. Being such a man, you're desperate for money. When you realised you had no real need for your hat... ...you brought it here today with the intention of pawning it for as much as the broker would give you!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer!"
Present cane

"Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer!"
Present scribbled writing
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Those notes were scrawled by somebody famous, and as such, are worth a considerable sum of money. The fact that you handle the paper on which they are written with gloves only proves my theory! So you came here today with the intention of pawning it for as much as the broker would give you!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer!"
Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer!
Susato:
I still don't quite understand why this gentleman came to Mr Windibank's today.
Ryunosuke:
He might look like a smartly dressed man about town, but perhaps he's destitute really. I really think that's the only explanation!
Susato:
We must stop thinking along those lines, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...I suppose you're right. Well in that case... ...perhaps there's something in this pawn shop that the man was looking for?
Susato:
Let's look closely and see if there's anything about his person that gives us a clue.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the info about Miss Lestrade!
Sholmes:
Quite so, my dear fellow! It would appear that the writing and sketch on the reverse of the flyer... ...pertain to the pickpocket, Miss Lestrade, and to Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery here.
Benedict:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
You originally told us... ...that you had merely given chase after Miss Lestrade stole the redemption ticket from you.
Sholmes:
But that, sir, is a thinly veiled lie.
Ryunosuke:
It is the information on the back of the flyer that led you here today. By which I mean... Here, to Windibank's Pawnbrokery, and today, the redemption deadline of that overcoat.
Sholmes:
So you waited outside for the young girl matching the description you have written down to arrive.
Benedict:
Hmph!
Sholmes:
And you have gone to some lengths to hide the reason for your pursuit of Miss Lestrade. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions.
Benedict:
...!
Sholmes:
The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction.
Benedict:
What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years!
Sholmes:
The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule.
Ryunosuke:
Um...what's a ferrule?
Susato:
It's the metal cap commonly found on the end of a cane, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, the bit that makes the nice clacking sound on the pavement?
Susato:
Yes, exactly, And Mr Sholmes is right, it appears to be missing on this cane.
Ryunosuke:
...But it doesn't actually look broken, does it?
Susato:
No, it doesn't. Though the gentleman certainly did recoil when Mr Sholmes identified the cane as suspicious.
Ryunosuke:
In other words... ...there's some secret about the cane that Mr Benedict would rather we don't know!
Examine missing ferrule
Ryunosuke:
The end of this cane is just bare wood.
Susato:
Yes, and according to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...this is where the shovel blade would have been attached.
Ryunosuke:
Hm... Couldn't it just be that the tip fell off?
Susato:
I'm sorry, Mr Naruhodo, but I couldn't possibly speculate.
Examine stylish hat
Ryunosuke:
As stylish as it no doubt is, I don't think this white top hat suits the man, do you?
Susato:
No, not at all.
Ryunosuke:
The more I look at it, the more something strikes me as suspicious about it.
Susato:
......... I think perhaps... ...it's not so much that it strikes you as suspicious, but rather that the hat is just striking.
Ryunosuke:
I...suppose you're probably right. (Perhaps the hat isn't what we're looking for.)
Examine initialling
Ryunosuke:
Look here, Miss Susato... There are some letters on the handle!
Susato:
Ah yes, those must be initials, I think. In the West, it's customary for people to engrave their belongings with the first letters of their names.
Ryunosuke:
So, Herlock Sholmes would be 'H. S.' you mean?
Susato:
That's right. And the initials on this cane obviously- ...Oh.
Ryunosuke:
'A. G.'...? (Why does it feel as though that's not quite right?)
Present initialling
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the initialling."
Present missing ferrule
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
I believe we've been looking at this entirely the wrong way around. It's not the ferrule that is missing on this cane; it's the handle! And it's the end that you're holding now that actually has the unusually shaped ferrule!
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.
Ryunosuke:
An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.
Leads to:
"The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule."
Present stylish hat
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
A ferrule is to a cane as a hat is to a gentleman. And while the tip of your cane is bare, the top of your head is hatted. I ask you, could there be a more conspicuous contradiction anywhere in the world?!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule."
The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule.
Ryunosuke:
I don't know, I just can't picture it. I mean, a respectable gentleman strolling the streets of London with a shovel in his hand? (I'm sure it's just that the cane is broken and the ferrule was lost somehow.)
Susato:
Well, there is one thing of which we can be certain in all of this. After all, we saw it with our own eyes. At the mention of his cane, Mr Benedict visibly recoiled.
Ryunosuke:
...! (That's very true. So there's definitely something about this cane that's not right...)
Ryunosuke:
The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the initialling.
Sholmes:
A most astute observation...wouldn't you say, Mr Eggert Benedict?
Benedict:
...!
Sholmes:
We are led to believe, sir, that your initials are 'E. B.'. Yet in a most possessive manner, you have in your grasp a cane bearing the initials 'A. G.'. An incontrovertible contradiction indeed, would you not agree?
Benedict:
No! You're, you're wrong. This cane isn't-
Ryunosuke:
You said before that you'd had that cane for years.
Benedict:
Grrr...
Ryunosuke:
So don't try to tell us that you just borrowed it from a friend or found it in the park!
Sholmes:
In short... ...though you hold yourself to be a gentleman, you have withheld your true name!
Benedict:
...!
Sholmes:
You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong?
Benedict:
I... Well, I...
Sholmes:
And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear?
Benedict:
.........
Sholmes:
Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see.
Ryunosuke:
Let's consider the bare bones of what's happened here: Miss Lestrade redeemed that fine-looking overcoat. And now a mysterious man has appeared, introducing himself with a fake name... ...and claiming that the overcoat belongs to him.
Susato:
But we know that he actually identified Miss Lestrade from a written description. Which suggests that everything else he's told us is untrue.
Ryunosuke:
So what we need to do here... ...is somehow prove that the overcoat cannot possibly belong to him!
Examine handle
Ryunosuke:
It is a rather strange handle for sure.
Susato:
Yes. Certainly unusual for a gentleman's cane. You expect to see such a cane being twirled charmingly by its owner as he skips merrily down the street.
Ryunosuke:
...You do?
Susato:
Ah, something has just occurred to me. We have a shovel back in our office, don't we?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, you're right. And its handle is exactly the same shape as this cane's. (Here we go... Now I'm starting to wonder if it's not actually a cane at all, but a spade.)
Susato:
Mr Sholmes's deductions are curiously compelling, aren't they?
Examine stylish hat
Ryunosuke:
I've been looking closely at this hat for some time now, and it's suddenly occurred to me... ...that a bright white top hat like that might be just the hat for me!
Susato:
......... You like it, do you?
Ryunosuke:
......... I think I do...don't I?
Susato:
Well in that case, you could see if there isn't something similar among Mr Windibank's forfeited items... ...AFTER we've concluded our investigation! We must focus on the task in hand at the moment.
Examine split seam
Susato:
Oh! The seam on the shoulder there is coming apart, look.
Ryunosuke:
So it is.
Susato:
Do you know, a moment ago when Mr Benedict was surprised by something that was said... ...I thought I heard him make a rather strange noise. It sounded a bit like a tiny growl. But now I think it was probably the sound of this seam ripping open.
Ryunosuke:
If you look closely, it does seem to be a very tight fit. The sleeves are stretched to bursting and he wouldn't have a hope of fastening it at the front. If he were to run around in it, I'm sure the whole thing would fall apart.
Susato:
Hmmm...that I'd like to see.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
So how can we make Mr Benedict run around...?
Ryunosuke:
(She's really giving this some thought...)
Present split seam
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The split seam, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see."
Present handle
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The initials on the handle of the cane are 'A. G.', but you introduced yourself as Eggert Benedict. In other words, the cane is not yours. So what else about your person belongs to someone else? The truth is, there's nothing you wouldn't take from another man, is there?
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.
Ryunosuke:
An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.
Leads to:
"The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see."
Present stylish hat
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Your top hat is far too stylish for your own good! Though you might like to conceal it, a hat so conspicuous will always stand out. And that is why I'm convinced that it has to be the answer to this riddle!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see."
The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see.
Ryunosuke:
The man is white all over, but for his overcoat. That's almost reason enough to say it doesn't belong to him, isn't it?
Susato:
But I'm sure the gentleman's wardrobe isn't exclusively white, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Well mine is exclusively black!
Susato:
...I think perhaps we should go shopping together.
Ryunosuke:
(There's no doubt about it. That black overcoat doesn't suit Mr Benedict at all. But we need a more tangible way of proving it...)
Ryunosuke:
The split seam, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see.
Benedict:
Ah!
Sholmes:
Yes, because the overcoat is rather obviously a poor fit.
Ryunosuke:
Having forced it over your broad shoulders, the seam is already breaking apart.
Sholmes:
My suspicions were aroused from the outset... ...when you so baldly lied about your name and so boldly waylaid this pickpocket.
Benedict:
Argh!
Sholmes:
This catalogue of untruths has all been for one very specific purpose: To steal the article that the young girl redeemed from Mr Windibank!
Benedict:
AAAAAARGH!!!
Sholmes:
But what really irks me is this: The considerable crime I initially imagined has been considerably curtailed.

Great Crime
Conclusion
To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds
Sholmes:
Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning.
Benedict:
This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, designed a wheeze to filch some tawdry article of pawnage? Have you forgotten that I redeemed the article in the proper manner, using the watchword? Had I not been the one to deposit it in the first place... ...how could I possibly have known the relevant details? N'est-ce pas?
Sholmes:
Oh, but the watchword can be discovered... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped.
Benedict:
What?
Sholmes:
Let us consider how one might come to learn a secret watchword relating to the pawned property of another... The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn.
Susato:
The direction of the deduction must change rather dramatically now, I think.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, no more talk of tunnelling into the sewers. (Which is a pity, because it all sounded rather exciting.) Anyway... ...you can't deny that this mysterious gentleman did know the watchword.
Susato:
Yes. 'Professor'... If you didn't know that word, Mr Windibank would never allow you to redeem the article.
Ryunosuke:
Or, looking at it another way... ...if you did know that word, Mr Windibank would allow you to redeem the article whether it was yours or not. (So the question is, could this gentleman have found the watchword out somehow?)
Examine council notice
Susato:
'Baker Street Works' is the title.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, and it does mention sewerage works, as Mr Sholmes said. ...Oh! (And specifically mentions that tonight's sale at the confectionary shop on the corner won't be affected...)
Susato:
Case-solving first, confectionary later, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... Curse my overly expressive face...)
Examine old lamp
Ryunosuke:
This looks to be quite an old lamp.
Susato:
But it's obviously been well looked after. And there's oil in it, too.
Ryunosuke:
In other words, it's still in use.
Susato:
Yes, it would appear so. But as for how it could be related to Mr Benedict knowing the watchword for the pawned article... ...I have no idea.
Ryunosuke:
(That makes two of us.)
Examine pawnbroker's revolver
Ryunosuke:
This is Mr Windibank's gun.
Susato:
Yes, loaded with only one bullet, he said. It would appear that being a pawnbroker is a very life-or-death profession.
Ryunosuke:
...That might just be this particular establishment.
Examine notelet
Ryunosuke:
Look at this, Miss Susato.
Susato:
Ah, it appears to be a memo that Mr Windibank has scribbled to himself.
Ryunosuke:
Let's see. What does it say...? Oh! 'Professor'...
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
......... Mr Windibank must make a note of the watchwords his customers give him, right before their eyes. And in alarmingly clear script as well.
Susato:
Oh dear... I, I don't know where to look. Who knows what other secrets I might see!
Present notelet
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The method is revealed by the notelet on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn."
Present council notice
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Council notices could include all sorts of information about local affairs. They're certainly not limited to information about upcoming remedial sewage works. So there's an undeniable possibility that the watchword was sent out to everyone in the neighbourhood!
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.
Ryunosuke:
An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.
Leads to:
"The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn."
Present old lamp
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
This lamp may be old, but it's in tip-top condition, and it's been polished until it gleams. Somehow, by some inexplicable physical phenomenon, the watchword was reflected in the glass chimney... ...and you read it with your superhuman eyesight! It's the only logical explanation!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn."
Present pawnbroker's revolver
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Coercing the broker for information by holding a gun to his head... That's assault. But using the broker's own gun to do it? That's rubbing 'assault' in the wound! But somehow, when none of us were looking, you must have forced Mr Windibank to tell you the watchword!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn."
The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn.
Ryunosuke:
There's no question that Mr Benedict used some wheeze or other to find out the watchword. (Let's think. He only appeared in the shop after Miss Lestrade had redeemed the overcoat...)
Susato:
He certainly couldn't have overheard Miss Lestrade saying the watchword. So he can only have discovered it from something on this countertop.
Ryunosuke:
(It sounds like I need to have another look and examine things more closely this time.)
Ryunosuke:
The method is revealed by the notelet on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn.
Sholmes:
Yes, the broker here follows the same procedure whenever a customer comes to redeem an article. He asks the customer for the watchword, and notes down the response uttered on a notelet he has to hand. Then he consults his ledger, and confirms whether or not the watchword matches that of the article in question.
Benedict:
I would expect nothing less of a diligent pawnbroker.
Ryunosuke:
But his diligence clearly has its disadvantages.
Benedict:
What are you talking about?
Sholmes:
It is increasingly apparent that you were present in this shop before your accusation against Miss Lestrade.
Ryunosuke:
In all likelihood, you followed her inside, and then observed her talking to Mr Windibank.
Sholmes:
When the diligent broker made a note of the watchword, as is his common practice...
Ryunosuke:
...You observed him writing the word 'Professor' on the notelet beside the ledger.
Benedict:
...!
Sholmes:
And that, sir... ...was the master plan you devised to steal the pawned article from the young Miss Lestrade!
Benedict:
M... Master plan?!
Sholmes:
Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... Why would you go to such lengths to redeem that particular article from this pawnbroker?
Benedict:
Are you quite serious?
Sholmes:
For an ill-fitting overcoat hardly seems to justify the effort, much less a worthless music box disk. But naturally, you had very good reason to make them yours, didn't you, Mr Benedict?
Benedict:
I have no idea what you're talking about!
Sholmes:
Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know.
Ryunosuke:
The articles we're talking about are the overcoat and the music box disk that was in one of the pockets.
Susato:
Which according to Mr Windibank, isn't even worth a penny.
Ryunosuke:
And yet this man went to such lengths to steal them... Why?
Susato:
I wonder if perhaps... ...we already have the evidence we need to explain it, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
(Could we? Really? I'd better have a thorough look through all the evidence we've collected so far.)

This man has used some fairly high-handed measures to try to get his hands on the overcoat and the disk.
Susato:
He certainly doesn't want either for their monetary value, though. Still... ...they must be of value somehow. To someone.
Ryunosuke:
......... (This is the last piece of this puzzle. I'd better have another look through the evidence and see if there are any clues hiding.)
Ryunosuke:
You see, this music box disk tells us all we need to know.
Benedict:
What's that...on the back...?
Sholmes:
It reads, 'For McGilded'...
Benedict:
Agh!
Sholmes:
Ah, Mr Magnus McGilded... The unfortunate philanthropist who perished in curious circumstances at the Old Bailey two months ago. A prominent man in London...though his loan-mongering demonstrated a distinct lack of scruples. So...you're an associate of his, are you? Or perhaps a subordinate?
Benedict:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Mr McGilded was a man of unusually small stature. In fact... ...he was precisely the right size for that overcoat that you've squeezed yourself into.
Benedict:
Ugh!
Sholmes:
Your true identity remains shrouded in mystery... Mr Eggert Benedict. But the final conclusion here is crystal clear. The reason you came to this pawnbrokery today...
...was to retrieve an article left behind by the late Magnus McGilded!

Mr Sholmes, I'm afraid there's something very troubling on my mind.
Sholmes:
Pray tell, Miss Susato.
Susato:
Well, according to what Mr Windibank told us earlier... ...today was the final day on which the coat could have been redeemed, was it not?
Windibank:
Yes, ma'am, that is correct. Today would be precisely two months since it was first deposited.
Ryunosuke:
Well, today is 15th April, so...two months ago today...
Windibank:
...Would have been 15th February, sir, that's right. It's all carefully recorded in my ledger. Deposited at 10:30 p.m., I see.
Ryunosuke:
What?! But, but that suggests...
Susato:
Yes. 15th February...
Ryunosuke:
...Is precisely the day on which the omnibus murder took place!
Susato:
And half past ten in the evening... ...is precisely the time at which the terrible events were unfolding!
Sholmes:
Suggestive is not the word. It would seem the matter is entirely beyond coincidence.
Benedict:
......... You are of course at liberty to make whatever outlandish deductions you choose. However... ...I must insist you hand over the music box disk now.
Ryunosuke:

Benedict:
It would be a terrible shame to return to your native land in a box.
Ryunosuke:
Agh... (What do I do?!)
Hand over the disk

Windibank:
Hold it!

Ryunosuke:
Mr Windibank, no!
???:
Alright, that's enough!
Ryunosuke:
Inspector Gregson!
Benedict:
Inspector...?
Gregson:
That's right, sunshine. The alarm was raised on one of our dedicated emergency lines. So we got here as fast as we could. Now, what's this all about, eh?
Windibank:
Oh, praise be! You're here at last! I was moments away from forfeiting my own life in my very own establishment!
Benedict:
......... It would seem you have the upper hand.
Gregson:
Right, you lot have got some explainin' to do! I don't appreciate bein' bothered with some petty argy-bargy!
Susato:
Petty?! Mr Windibank very nearly met with his end!
Gregson:
Yeah, with his own gun, as far as I can tell.
Windibank:
Oh dear...
Gregson:
And the whole of Britain could meet with its end if I don't get to the bottom of the case I'm s'posed to be workin' on!
Ryunosuke:
What?! What on earth is the case, Inspector?
Sholmes:
Spare no detail, Gregson!
Gregson:

Gregson:
Aah!
He's getting away!
Get after him, lads! Whistle the beat officer, too!Sir!
Gregson:
...There's been a spate of thefts at pawn shops round here recently. So we've fitted emergency buttons underneath the counters for brokers to let us know when there's trouble.
Windibank:
Oh, Inspector...I was very worried there for a while. Very worried indeed.

Now then, Mr Permanently-in-Mournin'...
Ryunosuke:
Oh! ...Yes?
Gregson:
I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes, of course...
Gina:
No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!
Gregson:
I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.
Ryunosuke:
As evidence...?
Sholmes:
If the police demand something as evidence, my dear fellow, we have no choice but to capitulate. It's all yours, Inspector.
Gina:
Grrr...
Ryunosuke:And so, we handed Mr McGilded's disk over to Inspector Gregson... ...and were summarily turfed out of the shop and onto the street.

Anything else
Ryunosuke:
So, about this...
Susato:
......... Wait! I must have more time to examine it thoroughly!
Ryunosuke:
Really, there's no need. If it's not relevant at the moment, you can just say so. (Susato-san takes everything so seriously...)
15th April
Baker Street
Gina:
See? That's why I 'ate grown-ups. All they do is feed you a pack o' lies and take stuff away from ya!
Sholmes:
Oh really, Miss Lestrade? ...Tell me, is that overcoat keeping you warm?
Gina:
Wot?
Susato:
Oh my! Surely, you were given that!
Gina:
Yeah, the dee let me keep it. After I looked daggers at 'im for long enough. 'E went through the pockets and then said, 'Go on, then, 'ave it' before tellin' me to scarper. Always pays off, givin' people a look like you 'ate 'em.
Ryunosuke:
I can't help feeling that it's going to get you into serious trouble one day...
Gina:
Wot I really wanted was that nice, shiny disk, mind.
Susato:
The music box disk?
Ryunosuke:
But Mr Windibank said it was practically worthless.
Gina:
I think I'm gonna go and 'ave another bash. Give 'em a long, 'ard stare.
Sholmes:
I think not, Miss Lestrade. We shan't enter Windibank's again today.
Gina:
Why not?! That's not fair!
Ryunosuke:
It can't be helped, I'm afraid. The police are investigating the scene now, and taking a statement from Mr Windibank.
Gina:
But that disk's mine! I 'ad the ticket for this coat, and it was in this coat's pocket! And there should be somefin' else an' all! That's wot that rotten cove said, ain't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, he did mention something about another article, didn't he?
Gina:
Well then, that's mine, too! Wotever it is!
Ryunosuke:
(Now she's really pushing her luck...)
Sholmes:
Miss Lestrade, I think it's time to admit defeat. You've had your 'haul' for the day.
Gina:
Yeah! And it's all your fault, Sholmes!
Sholmes:
So what are your plans now? Will you dine with us this evening?
Gina:
Eh?
Sholmes:
Iris would be delighted to cook, I'm sure. And I might entertain you with a modest violin recital.
Gina:
......... No, ta.
Sholmes:
Oh...
Gina:
Why would I come round your place, eh? 'Ave you lost your 'ead or somefin'?!
Susato:
Oh dear. She's gone.
Sholmes:
Hm, having reviled on me quite unnecessarily, I might add.
Ryunosuke:
I...can't help wondering... ...if perhaps she might turn up anyway.
Sholmes:
Interesting...
Ryunosuke:
Once she's had a chance to calm down, I think there's a good chance she'll decide to come.
Sholmes:
......... Very well, then. I'll inform Iris to set a place for our potential guest at the dinner table this evening. And one more thing... I should be glad of your company later, too.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
I believe I will have a rather splendid surprise to show you.
Susato:
Oh, how exciting! What is it?
Sholmes:
You shall have to wait and see, Miss Susato. ...Until later, then!
15th April, 3:46 p.m.
Sholmes's Suite
Iris:
Ah, Susie! And Runo! Come in, come in!
Ryunosuke:
Good afternoon, Iris.
Susato:
Thank you so much for breakfast this morning.
Iris:
Oh, don't mention it! ...Goodness! Look at the time already!
Ryunosuke:
Busy as always?
Iris:
I am! I'm preparing everything for dinner this evening.
Ryunosuke:
Already? You're obviously cooking something special, are you?
Iris:
Oh, yes! After all, we have a special guest joining us! Guess who it is! Go on! Hee hee, you'll never guess!
Ryunosuke:
Um... (Look at those little eyes of hers shining!)
Susato:
Oh dear. It is awkward when you already know the answer, isn't it?
Iris:
It's Ginny! Isn't that exciting?!
Susato:
Oh! Oh...what a surprise! Yes, that's wonderful news!
Ryunosuke:
(Wow, Iris seems overjoyed at the idea!)
Iris:
I can't wait to learn some pickpocketing tips from a real professional!
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes! That does sound like fun!
Susato:
I'm not sure that's entirely appropriate. Are you, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Erm... By the way, Iris, what's Mr Sholmes up to?
Iris:
Hurley? Oh, he's been like that ever since he got back.
Ryunosuke:
...Hellooo! Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
I beg that you won't speak to me.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
I don't know who you are, but kindly take your leave. As you can see, I'm not here.
Ryunosuke:
......... (I, I don't know how to respond to that.)
Iris:
I do apologise. When he gets like this, he's completely oblivious to everything.
Ryunosuke:
Yes... I see...
Iris:
Really, he behaves just like a child sometimes, Hurley does.
Susato:
Mr Sholmes and Iris have something of a parent-and-child relationship, don't they?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, except that Iris is clearly the parent here... (Come to think of it... ...I wonder where her real parents are.)
Iris:
What's the matter, Runo? You have ever such a funny look on your face!
Ryunosuke:
Oh...no...it's nothing.
Iris:
I know what it is! 'Why does this girl live here with Mr Sholmes?' you're wondering. ...Am I right?
Ryunosuke:
How?! How did you...?
Iris:
Heh heh, oh, Runo! I can read you like a book!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... This girl is dangerous...)
Iris:
Don't worry, you can ask me anything! I won't mind.
Examine
Herlock Sholmes
Ryunosuke:
So, Mr Sholmes, what are you so engrossed in?
Sholmes:
...Did you not hear? I am not here!
Ryunosuke:
(...Of course you're not.)
Sholmes:
I cannot think why the whole bed of the ocean is not one solid mass of oysters, so prolific the creatures seem!
Ryunosuke:
Haah... (He won't even turn around and look at me...)
Iris:
It's best just to leave him alone when he's in one of his moods like this.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, I can see that.
Violin
Ryunosuke:
Now this really is Mr Sholmes's faithful performing partner, then. The Stravidar... The Strappyscar... The Scrapifarious...? (No, it's no good. It's gone.) The virtuoso's violin that he found in a pawnbroker's and managed to buy for next to nothing.
Susato:
After all we went through to get it back, he's just cast it aside on that chair. I was looking forward to hearing the beautiful sound it makes when Mr Sholmes plays it.
Ryunosuke:
It does look rather sorry for itself there, doesn't it? (Although... ...at least Wagahai hasn't attacked it yet. Even if his eyes are saying it's only a matter of time...)
Converse
Ginny
Ryunosuke:
So, by Ginny...you mean Miss Lestrade, the young woman from the McGilded case two months ago, right?
Iris:
Yes! Who also stole my experimental smoke grenade launcher! Although after that trial I invited her back here and we had dinner together. And now we're the best of friends!
Susato:
Oh! Hee hee, what a lovely tale!
Iris:
Yes! Now if I bump into her on the street...she runs away as fast as she can!
Susato:
...Oh.
Iris:
And I chase after her down the back alleys!
Ryunosuke:
(Interesting idea of friendship...)
Iris:
And then I let her have the latest colour of smoke grenade I've developed.
Susato:
Oh...
Iris:
There are so many beautiful colours in the world! Ginny wants me to make a whole rainbow!
Ryunosuke:
I suppose this means... ...you've let Miss Lestrade keep the smoke grenade launcher, have you?
Iris:
Yes, that's right! I'd got bored of it anyway. Hurley always reacts the same way when I shoot him with it now.
Ryunosuke:
(Poor 'Hurley'...)
Iris:
Ooh, I can't wait for Ginny to arrive! It's been too long since she last came over. I'm so excited!
Ryunosuke:
(I just hope she does actually come.)
Living with Sholmes
Iris:
I'm sure you've been wondering why it is that I live here with Hurley, haven't you?
Ryunosuke:
Well...it has crossed my mind. That, and where are your real parents?
Iris:
My mummy and daddy aren't with me any more.
Susato:
...!
Iris:
Mummy passed away when I was born. And at around the same time, my father... Well, he had to go to a faraway land because of one of the cases he and Hurley were working on.
Ryunosuke:
Oh... Wait a minute... Did you say, 'he and Hurley'?
Iris:
Yes. Daddy and Hurley were always solving mysterious cases together!
Ryunosuke:
(She didn't mention that before...)
Iris:
He wrote them all up in his diaries. That's what's in the metal chest over there.
Ryunosuke:
Really? He recorded them all?
Susato:
So...you mean it's true? Mr Sholmes... ...really did have a partner with whom he tackled some of his most taxing cases?!
Iris:
Oh yes! I mean, it's always nice to have one, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
So Mr Sholmes's partner...was your father?
Iris:
Exactly! Hurley told me I wasn't allowed to look in the chest. But that only made me want to look even more! ...So I opened it up.
Susato:
And found your father's memoirs.
Iris:
Yes. So I asked Hurley: 'Who wrote these?' He nearly fell off his chair! But then he told me. That's when I found out that the author of all those accounts... ...was my father.
Ryunosuke:
(So Iris's father was Mr Sholmes's partner...)
Iris's father (appears after "Living with Sholmes")
Iris:
I've practically lived with Hurley all my life. I was tiny when he took me in. So...it came as quite a shock. When Hurley told me he wasn't really my daddy, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
It must have done.
Susato:
I wonder why Mr Sholmes chose to tell you. And at such a young age.
Iris:
Hurley says it's because he wouldn't have been able to hide it from me.
Susato:
Oh?
Iris:
Well, having lived with Hurley all these years, you might say that his ways have rubbed off on me. There are some things I can just...see. Especially lies. I almost know when people are lying before they open their mouths sometimes.
Ryunosuke:
Right...
Iris:
Anyway, I was so fascinated when I read Daddy's diaries. That's what inspired me to write 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', actually.
Susato:
I'd always assumed Mr Sholmes simply told you all those thrilling stories.
Iris:
Oh no, Hurley's hopeless like that. He forgets everything. As soon as he's solved a case, it all but vanishes from his mind.
Susato:
Oh, I see.
Iris:
The other day it was so embarrassing. As usual, he totally forgot about the case he'd just solved... ...so the very next day he gathered together all the people involved and proceeded to solve the case again! It was quite a shock for everyone!
Ryunosuke:
(...You can say that again.)
Susato:
...You share your father's surname, don't you, Iris?
Iris:
That's right! Wilson. Daddy is Dr John H. Wilson! I learnt from his diaries that he's a doctor of medicine, you see. That's what prompted me to study and study so that I could earn a doctorate as well!
Ryunosuke:
(Iris's father...who went to some distant land... ...and is a doctor by the name of John H. Wilson...)
Judge:
The court will now hear the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
Judge:
Kindly state before the court the name of the victim in this case.
Ryunosuke:
The victim's name was Dr John H. Wilson.
That's right...visiting professor of medicine at Imperial Yumei University... ...and the man who, in the most bizarre of circumstances, lost his life just before we left Japan.
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato...
Susato:
...Yes.
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps we shouldn't pursue this conversation any further at this time.
Susato:
...I think that would be for the best.

Ryunosuke:
Would you mind if I showed you this, Iris? It's just a boring old thing, really, but...
Iris:
Oh. I don't really like boring things.
Ryunosuke:
Ah... (It looks like Japanese modesty is easily misinterpreted by young Western children...)
Iris:
I mean, who DOES like boring things? No one wants to be shown something boring. Come to think of it, you're always introducing things with, 'This is boring, but...' It's a bad habit. You should stop it.
Ryunosuke:
...I'll be sure to let the entire population of the Empire of Japan know on my return.
After clearing all Converse options:
Sholmes:
Ah, my dear fellows! How good to see you!
Susato:
Eek! Mr, Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
Whyever did you not make your presence known to me before?
Ryunosuke:
...Haah.
Sholmes:
Well, no matter now. So, how the devil are you?
Ryunosuke:
We've...been with you for most of the day.
Sholmes:
Goodness, really?
Susato:
Do tell me, Mr Sholmes, is your violin unscathed?
Sholmes:
Hm? My violin? Whatever are you talking about, dear madam?
Susato:
Oh! Um...
Sholmes:
Never mind that now. I have something far more interesting to show you. Behold, my dear fellows!
Susato:
Oh, another music box disk.
Sholmes:
No, not 'another' disk, Miss Susato. This is the one Gregson demanded we hand over as evidence: Mr McGilded's disk!
Susato:
Oh my!
Ryunosuke:
Then, then...what's it doing here?!
Sholmes:
Heh heh heh! You know, at times, Mr Naruhodo... ...I think that though I have an undeniable turn for detection... ...I may well be even more adept at larceny!
Iris:
Ooh! That would be wonderfully exciting! I'd be your pickpocketing assistant! And Runo could be our go-to lawyer if we ever got caught!
Ryunosuke:
Right...
Iris:
Plus, Susie has such beautiful handwriting, she could write all our menacing crime notifications!
Susato:
Yes! I'd be delighted!
Ryunosuke:
(I'm just going to pretend this conversation never happened, I think.)
Converse
The music box disk
Ryunosuke:
I, I don't understand... How did that disk come to be in your possession? I thought Inspector Gregson took it back to Scotland Yard.
Sholmes:
Quite correct. And that sort of uncompromising attitude is precisely why I always carry some of this.
Susato:
That's...a bar of caramel, Mr Sholmes.
Ryunosuke:
Your one and only friend in times of loneliness, if I'm not mistaken.
Sholmes:
If you will humour me, my dear fellows... ...cast your minds back to when the good detective confiscated the disk.
Gregson:
I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes, of course...
Sholmes:
If the police demand something as evidence, my dear fellow, we have no choice but to capitulate. It's all yours, Inspector.
Sholmes:
For the briefest of moments, I had the disk in my hand, did I not?
Ryunosuke:
Yes... Yes, you did. But...I still don't understand.
Sholmes:
It was at precisely that moment, that I summoned my one and only friend into action. I pressed the disk into a pair of bars...like this.
Ryunosuke:
That's...that's amazing! The disk and all the miniscule protrusions have made an image in the caramel!
Sholmes:
Indeed. This caramel is quite exceptional. I developed it myself, you know. Suitably soft for making impressions, but resistant to melting. The result of a precisely controlled solution.
Susato:
How extraordinary!
Sholmes:
Carrying a pair of these on one's person frequently proves very useful indeed. Take a house key, for example. A simple press, and its unique form is duplicated. I can enter anyone's property at will. And never without high-sucrose nourishment.
Ryunosuke:
Yeees... It sounds...illegal.
Sholmes:
From the image, I was able to create this. I confess I was most curious to know what manner of music would issue from the disk when played.
The music on the disk (appears after "The music box disk")
Susato:
Do tell us, then, Mr Sholmes! What music does the disk play?
Sholmes:
Well...unfortunately I have no idea.
Ryunosuke:
No idea?
Sholmes:
None whatsoever. Are you familiar with the workings of a music box, my dear fellows?
Ryunosuke:
No, I'm afraid not.
Iris:
Goodness! You don't know, Runo? Inside a music box, there's a special metal piece called a 'comb'. That's what produces the sound. Small protuberances pluck the different teeth of the comb as they rotate past it, making the different notes. The first music boxes to be invented used a rotating cylinder with protuberances on it.
Sholmes:
But over time, a new type of player was produced, which uses disks such as these. With that development, the popularity of music boxes spread far and wide. All around the globe.
Susato:
Why, exactly?
Sholmes:
Because the disks are easy to produce, and can be interchanged to facilitate the playing of different tunes. There are a great many firms in Europe now manufacturing music boxes as a result.
Susato:
It is wonderful to be able to enjoy music, even when no performer is present.
Sholmes:
But it is the very success of the invention that means we are now presented with an insurmountable problem.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Sholmes:
As you may imagine, the construction of one firm's music box does not match that of another. And we have no way of knowing in which music box this particular disk was designed to be played. There is no resolution to this problem, I'm afraid. It's quite intractable.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, I see. So that's why...
Sholmes:
Naturally, I tested the disk in those few music boxes I have at my disposal. But as you can hear, to no avail. The results were equally unsatisfactory in this one. So... ...I am presently engaged in acquiring an example of all the music boxes ever made in Europe.
Susato:
E-Every single one?!
Iris:
That's Hurley for you. Always taking things too far.
Sholmes:
But, my dear girl! An unsolved riddle is quite repugnant to my constitution!
Ryunosuke:
But surely all the different types in Europe will amount to a huge volume of music boxes, won't it?
Sholmes:
Hm, yes, that is certainly true. In the worst case... ...I shall just have to ask you to vacate the attic room.
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Magnus McGilded
Sholmes:
Magnus McGilded... Not a name I expected to hear again so soon.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes... It's only been two months since that grisly case...) Mr McGilded perished within hours of the trial's conclusion.
Was it the curse of the Reaper? No one knows, still now. The omnibus was reduced to a pile of ash. Not a shred of evidence remained. And with the man's death... ...the truth about the murder in which he was so intimately involved was buried.
Ryunosuke:
Even though we successfully established Mr McGilded's innocence in the trial...
Susato:
...The newspapers are still claiming that it remains an unsolved case.
Ryunosuke:
The murder of the brickmaker, Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason... In the end, the truth of the matter remains a mystery. We still have no idea what really happened that night. And although Mr McGilded was found not guilty through my defence... ...I still don't know if that was the right judgement or not.
Sholmes:
It would appear the case is not yet closed.

Iris:
Well, it's time I started getting things ready for dinner, I think. Ginny will be here before long.
Sholmes:
Thank you, Iris.
Susato:
Oh, well you must let me help you, then.
Iris:
Of course, Susie! There's plenty to do.
Sholmes:
I think I shall investigate the condition of my faithful performing partner. Now then...where did I leave it...?
Ryunosuke:
Let this be a lesson to you, Mr Sholmes: Never leave anything too precious with the pawnbroker.
Sholmes:
Hm, yes... You may be right.
Susato:
Oh, that reminds me! Of something Mr Windibank said before. He said that he had a manuscript of Iris's in pawn, didn't he?
Sholmes:
Did he?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, he definitely mentioned it. 'Mr Sholmes's latest tale of otherworldly mystery lies dormant in my storeroom,' were his words, I believe.
Iris:
So you heard about that, did you? I expect you were as incensed as I was!
Susato:
Oh yes! The idea of such a wonderful story languishing in Mr Windibank's storeroom, gathering dust...
Sholmes:
My dear madam, I'm quite sure I told you already... ...the pawnbroker's storeroom is the safest place for it. More secure than a bank's vault!
Iris:
And what about your Stradivarius, Hurley? Was that safe and secure?
Sholmes:
Weeell... There may be the occasional mix-up.
Ryunosuke:
(Caused by a certain impetuous someone not too far from me now...)
Iris:
Do you have any idea how long it took me to write that Baskerville story, Hurley?
Susato:
Oh, it sounds so exciting! 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'! I should love to read it!
Iris:
.........
Sholmes:
.........
Susato:
.........Ah!
Ryunosuke:
......... (What's going on here? Why does it feel like an icy chill just swept through the room?)
Iris:
Susie...what did you just say?
Susato:
Erm...
Iris:
You said...'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... But...how could you know the full title?
Susato:
Well, that's... .........
Ryunosuke:
That's because Miss Susato is such a great fan of all the stories about Mr Sholmes, of course.
Iris:
But Runo, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... ...has never been published.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Iris:
When I showed Hurley the manuscript, he told me that I wasn't allowed to publish it yet.
Ryunosuke:
I don't understand...
Iris:
That's why he said that he'd keep it safe. Until it was the right time for the story to be made public, you see.
Ryunosuke:
So that's why the manuscript is at Windibank's...?
Iris:
And yet, how could Susie here know its title? Well Hurley? What's going on?
Sholmes:
......... ...Ah!
Ryunosuke:
...? What is it, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
It would appear our guest has arrived.
Ryunosuke:
Miss Lestrade!
Gina:
......... ...This was a bad idea. I knew I weren't welcome. I'm goin'!
Ryunosuke:
No! Wait! ...Miss Lestrade! We've all been eagerly awaiting your arrival. ...Haven't we, Iris?
Iris:
......... Oh yes! Just wait there, Ginny. We'll have everything ready in a jiffy! Come along, Susie!
Susato:
Right! Of course! It's a pleasure to see you here, Miss Lestrade. Please, make yourself at home!
Sholmes:
Don't stand in the doorway, my dear girl. Come along in! What say you to some Mendelssohn? I won't take 'no' for an answer!
Ryunosuke:
...Meddlesome it is, then.
Gina:
.........
Wagahai:
...Miaow.
Ryunosuke:
That evening... ...Iris prepared us all a meal that was even more delicious than usual... ...Mr Sholmes's violin performance was in no way meddlesome... ...and Gina, as we came to call her, taught us all how to steal things from one another without being noticed. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves...well into the night.

Susato:
Best of all...I bet I could steal the glasses from His Lordship's face next time we're in court! ......... Naruhodo-san...could I consult with you about something, I wonder?
Ryunosuke:

Ryunosuke:
Ah... (The one that arrived first thing this morning, I suppose.)
Susato:
......... I've...I've been summoned.
Ryunosuke:
What?! Summoned? ...What do you mean?
Susato:
The telegram was from the Lord Chief Justice's office. Lord Stronghart has asked to see me.
Ryunosuke:
The Lord Chief Justice? ...When?
Susato:
Tomorrow morning.
Ryunosuke:
What?! Then, then we have to start preparing at once!
Susato:
Oh! No...that won't be necessary, Naruhodo-san. I've been summoned alone.
Ryunosuke:
Alone? What on earth for?
Susato:
......... I have no idea. I suppose I shall find out tomorrow.

How lovely! Let me make a pot of tea.
Iris:
You know, I've learnt so much today!

Well, you see... ...I came to return this.

(What's wrong with this room exactly? I like it.)
Gina Lestrade (after clearing a Converse option with Iris Wilson)
Your parents (appears after clearing "The manuscript" Converse option with Iris Wilson)
Ryunosuke:
I've realised that I don't know anything about your parents, Gina.
Gina:
I ain't got any, 'ave I? ...Never did 'ave.
Susato:
Oh...
Gina:
Look, the East End's full of orphans like me. No one wants nuffin' to do wiv us, from the minute we're born. Not even our mums.
Iris:
.........
Gina:
But we all stick together. The older ones look after the little'uns an' make sure they get by.
Susato:
So that's why you're a pickpocket!
Gina:
......... Nah. Divin's my life. I love it. I get a kick out of it every time I lift some pompous idiot's purse. And that's 'ow we all afford to eat. I'm like Robin 'Ood, ain't I? That's 'ow I see it.
Susato:
Oh, Gina...
Gina:
I do think about it sometimes. Wot it'd be like to 'ave parents, I mean. I always thought it'd make everyfin' right. But 'avin' listened to wot Iris just said... ...it sounds like 'avin' parents ain't always easy, either.
Iris:
Oh!
Gina:
I mean, if you know you never 'ad 'em, you don't feel like yer always wantin' to meet 'em.
Iris:
......... It's true...
Susato:
...!
Iris:
I do want to see Daddy. So much.
Susato:
Oh, Iris...
Gina:
.........
Sholmes's lie (appears after clearing "The Hound of the Baskervilles" Converse option with Iris Wilson)
Ryunosuke:
Gina, what did you mean when you said that you know Mr Sholmes is lying to Iris?
Gina:
Well, 'e reckons 'e popped that 'mantelscript' or wotever, right? But come on! That's obviously a load o' rubbish!
Susato:
Oh my! Why would you think that, Gina?
Gina:
It's simple! If that story was really in old Windibank's storeroom... ...there's no way someone from 'alf way around the world - in other words, you - could know about it.
Susato:
Ah...
Gina:
Sorry, Iris, but if you ask me, 'e's sold it. Wivout tellin' you.
Iris:
But Hurley would never do something like that. I'm sure of it.
Gina:
Hah! Grown-ups do a lot worse than that, believe me. Barefaced liars, the lot of 'em! You just ain't realised it yet.
Iris:
.........
Gina:
I'm tellin' ya, that 'mantelscript' ain't at Windibank's. You'd soon see if you 'ad a look! Even if you think you can trust 'im, I don't! That Sholmes is a liar like the rest of 'em!
Iris:
......... If I'm honest... ...I have wondered if Hurley's telling me the truth sometimes.
Gina:
See...
Iris:
Oh, but I don't mean that I think he sold it! I mean that I sometimes wonder if he might have hidden my manuscript somewhere. Somewhere I don't know. Even though it's wrong of me to doubt him...
Ryunosuke:
Don't be too hard on yourself, Iris.
Gina:
.........
Anything else
Iris:
Runo, what are you doing?
Gina:
Look, I'm not gonna steal nuffin', alright? ...It's all junk anyway.
Ryunosuke:
(...Charming. I suppose I should engage our guests in conversation, really...)

The manuscript
Susato:
Iris, I... I suppose you're hoping to talk about the manuscript, aren't you?
Iris:
...Aren't you going to tell me?
Susato:
......... I'm so sorry. I...need a little more time...please.
Iris:
......... Alright, I understand. I hope I haven't made you feel awkward.
Susato:
Oh no, not at all, Iris. Not at all.
Gina:
I dunno wot all this is about really, but... ...it's a story you made up, is it, Iris, this 'mantelscript' or wotever you call it?
Iris:
It's not exactly a story that I made up. It's something I read in Daddy's diaries.
Gina:
'Daddy's'...?
Iris:
That's right. I don't suppose I've mentioned it to you before, Ginny, but... ...my daddy was Hurley's assistant once. His partner.
Gina:
Eh?!
Iris:
They solved all sorts of strange and mysterious cases together.
Gina:
Is, is that right, mister?
Ryunosuke:
Apparently so. I was as surprised as you are, though.
Iris:
And Daddy wrote all the details of every single case down, you see. In his diaries. So I study them and write my stories based on what actually happened.
Gina:
So...where's yer old man now then?
Iris:
......... He...had to go away on urgent business. To a faraway land. And he'll be gone a very long time. So...I've never really met him.
Gina:
...Oh. Right.
Ryunosuke:
(Come to think of it... ...I don't know anything about Gina's parents either. Perhaps we should ask her.)
The Hound of the Baskervilles
Ryunosuke:
Iris, this 'Hound of the Baskervilles' story... I take it that it's another tale inspired by your father's accounts?
Iris:
That's right. I thought it was fascinating. But it's different somehow. From the other ones, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
Oh? How?
Iris:
I don't really know. But it must be special in some way. Because after I'd written it and I showed the manuscript to Hurley... ...he turned white as a sheet. It was the first time I've ever seen him like that.
Sholmes:
It pains me to have to say this after you've toiled over it for so long, Iris... ...but this story must not be published at this time. ...Under any circumstances.
Iris:
But why not? It's one of my best works!
Sholmes:
...I'm not at liberty to say. Not now. So please, do not ask me.
Iris:
......... ...Alright then, I won't.
Sholmes:
But I do solemnly swear that I will explain everything one day, Iris. When the time is right.
Ryunosuke:
And that's how the manuscript came to be with Mr Windibank, isn't it?
Iris:
Yes. Hurley said it had to be somewhere very safe.
Gina:
That really gets my goat, that does! 'E's treatin' you like a child! It's mean, that's wot it is, keepin' secrets like that!
Ryunosuke:
I'm sure Mr Sholmes isn't trying to be mean.
Gina:
Eh?
Ryunosuke:
If he said he wasn't at liberty to talk about it, I'm sure there must have been a very good reason.
Susato:
......... I think so, too.
Gina:
Tsk, you lot are too trustin' for yer own good. But 'e can't pull the wool over my eyes. Sholmes is lyin' to Iris, I bet my life on it!
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Iris:
Hurley's...lying to me...?
After clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson and Gina Lestrade:
Iris:
Oh my goodness! Look at the time! Come along, Ginny, we should go back downstairs.
Gina:
Yeah...alright.
Iris:
And please, don't mention any of this to Hurley, will you?
Ryunosuke:
No...of course not. Good night then, Iris. Good night, Gina.
Susato:
You must let me make breakfast for you tomorrow morning! I insist!
Iris:
Oh, yes please! I can't wait, Susie! Good night, then!
Ryunosuke:
(Iris... It sure is easy to forget, isn't it? Sometimes she speaks just like an adult. But deep down, she's still just a child.)
Susato:
Well, I think it's time that I turned in for the night, too, Naruhodo-san.
Ryunosuke:
Dr John H. Wilson... Iris's father... But also... ...the name of the murdered visiting professor at Yumei University. It can't be a mere coincidence... There's something deeper going on... ........................... .................. .........
???:
...ster Naruhodo... ...Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
(That voice... That's...Mr Sholmes!) What's going on? It's the middle of the night.
Sholmes:
It's Miss Lestrade... She's gone.
Ryunosuke:
Gina?
Sholmes:
She was supposed to be sleeping in Iris's room. But her bed is empty.
Ryunosuke:
Well...she's an independent young woman. She probably decided to go home, no?
Sholmes:
I think not. From speaking to her before she retired... ...I received the distinct impression that she was looking forward to breakfasting with Miss Susato. No, I don't believe the girl has gone home. But I've been waiting for over an hour now.
Ryunosuke:
Over an hour? Oh...
Sholmes:
If you'll indulge me, look out of the window, my dear fellow.
Ryunosuke:
(What's this about?) ...! Wait a minute... (Why is there a light on at this time of night?)
Sholmes:
That's Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Windibank's... (Oh no!)
Gina:
It's simple! If that story was really in old Windibank's storeroom... ...there's no way someone from 'alf way around the world - in other words, you - could know about it.
Gina:
Sorry, Iris, but if you ask me, 'e's sold it. Wivout tellin' you.
Ryunosuke:
(Could Gina have gone...?)
Sholmes:
It seems you have some knowledge of the situation, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? ...Oh, no! No, not really.
Sholmes:
Well anyway, we must investigate.

At once!
Ryunosuke:

Ryunosuke:
The door to Windibank's... It's open!
Susato:
And the lamp is burning.
Ryunosuke:
It must be Gina...mustn't it?
Sholmes:
Let us hope it's nothing more sinister.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Sholmes:
Come, there's not a moment to lose! Clearly something is afoot inside!
Ryunosuke:
...There's no one here...
Sholmes:
...Oh yes... ...there is!
*BANG!*
Susato:
AAAAAAAH!!! Mr Sholmes! Mr Shooolmes!!!
Ryunosuke:
What the- (Has Sholmes been shot?!)
Sholmes:
Leave me, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
But...
Sholmes:
After them! Go!
Ryunosuke:
Right!
Ryunosuke:
...Blast! (I've lost them!)

'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere?
Bobby:
The alarm was just raised from this pawnbroker's sir. Would you know somethin' about that?
Ryunosuke:
Officer! Come with me! It's my friend! Mr Sholmes! He's been shot!
Bobby:
Shot?!
Ryunosuke:
With the policeman close behind me, I ran back to Windibank's...
Anime cutscene
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes!
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
How bad is it?
Sholmes:
Agh...never mind me. But there's much at stake. Behind that door... In the storeroom! ...Hurry!
Ryunosuke:
Huh?! It's...it's Gina?!
To be continued...
*BANG!*
AAAAAAAH!!!
I'll be alright, Mr Naruhodo! After them! Go! Behind that door. In the storeroom! ...Hurry!
It's...it's Gina?!
From that moment, Windibank's Pawnbrokery became a crime scene. Everything that followed happened in a whirlwind of activity. The arrival of the police, the preliminary investigation of the scene and the questioning... It was just before dawn before I was allowed back to my lodgings at 221B.

Examine evidence
Armband
Insignia on front
Iris:
Those are the Scales of Justice, aren't they?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's right. Miss Susato says they symbolise equality and fairness of judgement.
Iris:
But if it's the symbol used by defence lawyers... ...shouldn't it at least be leaning a little to the not guilty side?
Ryunosuke:
...My thoughts exactly.
Inside of armband
Iris:
Oh! I've seen letters like these before. They're called 'kanji', aren't they? So is this how you write your name in Japanese?
Ryunosuke:
Actually, no. That's not my name at all.
Iris:
......... Runo, you know that stealing is wrong, don't you?
Ryunosuke:
......... (First of all, I inherited this from my best friend on his death. Second of all, if anyone has stolen it, it's you! You just grabbed it from me!)
Iris:
Is everything alright? You've gone very quiet all of a sudden.
Ryunosuke:
It's a long story. Too long for now. We'll talk about it another time.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Iris!
Iris:
A telegram came. But all it said was, 'Wait at home'.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes, we asked one of the policemen to have it sent. It was simply impossible to come back.
Iris:
When I woke up...I was all alone. Hurley and Ginny were gone. Everyone was gone. What happened, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
(Poor Iris. She's trembling. She's obviously trying very hard not to let herself get too worried.) ...I'll explain everything that I know.
Iris:
Something awful has happened, hasn't it?
Ryunosuke:
......... Yes, I'm afraid so.
Examine
Spade
Ryunosuke:
That spade has been in here since we started renting the place.
Iris:
Runo! That's not a spade, it's a shovel.
Ryunosuke:
Ah. You're a shoveller, are you? I had a feeling you'd pick me up on that.
Iris:
Oh no...a pick is something else entirely.
Ryunosuke:
(...Now I've dug myself into an even deeper hole.)
Tea set
Ryunosuke:
So this is the tea set that Miss Susato brought with her from Japan. Let's hope she hasn't noticed me slipping sugar and milk into my cup when she makes it. It's just so bitter!
Iris:
Susie's lovely green tea has had quite an impact on Hurley, you know. He's stopped putting milk and sugar in his coffee, even. And Hurley is normally bitterly opposed to bitterness.
Stove or kettle
Ryunosuke:
It's spring at last, and the weather is warmer now. But I love the smell of the fire and the steam rising from the kettle.
Iris:
Oh, how about some tea, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
Thanks, Iris, but I'm alright for now. (With the green tea Susato-san makes me from time to time and Iris's unique herbal infusions... ...this place is paradise for a true tea-lover.)
Iris:
If you're sure. You know I always have plenty whenever you're feeling thirsty!
Desk in back
Ryunosuke:
We've only been here in London for about two months, but my desk is starting to look a little messy already.
Iris:
Hurley's desk is far worse, you know.
Ryunosuke:
I'm sure if I try hard enough, I can make my desk as messy as Mr Sholmes's.
Iris:
Hm...I wonder...
Ryunosuke:
You don't think I can?
Iris:
Well, it takes a certain genius to reach that level of disorder, you know.
Ryunosuke:
(Hm, the path to true mess is long and arduous, it seems...)
Daruma doll
Ryunosuke:
Ah, the daruma doll I brought with me from home. Still with only one eye coloured in. I said I'd colour the other eye once I won my first court case here in Britain, but...
Iris:
That's cruel, only letting it have one eye!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, but it's because I don't consider myself a good enough lawyer yet, you see. Once I become a fully-fledged lawyer, Miss Susato will colour in the other eye for me.
Iris:
Well in that case, why not colour in the other eye now... ...and then every time you win a new case, give it an extra eye. You can never have too many eyes, you know.
Ryunosuke:
......... Call me crazy, but I'd never considered that.
Door
Ryunosuke:
Do you know, I've never seen inside Miss Susato's room? I haven't so much as put my head around the door.
Iris:
Oh, Susie often invites me up! It's so much fun!
Ryunosuke:
Really? ...What's her room like?
Iris:
I can't tell you that!
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Iris:
A young maiden's private chamber is a place of bitter-sweet secrets, you know!
Ryunosuke:
(...Where have I heard that before? I suppose some things are the same the world over.)
Aquarium
Ryunosuke:
We were rather lucky to find that old 'aquarium' left behind here. The prawns we put in there are doing rather well. And the anemones, too.
Iris:
Apparently, tanks like those were very popular in London before I was born.
Ryunosuke:
Oh. You mean they're not any more?
Iris:
I think people discovered it was too much effort to clean them out and change the water all the time.
Ryunosuke:
(I can believe that. Prawns and anemones are fun...for a while.)
Desk in front
Iris:
Oh? This looks like a telegram.
Ryunosuke:
It is. But you mustn't open it. Not under any circumstances!
Iris:
Alright, I won't! Now then, let's see...
Ryunosuke:
No! What did I just say?! You mustn't open it!
Iris:
Don't worry, I won't. With this special concoction I've developed, I'll be able to see through the envelope without having to open it.
Ryunosuke:
No! That's not allowed either!
Iris:
Oh... But I'm sure it's something important...
Ryunosuke:
(...Little geniuses sure can be mischievous.)

Events at Windibank's
Ryunosuke:
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Iris, but...Mr Windibank is dead.
Iris:
...!
Ryunosuke:
He was shot. We discovered it in the early hours of the morning.
Iris:
......... Oh. Yes, I had a feeling...
Ryunosuke:
You did?
Iris:
Well I saw all of those police carriages pulling up outside his shop. So I knew something must have happened there.
Ryunosuke:
......... When we entered Windibank's in the small hours, we disturbed a gang of two thugs. They ran out onto the street, and I chased after them, but... ...they got away.
Iris:
So...it was one of them who shot old Mr Windibank, I suppose.
Ryunosuke:
I don't know, but...that's not what the police believe at the moment.
Iris:
Oh! Why not?
Ryunosuke:
They've arrested someone else as their prime suspect, you see. ...Gina.
Iris:
G-Ginny?! But...why?!
Ryunosuke:
Well, the thing is...
Iris:
No! Ginny wouldn't do something like that!
Ryunosuke:
I know, I know! None of us think she did it.
Iris:
Then why have they arrested her?
Ryunosuke:
I'm sorry. There was nothing I could do...
Sholmes's situation
Iris:
So where's Hurley, then? Is he still there investigating the scene? He really ought to have some breakfast. It's not good for him to miss meals.
Ryunosuke:
......... I don't want you to worry, Iris, but I have some news about Mr Sholmes.
Iris:
...!
Ryunosuke:
He...was taken to hospital this morning.
Iris:
What?
Ryunosuke:
Well, um... ...when we entered Windibank's, a gun was fired, and...he took a bullet.
Iris:
H-Hurley...? Was shot...? N-No... No...
Ryunosuke:
It's, it's alright! His life isn't in danger!
Iris:
Really? Are you sure? ...Where is he? Which hospital?
Ryunosuke:
He's, he's at St Synner's. They're tending to him there.
Iris:
I must see him. ...At once!
Ryunosuke:
I'm sorry, Iris, but you can't.
Iris:
Why not?! That's not fair! I'm a family member! I should be allowed!
Ryunosuke:
No, I mean, nobody can see him at the moment. He's not allowed any visitors. They're preparing to operate, you see.
Iris:
To...to operate...? Oh, poor Hurley...
Changes "Sholmes's situation" Converse option to "Injured Sholmes"
Injured Sholmes
Ryunosuke:
It was the two thugs who were in Mr Windibank's shop. They shot Mr Sholmes when we disturbed them, you see.
Iris:
.........
Ryunosuke:
It was pitch-black inside the shop at the time. My mind went totally blank, I'm afraid. I, I just froze.
Sholmes:
After them! Go!
Ryunosuke:
After that, I ran out into the street, but... Well, they were long gone. I, I shouldn't have hesitated. I'm so sorry. It's my fault. I let them get away.
Iris:
......... I think...that's a very good thing.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Iris:
Well, if you'd seen which way they went and chased after them... ...you might have been shot as well, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Iris:
On top of everything else, I...I couldn't bear that.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, Iris...
Susato's situation
Iris:
Where's Susie, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
She's still at the police station.
Iris:
Oh! Why?
Ryunosuke:
I expect she's still being questioned. The police said they wouldn't be finished for a while.
Iris:
Why aren't you there then?
Ryunosuke:
Well, I didn't get a good look at the criminals, anyway. So they weren't questioning me for long. And Miss Susato stayed behind at the scene to tend to Mr Sholmes, so they didn't get started until later.
Iris:
Ah, I see.
Ryunosuke:
(Besides... ...one of us had to come back to be with Iris. I'm glad Inspector Gregson agreed to me leaving early.)
Iris:
...You should have let me know and I would have come to the station.
Gina's arrest (appears after "Events at Windibank's")
Iris:
I don't understand why they arrested Ginny. It's not fair! What about the two thugs that were at the scene? Why aren't they the prime suspects? After all... ...they shot Hurley dead, didn't they?
Ryunosuke:
No! I, I mean, Mr Sholmes isn't dead, Iris!
Iris:
Argh, this is all so horrible...
Ryunosuke:
The thing is, Mr Windibank was found on the floor in the storeroom where he keeps all the deposited articles. And the storeroom door was locked from the inside.
Iris:
I see...
Ryunosuke:
But he wasn't alone in there. ...Gina was found next to him on the floor as well.
Iris:
Oh no!
Ryunosuke:
And according to the detectives who investigated afterwards...
Iris:
Don't tell me. There was no one else in the room?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Exactly. How did you know?
Iris:
It's the only explanation.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...the only explanation, indeed.
Iris:
What do you mean by that, Runo?! Well?!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, what can I say? I'm damned if I agree, damned if I don't...)
After clearing all Converse options:
Ryunosuke:
I'm afraid I'll need to go out again now, Iris. There's not much I can do at the moment... But I can at least try to find out how Mr Sholmes and Gina are getting on.
Iris:
I want to go, too. Take me with you, Runo!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Iris:
I can't stand just sitting around here waiting.
Ryunosuke:
(I'm not sure how I feel about taking a ten-year-old child to the scene of a murder... But I don't want to leave her all alone here, either.) Alright then, Iris. Perhaps you can help me?
Iris:
Oh yes! I'd love to!
Ryunosuke:
Gina's at the prison. Mr Sholmes is...probably in his hospital bed.
Iris:
And don't forget we have to visit the crime scene! We need to conduct a thorough investigation!
Ryunosuke:
Ah, I can see you're ready for action! (I imagine Iris would appreciate going to the hospital sooner rather than later...)
Sholmes's Suite
Examine
Desk on left
Ryunosuke:
Look at Mr Sholmes's desk. It's completely clear. (It looks totally different without that enormous machine on it.)
Iris:
Hurley lives in an absolute mess all the time. He never notices when things go missing.
Ryunosuke:
...Even Mr Sholmes must have noticed that huge lump of metal is no longer there, surely.
Shelves on left
Ryunosuke:
There's all sorts on these shelves: chemistry apparatus, books, papers and...lots of things I've never seen before. It's all heaped up so high, I can't help feeling that the whole lot is going to topple at any moment. 
Iris:
Yes, Hurley does tend to overload the shelves.
Ryunosuke:
...That's one way of putting it.
Iris:
He wanted to look something up in one of those books the other day, you know. But it was so tightly crammed in, he gave up and went out to buy a brand new copy instead.
Initials on wall
Ryunosuke:
Ah yes, the letters 'V' and 'R' inscribed on the wall...in bullet holes. Isn't it the initials of the Queen or something?
Iris:
That's right. But Hurley isn't a very good shot, sadly. I can't remember how many times he had to replaster that patch of wall before he managed to make the letters!
Ryunosuke:
(...Is he a patriot or a plasterer?)
Violin
Ryunosuke:
Now this really is Mr Sholmes's faithful performing partner, then. The Stravidar... The Strappyscar... The Scrapifarious...? (No, it's no good. It's gone.) The virtuoso's violin that he found in a pawnbroker's and managed to buy for next to nothing.
Iris:
I hope Hurley gets well soon. I miss hearing his violin playing already.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, Iris, I'm sure he will.
Fireplace
Ryunosuke:
The fire's burning comfortingly in the grate again today. It's a very different feeling to a Japanese hibachi somehow. 
Iris:
Hurley's been working on his disguises recently. He's been dressing as a woman, mainly.
Ryunosuke:
...Really?! Mr Sholmes...dresses in women's clothes?
Iris:
Yes. You see the lady in that photographic print on the mantelpiece? That's Hurley!
Ryunosuke:
(...He's quite stunning...)
Chest
Ryunosuke:
It's an unusual way to make use of a huge metal chest. As a table for tea and coffee. But it is a very sturdy box. And I've noticed that it's always locked.
Iris:
Ah, well, that's because... ...that box contains some of my most important things!
Ryunosuke:
(Which you have no intention of telling me more about, judging from that guarded smile.)
Shelf to the right of fireplace
Ryunosuke:
These are all mementoes of Mr Sholmes's past cases, I think. If he'd been involved in my case, I wonder if the beef steak from La Carneval would be on display here... 
Iris:
Hurley says that Waggy is a memento, too.
Ryunosuke:
What? How?
Iris:
He tried really hard to get the little fellow to stay on those shelves at first. But he had to give up in the end. Waggy just wouldn't keep still.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...funny that.
Tea set on cart or table
Ryunosuke:
Your beautiful tea set is there on the table as usual. A cup of one of your special herbal blends always helps me to relax when I'm feeling the strain.
Iris:
Poor Hurley... He hasn't had a drop of tea today. I wish I could take some to the hospital for him.
Blackboard
Ryunosuke:
This is where you note down ideas, isn't it, Iris? Let's see...what does it say today? Ah, 'The Boscombe Valley Mystery'. 
Iris:
We visited Boscombe Valley recently for a picnic, you see. But I forgot to bring the tea. So when Hurley became thirsty, he decided to drink from Boscombe Pool. He gave himself an awful tummy ache.
Ryunosuke:
Oh dear...
Iris:
Hurley sat there miserable as can be in that field of flowers after that. Just like when you saw him yesterday.
Ryunosuke:
...That really is an unsavoury tale. 
White shelf behind chandelier
Ryunosuke:
That's a charming little white shelf. And full of charming little bottles, too. ...But the contents of them aren't quite so charming, it seems. 
Iris:
I'm so close now! I've nearly developed a rainbow smoke grenade, you know!
Ryunosuke:
So you're still working on those colourful but funny explosives, are you?
Iris:
I tell you what! When I've perfected it, I'll fire the first shot at you, Runo!
Ryunosuke:
...What an honour.
Typewriter or desk on right
Ryunosuke:
Come to think of it, I haven't seen you doing much writing recently, Iris. But there's paper already set up in the typewriter, I notice. As if you're about to start. 
Iris:
I'm a little stuck for a new story idea, actually.
Ryunosuke:
Well...you could consider using what happened to Mr Natsume, perhaps?
Iris:
Ooh, yes! That's a fabulous idea! And a great title has just popped into my head as well. 'The Adventure of the Catty Man'! How's that, Runo!
Baker Street
Examine
Pawnbrokery or carriage
Ryunosuke:
(There's still a Scotland Yard carriage outside Windibank's.)
Iris:
I never imagined we'd be investigating a case so close to home...
Ryunosuke:
(Poor Iris, she's very upset by all this.) I'm sorry. I was there. I should have done more...
Iris:
None of this is your fault, Runo. So please, don't apologise.
Ryunosuke:
But I...
Iris:
It's the criminals who are to blame for all this! So let's investigate and work out how to catch them!
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, you're right!
Sholmes' office
Ryunosuke:
It's already been two months that we've been taking lodgings here above Mr Sholmes's office. (I still can't quite believe it. I never expected things would turn out like this.)
Iris:
When Hurley comes back home, let's have a big party!
Ryunosuke:
That's a great idea. I'm sure it won't be long. Mr Sholmes is very tough.
Iris:
Yes!
16th April
St Synner's Hospital, Ward 3
Iris:
Hurley! ...Oh! He's not here!
Ryunosuke:
No. That's strange... The nurse definitely said he was in the bed by the window, didn't she?
Iris:
Ooh, I know what's probably happened! Hurley was being a big baby. And the bullet wound wasn't that bad after all so he's been sent home.
Ryunosuke:
Hm, I'm not so sure about that. Baby or not... ...there's no question that it was a fairly serious injury that Mr Sholmes suffered.
Iris:
Oh...
???:
'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere?
Bobby:
This ward is off limits! No visitin'! So what are you doin' in 'ere, eh?
Iris:
Well, I'll have you know, we're Hurley's next of kin!
Bobby:
Eh? ...Oh! Well beggin' your pardon then, ma'am. Sir. ...A little lady and a curious Eastern gentleman... The great mystery-solver 'as a mysterious family, eh.
Ryunosuke:
(...If that's how you see us, um...sure.)
Iris:
Where is he, Constable? Where's Hurley?
Bobby:
I believe 'e is currently in the operatin' theatre, ma'am. Undergoin' an extensive operation.
Iris:
Extensive?!
Bobby:
It 'as been several 'ours since 'e went in.
Iris:
Oh dear... Is he going to be alright?
Bobby:
Well, it doesn't appear to be workin', you see. The anaesthetic, that is.
Iris:
Oh!
Bobby:
I 'ave 'eard a report that the gentleman claims 'e may 'ave 'ad a little too much to drink last night. Coffee, that is.
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Bobby:
Anyway, I think it would be fair to assume that 'e won't be back 'ere for several 'ours yet.
Ryunosuke:
...I see. Thank you, Constable. Perhaps we should leave and come back later.
Iris:
Oh, poor Hurley...
Examine
Noticeboard on wall
Ryunosuke:
There's a noticeboard on the wall here, look. Let's see...what does it say...? 'Thought of the Day: On seeing any vermin, calmly and discreetly inform Matron.'
Iris:
Oh yes, they have rats and mice in hospitals like this that love to feast on all the medicine. If you don't deal with them, there's nothing left to treat the patients.
Ryunosuke:
Rats and mice? ...Oh, I see. (This IS a rather old building, I suppose.)
Iris:
But the doctors and nurses are all very good, I hear.
Ryunosuke:
I certainly hope so, for Mr Sholmes's sake.
Bed
Ryunosuke:
This must be Mr Sholmes's bed.
Iris:
Poor Hurley...
Ryunosuke:
I know. It looks a stiff as a board, doesn't it?
Iris:
Oh, I don't think that will bother him.
Ryunosuke:
No?
Iris:
I often find him asleep face down on the floor, completely dead to the world.
Ryunosuke:
...I think I'd call the police if I discovered someone like that.
Crutches
Ryunosuke:
I wonder what these are. Do you have any idea, Iris?
Iris:
Oh! Haven't you ever seen crutches before? Let me explain. They're for people with leg injuries, to help them walk. You hold one under each arm, you see.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...right. I thought they were weapons of some sort.
Iris:
Why would there be weapons in an hospital?
Ryunosuke:
I thought maybe a fighter had been injured in a battle contest and been brought here along with his weapons.
Iris:
......... That's...surprisingly plausible.
16th April
Windibank's Pawnbrokery
Iris:
This is where it happened, then? Last night.
Ryunosuke:
That's right. The two thugs I told you about were obviously ransacking the place, looking for valuables.
Iris:
But... ...apart from the policemen in here, you wouldn't know anything had happened. There's no sign of a disturbance.
Ryunosuke:
No...you're right about that, actually.
Iris:
In fact, if anyone, it's the police who seem to be the ones doing the ransacking.
Ryunosuke:
I know what you mean. They're like a gang of organised criminals, all dressed in black!
???:
Oi! I heard that!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, Inspector! Erm... Good morning.
Gregson:
Hmph. I s'pose I ought to thank you for your vigilance last night. We got to the scene before it was disturbed at least. Shame you let the two rogues get away, mind.
Ryunosuke:
Yes... I'm sorry about that.
Iris:
...I thought you'd assigned extra men to the beat around here, Gregsy. Now look what's happened! Hurley's been injured because there weren't enough police on duty!
Gregson:
.........Ah! Y...Y...Your Ladyship! No one told me you were comin'!
Iris:
I expect you to take full responsibility for what happened to Hurley and see he has the very best medical care!
Gregson:
Of course, Your Ladyship! The very best doctors in the capital are tendin' to him as we speak!
Iris:
And I don't think it's Runo's fault that the rogues managed to get away, is it? Chasing criminals is the police's job.
Gregson:
Absolutely, Your Ladyship! As you say, ma'am, as you say! The gent in black is totally blameless! Everyone's in agreement about that.
Ryunosuke:
(Would you believe it?! He's like a completely different person with Iris. Talk about a personality change...)
Gregson:
Oh! Where are me manners? Are you thirsty, Your Ladyship? Perhaps you'd like some juice? Some nice, refreshin' fruit juice?
Iris:
Oh, why? Are you thirsty, Gregsy? I have some of my special herbal tea with me, if you'd like some!
Gregson:
*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Ta very much. That really hit the spot...Your Ladyship.
Ryunosuke:
(I don't even recognise him like this...)
Examine
Bobby (left or center)
Ryunosuke:
(The police are scouring every inch of this place, by the look of it.)
Bobby:
Instructions from the Yard are to examine every article in the shop and every ledger and book of accounts.
Ryunosuke:
Every article?! But, but that's a ridiculous amount of work, surely?
Bobby:
We've been hard at it ever since the shop was declared a crime scene in the early hours. We're siftin' through it all in shifts at least, but still... ...we'll be workin' through the night, that's for sure. And even then we'll barely have scratched the surface.
Ryunosuke:
(A crime in a pawnbroker's... It must be every policeman's worst nightmare.)
Bobby:
It's every copper's worst nightmare, you know, a crime in a pawnbroker's.
Bobby (right)
Ryunosuke:
(This officer has been staring intently at the wall since before we came in here.)
Bobby:
Ssh! Keep it down!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! ...Sorry.
Bobby:
There's a major clue just 'ere.
Iris:
Really?! Then we must tell Gregsy at once!
Bobby:
But as soon as I report it, that'll be it. I'll be stuck 'ere even longer.
Ryunosuke:
Stuck here? What do you mean?
Bobby:
I 'aven't been 'ome in two days already! I need another constable to relieve me and take over me shift.
Ryunosuke:
Haah... (They really have a tough time, the British police.)
Iris:
That doesn't stop us from investigating, though, does it?
Ryunosuke:
No...I suppose not. (I'm fairly sure it was the calendar he was peering at...)
Anything else
Iris:
Alright then! Let's see what we can uncover!
Gregson:
Oi, what d'you think you're doin', sunshine? You can't touch anythin' in here.
Ryunosuke:
Oh... But, we were hoping to investigate.
Gregson:
This is a crime scene, for Pete's sake! No touchin'!
Iris:
What's the problem, Gregsy? Runo's a lawyer. You know that.
Gregson:
Oh, I'm ever so sorry, Your Ladyship. Ever so sorry! The rules and regulations are a thorn in my side! 'Course, if Mr Naruhodo was to have been properly appointed by the accused, that'd be another matter.
Ryunosuke:
The accused...?
Gregson:
If you could show me some representation papers, I'd be only too happy to let you nose around!
Iris:
Did you hear that, Runo? You need Ginny to sign some representation papers.
Ryunosuke:
(It looks like presenting the detective here with the correct paperwork is the only way...)
Anything else (subsequent times)
Iris:
So then...what have we here?
Gregson:
Now what did I tell you, eh, you black-haired blighter?! Hands off my crime scene, sunshine!
Ryunosuke:
...Her Ladyship can do no wrong, though, I suppose?
Gregson:
If you want to be allowed to investigate, I'm gonna need to see some representation papers, got it?
Ryunosuke:
(It looks like presenting the detective here with the correct paperwork is the only way...)
Iris:
Haah... Oh well...
Converse
The investigation
Ryunosuke:
So...how is the investigation going, Inspector?
Gregson:
Nothin' to it, really. Very simple case, this. There's some very definitive evidence. We're just about to charge that diver we arrested last night, in fact.
Ryunosuke:
Gina? You're, you're going to charge her?!
Gregson:
That's right. Should be able to bring her before the judge at the Bailey tomorrow.
Iris:
Definitive evidence, you say? What is it? Come on! Show me!
Gregson:
Your Ladyship, as, as much as I wish I could oblige you, I'm afraid...
Iris:
......... Ah, I see. You've already captured the pair of thugs who broke in here last night, have you?
Gregson:
What the-
Iris:
And you're going to put them on the stand as witnesses, are you?
Gregson:
How, how could you...? Hooooooooow?! How could you possibly know that?!
Iris:
...I had a feeling, that's all.
Ryunosuke:
(...Remind me never to try to keep a secret from Iris.) So you've arrested the two men who shot Mr Sholmes, have you?
Gregson:
Well...yes... They were rounded up pretty quickly by the lads on the beat.
Ryunosuke:
And Miss Lestrade is being held at the prison?
Gregson:
She should be. That's assumin' she hasn't lifted the key from the jailer, of course.
Mr Sholmes
Ryunosuke:
Can you tell us anything about Mr Sholmes? What's his condition?
Gregson:
Sorry, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information. Scotland Yard matters are strictly confidential.
Iris:
Well, I know he's being operated on at St Synner's. Why can't I see him? I'm family, you know!
Gregson:
I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Your Ladyship! It's the hospital's policy. No visitin' at all.
Iris:
Oh!
Gregson:
The bullet must've hit an artery in his midriff. He's lost a fair bit of blood.
Iris:
Oh no...
Gregson:
He didn't seem too bad in the first hour or so. But a haemorrhage like that is enough to make even the one and only Sholmes pipe down.
Ryunosuke:
...Mr Sholmes is a human like the rest of us, you know.
Gregson:
Well anyway, he's havin' emergency surgery right now. They've gotta stop that bleedin'.
Iris:
But...he will be alright, won't he? They'll be able to make him better?
Gregson:
Of, of course, Your Ladyship! He'll be as right as rain before you know it!
Iris:
Really?! ...How do you know?
Gregson:
Eh? How do I know? Well, um...erm...because...of course... Ah yes! Because Mr Sholmes is such a greeeeeeat detective, that's why!
Ryunosuke:
(...We'd better pray the doctors have a better grasp of what's needed to make someone well again.)
Iris:
Oh dear... Please don't die, Hurley...
Gregson:
I'll report to Your Ladyship the moment I hear he's out of the operatin' theatre!
Her Ladyship
Ryunosuke:
Um, I couldn't help noticing, Inspector...
Gregson:
What? Out with it, sunshine.
Ryunosuke:
Well, there seems to be...a marked difference between the way you talk to me and Iris.
Gregson:
Watch the sauce, sunny! I'm a copper, and we don't go in for favouritism!
Iris:
But he's right. You do treat us differently.
Gregson:
.........It's 'cause of those 'Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' stories, that's why.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Gregson:
I crop up in 'em, don't I? Inspector Tobias Gregson.
Iris:
Oh! Well yes, because you're an acquaintance of Hurley's.
Ryunosuke:
What did you write about the inspector, Iris?
Iris:
Hm...I don't remember, really.
Gregson:
It was one of Sholmes's lines. 'Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,' is how he put it.
Iris:
Oh, did I write that?!
Gregson:
And you know what that one line did for me?! Eh? The very next month my pay doubled! Doubled, I tell you!
Ryunosuke:
Ooh... That's amazing.
Gregson:
All because everyone at the Yard reads 'em. They read all the Herlock Sholmes stories. They've even set up a fan club for me!
Iris:
Of course, that explains everything. It was around that time that you became such a toady to me.
Gregson:
Can you blame me? All it'd take is one bad word from you and Sholmes could change his tune about me. 'Gregson? ...No,' the great detective will say. 'He's gettin' quite overrated these days!' Think what would happen to my salary if that came out in print, eh? The whole thing gives me the willies. I can't tell you how many nights of sleep I've lost to worryin' about it!
Iris:
But that would never happen, Gregsy.
Gregson:
Every month when the new Randst Magazine comes out, my hands are tremblin' as I turn the pages.
Iris:
Oh, how awful for you! Here, have some of my tea to settle your nerves!
Gregson:
*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Ta very much. That really hit the spot...Your Ladyship.
Ryunosuke:
(...Tea toadal.)
Present
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Inspector Gregson, could you give me your opinion about this, do you think?
Gregson:
We don't tend to share, sunshine. Not with the general public.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Iris:
In that case, Gregsy, how about some herbal tea?
Gregson:
*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Ta very much. That really hit the spot...Your Ladyship.
Ryunosuke:
(You don't mind sharing that then...)
After clearing all Converse options:
Gregson:
Oh...yeah...there's somethin' I was s'posed to talk to you about, actually, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes? What is it?
Gregson:
I've got an important message for you. I clean forgot about it until now.
Ryunosuke:
An important message? (I wonder what it could be...)
Converse
Important message
Ryunosuke:
Are you going to tell me what this important message is then, Inspector?
Gregson:
Yeah, it's about that young lady who's normally by your side. Your assistant.
Iris:
Dear Susie! Is she alright?
Ryunosuke:
She's at the station, isn't she? Being questioned, I believe.
Gregson:
Nope, not any more. She had to head off.
Ryunosuke:
Head off? Where?
Gregson:
To Lord Stronghart's office, of course. He summoned her.
Ryunosuke:
Ah... (Yes, of course. I'd forgotten about that.)
Gregson:
One of the whipstocks took her there in a Yard carriage after we'd finished questioning her. But she asked us to tell you she didn't have the fare for the return journey and to go and meet her there. ...She's got a nerve, usin' Scotland Yard as a bloomin' messagin' service!
Ryunosuke:
I see. Well, thank you for passing that on, Inspector.
Iris:
Why did Susie have to go to see the Lord Chief Justice?
Ryunosuke:
She...didn't tell me. (But I'd better head over to the Lord Chief Justice's office to fetch her straight away.)

Ryunosuke:
(Yes... ...no matter how many times I come here, I always get the same sense of oppressiveness somehow...)
Iris:
Do you think the place is oppressive? I think it's normal.
Ryunosuke:
How so?!
Iris:
I mean, look at that suit of armour over there. You can't take that seriously, can you?
Ryunosuke:
...Maybe it thinks the same about you.
???:
...So everything is clear with regard to tomorrow's arrangements, I trust?
???:
Yes. Thank you very much.
Ryunosuke:
(There they are. Susato-san and Lord Stronghart.)
Iris:
I wonder what they're talking about. They both look very serious.
Stronghart:
Very good. There is nothing further to discuss. You may return to your lodgings. No doubt you have much to do in preparation for your return to your homeland.
Ryunosuke:
......... (...Wait, what did he just say? 'Your return to your homeland'...?) Susato-san!
Susato:
...! Oh! Um...Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
......... What was all that about?
Susato:
.........
Stronghart:
Ah, Mr Naruhodo. Thank you for coming to collect your colleague.
Ryunosuke:
What's this all about? Why were you talking about Miss Susato's 'return to her homeland'? And, and... ...tomorrow?!
Susato:
.........
Iris:
Tomorrow...? But what about Ginny's trial?
Susato:
...! You mean... ...she's been formally charged now? Oh dear...
Iris:

Examine
Bookshelves
Iris:
Oh my goodness! Just look at all these books!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, there are books about the judicial systems of all different Western nations.
Iris:
Hm, even for someone like me... ...it would take at least ten days to read all of these.
Ryunosuke:
Just ten days?!
Iris:
...! Oh, I was only joking, Runo! I thought it would be fun to play up my genius!
Ryunosuke:
(It's scarily believable with you, that's the trouble.)
Armor
Ryunosuke:
Those giant suits of armour are still facing each other menacingly across the room.
Iris:
I just can't understand why anyone would wear things like that in battle. They must be so heavy.
Ryunosuke:
I expect you'd invent some special lightweight suit if it was down to you, wouldn't you, Iris?
Iris:
Hm... I think if it was me... ...I'd invent a world where people didn't need to fight each other in the first place.
Ryunosuke:
......... (Iris, you're a champion.)
Iris:
Well? What do you think? That was a model answer, wasn't it?
Ryunosuke:
(She's ten, Ryunosuke. Ten. And she's leading you around by the nose.)
Gears
Iris:
I love clocks and their mechanisms, don't you? The way all the hundreds of pieces fit together and work as one to move the hands of a single timepiece...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I can imagine clocks are just your cup of tea.
Iris:
When I was little, I used to dream of one day living inside a clock, you know.
Ryunosuke:
Then you must be envious of the Lord Chief Justice having his office in a place like this, I suppose.
Iris:
Hm... No, not really.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Iris:
Well I mean, that's a dream for when you're little. It'd be silly now.
Ryunosuke:
(...Don't let Lord Stronghart hear you talking like that.)
Chair or desk
Iris:
Ooh, I've always dreamt of sitting at a huge desk like that and looking important!
Ryunosuke:
Why don't you try it, then? ...Discreetly, of course.
Iris:
Alright, I will! Tell me how I look!
...Well, Runo? What do you think?
Ryunosuke:
......... A little too discreet. I can't even see you.
Converse
Returning to our homeland
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato! What's all this about?
Susato:
Oh... Please don't concern yourself, Mr Naruhodo. It's only me going back to Japan. Your life here can continue just as it has-
Ryunosuke:
That's not what I asked!
Susato:
...!
Ryunosuke:
What happened? Why are you leaving?
Susato:
......... It's my father... He's fallen ill.
Iris:
Oh no!
Ryunosuke:
Professor Mikotoba?
???:
If I may...?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, sorry?
???:
You must be the defendant. Ryunosuke Naruhodo, I believe?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! Yes, that's right!
Mikotoba:
My name is Yujin Mikotoba. I'm a professor of forensic medicine at Yumei University.
Stronghart:
We received an international telegram from the Empire of Japan informing us of the news.
Susato:
Ten days ago...Father collapsed with a fever. The cause is apparently unknown. And it seems he grows weaker day by day.
Ryunosuke:
I, I don't believe it...
Stronghart:
As you are aware, the voyage from here to your country's capital, Tokyo, takes some fifty days. I thought it would be prudent to hasten Miss Susato's departure as much as possible.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...absolutely...
Susato:
......... I will leave London first thing tomorrow morning.
Ryunosuke:
(I can't believe this is happening...)
Gina's trial
Susato:
So Gina has been charged? She'll have to appear in court?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, she was formally charged a few hours ago. And the date of the trial has already been set for tomorrow.
Susato:
No! Not even twenty-four hours later?
Stronghart:
Gina...? Ah, the Lestrade girl and the murder of the Baker Street pawnbroker, yes. An all too transpicuous case. The pickpocket was clearly disturbed mid-robbery and shot the man in a panic. No, the Yard is overstretched as it is, without wasting time on these open-and-shut cases.
Iris:
It's not wasting time! Ginny would never do something like that.
Stronghart:
......... Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, um...yes, Lord Stronghart?
Stronghart:
In deference of your fine services to date, I shall overlook this young girl's insolence. But I have no recollection of admitting a child into my office. ...Leave. Now.
Iris:
...!
Susato:
Of course, Lord Stronghart.
Stronghart:
...Criminals will tell the most palpable lies in order to evade justice. The police can ill afford the time it takes to unravel all their untruths. Meanwhile more crimes are perpetrated. We have far more serious matters with which to contend.
Ryunosuke:
Serious matters? (Didn't Gregson mention something like that yesterday?)
Susato:
Yes. Inspector Gregson made a similar remark yesterday.
Stronghart:
It's no concern of yours. Though I'm sure I need not remind you of that.
After clearing all Converse options:
Stronghart:
...Three minutes precisely until my next meeting. You must excuse me.
Ryunosuke:
......... There's just...one more thing, Lord Stronghart.
Stronghart:
Which is?
Ryunosuke:
It's Miss Lestrade's trial... I wonder if you might permit me to defend her?
Stronghart:
......... A timely suggestion.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Stronghart:
The girl currently has no representation.
Iris:
But, but that's not fair! Yes, she may be a pickpocket, but she still deserves a fair trial!
Stronghart:
...Do not misunderstand me, young lady. The government provides for those too poor to afford representation with a public defender. The accused need only sign the relevant paperwork, and a defence barrister will be assigned to the case. However...the young girl in question has refused that right.
Ryunosuke:
Why would she do that?
Stronghart:
A question you would do well to direct at Miss Lestrade. You'll find her at the local prison.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, thank you.
Stronghart:
Now then, it's time I was leaving. Good day to you.
Ryunosuke:
(What a day. Gina charged with murder... Susato-san about to leave...)
Susato:
......... Come, Mr Naruhodo. Iris. We must make haste.
Iris:
But, Susie... ...you're leaving for Japan tomorrow morning, aren't you? Don't you have packing and things to do?
Susato:
......... As Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant, my personal circumstances are of no consequence. My sole purpose remains to help you in whatever way I can.
Ryunosuke:
...Thank you, Miss Susato. (That's a very pensive look...)

Ginny...
Ryunosuke:
I have a feeling it's because of us that you've ended up in trouble. So we were thinking that we might be able to help you.
Gina:
...! Well you can't!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gina:
You 'eard! Get lost!
Iris:
Don't be like that, Ginny. I know you didn't do it. You'd never shoot someone. I just know you wouldn't!
Gina:
You think you know me? Pull the other one!
Iris:
Oh...
Gina:
You ain't got the first idea about the likes o' me. I'm a thief! I pinch people's purses when they're walkin' down the street. That's 'ow I get by. And if I saw me chance, I'd sneak into a pawn shop any day o' the week. Just to see wot I could lay me 'ands on! ...Get it? That's the kind o' person I am!
Iris:
But, but Ginny...
Gina:
I'll be in court tomorra, they said. Some cove came by before and said he'd be a lawyer for me or the like. Said it was my right or somefin'. But I told 'im to get stuffed. I don't need no lawyer! I don't need no one!
Ryunosuke:
(She couldn't be staring at me any more obviously if she tried...)
Iris:
Why are you being like this, Ginny?
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Ouch... That is one stern look Susato-san is giving Gina.)

Hello again, Gina.
Gina:
Wot are you lot 'ere for now?
Ryunosuke:
(...To have the muzzle of that grenade launcher shoved in our faces yet again, obviously.)
Iris:
Hm...I think I need to improve the way you load ammunition into that thing, don't I?
Gina:
Look! You can come as many times as ya like, but I ain't got nuffin' more to say to you!

Legal representation
Ryunosuke:
I don't understand, Gina. Why did you send the public defender away?
Gina:
'E wanted me to sign some papers. 'Representation papers' or somefin' like that. It's all gonna be rigged anyway. The whole trial. They'll pin it on me cos I'm a kid. That's wot grown-ups always do.
Iris:
Why do you think that?
Gina:
Cos that's 'ow it's always been for me, growin' up in the back slums. Me whole life. If you do wot the grown-ups tell ya, it'll get yer mates dragged off by the coppers. Or worse. I've 'ad it 'appen to me before an' all. Been sold out an' nearly snaffled on the back of it. You can't trust no one, that's the point. Soon as you do...yer gone to grass. Dead.
Ryunosuke:
......... Gina, listen... ...if you like, in tomorrow's trial, I could-
Gina:
Forget it.
Iris:
Ginny! Don't you trust Runo?
Gina:
......... Nah, I don't.
Iris:
...!
Gina:
Look, I'll ask ya nicely now... Just leave me alone!
What happened
Ryunosuke:
Will you tell us what happened, Gina? Last night...at the pawnbroker's.
Gina:
......... There's nuffin' to tell. I figured it'd pay me, so I broke into the place and started goin' through the storeroom. But the old bloke walked in on me and...you know the rest.
Iris:
But why, Ginny? Why would you do that?
Gina:
Ain't it obvious? The place is full o' stuff I could sell for a shillin' or two. Divin' ain't easy, you know. It's a lot o' work, and 'alf the time you don't even get nuffin'.
Ryunosuke:
......... Is that really why you broke into the place?
Gina:
......... Wot?
Ryunosuke:
Are you sure the true reason wasn't something else?
Gina:
Oh give it a rest! Wot'd be the point anyway?! Eh? Nuffin' I could say would make a blind bit o' difference!
Iris:
Please tell us, Ginny. We'll believe you. Whatever it is.
Gina:
Believe me? Don't be daft! You can't believe nuffin'! Everyone lies all the time. An' you know wot? When it comes to liars...I'm the biggest o' the lot! I've...I've told some unforgivable lies, I 'ave!
Iris:
Wh-What do you mean by that? What unforgivable lies?
Gina:
.........
Unforgivable lies (appears after "What happened")
Ryunosuke:
What did you mean before, Gina, when you said you were the biggest liar of the lot?
Gina:

Why don't you tell us what these unforgivable lies you've told are? Maybe we can help.
Gina:
......... Sorry... ...we're out o' time. They're gonna wanna question me now.
Iris:
Ginny, please...
Gina:
...Oh, yeah... I wanted to give you this. Somefin' to remember me by.
Ryunosuke:
A photographic print? (...Of a really adorable cat.)
Gina:
I found it in one o' the pockets o' this coat. Ain't no point me 'avin' it.
Iris:
I wonder what a little photograph like that was doing in a pocket of that overcoat...
Gina:
......... Anyway, don't bother comin' again. ...Bye.
Iris:
Oh, Ginny...

White Cat Photograph
Ryunosuke:
Gina, about this photograph...
Gina:
Oh that? I just found it in one of the pockets o' this coat, that's all. Chuck it if you don't want it.
Ryunosuke:
(So McGilded didn't give it to her...?)
Gina:
There's summat written on the back, I think.
Ryunosuke:
There is?!
Gina:
Don't mean nuffin' to me, though. I don't read so well anyway, 'specially not that scrawl.
Ryunosuke:
(I really ought to examine the photograph more thoroughly, I think.)
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Here, Gina, look at this.
Gina:
No ta.
Ryunosuke:
I, I wasn't saying you could have it!
Gina:
Oh! Weren't ya? Well when someone says I can't 'ave stuff, it makes me want it, see. So you better 'and it over now.
Ryunosuke:
No! I'm not giving it to you!

White Cat Photograph
Side with photo of cat
Ryunosuke:
This is an adorable little cat. I think it looks a little like Wagahai. I always thought that cats liked to curl up inside under the heated kotatsu blanket when it snowed. ...Maybe British cats are different.
Side with writing (before clearing all Converse options at Lord Chief Justice's Office)
Ryunosuke:
Look on the back of this print here! There's something written on it!
Iris:
'13th February, 9:00 p.m.
Article deposited: One small box
Loan amount paid: 10 shillings
Redemption deadline: 13th April, 9:00 p.m.'
Ryunosuke:
So this photographic print is a redemption ticket?
Iris:
13th February? That could be significant. It was just two days before the murder on the omnibus, wasn't it?
Ryunosuke:
A small box... That doesn't tell us much about it, does it?
Iris:
Runo...if Mr McGilded still had the ticket, then presumably he never redeemed the article. So do you think the box might still be present somewhere in the shop?
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Yes! (If it's something McGilded deposited, we need to investigate!)

Redemption deadline: 13th April, 9:00 p.m.'
Ryunosuke:
So this photographic print is a redemption ticket?
Susato:
For an article that was deposited two days prior to the incident on the omnibus, it would seem.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, a small box... That doesn't tell us much about it, does it?
Iris:
Perhaps it contained some valuable mementoes?
Susato:
I can't help wondering... Presumably Mr McGilded never redeemed the article in question, since he still had the ticket. So isn't it possible that the box is still present somewhere in the shop?
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Yes! (If it's something McGilded deposited, we need to investigate!)

Side with writing (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
Mr Windibank appears to have used the back of this photograph to write out a redemption ticket. He's written it very neatly, but still. Perhaps he ran out of paper, so had to use anything he had to hand. It's hard to know what's the front and what's the reverse side now...
After clearing all Converse options at Local Prison, Cell 13 and Lord Chief Justice's Office:
Susato:
Gina... ...I wonder if you might hear me out. There's something I'd like to say.
Gina:
Wot?
Susato:
I'm sorry to say...that I must reluctantly bid you farewell.
Gina:
Eh? Farewell?
Susato:
Tomorrow, I must begin my journey back home. To Japan. ...I fear we may never meet again.
Gina:
...! Oh...right...
Susato:
I've had the pleasure of meeting so many lovely people here in London. I have so many wonderful memories. And yet...as things stand now... ...it will be a glum parting indeed. Poor Iris is so miserable.
Iris:
Susie...
Gina:
Well...well...that ain't my business!
Susato:
Both Iris and Mr Naruhodo believe you to be innocent, Gina. They've put their faith in you. But somehow...you can't find it in your heart to put your faith in them.
Gina:
Yeah! That's right, I can't! ...Wot of it?
Susato:
It grieves me greatly to have to say goodbye to my friends when they are so clearly unhappy... ...because of you.
Gina:
...! Wot, it's MY fault?!
Susato:
Yes. So I have one final request, Gina, before our paths never cross again. Right here and now... ...I want you to show both of them that you don't deserve the faith they've invested in you.
Gina:
Eh?!
Susato:
Only by doing that... ...will you truly be as alone as you claim to be.
Gina:
...! Wot are you talkin' about? Wot d'you expect me to do, eh?
Susato:
You've told us that everyone lies. So prove it! ...By admitting one of your own untruths.
Gina:
.........
Iris:
What about what you said before, Ginny? You said something about unforgivable lies.
Susato:
You must tell Mr Naruhodo and Iris the truth now. That is my last request before I leave. My last request as a judicial assistant.
Gina:
No... I, I can't...
Ryunosuke:
(Whatever these lies are, they're obviously weighing very heavily on Gina's mind...) Gina, I could be wrong, but... ...is it something to do with what happened two months ago? Something about that trial?
The one in which Magnus McGilded was acquitted?
Gina:
Ah...
Ryunosuke:
The case of that mysterious murder that took place inside the omnibus... You were called as a witness by the prosecution. Is that what this is about?
Gina:
......... Yeah. You're right. Because...in that trial... ...I lied. I lied like you wouldn't believe.
Ryunosuke:
......... Will you tell us about it now?
Gina:
.........
Converse
The trial two months ago
Gina:
Like you said, it all 'appened two months ago. The coppers got 'old o' me and shoved me in the witness stand.
Ryunosuke:
And based on your testimony, Mr McGilded was declared innocent.
Gina:
Yeah, well...the thing is...I lied about a whole bunch o' stuff.
Ryunosuke:
(I knew it.)
Susato:
What sort of thing did you lie about?
Gina:
......... I was 'idin' under the seat that night. That was the truth. It was pitch-black in that little cubbyhole. I couldn't see a thing. And then...
*Thud!*
Gina:
...I 'eard that loud thud. Like someone fallin' on the floor.
Ryunosuke:
And that's when Mr McGilded discovered you?
Gina:
Yeah... 'E pulled me out from under the seat and sat me next to the dead man. There weren't much light to see by, but when I looked at me 'ands, I 'ad the cove's blood all over 'em. I was so scared, I couldn't even speak.
Ryunosuke:
You had his blood on your hands? (In other words... ...it was Gina that the witnesses on the roof deck saw through the skylight.)
Gina:
.........
Susato:
Then Mr McGilded started asking you questions, I suppose? Who you were...and why you were hiding under the seat.
Gina:
Yeah, 'e did. Only...that's not all.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Gina:
I mean 'e threatened me.
Ryunosuke:
Threatened you how?
Gina:
'E made me swear. About wot I'd seen and wot I'd 'eard. And about wot 'e was gonna do after the cove was found dead. 'E made me swear I wouldn't tell no one about any of it. If I did that, 'e said 'e'd let me scarper before the coppers showed up. .........
Ryunosuke:
Gina, you must tell me what he swore you to secrecy about! What you saw...what you heard...everything!
Gina:
.........
What you saw (appears after "The trial two months ago")
Ryunosuke:
You said McGilded made you swear not to tell anybody what you saw... ...but you were in the pitch-black compartment under the seat the whole time, weren't you?
Susato:
Yes, with Mr McGilded sitting above your head, if I remember correctly.
Gina:
Yeah, that's true, but... ...it was when I 'eard the thud of the cove 'ittin' the floor. I let out a little scream, see. Couldn't 'elp it. McGilded 'eard that and dragged me out by me arm. And that's when I saw it. It was on the floor next to the old geezer wot 'ad been stabbed. A disk, all bright and shiny.
Susato:
A disk?
Ryunosuke:
Do you mean...?
Gina:
Yeah, that's it. The one wot the dee took off me at Windibank's.
Ryunosuke:
So the music box disk was there, on the floor of the omnibus...?
Gina:
Not for long. McGilded spotted it straight away. 'E picked it up smartish an' stuffed it in 'is inside pocket.
Ryunosuke:
So that disk... ...was in the omnibus two months ago, at the scene of Mr Mason's murder.
Gina:
And the bogtrotter told me... ...I weren't to mutter a word of it to no one.

What you heard (appears after "The trial two months ago")
Gina:
Cos it was so dark under that seat in the cab... ...I was strainin' me ears the whole time. After a while, I 'eard the door and footsteps inside the cabin.
Ryunosuke:
Presumably that was McGilded getting on board.
Gina:
Nah, not only 'im.
Ryunosuke:
Oh!
Gina:
Cos I could definitely make out the footsteps of two people.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Susato:
In that case, it would seem likely that it was Mr McGilded and the victim.
Ryunosuke:
(Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason...)
Susato:
In his testimony during the trial, Mr McGilded claimed he slept during the carriage ride.
McGilded:
But whenever I'm in a carriage, I'm taken with a fierce tiredness, and I always succumb to it.
Susato:
And your own testimony, Gina, supported this.
Gina:
All I could 'ear was the Irishman snorin'.
Gina:
......... Yeah, that weren't exactly true. Neither of 'em was asleep. I could 'ear 'em talkin' the whole time, in low voices.
Ryunosuke:
What?! What, what were they talking about?
Gina:
Sorry, I dunno. The sound o' the 'orses an' the wheels was too loud.
Susato:
But that still tells us something. Mr McGilded and the victim knew each other.
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(So McGilded was lying, as I suspected.)

After the event (appears after "The trial two months ago")
Gina:
I knew it weren't gonna take long before someone raised the alarm that the bloke 'ad been killed.
Susato:
Yes, you were quite right. The other passengers, on the roof deck, noticed very quickly.
Gina:
So when the cab came to a stop, McGilded told me to 'ide back under the seat again. I climbed in and waited. The two coves from up top ran off to get the coppers.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, um...Mr Fairplay and Mr Furst.
Gina:
Right. An' after they'd gone, McGilded asked the driver to do 'im a favour.
Ryunosuke:
A favour?
McGilded:
Now then, fella...what I need ye to do is take this coat of mine and deposit it with a nearby pawnbroker. And for yer troubles, let's see now... Aye, I'll give ye ten guineas.
Ryunosuke:
A nearby pawnbroker! You mean, on Baker Street?
Gina:
Yup, you got it. It was Windibank's. The coachy snapped up the money an' ran off to pop this coat as fast as 'e could. So then there was no one left in the carriage. McGilded opened the box under the seat... ...and let me get outta there. But not wivout conditions.
Susato:
I see...

Ryunosuke:
What were McGilded's conditions then? For letting you go free, I mean.
Gina:
......... Not tellin' a soul. Not for anyfin'. About wot I saw and wot I 'eard. And...there was somefin' else as well...
Ryunosuke:
...! There's more?!
Gina:
Yeah... 'This is the most important ting,' 'e said.
McGilded:
I'm after sendin' the coachman on a little errand for me, with some small change in his hand. Now then...did ye hear what I asked of him? Did ye see anythin' at all, at all?
Gina:
...You asked 'im to go pop yer weasel, right?
McGilded:
Aye... The feen's taken me overcoat to deposit with a pawnbroker hereabouts. And I want you, lass, to take the redemption ticket for it. D'ye understand?
Gina:
Wot? You want me to 'ave the ticket?
McGilded:
That's right. And I'll come fetch it from ye later. Sometime within the next two months. Yer to hang on to it until then. Is that clear? ...And whatever ye do, don't lose it!
Gina:
...Alright then.
McGilded:
And in case I might happen to be delayed at all... ...yer to go to the pawn shop - Windibank's, so it is - and yer to extend the loan afore the two months is up. If ye forget, the article will be forfeited and any old feen could come along and buy it.
Gina:
Eh? But, but I ain't got that kind o' brass.
McGilded:
Here's five pounds. ...That should be enough.
Gina:
.........
McGilded:
Do we understand each other, lass? Don't try anytin' funny now. If you go against me...
Gina:
Yeah, I get it.
McGilded:
Good. And one more ting... ...in a few days from now, ye'll be visited by the police, I've no doubt.
Gina:
The coppers?!
McGilded:
Aye. They'll come askin' ye to take the stand in court. To testify as a witness. So let's just have a wee chat about that, shall we? What it is that ye might say... And what it is that ye won't.
......................................................
Gina:
After 'e'd gone over it all, I piked it. Got as far away from there as I could. 'E 'id the pawnbroker's ticket in some bushes near the scene. I went to fetch it the next day once it got dark.
Ryunosuke:
(So McGilded planned it... ...and coerced Gina into giving false testimony.)
Susato:
.........
After clearing all Converse options:
Gina:
......... I bet yer ready to string me up, eh? I lied...in that big old courtroom. I told some corkers.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Gina:
The thing is, 'e said 'e would make it so we couldn't live in the East End no more. That's wot 'e threatened me wiv.
Iris:
What a wicked man...
Gina:
'E knew everyfin' wot went on in the back slums. 'E knew we 'ad no one to look after us, and we was all just lookin' out for each other, gettin' by together.
Susato:
So you mean...Mr McGilded would have-
Gina:
In an 'eartbeat! 'E could've 'ad the lot of us chased out o' there if 'e'd wanted. And then where could we 'ave gone, eh? Nowhere, that's where! So... I didn't 'ave no choice. .........
Ryunosuke:
Thank you, Gina, for telling us everything.
Gina:
But...I'm for it now, eh?! Go on, admit it! You must be livid!
Ryunosuke:
Well...you can make amends by doing me a simple favour.
Gina:
...A favour? Wot?
Ryunosuke:
Sign the representation papers for tomorrow's trial.
Gina:
Eh?!
Ryunosuke:
If you don't actually want me to represent you in court, you can rip it up later. But we need that paperwork or we can't investigate. The police won't let us.
Gina:
Investigate wot?
Ryunosuke:
The scene of the incident last night. Mr Sholmes was shot, you see.
Gina:
You wot?!
Iris:
Hurley's having a big operation right now, Ginny.
Gina:
Is it bad?! Is, is 'e gonna be alright? Sholmes is gonna be alright...right?
Iris:
.........
Ryunosuke:
That's why I want to investigate. For Mr Sholmes's sake as much as anything.
Gina:
......... Right. So wot yer sayin' is, if I sign that bit o' paper, everyone's 'appy, is that it?
Ryunosuke:
Something like that. ...Miss Susato?
Susato:
Yes! Of course! I have the representation papers here.
Gina:
......... ...I, I don't need no one to stick up for me, though. No lawyer or nuffin'.
Iris:
Poor Ginny... She seems so lonely.
Gina's representation papers have been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
Well...at least this should mean we can investigate the scene at Windibank's now.
Iris:
Yes. And perhaps we can come back to visit Ginny when we're done there?
Ryunosuke:
(I feel like we've finally cracked Gina. She's opened up to us at last. And now I have her representation papers... No one else knows just what a responsibility that is. Anyway, for now it means Inspector Gregson can't stop us investigating at Windibank's. Although something tells me he's not going to be happy about it...)
To be continued...

Windibank's Pawnbrokery
Ryunosuke:
(Here we are again at the scene of the crime... Now to thrust these representation papers in Gregson's face and see what he makes of them!) Hello again, Inspector. Do you have a minute, please?
Gregson:
What is it now? You should go home and get some rest.
Iris:
Here you are, Gregsy! Here are the representation papers!
Gregson:
.........Your Ladyship! Hooooooooooooooooooooow?! I don't believe it! How the devil did you get that stubborn little ragabash to sign that?! I salute you! That is good work, that is.
Iris:
I can see you've been very busy here as well. How about some tea? It's a special blend designed to relieve fatigue!
Gregson:
*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Well, let's see now... Yes... Yes! I hardly feel tired at all! I'm fit as a fiddle, Your Ladyship!
Ryunosuke:
...Would it be alright if we investigated the scene of the crime, then?
Gregson:
Do as you please! You know where it happened. Through that door behind the counter.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, the storeroom... That's where I discovered Mr Windibank...and Gina.)
Gregson:
Right, well...I'll be gettin' back to business then.
Ryunosuke:
Will you be investigating in the storeroom as well, Inspector?
Gregson:
If I'm perfectly honest, we need to wrap this up before long. Can't afford to spend too much time on it. But there are so many articles to go through, it's taking forever, even with the lads workin' round the clock. Which is a problem, 'cause there's another case the Yard needs to investigate urgently.
Ryunosuke:
(That must be what Lord Stronghart meant by 'far more serious matters' before...)
Gregson:
So what I'm sayin' is, don't get under my feet, sunshine!
Susato:
Come then! Let us not waste any time!
Examine
Counter
Ryunosuke:
There's the article ledger here, and Mr Windibank's notes, and...hm? What's this? It looks as though someone has left a little photographic print behind.
Susato:
Oh! Look on the back! There's some writing.
Iris:
Is there? Ooh, show us, Susie! Show us!
Susato:
'15th February, 10:30 p.m.
Article deposited: One gentleman's overcoat
Loan amount paid: 1 pound
Redemption deadline: 15th April, 10:30 p.m.'
Ryunosuke:
A gentleman's overcoat pawned for a pound? Clearly it was a very fine coat. In fact, I think...
Iris:
Yes! This must be the ticket for the overcoat that Ginny redeemed yesterday!
Ryunosuke:
...And is still wearing. (...Which belonged to McGilded. I would never have expected the redemption ticket to be handwritten on the back of a photograph, though.)
Iris:
It seems Mr Windibank just used whatever piece of paper he happened to have to hand.
Ryunosuke:
But this photograph of a cat... It looks very familiar, doesn't it? I'm sure I've seen this exact same picture somewhere else recently.
Iris:
Oh! Yes, you're right! Very recently! It's the same as the one Ginny gave us earlier.
Ryunosuke:
Of course! I was forgetting that she gave us that print!
Susato:
Well what are you waiting for then, Mr Naruhodo?! Get it out!
Ryunosuke:
(Alright, alright, let the cogs turn...)
Susato:
Yes...they are exactly the same!
If side with writing on White Cat Photograph has not been examined yet
Ryunosuke:
(Well if the one on the counter was used as a redemption ticket... ...perhaps the other photograph that Gina gave us has something written on the back, too.)
Iris:
......... Hehe, I've got it! These two photographs hide an amaaazing secret!
Ryunosuke:
A secret? (What does she mean?)
Susato:
You must tell us, Iris! At once!
Iris:
Hehe, do you really, really, really want to know?
Ryunosuke:
(Yes! We need you to tell us all you know about this pair of photographs!)
Counter (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
That ledger that's open on the counter there really is enormous, isn't it? It must be an awful lot of work to keep track of all these hundreds of items in pawn.
Iris:
It's too much to think about. Better to sell it all and have a clear head if you ask me!
Ryunosuke:
(But clearly Mr Windibank was very careful when it came to the articles in his care.)
Side door
Iris:
Behind that door... ...is the storeroom, isn't it? That's what Gregsy said.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, and that's where I saw that dreadful scene last night... ...through the little window in the door. Mr Windibank, face down on the floor, with Gina beside him..)
Susato:
As the accused's legal representative, you have the right to examine the scene, Mr Naruhodo. We must make a thorough investigation!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course. And we will. (Behind that door, that's...that's the real scene of the crime.)
Iris:
Don't worry! If there are clues in there, I'll find them!

Music box
Iris:
That's a music box. Do you have them where you come from, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, but...I've never seen one as large as this in Japan.
Iris:
Oh, well, this will be a treat! Shall we have a listen?
.........
Iris:
What do you think? Isn't it a pretty sound?
Ryunosuke:
It's a beautiful sound, yes, but... ...it's a little hard to enjoy when all the policemen in the room are giving you fierce looks.
Iris:
Never mind that! If any of them say anything, I'll tell Gregsy to have a word.
Ryunosuke:
(...Iris Wilson, Superintendent of Scotland Yard...)
Shelves (before presenting Pawnbroker's Ticket (Box) in Windibank's Storeroom)
Iris:
These shelves are where the pawnbroker puts articles that have been forfeited on display for customers to buy.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it's a really strange miscellany, isn't it? I mean, who would buy this horse statue, for example?
Iris:
Well...sometimes you can find some real treasures among all the junk, you know.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Iris:
Are you alright, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, it's just... Well, it looks like a collection of useless junk as a whole, but when you pick out individual things... ...you can't help wishing you owned them. Even that horse statue.
Iris:
That's exactly how the pawnbroker works. They're very clever.
Shelves (after presenting Pawnbroker's Ticket (Box) in Windibank's Storeroom)
Susato:
Yes, this is where all the items that have been forfeited by their original owners are offered for sale.
Iris:
That's right. They've all got little price labels on them. But there are so many!
Ryunosuke:
I wonder if the small box this ticket was for is still on the shelves somewhere. (The box that McGilded deposited here just over two months ago...)
Susato:
Even if it were...finding it promises to be very troublesome indeed.
Iris:
There are so many boxes... It could be any one of them.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes said that a pawnbroker's was the safest place to store anything. More secure than a bank's vault. So perhaps this small box of Mr McGilded's contained something of very great value!
Iris:
Well if that's the case, he'd probably have kept it locked.
Ryunosuke:
So then we need to find every box with a lock and break them all open!
Susato:
Haiiiiii-YA!That sort of misconduct would get you arrested! I won't let that happen!
Ryunosuke:
(...Ah, this takes me back. it's been some time since Susato-san last threw me.)
Large stereoscope
Ryunosuke:
This is that strange contraption that lets you see pictures of things as if they're right in front of your eyes. It makes you think. When Mr Sholmes gleefully showed it to us yesterday... ...we were blissfully unaware that any of this was about to happen.
Machine in foreground
Ryunosuke:
I'm fairly sure this contraption was here yesterday as well. (Here we are, though I'm not confident I can get it closed again...)
Iris:
Oh yes! That's a folding stereoscope!
Ryunosuke:
Really? This is a stereoscope? Mr Sholmes showed us a picture yesterday that you were supposed to be able to see in three dimensions. But for that he used the great big contraption over there.
Iris:
Ah, well...that's for use in public houses and places like that. It contains a carousel with all sorts of pictures inside. But this little thing is a much simpler design for use at home. There are special shops selling prints you can use in them. I have a little collection myself!
Ryunosuke:
(...I wonder if I could make money out of these in Japan? It would beat keeping my toilet sparkling clean, anyway.)
Globes outside door
Ryunosuke:
Three golden balls...
Iris:
That's right. That sign shows the shop is a pawnbrokery. A bit like your armband shows you're a defense lawyer.
Ryunosuke:
And what's the significance of the three golden balls? Does it have some special meaning?
Iris:
......... I expect Hurley would like to answer that question when he's back from hospital.
Ryunosuke:
(...You mean you don't know.)
Calendar (before examining chalk outline in Windibank's Storeroom)
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Look here!
Susato:
Oh yes. A bullet hole. And I can see the bullet is still lodged in the wall.
Ryunosuke:
Presumably Mr Windibank wasn't practising with his revolver in his spare time.
Susato:
Ah, well... ...Mr Sholmes likes to practise in his drawing room whenever he can. He's very patriotic like that.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
It's all there in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', you know! Isn't that right, Iris?
Iris:
Ah...did I write something like that? Partly in jest, perhaps.
Susato:
In jest?!
Iris:
Well, he doesn't do it often. It is quite a dangerous pastime.
Ryunosuke:
He doesn't do it often? He shouldn't even do it once!
Iris:
Forget that for now, Runo. Let's examine this bullet!
Ryunosuke:
What's that around the bullet hole? Is it...blood? (Hm, a suspicious red stain on the calendar...)
Iris:
Aha! I may well be able to help with that!
Ryunosuke:
What?
Iris:
There's nothing like the sight of blood to get the blood pumping, is there, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... I have a feeling I'm not as bloody-minded as you, Iris.
Susato:
I'm afraid the sight of blood makes my blood run cold.
Iris:
There you have it, you see! When it comes to blood, we're all different types!
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, what a...scientific observation.
Iris:
So you need this!
Ryunosuke:
Oh no... What is that scary-looking thing?
Iris:
Hm...Hurley and I haven't actually come up with a name for it yet. But as soon as you see it in action, you'll understand what it does. ...Watch.
Ryunosuke:
...Oh! (The colour of the bloodstain has changed!)
Iris:
There! Does it make sense now?
Ryunosuke:
Yes...I think I'm starting to understand...
Iris:
Good! It works on the principle that different people have different types of blood, you see.
Susato:
Yes! How wonderful!
Iris:
The chemical it fires combines with the blood and makes it change colour. So you can identify whose blood it is that you're looking at in a flash!
Susato:
Oh, what a fabulous invention, Iris!
Iris:
Isn't it? Isn't it? I bet Ginny would say it's 'bleedin' great'!
Ryunosuke:
So...whose blood are we looking at then?
Iris:
......... Well, all the chemical does is turn the blood a different colour, so... ...just find someone whose blood turns the same colour and you'll know who it belongs to...in a flash!
Ryunosuke:
......... It's more like two flashes, really...isn't it?
Susato:
One flash or two, this could well turn out to be a very valuable clue. So we must make a note of it in the Court Record!
The blood sample has been entered into the Court Record.
Susato:
Let's keep testing and adding the results of any other blood analysis to the portfolio!
Iris:
As long as I have reagent left, sure.

Ryunosuke:

Iris:
Aha! This is where I come in!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Right... If the blood changes to be the same colour as the sample from the storeroom... ...we'll know that it's Mr Windibank's blood.
Iris:
Exactly! Here we go then!
Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Susato:
It's completely different to the colour that Mr Windibank's blood turned in the analysis.
Iris:
It just goes to show...things don't always go according to plan, do they?
Susato:
Nevertheless, we must add this sample to the results of the other blood analysis.
The blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record.
Calendar (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
Green blood... It just seems wrong somehow...
Iris:
Oh, there are all sorts of different colours. There are pretty pinks and purples, too, you know! Like I said...everyone's blood is different!
Ryunosuke:
(I wonder what colour my blood would turn out. ...Actually, I don't want to know?)
Converse (after examining counter)
Pair of photographs
Ryunosuke:
So Iris, about these two photographic prints... The one we found here on Mr Windibank's counter, and the one Gina gave us before... What is this amazing secret you mentioned that's hidden between these two identical prints?
Iris:
Actually, that's not quite right.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Iris:
If you look carefully...the two prints aren't the same. Not exactly.
Ryunosuke:
They're not?!
Iris:
Have another look at them now.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Iris:
Can you see that they're just slightly different from each other?
Ryunosuke:
I...I think so... (It's very subtle though...)
Susato:
But what's the reason for the subtle difference between the two prints?
Iris:
Ah, well! It's because they're a set, you see!
Ryunosuke:
No, I don't...
Iris:
This pair of photographs... ...is meant to be used in a stereoscope! Everyone in London is raving about them at the moment!
Ryunosuke:
(Ah, a stereoscope. Why do I feel as though I've heard that word before recently?)
Susato:
Oh! Yes! That's what Mr Sholmes showed us yesterday! You see? There it is, just over there!
Ryunosuke:
Ah, yes, of course. That magical machine that makes pictures look almost real enough to touch!
Iris:
Hehehe. Well actually... ...it's quite possible to see the same depth in pictures even without one of those contraptions.
Ryunosuke:
What? Really?
Iris:
Do you know how a pair of flat photographic prints can appear to have any depth in the first place?
Susato:
No, I have no idea.
Iris:
Oh, wonderful! Then I'll be able to tell you!
Ryunosuke:
(She's over the moon, bless her. Should we let her explain, though? We really need to carry on investigating the scene...)
Susato:
I for one...simply have to know!
How stereoscopic prints work (appears after "Pair of photographs")
Iris:
Have you ever considered, Runo... ...how our eyes see depth in the world around us?
Ryunosuke:
Well...I just open them...and it works.
Iris:
But the reason it works, is because we have two eyes.
Ryunosuke:
Two eyes... (Shocking...)
Iris:
If you try just closing one eye at a time, I think you'll see straight away. What you see with your left eye... ...and what you see with your right eye... ...are ever so slightly different. You get a different view with each eye.
Susato:
Yes, the position of objects seems to shift slightly.
Iris:
Exactly. And in your head, your brain uses that shift to estimate depth as it merges the two views into one. That's how we can sense depth in everything we see!
Ryunosuke:
Haah...my brain really is amazing, isn't it? It does so much without telling me.
Susato:
Ah, I think I see! So the pair of photographs... ...consist of a left eye view... ...and a right eye view! Is that right?
Iris:
Oh, well done, Susie! You're so quick!
Ryunosuke:
So, if you can persuade your brain to merge the two pictures together in your head... ...you'd be able to see depth in these prints?
Iris:
Yes, Runo! You're beginning to understand!
Ryunosuke:
And a stereoscope's function is to act as your brain and allow you to do just that?
Iris:
Yes, but... ...as long as you have two images, two eyes and one brain... ...you can actually do it yourself, without needing a stereoscope at all!
Ryunosuke:
You can? Really?!
How to view stereoscopic prints (appears after "Pair of photographs")
Iris:
Let's try it. Let's see if you can view this pair of prints without the help of a stereoscope!
Susato:
Oh yes! I'm dying to have a go!
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san really loves this kind of thing...)
Iris:
You need to be able to cross your eyes, that's the main thing. Can you both do that?
Ryunosuke:
Cross my eyes? (I, I think I can...)
Iris:
Watch me and see if you can copy! Make your eyes...do this.
Susato:
Alright! Let me try! Are you ready, Mr Naruhodo? There! How's that?
Iris:
Wonderful! Now it's your turn, Runo.
Susato:
The trick is to concentrate on looking at the bridge of your nose with both eyes at the same time.
Ryunosuke:
(...Not exactly an easy task when two people are staring at you cross-eyed.)
Iris:
Alright, that's enough practice. Now let's try it looking at the prints. Start by looking at one print and slowly crossing your eyes... You should see two overlapping images, like this. You try it now, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
(I'm just going to have to give it a try, I suppose. .........)
Iris:
Did the print split into two images for you? Now, the next step... ...is to put the pair of prints side by side like this, and then to try crossing your eyes again. The prints should slowly merge together... ...until... ...they form a new, single image in the centre.
Susato:
Oh, yeeeeeeeeesss!!! Mr Naruhodo! It works! I can see it in the middle now! It looks so real! Oh, I could look at it all day!
Ryunosuke:
I...wouldn't advise that. Your eyes might start to hurt.
Iris:
Your turn, Runo! Pretend you're looking through the two pictures and slowly cross your eyes... Keep adjusting the position of your eyes until the two images overlap exactly in the middle.
Ryunosuke:
(Like...this, is it? .........)
Iris:
There! You managed it! So now you know how stereoscopic images work.
Susato:
Well...I don't know who discovered it, but it really is quite extraordinary.
Present
Gina's Representation Papers
Iris:
Poor Ginny... This is all my fault, really... But she'll be alright, won't she? In court tomorrow, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
I'll defend her with everything I've got.
Iris:
......... So...she'll be alright? Won't she?
Ryunosuke:
(...Am I that bad at instilling confidence?)
Blood Samples Portfolio
Ryunosuke:
The way you can identify differences in people's blood like this is amazing. You really are a genius, Iris!
Iris:
I know! I am! If Hurley and I put our minds to it, we could really shake up Britain's chemists and alchemists.
Susato:
And you could shake up Japan's lawyers and judges, couldn't you, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, for sure...even if I didn't intend to.
Iris's Story Manuscript
Iris:
Oh, my manuscript...
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes said he'd deposited it at Windibank's and he had.
Iris:
But it's so strange... What is it about this particular story? I worked so hard on it. Why would Hurley say I can't publish it?
Ryunosuke:
I'm afraid I have no idea. All you can do is wait until he's ready to tell you, I suppose.
Iris:
Oh! Maaaybe... ...it's because Hurley isn't in it enough! Maybe I didn't give him enough good lines!
Ryunosuke:
Yeees...maaaybe... (I wish I could say that definitely isn't the reason, but...I can't.)
After clearing all Converse options:
Iris:
So what do you think of these stereoscopic prints then, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
They're certainly amazing, but it isn't easy to get the knack of viewing them properly.
Iris:
No, some people find it easier than others. But that's why contraptions like this exist. For people who find it tricky.
Susato:
Oh! I recognise that. We saw one over there yesterday, didn't we? If I remember correctly, you press this little knob here... ...then set the pair of photographs in this stand at the back and...
Ryunosuke:
It's still amazing, even though I know roughly how it works now.
Iris:
Well, London seems to agree with you. Stereoscopes are very popular at the moment. You can find one of these folding contraptions in lots of households in the capital currently.
Ryunosuke:
But if these little machines are so affordable... ...surely there's no need to go around staring cross-eyed at pictures like you hate them.
Iris:
......... But it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Well, I think so, in any case.
Ryunosuke:
(Stereoscopic pictures... I'd never even heard of them until yesterday. We've certainly learnt a lot about them. But I wonder if it's knowledge that I'll ever actually need...)
The second white cat photograph has been entered into the Court Record.
If side with writing on White Cat Photograph has not been examined yet
Ryunosuke:
(Which reminds me... ...the back of this photograph was used to write out the pawnbroker's ticket that Gina brought in here yesterday. And the other photograph came from the pocket of McGilded's overcoat.)
Iris:
We need to examine everything thoroughly, don't forget!
Examine evidence
Pawnbroker's Ticket (Box)
Side with photo of cat
Ryunosuke:
This is an adorable little cat. I think it looks a little like Wagahai. I always thought that cats liked to curl up inside under the heated kotatsu blanket when it snowed. ...Maybe British cats are different. Actually, now we have both pictures... ...I could have another go at viewing them as a stereoscopic image. (So, I need to cross my eyes and try to get the two cats to merge in the middle as one... It's such a hard thing to do. Whoever thought of this in the first place must have spent a long time staring!)
White Cat Photograph #2
Side with photo of cat
Ryunosuke:
So this is the second of the two photographic prints of the cat. And it really does look like Wagahai. It looks exactly the same as the first photograph at first glance. I suppose that's what's so compelling. Actually, now we have both pictures... ...I could have another go at viewing them as a stereoscopic image. (So, I need to cross my eyes and try to get the two cats to merge in the middle as one... It's such a hard thing to do. Whoever thought of this in the first place must have spent a long time staring!)
Side with writing
Ryunosuke:
This is the ticket that Gina brought in here yesterday.
Susato:
Yes. Having been entrusted to her by Mr McGilded two months earlier. 'Article deposited: One gentleman's overcoat'
Ryunosuke:
And the other redemption ticket was in the pocket of that coat.
Susato:
Yes, for a 'small box', deposited two days before the omnibus incident.
Ryunosuke:
(Could that have anything to do with all this...?)
Bloody fingermark (before examining calendar in Windibank's Main Shop or chalk outline in Windibank's Storeroom)
Ryunosuke:
Look, this dark red smear appears to have been made by somebody's finger.
Iris:
Do you think...it could be blood?
Ryunosuke:
......... Do you see any red mark as blood, Iris? That's a bit morbid, I think.
Iris:
...But it's almost certainly blood, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
(Tsk, ten-year-olds today...)
Bloody fingermark (after examining calendar in Windibank's Main Shop or chalk outline in Windibank's Storeroom)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo... ...I don't know if you've noticed, but there's something rather troubling here.
Ryunosuke:
I have noticed.
Susato:
The red smear, you mean?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It looks like blood, doesn't it? (I wondered if Susato-san had picked up on that.) Well in that case...
Susato:
Yes, we need Iris!
Ryunosuke:
We should show this to her before we forget.

Calendar (first time, after examining bloody fingermark on White Cat Photograph #2)
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Look here!
Susato:
Oh yes. A bullet hole. And I can see the bullet is still lodged in the wall.
Ryunosuke:
Presumably Mr Windibank wasn't practising with his revolver in his spare time.
Susato:
Ah, well... ...Mr Sholmes likes to practise in his drawing room whenever he can. He's very patriotic like that.

Present
Pawnbroker's Ticket (Coat)
Leads to:
"Oh! That looks like blood!"
Iris:
Oh! That looks like blood!
Ryunosuke:
I would say it's from a gloved finger. Almost certainly a glove made of leather.
iris:
Well don't worry, Runo! You can leave the rest to me!
Ryunosuke:
Look at that...
Iris:
Yes, that's a colour we haven't seen before, isn't it?
Susato:
We simply must add it to the portfolio of blood samples! It could be an important clue. Although...it would be nice to find out whose blood these different colours correspond to at some point.
Ryunosuke:
......... (Well, this particular stain of blood...)
Iris:
Oh! You've had an idea, haven't you? Do you know whose blood this is?
No idea!
Ryunosuke:
How could I? We don't have a known sample of the same colour. Without that, it's impossible to know.
Susato:
Oh, how very vexing...
Iris:
......... I wonder.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Iris:
Well, it's true that the colour doesn't help us. But what about considering how the mark came to be there in the first place? You might have an idea about that...mightn't you, Runo? .........
Ryunosuke:
(Not if you keep staring at me like that, no.)
Iris:
Let's try that again, shall we?
Leads back to:
"Well, this particular stain of blood..."
I think I do!
Leads to:
"Yes, I have an idea whose blood it is."
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I have an idea whose blood it is. Not from the colour it turned, but with a little deduction.
Iris:
That's right! I think it's clear.
Susato:
Iris, you know as well?
Iris:
You first, Runo. Who do you think it belongs to?
Ryunosuke:
Alright, I believe that this is the blood of...
Magnus McGilded
Susato:
...Mr McGilded?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. After all, this redemption ticket belonged to him.
Susato:
Oh, you don't think...?! You mean that during the incident on the omnibus...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I expect so. It's a very clear print and no small amount of blood. So it must have resulted from a fairly serious accident... such as he might have sustained on the omnibus.
Susato:
Wait, but...if I remember rightly... ...no sign of injury was found on Mr McGilded at all.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Iris:
We're trying to work out who the blood came from. So we can rule out anyone who hadn't been bleeding straight away.
Ryunosuke:
......... Yes, I suppose we can. (I'll have to think this through some more. Who do we know was bleeding at the time?)
Leads back to:
"Alright, I believe that this is the blood of..."
Gina Lestrade
Susato:
Oh my! You think this is Gina's blood?!
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It was Gina who brought the ticket here to Windibank's, after all. Sometimes the simplest answer is the right one.
Susato:
Hm...but Gina doesn't own any gloves...at all.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Iris:
And Ginny wasn't injured either, was she?
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Iris:
We're trying to work out who the blood came from. So we can rule out anyone who hadn't been bleeding straight away.
Ryunosuke:
......... Perhaps my answer was a little too simple. (I'll have to think this through some more. Who do we know was bleeding at the time?)
Leads back to:
"Alright, I believe that this is the blood of..."
'Thrice-Fired' Mason
Leads to:
"...'Thrice-Fired' Mason...?"
Pop Windibank
Susato:
You, you think somehow it could be Mr Windibank's blood?
Ryunosuke:
Well, he would have been the last person to have handled the ticket. Sometimes the simplest answer is the right one.
Susato:
But...Mr Windibank had no injuries. Before he was shot, that is.
Iris:
We're trying to work out who the blood came from. So we can rule out anyone who hadn't been bleeding straight away.
Ryunosuke:
......... Yes, of course.
Iris:
Perhaps it's not a concept you can really grasp unless you've bled before yourself.
Ryunosuke:
...Funnily enough, I have accidentally cut myself before. But thanks for the mildly threatening advice, Iris. (I'll have to think this through some more. Who do we know was bleeding at the time?)
Leads back to:
"Alright, I believe that this is the blood of..."
Ryunosuke:
...'Thrice-Fired' Mason...?
Iris:
You don't sound very sure of yourself, the way you trailed off there.
Ryunosuke:
Well it was two months ago now, that case. And of course I'd never met the victim. So I'm struggling to remember his name. He was definitely 'Thrice-Fired', though.
Susato:
The victim...of the omnibus case? Yes, his name was indeed Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason. But that would mean that this bloodstain... ...was left on the ticket two months ago!
Ryunosuke:
Yes. I think it was. Gina brought this ticket here to Windibank's yesterday. I'm suggesting that the bloodstain was already on it at that time.
Iris:
So it's a smear of blood from the time that Mr Mason was killed two months ago!
Susato:
Something else is coming back to me now... Mr McGilded was also wearing leather gloves that night.
McGilded:
Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand.
Ryunosuke:
It certainly does look like a leather-gloved thumbprint, this mark. But we know that Mr McGilded had no injuries at the time, anywhere on his body. From which we can conclude... ...that any blood on the glove...belonged to the victim, Mr Mason!
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! You sound just like Mr Sholmes!
Ryunosuke:
(...Minus the quirky slip-ups, I hope.)
Iris:
Yes, I think you're right, Runo!
Susato:
Very well. Let's make a note of this.
The details of the pawnbroker's ticket for the coat have been updated in the Court Record.
The blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record.
Examine evidence
Pawnbroker's Ticket (Coat)
Side with writing
Ryunosuke:
Mr Windibank appears to have used the back of this photograph to write out a redemption ticket. He's written it very neatly, but still. Perhaps he ran out of paper, so had to use anything he had to hand. It's hard to know what's the front and what's the reverse side now...
Bloody fingermark
Ryunosuke:
So this smear is blood.
Susato:
Yes. It reacted to the chemicals fired out of Iris's strange gun, so it must be. And it does look as though it's a thumbprint from a hand in a leather glove.
Ryunosuke:
Ah... ...Mr Sholmes wears leather gloves, doesn't he?
Susato:
......... He wears fingerless leather gloves, though. Fingerless.
Ryunosuke:
(Oh dear, is someone a little upset?)
16th April
Local Prison, Cell 13
Ryunosuke:
Gina doesn't appear to be here.
Susato:
I believe she must be in questioning at the moment.
Iris:
Oh, but...wait a minute...
Ryunosuke:
What is it, Iris?
Iris:
Well if you examine the scene here carefully, there's another possibility, isn't there? Ginny could have slipped the key from the jailer when he wasn't looking and escaped!
Susato:
Oh my!
Ryunosuke:
Why, why would she do something like that? It would only make her situation worse!
Iris:
......... Calm down, Runo! I was only joking of course!
Ryunosuke:
......... Oh. Ugh...you had me worried there. I thought it was a 'great deduction'.
Susato:
Yes, it must be your way with words, Iris. You're so wonderfully persuasive. Perhaps you don't fully understand the weight your words carry.
Iris:
Oh dear... I'm sorry. I suppose a light-hearted great detective is a contradiction in terms.
Ryunosuke:
Well, in the same situation, I'm sure Mr Sholmes would just have thrown his head back and guffawed.
Susato:
I'm not entirely sure that's helpful, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Well anyway, it looks like we won't be able to talk to Gina for a while. We should try to make progress with our investigation in the meantime.
Iris:
Yes. Come along then, Runo! Come along, Susie!
16th April
Windibank's Storeroom
Iris:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Poor Iris... She's clammed up completely.)
Susato:
Iris is bound to find this difficult. After all, Mr Windibank's life was taken in this very room only last night.
Iris:
.........
Gregson:
.........Ah!
Ryunosuke:
Wait! Inspector!
Gregson:
What is it now, sunshine?
Ryunosuke:
You took one look at me and tried to run away!
Gregson:
You think a Scotland Yard inspector would run away from some jumped-up little defence lawyer, do ya?
Iris:
.........
Gregson:
I just! Well... ...I've never seen Her Ladyship lookin' like that before, is the thing. I didn't know what to say to her.
Ryunosuke:
(So you weren't running away from me...you were running away from a ten-year-old.)
Susato:
I'm afraid this is all a little much for young Iris. Some gentle reassurance might go a long way perhaps, Inspector.
Gregson:
Eh?!
Iris:
.........
Gregson:
Erm... Ahem! Don't, um... Don't trouble yourself unduly, Your Ladyship. I mean...at least you're not dead, are you?
Ryunosuke:
...I don't think that went very well.
Gregson:
......... WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! Look! I'm in the middle of an investigation here, sunshine! And I told you not to get under my feet!
Susato:
And we have investigating to do ourselves.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. I'd like to hear more of what the socially inept inspector has to say.
Iris:
Oh Hurley...
Ryunosuke:
(And enquire into how Mr Sholmes's operation is going...)
Examine
Shelves on sides, gramophone, or bicycle
Ryunosuke:
Look at all these articles that have been deposited. The room is stuffed full of them.
Iris:
I can't believe how many there are.
Susato:
A bicycle, a gramophone, musical instruments... Even some enormous paintings, look.
Ryunosuke:
Pieces of different people's lives, quietly gathering dust in here together. (There's something very peaceful about the atmosphere in here. ...Or at least there would be, if not for the chalk outline on the floor and the policemen shuffling around.)
Gregson:
...Not much I can do about that, sunshine.
Chalk outline (before examining calendar in Windibank's Main Shop)
Ryunosuke:
(The police have marked the position of the body with a chalk line.)
Iris:
Poor Mr Windibank... He was a nice old man.
Gregson:
Well, he was shot just once, through the heart. Most likely, the fellow died instantly. He wouldn't have felt a thing.
Iris:
......... Aha! I may well be able to help with that!
Ryunosuke:
What?
Iris:
There's nothing like the sight of blood to get the blood pumping, is there, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... I have a feeling I'm not as bloody-minded as you, Iris.
Susato:
I'm afraid the sight of blood makes my blood run cold.
Iris:
There you have it, you see! When it comes to blood, we're all different types!
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, what a...scientific observation.
Iris:
So you need this!
Ryunosuke:
Oh no... What is that scary-looking thing?
Iris:
Hm...Hurley and I haven't actually come up with a name for it yet. But as soon as you see it in action, you'll understand what it does. ...Watch.
Ryunosuke:
...Oh! (The colour of the bloodstain has changed!)
Iris:
There! Does it make sense now?
Ryunosuke:
Yes...I think I'm starting to understand...
Iris:
Good! It works on the principle that different people have different types of blood, you see.
Susato:
Yes! How wonderful!
Iris:
The chemical it fires combines with the blood and makes it change colour. So you can identify whose blood it is that you're looking at in a flash!
Susato:
Oh, what a fabulous invention, Iris!
Iris:
Isn't it? Isn't it? I bet Ginny would say it's 'bleedin' great'!
Ryunosuke:
So...whose blood are we looking at then?
Iris:
This must be Mr Windibank's blood.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. This is where he was shot, so... (...there can't be any question of that.)
Susato:
This could turn out to be a very valuable clue. So we simply must make a note of it!
The blood analysis has been entered into the Court Record.
Susato:
Let's keep testing and adding the results of any other blood analysis to the portfolio!
Iris:
As long as I have reagent left, sure.

Iris:

Ryunosuke:
This must be his blood, then.
Iris:
Ah!
Susato:
I don't like to ask at such a wretched time, Iris, but I wonder if perhaps-
Iris:
Don't worry, Susie! I'm ready for action!
Susato:
So...now we know the colour the chemical turns when it reacts with Mr Windibank's blood.
Iris:
Hm...and it doesn't match our analysis of the bloodstain we found in the main shop.
Susato:
No. But let's add this sample to the others we've already collected, anyway.
The blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record.
Chalk outline (subsequent times)
Iris:

Ryunosuke:
Iris...?
Iris:
......... Don't worry, I'm alright. But we MUST find the true culprit!
Susato:
Yes! Absolutely!
Red chest
Ryunosuke:
Out of all the articles in the storeroom... ...this is the only thing that shows any sign of being ransacked.
Iris:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
What is it, Iris?
Iris:
That's... That's the box file that my manuscript was being kept in.
Susato:
Oh!
Ryunosuke:
(Iris's unpublished story. 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... Surely that's not what all this...)
Gina:
Sorry, Iris, but if you ask me, 'e's sold it. Wivout tellin' you.
Susato:
We must check inside the box at once!
Iris:
Yes...
.........Ah!
Susato:
It was there! Iris's story was there!
Ryunosuke:
Really? It was? Well, that's good news, isn't it, Iris?
Iris:
Um...yes... I mean, of course I believed Hurley when he said he'd deposited it here, but still... ...it's a relief to actually see it.
Ryunosuke:
(...Really? Because that's not a very well hidden frown...)
Iris:

Revolver
Ryunosuke:
This, this is a revolver. A real one!
Susato:
And quite...quite possibly the murder weapon! Used to take Mr Windibank's life!
Iris:
What's the matter, Susie? You and Runo look like you're about to faint.
Susato:
Well, it's just that...I've rarely seen a gun in the flesh!
Ryunosuke:
And I've...had issues with guns in the past. But anyway, we saw Mr Windibank with this yesterday, didn't we?
Windibank:
I shall have to take my own life!
Ryunosuke:
(It must be the same gun.)
(And last night... ...when I looked through the spy hole in the door to the storeroom here... ...that was the same gun I saw...in Gina's hand.)
Susato:
Mr Windibank told us that he only ever had a single bullet loaded in his revolver, didn't he?
Iris:
Well, it's empty now. The one and only bullet he had in his gun has been fired.
Ryunosuke:
(So we can be fairly certain...that only a single shot was fired from this revolver...)
Converse
The scene of the crime
Ryunosuke:
So, Inspector, what do you make of the crime scene here?
Gregson:
Pshaw! You've got eyes, haven't you? Use 'em! It is what it looks like. Nothin' more, nothin' less!
Ryunosuke:
......... Iris, could you lend me a hand?
Iris:
So, Gregsy, what do you make of the crime scene here?
Gregson:
Oh yes, Your Ladyship, do allow me to humbly explain! Last night at shortly after the hour of one o'clock in the mornin', Scotland Yard police attended the scene. The one and only door to this storeroom was found locked from the inside.
Ryunosuke:
(So it was locked from the inside...)
Susato:
The lock appears to be broken now, though. Was that the police officers' doing?
Gregson:
Quite right, ma'am, quite right. We took the liberty of smashin' the door in...as humbly as possible.
Susato:
Oh...
Gregson:
As you can see, the victim was discovered prostrate on the floor, um...thuswise. And next to the aforementioned body, we discovered the vile gutter-child.
Iris:
Are you talking about Ginny? She's my friend, you know, Inspector!
Gregson:
......... Miss Lestrade - the hapless girl - was curled up on the floor, dead to the world.
Ryunosuke:
(...She's still alive, you know.) Yes, when I saw her, she appeared to be unconscious.
Gregson:
And I'm afraid to say...she had the gun that was used in her hand.
Iris:
No!
Ryunosuke:
(Presumably it's the gun that's still down there on the floor now.)
Gregson:
In her pocket, we found the key to the door as well.
Ryunosuke:
What?! The key to this storeroom?
Susato:
And you say...the storeroom had been locked from the inside, Inspector?
Gregson:
Correct. All of which leaves Her Ladyship's friend... ...in somethin' of a sticky situation, I'm afraid.
Iris:
.........
Gregson:
Obviously! ...My personal opinion is that it's all some sort of misunderstandin'!
Ryunosuke:
(Of course it is, Inspector. Of course it is.)
Sholmes's operation
Iris:
Gregsy, do you know anything about Hurley? Is the operation finished? Is Hurley alright? Is he?
Gregson:
Um! Well, erm...the thing is, um...
Susato:
Don't mince your words, Inspector! ...Please! Y-You don't mean to say that Mr Sholmes is...is...
Gregson:
No no no! The operation's done and dusted! It's just that...well...
Susato:
Out with it!
Gregson:
Yes, ma'am! They used somethin' called a general anaesthetic. It's the latest thing. Renders the whole body insensitive.
Ryunosuke:
The whole body...anaesthetised? Is that even possible?
Gregson:
It means the operation can be completed while the patient is fast asleep.
Susato:
Goodness, in the Empire of Japan, we can just manage to provide laughing gas for a tooth extraction...
Gregson:
The trouble is, the latest thing isn't always the greatest thing, if you follow my meanin'. They couldn't get the medication to work at first, so it took hours for him to nod off, or so I hear. And now that the op's finished , they...they can't get him to wake up, apparently.
Susato:
Oh my!
Gregson:
No one knows if it's the anaesthetic still in his system, or if the bloke's just plain exhausted. But anyway, all they can do is stand back and watch until he comes round again.
Iris:
Hurley...
Gregson:
The moment he opens his eyes, Your Ladyship, I swear I shall get word to you!
Ryunosuke:
(What a surprise. Even in matters of life and death, Mr Sholmes has to do things 'his way'.)
The second redemption ticket (appears after presenting Pawnbroker's Ticket (Box))
Ryunosuke:
This ticket was in one of the pockets of Mr McGilded's overcoat.
Gregson:
Eh?! You, you mean to tell me...?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, there was more than just the music box disk, it seems.
Gregson:
Hmph. I should've insisted on the lads takin' it back to the Yard and examinin' it properly.
Susato:
Well, according to the details on this ticket... ...Mr McGilded deposited another article here with Mr Windibank.
Gregson:
Yes, I can see it written here. A small box, was it?
Iris:
Do you have any idea where it is, Gregsy? Any idea at all? It's another article belonging to Mr McGilded. It could be an important clue!
Gregson:
Well, um, yes, erm... I, I suppose it could be...
Iris:
.........
Gregson:
Please! Stop lookin' at me with those big, turquoise eyes, all full of hope and expectation! It's too much pressure! I'll lose me marbles, I will! I'll go barkin'!
Ryunosuke:
...This is no time for dog impressions, Inspector.
Gregson:
That's enough sauce from you, sunshine! ......... There is one thing that springs to mind. Accordin' to this ticket, the redemption deadline's already passed, hasn't it?
Iris:
Oh yes, of course. Articles are only held for two months.
Susato:
So the small box will no longer be in here, then.
Gregson:
That's right. It's been forfeited.
Susato:
Which means, it could be on the shelves in the front of the shop, where the forfeited items are offered for sale!
Ryunosuke:
Yes! The shelves in the front! We must search them at once!
Gregson:
You're wastin' your time.
Susato:
Oh!
Gregson:
There are dozens of little boxes out there. Hundreds, even. We can't possibly know which one might've been McGilded's. That information's not written in the ledger.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Iris:
Well, I think we should at least have a look, just in case.
Gregson:
Of course, Your Ladyship, of course! Very sensible of you, I'm sure!
Ryunosuke:
(This is getting old...)
Present
Pawnbroker's Ticket (Box)
Ryunosuke:
Um, Inspector...what do you make of this?
Gregson:
Ah, what have we here, then? A redemption ticket for an article deposited here, is it? Looks like someone ran out of office stationery and wrote the ticket on whatever paper was to hand. Yes, this is the ticket for McGilded's overcoat. The one that little diver turned up with yesterday.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, actually no, it's not.
Gregson:
...Really? Think you know better than me, do ya?
Ryunosuke:
No, I, I didn't mean to, um...
Iris:
Runo's right, Gregsy. It isn't the same ticket.
Gregson:
Of course it isn't! Of course it isn't! I never doubted you, Your Ladyship! So, what's all this about then, if I might be so bold as to ask?
Iris:
This is a second ticket.
Gregson:
A second one?
Ryunosuke:
It seems that Mr McGilded in fact had another article in storage here at Windibank's.
Gregson:
......... Is that right?
Susato:
...I think we need to discuss this further with the inspector, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
(Oh good. Because he's ever so easy to talk to...)
Iris's Story Manuscript
Gregson:
Is, is that what I think it is?! Y-Y-Your Ladyship's latest?!
Iris:
Yes, my latest story. It's called, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.
Gregson:
A, a most fascinatin' title, Your Ladyship! Faaascinatin'! ...And, um... I don't suppose... Would there be any mention of my humble self in the tale this time?
Iris:
Hm...good question. I can't really remember.
Gregson:
I see, I see. Well, why would you, Your Ladyship? I'll just await its publication with eager anticipation!
Ryunosuke:
You needn't worry, Inspector. I'm sure if you do appear, you won't be doing anything particularly remarkable.
Gregson:
...You lookin' to be arrested, sunshine?
Ryunosuke:
(I didn't mean it like that! ...And even if I did, you wouldn't have bitten Her Ladyship's head off, would you?)

After clearing all Converse options, examining calendar, and presenting Pawnbroker's Ticket (Coat) in Windibank's Main Shop, and clearing all Converse options, examining chalk outline, red chest, and revolver in Windibank's Storeroom:
*Dong* *Dong* *Dong*
Iris:
AAAAAAGH!!! I nearly jumped out of my skin there! How could Mr Windibank set such a wicked trap?!
Ryunosuke:
I...I doubt he set out to scare anyone.
Susato:
Is that really the time? I think perhaps we should pay Gina another visit soon.
Ryunosuke:
Oh?
Susato:
Her trial is tomorrow. We must establish whether or not you will be defending her. I think we should ask her one more time. ...She may have changed her mind.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Iris:
Don't you remember, Runo? You told her she could rip up the representation papers if she didn't want you to be her lawyer.
Ryunosuke:
...Really? Did I say that?
Yes.
You did.
Susato:
The deadline for submitting the paperwork is fast approaching.
Ryunosuke:
(In that case, we had better hurry back to the prison and talk to Gina again.)
16th April, 5:41 p.m.
Local Prison, Cell 13
Ryunosuke:
Ah, Gina, good... You're back.
Gina:
Ah! .........
Susato:
The police must have finished questioning her, then.
Iris:
Oh, how was it, Ginny? Was it awful?
Gina:
Eh? Oh... Didn't bother me.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you for the papers you signed before. It meant we were able to investigate at Windibank's.
Gina:
Oh...right... .........
Iris:
Don't you want to know how we got on? We've been ever so busy.
Gina:
......... Wot's the point in askin'? Won't change wot everyone's sayin'. That I did it.
Iris:
That's not...
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Gina, we came to ask for your final decision.
Gina:
Eh? Wot decision?
Ryunosuke:
About tomorrow's trial. Will you let me defend you or not?
Gina:
...!
Susato:
I must submit the paperwork now if you'd like Mr Naruhodo to represent you.
Gina:
Right...I see...
Ryunosuke:
(She's really lost her fight all of a sudden. But I know what that feels like. The worry is just so hard to bear...)

What we've uncovered
Iris:
.........
Gina:
......... Oh, alright then! Blimey, give it a rest wiv them eyes, Iris! So come on then, fill us in. Who done it?
Ryunosuke:
Unfortunately we don't know that yet.
Gina:
...You don't say.
Susato:
We don't know 'yet', Gina. But Mr Naruhodo - and all of us - know that you are innocent of this crime.
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
And while we haven't yet managed to work out who the real culprit is... ...there are a number of interesting facts that we have managed to establish.
Gina:
Oh yeah? Like wot?
Ryunosuke:
Well, for example... ...the reason for you being there in the first place. I think I know now why you broke into Windibank's that night.
Gina:
.........
If Iris's Story Manuscript hasn't been presented yet
Ryunosuke:
(It looks like I'm going to have to take some evidence that clearly reveals the reason... ...and thrust it in Gina's face! ...Or I could present it to her calmly, I suppose.)
Representation in court
Susato:
We already have the representation papers and other documents we need.
Ryunosuke:
All we have to do is hand them to the court clerk. That is...if you'll allow me to represent you in court tomorrow?
Gina:
......... Nah. Don't bother.
Iris:
Ginny...
Gina:
Rip 'em up and chuck 'em, would ya? Them 'respresentation papers' or wotever they're called. This cell ain't fancy enough to 'ave a bin.
Ryunosuke:
So...what will you do in court tomorrow?
Gina:
I'll be fine on me own.
Iris:
...I don't think you will be.
Gina:
Look, it don't matter. Wot's gonna 'appen is gonna 'appen.
Ryunosuke:
(This is one stubborn pickpocket.)
Iris's manuscript (appears after presenting Iris's Story Manuscript)
Gina:
......... Alright, yeah... This 'Baskervilles' story - it's the latest Sholmes adventure, right? But it ain't been printed yet. So I figured...it's gotta be worth a fair few pieces o' silver, right?
Susato:
Oh yes. At least five thousand pounds.
Iris:
What?!
Ryunosuke:
So...you intended to sell Iris's manuscript, did you?
Iris:
No... Ginny, how could you?
Gina:
Wot? Wait! No, 'ang on! 'Course I weren't gonna sell it! All I wanted to do was find out if the 'mantelscript', or wotever ya call it, really was there or not. That's the only reason I was in the place!
Susato:
For Iris's sake...isn't that right?
Gina:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
We knew why you'd done it from the start, Gina. Of course we did.
Gina:
But...
Iris:
I knew you wouldn't do anything mean like that, Ginny! I just knew it!
Gina:
Well, um...erm...
Ryunosuke:
When I saw the manuscript in the storeroom, it reminded me of what you'd said the night before.
Gina:
Grown-ups do a lot worse than that, believe me. Barefaced liars, the lot of 'em! You just ain't realised it yet.
Iris:
.........
Gina:
I'm tellin' ya, that 'mantelscript' ain't at Windibank's. You'd soon see if you 'ad a look!
Iris:
......... If I'm honest... ...I have wondered if Hurley's telling me the truth sometimes. I mean that I sometimes wonder if he might have hidden my manuscript somewhere. Somewhere I don't know. Even though it's wrong of me to doubt him...
Gina:
.........
Iris:
Oh, Ginny, that was so sweet of you!
Gina:
......... Alright, alright... I'll tell ya why I did it. Just stop lookin' at me like that, Iris.
Reason for breaking in (appears after "Iris's manuscript")
Gina:
It weren't because of Iris. That's not why I did it. I just...wanted to know the truth, that's all.
Susato:
You wanted to know if Mr Sholmes was being honest? If he'd really deposited the manuscript at Windibank's?
Gina:
...It's like I told ya the night before... ...I never 'ad a father. But Iris's lot ain't like mine. She's got 'er dad, only she can't see 'im. And I reckon that's gotta be 'arder.
Iris:
...!
Gina:
That's why she writes 'er stories. They're about 'er dad really. That's wot it sounded like to me, anyway. Last night, when I was listenin' to wot you were sayin'.
Iris:
Stories...about Daddy...? .........
Ryunosuke:
You mean they're not the adventures of a great detective... ...so much as the adventures of a great detective and his trusty partner?
Gina:
Well, that's 'ow I see it, yeah.
Iris:
......... You're so thoughtful and so kind, Ginny.
Susato:
Yes. And we never thought any differently, did we?
Gina:
Look! Give it a rest, will ya? I 'ate all this chummy nonsense! D'you 'ear? I 'ate it! I don't trust no one, right? That's 'ow I work. Cos if you don't trust no one, no one can let ya down! So leave me alone! Go on! Scarper!
Ryunosuke:
......... .................. (I hadn't noticed until now, but it's unmistakable. Right there on both sleeves of that overcoat... ...are some very suspicious red stains!)
Gina:
...Wot? Why are you lookin' at me like that?
Ryunosuke:

Alright then. ......... Wait, what? (Shouldn't she be thanking ME then?)
Gina:
You know wot, Mr Narrow-'Oddo...? It ain't good manners to expect thanks if you do someone a favour.
Ryunosuke:
......... I KNOW THAT! (She's as tricky with words as she is with her fingers.)
Pawnbroker's Ticket (Coat)
Ryunosuke:
Do you see this pawnbroker's ticket, Gina? It's the one you took to Windibank's, isn't it? The one for that black overcoat that you're wearing now.
Gina:
Eh? Wot, that? I dunno. They all look the same to me, those tickets.
Ryunosuke:
(Surely not...) Well this one has a very obvious mark on it...that would appear to be blood.
Gina:
Eh?!
Ryunosuke:
Does that ring any bells?
Gina:
...I dunno. It all looks the same to me, blood.
Ryunosuke:
(And they all sound the same to me, these answers. Suspicious.)
Iris's Story Manuscript
Ryunosuke:
We found this in Mr Windibank's storeroom: The manuscript of Iris's latest story.
Gina:
Ah! Oh...right. Well that's good then.
Ryunosuke:
Curiously, the storeroom at Windibank's showed no sign of being ransacked for items of value or the like. With one exception: The box file that housed this manuscript.
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
It was you, wasn't it, Gina? Who broke open the box containing this manuscript last night.
Gina:
Eh?!
Ryunosuke:
You were determined to find out whether or not 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' was really there. That's the real reason you broke into the storeroom last night, isn't it?
Gina:
AAAAAAGH!
Ryunosuke:
Why don't you tell us what happened? Please.
Blood Samples Portfolio (after clearing "Reason for breaking in" Converse option)
Leads to:
"Those stains on the sleeves of your new coat, Gina..."
Ryunosuke:
Those stains on the sleeves of your new coat, Gina... They're blood, aren't they? Not that I know whose blood yet.
Gina:
WOT?!
Susato:
B-Blood, Mr Naruhodo?!
Ryunosuke:
You don't appear to have any obvious wounds yourself, though. So could it be blood that spattered from Mr Windibank when he was shot last night?
Iris:
Let's not beat around the bush here. This trusty friend of mine will get results much faster than anything else!
Gina:
Eh?! T-Take it easy, Iris!
Iris:
Don't move, Ginny! I'm going to shoot!
Oh...
Susato:
Oh my!
Ryunosuke:
What the...? Forget the sleeves...
Iris:
...The whole coat is covered in blood!
Ryunosuke:
(Of course! The black colour of the fabric was masking the stains. That's why we haven't seen them until now!)
Susato:
And the blood has reacted with the chemical to turn a purple colour... ...which matches one of the samples we've already collected perfectly!
Iris:
Yes, now let's see...who had the purple blood? Aha! Yes, it was the brickmaker, Mr Mason. The victim of the murder case two months ago.
Ryunosuke:
......... (I knew it...)
Gina:
Wot, wot are you all on about? The victim? Wot d'you mean?
Susato:
......... It's a rather uncomfortable situation, Mr Naruhodo, but I think this makes things quite clear. It means the omnibus case is finally solved. The truth about who really murdered the brickmaker, Mr Mason...is revealed.
Gina:
Oi! Would someone explain wot's goin' on?! Stop tellin' 'alf a story!
Susato:

The truth of the omnibus case
Ryunosuke:
We can see now that the victim's blood is all over Mr McGilded's overcoat.
Susato:
But in the trial two months ago, the defendant said this in his testimony:
McGilded:
Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand.
Ryunosuke:
But if you look at this overcoat, it's clear... These stains couldn't have arisen from McGilded trying to pull the victim to his feet.
Susato:
No. If that was what had really happened, the blood wouldn't have splashed all over the front of the coat.
Ryunosuke:
The only explanation for this pattern of blood... ...is that it splattered over McGilded's coat when he stabbed the victim in the stomach!
(I've tried to run from the truth for long enough. But there's no escaping it now.)
(The true culprit in that case - Mr Mason's killer...was Magnus McGilded!)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
...That horrible case is solved at last. And I... I helped the man walk free from that trial! I used all that twisted testimony and all that sham evidence...to 'prove' his innocence! ......... (How could I have let that happen...?)
Gina:
.........
Iris:
Runo...did you believe him, though? Did you believe Mr McGilded was innocent?
Ryunosuke:
......... I believed... Or rather, I think I was trying to believe. I wanted to. Because believing in those you represent in court...is a defence lawyer's greatest weapon.
Iris:
A weapon...?
Susato:
.........
A lawyer's weapon (appears after "The truth of the omnibus case")
Ryunosuke:
Before we came to Great Britain, a great friend of mine taught me a valuable lesson...
Susato:
You mean Kazuma-sama?
Kazuma:
Listen, Ryunosuke. We lawyers are only human. We can't know for sure what is the truth and what is a lie. Which is why we must resort to our primary weapon: An unwavering belief in our clients. That's all we really have.
Ryunosuke:
...Unwavering belief?
Kazuma:
Only when we truly believe what our clients tell us, can we fight with everything we have for their cause. In any battle, there can be no victory without faith. So I believe you. Unwaveringly.
Gina:
......... Hehe...
Ryunosuke:
What's funny, Gina?
Gina:
Cor, sounds like in this Empire o' Japan you come from, everyone must be soft!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Gina:
Well, come on! Look at the mess it's got you into, believin' in that bogtrotter!
Ryunosuke:
Yes...I inadvertently helped a murderer walk free.
Susato:
.........
Gina:
Well at least you've learnt yer lesson now, eh? Believin' in people's never worth it. Someone always stabs you in the back in the end. Soon as you let down yer guard...you've 'ad it. Take a leaf outta my book: Believe no one, get 'urt by no one.

Gina's Representation Papers
Susato:
This one document...could be the key to Gina's fate. We must fight tooth and nail for her freedom! Tooth and nail!
Ryunosuke:
...You're very passionate about it, I see. (Not that I don't understand that.) You know...I was surprised to see how neatly Gina signed her name.
Susato:
Oh!
Ryunosuke:
You wouldn't have expected it from an orphaned East End pickpocket, would you?
Susato:
Well...this is Great Britain! With...a wonderful education system!
Ryunosuke:
Wait a minute... This was written with a fude brush. (And by a very skilled hand.)
Susato:
Ah...
Ryunosuke:
......... It was you who wrote it, wasn't it?
Susato:
Oh dear... Gina was insistent, so I... I couldn't refuse.
Iris's Story Manuscript
Ryunosuke:
'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... Iris's unpublished work...
Susato:
Yes, so Mr Sholmes was telling us all the truth. He did indeed deposit it for safekeeping with Mr Windibank.
Ryunosuke:
True. But then... (That still leaves the question of how Susato-san knew the full title.)
Susato:
......... I haven't read it myself, of course.
Ryunosuke:
Ah... No...
Susato:
...I realise I spoke carelessly last night. It was...a dreadful mistake.
Ryunosuke:
I know that you must have your reasons for not telling us any more.
Susato:
...I'm so sorry.
After clearing all Converse options:
Susato:
Gina...may I ask you something?
Gina:
Wot?
Susato:
I'd just like to make absolutely sure... What would you like us to do with these representation papers for tomorrow's trial?
Gina:
......... 'Ow many times do I 'ave to say it? Rip 'em up and chuck 'em away.
Susato:
Are you really sure that's what you want?
Gina:
I bet that's wot 'e wants an' all now. Mr 'I'm-a-Believer' Lawyer over there.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Gina:
Don't forget it was me in that trial two months ago. I led everyone up the garden path, didn't I? An' yer tellin' me you can believe in me after that? Not likely.
Susato:
......... Well, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
(A lawyer's primary weapon is an unwavering belief in his clients... Ultimately it comes down to whether or not I feel I can trust Gina after everything that's happened...)
I trust her
Leads to:
"Gina...let me say it again..."
I can't trust her
Ryunosuke:
(But what choice do I really have here? I have to believe in her. ...Although I can hardly believe myself that I'm making this choice in spite of everything. Let's just put it down to one of life's little curiosities...)
Leads to:
"Gina...let me say it again..."
Ryunosuke:
Gina...let me say it again... Please allow me to represent you in tomorrow's trial.
Gina:
Eh? Are you 'alf-baked?
Ryunosuke:
Not at all. You've not once admitted to committing the crime, have you? What's more...I believe that you're telling me the truth.
Gina:
......... Seriously, um...Mr Narrow-'Oddo... ...didn't you 'ear all of wot I said before? I'm a born liar. Fibs just trip off me tongue. And I'm a diver, don't forget. I pulled the wool over yer eyes two months ago and got you into all sorts o' trouble. Why would you ever trust me now? I just don't get it!
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
Gina...
Gina:
...!
Susato:
...I do understand why you choose not to put your trust in others. But I assure you, there is more to this life than you yet realise.
Gina:
Wot d'you mean?
Susato:
The world we live in... ...is full of people you would do very well to trust. People who won't ever let you down.
Gina:
Eh?
Ryunosuke:
It's true that I'm just a student of law, and I'm certainly lacking in courtroom experience. But I can promise you this: Whatever happens...and until my very last breath... ...I am completely on your side!
Gina:
......... Wot...wot d'you expect me to say to that? .........
Susato:
Then it's decided. I will take these papers now and carry out the necessary preparations for tomorrow's trial. It would be a shame to throw them away now after it's been penned with your name so beautifully.
Gina:
...Do wot you like. You Eastern lot are...are... I dunno wot you are! I don't get ya!
Ryunosuke:
(Gina's taken herself off to the back of her cell. She'd never admit it, but I hope she's feeling relieved. That turned out alright in the end...I think.)
...........................
Susato:
Whoever's hiding there... ...show yourself at once! Eavesdropping is the height of cowardice!
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato?!
Susato:
Somebody is there in the shadows. I can sense it. Somebody who wasn't there before!
Ryunosuke:
What?!
???:
......... ...Blimey, you're sharp, eh?
Gregson:
I s'pose you were usin' one of those mystic Japanese arts. Like the art of stealth I've heard so much about.
Ryunosuke:
...If anyone was being stealthy, it was you, Inspector.
Iris:
Gregsy!
Gregson:
Oh dear me, I am most terribly sorry, Your Ladyship! I didn't mean to startle you!
Iris:
How long have you been listening in on our conversation?
Gregson:
Good grief! Listenin' in?! No no no! I just got word that there were some visitors who were refusin' to leave even though it was after hours. I assure you, Your Ladyship, I only just arrived. This very minute! Not a moment earlier! That's all it is! Nothin' untoward! Nothin' at all!
Ryunosuke:
After hours...? Is it that late already?
Gregson:
So then, I'll humbly excuse myself now, Your Ladyship. Ta-ta! Toodle-oo! Cheerio! All the best! Bye, by and by!
Ryunosuke:
(That's a lot of farewells, and not one of them appropriate for 'Her Ladyship'.)
Iris:
Oh, but I wanted to have a chat!
Gregson:
I'm, I'm terribly sorry, but time is pressin' at the minute.
Iris:
Oh, I see. ...That's a shame.
Gregson:
If I don't get this emergency at the Supreme Court dealt with sharpish, Lord  Stronghart will, well...
Iris:
Emergency?!
Ryunosuke:
Lord Stronghart?
Gregson:
Nothin'! Forget I said anythin'! Anyway...ahem! I'm off!
Iris:
Alright, Gregsy, if you have to. But let's chat soon!
Gregson:
Delighted! Charmed! Can't wait! If you please! My pleasure!
Ryunosuke:
(That's a lot of pleasantries, and not one of them sounded sincere...)
Iris:
Gregsy's so funny! He says such silly things!
Ryunosuke:
It's certainly entertaining to see an inspector of the police fawning to a ten-year-old girl. (But anyway, I wonder what this emergency is at the Supreme Court...)
Susato:
I must attend the court clerk's office now before it closes.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course. Thank you, Miss Susato.
Susato:
......... Kindly escort Iris home now, Mr Naruhodo. I shall meet you there later.
Ryunosuke:
And so our investigation came to an end. Susato-san went to file the necessary papers for my defence of Gina the following day. And then it hit me... I could no longer suppress the wretched feeling that had been gnawing away at my insides. Tomorrow...Susato-san would be leaving. Leaving Britain and making her way back to Japan.

What about you, Susato-san? Today has been even more trying for you, I'm sure. (Mr Sholmes was shot before our eyes, Gina was arrested... ...all on the back of the news that her father has fallen ill and that she must return to Japan at once.) I...hope your father recovers soon.
Susato:
Thank you for your kind words. .........

Going back to Japan
Susato:
It's just two months since we arrived in London. But we've managed to establish this office. It was finally feeling as though we were settling in. I would be lying...if I said I felt no regret.
Ryunosuke:
I'm so sorry, Susato-san...
Susato:
It's just so sudden. I really don't know what to think. I've had no time to gather my thoughts.
Ryunosuke:
......... I know we've only been here a short time, but... ...in my limited experience of the courtroom, I feel I've learnt something.
Susato:
...And what would that be?
Ryunosuke:
It seems to me...there are many facets to people's personalities.
Susato:
Facets..?
Ryunosuke:
And like a jewel, the light plays off them in complex patterns, illuminating their actions and their motives. But we see only see [sic] a small number of the total facets. And what is illuminated is only a part of the whole story.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
What lies in the shadows? What do those facets we cannot see look like? Perhaps there are some parts we'll never lay eyes on, for as long as we live.
Susato:
That's so true.
Ryunosuke:
Sometimes I feel as though I'm blind to so much. But I keep hoping that one day it will all become clear. That all the facets will be illuminated, and I'll finally understand how everything fits together.
Susato:
Naruhodo-san...
Ryunosuke:
I suppose what matters... ...is that we keep our eyes open, and keep moving forward. Even if the way sometimes seems dark.
Susato:

Ryunosuke:
Sorry? I've what?
Susato:
Oh no...it was nothing. Unimportant.
Tomorrow's departure
Ryunosuke:
Do you know what time you will leave London in the morning?
Susato:
Yes, I picked up my ticket earlier. I shall be leaving here at 4 a.m.
Ryunosuke:
I see. Well, I'll escort you to the station.
Susato:
Absolutely not.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
I'm sure you realise why I couldn't possibly let you do that. You have a very important day ahead of you tomorrow.
Ryunosuke:
(Gina's trial...) Yes, I know, but-
Susato:
Every word you utter will have the potential to determine Gina's fate.
Ryunosuke:

Susato:
You must get as much rest as possible. Even though, like me, I'm sure you will find it hard to sleep. But please, for me...do try.
One final task
Ryunosuke:
Um...you mentioned 'one final task' a moment ago. What did you mean?
Susato:
Oh my! I nearly forgot! Please, I want you to have this.
Ryunosuke:
What is that? (Some huge bundle of documents...)
Susato:
It's my notes...from the case two months ago. The murder that was committed on the omnibus.
Ryunosuke:
...! (The McGilded case...)
Susato:
It seems to me that this case of Mr Windibank's murder - of which Gina is accused... ...is very much tied up with that omnibus case. In ways that are not yet completely apparent. So I took the liberty of consolidating my writings about the case for you.
Ryunosuke:
......... (With everything else she's had to think about... ...Susato-san's still managed to do this. And all neatly laid out for me in her beautiful handwriting.)
Susato:

Well...that's extremely flattering. But I'm sorry to say... ...that I've been a complete failure.

Oh no! Please, don't mention it. It's really nothing much. I simply implored Inspector Gregson for the police files and annotated all the documents they had... ...and then scoured the archives of every newspaper to pick out anything that might be relevant.
