October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4
Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.
Judge:
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.
Edgeworth:
First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.
Edgeworth:
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?
Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "Samurai Spear" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)
Skip it
Leads to:
"(I think I can probably remember that...)"
Listen again
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
Gumshoe:
I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
Leads back to:
"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?"
Phoenix:
(I think I can probably remember that...)
Judge:
So the murder weapon was a "spear"? How... medieval!
Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"
Judge:
Understood.
Edgeworth:
Let's call this security officer to the stand!
Edgeworth:
Will the witness declare her name?
Oldbag:
... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!
Edgeworth:
Y-your name, please!
Oldbag:
Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me "grandma."
Edgeworth:
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!
Phoenix:
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)
Oldbag:
Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.
Judge:
Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.
Oldbag:
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!
Edgeworth:
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?
Judge:
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?
Oldbag:
Yessey I was.
Judge:
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?
Oldbag:
You know your stuff, dearie!
Judge:
... You may begin your testimony.
Phoenix:
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!
Judge:
You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Cross Examination
-- Witness's Account --
Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?
Oldbag:
Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.
Phoenix:
(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)
Edgeworth:
Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?
Oldbag:
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
A "run-through"...?
Oldbag:
They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.
Phoenix:
(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)
Edgeworth:
If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?
Oldbag:
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What kind of "errands"?
Oldbag:
Oh, well, you know.
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
Oldbag:
Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?
Phoenix:
O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?
Oldbag:
Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)
Oldbag:
Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.
Maya:
Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!
Phoenix:
You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.
Maya:
Not a bad idea...
Oldbag:
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did you see the victim then?
Oldbag:
Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.
Edgeworth:
Tell us what happened next.
Oldbag:
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?
Oldbag:
O-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!
Phoenix:
No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...
Oldbag:
I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!
Maya:
"Snipperwhapper"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.
Phoenix:
Why don't you raise an objection?
Judge:
So, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?
Oldbag:
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How did you know that?
Oldbag:
Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)
Oldbag:
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
2:00? You're sure?
Oldbag:
Sure as spit!
Judge:
Well, who was the man!?
Oldbag:
Really, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.
Judge:
...
Oldbag:
Now, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!
Present Powers's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!"
Oldbag:
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you saw Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
That's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny?
Maya:
Nick, this is your chance!
Phoenix:
Yeah, time to pull out the secret weapon...
Oldbag:
I'll say it again! It was him!
Present Powers's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!"
Maya:
Nick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?
Phoenix:
Windbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.
Maya:
Ugh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?
Phoenix:
Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you "saw Mr. Powers," correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!
Judge:
J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?
Phoenix:
None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the "Mr. Powers" that you saw!?
Oldbag:
Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?
Edgeworth:
Um, yeah. ... Umm... well. I wonder?
Phoenix:
True, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!
Oldbag:
...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!
Judge:
No one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.
Phoenix:
(He's having trouble calling her "Oldbag" apparently...)
Judge:
However, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?
Oldbag:
Humph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!
Phoenix:
What!?
Edgeworth:
Huh!?
Phoenix:
(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)
Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!
Oldbag:
How was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me "this isn't any good as evidence, pal." He didn't even give it a second look!
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)
Judge:
Let's hear about your proof, then.
Witness Testimony
-- The Man in the Photo --
Oldbag:
I never say anything I don't mean, mind you!
That morning, during the run-through of the action scene...
I saw Powers trip and fall!
He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.
Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.
Now, look at that picture!
You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!
That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?
Judge:
Hmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.
Phoenix:
(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Umm...
Oldbag:
Whippersnapper!
Phoenix:
(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)
Oldbag:
I'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry...
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!
Phoenix:
(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)
Oldbag:
That morning, during the run-through of the action scene...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Who was present at the run-through?
Oldbag:
Well, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.
Judge:
And what exactly were you doing?
Oldbag:
Observing! Just... observing.
Phoenix:
What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.
Phoenix:
(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)
Oldbag:
I saw Powers trip and fall!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Trip and fall"...?
Oldbag:
Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.
Judge:
You... helped make it better?
Oldbag:
I kissed it where it hurt.
Judge:
L-let's just skip over that part, shall we?
Phoenix:
Where was the assistant then?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Edgeworth:
You may continue your testimony.
Oldbag:
He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
He broke a prop?
Oldbag:
Sure did! His own Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)
Oldbag:
Luckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.
Phoenix:
(This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.)
Samurai Spear updated in the Court Record.
Oldbag:
Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Was Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained?
Oldbag:
Not so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.
Phoenix:
(Thus the nap...)
Oldbag:
Anyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked.
Phoenix:
(Dragging his foot... okay.)
Oldbag:
You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)
Judge:
Hmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.
Oldbag:
See! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!
Oldbag:
That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Still, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Yes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!
Judge:
He has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.
Phoenix:
(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)
Maya:
Well, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?
Phoenix:
Well, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...
(Pressing second (or third) and fourth statements leads to:)
Edgeworth:
I think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?
Judge:
Well, there is one thing that bothers me.
Edgeworth:
Which is?
Judge:
Where is this "Steel Samurai" costume now?
Edgeworth:
Umm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
Anyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose that's right.
Phoenix:
(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)
Object
Phoenix:
Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.
Edgeworth:
Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...
Leads to:
"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?"
Wait and see what happens
Phoenix:
(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)
Judge:
I suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.
Edgeworth:
Most perceptive, Your Honor!
Phoenix:
(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)
Leads to:
"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?"
Edgeworth:
Will the witness continue her testimony, please?
Oldbag:
No need to ask twice!
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account, cont. --
Oldbag:
The time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?
The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!
No one else went there!
If they had, I would have seen them!
Judge:
Hmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this "Steel Samurai" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.

Phoenix:
How do you know that?
Oldbag:
Eh? Didn't I just explain? I gave donuts to the young detective. And the, after some rubbish about it being a "secret, pal" he told me everything.
Phoenix:
(I see Detective Gumshoe shares his fellow officer's fondness for donuts.)
Oldbag:
The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!

Oldbag:
Oh, quite, quite, sonny. Nobody suspicious lookin' passed by at all.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What about before you got to the guard station?
Oldbag:
You mean before 1:00? Why, everyone was in the Employee Area before then. And I locked the main gate so no one could get in. Not to mention...

Maya:
Old windbag sure has balls! Or... well, you know what I mean.
Phoenix:
Old windbags have a way of skipping over important details, after all... Or, for that matter, entirely forgetting them.
Maya:
How convenient.
Phoenix:
(Something for you to look forward to, perhaps?)
Phoenix:
Hold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?
Oldbag:
Yesiree, sonny.
Phoenix:
So, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?
Oldbag:
And here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.
Phoenix:
Right... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.
Oldbag:
Ooh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.
Phoenix:
That very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]
Oldbag:
Even I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!
Phoenix:
Actually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: "Photo #2"...
Oldbag:
"Photo #2"...?
Phoenix:
The computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be "Photo #1" if it really was the ONLY photo!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Actually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access... the security lady herself!
Oldbag:
Eh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers!
Phoenix:
But the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!
Oldbag:
Umm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean...
Judge:
Can the witness explain this to the court?
Oldbag:
Umm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help!
Edgeworth:
Huh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either.
Oldbag:
Humph! Some help you are! You're a whippersnapper too! ... ... Whippersnapper...?
Judge:
Something the matter, Ms. Oldbag?
Oldbag:
Ah! That's right! I... I just remembered something!
Judge:
Let me guess... Someone else passed by the gate... someone other than the Steel Samurai?
Oldbag:
Er... well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way.
Judge:
*sigh* I see. Your testimony, please.
Witness Testimony
-- The Other Person --
Oldbag:
Every day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do.
I go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.
I throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.
Come to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!
Edgeworth:
M-Ms. Oldbag! This is the first I've heard of this!
Oldbag:
Well, of course, sonny! I've only just remembered it.
Judge:
Right... anyway, Mr. Wright, please begin the cross-examination.
Maya:
Well, I'd say this was a turn for the unexpected, but I kind of expected this...

Phoenix:
Another "job"?
Oldbag:
T-that's right. I check all the people that passed by the main gate that day. I look closely at every one of the photos that security camera takes.
Edgeworth:
Do you backup all of the security camera data?
Oldbag:
Well, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating.
Oldbag:
I go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How many photos are there, usually?
Oldbag:
On a day when we're open to the public, we get more than 500 people. But on filming days or rehearsal days... well, we don't have much money. We never get more than 50, and that's a big day.
Edgeworth:
Do you backup all of the security camera data?
Oldbag:
Well, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating.
Oldbag:
I throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How exactly do you determine what isn't "suspicious lookin'"?
Oldbag:
Oh, you can tell by looking at their faces. For the most part.
Phoenix:
F-for the most part? This is a murder trial, Ms. Oldbag!
Oldbag:
Well, I didn't touch that suspicious lookin' Will Powers's photo, did I?
Phoenix:
(I think she's missing the point.)
Oldbag:
Come to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Leads to:
"Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?"
Maya:
"Come to think of it"? Couldn't she think of that a little earlier!?
Phoenix:
Classic old windbag maneuver, Maya.
Maya:
Hmm... Might be a useful tactic to remember for use in my future career as a windbag.
Phoenix:
(Let's find out more about this "erased" photo.)
Phoenix:
Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?
Oldbag:
Humph. A fanboy.
Phoenix:
F-fanboy?
Oldbag:
Steel Samurai fanboys. Real freaks, if you ask me. They get information about the rehearsals from gosh-knows-where. They're always hanging about. One was there that day.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
W-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? "I locked the main gate so no one could get in"... Those were your words!
Oldbag:
Well! If you must know, there's a drain that goes into the Employee Area. The grate has been loose for a while. It leads outside, and well, that's where they come in.
Phoenix:
They come in through the drain?
Oldbag:
I told you they were freaks. Oh, and...
Phoenix:
And...?
Oldbag:
They're kids. Children. Whippersnappers.
Phoenix:
K-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?
Oldbag:
It was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.
Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Judge:
O-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?
Oldbag:
Oh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em.
Edgeworth:
A boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?
Judge:
Impossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy.
Oldbag:
Right! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data.
Maya:
Um, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!
Phoenix:
Yeah, and they're already trying to "un-suspect" him.
Judge:
I'd like to take a five minute recess. I want the defense and the prosecution to consider this new information... And no forgetting vital information this time!

Phoenix:
Mr. WP?
Will:
Y-yes?
Phoenix:
Tell me straight: were you really in your dressing room? You didn't go to the studio?
Will:
I-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest.
Maya:
So who was the "Steel Samurai" in that security photo?
Will:
How should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really.
Maya:
What!? You should take better care of that stuff!
Will:
I couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me?
Phoenix:
It doesn't look good...
Will:

Phoenix:
You're the only likely suspect, right now.
Maya:
Nick! W-what are we going to do!?
Phoenix:
First, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this!
Maya:
Right! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day!
Phoenix:
Right... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot.
Will:
You... don't sound very optimistic.
Phoenix:
I'm not optimistic at all, actually.
Maya:
Hey, Nick. It's time.
Phoenix:
Okay. Let's go. *sigh*
Will:
What does that mean... Please don't sigh like that! *sniff*
Judge:
The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?
Edgeworth:
The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of "guilty" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?
Phoenix:
The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!
Judge:
Order! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.
Phoenix:
(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)
Judge:
So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?
The assistant girl
Phoenix:
It was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!
Judge:
So you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?
Phoenix:
That's correct, Your Honor!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
If you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!
Phoenix:
Oh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.)
Edgeworth:
Remember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!
Oldbag:
Powers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me.
Phoenix:
What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.
Edgeworth:
The assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!
Phoenix:
Ungh!
Maya:
That kind of takes the legs out from under that case...
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.
Phoenix:
(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)
Judge:
May we move on, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.
Judge:
Very well. Go ahead.
Leads back to:
"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?"
The grade-school boy
Phoenix:
It was the grade-school boy! ... ... ... Why isn't anyone saying anything?
Edgeworth:
Bah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? "Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe that was a dumb move on my part.)
Maya:
"Maybe"? "Maybe"!? How about "absolutely," Nick!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.
Phoenix:
(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)
Judge:
May we move on, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.
Judge:
Very well. Go ahead.
Leads back to:
"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?"
The security lady
Leads to:
"It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!"
Phoenix:
It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!
Oldbag:
W-who!?
Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!
Oldbag:
W-what!? Whippersnapper!
Judge:
Order! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!?
Oldbag:
Oldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you!
Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!
Judge:
W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?
Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!
Judge:
I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?
Edgeworth:
... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.
Oldbag:
W-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!
Phoenix:
(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)
Press further
Leads to:
"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case..."
Give granny a break
Phoenix:
(I guess this does kind of make it look like she's the killer. Funny, I feel bad for her all of a sudden.)
Judge:
Hmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.)
Leads to:
"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case..."
Phoenix:
The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!
Oldbag:
B-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?
Phoenix:
You forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.
Judge:
Hmm... Indeed.
Phoenix:
(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)
Oldbag:
Wait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!
Judge:
He's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?
Oldbag:
Th-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!
Judge:
Hmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
That boy is not the killer.
Oldbag:
What!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!
Phoenix:
I have proof.
Oldbag:
P-proof!?
Judge:
Indeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?
Present Cardkey
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?
Leads to:
"I see!"
Present Powers's(?) Photo or Samurai Spear
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible!
Leads to:
"I see!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is my proof!
Judge:
... I can't see how that has anything to do with this matter, Mr. Wright? Mr. Wright. There aren't that many pieces of evidence in the Court Record. Please try not to pick the wrong ones!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor.
Judge:
I'll ask again, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?"
Judge:
I see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this?
Oldbag:
Mrph.
Phoenix:
(The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.)
Judge:
Very well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name?
Edgeworth:
Something "Oldbag," Your Honor.
Judge:
Then the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned!
Oldbag:
W-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking!
Maya:
Oh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!
Judge:
Ms. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony?
Oldbag:
Actually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about.
Phoenix:
N-not to talk about?
Edgeworth:
By whom!?
Phoenix:
(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)
Judge:
W-well, testify!
Witness Testimony
-- My Lips Were Sealed --
Oldbag:
Global Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.
There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.
They said they had "nothing to do with it," see?
So they told me to just pretend they "hadn't been at the studios that day."
But if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!
Judge:
M-Ms. Oldbag! This is crucial information! Why did you keep this from the court until now!?
Oldbag:
Ain't you been listening? They told me to shut my trap, and I always do what I'm told.
Judge:
...
Phoenix:
(No, this isn't a bad dream, Your Honor. Witness the power of the Oldbag...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright... Your cross-examination.

Oldbag:
That's right! By the studio and TV bigwigs, no less!
Edgeworth:
Why didn't I hear about this!?
Oldbag:
Don't be too hard on yourself, sonny. We were all in on it.
Oldbag:
There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
W-who were these people!?
Oldbag:
Well, the director and the producer, for starters...
Phoenix:
The... director?
Edgeworth:
We should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course!
Oldbag:
Yes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it.
Phoenix:
So, where were these people?
Oldbag:
The director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that.
Edgeworth:
Where!
Oldbag:
Oh, in the Studio Two trailer.
Phoenix:
S-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?)
Oldbag:
Well, if you look at the guidemap... Here it is. You go through the gate and all the way to the left.
Phoenix:
(The path where the monkey's head was fallen over.)

Well, Mr. Wright... Would you like to continue the cross-examination...?
Phoenix:

Ms. Oldbag! This is a trial for murder!
Oldbag:
I know that, silly! Still, they were pretty convincing about having nothing to do with it. And... they gave me a little bonus on the side.
Phoenix:
(So, you got your "bonus" and you still talked... Hmm. I think I've asked all the questions I have to ask...)

Maya:
Nick! I guess pressing her was the right thing to do! For an old windbag, she sure likes keeping secrets... Let's get as much information as we can!
Phoenix:
Your Honor. We have learned there were others at Global Studios on the day in question. The director and the producer and, er, some bigwigs, were all present. Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point. The prosecution will gather more information about the witness, Ms. Oldbag... and more information about these other people we have just been told of!
Edgeworth:
... I understand, Your Honor.
Judge:
This ends the day's proceedings in the trial of Mr. Will Powers. That is all. The court is adjourned!

Will:
Th-thank you so much, Mr. Wright. I was right to ask you to defend me.
Maya:
Aww, really, it's nothing. *grin* Oh, or should I... *sniff*
Phoenix:
We'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination!
Maya:
So, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag?
Phoenix:
What do you think, Mr. Powers?
Will:
I don't think it was her, really.
Maya:
Neither do I, Nick.
Phoenix:
Y-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers.
Maya:
Poor old windbag... I feel kinda sorry for her.
Phoenix:
Well, she wasn't winning any points in there, with or without my accusation. Okay, let's get down to the studios.
Maya:
Right! We'll be back to visit you soon...
Will:
Th-thanks. Thanks, guys. *sniff*
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts.
Phoenix:
(W-what!? I see plenty of room! It’s still wide open... no?)
Judge:
This court find the defendant, Mr. Will Powers...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
