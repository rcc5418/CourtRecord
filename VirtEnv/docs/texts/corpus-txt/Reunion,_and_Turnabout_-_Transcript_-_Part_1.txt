That was... no accident... I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini?
Maya:
I finally get to see you again, and...
Phoenix:
It's not your fault. You didn't do it.
Maya:
No, I... I did it... I killed that person.
Phoenix:
But that wasn't you.
Maya:
It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me.
Phoenix:
(I can't believe something like this happened...The events of that gloomy, rainy afternoon that started this whole mess...keep playing through my mind...)
Episode 2Reunion, and Turnabout
June 16, 3:34 PMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
???:
What depressing rain...Do you understand how depressed that makes me!? Do you!?
Phoenix:
Uh, I guess...
???:
But actually, more than being depressed, I'm angry. Angry at that weather girl on TV. "I think our little rainy spell will take a break with a day of sun!"...is what that girl said! I'd stake my life on it!
Phoenix:
Well, it's the weather...
???:
But that's why I didn't bother to bring an umbrella today. What nerve, calling herself a weather girl! She's going to hear about my $1500 suit!
Phoenix:
Um... About your case... Unless you're planning on suing the weather girl...?
???:
... I'm sorry. I thought that before we got down to business, we could have some friendly chatter. My name is Dr. Turner Grey. I'm a surgeon.
Phoenix:
(Remind me never to end up under his knife...)
Grey:
I'm here today because of this incident.
Phoenix:
"Malpractice at Grey Surgical Clinic. Fourteen In-Patients Lose Their Lives!" ...Oh. You're... the doctor at...?
Grey:
It's really quite upsetting. Did you hear me!? UPSETTING!
Phoenix:
Yes, yes, I heard you. I agree, it's quite upsetting, Dr. Grey.
Grey:
The one that screwed up was that nurse! It was her that got the medications mixed up and killed those 14 patients! And yet! Now listen good! And yet! That nurse had the nerve to go and die before admitting to her wrongdoing! She didn't even offer any sort of explanation to me! And this is the kicker! She up and has herself a grand ol' accident and crashed her car! Smash! Crunch! Instantly transforming her car into the accordion model!
Phoenix:
(That's right... About a year ago, all the tabloid shows were talking about it. Fourteen victims of medical malpractice and the nurse's mysterious fatal accident. There were rumors that Dr. Grey had actually caused that crash. People said it was to forever hide the person responsible for the malpractice incident.)
Grey:
Why would I...? Now, I'm just going to say this once -- Why on Earth would I want to kill that nurse? She's the one who killed those 14 patients! Not me!
Phoenix:
I think you need to take a deep breath, doctor, and focus... More to the point, this case is over a year old. Why bring it up now...?
Grey:
That's simple! Because the situation is slipping out of my grasp. This just won't do. My clinic isn't seeing nearly as many patients nowadays. Do you understand what that means!? It means they're not coming to my clinic!
Phoenix:
(You don't say...? If it were me, I don't think I'd want to go either.) So... what would you like me to do about it...?
Grey:
I want you to help me prove I'm innocent.
Phoenix:
Um, you do realize I'm a lawyer, not a private investigator, right?
Grey:
No, this is something only you can do.
Phoenix:
...?
Grey:
Maya Fey. You know this girl, correct?
Phoenix:
...! (Maya! Why would he know her name...!?)
Grey:
I heard you were working under her for a little while.
Phoenix:
Well, yes... I mean... Hey, wait a second here! I worked UNDER her!?
Grey:
Yes. Am I wrong? She told me, so I'm not quite sure if...
Phoenix:
Well, we worked a few trials together. But she went back to her hometown to undergo more training.
Grey:
Ah, yes, I heard. It must be lonely for you.
Phoenix:
Wh-What!? Wait... I'm not...!
Grey:
She must be an extraordinary girl to handle such rigid training.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Grey:
I have an acquaintance who knows a lot about these mystical sorts of things. She's the one who introduced me to Ms. Fey.
Phoenix:
(Is Maya... really that famous...?)
Grey:
And I've already set up an appointment.
Phoenix:
For what?
Grey:
What else!? A channeling! I'm going to have her call the spirit of that nurse that went and got herself killed!
Phoenix:
O-Oh. (Maya... I wonder what she's up to right now...)
Maya:
We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums. It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us.
Phoenix:
(That's what she told me...I guess she's learned to accept her responsibilities and become an adult...)
Grey:
Not counting training, this will be her first time channeling a spirit, so she gave me one condition before accepting my request.
Phoenix:
A condition...?
Grey:
The condition is you, Mr. Wright. She said that she wouldn't do the channeling without first seeing you again.
Phoenix:
Me...?
Grey:
And that is why I've searched you out! You want to see her too, don't you!?
Phoenix:
(And so... that is how I ended up visiting Maya's hometown with the doctor...)
June 19, 1:25 PMKurain Village
Phoenix:
(So this is Kurain Village; Maya's hometown.)
???:
...
Phoenix:
W-Why, hello there.
???:
...
Phoenix:
Hmm... What an odd little girl.
???:
Hey! Wait up, Pearly!!
Phoenix:
(Hm? Someone else is coming this way...)
???:
Niiiiiiiick!
Phoenix:
M-Maya. How are you...? It's good to see you again.
Maya:
Wow, I didn't think you'd really show up!
Phoenix:
It's not that big a deal. You made it sound like you were soooo far away.
Maya:
Well, maybe I exaggerated... just a little.
Phoenix:
It was only 2 hours by train. If I had known you were this close, I'd have visited more.
Maya:
No! You're not allowed. I already decided, you know. Until I become an adult, I have to work hard and be strong by myself...
Phoenix:
Oh... well... Anyway, congratulations. I'm glad to hear training is going well for you.
Maya:
Heh, heh...
Examine
Phone booth
Phoenix:
It's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. My cell phone doesn't get reception up here, so who knows. I may need it later.
Bus shelter
Phoenix:
An old bus stop. It says "Kurain Village" on the sign post. The buses seem incredibly inconvenient since they only come 3 times a day.
Giant rock
Phoenix:
A giant rock that seems to be reaching for the sky. Its origins are written on a beat-up, old sign. It looks like this giant rock is called the "Kurain Boulder". There's a really complex explanation written here, but long story short, it's a big stone for spirits to live in... Or something like that...
Road and houses further
Phoenix:
Rustic, thatch-roofed houses where the other villagers live line the street. They're nowhere near as large or as nice as the manor in front of me. It's kind of odd that I don't see any of the other villagers walking around, though...
Fey manor
Phoenix:
The biggest, most elegant of the buildings I can see from here. This is Fey Manor; the place Maya calls home. It's easy to be overwhelmed by its presence...
Talk
Today's channeling
Phoenix:
Looks like you've finally become a full-fledged medium, taking on your first job.
Maya:
Yeah. I didn't think it would be this soon.
Phoenix:
But this case... Do you know the messy story behind it...?
Maya:
Ha ha ha, behold the power of the Maya Intelligence Network! Let's see. Fourteen people died because of malpractice on Dr. Grey's part, right? And to pin the blame on the nurse, he killed her in what appeared to be a car accident!
Phoenix:
Huh? Um, so what is this "Maya Intelligence Network" anyway...?
Maya:
The tabloids.
Phoenix:
That's what I thought.
Maya:
... Ha ha ha. I'm just pulling your leg, Nick! What really happened is the exact opposite. I heard all about it from Dr. Grey.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Oh, come on, Nick! I wouldn't take a crazed killer as a client! That's too scary, even for me.
Phoenix:
(Y-Yeah, I guess so.)
Kurain Village
Phoenix:
So this is your hometown, huh, Maya?
Maya:
Yup! Kurain Village... But I've heard people call this place "Medium Valley", too.
Phoenix:
Interesting... So everyone that lives here is a spirit medium?
Maya:
Pretty much. Most of my ancestors were too, I think...
Phoenix:
(That's probably true since the Fey ability to communicate with the dead is so strong...)
Maya:
Actually, only the women of this village are mediums.
Phoenix:
So what do the men do?
Maya:
They usually work someplace outside the village.
The girl earlier
Phoenix:
Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you about that girl I saw earlier. Do you know her?
Maya:
Oh, you mean Pearly?
Phoenix:
Pearly?
Maya:
Pearl Fey. She's my cousin. Isn't she adorable? Just like yours truly!
Phoenix:
Cousin... Wait, then that means... Is she also a...?
Maya:
Yup. She's a medium, too. Pearly's a real genius when it comes to channeling!
Phoenix:
Hmm, I see. I hope I didn't scare her when I tried to talk to her earlier.
Maya:
Nah, it's not you. My aunt drilled it into her head that "if a suspicious-looking person tries to talk to you, run away".
Phoenix:
S-Suspicious-looking...!?
Maya:
Well, you're not wearing training clothes, for starters...
Phoenix:
Of course not.
Maya:
Pearly is my aunt's most valued treasure, so she's not allowed to go outside of town. She doesn't know much about the world outside of Kurain Village.
Phoenix:
Aunt?
Maya:
Pearly's mother is my aunt, duh. Come on, Nick.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Maya:
Ah, it's good to see this tarnished badge again.
Phoenix:
What do you mean by "tarnished"...?
Maya:
Well, look. This badge is like every other. It's bound to lose its color and shine after years and years. But you know, polishing it up once in a while wouldn't be a bad idea.
Maya Fey profile
Maya:
Ha ha ha. I'm warning you! I'm not the same weak Maya you knew a year ago, Nick!
Phoenix:
You seem to have a lot of faith in yourself.
Maya:
You'll see soon enough. I think you'll be totally shocked by how good my hamburgers are now!
Phoenix:
(Were you training to be a medium or a cook?)
Turner Grey profile
Maya:
Hey, it's my client!
Phoenix:
"Client," huh? You're really serious about your work, aren't you?
Maya:
I thought I'd say it once, just to try it out, like how you always say, "My client."
Any other evidence
Maya:
Hmm, nothing really comes to mind, Nick.
Phoenix:
Don't say that with such a big smile on your face.
Maya:
Ha ha. What can I say? I'm in a good mood today.
Any other profiles
Phoenix:
What do you think about this person?
Maya:
Hey, have I told you this one yet, Nick? We have a legend in this village. It goes like this. "All the woman of the Fey clan are beauties." Well?
Phoenix:
...And that's a legend now?

(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Maya:
Well, Nick, I've got to get going. It's about time for the channeling to start.
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, yeah...
Maya:
I'm doing the channeling in my house, so come on in, OK? After I'm done, we can grill up some juicy burgers!
Phoenix:
Alright. Good luck, Maya.
Maya:
Thanks!
Phoenix:
(Well... At least she's still the same perky Maya.)
June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room
Grey:
Ah, Mr. Wright. I'm so glad you showed.
Phoenix:
Some nice weather we're having today. Aren't you happy?
Grey:
No, not at all. That stupid weather girl made the wrong call again. "It will rain cats and dogs today!" she said with a straight face. I can't believe they allow such misguided reports on the public airwaves!
Phoenix:
(Looks like talking about the weather with this guy is just asking for punishment...)
Grey:
...But anyway, this is a splendid manor.
Phoenix:
(No argument there... It's hard to believe that this is Maya's house, though...)
Grey:
I was given a guidemap to this building. Here, Mr. Wright. I have a copy for you too.
Guidemap added to the Court Record.
Examine
Door
Phoenix:
A door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. It looks like there is a strong lock on this door to top it off.
Writing on top of the door
Phoenix:
Someone with a lot of skill wrote these four Chinese characters with a brush. Oh look, here's a translation: "Once in a Lifetime." Its message is people should value their ghostly meetings as once in a lifetime chances.
Blue board
Phoenix:
A piece of cloth with a ton of finely-written characters jammed onto it. Probably esoteric knowledge only mediums should know. ...Hmm, let's see... Here's one in English... It says... "100 Ways to Save Money". ... Being a medium sounds like a rough way of life...
Door to the Winding Way
Phoenix:
This door leads out to the Winding Way. The weather outside looks really nice.
Talk
Today's channeling
Phoenix:
What are you going to do once the nurse's spirit has been called?
Grey:
Isn't it obvious? I'm going to have her write a signed confession.
Phoenix:
A signed confession?
Grey:
Yes, a confession. Pay attention! I'll have her write this: "One year ago, on May 2nd, 14 patients died due to my negligence. And then, on May 24th, I fell asleep at the wheel and died in a car accident due to my further negligence. I'm sorry and I apologize for being negligent." That's what I'll have her write! With a confession, the rain falling on my soul can finally stop.
Phoenix:
O-Oh, I see...
Maya
Phoenix:
So, how did you hear about Maya Fey...?
Grey:
I heard about her from an acquaintance; a girl studying the occult at the college. That girl introduced me to this village. This is the home of the Kurain School of Channeling.
Phoenix:
The home, huh...?
Grey:
And Ms. Maya is a daughter of the "Master", I hear.
Phoenix:
Master...?
Grey:
Anyway, do you see that door? That's the room where people and spirits meet. Ms. Maya's aunt is in there right now. Would you care to meet her...?
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Look, here's my attorney's badge.
Grey:
Are you trying to compete with me and my profession with that piece of scrap?
Phoenix:
...Uh...
Grey:
I am a surgeon. Compared to you lawyers, I'm practically a saint! Yes, well, I don't exactly have any patients right now, but, and listen good! I'm not the one that made the mistake!
Phoenix:
(This doctor needs his head examined...)
Guidemap (Fey Manor)
Phoenix:
Wow, this manor is really nice, don't you think?
Grey:
Do you honestly think this place is all that impressive? Don't make me laugh.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Grey:
This is the countryside. Land here is dirt cheap. I will have something much greater one day! I will build my own grand mansion! Did you hear me!? A grand MANSION! This manor will seem like nothing!
Phoenix:
(Uh, could you keep that shaking fist away from my face? Thanks...)
Maya Fey profile
Grey:
She's still young, but one day, she'll bear a big responsibility. She'll be the Master, you know. The MASTER!
Phoenix:
(I guess there are "Master" mediums, too...)
Morgan Fey profile
Grey:
That's Ms. Maya's aunt. Earlier, she made me eat some sort of traditional dessert the size of a tea saucer! Hmm, I wonder if Ms. Morgan ever performs channelings herself...?
Any other profile
Phoenix:
What do you have to say about this person, Dr. Grey?
Grey:
...This person... Hmm... Judging by their face...
Phoenix:
W-What is it?
Grey:
They have a weak stomach.
Phoenix:
R-Really...

(Wow... It's such a strange atmosphere in here... These flickering lights... I guess they're candles...)
???:
Good sir! Who might you be...?
Phoenix:
Aaah! I-I'm, uh, my name is Phoenix Wright...
???:
Oh... You must be that good sir...
Phoenix:
("Good sir"...? Is she talking about me?)
???:
You are a lawyer, are you not, good sir? I have heard much about you from Mystic Maya.
Phoenix:
Is that so? ("Mystic" Maya...?)
???:
I am Mystic Maya's aunt, Morgan Fey.
Phoenix:
N-Nice to meet you.
Morgan:
Ah, I had wanted to speak with you about a certain incident, good sir. It would seem that perhaps you ask too much of Mystic Maya in performing your duties. Most unbecoming, I'm afraid.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Morgan:
Don't tell me you have already forgotten? That was it not for Mystic Maya and her assistance, you would surely not have won...
Phoenix:
(First a girl that runs away, and now an old lady who says I stink at doing my job... When did I become the poster boy for "How Not to Make a First Impression"...?)
Morgan:
The past is the past though. Let us speak of the present now.
Phoenix:
...Ah, thank you...
Examine (left side)
Door
Phoenix:
The Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. There is a giant iron lock where the handle is. It feels like a curtain that separates the normal world from the spirit one.
Floor panels
Phoenix:
This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air.
Examine (right side)
Altar
Phoenix:
I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important. A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement.
Morgan:
Good sir! I wonder if you would please not touch the sacred objects. Those objects are being offered to the spirits. If you were to touch them, good sir, they would become cursed. Yes, cursed.
Phoenix:
(She really didn't have to talk down to me. I'm not that much of an idiot...)
Folding screen
Phoenix:
This folding screen is really showing its age. All of its edges are a bit tattered. The lettering is fading too. I think I recognize a few of the characters on here... ...Ku ...ra ...in... I'm pretty sure that's what it says... Maybe I'll ask Maya about it later...
Behind the folding screen
Phoenix:
There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark.
Talk
Maya
Phoenix:
So why do you add "Mystic" to Maya's name. Isn't that a little... strange?
Morgan:
Good sir!
Phoenix:
Yes!
Morgan:
How dare you be so rude and disrespectful towards Mystic Maya!
Phoenix:
I-I'm sorry.
Morgan:
She must be addressed by her proper title, good sir. You must call her "Mystic Maya"!
Phoenix:
Um, uh... So, about Mystic Maya... Uh...
Morgan:
It is the blood.
Phoenix:
Excuse me? "Blood"?
Morgan:
Mystic Maya carries the blood of the Master. In actuality, she is the only one remaining.
Phoenix:
(Only one remaining...? What's that supposed to mean?)
Morgan:
Mystic Maya is the last of the rightful heirs of the Kurain Channeling Technique.
Phoenix:
OK... Then... where do you stand...?
Morgan:
That is a little more complicated... Although a woman of the Fey family, I am merely a member of the branch family.
Phoenix:
...Branch family? What's that?
Morgan:
It is as it sounds. For a member of the branch family, no matter her spiritual power, she can never become the Master of the Kurain School.
Phoenix:
So... how strong are you...?
Morgan:
... It is a shame, however I will admit. I can not even begin to compare the lowliness of my power to the Master's.
Phoenix:
(So that's how it is...)
Today's channeling
Phoenix:
So today's channeling will be her first?
Morgan:
Yes, good sir. Because the spirit of a person who dies in a traffic accident is usually very strong, it is usually easier to call that person to our world.
Phoenix:
("Traffic accident" indeed.)
Morgan:
The channeling will take place here, in this Channeling Chamber, good sir. As you can see, I am in the process of preparing.
Channeling Chamber
Phoenix:
So... this room is the... Channeling Chamber...?
Morgan:
The place where a spirit medium speaks with those who have departed.
Phoenix:
I don't suppose you'd mind if we observed the session...
Morgan:
Do not even think of such nonsense! Only the medium and the client may enter here.
Phoenix:
O-Oh.
Morgan:
The secrets of the Kurain Techniques can not be seen by just anybody.
Phoenix:
(That never stopped Maya from doing it in front of me before...)
Morgan:
It is also for your safety, good sir, if something were to go wrong. That is why, while channeling is being performed, that heavy door is securely locked...
Phoenix:
Oh, that's what the lock is for...
Present
Maya Fey profile
Morgan:
Good sir!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes!
Morgan:
When did you... take a hidden picture of Mystic Maya!?
Phoenix:
Wh-Wh-What!? Wait... It's not like that at all!
Morgan:
It is unforgivable!
Phoenix:
Ow-ow-ow! (Why did she slap me?)
Turner Grey profile
Phoenix:
About this person...
Morgan:
Oh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man.
Phoenix:
Insignificant...?
Morgan:
That would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir.
Phoenix:
(Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?)
Anything else
Morgan:
Good sir!
Phoenix:
Ack!
Morgan:
We would like to begin the channeling at 3 o'clock. If you don't mind, good sir, would you mind allowing me to make preparations?
Phoenix:
Uh, um, sure... go ahead... (She's a Fey alright! Just as odd as the rest.)
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Morgan:
... Oh, yes. I wonder if you have yet to meet Pearl, good sir.
Phoenix:
Pearl?
Morgan:
She is an adorable, angelic young girl.
Phoenix:
Oh, that odd...
Morgan:
She is my daughter. Now then, what was it you were about to say...?
Phoenix:
Wh-What a cute daughter you have... Ahaha...
Morgan:
A pure heart that knows not of the evils in this world is a powerful thing, good sir. Please refrain from affiliating with her, I request.
Phoenix:
(Well, it's not like I had the chance to anyway...)
Morgan:
I must insist and stress that you not let it occur.
Phoenix:
Okay, okay, I get it!
June 19Fey ManorWinding Way
Phoenix:
(Wow. This garden is really breath-taking. Someone put a lot of love into it. What is that over there...? ...Is that an incinerator? It looks a little out of place in a garden like this...)
Examine
Garden
Phoenix:
A splendid garden with a small lamp and traditional decorations. It's a bit small to walk around in... Although, that incinerator piques my curiosity...
Incinerator
Phoenix:
It's a small incinerator. I don't think garbage trucks come all the way out here to a little village like this. So every family has to burn their own trash.
Side room
Phoenix:
It looks like there's a room over there, too. A peaceful feeling is emanating from it.
Urn
Phoenix:
It's a really old urn. The ashes of a person long dead are inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on.

Side Room

Fey Manor
Side Room
June 19Fey ManorSide Room
Phoenix:
(So this is... the Side Room. Looks like it's more of a break room. There is bedding spread out on the floor. It looks like someone's sleeping in one. I shouldn't disturb them...)
Examine
Wooden bear sculpture
Phoenix:
It's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. "Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling" What the!? It's a souvenir. So does this mean it's easy to spot bears here... And for them to spot you...? *gulp*
Alcove
Phoenix:
It's a small alcove. I have no idea what it's supposed to mean or symbolize. If I had one of these in the office, it would end up as storage space. But here, it's decorated with some pretty flowers and a beautiful hanging scroll.
Sliding door
Phoenix:
This is the first time I've seen a sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard.
Bed on right
Phoenix:
There's bedding spread out on the floor. Is that someone sleeping in one over there? She's probably an exhausted medium taking a break and catching some z's. If I wake her up, she might be grumpy and throw a spell on me. It's probably a good idea to not disturb her sleep...

Um... You... are... uh...
Lotta Hair
Phoenix:
Um, Lotta Hair, was it?
???:
L-L-Lotta Who!? Wait, you best not be making fun of my hair, now!
Phoenix:
Ah, no, um, I wasn't "making fun"... I was "complimenting" you on your fine hair...
???:
Hmph, I dare say yer one heartless man, Mr. Wright. It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty. But looks like you already forgot that.
Phoenix:
Hold up... ou were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak...
???:
Minor detail. Stop being so uptight; lettin' little things get in the way. The name's Hart. Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it!
Phoenix:
Oh yeah! That's it!
Lotta:
Now listen here. I'm here to take some pictures today. Gonna get myself a real scoop.
Phoenix:
Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.
Lotta:
You betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous "paranormal photographer"!?
Leads to:
"Oh, that's right!"
Lotta Hart
Phoenix:
You're Lotta Hart, right...?
Lotta:
Bingo! I'm the one and only "paranormal photographer", Lotta Hart!
Phoenix:
Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.
Lotta:
Of course! And today, I'm gonna get myself a real scoop! You wait and see!
Leads to:
"Oh, that's right!"
Who are you again?
Phoenix:
Sorry, but who are you again?
???:
Oh Lawdy! I've met some cold men in my days, but you... You're in an icebox of yer own!
Phoenix:
Come on, am I really that bad...?
???:
Put yer noggin to some use! You've gotta remember who I am! It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty.
Phoenix:
Ah! You're the one from that trial!
???:
See, I knew you could remember if you tried!
Phoenix:
You were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak...
???:
Why don't we let bygones be bygones, now. It's yesterday's news, right? Name's Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it, ya hear!?
Phoenix:
Um... So what brings you here today?
Lotta:
Hah! You should already know! I'm here for the big scoop! I can feel it!
Phoenix:
Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.
Lotta:
You betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous "paranormal photographer"!?

Oh, that's right! This ain't no time to be wastin' time! The channeling's about to get started!

We all should hurry up and get to the Meditation Room. ...What are you waiting around for!? Come on!

Morgan:
We will now begin the channeling. Mystic Maya and honored guest, please proceed into the Channeling Chamber.
Grey:
With this, I can finally swat all those pesky flies, once and for all! You hear me!? They won't be able to say a single bad thing about me after this! You would love to hear them apologize, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
Me!? Oh, uh, yeah, I sure would.
Morgan:
Mystic Maya, do you have the Channeling Chamber key?
Maya:
Yup, right here.
Morgan:
That is most satisfactory. That key is one-of-a-kind, so please take care of it well.
Maya:
It'll be fine, Aunt Morgan. I won't lose it, trust me! OK, Dr. Grey. Let's get started.
Grey:
Finally! Let's go!
*click*
Morgan:
Now let us wait patiently out here for them. Please have some lovely bitter green tea and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts...
Lotta:
Hold on, now, granny!
Morgan:
...Granny?
Lotta:
How come we ain't allowed in that room!?
Morgan:
Dear madam, you have an "impressive" grasp of English. From where did you learn it?
Lotta:
What!? I'm from the heart of the heartland!
Morgan:
Is that so? Then I humbly request that you return to this "Heart of the Heartland".
Lotta:
Wh-What are ya...?
Morgan:
This is Kurain Village. If you can not follow our traditions and rules, we request that you leave!
Lotta:
...! ... Sorry.
Phoenix:
(Wow. She shut Lotta up! Now THAT's impressive!)
Morgan:
Now then, let us wait.
*BANG*
Lotta:
Hey now! Wh-What was that just now!?
Phoenix:
(It came from inside the Channeling Chamber...)
*BANG*
Lotta:
Hey! Th-That's a gunshot!
Morgan:
E-Excuse me!?
Lotta:
I've heard that sound before. It's a gunshot! I'd bet my afro on it!
Phoenix:

Break into the Chamber
Lotta:
Well, Mister Lawyer! What's the plan!?
Phoenix:
What else!? We're going to break in!
Lotta:
What!? But... But there's only one key and that kid's got it.
Phoenix:
We're going to have to break the door. Is that alright, Ms. Fey?
Morgan:
Well, yes... But there is one matter... That is...
Phoenix:
Don't try to stop me! You can send the repair bill to the Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices later!
Leads to:
"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!"
Ask Morgan what to do
Phoenix:
Ms. Fey! What should we do!?
Lotta:
Yellow-bellied chicken liver! What are ya waiting for!? Kick it down already!
Phoenix:
But... The key...
Morgan:
That key is one-of-a-kind. In this world, there is only that one. Even I am powerless to open that door.
Phoenix:
(Hmm, there is really no other way...) Alright. Stand aside! I'm going to break the door down!
Morgan:
W-Wait! Please! That sort of recklessness...

Hey, Mister. That gal... Maya. She wasn't the one that pulled the trigger, was she...?
Phoenix:

Lotta:
Then again... Weren't there only the two of 'em in there? I reckon she musta done it then...
Dr. Grey
Phoenix:
Lotta, what do you know about Dr. Grey?
Lotta:
Not much, but I did some digging... That's one gent with a bad reputation.
Phoenix:
Really?
Lotta:
I hear he's good at surgery and stuff, but his personality stinks like wet sheep.
Phoenix:
(I sort of got the same impression myself...)
Lotta:
He's real controllin'. Soon as his nurse or patients don't do what he says, he starts a-hollerin'. Musta been real rough to work for him.

Phoenix:
What are you doing all the way out here, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
It's actually kinda funny. I was in the area for a business trip, pal. Well, time to check out the crime scene. I'll have to question everyone here later on, so just sit tight, alright?

Lotta:
Curses and ghosts and stuff comin' back to get ya... This is just too much, I say.
Phoenix:
What is too much?
Lotta:
Being an occult photographer. That's some scary stuff, so I think I'm gonna try being a celebrity photographer, now.

Gumshoe:
You can ask more about her later, pal. Right now, I've got a job to do and that's collecting evidence.

He was shot in the forehead. But...

Um, like, so... I was the one who told Dr. Grey about this place. He asked me, like, "Do you know of a good spirit medium?"

(Hmm, Dr. Grey did say something about being introduced to this place.)
Ini:
Cause, like, talking to dead people and, like, multiple personalities are my thing...
Phoenix:
I see... Then why were you taking a nap here?
Ini:
Like... I wasn't feeling good.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ini:
I'm, like, allergic to sesame seeds. They, like, must've put some in the food they served for lunch.
Phoenix:
Oh, that doesn't sound fun.
Ini:
So I, like, felt sick, and came in here to, like, sleep. I totally feel, like, I've wasted my time 'cause I, like, slept a long time.
What happened
Phoenix:
So you were sleeping here the entire time?
Ini:
Yeah. Ever since lunch...
Phoenix:
So you don't know anything about the murder that took place?
Ini:
Like, what? Oh, that! I, like, totally know nothing. So who was, like, you know, killed...?

The surgeon that requested the channeling, Dr. Grey.

Actually, my mother is for now. But since that title is passed from mother to daughter, I guess I will be someday...
Phoenix:
But many people think that channeling isn't real, that it's all just an act.
Maya:
You believe in us, don't you?
Phoenix:
Yeah... because I've seen it with my own eyes. (When Maya's channeling a spirit... not only her voice, but her whole physical appearance changes. It's a supernatural phenomenon that occurs every time. It happened this time, too... Dr. Grey said that he wanted to call the nurse, so... Maya's body must have taken on that nurse's appearance...)
What happened
Phoenix:
What exactly happened in the Channeling Chamber?
Maya:
... I went into that room with Dr. Grey, locked the door... and sat down across from him.
Phoenix:
OK...
Maya:
We closed our eyes...and I began the channeling.
Phoenix:
(This is sounding kind of creepy... like the beginning of a scary story...)
Maya:
And that's the last thing I remember...
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
After a spirit comes into my body, I lose my self, my consciousness.
Phoenix:
Then, you don't remember a single thing?
Maya:
When I came to, I was being held in my aunt's arms. And there was blood... all over my clothes.

What kind of dream did you have while you were channeling...?

Um... I can't remember it all that well, but... I was dead and buried in the ground. I couldn't move... and it was unbearable... Really suffocating... ...It went something like that.
Phoenix:
I... I see... (I have no idea what to say to that...)

This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air. No matter what I do, my eyes keep getting drawn to the pool of blood in the center here.
Examine (right side)
Altar
Phoenix:
I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important. A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement. I'd guess they're used during the channeling...
Folding screen
Phoenix:
It's a beautiful and expensive folding screen. It also looks quite old. There seems to be some sort of sacred text written on it, but I can't read it. ...&#160;! Th-This is... It's a hole! Could this have been made by a bullet?
Folding Screen added to the Court Record.
Behind the folding screen
Phoenix:
There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. I hope no one is hiding back there.
Talk
What happened
Phoenix:
I would like to ask you a few questions about what happened yesterday.
Morgan:
Do you mean that awful tragedy?
???:
That man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him...
Phoenix:
M-Maya?
Step away from there!
Morgan:
Please leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police!
Phoenix:
What happened here in this room after I left?
Morgan:
Well... First, I struck Mystic Maya on the head.
Phoenix:
To make her go unconscious, correct?
Morgan:
That is correct. Next, I performed the Spirit Severing Technique.
Phoenix:
"Spirit Severing Technique"?
Morgan:
The spirit of that nurse was inside of Mystic Maya's body. I used the technique to send the nurse's spirit back to the other world.
Phoenix:
(I wonder if this kind of testimony is even admissible in a court of law...)
Channeling Chamber
Phoenix:
By the way, what is this room exactly...?
Morgan:
The Channeling Chamber? This room was created for the sole purpose of preventing such a tragedy as yesterday.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Morgan:
Sometimes, when an inexperienced medium calls an especially strong spirit, that spirit may become violent and revolt, as you witnessed yesterday.
Phoenix:
Revolt? But how?
Morgan:
When a spirit enters a medium's body, she loses her will and her self steps aside. To put it another way, the spirit is borrowing the medium's body, good sir.
Phoenix:
But isn't that extremely dangerous?
Morgan:
An experienced medium has little problem controlling a spirit.
Phoenix:
But Maya... I mean, Mystic Maya... That was her first channeling...
Morgan:
And that was why I insisted on locking the door. However, I never thought that would be calling danger upon the client himself... I am grateful that one of our heirlooms was not damaged in this horrible incident.
Phoenix:
And that is...?
Morgan:
It is that folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings. Along with the Kurain Sacred Urn, they are this village's most treasured possessions. If I ever found out that something had happened to either one... Oh, the inhumanity...
Phoenix:
(Odd for her to be worrying about the folding screen at a time like this... I guess this isn't just some dilapidated old screen after all...)
Pearl
Phoenix:
So... How is Pearl today...?
Morgan:
Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
Morgan:
In this world, Pearl is my most treasured possession. When compared to even Mystic Maya, Pearl has the spiritual power to become a Master.
Phoenix:
Th-That's very impressive.
Morgan:
Until now, the women of the branch family have thought themselves to be inferior. .. But. Pearl is different! Her spiritual strength is so great; even greater than some of the main family! Yes, Pearl is a channeling prodigy and is the pride of the branch family!
Phoenix:
(Wow... She's really fired up now...)
Morgan:
In any case... Our world is so different from yours, perhaps it is best for you to quit, good sir.
Phoenix:
"Quit"? Quit what?
Present
Maya's Magatama
Morgan:
...Oh my!
Phoenix:
Wh-What is it?
Morgan:
That... That is Mystic Maya's Magatama. Why would you have this in your possession!?
Phoenix:
I-I'm sorry!
Morgan:
Return it to Mystic Maya at once!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, madam! (Why did I feel like I was being scolded by my own mother just now...?)
Folding Screen
Morgan:
Ah, so even someone such as yourself can take interest in something like this. This is the Kurain Channeling Technique Sacred Writings. There are 6 panels in all.
Phoenix:
I see... But that's not what caught my eye. You see this hole here...?
Morgan:
It is an old screen, you see. It is only logical that perhaps a bug or worm of some sort is the culprit.
Phoenix:
(Even though this looks nothing like the eating patterns of any bug I know...)
Maya Fey profile
Morgan:
I can hardly believe Mystic Maya has become like this. Directly influenced by the likes of you, and becoming caught up in a situation such as this...
Phoenix:
I'm sorry... (...Hey, hold on! How is all this MY fault!?)
Morgan:
I told her so many times, as I have also told Pearl, "Do not associate with strange old men you don't know".
Phoenix:
(Well, that shouldn't apply to me then, especially since I'm hardly an "old man" yet!!)
Turner Grey profile
Morgan:
That doctor was one of those people. Those who intend harm upon the spirits receive harm in return; it's karma at work. It seems that he was the one to take the nurse's life, wouldn't you agree?
Phoenix:
(I guess that's possible...)
Pearl Fey profile
Morgan:
Good sir!
Phoenix:
Y...Yes?
Morgan:
When did you take this picture!? This is one of those... what are they called...? Those... "hidden camera" pictures!
Phoenix:
N-No!! It's not one of those at all!!
Morgan:
Such an unforgivable offense! You will hand it over to me!
Phoenix:
N-No! I won't! (If I ever want to talk about Pearl again, I should be much more careful...)
Morgan Fey profile
Morgan:
It shows the same face as the one I see in the mirror every day.
Phoenix:
And? Anything else?
Morgan:
No. That is all.
Phoenix:
(Why in the world did I bother to show this to her!?)
Any other evidence
Morgan:
I will be leaving shortly to meet with Mystic Maya. I simply do not have the time to look at such trivial matters.
Any other profile
Morgan:
We usually do not welcome strangers into our village as they disturb the aura here. Especially people like you, good sir.
Phoenix:
H-Hey, what do you mean, "especially people like me?"
Morgan:
You selfishly make Mystic Maya help you with your work... You should be thankful I have not taken your life for such a disrespectful act.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, madam...
Morgan:
And even more importantly, remember that if anything were to happen to Pearl...
Phoenix:
(What is that supposed to mean!?)
(Clearing all "Talk" options and examining folding screen leads to:)
Morgan:
Well, then, I do believe it is time for me to take my leave.
Phoenix:
Alright. Please tell Maya I said hi.
Morgan:
What was that!?
Phoenix:
Uh, I mean, Mystic Maya.
Morgan:
I will tell her.
Phoenix:

Ini:
"Smith", "Wright"... Well, I got, like, three letters, at least.
Phoenix:
(I don't think she gets the point...) Anyway, why are you here?
Ini:
So, like, I study this thing called "parapsychology" at this college and...
Phoenix:
Um, you told me about that yesterday. The sesame allergy, too. What I'd really like to know is why you're still here today?
Ini:
Oh! So, like, that's what you meant! Like, you shoulda been more, like, clear about it!

Wooden bear sculpture
Phoenix:
It's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. "Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling" What the!? It's a souvenir.
Ini:
Isn't it cuuuuute? I, like, totally bought that!
Phoenix:
Ah... so it's yours, huh?
Ini:
Yeah. So, like, this village is really famous for, like, channeling and bears.
Phoenix:
Heh. (...Wait. Famous for bears!?)
Ini:
But it's, like, OK. If you ever, like, see a bear, you just play dead, and they, like, leave you alone.
Phoenix:
I-Is that right?
Ini:
Yeah. Cause, like, fighting back is totally of no use.
Phoenix:
(Has she actually tried to fight one!?)
Yellow box
Phoenix:
Hmm, now where did this box come from? I'm sure this wasn't here last night. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom.
Talk
Ini Miney
Phoenix:
So? Why are you still here today?
Ini:
Like, there's so much for me to, like, study here!
Phoenix:
Like what?
Ini:
Like, the medium's training, or like, how they inherit their spiritual power.
Phoenix:
(I suppose... This village is the real thing, after all.)
Ini:
So, like, I asked if I could stay here for, like, a little longer.
Phoenix:
(She sure seems like the care-free type, at least, on the surface...)
What happened
Phoenix:
Have you heard about the murder?
Ini:
It's, like, totally scary.

About the victim, Dr. Grey...
Ini:
I don't know who you're talking about. ...Like... Wait, I think you asked about him, like, yesterday, too...
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You and Dr. Grey knew each other, right?
Ini:

Phoenix:
Oh really...? That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...

Huh!? ...Well, uh... Like, a long, long time ago... I was, like, a patient, yeah.

I know who you are. You're... You're Mystic Maya's... "special someone"...

So then... Of course! You're going to help Mystic Maya, aren't you? That's what you're going to do, right?

Pearl:
Usually when people don't use Mystic Maya's title, I get mad.
Phoenix:
O-Oh, sorry.

But if it's you, Mr. Nick, then it's OK. Because... Because... you're "special" to her.
Phoenix:
(Where in the world did she get an idea like that??)
Pearl:
By the way... this may be rude, but which channeling school are you from?
Phoenix:
Which channeling school?
Pearl:
Yes. For example, I study the Kurain technique.
Phoenix:
... Ah, I get it! No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. A lawyer.
Pearl:
...Law...yer?
Phoenix:
Yup.
Pearl:

Yeah, it's OK. I was told to give it to you.

But, I can't accept something like this! ...All I really should do is charge this Magatama with spiritual energy...

Please take this. I'm sure it will be helpful.

I've got two pieces of news for you, pal.

Two?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. "Bad news" and "even worse news." So which do you want to hear first?
Phoenix:
...I don't really care... It doesn't change the fact that I'm not going to like it.
Gumshoe:
Alright, pal. Well, the prosecutor for the trial is Prosecutor von Karma.
Phoenix:
WHAT!? Von Karma!?
Phoenix:
(Manfred von Karma... He was an awe-inspiring veteran prosecutor. He never lost a case in the 40 years of his career, and he raised a fearsome disciple. The horrible aftertaste of the evil he force-fed me is something I'll never forget.)
Phoenix:
... Wait a sec. But didn't Von Karma stand trial and...
Gumshoe:
That's where the other piece of bad news comes in... The Von Karma you're facing tomorrow is actually his successor...
Phoenix:
Successor...?
Successor (appears after Tomorrow's trial)
Phoenix:
So, um... Who is this "successor" to Von Karma?
Gumshoe:
Literally, pal, it's Prosecutor von Karma's kid. His kid became a prosecutor real young... like 13, and hasn't lost a trial since. That's what they call a "prodigy," pal.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Kid, huh... ... W-W-Wait a sec! Th-Th-Thirteen!? The kid became a prosecutor at the age of THIRTEEN!? I mean, a prodigy like that... I would have heard something about...
Gumshoe:
Oh, no, no. The kid was born and raised in Germany, pal. That country's got a lot of stuff and is a great place to develop a person's talents.
Phoenix:
(Germany, huh? That's probably why I've never heard of this person. Ugh... Still, all it takes is someone mentioning the name "Von Karma", and I get terrible flashbacks to that case. Stop it! Get over it, Phoenix! That person is already gone...)

Only that Ms. Fey was looking for her earlier. Something about being worried that she'll end up talking to the weird guy. So, you have any idea who this "weird guy" is, pal?
Phoenix:
...Nope. Not a clue.
Morgan Fey profile
Gumshoe:
That's Maya's aunt, right? I got to eat one of her giant strawberry desserts earlier. It was really good!
Phoenix:
(Aw, I didn't get to eat one yet...)
Dick Gumshoe profile
Gumshoe:
Boy do I look scary in this picture. I guess if I want people to stop thinking cops are scary, I have to change myself. Gotta smile, gotta smile!
Phoenix:
(There's that classic Gumshoe goofy smile again...)
Any other evidence
Gumshoe:
Ooh, I'd better shut my mouth.
Phoenix:
Uh, what?
Gumshoe:
I'm not gonna give you any information about evidence, pal.
Phoenix:
Oh.
Any other profile
Gumshoe:
I don't have anything to tell you about this one, pal.
Phoenix:
You don't have to be so mean about it.
Gumshoe:
Not. A. Word.
Pearl:
...
Gumshoe:
H-H-Hey! Don't look at me like that!
Phoenix:
(That girl has one intense stare... *gulp*)
June 20Fey ManorSide Room
Phoenix:
Hello again. We seem to be seeing a lot of each other today.
Ini:
Aww, she's, like, tooootally cute! Is she, like, your daughter?
Phoenix:
W-What!? NO! (How old do you think I am!?)
Talk
The victim
Phoenix:
I want to ask you about the victim, Dr. Grey.
Ini:
I, like, totally don't know him.
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
Phoenix:
Aaack! What is that!?
Ini:
...?
Pearl:
You can see it, can't you, Mr. Nick? You can see the "lock" on that person's heart.
Phoenix:
Huh, what...?
Pearl:
This is the power of the Magatama. Only you can see these "Psyche-Locks", Mr. Nick.
Phoenix:
(Psyche-Locks, huh...)
Pearl:
The more someone wants to hide their secret, the more locks you will see. If it's only one, I think you can easily unlock it.
Phoenix:
"Unlock"...? But how?
Pearl:
Please use Mystic Maya's Magatama on this person, and let's remove the lock.
Phoenix:
(I have no idea what she's talking about, but... Guess I'll give it a try.)
Pearl:
You must be careful, though, Mr. Nick. If you make a mistake, it will hurt you. If you don't think you have the proof you need, you must have the courage to stop.
Phoenix:
(Well, I've got to start somewhere. Let's give this Psyche-Lock thing a try.)
The victim (after Psyche-Lock appear)
Phoenix:
Iim going to ask you again. Did you know Dr. Grey?
Ini:
I totally don't know that guy. Like, you're totally more presistent than a roach!
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
Phoenix:
(This girl is hiding something! I'm sure of it! I guess I have no choice but to remove this lock. Alright, so first, I have to use Maya's Magatama...)
Present Maya's Magatama
Phoenix:
Take that!
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
-- The Victim --
Phoenix:
Ini Miney. I believe you do know who Dr. Grey is!
Ini:
I told you! Like, how many times do I, like, have to repeat myself? If you're, like, so totally sure, then where's, like, your proof?
Phoenix:
While it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person, I do believe you might have at least, indirectly known of him.
Ini:
Like, what do you mean, like, "indirectly"...?
Phoenix:
(I should try to show that the possibility existed for now...) (Hmm, so, something that shows a possible connection between Ini and Dr. Grey...)
Present Newspaper Clipping 2
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Take a look at this newspaper clipping."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Here is your proof!
Ini:
Like, what is that...?
Phoenix:
Ouch... I guess it doesn't have anything to do with it, huh? (Pearls did warn me... "If you make a mistake, it will hurt you," she said. If I don't have enough evidence, I should probably "stop". I should take another look at the Court Record and think it through one more time.)
Leads back to:
"While it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person,"
Phoenix:
Take a look at this newspaper clipping.
Ini:
Like, what is it? ... A story about an accident?
Phoenix:
Please read the victim's name.
Ini:
Um..."Mimi Miney"...
Phoenix:
"Miney" is a pretty rare last name, wouldn't you say? Ms. Mimi Miney wouldn't happen to be a relative of yours, would she?
Ini:
...! So you noticed. Sh-She was my older sister.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry about your loss... Your sister... Was she a nurse... Perhaps at Dr. Grey's surgical clinic?
Ini:
...!
Phoenix:
Grey Surgical Clinic... I don't think I need to tell you that the clinic was run by the victim, Dr. Turner Grey. Which is how you knew of Dr. Grey; you knew him through your sister!

Talk (after breaking Psyche-Lock)
The victim
Phoenix:
Please, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey.
Ini:
My... My sister's name was Mimi Miney. She was, like, a nurse at Dr. Grey's clinic.
Phoenix:
(That's what I thought...)
Ini:
I heard that, like, Dr. Grey was really tough on people. Like, a total slave driver. My sis was, like, always coming home totally wiped out 'cause she was overworked.
Phoenix:
Wiped out? So is that why she fell asleep at the wheel?
Ini:
That guy, like, drove my sis so hard, so, like, that's why the accident happened.
Phoenix:
The one where 14 patients died from malpractice?
Ini:
Yeah, like, I think that was the doctor's fault, too. My sis was pushed by, like, everyone's expectations and, like, her duties and stuff. And that pushed her to her death.
Phoenix:
Oh... I'm sorry...
Ini:
So, like, are we done? I've, like, already told my story to, like, everyone...
(Clearing "The victim" "Talk" option leads to:)
Pearl:
Do you understand now, Mr. Nick? This is how a Psyche-Lock works.
Phoenix:
...Well, I don't plan to pry into people's hearts unless I absolutely need to...
Pearl:
The lock this time was pretty easy, but... you might meet people who aren't as willing to give in later on. If you don't have enough proof, be careful and know when to stop trying.

Phoenix:
Hmm? What's wrong?
Pearl:
I have never left Kurain Village.
Phoenix:
R-Really? Wow, that's, um, pretty amazing...
Pearl:
You are going to meet with Mystic Maya... aren't you? Please tell her I said hi.
Phoenix:
Hey, wait! (She ran off... Again. Well, I know Ini's secret now, but... I still don't have any idea how I'm going to save Maya. I don't even know if I should go in there with a smile or a straight face... *sigh*)

Phoenix:
(What am I supposed to do!? I'm almost out of time! Can I really do anything? Can I really save her...?)
???:
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Phoenix:
(Huh? Must be Maya...)
???:
It's been a long time, hasn't it, Phoenix?
Phoenix:
...! (That voice...) M-Mia!
Mia:
Even without me being here, it looks like you've learned to stand on your own.
Phoenix:
(Mia... She's Maya's older sister, and my mentor. She was a top-notch defense lawyer, but a certain case forced her into "retirement". But... whenever I'm in trouble, she comes to help, just like this. Her spirit comes back from the other world and borrows Maya's body for a bit...)
Mia:
Phoenix, you can't make that kind of face in front of your client.
Phoenix:
...!
Mia:
A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets, and especially when it's bad.
Phoenix:
Mia...
Mia:
You can't smile at the end if you haven't been smiling the whole way there. In any case, the face you're making now is no face to show a client, Phoenix.
Phoenix:
B-But!
Mia:
So, tell me all about it. I'm going to guess that my sister is in a lot of trouble again...
Phoenix:
(I told her everything about what had happened in the last two days. Mia closed her eyes, deep in thought, while she listened...)
Mia:
...I see...
Phoenix:
Mia... What am I supposed to do?
Mia:
... It's pretty clear what a good lawyer does in this situation.
Phoenix:
A-And that is!? Tell me, please!
Mia:
Believe in your convictions. And fight for the complete acquittal of your client.
Talk
Not guilty
Phoenix:
You think Maya's not guilty!? How can you be so sure!?
Mia:
I know she is. And I'll give you a hint as to why.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
Mia:
Mediums can't have dreams.
Phoenix:
Can't have "dreams"...?
Mia:
From what you told me, it sounds like Maya was having a dream while channeling.
Phoenix:
Yeah... She said she dream that she had died and had been buried in the ground.
Mia:
But that is impossible. You've heard it from her, I'm sure. When a medium channels, her own spirit disappears. Which means that it's impossible for her to dream during that time.
Phoenix:
...! Then... What does this mean!?
Mia:
I think it's safe to bet that Maya was set-up.
Phoenix:
A set-up!?
Mia:
It's up to you to blow the lid on this case tomorrow and show how she was set-up.
Evidence?
Phoenix:
How am I supposed to prove her innocence when I have nothing to go on!?
Mia:
If you're looking for a clue, it's already in your hands.
Phoenix:
I-It is!?
Mia:
Just as it sounds, Phoenix, you already hold the "key".
Phoenix:
(R-Really...?)
Mia:
Come on, show me the "key" to this case.
Phoenix:
(The "key", huh? Alright, I'll show it to her; the "key" I hold.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Mia...
Mia:
*chuckle* Wow, this badge brings back a lot of memories, doesn't it...? I would love to stand with you at the defense table one more time.
Phoenix:
(Mia...)
Maya's Magatama
Mia:
This is... Maya's Magatama, isn't it? Why do you have it...?
Phoenix:
Maya gave it to me, but...
Mia:
I see... ... This is something very important to me. Take good care of it, OK?
Phoenix:
(She looks at it with such a soft look in her eyes...)
Black Key
Phoenix:
Mia, have you seen this key before?
Mia:
Ahh, the key... It's literally, the key to understanding everything that's happened in this case.
Phoenix:
This key?
Mia:
Phoenix, listen. Right now, that key is sitting in your hand. However, it shouldn't be. ... It contradicts the "facts".
Phoenix:
(What does she mean...?)
Mia:
I'm certain this key will be the piece of evidence that makes your case tomorrow.
Maya Fey profile
Mia:
I can't see Maya... when I'm in her body like this... But I can tell. She's very lonely and sad. Take good care of her, will you, Phoenix?
Phoenix:
I-I will...
Pearl Fey profile
Mia:
Pearly! She's really grown up... I left Kurain Village a long time ago. She probably doesn't remember a thing about me by now...
Morgan Fey profile
Mia:
I'm afraid I might have caused Aunt Morgan a lot of stress. When I left Kurain, I left Maya in my aunt's care. And now something like this happens...
Dick Gumshoe profile
Mia:
I've seen this man somewhere before... He had a strange name... and I'm almost sure I've questioned him before. I remember him making a show of confidence at first, but after five minutes, he breaks down and... ...you end up feeling bad for the poor guy...
Mia Fey profile
Mia:
That's right. I'm already dead. But I feel very grateful to have been born a Fey... so I can talk with you like this...
Any other evidence
Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this?
Mia:
...Do you have anything more useful? There's no time left. Try to show me something that will help you in tomorrow's trial.
Any other profile
Mia:
I'm sorry, but I don't remember who that is...
(Clearing all "Talk" options and presenting Black Key leads to:)
Mia:
... ... You already know everything you need to know. You know what the "key" to this case is... That is enough...
Phoenix:
But... But! How can I win tomorrow without knowing who the real murderer is!? Who... Who could have...?
Mia:
...
Phoenix:
(At the time, I didn't know, but this day was going to end with a turn for the surprising...)
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
M-Mia!? Wh-What...!?
Mia:
What's wrong?
Phoenix:
(That's right. Only I can see the Psyche-Locks... Which means... Mia must know something about the real murderer! But for this to be something that she would hide under lock and key from even me... What in the world is going on!?)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
Exit Magatama session
Phoenix:
(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)
Too many errors during Magatama session
...Mr. Nick......If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter......Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...
Phoenix:
(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)
