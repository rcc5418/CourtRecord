Chapter 4The Golden Court
Waiting Hall
Maya:
It doesn't make sense...*sob* How has it come to this...?
Phoenix:
The darned witch! Why did it have to happen to the professor, of all people?!
Maya:
You've got to believe me, Nick! I may be a spirit medium, but I'm no witch!
Phoenix:
Don't worry, I know it wasn't you!
Maya:
...Hmm? Say, have you seen Luke today?
Phoenix:
I haven't seen him since last night. He was crying all night... I didn't know what to say to him...
Maya:
No kidding... He's the one suffering the most from all this... Poor kid...
Phoenix:
He probably needs some time alone with his grief. We should leave him be.
Maya:
Yeah... He shouldn't have to see this trial. It'd be too hard for him.
Espella:
............
Maya:
Oh, it's Espella!
Phoenix:
What are you doing here, Espella? Have you been cleared of the accusations?
Espella:
No...not yet. If only it was that easy... It's just that... I'm not technically under arrest, so I got special permission to come here. I'm free to go wherever I like...within this building.
Phoenix:
Ah, I see...
Espella:
Uhm... I... I heard about Mr Layton. It's awful... He was such a good man!
Phoenix:
............ I'm sorry, Espella.
Espella:
Huh? What are you apologising for?
Phoenix:
We were supposed to find clues connected to Bezella... but we couldn't find anything. And now the professor's been...
Espella:
No, don't say that! It's not your fault! And I don't believe a word of what they say about Maya! She isn't a witch!
Maya:
Thank you, Espella...
Espella:
Uhm...Mr Wright... Do you mind if I assist you in court today?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Espella:
I...I know I may not be of much use... but I'll do what I can! I want to help you and Maya!
Phoenix:
Espella...
???:
...Excuse me.
Phoenix:
Y-you're...
Greyerl:
Greyerl, butler of the late Master Belduke. I have come to enquire after Miss Maya. It is most regrettable what happened yesterday.
Maya:
Oh, thank you for coming all the way here! ...Hmm? You look really pale, Jean. Are you all right?
Greyerl:
Oh, please don't worry about me. It's merely that, since the incident, sleep has eluded me.
Maya:
Oh...
Greyerl:
I spent the night searching through Master's notes on alchemy. I hoped there may be some mention... of a method by which something turned to gold may be reverted back to its original form.
Phoenix:
You were looking for a way to... rescue the professor?
Greyerl:
Human fate is often cruel. But that's also why we must never lose hope.
Maya:
Jean...
Defender! Accused! The trial is about to start. Proceed to the chamber!
Phoenix:
Y-yes, we're coming!
Maya:
Nick...
Phoenix:
Cheer up, Maya! I'm not just going to let them sentence you!
Maya:
I just wish all this would stop already. Whether someone's a "witch" or not... no one deserves to be burned!
Phoenix:
I know. I can't stand for it either.
Greyerl:
............ If you'll kindly excuse me now, I must return to my duties.
Phoenix:
Ah, no problem. We, uhm, appreciate you coming to see us. (Something's bothering me... Jean seems somewhat odd today.)
Espella:
...Let's go, Mr Wright! The trial is about to begin!
Witches' Court
Judge:
Ahem... The trial of Maya Fey shall now begin, as scheduled. Knights of the Court, are you ready to cross your swords of justice?
Barnham:
Inquisitor Zacharias Barnham always has his sword ready for the work of justice.
Phoenix:
Uhh...defence ready, Your Honour. At this stage, I've just gotta give it all I've got!
Judge:
............ It would appear the defender has thrown down the gauntlet, Sir Barnham. Now, before we begin...may I have a word with you, defender?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honour!
Judge:
Last time me met, you stood in this court as an apprentice baker. In all honesty, when I saw you for the first time, I thought to myself: "A baker should stick to bread baking."
Phoenix:
...Is that so? (What a fine first impression I made...)
Judge:
However, today you are not merely some befuddled maker of sweet buns. I am obliged to fully recognise you... as a knight of law and justice on par with Inquisitor Zacharias Barnham.
Barnham:
............
Judge:
Now, may your duel begin! Fight bravely and expose the truth behind this heinous crime!
All right! We're all counting on you, Inquisitor Barnham!I knew she was a witch as soon as I laid my eyes on her! She's got "witch" written all over her!Why not put the baker on trial?! Bake the baker, I say!Barnham! Barnham! Barnham! Barnham!
Phoenix:
(They treat him like some sort of celebrity...)
Espella:
He may be adored by the crowds, but when he pointed his sword my way, you managed to shield me from his accusations! Maya clearly isn't a witch! So surely your victory is certain!
Phoenix:
Thank you for believing in me, Espella.
Barnham:
Espella Cantabella...
Espella:
......!
Barnham:
I have given you leave to come to this trial today. However, that does not mean... that the charges against you have been dropped. Rather than worry about others, you should consider your own situation!
Espella:
............ Thank you for granting me your permission, Inquisitor.
Judge:
Inquisitor Barnham, you may begin your opening statement.
Barnham:
As you wish, Milord. As usual, let us commence this trial by first recounting the events. If it pleases you, Sir Blue Knight...
Phoenix:
As, uhm, you wish...Inquisitor. (I still can't get used to this terminology...)
Barnham:
This heinous crime occurred in the residence of the late Newton Belduke, the alchemist. Here is the sketched plan of his residence. This room, of a somewhat questionable nature, is the alchemist's study, in which the incident took place. The only ones present at the moment of the crime were the accused and the victim. No one else. The witnesses, who arrived at the scene seconds later, have indicated where they found the accused and the victim.
Judge:
Very well. The sketch is accepted as evidence.
Floor Plan added to the Court Record.
Barnham:
The accused took Sir Layton's life with the most cruel of magic. A living man one second, a golden statue the next! Such wickedness!
Phoenix:
(Magic that turns things into gold? ...Sure, why not?)
Barnham:
Several townspeople rushed to the room and paid witness to the horror of this magic. The accused has been captured and charged.
Judge:
Goodness, that is terrifying! Rumours have reached me that the victim was a most scintillating man. I'm not quite certain whether it was prior to or after... But incidentally...was this Sir Layton not the same hat maker who attended our previous trial?
Phoenix:
No, no, he wasn't a hat ma-
Barnham:
Bizarre as it is... Sir Layton's profession and origin remain unknown. He was a stranger in this city... that is all we know.
Phoenix:
...!
Barnham:
And you, sir, his acquaintance... You are an unusual presence in our city yourself.
Phoenix:
............
Judge:
Hmph. Today's case certainly is peculiar.
Barnham:
And that is not the last of the peculiarities, Milord. The alchemist's study has been the scene of another strange incident in the past...
Judge:
Ah yes, I remember it as if it were yesterday. The mysterious death of Newton Belduke himself.
Barnham:
Indeed, Milord. Regrettably, the only case of witchcraft still to remain unsolved in our fair city. The witch may have escaped her punishment back then... but perhaps today is the day on which both these mysterious crimes shall be solved.
Phoenix:
What? Wh-what are you implying?!
Barnham:
Patience! You will know soon enough, Sir Suddenly-Pale Blue Knight.
Judge:
How interesting. It seems that the inquisition have something up their sleeve. Now, Inquisitor Barnham, you may begin.
Barnham:
Thank you, Milord. The inquisition summons the witnesses to this malicious crime of witchcraft!
Phoenix:
(If only... If only I'd made it to the room sooner... Maybe I could've prevented all this from happening... I won't let Maya take the rap for this! I'll find every single crack in their testimony and prove it wasn't her!)
Judge:
Welcome to the Witches' Court, honourable witnesses. Now, let us hear your names and occupations.
Emeer:
I am known far and wide as Emeer Punchenbaug I, soon to be the new head of Punchenbaug's Retail Organisation, "PRO".
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
W-wait a minute, witness!
Emeer:
What's that, blue squire?
Phoenix:
You're...that guy from the previous trial! Just...what the heck's happened to you? You look like you've been on one of those "ultimate makeover" shows...
Emeer:
............ Whatever do you mean? Me name is Emeer Punchenbaug I, soon to be the head of Punchenbaug's Retail Organisation, "PRO".
Phoenix:
Wh-what is the meaning of this, Inquisitor?
Barnham:
I do not care to delve into this witness' [sic] personal affairs.
Phoenix:
(Looks like he remembers him all too well...)
Judge:
Witnesses, pray continue.
Ms Primstone:
Oh dearie, dearie me. It is I who usually asks the questions... I am, you see, but a humble teacher. Call me Ms Primstone. The children of Labyrinthia Primary School have the privilege of learning the truths about this world from me.
Phoenix:
(An elementary school teacher, huh... Good to know at least one witness seems sensible.)
Birdly:
♪The winds carry my song, it's Birdly Stringing along! Parrot and bard, ensemble avant-garde!♪
My faithful muse, here, is Cracker the musical parrot. No one understands music like Cracker. Aside from me, naturally.
Cracker:
Oh dearie, dearie me!
Phoenix:
(At least it's not another goat...)
Espella:
What a smart bird! He just imitated that teacher perfectly!
Luke:
I'm Luke Triton. My occupation is... the professor's apprentice!
Phoenix:
Luke?
Luke! But...why?!
Luke:
............
Phoenix:
What are you doing there?
Luke:
...I made up my mind. I'm doing this for the professor! A gentleman has to pursue the truth!
Phoenix:
But...Luke. That's where the inquisition's witnesses stand!
Luke:
I...I'll never... I'll never forgive that witch!
Phoenix:
(A gentleman shouldn't glare at people as if he wants to hit them in the face...)
Maya:
L-Luke...
Barnham:
"Your friend today can be your enemy tomorrow." Such is the hard reality of the battlefield.
Judge:
Witnesses, we will now hear your testimonies. Tell us all of this wicked incident, which you have been unfortunate enough to witness.
Witness Testimony
- What We Witnessed -
Emeer:
I heard a scream and an incantation, and then when I entered the room, the victim was already all shiny!
Ms Primstone:
Mayhap something caused discord between erstwhile friends? Mr Silk Hat had a knife at the ready, in his hand!
Birdly:
♪Victim of magic, sparkly and done for, I heard the staff fall on the floor♪
Luke:
The professor must have seen through Miss Maya's deception and confronted her right there, face-to-face!
Judge:
I see... Thank you all... However, one part of the testimony was somewhat confusing... You there...the singer...
Birdly:
Singer? Could you possibly mean me, Birdly the bard, Your Excellence?
Judge:
Yes, that would be you, singer. This "staff" that you said...sung about...
Barnham:
It is as you suspect, Milord. This very witch's sceptre.
Phoenix:
...!
Espella:
There are two different magic gems attached, meaning the perpetrator could have used two types of magic.
Phoenix:
Yeah...it would seem so.
Barnham:
This gem here enables the use of a gold transmutation spell, "Goldor".
Judge:
"Goldor"... Just the word alone makes the tiny hairs on the back of my neck stand up.
Emeer:
Har har har, that's the one, all right! That's the dreadful incantation that I, Emeer Punchenbaug I, also heard!
Ms Primstone:
Oh dearie, dearie me! I have seen that sceptre, so I have!
Birdly:
♪Clank! Tips over the golden man! The sceptre falls. Not the witch's plan!♪
Cracker:
Oh dearie, dearie me!
Luke:
How dare she do that to the professor!
Barnham:
By the way, this witch's sceptre was found on the floor, near the victim. If you'll turn your attention to the sketched plans, it was located right here. A sceptre dropped by the accused would naturally tumble to exactly that spot.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Inquisitor Barnham! What you're saying amounts to nothing more than a baseless assumption!
Barnham:
You are on edge today, Sir Blue Knight. Is it because your friend is on trial? Perhaps you had better cool yourself down.
Judge:
...Well, anyway. The court accepts the sceptre as evidence.
Barnham:
Thank you, Milord.
Talea Magica added to the Court Record.
The spell Goldor has been bookmarked in the Grand Grimoire.
Phoenix:
Um, Inquisitor Barnham, may I ask you something?
Barnham:
What is it now, Sir Blue Knight?
Phoenix:
We know that one of the gems is for the spell Goldor, but what about the other one?
Barnham:
A naive question...
Phoenix:
Huh?
Barnham:
Naivety may be no hindrance to a baker, who spends most of his time amidst bread. But it can be your undoing here in court. Would a knight put a weapon in his enemy's hand?
Phoenix:
(He's telling me to do my homework, huh.)
Espella:
Mr Wright! I'll look for information about that magic gem in the Grand Grimoire!
Phoenix:
Thank you, Espella. That would be great.
Espella:
Just leave it to me!
Phoenix:
(She seems very happy to help.)
Judge:
The defender may interrogate the witnesses.
Cross Examination
- What We Witnessed -
Emeer:
I heard a scream and an incantation, and then when I entered the room, the victim was already all shiny!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
And, um...what is all this about...exactly?
Emeer:
Whaddya mean, blue squire?
Phoenix:
Your gaudy...uhm...colourful outfit! I mean, your attire was different last time. A little more...modest.
Emeer:
The Emeer you knew back then is no more! I am a new man now, reborn into the higher echelons of society. *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp*
Phoenix:
(What's he drinking? There's a skull and crossbones mark on that bottle...)
Barnham:
Enough idle chatter. The witness heard a scream and an incantation, is that correct?
Emeer:
That's right! It's just like what you said earlier, Inquisitor Barnham! It was the spell "Goldor". And it was, without doubt, the voice of the accused that said it!
Judge:
Hmm, however...it's rather peculiar. When I saw the accused and the victim together last time... they seemed to be on friendly terms.
Barnham:
The next witness will dispel your doubts, Milord.
Ms Primstone:
Mayhap something caused discord between erstwhile friends? Mr Silk Hat had a knife at the ready, in his hand!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Are you saying you think they quarrelled?
Ms Primstone:
The other day I saw you all together in this very court, and you were evidently friends.
Phoenix:
Well, yeah...that's true, but what's that got to do wi-
Ms Primstone:
Now, everyone! Listen carefully! No chatting in the back row! What I say now will be in the next exam! Ms Primstone's lesson number five! "Friendship leads to nothing but trouble." People would not break up and part their ways in anger if they did not become friends in the first place!
Phoenix:
(The kids in her class must grow up to be "model citizens"...)
Ms Primstone:
Oh dearie, dearie me! What I saw in that room curdled the blood in my veins! Mr Silk Hat was pointing that glittering knife ever so threateningly!
Question Luke Triton
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Is everything okay, Luke?
Luke:
No, of course it's not okay! The professor was a true gentleman... And no gentleman would go around threatening people with knives!
Phoenix:
(I couldn't agree more...)
Ms Primstone:
Silly boy! I saw your professor pointing a knife. Are you insinuating that I am a liar, you cheeky little whippersnapper?
Luke:
The professor would never do that! You don't know him!
Phoenix:
(At least Luke's found someone else to antagonise...)
Espella:
Uhm, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Hm? What is it?
Espella:
I think there was some important information in Ms Primstone's testimony...
Phoenix:
Really?
Espella:
Oh, I'm sorry! It's not my place to say things like that...
Phoenix:
(Hmm, I didn't notice anything. What could that be? What was Espella about to say?)
Ask Espella to speak out
Phoenix:
Espella, why don't you tell us all what you've noticed?
Espella:
Oh, is that okay? It's just something I'd like to ask Ms Primstone about...
Phoenix:
Well, just go ahead and ask her.
Espella:
Uhm, excuse me, Ms Primstone? Do you mind if I ask you a question?
Ms Primstone:
Oh! It's you! Miss...Espella Cantabella!
Espella:
Ms Primstone, did you actually see the knife that Mr Layton was holding?
Ms Primstone:
I...I did, as a matter of fact, yes! I remember that glinting blade very well. A most frightening sight it was, too...
Espella:
And you saw that from the door, didn't you? Now if we look at the sketch... When the incident took place, Mr Layton must have been facing this way, correct?
Barnham:
That must have been the case. Otherwise the witness would not have been able to see it.
Espella:
Uhm, well, that's all I wanted to ask. The more information we have the better, right?
Phoenix:
(The direction the professor was facing... That could be important.)
Judge:
This information shall be added to the Court Record.
Floor Plan updated in the Court Record.
Espella:
I'm sorry I jumped in like that, but I really wanted to help...
Phoenix:
Not at all, Espella! We were able to get some more info, which may just come in handy.
Espella:
You...think so?
Judge:
Now then, the next witness shall continue with the testimony!
Leads back to cross-examination
Leave it for later
Phoenix:
(It won't do any good to make Espella the centre of attention now.) Sorry, Espella. Can I get back to you about this a bit later?
Espella:
Yes, of course! No need to apologise.
Phoenix:
(She looks a bit disappointed. I'll have to remember to get back to that later...)
Judge:
Now then, the next witness shall continue with the testimony!
Leads back to cross-examination
Phoenix:
The professor threatened Maya with a knife? (That sounds hard to believe!)
Ms Primstone:
Perhaps he discovered that she was a witch, or she tried to attack him first. Ms Primstone's lesson number seven! "Secrets lead to nothing but trouble." From the smallest of secrets can sprout the largest of arguments! This one is going to be in the exam!
Phoenix:
(Everything's the beginning of trouble to her...)
Espella:
Uhm, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Hm? What is it?

I think there was some important information in Ms Primstone's testimony...

Birdly:
♪Victim of magic, sparkly and done for, I heard the staff fall on the floor♪
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Uhm, would you mind describing what you saw without singing about it?
Birdly:
...As you wish, my musically impaired friend. Simply put, when I entered the room, the victim was worth his weight in gold... for obvious reasons. He tipped over and fell heavily on to the floor. The room became drearily silent. And then, I heard that sceptre tumbling across the floor.
Question Primstone
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
May I ask you something, Ms Primstone?
Ms Primstone:
Dearie, dearie me! Oh dearie, dearie me! My dear, do not frighten me so! I feel like a schoolgirl caught napping during class...
Phoenix:
Ms Primstone, did you see the witch's sceptre at the crime scene?
Ms Primstone:
Well, about that... I must confess, I do not clearly recall.
Phoenix:
You don't remember...?
Ms Primstone:
When I went into the room, the golden man fell down and made quite the ruckus. That is why I did not notice a sceptre being dropped.
Phoenix:
So you didn't see it, after all...
Ms Primstone:
But I am certain that witch girl had it. She must have been hiding it behind her back.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Please don't assume Maya is a witch just because she's been accused! (Ms Primstone is certainly quick to make assumptions...)
Barnham:
............
Judge:
I see. Now, we would like to hear the next witness' [sic] testimony.
Phoenix:
(This next witness is a bit problematic...)
Leads back to cross-examination
Phoenix:
(...Couldn't he have just said it like that the first time around?)
Barnham:
Clearly the witch must have dropped the sceptre, then.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That's merely your assumption! Now, Mr Birdly... Did you actually see Maya drop a sceptre? Or did you just hear something tumbling on the floor?
Birdly:
............ I must confess, my eyes were rather more drawn towards the brilliantly glistening golden statue. I did not witness the witch dropping the sceptre, no. But I did hear it...and my sense of hearing is peerless!
Barnham:
Hmph.
Judge:
I see. Now, we would like to hear the next witness' [sic] testimony.
Phoenix:
(This next witness is a bit problematic...)
Luke:
The professor must have seen through Miss Maya's deception and confronted her right there, face-to-face!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Luke, open your eyes! Maya isn't a witch!
Luke:
............ Ever since we came to this town...lots of unbelievable things have happened. And that's why... from now on, I'll only believe what I see with my own eyes!
Maya:
Luke...
Luke:
When I went into that room, the only people I saw were the professor and Maya. The professor had been turned to gold... and Maya dropped that sceptre!
Maya:
That's not true!
Luke:
...What?
Phoenix:
M-Maya...
Maya:
I didn't have any "sceptre"! And we weren't the only ones in tha-
Barnham:
Silence! The accused has no right to speak! Be silent or you will face punishment! We can end this trial immediately, should you decide you feel talkative again.
Maya:
...! I...I'm sorry.
Phoenix:
Well, Luke? Is that really the truth?
Luke:
Huh? Uhm...
Phoenix:
Did you really see the sceptre?
Luke:
............ ............ I...I don't know. When the professor turned to gold and collapsed right in front of me, everything seemed to fade to black... And then...I could've sworn I at least heard Maya drop the sceptre.
Barnham:
The sceptre was found at the scene of the crime. That is the unavoidable truth. Only the accused could have dropped it!
Judge:
Hmm... Mhm...
Present Floor Plan (after Floor Plan is updated in the Court Record)
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Luke, you said that you will only believe what you see with your own eyes."
Phoenix:
(This isn't looking good...)
Espella:
I feel so sorry for Luke.
Phoenix:
He's so full of anger and despair that he can't think clearly.
Espella:
............ He said he can't forgive the "witch". I understand how he feels...
Phoenix:
(Anyway... I need to find a way to calm Luke down first of all...)
Phoenix:
Luke, you said that you will only believe what you see with your own eyes. But what you think you saw may not be the whole truth.
Luke:
Huh? What do you mean?
Phoenix:
Take a close look at the sketch of the crime scene... At the time of the incident, Professor Layton and Maya were standing here. Now, we have learned from Ms Primstone's testimony which way the professor was facing. He was facing this way.
Luke:
Oh...
Phoenix:
You have testified that the professor confronted Maya face-to-face. But looking at the sketch of where they were standing, one thing is clear... There is a contradiction in your testimony!
Luke:
Uwaah?!
Barnham:
Barnham:
Whether they were facing each other or not is of no relevance whatsoever! They were the only ones in that room. One was a victim, thus the other must be the witch!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I will ask you to wait before jumping to conclusions, Inquisitor. Think back to Ms Primstone's testimony... She told us that the professor was pointing a knife at someone, threateningly.
Barnham:
...!
Phoenix:
However, you can see in the sketch that he wasn't threatening Maya. So then, who was he pointing the knife at?
Luke:
Phoenix:
Luke...what is it?
Luke:
The professor would never point a knife at anyone! I was the one who opened the door to that room, so I was the first witness...and I saw no knife! Miss Primstone's testimony is not reliable!
Ms Primstone:
Oh, dearie me! Will you look at this child, sputtering nonsense and talking badly of his elders!
Judge:
Inquisitor Barnham?
Barnham:
Yes, Milord?
Judge:
It should pose no difficulty to verify whether or not the victim had a knife. After all, that...sparkling golden body of his has been found at the scene of the crime, has it not?
Barnham:
............ Indeed it has, Milord. Court attendants! You heard the judge! Bring the victim into the courtroom!
Phoenix:
(Seems like they're going to bring the golden statue...*gulp*)
Luke:
P-Professor...
Judge:
Look at that...
Phoenix:
Uhh, did it get damaged in transit?
Luke:
Professor... PROFESSOR!
Judge:
So this is the power of the gold transmutation spell. Most spectacular... It looks like the work of the finest artisans!
Barnham:
I assure you it is the work of no artisans, Milord. By the way, the missing arm has not yet been found.
Luke:
I...I can't believe this! Professor...
Judge:
I suppose we should add the victim to the evidence.
Phoenix:
(The poor professor who, while searching for evidence, became evidence...)
Golden Layton added to the Court Record.
Judge:
This is unfortunate... I thought the evidence would be as good as gold... but although it technically is, we are still no closer to discerning whether or not the victim was holding a knife.
Maya:
Maya:
Let me speak, please!
Phoenix:
Maya...
Maya:
The professor didn't have a knife! And also... There was another person in that room! The real witch was there too! Please believe me!
Barnham:
Accused, do I really need to warn you again? Inside the cage, you are to behave like a bird that has forgotten its song. Speak again and you shall be punished. Or are you in a particular hurry to taste the flames of justice, little bird?
Maya:
*sob*
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But...it's true that someone else could have been at the crime scene! Look at the sketch! The victim was facing towards someone, and that person wasn't Maya!
Barnham:
Sir Blue Knight, your ignorance is no longer even a surprise.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Barnham:
You do not know what transpired at the crime scene. You think this man was pointing at another person, you say? Let me tell you this. Nearly everyone in this court other than you knows what Sir Hat was pointing at.
Luke:
Wh-what?
Barnham:
Well, honourable witnesses? Is that not so?
Emeer:
I, Emeer Punchenbaug I, love me some gossip and stories of the occult!
Birdly:
♪Elusive like mist, the magical beast! Its chilling breath brings about death♪
Ms Primstone:
Oh dearie, dearie me! You could use some education, Blue Knight. I can offer you private tuition, but it will not come cheap!
Luke:
If the professor wasn't confronting Maya...
Judge:
Witnesses, you will now testify. Tell us all about this other presence at the crime scene.
Witness Testimony
- A Shadow at the Crime Scene -
Emeer:
We all know what happened to that alchemist, so this case's no mystery.
Ms Primstone:
Same place, same magic trick. This time, her luck ran out and she dropped that magic sceptre.
Birdly:
♪The truth obscured by a twisted ruse, The witch couldn't vanish but did confuse♪
Luke:
It happened because the professor unravelled the mystery behind all these witches...
Phoenix:
The "same magic trick" was used?
Barnham:
They are referring to an incident from three months ago. Much like this incident, a man lost his life to witchcraft in that very room.
Judge:
It was the master of that residence, Sir Newton Belduke, the alchemist.
Barnham:
He suffered death by strangulation... Finger marks were left on his neck. He had locked himself in his study, and the key was still in his pocket.
Judge:
In other words, no one could have entered that room.
Phoenix:
(The perpetrator disappeared from a locked room...just like in this case.)
Barnham:
A large amount of powdered medicine was spilt all over the floor.
Phoenix:
Powdered medicine?
Judge:
Sir Belduke was an alchemist. He possessed various medicinal concoctions.
Barnham:
Due to the presence of that powder, had anyone entered that room, clear footprints would have remained. Yet there were none.
Luke:
That's the kind of mystery that the professor would have loved to solve...
Judge:
Thus there were two unnatural circumstances to Sir Belduke's death. The culprit's disappearance from a locked room... and the fact that they appeared not to have walked on the floor. It's almost as if they flew away.
Espella:
In other words, it couldn't have been the "Dimere" magic that was used in my case the other day...
Phoenix:
(Seems like the killer levitated above the floor, strangled Belduke and vanished into thin air...) But what does that have to do with this trial?
Barnham:
It has been three months since that murder. Despite that, we still haven't been able to find the witch responsible. But now, having eluded us for so long... that witch has finally been brought before this court! We will have justice.
Phoenix:
Wh-whaaat?! (No way... Now he thinks Maya killed the alchemist, too. We weren't even here back then... But it's not like I can explain that to him.)
Barnham:
Well then, why don't you interrogate the witnesses? ...Now that you are aware of the connection between the two murders.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! Three months ago, we weren't even...
Judge:
Defender, you may interrogate the witnesses. May their testimonies lead us to the truth!
Cross Examination

Emeer:
We all know what happened to that alchemist, so this case's no mystery.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You're talking about Mr Belduke's murder, which took place in a locked room?
Emeer:
Yeah. A real shocker, all right. Everyone was talkin' about it. People don't say this out loud, but y'know, eh? You're thinking it too, eh?
Phoenix:
I don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about...
Emeer:
Ain't it clear as day?! He was an alchemist. An alchemist! Alchemy's just like magic, ain't it?
Judge:
Sir Belduke was a man. Only a woman can be a witch... What's more, witchcraft has nothing to do with alchemy. They're...different. Somehow.
Barnham:
Alchemy is the mysterious art of manipulating the forces of nature. ...Or so it is said.
Emeer:
Well that sounds a lot like magic to me! Alchemy's incomp...incomprehensi...sible to regular people! S'all magic really! And y'know, a coupl'a days before the witch got 'im, there was that lightnin' that struck...
Phoenix:
...Lightning?
Emeer:
Glad yer askin', because I like tellin' that one! All of a sudden, like a bolt from the blue sky, there was this bolt from the sky...only it wasn't blue! The sky lit up an' turned blood red. And then, out of nowhere, an old-lookin' bell tower appeared in a burst of flames! Makes ya realise Mother Nature's pretty powerful stuff, eh? *gulp* *gulp* *gulp*
Barnham:
You have strayed off the topic at hand, witness. This is a courthouse, not an inn. Save your...thrilling stories for later.
Ms Primstone:
Same place, same magic trick. This time, her luck ran out and she dropped that magic sceptre.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Would you care to elaborate on that, Ms Primstone?
Ms Primstone:
You could say I am a scholar, and my knowledge is vast and diverse. I know a thing or two about witchcraft. Therefore, I have a very good idea of the type of magic that must have been used this time.
Phoenix:
The magic behind this mysterious figure that appeared out of nowhere, glided through the air and vanished after making the kill?
Ms Primstone:
Indeed, yes. And the witch's sceptre confirms my theory.
Barnham:
A brilliant deduction. I am honoured to have studied under an excellent teacher such as yourself, Ms Primstone.
Phoenix:
(She was his teacher? Actually, I guess that kind of explains a lot...)
Barnham:
Our Occult Crime Analysts have arrived at the same conclusion.
Espella:
Mr Wright! I found it! The page about the purple magic gem! The spell's called Famalia.
Phoenix:
"Famalia"? What does it do?
Barnham:
The spell Famalia, bound within this purple gem, is used to summon a familiar.
Judge:
Familiars appear out of nowhere, glide through the air and vanish when their task is accomplished... They are evil, bloodthirsty spirits used by witches to perform outrageous crimes.
Phoenix:
Evil spirits? Are you saying that the witch used a familiar to...
Barnham:
It was a familiar that took Sir Belduke's life. And now it has appeared again. Sir Silk Hat was probably trying to ward off the evil spirit with his knife. But what good is a knife against an occult creature? It completed the task given to it by the witch and promptly vanished. Thus bringing us to the conclusion that... Sir Belduke and Sir Silk Hat were both killed by the same witch!
Phoenix:
Whaaa-whaaaaat?!
Judge:
What an...unexpected turn of events. The two incidents have been shown to be connected... due to the same witch's sceptre having been used in both cases!
Talea Magica updated in the Court Record.
The spell Famalia has been bookmarked in the Grand Grimoire.
Espella:
Oh, this is terrible! Now Maya is accused of two murders...
Ms Primstone:
Oh dearie, dearie me! I was right, as always. This gruesome murder will be in the next exam. Make sure to take notes! Now, I shall divulge what really happened.
Barnham:
We are all ears, Ms Primstone.
Changes statement from "Same place, same magic trick. This time, her luck ran out and she dropped that magic sceptre." to "That hat maker was pointing the knife at the witch's familiar."
Ms Primstone:
That hat maker was pointing the knife at the witch's familiar.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Did you actually see the familiar?
Ms Primstone:
Oh dearie, dearie me! No, I did not. When that boy opened the door... the familiar had just disappeared. Had the boy opened the door sooner, no doubt we all would have seen it. If he were my student, I would have made sure to teach him not to dilly-dally!
Question Luke Triton
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Is everything all right, Luke? You seem to be in deep thought about something.
Luke:
No, it's not right at all!
Phoenix:
Is there something in Ms Primstone's testimony that you'd like to comment on?
Luke:
That's what I keep telling you! The professor wouldn't point a knife at anyone!
Ms Primstone:
Dearie, dearie me. What an impertinent child! I'm telling you, I saw a knife. I distinctly saw the glint of a sharp blade!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
At any rate, as we can see now... The victim's arm is missing. As such, there is no proof that he had a knife.
Barnham:
Barnham:
That is but a mere detail. It matters not.
Luke:
"A mere detail"?! "Matters not"?!
Judge:
Oh, my... Anyhow, I wonder... where could that missing arm be?
Luke:
Y-yeah! That ought to be looked into!
Question Emeer Punchenbaug
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Leads to:
"Mister, do you have something you'd like to share with us?"
Phoenix:
Hmm, that's right. The arm... Wasn't it found at the crime scene?
Luke:
I swear, I never saw it there!
Birdly:
♪Oh golden arm, where can you be? Reveal yourself, listen to my plea!♪
Ms Primstone:
Oh dearie, dearie me! I'm afraid even I did not notice it!
Barnham:
It is indeed astonishing that the arm could have disappeared from the crime scene.
Luke:
The professor will need his arm when he returns to normal! It's an all-out robbery! Go and investigate it!
Barnham:
The boy's request is not unreasonable. I will order our Occult Crime Analysts to search for it.
Phoenix:
(How could the arm just up and vanish from the crime scene? That just might be the clue I need to give me the upper hand over Barnham...)
Judge:
The court considers the whereabouts of the arm irrelevant to this trial. Mr Wright, make sure that you limit your interrogation to relevant matters.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honour.
Judge:
Now, continue with the interrogation.
Leads back to cross-examination
Phoenix:
(She's talking about Luke, huh...) And when you entered the room, you saw the victim pointing at something?
Ms Primstone:
Pointing a knife, no less. A knife! As I told you before, it was a sharp, glittering knife. The poor man thought a knife would work on a familiar! Had he attended my classes, he would have known better.
Phoenix:
In any case, there's no proof that the victim actually had a knife. (It's certain now that the professor and Maya weren't facing each other.)
Barnham:
Next witness, you may...um, sing us your testimony.
Birdly:

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
It's, uhh...a beautiful song, sure. But would you mind testifying in a bit more of a... comprehensible way?
Birdly:
As you wish, Sir Musically Impaired Defender. A certain man was killed some three months ago.
Phoenix:
You mean Sir Newton Belduke, the alchemist, right?
Birdly:
It was a "locked room murder", accomplished through the use of a certain mysterious spell.
Phoenix:
And that same magic has been used in this case too.
Birdly:
The witch that committed the crime disappeared without a trace.
Phoenix:
She hasn't been found to this day, huh...
Birdly:
............ That's pretty much what I expressed in my song.
Phoenix:
I knew all that already.
Birdly:
Even a peerless bard such as myself may not always be completely up to date with all the latest information. Isn't that so, Cracker? You understand, don't you, my peerless feathery partner?

Espella:
What an adorable bird! He's imitating you this time, Mr Wright!
Phoenix:

Barnham:
We capture all witches. Without exception. This one may have been at large longer than others...but she will not escape us.
Judge:
Next witness, continue testifying.
Luke:
It happened because the professor unravelled the mystery behind all these witches...
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
And that mystery is...?
Luke:
The witch's identity, of course!
Phoenix:
(Can't believe I'm getting stared down by a little kid...)
Luke:
............ Don't get me wrong. I want to believe you and Maya.
Phoenix:
...!
Luke:
But...I saw the witch's sceptre on the floor! No one else could've dropped it. When I saw the professor, everything went black in front of my eyes...but I did hear the sceptre fall to the floor. There was a witch in that room...and it had to be Maya!
Maya:
Luke...
Luke:
If only the professor were here to tell me what to believe in...
Espella:
What do you think, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
We need to dig down to the truth as soon as possible. For Maya...and for Luke, too.
Espella:
I hope we can do it...
Phoenix:
(It'd be easier if there were some clear contradictions in their testimonies, but I haven't noticed anything...)
Espella:
Perhaps this time... we should take a step back and observe each witness while they're not the one speaking.
Phoenix:
(The four of them are listening to each other's testimonies... That may give me an opportunity to question them on one another's testimonies and find gaps in their story.) You're full of good ideas, Espella. How about we give that a shot?
Espella:
Sure!
Phoenix:
Mister, do you have something you'd like to share with us?
Emeer:
............
Phoenix:
Mr Emeer!
Emeer:
It's Mr Emeer Punchenbaug I to you, Bluey! The likes of you oughta show some respect for a future man of wealth such as me.
Phoenix:
You seem to be looking ahead to a future full of newly gained riches...
Emeer:
I can look wherever I bleedin' please! A-anyway, why yer lookin' at me like that? I dunno 'bout that golden bloke's right arm!
Espella:
Excuse me, Mr Wright...
Phoenix:
Hm? What is it, Espella?
Espella:
I may be wrong, but... there's something about that man. Wouldn't you say he looks, uhm... suspicious?
Phoenix:
It's not just you. Everything about him is so shady it makes me want to double-check my pockets... Mr Emeer, stop pretending you don't know anything about the victim's missing arm!
Emeer:
P-p-pretendin'? I told ya, I know nothin'! Nada! Zero! Nil! I ain't seen it. Or heard about it. Or put it in me pocket.
Phoenix:
Put it in your pocket...?
Emeer:
It wasn't me, honest! Seriously, I've got nothin' to do with it!
???:
???:
Emeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer! You lying, cheating good-for-nothing! You've tried to deceive me!
Judge:
O-order! Order! Who is that person?
Price:
You want to know who I am? I'm Price the pawnbroker! And this man is a shameless, cheating bum! He had the nerve to lie to me!
Judge:
What did he lie to you about?
Price:
I'll tell you! On the day of the crime, Emeer came to my shop... He waltzed up to me saying he'd got his hands on a superb work of art, rare as gold dust!
Phoenix:
I think I know where this is going...
Barnham:
That "work of art"...could it be...?
Price:
I've got it right here.
Phoenix:
Just like I thought...
Barnham:
That's...!
Judge:
Oh my...
Luke:
Professor... It's the professor's arm!
Price:
It's pure gold, exquisitely crafted. It was entitled...hmm..."Towards Tomorrow", or something like that. I'd never seen a piece of gold so fine before... And so, suspecting nothing, I paid that rascal a rather handsome sum.
Judge:
Who would have thought...
Price:
And what am I hearing now?! That it was a human arm, no less! You, sir, are a monster! You're as bad as a witch's familiar yourself!
Emeer:
I didn't know it was his arm, I swear! When I saw it, it was already like that!
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Emeer:
I was last to the scene, and it caught me eye right away!
That golden arm, pointing up at the ceiling with such optimism and authority! I thought, it looks like it's showing me the way to a better, brighter, richer tomorrow!
To me, it was a work of art! A precious one, at that!
Judge:
And then it found its way into your pocket and you pawned it?
Barnham:
You mounted it on a crude stand, gave it a tawdry title and passed it off as some kind of a sculpture...
Emeer:
............
Phoenix:
Don't try and look away from the truth now!
Emeer:
Darn it! I can look wherever I darn please! I'll look away from the facts and forward to the future! Always look on the bright side!
That's Emeer Punchenbaug's motto!
Judge:
Where were we now...ah, yes. The victim's arm has now been successfully reattached by one of our masterful craftsmen. Knights of the Court! You may resume the inquisition.
Phoenix:
At least one thing's clear now... As everyone can see, the victim definitely wasn't holding a knife!
Ms Primstone:
Oh dearie, dearie me! It seems I may have been mistaken after all. When you think about it, the victim had already been turned to gold when we entered the room.
Phoenix:
According to the witnesses' testimonies, that was the case, yes.
Ms Primstone:
Well then, I'm sure you'll concede that it was easy to mistake that glittering pointing finger for a knife.
Barnham:
Indeed, the victim's finger has a glint to it resembling that of a sword's edge.
Judge:
Such a sense of power and intensity... It's enough to send a shiver down the spine of anyone being pointed at.
Luke:
No puzzle is a match for the power of the professor's pointing finger!
Phoenix:
(I guess no one remembers I'm known for pointing like that too...)
Espella:
I think your pointing finger makes quite an impression too, Mr Wright!
Phoenix:
(She's just taking pity on me...)
Barnham:
Is that all you had to say, Sir Blue Knight?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Barnham:
As I said before, whether the victim had a knife or not... is completely irrelevant.
Emeer:
Y-yeah, what he said! You'd better apologise to me now! Badgerin' me for no reason like that...
Phoenix:
(Is that all there is to it? Or could that arm hold some other clues...?)
Espella:
We've come this far... Maybe there's something else you could ask about.
Phoenix:
(She's right. I need to ask some more questions.) Well then, Mr Emeer. Perhaps you could tell me one more thing about that arm.
When did you find it?
Phoenix:
Can you tell me when you found the arm?
Emeer:
I told ya before, it was when I entered that room. It really kinda stood right out, y'see! Glitterin' on the floor like that...ya couldn't miss it!
Judge:
And yet, no one else noticed it. How do you explain that?
Emeer:
I guess they must've been lookin' at the golden hat guy when he fell down. I was the last to enter the room, so I noticed the arm before the, uhm...rest.
Barnham:
And as soon as you noticed it, you slipped it into your pocket like a common thief?
Emeer:
Eh heh heh...
Judge:
This is no laughing matter, witness.
Espella:
Well, Mr Wright? Maybe he knows something else we could use!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I suppose I'd better ask him about something else.)
Leads back to:
"Well then, Mr Emeer."
How much did you pawn it for?
Phoenix:
Why don't you tell me how much you got for that arm?
Emeer:
Huh?
Phoenix:
All that glitter you're wearing... The money for that must have come from somewhere. And if you managed to buy all that for the price of one arm... It must've been worth a small fortune. It is gold, after all...
Emeer:
............
Judge:
............
Espella:
............
Emeer:
A-are you... thinking of selling it? The whole body?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Barnham:
You have lost my respect, Blue Knight... Apparently you are no more than a greedy knight blinded by the glitter of gold.
Maya:
How could you, Nick?!
Luke:
Professor!
Phoenix:
(Ugh...I shouldn't have asked. They all took it the wrong way...)
Espella:
I won't judge you, Mr Wright... But for now, let's ask him something else. Maybe he knows something we could use!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, guess I'd better ask him about something else.)
Leads back to:
"Well then, Mr Emeer."
Where was it lying?
Leads to:
"You found the arm on the floor, pointing upwards, you said?"
Phoenix:
You found the arm on the floor, pointing upwards, you said?
Emeer:
Yeah, I did! Finders keepers, I say! It was pointing straight up at the ceiling.
Barnham:
The arm somehow happened to fall down in such a way that it landed upright.
Phoenix:
(What are the odds of that? Actually, that reminds me of a puzzle...) Now, if you could just show us on this floor plan here... I'd like to know the exact spot where you found the victim's arm.
Emeer:
Sure, I remember that well. It was...right there.
Judge:
Hmph, yes. That's where you would expect it to have fallen.
Phoenix:
............ (Now, if that's where it was... then something's definitely not right.)
Barnham:
If you keep looking at that sketch so intensely, you shall burn a hole in it. Or perhaps... you're going to claim there's a contradiction in it somewhere?
Phoenix:
(This arm is the final clue left by the professor... Even after turning to gold, he was pointing out something important... Namely, the key to solving this case!)
Judge:
Well, defender? Do you see any problems in the locations as marked on the sketch?
No, everything's fine
Phoenix:
(It's no use. There's nothing odd in the sketch.) ...No, it's all good.
Judge:
Very well. Inquisitor Barnham, you may proceed.
Barnham:
It took us longer than expected, but we have finally managed to ascertain some facts. The defendant attacked the victim using two magic spells enabled by the witch's sceptre found at the crime scene. The witnesses each saw the very moment at which the victim turned to gold and collapsed. And then the witch dropped the witch's sceptre.
Phoenix:
(This is bad...there's nothing here I can object to!)
...-ick... ...NICK...
Phoenix:
...! (That voice!)
Maya:
I didn't have a sceptre! Look at the sketch again, Nick!
Phoenix:
M-Maya! (The sketch? But I DID look at it...)
Espella:
Mr Wright! I've been thinking about it... and I'm sure Mr Layton must have left us a hint somewhere!
Phoenix:
(There's gotta be something in the crime scene sketch! Maybe it'll jump out at me as soon as I raise an objection...) Your Honour! The defence would like to withdraw its previous statement!
Barnham:
What did you say...?
Phoenix:
Please, if you'll all take a look at this floor plan... you'll notice that there's a contradiction in the location of the arm!
Judge:
To claim this at such an advanced stage of the trial... I trust you understand that you will be held accountable, should this prove to be a waste of our time.
Phoenix:
(Yeah...I get the picture! But there's no time to worry about that...)
Leads to:
"In that case, why don't you enlighten us and show us this so-called contradiction?"
Actually, there is a problem
Phoenix:
Of course there is a problem.
Barnham:
Pshh! And where would that be, precisely?
Phoenix:
The professor's arm has armed me with some vital evidence. Its location leads to a huge contradiction!
Leads to:
"In that case, why don't you enlighten us and show us this so-called contradiction?"
Judge:
In that case, why don't you enlighten us and show us this so-called contradiction? What contradiction does the victim's arm create?
Present Talea Magica
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The contradiction is right here!"
Present golden arm
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The contradiction is right here!
Judge:
And this is...the victim's arm?
Phoenix:
Yeah! Would a broken arm fall on its end and stand up neatly like that? It's even less likely than a coin landing on its edge!
Judge:
............
Barnham:
............
Layton:
............
Judge:
Defender... This is not so much a contradiction as merely an oddity.
Barnham:
An oddity reminiscent of yourself, foolish Blue Knight.
Espella:
I'm sure if you knocked Mr Layton's statue down a hundred times, his arm would end up like that at least once!
Luke:
Knowing the professor...I bet it would happen!
Phoenix:
(Okay, okay, I get it. My mistake.)
Barnham:
You appear to be looking away from the facts, rather like a certain witness.
Phoenix:
I won't look away from my mistakes... but I will keep looking on the bright side! (...And on the bright side, that's one possibility eliminated. All the more chance of getting it right next time!)
Leads back to:
"In that case, why don't you enlighten us and show us this so-called contradiction?"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The contradiction is right here!
Judge:
Hmph... What say you, Inquisitor Barnham?
Barnham:
I believe that was a definitive proof... that there is a contradiction here. Not in the sketch, but rather in this court. That contradiction is you, Sir Blue Knight. Perhaps you had better go back to your bakery.
Phoenix:
Huh...
Espella:
I think...what Inquisitor Barnham means to say is that your objection was a little off the mark. I could be wrong, of course...
Phoenix:
Ugh. Yeah, I got that, Espella. I'm not that clueless... (I've got to get it right next time! I don't want to make a fool of myself again...)
Barnham:
You appear to be looking away from the facts, rather like a certain witness.
Phoenix:
I won't look away from my mistakes... but I will keep looking on the bright side! (...And on the bright side, that's one possibility eliminated. All the more chance of getting it right next time!)
Leads back to:
"In that case, why don't you enlighten us and show us this so-called contradiction?"
Phoenix:
The contradiction is right here!
Judge:
And this is...the witch's sceptre...?
Phoenix:
Let's go over the order of events, as per the witnesses' testimonies. First, the witch cast a spell on the professor, turning him to gold. When all of you rushed to the crime scene, that golden statue fell down, making a loud noise. Next, the witch dropped the sceptre.
Barnham:
What are you getting at, Sir Blue Knight? All witnesses agree with this order of events.
Phoenix:
That's right. They all agree that's how it happened... But then there's the arm.
Barnham:
Well, what about it? Spit it out.
Phoenix:
Let's assume that Maya was the witch... Now, look at the sketch again. The witch dropped the sceptre after having turned the professor into gold. The sceptre tumbled along the floor... and was found here, as asserted by the prosecution. However, that would be impossible. There's no way it could have been there!
Judge:
Oh... I see it now!
Barnham:
Ngh... The...arm...it was...
Phoenix:
I'm glad you seem to have noticed. The victim's arm was on the floor right here, standing on its end. Therefore, the sceptre couldn't possibly have fallen that way. Ergo, it couldn't have been the defendant who dropped the sceptre! In other words, Maya is not a witch!
Barnham:
Nghhhhh!
Judge:
Order! Order! Orderrr! How can this be...? The inquisition's reasoning has been proven invalid through just one single piece of unusual evidence!
Phoenix:
(Call it Layton's magical touch! The professor sacrificed his arm to leave us just the evidence needed to turn this thing around!)
Espella:
That was amazing, Mr Wright!
Luke:
Professor...
Barnham:
Barnham:
An admirable deduction, Sir Blue Knight. ...That I cannot deny. Even if we are to assume your reasoning is correct and that girl in the cage is not a witch...
Phoenix:
"Even if"...?
Barnham:
in [sic] the many trials I have attended, I have become well-versed in certain aspects of magic. I am all too aware of its potential to confuse people, befuddle their minds and make their memories hazy... No one can resist such a maddening influence.
Phoenix:
What are you trying to say, Inquisitor?
Barnham:
The sceptre could not have tumbled across the floor if the arm were in its way. ...However! Can we be sure that is where the arm was? Are all of the witnesses able to confirm its location at the time?
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
We've heard what they had to say several times now! They agreed that the sceptre fell after the victim fell over!
Barnham:
Barnham:
And yet, no one actually saw the sceptre being dropped. Witnesses. Think back to that incident once more. Did the golden statue fall over first...or did the staff fall before it? Think carefully about what you have seen and heard. Everything hinges on your testimonies. May your words guide us to the truth and decide the fate of this caged "witch"!
Luke:

Emeer:

Ms Primstone:

Judge:
I was about to get ready to leave...but it seems there is need for further questioning. Testify once more, witnesses! Tell us of the golden statue and the Talea Magica!
Witness Testimony
- The Golden Statue and the Sceptre -
Luke:
I was only focusing on the professor, so I don't remember much else.
Emeer:
I dunno...I got there last. 'Sides, that thing was glintin' and glitterin' away, so I couldn't see much else.
Birdly:

Ms Primstone:
Dearie me, I remember! How obvious it seems now. The staff was dropped before the statue fell over.
Phoenix:
Whoa, wait a minute! What you all said just now... is totally different from your previous testimonies!
Barnham:
...Sir Blue Knight. You are starting to notice it now, aren't you? That is the way of magic. Such is the effect this black art tends to have upon those who witness it. The witnesses are not lying, but simply having trouble remembering the truth.
Phoenix:
(What a convenient excuse... Confronted with magic, their brains turn to mush, huh?)
Judge:
Ever since our ancestors drank from the fountains of wisdom and obtained the capacity for reason... witchcraft has been the one thing to remain incomprehensible, even to the most intelligent of us.
Barnham:
Nevertheless, the onus is on us to stand up against magic and pass judgement on these witches! And so, here we are, doing battle with the weapons of the wise: words. With words, we shall pass judgement upon this supposed witch.
Judge:
Defender, you may begin your interrogation and help us arrive at the truth!

Phoenix:
Luke. You said before that you heard the sceptre fall to the floor... And that was after the professor fell over.
Luke:
............ I thought so... I mean, I thought so before, but now... The more I think about it, the less certain I am that I actually heard it! How could I have been paying attention to anything else when the professor was... When he was... *sob* My memories of everything else are too fuzzy...
Phoenix:
(I guess Luke was too shocked to take in his surroundings and notice anything else... I doubt I'll get any more information out of him for now.) I'm sorry, Luke. I understand how hard this is for you.

Birdly:
I shall simplify it once more just for you, esteemed Knight of the Court. First of all, let's talk about love. It's a pretty neat slant rhyme for "cove". A "cove" is slang for a "chap", you see. Then we have the word witch and its homophone which.
Question Emeer Punchenbaug
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Mr Emeer, you seem to be pondering something very deeply.
Emeer:
Bwah! Ya caught me unawares there, Bluey!
Phoenix:
Did something in Mr Birdly's statement catch your attention just now?
Emeer:
Nah. Nothin' in particular. I was just thinkin'... That bard's song really got to me... I really kinda feel it in me heart.
Birdly:
I appreciate your appreciation of my art.
Emeer:
Y'know, I meant to ask you somethin'... Why don't you become me private bard? You could sing all about the heroic life of Emeer Punchenbaug I!
Birdly:
I could gladly sing of your adventures if it pleases you, kind sir.
Emeer:
Yeah, that's exactly what I want! Show me what ya've got!
Birdly:
Very well. As per your request...

Sometimes it is best not to probe too deeply, Sir Blue Knight.
Judge:
Well, then... Let us just pretend we heard none of that and proceed with the interrogation.

Phoenix:
Ugh... Right...
Birdly:
Next, we have the delightful consonance of beloved and bewitched. It is, ultimately, a song about confusion.
Phoenix:
I'm confused...
Birdly:
............ To be honest, there's nothing more to it. It is merely an artistic expression of my feelings.
Phoenix:
So...it's got nothing to do with this case, does it?
Birdly:
I am a well of melodious words and poetic music. That is my only claim.
Cracker:
Aaaaaah! Oh dearie, dearie me!
Question Luke Triton
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Leads to:
"Luke, would you like to say something?"
Birdly:
Oh, what could my peerless partner Cracker be thinking about now, I wonder. Perhaps I should sing a song about it...
Phoenix:
No, please...that's fine.
Judge:
I don't believe another song will be necessary. Let us move on.
Ms Primstone:
Dearie me, I remember! How obvious it seems now. The staff was dropped before the statue fell over.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But...you haven't said anything about that until now!
Ms Primstone:
Well, that couldn't have been helped.
Phoenix:
How so?
Ms Primstone:
Now, now, everyone, listen well! Pencils in hand, be sure to take notes. Ms Primstone's lesson number four! "Memories are not always pretty". Some things are better forgotten. Trying to remember them only leads to trouble! This will be in the exam!
Barnham:
You are saying that the victim fell over and his arm broke off after the sceptre was dropped, are you not?
Ms Primstone:
Correct! Well done. And so, the contradiction is no more.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But that's inconsistent with all the previous testimonies!
Barnham:
Barnham:
You're quick to forget what I have told you, Sir Blue Knight. The witnesses are not lying. They are merely having trouble remembering the truth. We must do our utmost to find the truth within what they say.
Phoenix:
(It's no use... These guys aren't making any sense.)
Espella:
What Inquisitor Barnham said must be true... They've been confused by magic!
Phoenix:
Espella...
Espella:
We always try to make sense of what we see. So when what we see makes no sense, we lose track of what's real.
Phoenix:
(I guess that makes cross-examination a little pointless... At least, when everyone here believes it's so easy to get confused by magic.) Well, we need to do something, or else Maya will be done for... I'll listen to the witnesses again and try to find something we can use...
Espella:
Good luck!
Phoenix:
Luke, would you like to say something?
Luke:
............ Oh...sorry. Guess I spaced out a bit. What is it, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
You seemed to be thinking pretty hard about something during Mr Birdly's song...err, testimony just now. Is there something you would like to share with us?
Luke:
............ Well... I've been thinking about what Mr Barnham said a while ago...
Phoenix:
What was that, exactly?
Luke:
That humans who witness magic become confused and lose sight of what's real... and they end up not knowing what actually happened... Well, I was thinking Mr Barnham might be right. And then...it occurred to me that there might be a way... I mean, we do have with us...
a witness who isn't human!
Cracker:
Aaaaaah! Oh dearie, dearie me!
Phoenix:
This situation seems oddly familiar...
Luke:
I asked him earlier if he remembers the events clearly or not. He said he has a memory better than an elephant and remembers everything perfectly well!
Phoenix:
(Ah, that's right! I almost forgot...Luke can talk to animals!)
Luke:
Mr Wright, I know it sounds crazy... but please let me try! Let me ask Cracker to testify!
Cracker:
Aaaaaah! Oh dearie, dearie me!
Phoenix:
(Should I...? I'm stuck now anyway, and the witnesses' testimonies are all over the place... A new testimony would be a wild card, but it might be just the thing to turn this trial on its head! But it's a crazy idea, all right... If I make a mistake now, it'll put me in a tight spot!)
Judge:
Defender, are you still with us? This is not the time nor place for daydreaming. What do you intend to do?
Barnham:
Heh...it looks as though you've exhausted all means for a counter-attack, Sir Knight in Blue. Is it not time you drop your sword?
Judge:
If you have no further questions for the witnesses, defender, I will consider your interrogation finished. What will it be then? Are we finished here?

Barnham:

Cracker:
Mister! Cracker!
Phoenix:
The defence summons its new witness, Mr Cracker the Parrot!
Judge:
A... A parrot as a witness?!
Barnham:
Barnham:
This is the Witches' Court! Joking around will be considered contempt of court!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Mr Cracker witnessed the crime. He saw it happen...and he heard it too! He's as valid a witness as the others!
Barnham:
Barnham:
No, no, no! That bird is nothing but a pet animal! Referring to it as "Mr" will not change that!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Humans are confused by magic, to the extent that they lose sight of what's real... That's what you yourself said, Inquisitor Zacharias Barnham!
Barnham:
Barnham:
Calling me by my full name does not help justify such brash foolishness! The inquisition is against interrogating a parrot!
???:
By the way, kind sirs...
Birdly:
I suppose you should know that my dear companion never forgets a sound he hears.
Barnham:
...!
Phoenix:
(He remembers everything he hears, huh...)
Luke:
It's definitely worth asking Cracker to testify!
Judge:
The court sees the situation as follows... The witnesses' testimonies do not hold together. In fact, they are as erratic as that bard's songs. I cannot see this trial getting any more confusing. Very well...the defence may summon this avian witness!
...Can you believe it?...What's up with Mr Blue Suit? Summoning a parrot as a witness?...S-summoning? Does he mean like how the familiar was "summoned"?
Phoenix:
(By hook or by crook, I'll do whatever I can to save Maya! Be it summoning a parrot or a familiar... whatever it takes. Within the boundaries of the law, of course.)
Phoenix:
Umm, all right. Witness, state your name and profe-
Barnham:
Barnham:
Not so fast! I hardly even know where to begin, but... First of all... What's the matter with that boy, looking so pleased with himself? He looks like the cat that got the cream.
Luke:
Ah, that'd be me, wouldn't it? Don't mind me... Just think of me as a perch for Cracker, that's all.
Barnham:
And just what is the purpose of questioning a bird?! A parrot may be able to repeat what others say, but it cannot talk on its own!
Luke:
Luke:
It's precisely because Cracker doesn't talk in his own words that he's certain to tell us the truth!
Barnham:
What?
Luke:
Cracker remembers every sound he hears, even just the once, with absolute perfection. So let's have him testify exactly what he heard!
Phoenix:
And if Cracker can repeat every sound... I'd say this should be a valuable testimony!
Barnham:
I cannot believe this is happening...
Judge:
A witness that cannot talk will not lie, either. This idea is much to my liking. Well then. May our new witness, Cracker, testify to the court! We wish to know exactly what you heard from the beginning of the incident!
Witness Testimony

Cracker:
...Aaaaah!...Slam!...Dearie, dearie me!...Clang!...Godoor!
Barnham:
Barnham:
What's this now...?
Luke:
Why, those are the sounds of the incident... exactly as Cracker heard them!
Barnham:
Ludicrous! Evidently, this is nothing but a farce after all!
Judge:
What do you mean, Inquisitor Barnham? I must admit I found the parrot's testimony quite impressive.
Barnham:
Even if that bird can accurately recall the sounds... it is clearly useless when it comes to... the order of events!
Judge:
You mean there's a problem with the order?
Barnham:
First, the witch used magic to turn the victim into gold. Then, the witnesses arrived. It is reasonable to assume they cried out in terror when they did so. And yet, this testimony does not accurately convey such an order of events!
It starts with a sudden scream. Followed by the door abruptly opening... and then a witness crying out. Next, we hear the victim, having turned into gold, falling down. So far, so reasonable... But the real issue is as follows.
The parrot seems to think the witch cast her spell after the witnesses entered. Such a suggestion is inconceivable! The reason is simple. At that time, the victim had already been turned into gold!
Luke:
Ah...
Judge:
Hmph... Indeed, it is as you say, Inquisitor Barnham.
Barnham:
The parrot's capacity for imitation is excellent. I will concede that its testimony does have some entertainment value. However! This animal's testimony cannot be allowed to stand as proof in this honourable court of law!
Luke:
Don't write Cracker off just like that!
Barnham:
Do you now see how foolish you were to summon this parrot as a witness?
Phoenix:
(Ughhh...not good, Phoenix. Not good at all... Should I really go through with this cross-examination when it feels like everyone in this court is against me?)

Barnham:
What? Are you serious?! Did you not hear what I said? Are you choosing to ignore MY words?
Phoenix:
A witness that cannot talk cannot lie, either. This parrot's testimony is the naked truth. He's simply repeating the sounds as he heard them.
Barnham:
...!
Phoenix:
It's humans who make assumptions about the meaning of those sounds and arbitrarily decide whether the testimony's good or not. But, as Knights of the Court, shouldn't we be striving to uncover the truth to which this parrot holds the key?
Barnham:
............ The truth, you say...? Very well! Show us the "truth" that this bird purportedly knows! Interrogate that parrot! Meanwhile, I shall enjoy the show.
Espella:
Will you? Will you do it, Mr Wright?

Ugh, do you think it's hopeless?

Present Goldor entry
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"There is a critical contradiction in this testimony!"
Espella:
Do you think there's anything important in Mr Cracker's testimony?
Phoenix:
Hmm. There does seem to be a fundamental problem with what he repeated... (Why would the incantation come after the professor was turned to gold?)
Espella:
But Mr Cracker can't tell lies, right?
Phoenix:
Yeah... He can only repeat the sounds he's heard. (Maybe we're just misinterpreting Cracker's testimony...) For the time being, let's have another look at the Court Record and the Grand Grimoire.
Espella:
Yes, of course!
Phoenix:
There is a critical contradiction in this testimony!
Barnham:
We are all aware of that, Sir Blue Knight. This contradiction is between your so-called desire to find the truth and the fact that you are interrogating a parrot!
Phoenix:
That's not what I'm talking about, Inquisitor. There is a contradiction here that makes one thing particularly clear... the fact that we have clearly all made a wrong assumption!
Barnham:
...How so?
Phoenix:
Luke, can you ask Cracker to repeat the incantation once more?
Luke:
R-right you are!
Cracker:
............ ...Godoor! ...Godoor!
Barnham:
G... "Godoor"...?
Phoenix:
According to the Grand Grimoire, the name of the gold transmutation spell is "Goldor"... Now, Inquisitor, it would seem to me that the spell we've just heard is in fact a different one entirely!
Judge:
Well I never... Unbelievable! "Goldor" and "Godoor"...
Barnham:
Barnham:
This... This is ridiculous! That wretched bird must've misheard the incantation!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Cracker is able to imitate sounds perfectly. The incantation was indeed misheard... but only by the people hearing it!
Barnham:
Barnham:
The victim was found already in his golden state. That is proof enough that the Goldor spell was used!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But you're forgetting that Cracker heard this incantation after that spell had already taken place! Which makes it entirely possible that this "Godoor" spell was used as well! In other words, another spell, besides the gold transmutation magic, must also have been used!
Barnham:
Nnngh...!
Judge:
A-another spell...that we haven't yet considered?!
Phoenix:
Now, the next question that needs to be asked is: just what is this Godoor spell?
Barnham:
Barnham:
Utter foolishness! This is absurd! As convenient as it would be for you, there is no way that a spell by the name of "Godoor" exists!
Espella:
Oh! Mr Wright!
Phoenix:
Huh? What is it?
Espella:
I've found it. The page about the spell... Godoor. It's listed in the Grand Grimoire...right here!
Judge:
It...
Barnham:
exists? [sic]
Judge:
Wha-whaaaaaaat? Order! Order! I demand order!
Phoenix:
(Just like I thought. Cracker remembered it exactly.)
Judge:
But then...what kind of magic is this "Godoor"?
Espella:
Well, Milord...the Grand Grimoire describes it in the following way... Godoor: "Creates a portal on two sides of green-coloured walls. The portal will disappear after five minutes".
Judge:
Creates a portal?
Barnham:
On green-coloured walls?
Phoenix:
A portal spell...
The spell Godoor has been bookmarked in the Grand Grimoire.
Barnham:
Aren't you a lucky man... It appears even the Grand Grimoire is on your side. However, there is a fatal flaw in your explanation.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
What...what flaw is that, Inquisitor?
Barnham:
It is really quite simple. Think back to how the alchemist's study looked at the time of the incident. Do you remember any green walls? Because I do not. There were none. All the walls were coated with white plaster. In other words... It was impossible to use Godoor in that room!
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
Hmph... I, too, have visited that alchemist's study since the incident. I remember very well that all the walls in that room were a dull shade of white!
Barnham:
Your little theory was interesting, Sir Knight in Blue. But it has proven to be nothing more than that - a mere wild guess. As long as you cannot prove that this Godoor spell was used, your little theory shall be considered no further.
Judge:
In all honesty, I was very surprised to learn of such a spell's existence. However... as long as it was impossible to have used this spell at the crime scene, your deduction leads us nowhere. So let me ask you now.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honour?
Judge:
Do you, perchance, have any proof that you could show us? Can you prove that it was feasible for the witch to have used Godoor in that room?
Phoenix:
(This is no coincidence! That spell must have been used at the crime scene! But do I have the proof that it was even possible to use Godoor...?)
Naturally, I have proof
Phoenix:
(It's been on my mind for a while... That inexplicable mark. It has to be the evidence that ties up all the loose ends!)
Leads to:
"The defence wishes to present evidence!"
Unfortunately, I don't have proof
Phoenix:
I hate to say it, but I don't have any proof, Your Honour.
Barnham:
Heh. The spell has been broken for you at last.
Espella:
Mr Wright! Are you going to just let it go like that?
Phoenix:
But, Espella, the walls in Belduke's study were white.
Espella:
That may be so. But would you have a look at this? The spell Godoor creates a portal on green walls, doesn't it?
Phoenix:
(Green...hmm...) Ah! (Wait... I think I might just have something!)
Leads to:
"The defence wishes to present evidence!"
Phoenix:
The defence wishes to present evidence!
Barnham:
Im...impossible...
Judge:
The determination in your eyes made me think you would. Now then, we shall allow the defence to present its evidence to the court! Present the proof that the spell Godoor was used at the scene of the crime!
Present Behind the Painting
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The walls in the study are coated with white plaster..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
...Here it is! Here's the proof!
Judge:
............ What do you think, Inquisitor Barnham?
Barnham:
Sir Blue Knight... I have a question for you. Godoor is a spell used to make portals appear in solid walls, is that correct?
Phoenix:
Umm, yeah, that sounds about right...
Barnham:
Well, fortunately we have several doors here already, so there is no need to resort to magic portals. Now, choose any door you like and leave the court!
Phoenix:
Arghhh!
Judge:
That is to say, presenting that piece of evidence was a mistake.
Phoenix:
(Dang! Why did I show them that? I've gotta have something better...right?)
Leads back to:
"Now then, we shall allow the defence to present its evidence to the court!"
Phoenix:
The walls in the study are coated with white plaster... Not all of them, though. There is just one spot which is green.
Judge:
Oh? There is?!
Phoenix:
I noticed it when investigating the crime scene. You may recall that there was a small painting behind the desk. And for some reason, the wall behind it was painted green.
Barnham:
It...it was what?!
Judge:
I recall seeing that painting myself, too. If we look at this floor plan... I'd say it was around here.
Espella:
Mr Wright, I'll mark it on the floor plan!
Floor Plan updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
It's been bothering me since I saw it. But now it's clear what it was. At the time of the incident, a portal opened up behind that painting! In other words, that was the wall utilised for the spell Godoor!
Barnham:
Barnham:
You're certainly persistent. You just want a portal to be there so much, don't you?
Phoenix:
The wall behind the painting was green, and that's a fact!
Barnham:
Incidentally, I remember that painting well. It was a small landscape piece. About the size of, say, an open Grand Grimoire.
Judge:
Yes, it was about that size, indeed. A small, adorable picture.
Barnham:
Even if a portal had opened in that small patch of green... no person would be able to pass through it. In fact, they'd just about be able to put their arm through, at the most. So will you please explain how a witch could possibly have escaped through a portal this small?
Espella:
He's right, Mr Wright! No one could've got through a portal that small!
Barnham:
Have you anything to say? Or are you so crushed by the realisation of your mistake that words fail you?
Phoenix:
............ The portal was too small for a person... It doesn't require much thinking to figure that out.
Barnham:
...!
Phoenix:
But that aside, a very obvious question remains. If it wasn't a human, then what could've passed through that portal?
Barnham:
You have put an interesting spin on things. Why don't you answer your own question? You talk as if you know everything, so please, enlighten us!
Phoenix:
(A small portal was opened in the wall at the crime scene... And I have all the clues as to what that could mean!) What went through the portal was...
The witch
Phoenix:
I'm thinking it might have been... the witch, after all.
Barnham:
...You don't sound very sure about that. Let me ask you this: how did the witch get through that tiny portal?
Phoenix:
Well, since it was a witch...she probably used magic.
Barnham:
Barnham:
Another brash claim, another excuse of magic! Just how many spells do you think a witch can cast?
Judge:
There are only two magic gems in this Talea Magica.
Barnham:
What's certain is this: the portal opened in that wall would have been about the size of this book. If there were a portal like that in this courtroom, I'd gladly squeeze you through it to get you out of my sight!
Phoenix:
Uwaaaahhh!
Judge:
Ahem, yes, well. Enough of this small talk. The defence's answer clearly made no sense.
Espella:
Mr Wright, don't let them make you feel small. Let's think about this one more time, and we'll surely find the right answer!
Leads back to:
"A small portal was opened in the wall at the crime scene..."
A small animal
Phoenix:
A human wouldn't be able to squeeze through that portal... which leaves us with just one other possibility. It was...a small animal! Like a ferret, or a cat, or maybe even a...
Luke:
Mr Wright, I'd appreciate if you stopped stealing glances at Cracker.
Cracker:
Hang on! Hang on! Squawk! Hang on! Hang on!
Birdly:
Are you suggesting that my peerless musical companion was somehow involved in this crime?
Barnham:
What's certain is this: the portal opened in that wall would have been about the size of this book. It would be too small for a person. As for your suggestion regarding small animals... Let me suggest that you leave this court.
Phoenix:
Uwaaaahhh!
Judge:
Ahem, yes, well. Enough of this small talk. The defence's answer clearly made no sense.
Espella:
Mr Wright, don't let them make you feel small. Let's think about this one more time, and we'll surely find the right answer!
Leads back to:
"A small portal was opened in the wall at the crime scene..."
Something else
Leads to:
"No human could have passed through a portal that small."
Phoenix:
No human could have passed through a portal that small. Even a witch couldn't have pulled that off.
Barnham:
Heh, so are you finally forsaking your mistaken assumptions?
Phoenix:
I haven't finished, Inquisitor. The fact remains that something else could have passed through that portal.
Barnham:
Oh? And just what would that be, Sir Blue Knight?
Phoenix:
(The portal was created after the professor had been turned into gold... The witch had a good reason behind that. She must have had to move something through that portal.)
Judge:
You have captured my curiosity. I'd like to know what passed through the portal! Tell us, what did the witch use that magic portal for?
Present Talea Magica
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Considering the state of the crime scene... there is just one possible answer."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Maybe...it was for this!
Barnham:
Barnham:
............ You know, Blue Knight... ...You make me wish I could use magic to create a portal myself. So that I could chuck you and that irritating pointing finger of yours out of this court!
Phoenix:
Huh...
Barnham:
If only you would leave through a portal and never show up in front of me again!
Phoenix:
Ughhhhhhhhhh!
Judge:
And remember this ancient wisdom: those who point fingers at others will have fingers pointed at them!
Phoenix:
(Looks like my reasoning was a bit off the mark...)
Espella:
Let's think about it again and give it another try, Mr Wright!
Phoenix:
(What could have passed through that small portal? Did something leave the room through it? Or...could something have entered the room through it? The witch created the portal for a reason... The answer has to be in the Court Record.)
Leads back to:
"You have captured my curiosity. I'd like to know what passed through the portal!"
Phoenix:
Considering the state of the crime scene... there is just one possible answer. And that is...the Talea Magica!
Barnham:
Barnham:
What...what's this now?! The Talea Magica was found at the crime scene! A portal has nothing to do with it!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Inquisitor Barnham, you're making the wrong assumption.
Barnham:
Wrong assumption?
Phoenix:
The witch wasn't trying to remove evidence from the crime scene... She wanted to plant it. She threw the witch's sceptre into the room through that portal!
Barnham:
Barnham:
You...you and your crazy theories! Do you even realise what you're saying? If she threw the staff into the room, that means...
Phoenix:
Exactly. She did it to deceive us. Her goal was to make us draw the wrong conclusions. When the incident took place, the witch herself wasn't in the room. She cast the spell from outside!
Barnham:
Whaaaaaat?!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order, I say!
Phoenix:
And that's not all. There's even more proof that the staff was thrown into the room from the outside.
Barnham:
Wha...what proof?
Phoenix:
That proof is none other than...Professor Layton's previously severed right arm!
Judge:
The victim's arm? How does that prove anything?
Phoenix:
None of the witnesses have testified they saw the witch's sceptre. However... a few of them claim to have heard it rattling across the floor.
Barnham:
That's right.
Phoenix:
Please take a look at this floor plan... Since the arm was standing upright here, we know the defendant couldn't have been the one to have dropped the sceptre. Now, think about it...where would you need to drop the sceptre from in order for it to end up here?
Judge:
Oh...oh!
Barnham:
Ngh...!
Phoenix:
That's right... The sceptre could only have come from the small portal created by the spell Godoor!
Judge:
This is most unexpected. The witch wasn't in the room when the crime occurred... Or, at least, that's the defence's claim.
Phoenix:
It's the only thing that explains all the contradictions we've run into.
Barnham:
Barnham:
Sir Blue Knight, with that imagination of yours you could aspire to write fantasy stories. A nice try, I must admit. However...this line of assertion is futile! There is a glaring contradiction in your words!
Judge:
Another "contradiction"? Whatever are you referring to, Inquisitor Barnham?
Barnham:
This is the Talea Magica that was used in this incident. As we have established, there are two magic gems in it. One for the gold transmutation spell, Goldor, and one for the shadow familiar spell, Famalia. A witch in possession of this staff would not have been able to cast Godoor!
Phoenix:
............ Yes...you're absolutely right. But you can't write off all the evidence supporting my theory as mere coincidence.
Barnham:
Why must your agreement always be followed by a "but"?
Phoenix:
What I'm getting at is... this Talea Magica...is not genuine!
Judge:
Not genuine...?
Phoenix:
That's right. And naturally, the one responsible for this deception is the real culprit of the crime!
Judge:
Enough of the suspense! It's too much for a man of my age... The defence shall reveal what is meant by this so-called deception!
Present Famalia gem
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"First, I want to clarify one thing."
Present Goldor gem
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I'm thinking it may be...this Goldor magic gem!
Judge:
What? The Goldor magic gem is fake?
Phoenix:
Think about it...magic that turns stuff into gold? I mean, that sort of thing only happens in fairy tales!
Judge:
............
Barnham:
............
Espella:
............
Judge:
Is this an attempt to make us believe the crime in question never actually occurred?
Barnham:
Behold your glittering friend beside you! Are you honestly trying to claim that gold transmutation magic does not exist?!
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I shouldn't have said that... Can't believe I made that mistake. The Goldor gem isn't a fake. But in that case, something else must be...)
Espella:
Mr Wright, please try again! Quickly think of something a little more probable!
Phoenix:
(It's easy to say...)
Leads back to:
"Enough of the suspense! It's too much for a man of my age..."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I'm thinking...this, here, is not real!
Judge:
I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying this whole sceptre is a fabrication?
Phoenix:
No...er, yes, actually! Who's to say this whole Talea Magica isn't a fake?! The real sceptre may still be out there, somewhere!
Barnham:
............ You know what's a fake? You are. You are a sham, Sir Blue Knight.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
The real defender may still be out there, somewhere.
Phoenix:
What...?
Espella:
I'm...suddenly a little ashamed to be standing here, at your side...
Phoenix:
(Ugh...that was a shot in the dark...and the only thing I hit was myself. The sceptre itself isn't a fake. I guess just a part of it isn't what it seems...)
Espella:
Mr Wright, please try again! Quickly think of something a little more probable!
Phoenix:
(Come on Espella, cut me some slack...)
Leads back to:
"Enough of the suspense! It's too much for a man of my age..."
Phoenix:
First, I want to clarify one thing. Can we be certain that the Talea Magica in question is authentic?
Barnham:
Without doubt. The metal rod in its centre is called the Spina Magica. The Witch's Mark on its tip is clearly visible and highly detailed. It is impossible to forge, even by the finest craftsmen in all Labyrinthia. I can guarantee you its authenticity.
Phoenix:
That leaves us with only one possibility. The forgery in question is... the Famalia magic gem!
Barnham:
Wh-what?!
Judge:
A...forged magic gem?!
Barnham:
Barnham:
That...is an insult to our investigators!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Only witches can use the power of these magic gems, can't they? So tell me, how can you know whether a magic gem is the real thing or not?
Barnham:
Barnham:
Hold it there! We know for certain that the spell Goldor was used! It is undoubtedly not forged!
Phoenix:
But what about Famalia? Did anyone actually see a familiar at the crime scene?
Barnham:
...! Tha...that's...
Judge:
Three months ago, when an investigation was carried out into Sir Belduke's death... the results yielded the following conclusion: the spell Famalia had been used to summon a familiar, which in turn carried out the murder.
Phoenix:
...And the witch used exactly that to her advantage. Another similar incident at the same crime scene...don't you think that would be the perfect opportunity... for the witch to frame the defendant for her crimes? The defendant would be blamed for both the professor and Sir Belduke's deaths... and she'd be taken for the real witch.
Judge:
Oh...
Phoenix:
That was the real culprit's objective!
Barnham:
............
Judge:
............
............
Judge:
...There is a chapter in the Magic Archive, an old collection of tales of the occult... about the way to test whether or not a magic gem is genuine.
Phoenix:
...!
Barnham:
How can we test it, Milord?
Judge:
It is very simple. A genuine magic gem is composed of a mineral with a density lower than that of pure water. All you need to do is see if the magic gem floats on water.
Barnham:
That is simple indeed...
Judge:
All non-magical minerals in our world, with the exception of sepiolite and a few other special kinds, sink in water. These eerily sparkling magic gems, however, will never sink when put into water. Bailiff! Remove this magic gem for immediate examination!
...The magic gem's a fake?...What's up with this trial! [sic] This is not how it was supposed to be!It's all right, darling, don't cry! You'll get to see a witch burning today... Sir Barnham never disappoints! Hush, now. There, there!Barnham! Barnham! Barnham! Barnham!
Judge:
Defender... If your theory is correct, this could be the biggest occult crime in history. But another important question remains. I wonder if you can answer it... Who is this supposed real witch that threw the Talea Magica through the portal?
Phoenix:
............ (The real witch... There's only one person that comes to mind. Frankly, I still find it hard to believe...but it's the only possibility... Once I indict her, there'll be no turning back... Knowing the consequences, should I... should I give them her name?)
Espella:
............ Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
...!
Espella:
In Labyrinthia, witches are punished by fire. I know you think that's going too far... But even in a world that seems so insane to you... those who take the lives of others must be punished. That's a universal law...isn't it?
Phoenix:
(The witch turned the professor into a golden statue. And that's not all... She took the life of the alchemist too. And now she's trying to pin the whole thing on Maya... I...I can't just let her get away with that!)
Judge:
Well, then... Defence, let us hear your theory. Who is this witch responsible for using Godoor and then throwing the sceptre through the resulting portal?
Present Jean Greyerl profile
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"When you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
...... (I...I can't do it! It's too much responsibility... What if I'm wrong and an innocent person gets burned because of me?!)
Barnham:
............ Are you aware of what decides a knight's true worth? It is their readiness to deal the final blow. The courage to raise their sword... Your sword hand is weak and shaky. It is not befitting a Knight of the Court!
Phoenix:
Gwahhh...!
Espella:
Mr Wright, are you feeling all right?
Phoenix:
The witch's power is not limited to magic spells. They have a much more fearsome ability... the ability to exploit our blind spots, to hide in the shadows and manipulate us. (Someone that malevolent deserves to be called a "witch". I've got to think about this again. I've got to focus on facts, not assumptions!)
Leads back to:
"Well, then... Defence, let us hear your theory."
Phoenix:
(When you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true. There's only one logical possibility. It has to be that person!) The real witch is...Jean Greyerl!
Judge:
Hmm? Greyerl? I've heard that name somewhere... Wait, isn't that the butler who served Sir Belduke?
Phoenix:
That's correct.
Barnham:
Barnham:
Psh! What's this about?! You seem to love rolling out these ridiculous suggestions, but you ignore the obvious... Jean Greyerl is male!
Phoenix:
Inquisitor Barnham, tell me one thing... Is it only females who can be witches?
Barnham:
Are you daft?! Of course it's only females!
Judge:
Never in the history of this court, has there ever been a male witch.
Barnham:
You're so utterly ignorant! You should be ashamed of yourself!
Phoenix:
...All right, well. I'd like to ask another question. Is Jean Greyerl...really a male?
Judge:
Hmm?
Barnham:
What... What a ludicrous question...
Phoenix:
The defence is certain... that Jean Greyerl is the witch responsible for using magic on Professor Layton!
Barnham:
Barnham:
Will you stop fooling around?! This is... a groundless accusation!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
"Groundless", you say? I'm afraid that's where you're wrong.
Barnham:
...!
Phoenix:
At the time of the crime, Jean Greyerl was in the room next to the alchemist's study. And one of the walls in that very room... was painted green!
Judge:
It...it was?
Phoenix:
What's more, that green wall... was the one adjacent to Sir Belduke's study!
Barnham:
What...?! This is madness!
Judge:
Inquisitor Barnham! Quickly, have the butler summoned to the court! Have Jean Greyerl brought here immediately!
Barnham:
Certainly, Milord. It shall be done.
???:
There is no need for that.
Greyerl:
I am here. I shall come down right away.
Judge:
Ah, it's you!
Greyerl:
Well then, Mr Wright. Shall we begin?
Phoenix:
...Jean Greyerl.
Judge:
It would seem this trial has turned in a new direction. I think we all need a bit of time to take it in. We shall take a brief intermission. Inquisition, defence...sharpen your swords and wits to prepare yourselves for the next stage of this battle.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honour!
Barnham:
It shall be done, Milord.
Judge:
By the time we resume, the examination into the magic gem should have ended as well. Now, the court is adjourned for a brief intermission!
To Be Continued...
Waiting Hall
Maya:
So...it's got to be that, uhm...young butler?
Phoenix:
I know what you're thinking. I couldn't quite believe it at first, either. But... The evidence and circumstances all point to the butler. He...or she, has to be the witch. At least... it'll be certain if the magic gem turns out to be a fake.
Maya:
............ But if that's the case...then Belduke's murderer was also...
Phoenix:
Yeah. It would be Greyerl.
Espella:
No, it can't be true! He wouldn't have done that!
Phoenix:
Espella?
Espella:
I know Jean. He held Sir Belduke in the greatest of respect. Jean didn't kill him! I'm sure of it!
Phoenix:
(Jean Greyerl...are you really what people think you are? There are still so many unknown factors in this trial...)
Espella:
Ah!
Luke:
............
Maya:
It's Luke!
Luke:
I... ............ I'm sorry, Maya! What I did is unforgivable!
Maya:
............ What are you saying, Luke? All you did was testify about what you saw.
Luke:
But...but...I...should've trusted you!
Maya:
Well, you trust us now, right?
Luke:
Maya...
Espella:
Anyway, Luke, it was thanks to you that we discovered new information.
Luke:
Thanks to me?
Maya:
Sure! You got Cracker to testify. That was a great idea! I wish I could talk to animals! Don't you too, Espella?
Espella:
Oh, yes. I'd love to have a chat with Eve!
Maya:
So, Luke...will you teach us how to do it? Pretty please!
Luke:
Uhm, yeah, of course! I can try.
Maya:
Yay! That's a promise, right?
Luke:
...... Uhm, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Hmm? What is it, Luke?
Luke:
Do you mind if I join you from now on?
Phoenix:
Not at all, Luke.
Luke:
I realised during the trial... that in this strange town, even what you see with your own eyes may not be real. That's why...I'm not giving up yet! Professor...I know he'll return! We can't give up hope!
Maya:
You know, that's what I've been thinking too.
Luke:
Really?
Maya:
I have a feeling he'll reappear again when we get into trouble and help us out. Because, I mean...it's the professor we're talking about here!
Luke:
Right!
Maya:
And remember what he always says: Look forward to the future! Always look on the bright side!
Phoenix:
(Err...I don't think it was the professor who said that...)
Defender! Accused! The intermission's over. Return to the courtroom!
Maya:
...!
Espella:
...!
Luke:
...!
Phoenix:
Let's go. It's time to bring this trial to a close.
Luke:
Oh... I have something for you, Mr Wright! Here, please take it. Maybe it'll come in handy in the trial.
Phoenix:
A letter, huh? Let's see who it's from... Wait... "Newton Belduke"? (There are several sheets of parchment inside, but they're all blank...)
Luke:
The professor and I got this when we went to see the Storyteller!
Phoenix:
Thank you, Luke! The more info we have the better.
Luke:
You're welcome!
Blank Letter added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I've got no proof that it was Jean Greyerl who turned the professor into gold... Even if the magic gem is a fake, it's still not decisive evidence. I don't know what will happen next... But I do know this battle's far from over.)
Witches' Court
Judge:
We will now resume the trial of Maya Fey. First things first, the Occult Crime Analysts have finished examining the evidence... They have tested the two magic gems from the witch's sceptre.
Phoenix:
...!
Barnham:
...!
Judge:
"Goldor floated on the surface of the water, whereas Famalia sank."
Espella:
It was said that genuine magic gems float in pure water, wasn't it?
Judge:
Thus, it has been established... that the Famalia magic gem is a fake! Order! Order! Order in court! This does not prove that Godoor was used, of course. Nonetheless... The defence's theory does now seem more plausible. The court considers it worth looking into. ...You have no objection to that, do you, Inquisitor Barnham?
Barnham:
............ No, Milord.
Talea Magica updated in the Court Record.
Judge:
Now then, bring in the witness!
Barnham:
Witness, state your name and profession.
Greyerl:
My name is Jean Greyerl. I served the late Master Belduke... Since his death, I have been tending to his dwelling and putting his research materials in order.
Phoenix:
...? (Hmm, I don't know what it is, but... I feel like there's something a bit different about Greyerl today.)
Greyerl:
............
Judge:
Witness... There is something we need to clarify first of all. As you are no doubt aware, you have been accused of being a witch...
Barnham:
Therefore, it is vital that you tell us... Are you a boy or a girl?
Greyerl:
Please hold on.
Judge:
Why...what is it?
Greyerl:
Excuse my rudeness, Milord, but at this time... I do not intend to answer that question.
Phoenix:
...!
Barnham:
Why do you refuse to answer, witness?
Greyerl:
I had been following this trial from the gallery and so am fully aware of the utterly absurd accusations made against me. Alchemy, the art pursued by Master Belduke, is concerned with the rules and logic that govern nature. As someone who had been helping Master Belduke for quite some time, I dare say your theory is both illogical and impossible.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The witch's sceptre was thrown into the crime scene through a portal, created by the magical spell Godoor. That portal could only have been opened from your room. And what's more...one of the walls in your room is painted green!
Greyerl:
I believe anyone is free to paint their walls in whichever colour they please. Besides... your theory relies on one magic gem being a fake. While that may have been proven true, another question has arisen... where could the genuine magic gem be?
Phoenix:
...! It...it must have been swapped with the fake one and discarded somewhere...
Greyerl:
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Phoenix:
Why?
Greyerl:
If we assume, as you have claimed, that the witch used the spell Godoor... that would mean the magic gem must have been swapped after creating the portal. So tell me, when and where would the witch have disposed of the magic gem?
Barnham:
I see your point. Several people paid witness to the incident, and the Knights of the Inquisition arrived at the scene immediately after. During that time, no one left the building and the whole place was meticulously searched.
Greyerl:
Naturally, my room was searched as well. Although there was not much to see, as I have few personal belongings.
Barnham:
Despite our inspection, nothing resembling a magic gem was found. I assure you, we have not overlooked anything. I would swear to it on my honour as a knight.
Phoenix:
...!
Greyerl:
So, Mr Wright. If you wish to accuse me of being a witch... should you not first prove that there is a connection between me and this missing magic gem? Furthermore, I would appreciate it if you could please approach the matter in a rational way, like an alchemist.
Phoenix:
(The house was searched very soon after the crime... If the gem wasn't found, then it means Greyerl hid it somewhere. Somewhere the Knights of the Inquisition would not have looked. Where could it be?)
Judge:
The witness has made a valid argument. How will the defence respond?
Phoenix:
............ The knights who searched Sir Belduke's premises weren't looking for a magic gem. That's why...there is a certain place they didn't consider searching.
Barnham:
Interesting. You really don't give up easily, do you? In that case, perhaps you could tell us all where the magic gem is!
In Belduke's study
Phoenix:
It's...in Sir Belduke's study!
Barnham:
The study? You mean to suggest it's at the crime scene?
Judge:
Defence, show us the location of the magic gem. Where is the magic gem hidden?
Present anywhere
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
...How about here?!
Barnham:
Barnham:
I told you before... Every nook and cranny of that room has been searched... I can assure you of that, as the head of the Knights of the Inquisition. Why don't you commit my confident words to your memory, Sir Blue Knight?
Phoenix:
Ark! (Okay, it's not Johnny Smiles we're talking about here. They actually did a good job...)
Espella:
Sir Barnham does look rather confident.
Luke:
He seems pretty certain that the search was done thoroughly!
Phoenix:
Yeah, you're right... (And yet the witch managed to hide the gem where she knew the knights wouldn't look. I think...I might just have an idea as to where that might be.)
Barnham:
Sir Blue Knight, I see there's still a faint glimmer of hope in your eyes. Perhaps you can come up with a better answer next time.
Leads back to:
"In that case, perhaps you could tell us all where the magic gem is!"
In Greyerl's room
Phoenix:
It's...in Greyerl's room!
Greyerl:
...Did Inquisitor Barnham not say that my room was thoroughly searched?
Judge:
Well then, defence... Perhaps you would like to show us the location of the magic gem. Do you have a suggestion as to where it is hidden?
Present anywhere
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
...How about here?!
Barnham:
Barnham:
I told you before... Every nook and cranny of that room has been searched... I can assure you of that, as the head of the Knights of the Inquisition. Why don't you commit my confident words to your memory, Sir Blue Knight?
Phoenix:
Ark! (Okay, it's not Johnny Smiles we're talking about here. They actually did a good job...)
Espella:
Sir Barnham does look rather confident.
Luke:
He seems pretty certain that the search was done thoroughly!
Phoenix:
Yeah, you're right... (And yet the witch managed to hide the gem where she knew the knights wouldn't look. I think...I might just have an idea as to where that might be.)
Barnham:
Sir Blue Knight, I see there's still a faint glimmer of hope in your eyes. Perhaps you can come up with a better answer next time.
Leads back to:
"In that case, perhaps you could tell us all where the magic gem is!"
In Greyerl's possession
Leads to:
"Sir Belduke's premises were thoroughly searched... I don't think anything would have been missed there."
Phoenix:
Sir Belduke's premises were thoroughly searched... I don't think anything would have been missed there. You anticipated that...and that's why you hid it in a blind spot that you knew wouldn't occur to the knights!
Barnham:
A blind spot, you say...? Well, where is it?
Phoenix:
It's...somewhere on Jean Greyerl's person!
Judge:
Wh-what?! It's on the witness?
Greyerl:
............
Barnham:
Don't tell me...the witness has it in their pocket. You're just guessing, aren't you? You think you can just say anything you like...
Greyerl:
By the way, I'm afraid there are no pockets in my clothing.
Phoenix:
(This is the second time I've seen Greyerl today... and both times, I've had a feeling that something wasn't quite right. Maybe it's just me...but it could be related to the whereabouts of the magic gem...)
Judge:
Defence, show us the location of the magic gem. Where do you think this witness hid the magic gem on the day of the crime?
Present cravat
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Witness..."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
It's hidden...somewhere around here!
Barnham:
Barnham:
There you go again... This is not leading anywhere. It's just another meaningless, wild guess. Did you even pause to think before pointing at that spot? Even my frivolous quip that it's in the witness' [sic] pocket was a better suggestion than yours!
Greyerl:
I would just like to remind you... that there are no pockets on my attire.
Phoenix:
Ughhhh! (I was wrong...dang it.)
Luke:
But...Mr Wright... Even if it's hidden somewhere on Greyerl's person... I think it'd be a bit difficult to pinpoint that location now!
Phoenix:
Yeah, it would. In normal circumstances, anyway.
Luke:
Huh?
Phoenix:
But it's not like we don't have anything to go on this time. (Greyerl's outfit has subtly changed since last time... It may be to do with the gem. That change...that must be the answer I'm looking for!)
Leads back to:
"Defence, show us the location of the magic gem."
Phoenix:
Witness... We met for the first time at Sir Belduke's premises. At that time, you had an amethyst attached to your collar.
Judge:
Oh, that's right. Mr Greyerl always wears that gemstone.
Greyerl:
Alchemists believe that amethysts emit positive energy.
Barnham:
Amethysts...are purple...
Phoenix:
But when I saw you in the waiting room this morning... The gemstone you were wearing was green, not purple.
Greyerl:
............
Phoenix:
So my question now is...where has it gone? Where is that amethyst... that you supposedly "always" wear?
Barnham:
Barnham:
Wait...wait just a minute! The witness wears a purple gemstone?
Judge:
Is something amiss, Inquisitor Barnham?
Barnham:
............ When we arrived at the crime scene, the witness came out to meet us... I recall the witness wearing a gemstone... but that gemstone was green.
Judge:
Green? Amethysts aren't green. Although amateurs sometimes mistake prasiolite for amethyst. But that's irrelevant now...
Phoenix:
Witness. You've been trying to pin the blame on the defendant. In order to do that, you replaced the Godoor magic gem with a regular gemstone.
Greyerl:
............
Judge:
We thought the witch who killed Sir Belduke had used the spell Famalia. You knew that if a witch's sceptre with the Famalia and Goldor magic gems attached was discovered at the crime scene... the suspect would be accused of committing both crimes. And that's precisely what happened. The girl captured at the crime scene was accused of slaying both Sir Belduke and Sir Layton.
Phoenix:
That was your plan. You removed the Godoor magic stone from the sceptre and inserted your amethyst in its place. And then...you attached the Godoor gem to your collar!
Barnham:
That's why, when we saw you shortly after the incident, you were wearing a green gemstone. To think...that was in fact a magic gem!
Judge:
Order! Order! ...Witness, is that true?
Greyerl:
............ This amounts to nothing more than conjecture. I do not believe you have any solid proof. However... I have to concede that you have surmised a logical connection between me and the missing magic gem. Consequently...I am prepared to answer your questions.
Phoenix:
...!
Barnham:
Good. I will repeat what I asked you previously. Witness. State your name, profession and finally, your gender.
Greyerl:
...My name is Jean Greyerl. I have been serving the late Master Belduke. As you can see, I wear a butler's outfit... but the truth is as the defence claims. I am...a girl.
Barnham:
A girl... Unbelievable...
Judge:
What?! The butler is a girl?! O-order! Order! Order in the court! Jean Greyerl... Are you declaring to this court that you are, in fact, female?
Greyerl:
Yes.
Judge:
B-but...everyone in town was under the impression that you are a boy...
Greyerl:
............
Eh, did you hear that? The butler's a girl! Doesn't that make him...er, her a maid?I knew there was something suspicious about him... I mean, her!You know why, right? Think about it. All that alchemy...that's mighty suspicious.
Greyerl:
...Just listen to them. Listen to the wild gossip and accusations. Alchemists pursue knowledge of the rules that govern nature. But to the townspeople...alchemy is no different to magic. Had they known I was a girl, they would have taken me for a witch. That's what Master Belduke was worried about. He told me it would be safer to pretend to be a boy.
Phoenix:
In other words... you disclose that you're a female, but deny that you're a witch?
Greyerl:
............ I would have thought that was obvious.
Phoenix:
(She knew that once her gender came into question, she wouldn't have been able to conceal it. That's why she made this public now. It was the most rational choice for her...)
Greyerl:
Inquisitor Barnham, may I ask you one question? Has all the evidence in this "Golden Gentleman" case already been presented?
Barnham:
Why do you ask?
Greyerl:
As it stands, you do not have a single piece of evidence proving that I am a witch. Given the lack of pertinent evidence against me, I would like to be permitted to return to my duties.
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
Hmph... What say you, Inquisitor Barnham?
Barnham:
............ It has been proven that the two gems were swapped. However, it may also have been possible for the accused to have done so.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Maya had no reason to swap the gems!
Barnham:
This is a place of judgement. There is no need for us to understand the reasons behind a criminal's actions.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Barnham:
After all, those whom we judge are other-worldly creatures...they are witches. It is impossible for a human being to understand the reasoning of a witch.
Phoenix:
...!
Espella:
Is there nothing we can do? At this rate, Maya will be...
Phoenix:
(Barnham still thinks Maya is a witch! We've made it this far...and yet, it feels like we're back at stage one.)
Greyerl:
It seems there are no more rational arguments against me. Now, if you will kindly excuse me...
Phoenix:
(I don't have much on Greyerl when it comes to the professor's case... But should I just let her go?)
Wait and see what happens
Phoenix:
(She's so cool-headed and prepared for every question I ask. If I'm too persistent, it may only end up getting worse... I'd better wait a bit and see what happens.)
Espella:
B-but, Mr Wright! We won't have another chance! We need to act now!
Phoenix:
............ You're right! But I wish you'd tell me these things sooner.
Espella:
And I wish you'd realise them sooner...
Phoenix:
(I can't afford to back away now!) Ms Greyerl! Hold on just a moment!
Greyerl:
Oh, is there something else you need to ask me?
Leads to:
"Your testimony is not over yet. There's still something you need to tell us about."
Continue questioning
Phoenix:
Don't leave yet, Ms Greyerl!
Greyerl:
Is there something else you wish to ask me?
Phoenix:
Who cast the spell Goldor? We still haven't found the answer yet!
Greyerl:
I'm afraid I'm not the one to answer that. With all due respect, that's your job.
Barnham:
We have heard all we can from the witnesses. In the current circumstances, you cannot insist that this witness is a witch!
Judge:
That is the opinion of the court, too.
Phoenix:
N-no way!
Luke:
............ Mr Wright. I think...if the professor were with us now, he'd tell us... to view the problem from a different angle.
Phoenix:
From a different angle? Could you be a bit more...specific?
Luke:
............ I think the professor would say... "The one who knows the answer to that question better than anyone else...is you."
Phoenix:
(There's nothing else I can follow up on regarding the professor's case... What else can I do, though?) Well, Luke, thank you for sharing your mentor's words of wisdom with us. I'll figure something out... ...Ms Greyerl.
Leads to:
"Your testimony is not over yet. There's still something you need to tell us about."
Ask about another case
Phoenix:
(There's nothing else I can follow up on regarding the professor's case... So what can I do? There's only one other option...) Ms Greyerl! I have to ask you to remain at the witness stand.
Greyerl:
Is there something else you wish to ask me?
Leads to:
"Your testimony is not over yet. There's still something you need to tell us about."
Phoenix:
Your testimony is not over yet. There's still something you need to tell us about.
Greyerl:
...Mr Wright. I'm afraid I cannot help you. I have told you all I could about this incident.
Phoenix:
And I'm afraid you've got the wrong idea, Ms Greyerl.
Greyerl:
............
Phoenix:
Your Honour. What this witness needs to testify about is not the professor's unfortunate incident... but rather, the incident from three months ago. Namely, Sir Belduke's death. As she was present in the building at the time, working as a live-in butler, she needs to testify about the events of that day!
Judge:
About Sir Belduke's death?!
Barnham:
............
Phoenix:
(The fact that one of the magic gems was swapped leads me to a single conclusion. Both crimes, the murder of Sir Belduke and the transmutation of the professor, were the work of the same witch. The truth behind the alchemist's death may also hold the answer to this case!)
Judge:
Hmph... What is your opinion on this, Inquisitor Barnham?
Barnham:
............ I'll allow you to have your way this time, Sir Blue Knight. The inquisition has no objections.
Greyerl:
Inquisitor Zacharias Barnham... It seems you have lost that unyielding attitude so admired by the townspeople. Here you are now, letting a novice defender lead you by the nose... It is hard to believe you have been known as the "Unwavering Sword of Justice", for your usually cool-headed judgement...
Barnham:
You know little about me, witness. Do you think I care about defending my name? It is this town that I wish to defend.
Greyerl:
............
Barnham:
Sir Belduke's murder is the only case to have remained unsolved for so long. Jean Greyerl, you shall now testify about it!
Judge:
As demanded by both the defence and inquisition... the witness will testify about Sir Belduke's death. Any questions?
Barnham:
No, Milord.
Judge:
I must, however, mention one more thing before we begin. If it cannot be proven that Jean Greyerl is a witch, as claimed by the defence... the court will irrevocably consider Maya Fey to be the witch responsible for both crimes. Is that understood?
Phoenix:
............
Barnham:
You have no choice, Sir Blue Knight. If you don't want the trial to end right now, ready your sword and face the challenge that awaits.
Phoenix:
(But...the opponent is a real witch! It's a gamble that puts Maya's life at stake!)
Maya:
...Nick... ...Nick!
Phoenix:
(M-Maya!)
Maya:
No witch is gonna outwit you in court. You're an ace attorney, after all! So...let's do it!
Phoenix:
............ The defence accepts the conditions. Let's proceed with the trial.
Barnham:
Hmph...
Judge:
Inquisitor Barnham, you may begin.
Barnham:
We shall start with a brief summary of the incident. About three months ago, in the dead of night, Sir Belduke, the alchemist, was murdered. The crime took place in his study, just as with this incident. The room had been locked from the inside. The victim was found still seated in the chair at his desk, so we can assume he was attacked while working. There were very clear strangulation marks visible on his neck.
Judge:
Oh... There's something trickling down from his mouth. Is that blood?
Barnham:
Yes, most likely. The victim probably bit his tongue as he was struggling with his assailant.
Phoenix:
And you said earlier that some white powder was spilled all over the floor, correct?
Barnham:
Yes. Hence, we expected to find the killer's footprints. However, there were none. The killer must have somehow approached the victim without stepping on the floor. After murdering Sir Belduke, the killer left the room without opening the door.
Judge:
Undoubtedly, the crime must have been committed with the use of witchcraft.
Barnham:
The body was discovered the following morning by the butler...Ms Greyerl.
Phoenix:
(The body was found by Greyerl, huh...)
Judge:
Thank you, Inquisitor Barnham. The Court Illustrator's sketches will be added to the evidence.
Crime Scene Sketches added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Now, witness. Begin your testimony. Tell us about the events spanning the night of the crime, from the evening beforehand until you discovered the body.
Witness Testimony
- The Night of the Crime -
Greyerl:
At around 1 o'clock at night, I excused myself and left Master Belduke in his study.
When I called him for breakfast in the morning, he did not respond. The door to his study was locked.
A neighbour had come for a visit just then, so we forced the door open together.
All the potions and other concoctions from the study have been confiscated. I wonder if they're being properly stored...
Phoenix:
"Potions and concoctions" were confiscated?
Barnham:
The victim was an alchemist, after all. We were hoping the items confiscated from his study could provide some clues. Besides, such things must not fall into the wrong hands. It may not be standard practice, but it was deemed necessary. The confiscated goods are stored in our secret vault. The only person with access to them is the High Inquisitor, Lady Darklaw.
Greyerl:
It has caused me great difficulty, as I have not been able to put Master's research materials in order as a result.
Barnham:
The confiscated items shall be returned as soon as Sir Belduke's murder is resolved.
Greyerl:
............ I shall be looking forward to that.
Judge:
Defence, you may begin the interrogation!

At around 1 o'clock at night, I excused myself and left Master Belduke in his study.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So you last saw him alive at 1am, is that correct?
Greyerl:
...Yes. Master had a habit of conducting his experiments at night, so it was the usual time for me to finish my work.
Phoenix:
Weren't you helping him with those experiments?
Greyerl:
He would sometimes have some errands for me, but alchemists generally keep their experiments a secret. That's why I would always excuse myself at that time, unless Master had some other tasks for me.
Barnham:
And that night there was no more work for you?
Greyerl:
...That's correct. I wished Master a good night as I shut the door behind me and then heard him lock the key. There was nothing unusual about him. At least, nothing I noticed.
Greyerl:
When I called him for breakfast in the morning, he did not respond. The door to his study was locked.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
And what time was that?
Greyerl:
Master would always take his breakfast at 9am, so it was around that time.
Barnham:
So you didn't have the key to Sir Belduke's study...is that correct?
Greyerl:
Yes. There is only one key to that room and Master always kept it with him. Master's research was a...very delicate matter, you see. We had to take strict measures to prevent outsiders from entering that room. Occasionally, delinquents would try to make off with one or other of Master's medicaments.
Phoenix:
(Thieves stealing from an alchemist? I can't tell if that's incredibly brave or incredibly stupid... Probably the latter.)
Greyerl:
That's why the door to that room is made from thick oak wood. I wouldn't have been able to force the door open on my own.
Phoenix:
(She couldn't have entered the room before that, then...)
Greyerl:
A neighbour had come for a visit just then, so we forced the door open together.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Wait, you mean you broke the door?
Barnham:
The only key to that room was in Sir Belduke's pocket. The only way to enter the study was to break the door open.
Phoenix:
And you managed that with the help of a neighbour who came to visit?
Greyerl:
Yes. It wasn't a social visit, mind. He came as a patient.
Phoenix:
A patient? Can you tell me more about him?
Barnham:
Barnham:
The victim's neighbour is irrelevant. He has nothing to do with this case!
Phoenix:
Ugh, I think you're pushing it this time... A witness is hardly irrelevant!
Barnham:
Grrrr...ngh.
Phoenix:
(What's got him so shaken? He looks as if he just had a rush of blood to the head.)
Greyerl:
Master Belduke had been making very potent medicines, among other things. We would get people coming from the town at all hours of the day or night asking for them. And yet, in return for all the help Master offered, people would gossip about him dabbling in witchcraft...
Phoenix:
Err... So you broke the door together with a neighbour?
Greyerl:
Yes. When I explained the situation to him, he brought over an axe. Then he proceeded to attack the door with great force, smashing it into splinters.
Phoenix:
...I see. By the way, about that neighbour... Who was th-

Phoenix:
Those items were confiscated three months ago... You still haven't got them back?
Greyerl:
No. Not a single thing. Even though many of those were personal items with no relevance to the crime.
Phoenix:
(Now that I think about it, that room did look pretty empty.)
Barnham:
As I said... the victim was an alchemist and among his possessions were some very dangerous concoctions. But he did produce medicines to aid sick townspeople as well, to give him his due.
Greyerl:
Indeed. Alchemy is highly beneficial to the townspeople, even if they fail to notice it.
Barnham:
It may be beneficial, but it also inspires fear. People fear what they do not understand. At any rate, I cannot return the items to you until Sir Belduke's case is solved. That is what High Inquisitor Darklaw has decided.
Phoenix:
And the confiscated goods are being kept in a secret vault by the Knights of the Inquisition?

Miss Greyerl had plenty of respect for Sir Belduke, you know... I can't believe she would have killed him. I'm sure you'll find the truth... It's what you always do!

Hm? Oh, that's okay. What is it?

Um, yeah. How can I put it...? It's pretty obviously contradictory.
Luke:
He was so keen to testify, maybe we should give him some attention and point those contradictions out!
Espella:
What a good idea, Luke!
Phoenix:
There's something you don't seem to understand here, Mr Emeer. The Famalia gem in this witch's sceptre is a fake. The gem is useless.
Barnham:
Just like this buffoon's testimony.
Emeer:
Huh?

Therefore, your testimony doesn't hold water.

Judge:
Now that has been dealt with... Inquisitor Barnham. This witch's sceptre was not discovered at the crime scene when Sir Belduke was murdered, is that correct?
Barnham:
Indeed. We deduced that Famalia must have been used, however.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But, that Famalia magic gem was a fake. That much has been demonstrated today! What's more, as we've learned from Cracker the parrot's testimony... the witch used the spell Godoor! The fact that there's a green wall at the crime scene corroborates that!
Barnham:
Barnham:
That wall may well not have been painted green three months ago! And besides...no one could have passed through a portal so small!
Judge:
Hmph... To be honest, I've started wondering. Were Sir Layton's and Sir Belduke's murders... actually committed by the same witch?
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Your Honour, I'd like to remind you that was the inquisition's claim!
Barnham:
...!
Phoenix:
(He's right, though... It's got to be the same culprit in both cases!) And...at the very least... it's possible that the witch used the spell Godoor to commit Sir Belduke's murder.

Wh-what!

In that case, I will ask the defence to show us proof. Do you have proof that the witch could have used Godoor to kill Sir Belduke?

Aren't those... the Court Illustrator's sketches?

As you can see from this sketch, the victim was seated at his desk when he was murdered. And what can you see right behind the victim?
Barnham:
...A small landscape painting...
Phoenix:
Thank you, Inquisitor. But there's one more point of note... Look closely at the painting. Do you notice...anything behind it?
Judge:
Oh...oh! I see it! The wall behind it had already been painted green! Which means the witch could have used the portal spell there three months ago!
Barnham:
Barnham:
One moment, Milord! Consider how small that portal would've been! Could a witch have passed through it? I think not!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Of course, the witch would not be able to go right through it. However... if you look at the distance between the portal and the victim, you'll notice... that the victim, Sir Belduke, was sitting just an arm's length from where the portal would have been!
Barnham:
...!
Phoenix:
The witch did not have to enter the room at all! All she had to do was reach through with her arms in order to strangle Sir Belduke, who was sitting right under the painting!

Order! Inquisitor Barnham, what say you to that?
Barnham:
A fascinating theory, Sir Blue Knight. But there is a notable contradiction within it.
Phoenix:
Where would that be?
Barnham:
Tell me, why do you think we concluded that Famalia had to have been used? We had a certain reason for it, of course.
Judge:
And...what was that reason, exactly?
Barnham:
The crime scene had been tampered with.
Phoenix:
How so?
Barnham:
Imagine the circumstances of Sir Belduke's death, and it should become obvious, even to you. The victim was choked to death. And yet there were no signs of a struggle. Highly improbable, don't you think?
Phoenix:
What are you getting at?
Barnham:
Think about it. Can you imagine anyone just sitting back and letting themselves be strangled? Clearly there should be evidence of a struggle! And since we haven't found any, that must mean the killer erased all traces of a fight from the crime scene.
Judge:
I-indeed! That would be the logical conclusion!
Barnham:
Now, surely it would be impossible to do any such thing, had the witch only reached inside through a portal. In order to cover up the evidence she left behind, the witch had to have used a familiar. Without doing so, there would have been no point in her using the spell Godoor!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl could have done it... She might have been able to tamper with the crime scene.
Barnham:
What are you talking about?
Phoenix:
The morning of the crime... from the time Ms Greyerl and that guy entered the study... until the arrival of the Knights of the Inquisition... There was a window of time in which she had the opportunity to do so. We need to look into what happened in that window!
Judge:
It seems we may be in need of another testimony. Witnesses, testify about what happened in the time between the body being found and the Knights of the Inquisition arriving.
Emeer:
Sure thing! Ask me aaanything! I'll tell ya all ya need to know!
Birdly:
♪Oh, glorious Emeer! Tell us more! Maybe you won't be laughed at as before!♪
Phoenix:
(Only two people accessed the crime scene in that time. Greyerl and Emeer. Believe it or not, Emeer is the key witness in this case!)
Witness Testimony
- After Discovering the Body -
Emeer:
I broke down th' door an' saw th' alchemist slumped in 'is chair. Gave me a JOLT!
Th' butler hurried t'call th' Knights of th' Inquisition... He never entered th' study.
Whaddid I do then... Ah, yeah! I was asked t'keep an EYE on things, so I wen' in t'have a bit of a look at everythin'...
All that made me pretty drowsy, so I wen' an' took-a-little NAP on th' couch.
Phoenix:
Wait, what? Mr Emeer... You said the butler didn't enter the crime scene?
Emeer:
Yup. He never set foot in there! The moment he saw Belduke, he told me to stand guard till the Knights of the Inquisition arrived. And then, off he went... "What a resourceful apprentice that alchemist has," I thought to meself.
Barnham:
I almost feel sorry for you, Sir Blue Knight. After all, your suspect couldn't have tampered with the crime scene.
Phoenix:
............ (That...can't be true!)
Judge:
Defence, please proceed with the interrogation!
Phoenix:
...Yes, Your Honour!
Cross Examination
- After Discovering the Body -
Emeer:
I broke down th' door an' saw th' alchemist slumped in 'is chair. Gave me a JOLT!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Before you smashed the door... did you check that it was really locked?
Emeer:
'Course I did! We tried to get it open without resorting to brute force, but it wouldn't budge. So I went to fetch me lovely li'l axe.
Birdly:
♪His wooden enemy stood tall and still, Yet Emeer sprang forth - it was overkill!♪
Greyerl:
Heh... Did you think I lied about the door being locked?
Phoenix:
No, no, of course not. (Boy, she's so sharp she might cut herself. Or me...most likely me.)
Emeer:
So then I went inside. The alchemist was slumped in his chair.
Barnham:
While we're at it, allow me to confirm something. When you entered the room... did the victim look the way he does in this sketch?
Emeer:
Yep, that's it! Spot on! Nicely drawn, too! Y'know, at first I didn't know if he was really dead. He looked like he just passed out or somethin', tired from his research. That apprentice of his is real good. To be able to tell at a single glance that the alchemist was done for!
Question Jean Greyerl
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl... May I ask you something?
Greyerl:
Yes, what is it?
Phoenix:
What do you think about Mr Emeer's testimony?
Greyerl:
There's nothing amiss. However, Mr Wright... I can tell what you are thinking.
Phoenix:
You...can? Well, let's see if you're right.
Greyerl:
When he entered the room, Mr Emeer didn't notice that Master Belduke was dead. On the other hand, I ran straight away to call the Knights of the Inquisition. And so... you suspect that I knew beforehand that Master was dead. That's what you're thinking. Your face is like an open book.
Phoenix:
............ But, isn't that what actually happened?
Greyerl:
No. I knew something was wrong because Master had very fine manners and would never sleep in his chair. When I saw him like that, I was struck with a very bad realisation. I felt certain that something terrible had happened.
Judge:
Hmph. I have heard about you... The word is that you're very collected and perceptive. It would seem to be the case.
Phoenix:
(It would be more appropriate to call her calculating.)
Greyerl:
............
Emeer:
Somehow I feel like you're not payin' me enough attention here.
Barnham:
That matters not, witness. Let us proceed with the cross-examination.
Emeer:
Matters not, eh? No need to be so rude about it...
Leads back to cross-examination
Emeer:
Th' butler hurried t'call th' Knights of th' Inquisition... He never entered th' study.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Are you sure the butler didn't enter the crime scene?
Emeer:
Yeah! Like I said, he didn't set foot in that room. I went in and sorta didn't know what to do, but the butler sussed out the situation in the blink of an eye. He told me to stand guard...an' then he ran out.
Phoenix:
She went to call the Knights of the Inquisition, is that correct?
Greyerl:
That's correct. I went to the nearby garrison.
Barnham:
We have the records of when the crime was reported. They match the witness' [sic] testimony.
Greyerl:
I returned to Master Belduke's house with two knights. They began an investigation immediately, taking away Master's research materials and concoctions... In the end, I wasn't able to enter that room that day.
Barnham:
There can be no doubt about it. As he...she is the alchemist's apprentice, she was under close observation following the incident.
Greyerl:
I wasn't aware of that.
Phoenix:
(So, in the end... she didn't have access to the crime scene at all on that day, huh.) By the way, what were you doing at that time?
Emeer:
Huh? Wha? Me?
Emeer:
Whaddid I do then... Ah, yeah! I was asked t'keep an EYE on things, so I wen' in t'have a bit of a look at everythin'...
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
What were you having a look at?
Emeer:
Ah, well, I was asked to take care of the crime scene, wasn't I? So I had to, like, make sure everythin' was in order. I mean, y'know... It's not like I went wild with excitement after bein' left in a real alchemist's room, full of mysterious stuff!
Phoenix:
(I'm sure you didn't, Mr Sticky Fingers...)
Emeer:
Uhm, an' besides...
Phoenix:
Besides...?
Emeer:
She asked me to look for somethin', so I was doin' that too. Can't refuse a request from a lady, amiright?
Question Jean Greyerl
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl... You look lost in thought.
Greyerl:
............ Oh...were you talking to me?
Phoenix:
(Even she can be caught off guard...if I choose the right moment.) You have been listening to Mr Emeer's testimony, haven't you?
Greyerl:
Yes. I have.
Phoenix:
He was asked to look for something. It was you who asked him, I assume. What did you tell him to look for?
Greyerl:
............ I think you're mistaken. I don't remember making any request of that sort.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Emeer:
Oi, Bluey! Were you even listening to what I said? It was a lady that asked me. The butler is a guy, you numbskull! Hey...what's up? Why's everyone lookin' at me like that?
Phoenix:
Quite a while ago, we learned... that the butler, Jean Greyerl, is actually female.
Emeer:
Wha...
Phoenix:
That's why, when you said a lady asked you to search for something, we assumed it was Ms Greyerl.
Emeer:
Wha... Wha...
Birdly:
♪Daydreaming, listening, but not hearing. That look of shock is almost endearing♪
Emeer:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat the?! Why didn't anyone tell me before! [sic]
Barnham:
Do you require a personal notification? You should have been listening to the trial!
Judge:
Knights of the Court, squabbling with a witness is most unseemly. What I would like to know now is this: who was the lady that made the request of Emeer?
Emeer:
Uhm... Oh, yeah. That was, actually, Miss...
???:
Siiiiiiiirrr!
???* (Lettie Mailer):
I think, uhm...he's absolutely certainly talking about me!
Judge:
Oh...and you are...?
Mailer:
Oh, I'm Lettie. Hang on a minute, I'll get down there post-haste!
Judge:
But...Miss Lettie, who are you, precisely?
Mailer:
Me? Who am I? I'm Lettie Mailer. I'm the courier.
Phoenix:
(The courier?)
Espella:
A courier is a person who collects and delivers letters. Or packages.
Phoenix:
I know... Thanks anyway, Espella. (I wish she'd stop misreading my mind...)
Barnham:
Hold on, Ms Mailer. Do you mean it was you who irresponsibly made such a request to that troublemaker?
Mailer:
Me? Maybe. Yes. I guess so. I asked him to help me find something.
Barnham:
Outrageous! Why was I not informed of this?!
Mailer:
Hmm. I guess no one told you...maybe because you didn't ask?
Barnham:
Grrrrrrr... Nghhhh...
Judge:
It seems we will need to ask you to testify, Miss Mailer. Explain to us how you were involved in this case.
Mailer:
Frankly, I wouldn't say I was "involved" in anything. Hmm...now I'm in a tight spot. I bet it's because that guy said something weird about me.
Emeer:
Har har har har har! Ease up on me, lady. Like the saying goes... "If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' you with me". Beats bein' in a pickle all on yer own, eh? *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp*
Judge:
Now then, Miss Lettie Mailer... Testify about that day.
Mailer:
Siiiiiiiirrr!
Phoenix:
............ (That voice could make windows shatter.)

Birdly:
♪Emeer's lesser-known gentlemanly side Had me surprised, if I may so confide!♪
Phoenix:

Barnham:
What's that? This is news to me. What were you asked to look for? Enlighten us, witness!
Emeer:
What was it, now... Hmm... Y'know, I can't remember.
Phoenix:
(Well, maybe if you didn't drink so much...)
Emeer:
Does it matter? In the end, whatever it was, I never found it. I remember that.
Press (after adding fifth statement)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So in the end, it was Ms Mailer who asked you to do that?
Emeer:
Yep! Who else? I never had the faintest idea that butler was a girl, y'see.
Greyerl:
I apologise for having kept it secret until now.
Emeer:
Oh, no, no! Don't you worry about it, sweetheart. I'm very, uhm, understandin'. But, how to put it... Now that I know... It changes everythin', eh? It's a tad embarrasin' to think I treated ya like a chap. From now on...I'll show ya me gentler side!

Oh, I assure you, there's no need to treat me any differently now. I'm still the same person, after all.

Emeer:
Well, anyway... If you wanna know what I was lookin' for, ya'd better ask the courier herself! At any rate, I didn't find it in the end... whatever it was.
Emeer:
All that made me pretty drowsy, so I wen' an' took-a-little NAP on th' couch.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You...took a nap? In a room where a man had been murdered...with the body still in there?
Emeer:
Why so surprised, Bluey? It was 9am... I'm usually still half asleep at that hour. I s'pose maybe all the merrymaking the night before added to that as well...
Birdly:
♪An infamous celebrity known to all inns, Emeer makes merry like a young prince♪
Emeer:
So yeah, I was kinda overcome with drowsiness. There was nothing else I could do but go to sleep, right?
Barnham:
When the butler returned, accompanied by the two knights... he was supposedly sleeping noisily on the victim's couch.
Phoenix:
You mean, he was snoring?
Barnham:
Apparently, he was grinding his teeth.
Phoenix:
(Urgh... I shouldn't have asked...)
Luke:
But then, anyone could've tampered with the crime scene when Mr Emeer was asleep, right?
Phoenix:
...! Good catch, Luke.
Emeer:
Anyway, I'd barely caught a wink of sleep when those knights arrived... And me teeth-grindin' has sort of a paralysin' effect on people, so I've been told. So even if someone had come in, I don't think they'd've been able to do much.
Phoenix:
...Right.
Mailer:
Sir Belduke said he'd have a letter to send. So I came by to pick it up.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You mean you came to pick up a letter from Sir Belduke?
Mailer:
Yes! I was told. By Sir Belduke. That it'd be ready in the morning. What's more, he said it was extremely important. I felt a sense of duty surging within me!
Question Jean Greyerl
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl, I have a question.
Greyerl:
Yes, what is it?
Phoenix:
Did anything catch your attention during Ms Mailer's statement?
Greyerl:
Nothing in particular. And at any rate, to begin with...I was not aware of the fact that the courier visited us that day.
Mailer:
Ah! That's right. You weren't there when I arrived. And once I found the letter, I left immediately.
Barnham:
Did you know about this letter, witness?
Greyerl:
............ I would never pry into Master's personal matters, such as his correspondence.
Phoenix:
............
Barnham:
Well, that should conclude the testimony.
Leads back to cross-examination
Barnham:
And so, you visited Sir Belduke's dwelling... the morning after he was murdered.
Mailer:
I got a start when I arrived! The door was smashed in, and that man was walking around with an axe, rummaging about. As for Sir Belduke, he was slumped in his chair, and the butler was nowhere to be found. "That brute's gone too far," I thought to myself! You can see why, right?
Phoenix:
Of course.
Barnham:
Naturally.
Judge:
In your place, I'd have thought so myself!
Emeer:
That's mean...
Mailer:
Anyway, I spoke with him and he told me what happened. So that's when I asked him to help me.
Phoenix:
You asked him to look for something?
Mailer:
Yes! The letter. I asked him to search for the letter. But in the end, the guy passed out on the couch. I found the letter myself. Then I delivered it.
Phoenix:
You actually delivered the letter? (That's commitment, all right...)
Barnham:
About that letter... Who, in the name of the Noble Author, was it addressed to?
Mailer:
Siiiiiiiirrr! I can't tell you that. Sorry. Couriers can't disclose that sort of info.
Judge:
Couriers have a confidentiality obligation. No one wants to have the addressees of their letters made public, after all.
Barnham:
I have personally never sent a letter that I would need to keep secret from the public.
Judge:
............ D-don't look at me like that! I was talking about public opinion on the matter, not my own!
Phoenix:
(Belduke was about to send an important letter when he was killed... That letter... Hmm... It kind of rings a bell.)
Nope, no idea
Phoenix:
............ (Nah, I'm reading too much into it. If I show them a random piece of evidence, they're likely to slice me and dice me.)
Espella:
Is something wrong? You've been strangely quiet, Mr Wright.
Luke:
If there's something you want to say, I think you ought to just say it. If a trial is anything like a puzzle, sometimes the best thing is to give it a go first and see what happens!
Phoenix:
(Now a kid's lecturing me on how to be a good attorney. Ugh...)
Barnham:
Well, that should conclude the testimony.
Leads back to cross-examination
Present evidence
Phoenix:
(It's just a hunch...and it might not have anything to do with this case, but I need to make sure... I need to know more about Belduke's letter.) Witness...
Mailer:
Huh? Me? What's up?
Phoenix:
The letter Sir Belduke asked you to deliver on that day... Was it...
Present Blank Letter
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The letter you found that morning..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
N-no, it's nothing.
Mailer:
Huh? But. Just now. You sounded quite determined for a second there!
Phoenix:
Just...forget about it, please.
Barnham:
Barnham:
It takes considerable determination to point the sword of justice at a person. Should you miss and stumble...your enemy will bury his sword into your back!
Phoenix:
(Ughh...I felt a cold chill run down my spine just now...)
Barnham:
Well, that should conclude the testimony.
Leads back to cross-examination
Present Blank Letter
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The letter you found that morning..."
Before adding fifth statement
Phoenix:
(Greyerl didn't set foot in the study...)
Espella:
But then, that would mean... it wasn't feasible for her to have tampered with the evidence at the crime scene.
Luke:
If that's the case, I guess we'd better look at other possibilities...right, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Yeah... Unfortunately it all hinges on Emeer's testimony... (But who knows what that guy might say next? I'd better treat him with extra care... Cross-examining him is like walking through a field of landmines... He just might be more dangerous than Barnham!)
Espella:
Let's gently press him into giving us some more information!
Phoenix:
(I'll be as gentle as a lamb to make sure I don't get his goat.)
After adding fifth statement
Phoenix:
(So now we know there was a third witness.)
Espella:
But Miss Mailer only came to pick up a letter. Hmm. That doesn't help us much, does it?
Luke:
Well...perhaps there's more to it than meets the eye.
Phoenix:
A letter, huh? (Belduke was about to send a letter to someone before he was killed... It may not be relevant to this case, but something about that is bothering me. Maybe it's worth asking Lettie about it.)
Phoenix:
The letter you found that morning... Was it, by any chance, this one here?
Mailer:
Ah! Yes! That's the one! But wait! How did you get it? You're a piece of work all right!
Barnham:
Barnham:
Hold it! Sir Blue Knight. How did you come by that letter?
Phoenix:
It just sort of...fell into my lap, so to speak. (It was the professor who found it, but he doesn't need to know that...)
Judge:
Defender! Just what in the world...are the contents of that letter?
Phoenix:
Well... The letter's blank.
Judge:
What?
Barnham:
All this fuss over a blank letter?
Phoenix:
As you can see, there are some sheets of parchment inside the envelope.
Judge:
Indeed...and there's not a trace of ink on them! What is the meaning of this?
Barnham:
Don't forget that Sir Belduke was an alchemist. He may have used some kind of invisible ink to write that letter.
Judge:
Hmph... Indeed. That would make sense.
Mailer:
Siiiiiiiirrr! About that. It doesn't make sense to me.
Barnham:
Wh-what...?
Phoenix:
Ms Mailer?
Mailer:
The thing is... when I saw that letter, all the pages were full of writing. So, you know.
Barnham:
Barnham:
Hold it, witness. You...saw the contents of Sir Belduke's letter?
Mailer:
Uhm, I didn't read it. It's just that, you see...
Judge:
Witness, this is an important matter. You will need to testify about it. Tell us what you know about this letter!
Witness Testimony
- Sir Belduke's Letter -
Mailer:
That night... Probably about 1am. I made a delivery to Sir Belduke.
He was writing a letter at the time. "It'll be ready soon, so come pick it up tomorrow morning." That's what he said.
I left his study and wished the butler a good night. Then I went home.
I went there again the next morning, as promised. Sir Belduke was... Well anyway, I looked for the letter.
Then that guy went out like a light on the couch. I got a little scared. So I left as soon as I found the letter.
Judge:
Hmph... I see, I see. So you witnessed the victim write the letter?
Mailer:
Uhm... I wouldn't say "witnessed". That sounds so legal. The sheets of parchment were on his desk, though. I saw that. And they were covered in writing, margin to margin.
Barnham:
But...you don't know what the letter was about?
Mailer:
Siiiiiiiirrr! Telling you would be a breach of our privacy policy! I can't reveal its contents. Or who it was addressed to!
Judge:
Oh, of course. I understand.
Mailer:
Frankly, I didn't get close enough. To Sir Belduke's desk, I mean. So I couldn't make out what he was writing.
Judge:
In any case, where did you find the letter the morning after the victim was found dead?
Mailer:
Uhm... On a shelf. Next to his desk. In a small letterbox. Ah, yes! Right there. Next to his head. I was a teeny little bit scared, though. Coming so close to a dead man.
Phoenix:
(So that's where she took the letter from... It was right next to the corpse, huh.)
Judge:
Now that the circumstances are clear, we shall proceed to the cross-examination!
Cross Examination
- Sir Belduke's Letter -
Mailer:
That night... Probably about 1am. I made a delivery to Sir Belduke.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That's pretty late to be making a delivery.
Mailer:
Look, he's an alchemist. He gets loads of strange packages. That's why. He'd often order various implements from the glass craftsman. Or have someone gather wild herbs for him. He usually carried out his experiments at night. So, yeah. He often needed items delivered in the middle of the night.
Phoenix:
Did Sir Belduke seem at all different than normal when you saw him that night?
Mailer:
Different? Let me think. Actually, yes.
Phoenix:
...!
Mailer:
I think...it was about three days before. Before Sir Belduke's death, I mean. That lightning strike...
Question Jean Greyerl
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Ms Greyerl.
Greyerl:
Oh... What... What is it?
Phoenix:
Did anything in Ms Mailer's statement catch your attention?
Greyerl:
............ Well...just the lightning strike. Master Belduke did certainly change following that event. I wonder why it affected him so much...
Phoenix:
(An alchemist and the sudden appearance of an old bell tower... Could there be some sort of a connection between them?)
Greyerl:
............
Phoenix:
(Anyway, it looks like Greyerl is as much in the dark about this as I am.)
Barnham:
By the way... that strange lightning strike was not the result of witchcraft.
Judge:
Hmph. I see. Well then, let us carry on.
Leads back to cross-examination
Barnham:
Lightning strike? Ah, yes.
The sky was clear, and then there was a sudden flash of lightning. Out of nowhere, an old bell tower appeared, in flames.
Judge:
Ah, yes. That certainly was an unusual event.
Phoenix:
(They all seem so calm about it. A tower suddenly materialising in the town is more than just an "unusual event", right...?)
Mailer:
I had a delivery for Sir Belduke that evening, too. He looked terrified that night. As if he was scared of something.
Phoenix:
What could he have been afraid of? (Was it because of the lightning strike?)
Mailer:
I was wondering about it too... But, well. Then that incident happened.
Phoenix:
(I guess he died before she could find out any more...)
Barnham:
I suggest we get back to discussing the night of the crime. Witness, you arrived at Sir Belduke's residence. What happened then?
Mailer:
He was writing a letter at the time. "It'll be ready soon, so come pick it up tomorrow morning." That's what he said.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You saw the letter he was writing?
Mailer:
Uhm. I told you before. There were sheets of parchment with writing on them on his desk. I had a very quick look. There were so many sheets. The letter must've been very long.
Barnham:
Then how can you explain the letter being blank now?
Mailer:
Siiiiiiiirrr! That's just it. That's what I'd like to know as well!
Phoenix:
(I wish I had some ear plugs...)
Mailer:
Sir Belduke... He was holding a pen when I arrived with the delivery. Se he was in the middle of writing. And also...he told me to pick up the letter next morning.
Barnham:
And then you left his study.
Mailer:
I left his study and wished the butler a good night. Then I went home.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
W-wait a minute! When you say the butler, you mean...
Mailer:
Mr...um, Miss Greyerl, of course. She was in the corridor, carrying a tray. You know... Actually, I quite liked the butler. Is it really true she's a girl? It's a bit...disappointing. To me, at least.
Question Jean Greyerl
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl... I'd like to ask you something.
Greyerl:
Oh... Certainly. What is it?
Phoenix:
You stated previously... that you excused yourself and left Sir Belduke's study shortly after 1am.
Greyerl:
Yes, that is correct.
Phoenix:
However, according to Ms Mailer's testimony... the two of you came across each other while you were waiting outside that room.
Greyerl:
............
Phoenix:
Why didn't you mention that until now?
Greyerl:
That... That's because... ............ I apologise. I'm afraid I completely forgot to mention it.
Barnham:
You forgot?
Greyerl:
Miss Mailer very often comes with deliveries during the night. I did see her that night as well. But I didn't think much of it, as it's nothing unusual. I had no reason to hide that from you. Please forgive me for the confusion.
Barnham:
............
Judge:
Hmph. Well, that kind of thing can happen. Human memory is in no way perfect. I don't imagine there's a problem here, is there?
Phoenix:
...On the contrary, Your Honour. There's one more thing Ms Greyerl forgot to mention.
Greyerl:
...!
Judge:
Wh-what is it?
Phoenix:
I'd like you to recall what Ms Mailer said about having met Ms Greyerl that night.
Mailer:
Mr...um, Miss Greyerl, of course. She was in the corridor, carrying a tray.
Phoenix:
Well, Ms Greyerl. Apparently you were carrying a tray at the time... What do you have to say about that?
Greyerl:
............
Judge:
Jean Greyerl, I believe you should add that to your testimony.
Greyerl:
...As you wish, Milord.
Phoenix:
(It's unlikely she really forgot about it... The fact she tried to hide it must mean something!)
Changes statement from "I left his study and wished the butler a good night. Then I went home." to "Miss Mailer left just as I was bringing Master his usual drink."
Greyerl:
Oh, I... I'm sorry I was unable to meet your expectations.
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure I want to know about her "expectations".)
Greyerl:
In any case, Miss Mailer did visit us that night. She came to deliver a package to Master Belduke. She delivered it to Master personally. There were always many things to which I was not privy.
Mailer:
Right. And I saw you that night. When I was leaving. I almost walked into you.
Greyerl:
Yes, it's just as you say. I was about to wish Master Belduke a good night.
Phoenix:
(Greyerl looks a lot more confident now... But she seemed so shaken for a moment earlier. I wonder what that was about... Maybe I missed the right moment.)
Judge:
Hmph. Witnesses, continue with your testimonies.
Greyerl:
Miss Mailer left just as I was bringing Master his usual drink.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
What do you mean by "usual drink"?
Greyerl:
When Master's experiments continued into late hours, he would always have some juice to ward off sleepiness.
Phoenix:
What kind of juice?
Greyerl:
Tomato juice. He'd have one bottle every night. It was my daily routine to bring it to him before withdrawing to my room for the night.
Question Emeer Punchenbaug
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me...mister.
Emeer:
............
Phoenix:
Mister!
Emeer:
Bwahhhhh! I...I know nothin' about it! Nothin'! Nothin' at all!
Phoenix:

Barnham:

Judge:
............
Barnham:
Witness... What have you done this time?
Emeer:
Don't... Don't give me that scary look! Inquisitor Barnham! I... I... It was only...just a little bit! Seriously. Hardly anythin' at all!
Phoenix:
Uhm... What are you talking about?
Emeer:
Huh? Wh-whaddya think I'm talkin' about? The j-juice. The tomato juice, of course!
Judge:
The...tomato juice...?
Barnham:
Oh, you didn't... Surely even you wouldn't!
Emeer:
Well, like I told ya before... I think I sorta overdid it a bit the previous night... When I woke up, me head was poundin'. That's why I went to see the alchemist. But you know what happened. And when I was left alone in the alchemist's study... it kinda caught me eye. The bottle, I mean.
Barnham:
The tomato juice...
Emeer:
I thought it might make the headache go away, y'know...
Judge:
So you...you drank it? The juice found at the crime scene?!
Emeer:
Well, why shouldn't I? It's a drink, ain't it? What else do you do with a drink? You drink it, right?!
Judge:
And can you tell us where that bottle is now?
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it...I don't remember seeing it at the crime scene.)
Greyerl:
It has been confiscated.
Phoenix:
Confiscated?
Greyerl:
As I mentioned previously... The Occult Crime Analysts confiscated all of Master's personal belongings from the crime scene.
Judge:
Is that so? Well, I believe we should take note of that bottle and add it to the Court Record.
Tomato Juice Bottle added to the Court Record.
Emeer:
Yeah, so, there I was, havin' a bit of juice, when that girl came round.
Mailer:
Siiiiiiiirrr!
Emeer:
To tell ya the truth... I don't quite remember what happened after that...
Phoenix:
(That's when he passed out, huh.)
Leads back to cross-examination
Judge:
So, you brought him tomato juice that night too?
Greyerl:
Yes. I did. Master Belduke thanked me, as always, and then I left him.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl, I have to ask you again... Why have you kept this information from the court until now?
Greyerl:
............ Please accept my sincere apologies. It was such an obvious part of my daily routine that it didn't even occur to me to mention it.
Phoenix:
You want us to believe that you simply forgot to tell us?
Greyerl:
............
Barnham:
That would match the evidence found at the crime scene. I do remember seeing an uncorked bottle of tomato juice there.
Luke:
Mr Wright! Please take a look at this! It's here in the Court Illustrator's sketch too.
Phoenix:
(So it is. That Court Illustrator certainly does pay attention to the details...)
Barnham:
Then, that would mean... the red liquid trickling down from the victim's mouth is not, in fact, blood. It is tomato juice. I think we can safely make that assumption.
Greyerl:
Poor Master...
Press (after questioning Emeer Punchenbaug correctly)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
What do you mean by "usual drink"?
Greyerl:
When Master's experiments continued into late hours, he would always have some juice to ward off sleepiness.
Barnham:
You mean this tomato juice, do you not?
Greyerl:
That is correct. I would go to the market every morning to pick up some freshly squeezed juice. He'd have one bottle every night. It was my daily routine to bring it to him before withdrawing to my room for the night.
Barnham:
That would be the same juice you drank at the crime scene, stealing from a dead man, would it not?
Emeer:
Aww, come on! I just took a sip. Well, maybe a bit more than a sip...but I didn't drink it all! I thought you guys might get thirsty durin' the investigation. See, I'm a pretty nice guy sometimes, y'know.
Birdly:
♪How delightful! Leftover, warm juice! Kind Emeer, you deserve no abuse♪
Barnham:
No one except you would drink that!
Phoenix:
(Greyerl didn't want us to know about that juice... But why would she choose to hide it? There's got to be a reason...)
Judge:
Witnesses, continue your testimonies.
Mailer:
Siiiiiiiirrr!
Phoenix:
............
Mailer:
I went there again the next morning, as promised. Sir Belduke was... Well anyway, I looked for the letter.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You took the letter from the crime scene?
Mailer:
Uhm, that's right. I took it. From the crime scene.
Barnham:
Barnham:
Do you not realise that pinching evidence from a crime scene is itself a crime worthy of severe punishment?!
Mailer:
Siiiiiiiirrr! Uhm. Well, it might be a crime, sure... But just look at the witch's defender. He's got to defend a witch...using any dirty tricks at his disposal!
Phoenix:
Dirty tricks? Wh-what dirty tricks...?
Mailer:
It's the same for me, you know? I'm a courier. So come rain or shine, I've got to deliver. Where there's mail, there's Mailer!
Emeer:
I was so inspired by the young lady's spirit that I kinda just had to help.
Birdly:
♪Although inspired by her dedication, He betrayed a lack of concentration♪
Greyerl:
It is entirely my fault that it came to that. Had I only been at the residence then...
Barnham:
Ughhh... Blarg.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. Greyerl was out notifying the knights at the time...)
Mailer:
Then that guy went out like a light on the couch. I got a little scared. So I left as soon as I found the letter.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
He "went out like a light"?
Mailer:
He was helping me look for the letter. And then it happened. Out of the blue. He just passed out. The rascal. He collapsed. And his eyes rolled back. He wouldn't move.
Phoenix:
It almost sounds like he died...
Mailer:
Uhm. No such luck, unfortunately. That horrible sound... He was grating his teeth. I thought my ears would explode!
Emeer:
Hm... Yep, not sure what came over me! Never happened to me before, sleepin' like that. Y'know, I didn't just fall asleep. More like I sorta blacked out, I guess. No idea why... Oi, you guys, whaddya think? Any ideas?
Barnham:
I think it bears no relevance. And there you have my honest answer.
Greyerl:
And I think it's good that I wasn't there.
Phoenix:
(But the question is: why did he black out like that...?)
I've got no idea
Phoenix:
(It's really odd, even for that guy, to just suddenly fall unconscious. But... I don't think I have any evidence to show what might have caused it.)
Luke:
Mr Wright! Maybe we could use some more information.
Espella:
I think Luke may be right. And I think that's what the professor is trying to tell us, too.
Layton:
............
Phoenix:
(To me, it looks like he's demanding I find the answer right this second... For now it's probably best to gather some more info, like Luke said.)
Leads back to cross-examination
I've got evidence
Phoenix:
Your Honour, I might have a clue as to why this witness suddenly lost consciousness.
Barnham:
You do?!
Emeer:
Really? D'ya work it out, Bluey?
Judge:
If that's the case, may the defence present some evidence! Which piece of evidence shows why this man fell unconscious?
Present Tomato Juice Bottle
Phoenix:

"Mister, I believe the reason you might have lost consciousness at the crime scene..."
Present anything else

Phoenix:
Well, isn't that it, mister?
Emeer:
*gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* Bluey! Wanna sip of this? It'll wake ya up!
Barnham:
I might like some as well. I'm suddenly overcome with sleepiness, due to boredom.
Judge:
It's getting quite late, and I must admit your tiresome mistakes are not helping me stay awake, either!
Phoenix:
(Looks like that wasn't the right evidence.)
Luke:
Mr Wright! As I thought, we'd better gather some more information before venturing a guess.
Espella:
I agree. And I think that's what the professor is trying to tell us, too.

Before questioning Emeer Punchenbaug correctly
Phoenix:
(That courier sure is committed to her work...or maybe just plain crazy.)
Luke:
Mr Wright, this testimony raises more questions than it answers, doesn't it? Sir Belduke wrote that letter the night before his death, and yet now it's blank.
Phoenix:
That's a mystery, all right. But there's something else unusual in what she said.
Luke:
There is?
Phoenix:
(The part about that guy going out like a light seemed strange to me as well.)
Espella:
That witness said he felt a surge of drowsiness at the time, but still...
Phoenix:
(Something about that seems kind of odd, even for a guy like him...) I have a feeling there's much more to Ms Mailer's testimony than meets the eye. I'll get to the bottom of this, don't worry.
Espella:
Good luck!

Phoenix:
That's a mystery, all right. But there's something else unusual in what she said.
Espella:
When she said "that guy" fell unconscious at the crime scene, she meant Mr Emeer, right? He said himself that he felt a surge of drowsiness at the time, but still...
Phoenix:
Maybe it's worth looking into the reason behind that drowsiness. What could have made him suddenly pass out and sleep like a log in a dead man's room?
Luke:
Oh! I think I know what it might have been!
Phoenix:
That's right, Luke. There's a certain piece of evidence that might be related here. (I suppose I should present that evidence and test out my little theory.)
Luke:
Let's try it, Mr Wright!
Phoenix:
Mister, I believe the reason you might have lost consciousness at the crime scene... is tied to a certain piece of evidence.
Emeer:
But wasn't it just because, y'know, I had a bit too much fun the night before?
Phoenix:
No. It was because of...this!
Barnham:
The tomato juice?
Phoenix:
You passed out right after drinking this juice. Therefore, it's not unreasonable to assume that there's a direct connection between the two.
Barnham:
Tomato juice does not make people fall unconscious, Sir Blue Knight.
Phoenix:
Exactly. That's why something must have been added to the contents of that bottle! Something like...a soporific!
Greyerl:
...!
Barnham:
Y-you mean, sleep medicine?!
Phoenix:
And if a soporific was mixed in with the tomato juice... that means Sir Belduke would have been unconscious at the time he was assailed!
Judge:
Oh! Oooooooh! Th-this sketch! Have another look. The red liquid trickling down from the victim's mouth... is proof that Sir Belduke must have drank the tomato juice!
Barnham:
I...I had failed to consider this...
Phoenix:
Inquisitor Barnham, I bet you remember saying this to the court: "Can you imagine anyone just sitting back and letting themselves be strangled? Clearly there should be evidence of a struggle! And since we haven't found any, that must mean the killer erased all traces of a fight from the crime scene." However! If the victim was unconscious when his assailant was strangling him... then the killer could have committed the crime through a small portal, big enough to put their arms through, after all!
Barnham:
Barnham:
That may be so, but tell me this: how would the culprit have managed to obtain such a strong soporific? ...Arghhh...!
Phoenix:
It was very simple. And I think you've realised why.
Barnham:
From the alchemist...
Phoenix:
That's right. An alchemist would no doubt have a wide array of various medicaments in their possession. And an apprentice would have little trouble stealing some of them from their study. Isn't that right...Ms Greyerl?
Greyerl:
............ How should I respond to that... "I'm sorry to disappoint you" may perhaps be the best way to put it.
Judge:
Wh-what do you mean...?
Greyerl:
Even though that juice bottle has been safely stored for the past three months... I'm positive it would be impossible to find any traces of that soporific now.
Phoenix:
...!
Barnham:
...You... You wicked...
...This is unbelievable... ...Was it really the butler who did it...?...But everything she says holds true......She was pretending to be a boy! That's mighty suspicious to start with......Is she...a witch...?
Mailer:
Siiiiiiiirrr!
Phoenix:

Barnham:

Mailer:
Hold on, everyone! The butler couldn't have done that to Sir Belduke! He...she would never, ever do it!

Witness Testimony

Greyerl:
Master took me in, a complete stranger. I will forever be indebted to him.
That's why I could never make an attempt on his life, through magic or otherwise.
Mailer:
Sir Belduke was a wonderful man! He's the one who recommended this line of work to me.
And he's the one who told me about it. The confidentiality obligation, I mean. I've never once broken it!
Judge:
It's true that Sir Belduke evoked fear due to his being an alchemist... However, he was also a man of admirable character, who supported the townsfolk through his research. Why would anyone want to kill such a man? This question keeps haunting me...however much I think about it.
Barnham:
Witches need no reason behind their evil. That is what makes them witches.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
How long has it been since you began serving Sir Belduke?
Greyerl:
I suppose it would be five years now. Before that, I'd lost everything. I had nothing and nobody left in this world.
Phoenix:
You lost everything?
Greyerl:
That's when Master Belduke helped me. He kindly took me in and gave me work.
Phoenix:
(What did she go through before she started working for Belduke?)
Greyerl:
Later, when I was helping Master with his research, he even taught me how to read and write. I was able to live comfortably for so long, all because of Master.
Phoenix:
(I don't know much about Greyerl... but she doesn't seem the type to kill someone she owes so much to.)
Barnham:
Everyone in this town knows how you served Sir Belduke. Now, you may continue your testimony.
Greyerl:
That's why I could never make an attempt on his life, through magic or otherwise.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You're claiming you had no reason to kill Sir Belduke...
Greyerl:
Yes. You can ask whomever you wish, and I'm sure they will say the same.
Barnham:
That is so. It is widely known that Jean Greyerl was devoted to serving Sir Belduke. It's difficult to imagine that she could brutally murder her respected master.
Judge:
Indeed, I am of the same opinion. I have visited Sir Belduke on several occasions, to enquire about this piece of evidence or that... and I must say I felt there was a strong bond of trust between him and Miss Greyerl.
Greyerl:
............
Barnham:
Do you still think you can come up with a motive?
Phoenix:
A motive...?
Barnham:
Jean Greyerl's motive for murder.
Phoenix:
(Greyerl risked a lot to conjure up a small portal in the wall. And then she killed Belduke. But what motive did she have?)
Suggest a motive for murder
Phoenix:
I understand. The defence will present evidence.
Barnham:
Evidence to indicate Jean Greyerl's motive for murder?
Phoenix:
...Precisely.

Barnham:
The one who ought to tremble is you, Sir Blue Knight!

Luke:
Mr Wright, I just thought of something... We might be basing our theory on a wrong assumption.
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
I understand. The defence will present evidence.
Barnham:
Evidence to indicate Jean Greyerl's motive for murder?
Phoenix:
...No.
Judge:
Wait...what?
Barnham:
What's this about, Sir Blue Knight?
Phoenix:
Sir Belduke's life was taken that day. That's a fact. However... was this actually the culprit's true objective?
Barnham:
Barnham:
What? This is nonsense! Sir Belduke was murdered. What other possible reason could there be, besides someone wanting him dead?!
Phoenix:
I'm fairly positive this piece of evidence will lead us to the culprit's real motive!
Judge:
Very well. Defence, present evidence... to indicate Jean Greyerl's motive for committing the crime!

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl had no reason for wanting to kill Sir Belduke.
Greyerl:

However, there was another incident that night, which is related to this case... And I have an idea what it was.
Barnham:
"Another incident"?
Phoenix:
I'm referring to this letter. Sir Belduke wrote a letter shortly before his death, yet all we have here are some blank sheets of parchment.
Greyerl:
Fascinating. Are you saying maybe a witch used some kind of ink-removing magic on that letter, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
No. The spell used by the witch was, of course, Godoor.
Greyerl:

Phoenix:
Let's go over the state of the crime scene one more time. As we know from Ms Mailer's testimony... the letter was in a letterbox next to the victim's head.
Judge:
Ah yes, it's in the sketch as well. The letterbox is on the far side of the shelf.
Phoenix:
The point of note is the location of that letterbox.
Barnham:
U-unbelievable!
Phoenix:
As Inquisitor Barnham seems to have noticed, the letterbox is within reach... of the small portal conjured by the witch, behind the painting on the wall.
Judge:
Oh, indeed it is!
Phoenix:
And, as Sir Belduke's butler... you would have known exactly where he keeps his letters!
Greyerl:
............ Indeed, Master Belduke would always keep his letters... in that letterbox, before posting them.
Barnham:
You...you mentioned no such thing!
Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl! You created a portal with Godoor... not with the intention of killing Sir Belduke. You were after this letter, weren't you?
Greyerl:
That's...merely wild conjecture. I didn't even know about that letter at the time!
Phoenix:
You didn't? Now that's very strange.
Greyerl:

Phoenix:
When Ms Mailer came by that night, Sir Belduke was busy writing that letter. And that's when you entered. Carrying a bottle of tomato juice.
Greyerl:
Ah...
Phoenix:
There's no way you wouldn't have known that you master was writing a letter to someone! And you could've known even more than that... For instance, perhaps you knew what he was writing about.
Greyerl:
That's enough! I served Master Belduke as his butler. I never would have pried into his private affairs! Whatever it was he wrote about in his final letter to the Storyteller... it is no concern of mine!
Phoenix:

Hmm. I think I may need to consider some other possibilities after all. (Rather than try to get any more info, maybe I'll be better off changing my perspective.)

Do not beat about the bush, witness! Answer the question!

Hm? What's up, Luke?
Luke:
Contradictions can be exposed without the need for evidence... The professor said something like that back when Espella was on trial.
Phoenix:
...! (Now that I think about it... The professor did talk about a different kind of weapon that I could use in court. Maybe I should keep that in mind and give it another try.)
Judge:
Witnesses, continue testifying!
Leads back to cross-examination
There's a contradiction
Phoenix:
There is a huge contradiction in Ms Greyerl's testimony!
Greyerl:
...!
Barnham:
You are becoming very predictable, Sir Blue Knight. If there is a contradiction, I hope you have the evidence to prove it!
Phoenix:
(Here's my chance. There's only one way to expose this contradiction...)
I'll present evidence
Phoenix:
The defence is ready to present evidence.
Judge:
Very well. The defence shall present evidence of a different nature. What does the defence believe to contradict Miss Greyerl's testimony?
Present anything
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That's the evidence! Now, tremble in awe at the power of my reasoning!
Barnham:
............
Judge:
............
Greyerl:
............
Judge:
Can you repeat that last bit? I'm afraid I misheard.
Barnham:
Even I have never used a catchpenny line like that.
Luke:
Well, I trembled a little! All those chilling stares are giving me the shivers.
Espella:
Mr Wright, no matter how cold everyone else might be towards you, I'll always stay on your side.
Phoenix:
(Presenting that evidence was a big mistake. Trying to show off was an even bigger one.)
Barnham:
The one who ought to tremble is you, Sir Blue Knight!
Phoenix:
Arghhhhh! (Ughh... That didn't go well.)
Luke:
Excuse me, Mr Wright...
Phoenix:
Hm? What's up, Luke?
Luke:
Contradictions can be exposed without the need for evidence... The professor said something to this effect when Espella was on trial.
Phoenix:
...! (Now that I think about it... The professor did talk about a different kind of weapon that I could use in court. Maybe I should keep that in mind and give it another try.)
Judge:
Witnesses, continue testifying!
Leads back to cross-examination
I can't present evidence
Leads to:
"The defence has no intention of presenting evidence."
Mailer:
Sir Belduke was a wonderful man! He's the one who recommended this line of work to me.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You mean you became a courier because of Sir Belduke?
Mailer:
That's right. I was also a, what do you call it... An orphan. I'd been stealing bread or apples and such from stalls and shops to survive. I was known far and wide among the traders in the shopping area. I was famous...or rather, infamous.
Phoenix:
(Was she stealing from Mrs Eclaire, too?)
Mailer:
And one day, Miss Greyerl took me there. To Sir Belduke's residence, I mean. Sir Belduke helped me. He helped me to find a suitable job.
Phoenix:
And so you became a courier?
Mailer:
Yes. See, I only had one real skill... I'm light-footed! At first I didn't take it seriously. The job, I mean. I didn't care about work. But then I realised it. That it's not so bad to be useful. You know, to other people. So, I owe him a lot too, you see. Sir Belduke, I mean.
Judge:
Hmph. What a heart-warming story.
Phoenix:
(I think the judge just wiped away a tear with the rim of his hood...)
Barnham:
The more you hear about Sir Belduke, the more obvious it will become that no one had any reason to want to kill him.
Phoenix:
(It sure does seem that way...)
Mailer:
And he's the one who told me about it. The confidentiality obligation, I mean. I've never once broken it!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The confidentiality obligation is a rule held among couriers, is that right?
Mailer:
Yes! A courier must not disclose the contents of a letter, nor the names nor addresses of its sender and recipient! But I'll tell you confidentially that, uhm... I love gossiping. Bad-mouthing people, especially. So I wasn't confident I could keep it. The confidentiality obligation, I mean. I was tempted to talk about this and that.
Phoenix:
(To think that Belduke trusted her...)
Mailer:
But then, Sir Belduke spoke to me. He told me this: "think [sic] about how you'd feel in that person's place". And that got me thinking. I really, really like to gossip. But when it comes to being gossiped about... People's messages are their secrets. And secrets must be kept!
Judge:
Indeed. No one would want their letters to be publicly known.
Phoenix:
(She's certainly determined when it comes to confidentiality... That's why she doesn't want to disclose the addressee of Belduke's letter. I'm not going to get it out of her.)
Mailer:
I promised Sir Belduke. And I'm going to keep it, no matter what! The promise, I mean. It's something I can pride myself on! ...Right?
Before changing second statement
Phoenix:
(End of the road for testimony...)
Espella:
Everyone knows that Miss Greyerl respected Sir Belduke. That's why...it seems so inconceivable that she could be the killer.
Luke:
She doesn't have any motive...
Phoenix:
(But that crime did take place.) At this point what we probably need to do... is look at this case from a different angle. Change the perspective, so to speak.
Espella:
...We just need to look at it from another angle? I wonder...
Phoenix:
I feel we're getting close to the truth here. Now I just need to follow it through. That's an attorney's duty.
Luke:
I'm sure you can do it, Mr Wright!
After changing second statement
Phoenix:
(Greyerl may not have had a motive to murder Belduke. But... what if she used the portal spell to obtain that letter? Depending on the contents of the letter, that might prove to have been her motive!)
Luke:
I wonder what Sir Belduke wrote about in that letter...
Phoenix:
There's only one way to find out... (I need to get Greyerl to admit that she got hold of that letter.)
Espella:
I'm worried, Mr Wright...of what's lying ahead.
Phoenix:
(The feeling's mutual... But I have to see it through. I've got to pursue the truth!)
Phoenix:
The defence has no intention of presenting evidence.
Barnham:
Wh-what?!
Phoenix:
The proof that there is a contradiction... cannot be found in the Court Record.
Greyerl:
What... What is the meaning of this, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
(The professor pointed it out to me in the previous witch trial... In this court, an attorney's arsenal isn't limited to the Court Record.)
Layton:
Each of the witnesses in this trial has given their own account of what occurred. Therefore...whenever one witness has testified, the other remaining witnesses have listened. Should one witness' [sic] testimony differ from another's testimony, then... I suppose that in itself can also be considered a contradiction, can it not...?
Phoenix:
(Juxtaposing contradictory testimonies from different witnesses is the key!) Ms Greyerl...
Greyerl:
...!
Phoenix:
Your testimony contradicts another one that we've heard in this court today!
Greyerl:
I had no reason to take his life nor steal his letter to the Storyteller.
Question Lettie Mailer's second statement
Phoenix/Espella/Luke:
Leads to:
"It was a single word that gave you away, Ms Greyerl."
Question any other statement
Phoenix/Espella/Luke:
Phoenix:
The testimony contradicting Ms Greyerl's is right here!
Luke:
M-Mr Wright, please hold on a moment! Were you just, as they say, trying to wing it by saying something random?
Judge:
Hmph... I'm not sure I follow what the defence is trying to say.
Phoenix:
I'm very sorry, Your Honour! The Golden Professor here seemed to be pointing out a contradiction there. I, uhh...guess he was wrong. Ha ha.
Luke:
Don't try to pin the blame on the professor!
Phoenix:
(I'm sure there was a piece of testimony that contradicted Greyerl's... I just need to put them side by side in my head and see which ones don't match up!)
Espella:
A little slip up is no reason to give in. Come on, let's try again!
Phoenix:
The testimony that contradicts what Ms Greyerl said is...
Leads back to testimony
Phoenix:
It was a single word that gave you away, Ms Greyerl.
Greyerl:
What...what do you mean by that?
Phoenix:
The name of the recipient. There were only a few people who knew the intended recipient of that letter. Four people, to be precise.
Judge:
Only...four people?
Phoenix:
First was Sir Belduke, the author of the letter. Then there was Ms Mailer, who delivered it. And of course the Storyteller, its recipient. As well as...one more person. The one who stole the letter, using a portal spell, and swapped it with the blank sheets of parchment...the witch.
Greyerl:
...!
Mailer:
Siiiiiiiirrr!!!
Maybe... Maybe I did. Maybe I spilled the beans. About the letter, I mean. Maybe I told the butler!
Barnham:
You did what?!
Mailer:
Uhm. Well, because, you see...me and the butler are sort of friends. And it was about our dear Sir Belduke. I feel like I might've told her about it after all! See? If I did, that's how she knew! About the recipient, I mean.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I understand that you are friends with Ms Greyerl and you want to help her out. But I've got a piece of advice, Ms Mailer. You shouldn't lie, even for a friend!
Mailer:
Huh...
Phoenix:
Remember your testimony. You told us about the courier's duty to keep the details of letters confidential. And you have also testified... that you have never broken that obligation. Remember?
Mailer:
Ah... Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirrr!
Barnham:
Barnham:
But...hold on just a minute. As the victim's butler, Jean Greyerl might have had a chance to catch a glimpse of the envelope.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
No. She didn't.
Barnham:
...!
Phoenix:
When Ms Mailer came with the delivery, Sir Belduke was still writing that letter. In fact, he was in the middle of it. At that time, the letter had not been addressed yet. And the next morning, when the body was discovered, that letter was already in the letterbox. Keep in mind that Ms Greyerl would have had no opportunity to see it then, either.
Barnham:
Is that...so...? She went to report the crime without even setting foot in the study...
Phoenix:
And then, Ms Mailer appeared and retrieved the letter. Needless to say, Ms Greyerl couldn't have learned of the letter's recipient afterwards.
Greyerl:
............
Phoenix:
Or maybe you have a good explanation, Ms Greyerl? I'd very much like to hear one. Can you please tell the court how you found out the recipient's name?
Greyerl:
............ Mr Wright...
Phoenix:
Uhm, yes?
Greyerl:
Do you remember what I said when I was called to the witness stand?
Phoenix:
Yes...
Greyerl:
At the heart of alchemy lies the pursuit of the rules and logic that govern nature. You have demonstrated the power of your own logic.
Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl...
Judge:
Are...are you saying...
Greyerl:
Yes. I confess. The abhorrent witch who used the spell Godoor to swap the contents of that letter... and who took the life of Master Belduke... It was none other than I.
I was an only child, born to a poor family. I've been a witch since I was very little... When did I become aware of it? I don't remember. Although I was but a young child, I knew that being a witch was a crime. That's why I hid my witch's sceptre and wouldn't use magic at all. My father worked as a bricklayer. He toiled every day, but we could hardly make ends meet. One winter day...we couldn't afford to pay the rent. We were going to lose the house. My mother was in tears, and my father was sitting with his head down, wordless."I want money for Mummy and Daddy!"
Greyerl:
That day, I suddenly remembered about [sic] the witch's sceptre that I had hidden.
Barnham:
The Goldor spell...
Greyerl:
I thought I'd try it, just once...casting the spell. But at the time, I had no idea what an irreversible mistake that would be.
Phoenix:
...!
Greyerl:
Even though no one told me... I knew from the very beginning what magic I was able to use.
What should I turn into gold? I was thinking about it really hard, the little girl that I was. Something that wouldn't stand out, that could be taken for a work of art. Then I decided. I chose a pretty leaf that had fallen into our garden."Goldor!"
Greyerl:
But...it wasn't the right thing to do after all. ...I was terribly punished for using magic, even just the once.
Judge:
Punished?
Phoenix:
...In what way were you punished?
Greyerl:
I placed the leaf down in the back garden and cast the spell. But then... Margaret suddenly walked in front of me.
Barnham:
Margaret?
Greyerl:
My...closest childhood friend. Margaret... Right before my eyes, she... She was turned into gold!
Judge:
Oh, dear me!
Greyerl:
I screamed and cried but...I knew I couldn't ask anyone for help. If anyone had seen it, they would have known it was the work of magic. And I knew...Margaret wasn't coming back.
Espella:
That...that's terrible...
Greyerl:
Then, my mother and father's faces flashed before my eyes.
We may have been very poor, but we were always happy together. Had I been captured as a witch, I feared my parents probably wouldn't be safe either. That thought tormented me more than anything. And so, I made the decision... I decided to end my own life. I threw myself into the river near the town. It was winter and the water was as cold as ice. I couldn't even move. It was painful. My consciousness started drifting away... ............ The next thing I knew...I was in Master Belduke's residence. He risked his own life jumping into the freezing river to save me. I burst into tears and told him everything. I didn't want to go back home. I would only end up causing my parents grief. Master Belduke listened to me without interrupting. And then, he told me this: "You can stay here. But from now on... you must live as a boy."
Greyerl:
Master Belduke met with my parents and explained everything to them. They were very sad...but they agreed it would be best if I didn't return home.
Espella:
Poor Miss Greyerl... That must have been so awful for her...
Greyerl:
Master bought the house for my parents, so they wouldn't have to worry about paying rent any more. As for Margaret, turned into gold...he brought her to his residence. He knew that if anyone saw her, they would report an incident of witchcraft.
Judge:
And this Miss Margaret, is she...still in that golden state?
Greyerl:
Yes...she is.
Barnham:
Hmm, that's strange. We have received no reports of anyone by that name having gone missing.
Greyerl:
Margaret is...being kept in the basement under Master's study.
Phoenix:
The...basement? Correct me if I'm wrong, but this Margaret... Is she a...
Greyerl:
Yes. My dear friend...was a goat that we were keeping at our house.
Judge:
A...
Barnham:
...Goat.
Greyerl:
Until then, Master Belduke had mainly been researching medicine... but since the incident with Margaret, he became known as an alchemist.
Phoenix:
(So that's when he became an alchemist... I was wondering why the goat was the only thing not covered in dust...)
Greyerl:
That's how I started a new life as Master Belduke's butler.
Judge:
Sir Belduke would sometimes work as a physician, curing the townspeople of their illnesses. As his assistant, you have also shown commitment to helping the townspeople through your work.
Greyerl:
I forgot about being a witch and was able to live happily, at peace with everyone... I thought it could stay like that forever... ............
Barnham:
...But those peaceful days came to an abrupt end. Tell us...what in the world was the cause?
Greyerl:
............ Even I am not quite sure what led to this. However... it all started three months ago, with that lightning strike.
Master Belduke and I were on our way back home, carrying specimens for experiments. An old bell tower appeared in the flames... Everyone who saw it was stupefied.
Greyerl:
But the expression on Master Belduke's face was unlike anything I'd seen before.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Greyerl:
His face went pale and twisted in sheer terror. He was shaking violently...
It wasn't just astonishment at an unusual phenomenon. It seemed as if he was afraid of something more concrete.
Barnham:
Perhaps Sir Belduke saw something that others couldn't.
Greyerl:
He cancelled his experiments for that night and began writing a letter to someone.
Judge:
A letter...
Greyerl:
I found out about it when I brought him his bottle of tomato juice.
He was writing feverishly, as if he were possessed. I... I saw some things. A few words in that letter... "...expose everything..." "...cannot keep this secret any longer..." "...the truth about the witch..." ......... Master Belduke... was going to confess... that I was a witch.
Greyerl:
Everything went black in front of my eyes. I will never forget the feeling... that overwhelmed me at that moment.
Judge:
Is that when you decided to commit the crime?
Greyerl:
What I did first was "accidentally" singe a part of the wall in my room. It was an excuse to repaint that section of the wall...green.
Barnham:
Then you also painted the wall behind that painting in Sir Belduke's study.
Greyerl:
And when that fateful night came...
I used a syringe to inject a soporific through the cork and into the bottle of tomato juice. So many thoughts were running through my head as I wished Master a good night. I opened the portal behind him... He was right there, in front of me, asleep. I reached for the letter in the letterbox, taking care not to wake him. And then I happened to notice the name on the envelope...
Greyerl:
"Storyteller".
When I read that name, the world all around me turned black once more. It's impossible to avoid what is written by the Storyteller... It seemed as if I could hear the doors to all escape routes shutting closed. It was the sound of despair.
Phoenix:
............
Greyerl:
I would like you to believe me... that the thought of taking Master Belduke's life never once occurred to me. I only planned to steal that letter and then disappear. But...
As I looked upon Master, sleeping there in front of me... at that moment, I felt an evil presence awaken within me. Why did he save my life? And...why did he betray me? Before I realised what I was doing... my hands were clutching his neck. He...didn't move at all. So I...I...kept on clenching his neck. ............ That's it... That's the truth about what happened three months ago.
Barnham:
There is just one thing I fail to understand.
Greyerl:
Yes?
Barnham:
You said you wanted to run away once you had stolen the letter. Yet despite that, you continued to live in Sir Belduke's residence. And now, here you stand. Why did you not run away?
Greyerl:
............ My life had been thrown into disarray due to the absurdity of magic. I had learned all about alchemy, living at Master's residence. Alchemy is concerned with the logic that governs the world. I...wanted to believe that there truly was such a thing. So I stayed in that place hoping to one day see the irrational nature of magic overcome by the power of reason.
Phoenix:
(Magic being overcome by reason...)
Greyerl:
That night... I swapped the letter with blank sheets of parchment and waited for the sun to rise. I resolved to wait for the day when my true identity could be exposed through reason and logic. Master's death remained a mystery for three months. And people started to lose interest. And then you appeared, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
...!
Greyerl:
On the day you visited the residence... I was listening to your conversation from the other room. "Has the time finally come for me?" My heart was racing with anticipation. Then... a few minutes after everyone entered that room, an unbelievable incident took place.
Judge:
That incident...
Greyerl:
A witch appeared...in Master's study.
Barnham:
Wh-what?!
Greyerl:
I wanted to get a look at the witch, so I created a portal in the wall behind the painting. Precisely at that moment...
"Goldor!"
The witch used one of the very spells that I can use, too. When I heard those words, a single thought flashed through my mind. This was my chance. I could dispose of my witch's sceptre!
Greyerl:
I knew at the time what kind of a witch the Inquisition would be looking for.
Phoenix:
A witch that can use Famalia and Goldor.
Greyerl:
It occurred to me that I only needed to change one of the magic gems. I had previously found out that the Famalia gem was purple. I realised that if I swapped the Godoor magic gem for my amethyst... I could pin the blame for my crime on that other witch.
Phoenix:
So you changed one of the gems and threw the witch's sceptre into that room, is that correct?
Greyerl:
...Exactly.
Barnham:
Barnham:
Wait a minute, Jean Greyerl! This statement of yours... is highly problematic!
Phoenix:
How so, Inquisitor Barnham?
Greyerl:
Yes...you are right.
Judge:
Can someone explain to me what this is about?
Greyerl:
I am a witch, indeed. A sinful creature that killed the person to whom she owed her life. However... regarding the gentleman standing next to you, Mr Wright... He may have fallen victim to a witch... But that witch was not me.
Phoenix:
Ah...
Judge:
Ohhh... Wait, whaaaaat?! Order! Order! Order in the court! What...in the... What is the meaning of this?!
Barnham:
Jean Greyerl admits killing Sir Belduke, but not to turning Sir Layton into gold. That is the gist of it, Milord.
Judge:
B-but lying about it is meaningless!
Phoenix:
Lying?
Espella:
Just being a witch is a crime in itself. And the punishment for that crime is the same, regardless of whether she took one person's life or two. That's why there's no point in lying about it. I'm sure that's what the judge is thinking.
Phoenix:
(Greyerl is still claiming she never laid a finger on the professor... But if there's no point in lying...does that mean she must be telling us the truth?)
Luke:
So in that case, who's responsible for what happened to the professor? If it wasn't her, then who was it?
Phoenix:
............
Barnham:
............
Greyerl:
............
............
???:
...Uhm.
Emeer:
Mind if I say somethin'?
Barnham:
............ Take a hint, witness. Does it feel like this is the right moment for you to talk?
Emeer:
Yeah, well. That's kinda why I was stayin' quiet until now. But... I either say it now or never. ............
Judge:
Don't simply fall silent after saying that! It only makes it weigh on my mind more! Whatever did you want to say?
Emeer:
............ Oi, Bluey.
Phoenix:
Y-yes?
Emeer
I need to make sure about somethin'. Me head's not what it used to be, y'know.
Phoenix:
Ugh... Yes...?
Emeer:
The alchemist's butler...uhm, lady butler. She slipped sleep medicine into his drink?
Phoenix:
That's correct. She laced his tomato juice with it.
Emeer:
And then he...uhm, she strangled the alchemist afterwards?
Phoenix:
Yes. Sir Belduke was unconscious from the sleep medicine, so he didn't resist.
Barnham:
And that explains why we found no signs of a struggle at the crime scene.
Emeer:
Yeah... About that... I let it slip earlier about what I did at the crime scene, right? I told you that...uhm...I had a few sips of that juice.
Barnham:
...And the sleep medicine mixed in made you sleep like a log. Yes, we remember.
Emeer:
Yeah, well... Here's the thing... This is just between us, okay? Y'see, when I appropriated that juice... the juice bottle was, well...still unopened.
Phoenix:
It was unopened?
Emeer:
Har har har. Me throat was parched, and I wasn't thinking straight. That brand new bottle was just there, waitin' for me, with a corkscrew conveniently laid next to it. I couldn't just let that go to waste. I swiftly pulled out the cork and got to drinkin'.
Barnham:
Wh-what...?
Emeer:
So, in case you don't get what I'm gettin' at, the alchemist... didn't have a single drop of the juice with the sleep medicine!
Phoenix:
Huh... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
Judge:
W-witness! You... You... ...went to the trouble of opening a bottle found at a crime scene just to drink its suspicious contents?!
Emeer:
That's what I've been tellin' ya, I was dyin' of thirst!
Judge:
That doesn't justify what you've done!
Barnham:
Barnham:
The Inquisition shall deal with this witness after the trial. He will find out what it means to be dying of thirst in a more literal meaning. However, let us not waste any more time with him now. The witch has confessed to her crimes. There is no need to investigate Sir Belduke's death any further.
Judge:
Hmph. Indeed, you are right, Inquisitor. Her role in the Sir Layton incident is not entirely clear... but a person who kills her protector, to whom she owes her very life, can be nothing other than a witch. The court has sufficient grounds to sentence her as such.
Greyerl:
............
Phoenix:
(Belduke didn't drink the juice that night... And if that's true, there's one thing here that doesn't add up.)
Luke:
Mr Wright! I have to say, there's something about this that's bothering me. I'm sure there's a contradiction lurking in that man's testimony.
Espella:
You think so, Luke?
Phoenix:
(Can I really turn a blind eye to that?)
Wait for the verdict
Phoenix:
(If the judge passes his verdict now, Maya should be found innocent. Getting her cleared of charges should be my priority as her attorney, I guess.)
???:
Nick...
Phoenix:
...! (That's Maya's voice!)
Maya:
Nick, you've already helped me out!
Phoenix:
M-Maya...!
Maya:
But... You haven't uncovered the whole truth just yet. It's not like you to leave this stuff unfinished!
Phoenix:
...! (My role here... is to trust my client and fight to the end. I need to find the truth!)
Leads to:
"Mister, you're saying you opened the tomato juice bottle..."
Investigate the contradiction
Leads to:
"Mister, you're saying you opened the tomato juice bottle..."
Phoenix:
Mister, you're saying you opened the tomato juice bottle... But that claim contradicts a certain piece of evidence!
Barnham:
Wh-what?!
Judge:
............ Defence, I'd like a word with you.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honour?
Judge:
At this point. your client's innocence has already been established. Therefore, whether there is a contradiction in that man's testimony or not should no longer be any of your concern.
Phoenix:
That may be so, Your Honour. But, even though I'm here to defend the accused... the true duty of any attorney is to uncover the truth behind what happened.
Barnham:
...!
Greyerl:
...!
Phoenix:
My job's not done until there are no more contradictions left!
Barnham:
............ Very well. Sir Blue Knight, let us hear about this contradiction you have discovered.
Phoenix:
(The bottle was first opened by that guy, meaning Belduke didn't drink any of it... That means there's one piece of evidence that should be very difficult to explain!)
Judge:
I would like to hear about this contradiction, too. The defence shall present evidence. Where is the contradiction in this witness having been the one who opened the tomato juice bottle?
Present Crime Scene Sketches
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The contradiction can be seen in one of the sketches of the crime scene."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Well, this is it!
Barnham:
Barnham:
What should I say? It seems it's too late in the day for you to think clearly.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Emeer:
Hey, Bluey! Would you like some too? Some tomato juice...
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Emeer:
Have a drink. It helps you think better when your mind's all mushy. *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp*
Birdly:
♪Tomato juice! A marvellous drink! Helps you concentrate, helps you think!♪
Phoenix:
(Wait, I thought the bard left already... I really wish he did...)
Luke:
The important part of his statement is that he opened the bottle... and that Mr Belduke didn't drink any of the tomato juice, isn't it, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
You got it, Luke.
Espella:
To put it another way, he didn't consume any of the sleep medicine.
Phoenix:
(And that makes one particular piece of evidence seem really strange...)
Leads back to:
"I would like to hear about this contradiction, too. The defence shall present evidence."
Phoenix:
The contradiction can be seen in one of the sketches of the crime scene.
Judge:
In one of the sketches?
Phoenix:
Please take a look at Sir Belduke's mouth. We can see a line of red liquid trickling down from his mouth.
Judge:
Yes, well. We have already established that it was the tomato jui- Oh!
Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honour. Sir Belduke didn't drink any of the tomato juice that night...
Barnham:
Barnham:
Which means, there's only one other possibility. That red line is, as we thought first of all, blood. Sir Belduke must have tried to fight back the assailant and bit his tongue in doing so.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Unfortunately, that would only bring us back to the problem we encountered earlier.
Barnham:
"Earlier"...?
Phoenix:
If the victim had put up a fight... then there should have been traces of a struggle at the crime scene. And yet, no such traces were found. That's what made you assume the witch must have used Famalia.
Barnham:
Ngh...! Y-yes, that is so...
Greyerl:
As I explained before... Master Belduke didn't struggle at all at the time. But when I think about it now, in light of the new information, it was very unnatural...
Phoenix:
(The victim didn't drink the soporific, yet didn't struggle...)
Judge:
But...what in the... What does this mean? If it's not tomato juice, nor blood brought about through a struggle with the murderer... then what else could it be?
Phoenix:
............ Since it's not tomato juice, we have to assume it's blood, after all.
Emeer:
Yeah, right? It's gotta be that!
Barnham:
We have ruled out the possibility that the victim bit his tongue while struggling with the attacker.
Greyerl:
Indeed.
Phoenix:
(Then there's got to be a different reason for that blood being there... He must have suffered internal bleeding that was somehow connected to his death... But what could have caused it?) ...Your Honour. If I may ask one question...
Judge:
A question? To whom?
Phoenix:
(If I just clarify this one suspicion, I may be able to explain the blood shown in the sketch. That's why I need to question one person in particular...)
Barnham
Phoenix:
Well, I'd like to ask...Inquisitor Barnham...
Barnham:
What, me?
Phoenix:
Uhm... Do you have any idea who I should question?
Barnham:
Why are you asking me?!
Phoenix:
(Ugh...I knew he'd get mad...)
Barnham:
If it's about the incident, then it would make sense to ask one of the witnesses, do you not think?!
Espella:
He may have yelled at you, but at least he answered your question, Mr Wright.
Luke:
Yeah, Mr Wright. You know...maybe there's a human heart beating under all that armour, after all!
Phoenix:
(A witness, huh... Who should I ask?) Your Honour! Please let me ask just one more question!
Judge:
I hope that this time you will think about what to say before opening your mouth.
Leads back to:
"If I just clarify this one suspicion, I may be able to explain the blood shown in the sketch."
Greyerl
Phoenix:
Well then, I have a question for Ms Greyerl!
Greyerl:
Yes, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
On the day of the crime... did anything go missing from the crime scene?
Greyerl:
Missing? Such as... the tomato juice that a certain person drank, do you mean?
Phoenix:
Y-yeah, something like that... But, was there anything else?
Greyerl:
Hmm, I'm afraid I cannot say. You may remember that I didn't enter Master's study that day. Not even once. If I may be so bold as to make a suggestion, perhaps it would be wiser to ask someone who went into Master's study.
Phoenix:
(She's right... I'll try again.) Your Honour! Please let me ask just one more question!
Judge:
I hope that this time you will think about what to say before opening your mouth.
Leads back to:
"If I just clarify this one suspicion, I may be able to explain the blood shown in the sketch."
Emeer
Leads to:
"Mister, can I ask you something?"
Phoenix:
Mister, can I ask you something?
Emeer:
Y-yeah? Don't give me that scary look, Bluey! I...I know nothin'! Nothin' at all. I've got nothin' to tell!
Birdly:
♪Emeer's as innocent as a little lamb. But is his confidence more than a sham?♪
Phoenix:
............ (He'd be better off without that bard.) You drank the tomato juice that was at the crime scene, right?
Emeer:
D-d-don't keep askin' me about that over and over again! S-so what if I did?!
Phoenix:
Then...I have another question for you. Did anything else disappear from the crime scene that day?
Emeer:
............ ............ ............ Nah...I didn't notice anythin'.
Barnham:
Barnham:
Witness! Just what have you done this time? You look like a dog caught making a mess on the carpet!
Emeer:
Wh-wh-wh-wh-why're you l-l-l-lookin' at me like that?! I dunno about anythin' goin' missin'! I'm innocent! Please believe me!
Birdly:
♪Truth could drown in his swimming eyes. Some tell lies well, others cannot tell lies♪
Phoenix:
(Looks like my gut feeling was right. He took something from the crime scene... Something that could be directly connected to that red liquid around Belduke's mouth.)
Judge:
What on earth did that man steal from the crime scene?!
Phoenix:
A certain item disappeared from the crime scene that day... And, at this very moment...it's highly likely that item is right in front of our very eyes!
Barnham:
What...? It's here?!
Phoenix:
Isn't that right, mister?
Emeer:
Is...is it? I, uhm, I have no idea!
Judge:
Defender! I order you to show us what this item is. The item that this witness took from the crime scene!
Present skull-and-crossbones bottle
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"It's this bottle!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The item he took from the crime scene is... probably something around here!
Judge:
That's too vague.
Phoenix:
Whaaaaaat? (Whoa, that was fast...)
Barnham:
This witness...is covered in jewels, in a manner that defies good taste. Surely he could conceal countless magic gems about his person.
Emeer:
Wait, what?!
Judge:
But...Inquisitor Barnham, this witness is of a rather masculine persuasion!
Barnham:
For all we know, he may be a master of disguise. We have been calling him "mister" all this while... But he may actually be a "missus"!
Emeer:
............ Uhm, Bluey?
Phoenix:
Yes?
Emeer:
If you've got somethin' to show the judge, please hurry up with it... I feel this trial is takin' a bad turn for me...
Barnham:
............
Phoenix:
(If I don't come up with the right answer now, Barnham will personally slay that poor guy!)
Leads back to:
"Defender! I order you to show us what this item is."
Phoenix:
It's this bottle!
Judge:
The bottle?
Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl, I'd like you to clarify something for me.
Greyerl:
What would that be, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Sir Belduke was working on creating certain medicines... He had various dangerous substances in his possession, as well. How were they stored?
Greyerl:
Master kept them in a locked medicine cabinet. The bottles were labelled so that it was clear that they were dangerous. They have all been confiscated.
Phoenix:
As for those labels... Did they resemble... the label on that guy's bottle?
Greyerl:
...! Mister... What are you doing with a product of Master's research?
Emeer:
It's not what you think! I didn't have any evil intentions, or nothin'!
Greyerl:
That bottle belonged to Master. And it was used... to store strong poison. Poison strong enough to kill...
Judge:
P-poison...?
Barnham:
Wh-what?!
Phoenix:
The red liquid trickling down Sir Belduke's mouth was definitely blood. Now, as for what caused him to bleed like that from his mouth... it was the deadly poison from the bottle this guy stole from the crime scene!
Barnham:
This is...outrageous!
Judge:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat! Order! Order! Orderrrrr!
Emeer:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! D'ya expect me to just keep quiet?! It was poison?! Poison! Am I...gonna die?!
Barnham:
Barnham:
Just wait and see. Time will tell.
Emeer:
Y-yeah, I guess.
Barnham:
More importantly, I want to know why you have that bottle!
Emeer:
Huh? Uhm. Well, that's... Uhh. Remember how I told you I drank the alchemist's tomato juice?
Judge:
Indeed. It's not something easy to forget... Especially having heard it several times.
Emeer:
Well...that was when I saw it on the floor. This bottle right here. It was totally empty. And I thought, y'know, it's such a fancy-lookin' bottle and all. I'm a bit of a skull-fancier. They have this air of danger about them, right?
Phoenix:
They certainly do.
Emeer:
So, since it was there, and I was there too, I felt we were kinda meant for each other. I thought, "This bottle's so classy I could die for it!"
Greyerl:
Had any poison been left in the bottle, you would have died instantly. But if it was empty, it was probably harmless.
Emeer:
Ooooh! Hear that? I'm gonna live! Good thing I rinsed it well before use! *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp*
Judge:
But if the victim was killed by poison... that raises a new question, of course.
Barnham:
Who could have poisoned him...?
Phoenix:
(Considering all the evidence and the testimonies we've heard today, the answer is so close, I can taste it.) Sir Belduke was poisoned by...
Greyerl
Phoenix:
It could've been no one else but... Ms Greyerl!
Barnham:
Barnham:
On that night, Jean Greyerl slipped a soporific into Sir Belduke's tomato juice... You have proven so yourself!
Phoenix:
Well, yeah, but...
Judge:
Had she intended to poison Sir Belduke, surely she would have had no reason to use any sleep medicine.
Phoenix:
............ That's...a good point. (Easy, Phoenix. You sure didn't think that one through properly.)
Barnham:
Keep pointing that finger at others without solid reasoning, defender... you may just get your fingers burnt!
Phoenix:
Arghhhhhhh! (Coming from Barnham, I don't think that's a metaphor...)
Leads back to:
"Considering all the evidence and the testimonies we've heard today, the answer is so close, I can taste it."
Himself
Leads to:
"It was, of course, Sir Belduke himself."
Emeer
Phoenix:
It was...that guy!
Emeer:
What's got into you, Bluey?! Me, poisonin' someone? I nearly poisoned meself! If anythin'...I'm a victim too!
Judge:
............
Barnham:
............
Greyerl:
............
Emeer:
Well...maybe not quite on the same level as the alchemist...but still. Anyway, how d'ya think someone like poor old me could've poisoned him?!
Phoenix:
(Easy, Phoenix. You sure didn't think that one through properly.)
Barnham:
Keep pointing that finger at others without solid reasoning, defender... you may just get your fingers burnt!
Phoenix:
Arghhhhhhh! (Coming from Barnham, I don't think that's a metaphor...)
Leads back to:
"Considering all the evidence and the testimonies we've heard today, the answer is so close, I can taste it."
Phoenix:
It was, of course, Sir Belduke himself.
Judge:
Sir...Belduke himself?!
Greyerl:
...!
Phoenix:
Sir Belduke took that poison of his own will. His death was suicide!
Barnham:
Barnham:
That is preposterous! A suicide? Inconceivable!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Think about it, Inquisitor! That would explain the most unnatural aspect of his death.
Judge:
The most unnatural aspect?
Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl, when you were strangling Sir Belduke... he put up no fight whatsoever, is that correct?
Greyerl:
Yes, it is. Until today, I was convinced it was due to the sleep medicine...
Phoenix:
It wasn't. Because he didn't take any. The truth is, when you gripped his throat, Sir Belduke... was already dead. He had poisoned himself!
Barnham:
Nghhhh!
Judge:
B-but would the poison have caused him to bleed from his mouth?
Barnham:
I personally know of no poison that works instantly and causes such symptoms.
Phoenix:
Oh... Y-you don't? (I can't just tell them that it happens on TV all the time...)
Greyerl:
There are certain plants in this area that contain a highly poisonous substance. In the course of his research, Master Belduke found a way to extract that poison.
Judge:
What am I hearing?! Is there really such a dangerous plant in Labyrinthia?
Greyerl:
The poison is very bitter to taste, so it would be impossible to secretly slip it into someone's food or drink... And it would cause internal damage. It is a very powerful poison... Drinking it would induce a most painful death.
Barnham:
And to think Sir Belduke could...
Judge:
But... did Sir Belduke really choose such an agonising death for himself? It doesn't seem like he suffered that much.
Greyerl:
...I would like to know that too.
Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl...
Greyerl:
You mean to say Master killed himself after exposing me as a witch? I...I cannot believe it! He...he just wouldn't commit suicide!
Barnham:
Indeed, we cannot take such a theory at face value! Had he committed suicide, I dare say he would have left a suicide note!
Phoenix:
............ I can't say why Sir Belduke committed suicide, but... I think there's a piece of evidence that can confirm his suicide was a possibility.
Barnham:
There...is a piece of evidence like that?!
Greyerl:
............
Judge:
If you have such evidence, you ought to present it to the court immediately. Present the evidence indicating that Sir Belduke's death could have been suicide!
Present Blank Letter
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"That's...Sir Belduke's letter."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
Hmph. Well, what say you to that, Inquisitor Barnham?
Barnham:
I have a single piece of advice for you, Sir Blue Knight. Should you choose to end your life out of shame from showing such pitifully inappropriate evidence... make sure you do not forget to write a will.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Judge:
That is to say... showing that evidence was somewhat ill-judged.
Phoenix:
(Ugh... That was a bad slip-up.)
Espella:
How can we know why Sir Belduke would take his own life?
Luke:
Only Mr Belduke himself could know the reason why he did it!
Phoenix:
Well, yeah... (If only he'd left some kind of message explaining why... Unless... Could he have left behind a suicide note after all?)
Leads back to:
"If you have such evidence, you ought to present it to the court immediately."
Judge:
That's...Sir Belduke's letter. Let's see...it was addressed to the Storyteller, wasn't it?
Phoenix:
This is the last letter written by Sir Belduke. Now, if his death was a suicide... then this letter may well be his suicide note!
Barnham:
Barnham:
What we have here is nothing more than blank sheets of parchment. Whether or not there was a suicide note is something we can only speculate about.
Phoenix:
That's right. But there is one person who knows whether this letter was really a suicide note.
Barnham:
You mean...the person who swapped its contents... In other words... You...Jean Greyerl.
Judge:
Witness, you stole Sir Belduke's letter on the night of the crime. Tell us, what was written in it?
Greyerl:
............ I don't know.
Judge:
Wh-what? You don't know?
Greyerl:
I did steal the letter, yes. But...I don't know what its contents were.
Barnham:
You mean you have not read it...?
Greyerl:
I couldn't bring myself to read it. It seemed that if I did... everything that had happened since Master Belduke saved my life would be ruined in an instant. I've taken it out and held it in my hands many times... But no matter what, I just couldn't...
Espella:
Miss Greyerl...
Phoenix:
Can you tell us where that letter is now?
Greyerl:
............ I have it here.
Judge:
Oh!
Phoenix:
Uh... You're...carrying it around with you?! If you were searched, you would've been done for!
Greyerl:
That night...having killed Master Belduke, I decided to stay in his residence. I knew my identity would be revealed sooner or later, and I was ready for it.
Barnham:
...!
Greyerl:
So, until that time... I decided to always keep the letter with me. ...Milord.
Judge:
Yes, witness?
Greyerl:
If you don't mind, could you please read it aloud?
Phoenix:
...!
Greyerl:
Now that I'm here, in this place of judgement... I think I'm finally ready to hear what Master wrote.
Judge:
Hmph...
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Ms Greyerl. I think you should be the one to read it.
Greyerl:
...Me?
Phoenix:
Sir Belduke wrote this letter to the Storyteller as he was preparing to die. I think it's only right his last words should be read by you.
Greyerl:
............ Yes, you're right...I see. I understand. Please allow me to read the letter aloud.
My dear friend... I hope you will be able to forgive me for leaving this world of my own will. I have finally made this decision, having seen that accursed bell tower appear in the flames on that dreadful night. That lightning was a sign that we have angered the gods. What I have done cannot be forgiven. I can never escape from it. For the past few days, I have been thinking that it might be best to simply expose everything. This town's secret... The truth about the witch... Of course, I understand that secrets need to be kept. However, I have grown very tired. I'm afraid I cannot keep the secret any longer. I have only two concerns. The first is my daughter. It pains me to be leaving her alone in this world... Although, she probably doesn't think of me as her father.
Phoenix:
(A daughter...?)
Barnham:
Hmm? I was not aware that Sir Belduke had a daughter.
Luke:
Mr Belduke seemed to know a lot about this town... This town's "secret"... And the "truth" about the witch...
Phoenix:
Truth about the witch... Somehow I don't think he was talking about Ms Greyerl.
Greyerl:
............ The second matter weighing heavily on my mind... is that Jean will be left on her own. Ah!
Seeing her growing up so strong and righteous, in defiance of her fate, had given me hope. A short while ago, she brought me my usual, and what will be my last, drink. There are so many things I wanted to tell her, but I could only manage a "thank you". She is a very sharp child. Had I said any more, she would have caught on. You could call me a selfish man... But I didn't wish my last memory of her to be a sad one.
Greyerl:
Master... Master Belduke...
Phoenix:
............
If the fate handed to her by this town has made her life an ordeal until now... I hope from the bottom of my heart that a wonderful story awaits her next. I intend to leave my residence to her. And I would like you to look out for her. Alas, it is time for me to put my pen down. My dear friend... what I truly wish to express to you is too complicated for words. I hope one day you will understand. But for now, I bid you farewell. The time has come for me to go.
Phoenix:
............
Barnham:
............
Greyerl:
............
............
Greyerl:
...This...this letter...
It wasn't a denunciation of me being a witch...
Phoenix:
Master Belduke cared about you... until the very end.
Greyerl:
...Yes... ...How could I have forgotten...? I'm sure...I knew it all along... So why did I... How could I have done that to him?* (Voice-over only)
Espella:
...Miss Greyerl...
Barnham:
............ Milord.
Judge:
What is it, Inquisitor Barnham?
Barnham:
I think it is about time. ...For the guilty verdict.
Phoenix:
G-guilty...?
Barnham:
The inquisition withdraws the charges against Maya Fey... and charges Jean Greyerl with being a witch.
Greyerl:
............
Barnham:
All the evidence corroborates this accusation, and she even admits her guilt. Hence, the inquisition asks that the witch be found guilty and punished immediately.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Not so fast, Inquisitor Barnham!
Barnham:
What do you want now, Sir Blue Knight?
Phoenix:
Admittedly, Ms Greyerl did attempt to strangle Sir Belduke... but he had consumed a deadly poison and was already dead at the time! Therefore, she is not guilty of murder!
Barnham:
............
Phoenix:
And one more thing! It also wasn't Ms Greyerl who turned Professor Layton into gold. There was another witch present at the crime scene. The defendant, Maya, saw her too! To put it simply... Ms Greyerl didn't kill anyone!
Barnham:
............
Maya:
Yeah, she didn't kill anyone! And yet... you still want to burn her?!
Phoenix:
M-Maya!
Maya:
Do you even know how it feels to be put in this cage? It's like everyone's against you and it's super frightening! I'm not a witch... but I've been thrown into this cage and almost sentenced for something I didn't do! And now you're about to do the same to another person?! That's just not right!
Barnham:
............ Is that all you have to say?
Maya:
Huh?
Barnham:
The one who's in the wrong is not me, but you, Sir Blue Knight.
Phoenix:
...!
Barnham:
Whether the witch committed a crime or not is completely irrelevant. This is the Witches' Court. All witches must be punished by fire!
Maya:
But...that's crazy!
Phoenix:
(Why...why, Barnham?!)
Espella:
............
Judge:
Inquisitor Barnham is absolutely right. Being a witch is a crime. You understand that, don't you, Miss Greyerl?
Greyerl:
...Yes.
Judge:
...Very well then. The court is ready to issue the final verdict. Maya Fey is found innocent! And in her place...
Jean Greyerl is found guilty of being a witch and shall be cast into the fire!
Maya:
Nooooo, you caaaaaan't!
???:
Espella:
Please, hold the verdict!
Phoenix:
E-Espella!
Barnham:
What is it now, Espella Cantabella?
Judge:
There is nothing else we can do. This is the course of things, and you should know it well.
Barnham:
Indeed. "All witches shall be cast into the flames." That is the law of this town... A law that was written by your very own father. And furthermore, a law that has always been obeyed in the town of Labyrinthia.
Espella:
A town like this...should never exist in the first place!
What? Such insolence...That's heresy! She's criticising the Storyteller's Story!Even the Storyteller's daughter has no right to criticise the Story!
Espella:
Trials in which innocent people are sentenced to death by fire... I shall make sure this is the last one!
Phoenix:
What do you mean, Espella?
Espella:
Since you're all so keen on the rules created by the Storyteller, you should know exactly what I mean. The stipulation for ending the witch trials: "Once the Great Witch Bezella is burned, the witch trials will end." At present... I am under suspicion. You know very well why that is, don't you?
Judge:
You...you don't mean that you're...
Espella:
I am guilty. I am the Great Witch Bezella!
Barnham:
What?!
Espella:
Now, cast me into the flames! And let Miss Greyerl free!
Greyerl:
...! Miss Cantabella...
Espella:
This shall be the last of the witch trials! No one else need be burned hereafter!
Phoenix:
Espella, just what are you saying?! I can't let you do that!
Espella:
Please, Mr Wright! Let me do as I wish. I'm sorry, but this is a problem concerning the people of Labyrinthia!
Maya:
No, please don't do it!
Luke:
There must be another way! You don't need to do this!
Espella:
It's all right. Luke, Maya... Mr Wright...and Mr Layton. I truly appreciate all you have done for me.
Phoenix:
(This can't be happening!)
Judge:
Miss Cantabella... Your confession will have very serious... or rather, fatal consequences for you. May we assume that you fully understand those consequences and are willing to accept them?
Espella:
............ I am Espella Cantabella, the Storyteller's daughter. But I also have another name... I am the Great Witch Bezella. I have lived hidden in the dark pages of my father's Story, deceiving all of you. Many lives have been sacrificed because of me.
But that shall end today.
Judge:
Court attendants! Seize that woman! She is the Great Witch Bezella!

Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
There is something very strange about that last statement!
Judge:
I think not, defender.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
If anything here is strange, I'd say it was you, defender.
Barnham:
Indeed, Milord. A baker turned defender, clad in such an outlandish outfit...is the very epitome of "strange"!
Phoenix:
Uwaaaaaaahhh! Th-the defence abstains from commenting on the inquisition's fashion sense, Your Honour...
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Your Honour! There's something odd in this witness' [sic] testimony!
Judge:
Hm...? I don't see anything odd...
Phoenix:
There's a...um...contradiction... somewhere in there...I think...
Judge:
From the look on your face, I can see you are not convinced. Hearing such a weak objection has put me in foul spirits... I think a penalty is in order.
Phoenix:
(Come on, is that really enough reason to punish me...?)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That testimony clearly contradicts this piece of evidence!
Judge:
That's rather hopeless. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
It's...hopeless?
Judge:
Yes. Entirely so. In fact, it's so hopeless it doesn't merit talking about it. And here is the punishment for your hopeless performance.
Phoenix:
(Saying everything I do is "hopeless" feels like sufficient punishment, to be honest...)

Question Primstone incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
May I ask you a question, Ms Primstone?
Ms Primstone:
Dearie, dearie me! Oh dearie, dearie me! My dear, do not frighten me so! I feel like a schoolgirl caught napping during class...
Phoenix:
Do you have something to say about the testimony we've just been hearing?
Ms Primstone:
Ms Primstone's lesson number one! "Asking questions leads to nothing but trouble!" As soon as people learned to speak, they began to get themselves into trouble with silly questions! This will be on the exam!
Espella:
I feel sorry for her pupils, having to learn about her gloomy outlook on the world.
Phoenix:
(Quite frankly, I feel more sorry for US, Espella...)
Judge:
Carry on with the interrogation!
Question Birdly incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Mr Birdly, can I ask you something?
Birdly:
♪So many questions for Birdly the bard! But most of them I shall disregard!♪
I have felt your keen gaze upon me for a while now. You can't help admiring me, can you?
Phoenix:
Uhh... The statement you heard earlier... Was there anything you'd like to comment on?
Birdly:
Hmm, I wonder if there was. My peerless companion, what do you think?
Cracker:
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!
Espella:
Oh, Mr Wright! He's imitating you perfectly! How adorable...
Phoenix:
(I can't say I share your love for the bird, Espella. It feels like it's mocking me...)
Judge:
Carry on with the interrogation!
Question Luke Triton incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Luke, I have a question.
Luke:
Shh! Please don't disturb me right now, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Luke:
I'm busy...thinking about whether there's something suspicious in the other witnesses' testimonies!
Phoenix:
(So, that means...)
Espella:
You haven't noticed anything yet...
Phoenix:
(Oh well... Guess I'd better leave him to his thinking.)
Judge:
Carry on with the interrogation!
Question Jean Greyerl incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
I'd like to ask Sir Belduke's butler a question...
Greyerl:
What is it, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Did anything in the statement you've just heard catch your attentio-
Greyerl:
No, there was nothing in particular.
Phoenix:
............ Umm...
Greyerl:
I have nothing to say about it, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
(Cutting straight to the point without even letting me finish...)
Espella:
Unlike you, Mr Wright, Sir Belduke's butler is always ready to go.
Phoenix:
(Um... I'm sure you didn't mean it like that, Espella... At least I hope you didn't...)
Judge:
Carry on with the interrogation!
Question Lettie Mailer incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Do you mind if I ask you something, Ms Mailer?
Mailer:
Siiiiiiiirrr!

Mailer:
So? You wanted something? What was it? What did you want to ask about?

There are witnesses whom you should not bother without reason. Keep that in mind, Sir Blue Knight.
Judge:
Please don't badger that witness unless you absolutely need to...or we will all go deaf.
Phoenix:
(I'd say it was her screech that was badgering our ears, Your Honour...)
Judge:
Carry on with the cross-examination!
Too many penalties
Judge:
There is no need for this trial to go any further. It has been proven beyond all doubt what the accused truly is. The court is ready to issue its verdict regarding Maya Fey!
Guilty
Judge:
Being a witch is a crime in itself. Such evil beings must be purged from this world. Now, you despicable witch! Prepare to meet your fate in the flames!
