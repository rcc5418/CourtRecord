Maya:
Um... Nick...
Phoenix:
Yeah?
Maya:
Did you know that Von Karma's daughter is only 18... Just like me...?
Phoenix:
Um, yeah. ...Why?
Maya:
I was just thinking about how strong she is... I mean, she's been in Germany all this time all by herself, and she's so grown up!
Phoenix:
...Yeah, and I'm sure she felt a lot of pressure from her father's reputation.
Maya:
...And then you look at me, and, well... I'm the daughter of the Master, but I'm still just a little girl. And on top of that, I'm the suspect in a murder trial.
Phoenix:
(Um... But I think you're really strong too, Maya, for all you've gone through...)
Pearl:
Good morning! The two of you look like you're doing well today. I'm happy for you!
Maya:
Hey! Morning, Pearly!
Pearl:
You'll be safe today, Mystic Maya!
Maya:
Huh? What do you mean?
Pearl:
My mother is coming today to show her support!
Maya:
Y-Yeah... Yeah! That's right, Pearly!
Phoenix:
Hey, Pearls...
Pearl:
...? Yes, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Um, do you think you could do me a big favor? Could you channel Mia today too?
Pearl:
Huh? ...I was sort of hoping to sit in the audience today and watch...
Phoenix:
...Please. It's very important to me. I don't feel confident enough without her help...
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! That's enough! You can't show weakness in front of the person you love!
Maya:
P-Pearly! N-Not this again...
Phoenix:
Please, can you do this for us, Pearls?
Pearl:
Um... Alright. I'll do it. I'll do it for Mystic Maya's sake. See you later, then! I'll leave you two to your alone time!
Phoenix:
...Phew, thank goodness.
Maya:
Nick?
Phoenix:
This way, Pearls won't be able to see today's trial...
Maya:
...Wh-What do you mean...? What's going on...?
June 22, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
von Karma:
Let's start already. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I look forward to tonight's news with great joy. The image of your defeated face will be transmitted all over the world!
Mia:
All over the world, huh? Sounds like you've made quite a name for yourself, Phoenix.
von Karma:
Don't be foolish, you foolish fool wearing the foolishly foolish clothes. The famous one is me! I'm the prodigy who has never lost a case since becoming a prosecutor five years ago. Naturally, the world's eyes are on me, as I conduct my first trial in this country!
Mia:
Uh, huh... That's nice, Ms. von Karma.
von Karma:
Hmph. Glad to see you're in such good "spirits" today, Ms. Fey.
Phoenix:
(Uhh... It's true what they say... Women really are scary when they fight... *gulp*)
Judge:
Now then. A very interesting theory was presented during yesterday's session.
von Karma:
That the defendant could have left the Channeling Chamber, correct?
Judge:
Yes. And this key is proof of that. This key, the only key to the Channeling Chamber, was not where it should have been.
von Karma:
Your Honor, I would like to say one thing before we begin.
Judge:
A-Alright... Let's hear it.
von Karma:
The prosecution has determined that from the time of the murder to the time of arrest, the defendant did indeed leave the room at one point.
Phoenix:
Wh-What!?
Judge:
But... Ms. von Karma! Then... How do you explain this picture? Are you saying then, that the person in this picture is not the defendant...?
von Karma:
I never said that wasn't the defendant.
Judge:
Th-Then what is the meaning of this...?
von Karma:
All I am saying is that Maya Fey, after killing the victim, exited the room. And I believe that is when she dropped this key.
Judge:
Can you substantiate your claim?
von Karma:
Isn't that what I'm here for? The prosecution would like to call the defendant's aunt, Morgan Fey, to the stand.
Mia:
...Just as I suspected. Aunt Morgan...
Phoenix:
(Poor Mia... She seems really torn by this...)
von Karma:
Witness. Name and occupation.
Morgan:
My name is Morgan Fey, and I am a spirit medium, in a manner of speaking...
Judge:
I'm sorry, but what do you mean, "in a manner of speaking"...? Aaah!
von Karma:
I don't think anyone really cares. Now then, after the murder took place, you kept watch over the defendant, correct?
Morgan:
Yes, that is correct. I performed the Spirit Severing Technique on Mystic Maya then.
Judge:
S-Spirit Severing Technique?
Morgan:
A technique to remove a spirit from a body and send it back to the other world. That is...
Judge:
Yes...? That is...? Mmfph!
von Karma:
You. Be quiet. Now, witness. Something happened while you were performing this technique, correct?
Morgan:
...Yes, that is correct.
Phoenix:
Wh-What in the world could've...!?
Morgan:
Mystic Maya... She escaped from the room...
Judge:
Wh-What!?
von Karma:
And here we come to the heart of the matter. Maya Fey, while in a possessed state, managed to escape from the Channeling Chamber!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Ms. Fey! Please testify to this court what happened during that time!
Morgan:
Your Honor, I will try my best...
Mia:
I think someone just upped the ante on this trial...
Witness Testimony
-- Maya's Escape --
Morgan:
After we heard the gunshots, those two broke the door open and entered the Chamber.
I requested that Mr. Wright and the other lady please contact the police.
A pistol was hanging from Mystic Maya's hand and she was in a daze...
Then, quite suddenly, she thrusted me away from herself and escaped from the room.
With great strength, she hit the base of my neck and I fainted for a short while...
I'm afraid I have no knowledge of where she went after that.
Phoenix:
Why have you hidden this until now!?
Morgan:
I... I did not wish to cause more trouble for Mystic Maya. However... I must correct falsities when they arise.
von Karma:
That's right. She is simply correcting a falsity, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Phoenix:
(Why is she making it a point to take a stab at me... Never mind.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, your cross-examination, please.
Mia:
My aunt is a very smart and sly person. It's going to be hard for us to find a crack in her testimony...
Cross Examination
-- Maya's Escape --
Morgan:
After we heard the gunshots, those two broke the door open and entered the Chamber.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Just now, you said, "those two." Who were the two people you were referring to?
Morgan:
I was referring to that foreign lady and yourself, good sir.
Phoenix:
Um, Lotta's not a foreigner... despite how she talks...
Morgan:
Oh, is that so? I'm sorry... I simply could not understand her atrocious English, not to mention she looked awful!
Phoenix:
(I can already see people in the heartland gearing up for a riot...)
Morgan:
In any case, I have already sent the repair bill to your office, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Oh, uh, thanks.
Judge:
Hmm... What did you do after that, Ms. Fey?
Morgan:
I requested that Mr. Wright and the other lady please contact the police.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Was it really necessary to have two people do something so simple as call the police? If there was a possibility of escape, then one of us should have stayed behind!
Judge:
Hmm, yes. That is a very good point.
Morgan:
At that time, I, myself, was a little confused. On top of which, there was another...
Judge:
Another what, madam?
Morgan:
Oh, it's nothing. No need to concern yourself.
Phoenix:
(I want to hear the end of that sentence...)
Question further
Phoenix:
There was another reason you wanted both of us out of that room, wasn't there!?
Morgan:
...
Phoenix:
You must testify! Why did you chase us out of the room!?
Morgan:
...I simply did not wish for there to be more victims.
Phoenix:
...!
Morgan:
"The lives of both the good sir and that camera woman may be in danger..." is what I thought to myself.
Judge:
Well, that was very noble of you, Ms. Fey.
Phoenix:
(This is bad... Now people have a good impression of her and a bad one of us...)
Mia:
Looks like she caught us napping. That's my aunt for you...
Judge:
Are you satisfied now, Mr. Wright? Ms. Fey, please continue.
Leave her be
Phoenix:
(The last bit of her sentence sounds like a red herring... If that's the case, I'm not going to fall into her trap today.)
Judge:
If the defense has no further questions, let us press on.
Morgan:
A pistol was hanging from Mystic Maya's hand and she was in a daze...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
During our investigation, you stated that you struck the defendant on the head, and this strike caused Maya to lose conciousness. Do you stand by this statement?
Morgan:
I'm afraid I don't. The statement I gave you was a lie...
Phoenix:
...! B-But why would you lie about something like that!?
Morgan:
It is very painful for me to say this, however...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
The witness was lying to cover for the defendant.
Phoenix:
(She was... covering for Maya...?)
Question further
Phoenix:
So, you were "covering for the defendant"!?
Morgan:
Well, yes... It was only later that I was informed of what had occurred. That the renegade Mystic Maya had done something very unexpected...
Judge:
S-Something unexpected!? What, pray tell, did sh-- Oogh!
von Karma:
This witness didn't and couldn't have seen what happened. If you want to know what this unexpected thing was, there is always later.
Judge:
Y-Yes, very well...
Phoenix:
(Ugh... Why does it suddenly feel like there's a rock in the pit of my stomach...?)
von Karma:
Now, witness, continue with what happened.
Leave her be
Phoenix:
(I'm sure Von Karma's allowing this testimony because it's advantageous to her... ...Which means I shouldn't press Morgan any further...)
von Karma:
You're finally beginning to understand, aren't you, Mr. Phoenix Wright... Now, witness, continue with what happened.
Morgan:
Then, quite suddenly, she thrusted me away from herself and escaped from the room.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Was it really that easy for her to escape from you?
Morgan:
I'm ashamed to admit to such a thing, however, yes...
Phoenix:
But you are physically larger and stronger than the defendant. There is no way she could have escaped from you so easily...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Have you forgotten already, Mr. Phoenix Wright? What about this picture!? Remember that at the time, the defendant was not physically "Maya Fey".
Phoenix:
...Ack!
Judge:
Hmm... Growing old is such a mysterious thing. Trust me, I know first-hand.
Morgan:
Basically, Mystic Maya's body was still that of the nurse she had called.
Phoenix:
But if she had run away, wouldn't you have given chase right away!?
Morgan:
Well, yes, I would have... however...
Morgan:
With great strength, she hit the base of my neck and I fainted for a short while...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You fainted...?
Morgan:
I became dizzy, and then collapsed onto the floor.
Judge:
How long were you unconscious?
Morgan:
I... I'm not sure. About ten minutes, perhaps.
Judge:
Hmm... And the defendant almost certainly went somewhere in that time...
von Karma:
Happy? Witness, elaborate on that point for us.
Morgan:
I'm afraid I have no knowledge of where she went after that.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Is that because you were unconscious?
Morgan:
Why, yes...
Phoenix:
(Great, well, now what...?)
Question further
Phoenix:
So while you were unconscious, you have absolutely no idea where the defendant went?
Morgan:
I would think that's obvious, good sir.
Phoenix:
If that's true... then how can you know for sure that the defendant left the Channeling Chamber at all!?
Judge:
Now that you mention it... I have to wonder myself!
von Karma:
It's true that this witness is not able to confirm this. But the key word here is "this" witness.
Phoenix:
What do you mean by that!?
Mia:
It means she has another witness up her sleeve. That's what. It looks like Ms. von Karma is ready to move on to her next witness.
Leave her be
Phoenix:
(If she fainted, then there's no way she can testify any more than she has... If I press her, I'm not going to get anything useful anyway...)
Judge:
Hmm... Well, then... Let's continue on with the testimony, shall we?
Mia:
I can't see a crack in her testimony...
Phoenix:
Wh-What should we do...?
Mia:
For now, we should try and get more information out of her. After we get more information from her we may be able to use it later to our advantage.
(Pressing second, third, fourth and sixth statement leads to:)
Judge:
That's enough! From what I can tell, there is nothing wrong with this witness' testimony. And from what she has said, we can establish that Maya Fey did leave the Chamber.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I hope this isn't going to come back and bite us in the butt...)
von Karma:
Now, let's take the next logical step and ask, "Where did the defendant go after leaving the Channeling Chamber?"
Judge:
Yes, yes... That is exactly what we should b-- Eeek!
von Karma:
Be quiet, you! Now then, what the escapee had done was she had gone to speak with a certain person!
Phoenix:
She... She went to speak with someone!?
Judge:
Wh-Who was it!?
von Karma:
The prosecution calls Ms. Ini Miney, who was sleeping in the Side Room at the time.
Phoenix:
I-Ini Miney...?
Mia:
I think you can see where this is headed...
von Karma:
Witness. Name and occupation.
Ini:
Um... OK, so my name is, like, Ini Miney. I'm, like, researching, like, parapsychology stuff at the, um, university.
Judge:
What is this "parapsychology"?
Ini:
Um... Let's see... It's, like, I guess, most people call it "occult stuff".
Judge:
Even if that's what most people call it, I can't say I understand what that means...
von Karma:
Then I suggest you go home and research it yourself.
Judge:
Yes, sir.
von Karma:
Now then, Ms. Miney, after the murder took place, you spoke with the defendant, Maya Fey. Is this correct?
Ini:
Um... Well... Hmm... Like, I guess...
von Karma:
If that's the case, then let's hear your testimony. That IS alright, isn't it, Your Honor?
Judge:
Yes, sir.
Phoenix:
(For the love of all things good, Your Honor, have some spine... For my sake...)
Witness Testimony
-- After the Murder --
Ini:
Like, when the channeling started, I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room.
Like, a little later, someone came into the room, like, really suddenly.
It was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister!
I, like, hadn't seen her in like, so long... I was so happy in, like, a sad way...
My sister... She, like, told me something, like, totally terrible.
Judge:
Now hold your horses, young lady! You're saying the person that entered was your sister!? Don't you mean the defendant, Maya Fey...?
von Karma:
Really, now... Your Honor. Maya Fey was still in the middle of channeling at that time.
Judge:
A-Are you saying that the spirit was the spirit of this witness' sister!?
von Karma:
Yes, Mimi Miney. She was a nurse at Dr. Grey's clinic.
Judge:
Oh... W-Well... This is...
von Karma:
Witness.
Ini:
Like, yeah?
von Karma:
In your testimony, you mentioned a "terrible" thing. Why don't you tell the court what this terrible thing was? I'm sure we'd love to hear about it.
Ini:
...Um, like... Do I totally, like, really have to?
von Karma:
Of course.
Judge:
Ms. Miney... please.
Ini:
... My sister... Like, this is what she said to me.
That was... no accident... I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini?
Judge:
She "took her revenge?" Are you sure that's what she said?
Ini:
Y-Yes...
von Karma:
There, are you satisfied, Your Honor?
Judge:
...I still can't believe it. I can't believe that a spirit would go so far as to use a medium to get revenge...
von Karma:
It is a bit hard to swallow, however, all the evidence and testimonies point to this as the truth! ...The end.
Judge:
...What do you think, Mr. Wright? It certainly seems like all the loose ends are accounted for...
Phoenix:
(This... This testimony just now... Was it all made up? Was it just one huge lie...?)
Mia:
Of course it was, Phoenix.
Phoenix:
...Mia! What do you mean?
Mia:
It's well constructed... but that's all it is. But even the most well-spun lies can be undone. We can do it, Phoenix. Let's find that one loose thread and unwind this tapestry of lies.
Phoenix:
Your Honor! There is room for doubt, so the defense will cross-examine this witness. We believe that our cross-examination will reveal the real truth behind this murder!
von Karma:
Yet again the foolish fool spouts out more foolishly foolish drabble... I wonder if you'll make this one more entertaining than the last...
Cross Examination
-- After the Murder --
Ini:
Like, when the channeling started, I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Was that because of your, um... sesame allergy, was it?
Ini:
Like, that's right. I, like, think there were sesame seeds, like, in the lunch they served that day. I had this, like, premonition that it was going to totally be a "seedy" day.
von Karma:
Yes, indeed.
Judge:
Hmm... I see...
Phoenix:
(...Am I the only one who missed the boat here...?)
Judge:
Anyway, so you were taking a nap. Did something happen while you were sleeping?
Ini:
Like, a little later, someone came into the room, like, really suddenly.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Do you know the time?
Ini:
Um, uh... Like, maybe a little before 11 AM? Something like that, I think...
Phoenix:
E-Eleven AM...?
Ini:
Yeah. Like, my stomach is totally ready for, like, food.
Phoenix:
... Ah, no... I think you misunderstood me... I'm not asking what time it is now... I meant what time was it when the "someone" came into your room!
Ini:
Oh! So, like, that's what you meant! Like, you shoulda been more, like, clear about it!
Phoenix:
S-Sorry. My bad.
Ini:
No, it's OK. Like, it's really...
Phoenix:
...
Ini:
...?
Phoenix:
...That's it? Why'd you stop mid-sentence!?
Ini:
Did I? ...So, like... what was I talking about again...?
Phoenix:
... N-Never mind...
von Karma:
...Witness. About this person who entered the Side Room...
Ini:
It was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure?
Ini:
...I guess?
Phoenix:
You "guess"...? Was it or was it not your sister who entered?
Ini:
Like, I don't know. I mean, like, I totally don't know "your sister" at all, Mr. Smith.
Phoenix:
(First off, my name is not Mr. Smith. Second, I'm an only child. ...Hmm, but more than that, she's managed to mess up the question with her answer...)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Th-The defense rests...
von Karma:
Well, that was a colossal waste of our time! Now then, witness. How did you feel when you saw Ms. Mimi Miney?
Ini:
I, like, hadn't seen her in, like, so long... I was so happy in, like, a sad way...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You were... happy in a sad way...?
Ini:
Yeah, like, I mean, it was my sister!
Phoenix:
But wouldn't most people react here with surprise at seeing a dead loved one alive again?
Ini:
Um, but, like, maybe if I was, like, someone who didn't know about, like, the occult. But I, like, know all about the Kurain Channeling Technique.
von Karma:
The point here, is the witness immediately recognized that it was her "sister".
Ini:
Yeah, like, what she said.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Should I drop this  line of questioning...?)
Question further
Phoenix:
So you really didn't think anything "strange" of the whole encounter?
Ini:
No. Like, there wasn't any reason for me to, like, think anything was "strange".
Phoenix:
But... OWW!
von Karma:
Don't keep badgering her.
Phoenix:
...You know the phrase, "Objection!"? Could you try using that once in a while...?
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Wright. This question of what the witness felt when she saw her sister... is it really that important?
Oh, it's nothing.
Phoenix:
"Is it really that important?" Let me ask you: Is it really that important for you to ask?
Judge:
Of course it's very important.
Phoenix:
Well, I don't think it's that important at all! Yeow!
von Karma:
Stop spewing such nonsensical things then. Pay no attention to this twit and continue, witness.
Ini:
Like, OK.
It is very important.
Phoenix:
It is very important! (Although I haven't quite figured out what "it" is yet. But I've got to bluff for now and make it seem like I know what I'm talking about...)
Judge:
Alright, Mr. Wright. Ms. Miney, please amend your testimony.
Ini:
Like, OK. I'm, like, totally cool with that.
Change statement:
"I, like, hadn't seen her in, like, so long... I was so happy in, like, a sad way..." to "I wasn't, like, scared at all. And, like, her costume looked totally, like, normal."
Leave her be
Phoenix:
(There's no need to press her over something this minor... I should be trying to find a more decisive problem with her testimony...)
Ini:
So, like, is it OK? I'm going to, like, finish my story, OK?
Ini:
I wasn't, like, scared at all. And, like, her costume looked totally, like, normal.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, there was nothing odd at all about your sister's appearance?
Ini:
Like, yeah. Nothing was, like, weird.
Phoenix:
(...Hmm...)
Mia:
...
Phoenix:
(Hm? ...Mia's talking to herself like she's found something wrong...)
Mia:
...That's impossible...
Phoenix:
(...?)
Ini:
Like, is everything OK? Can I, like, go on...?
Present Maya's Costume or Lotta's Photo 2
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"That was a very well-spun lie, Ms. Ini."
Ini:
My sister... She, like, told me something, like, totally terrible.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Something "terrible"? What was this thing she told you?
Ini:
Huh? Like, didn't I just, like, tell you about it? Did you, like, forget already?
von Karma:
A foolish fool with a foolish sieve for a brain only speaks foolishly with foolish words.
Phoenix:
(Well, excuuuse me, Princess. ...Anyway, should I ask to hear the story again...?)
Don't bother asking
Phoenix:
(I did just hear this story. It's not like my memory is that bad...) Actually, the defense is fine and does not need to hear the story again.
Judge:
Very well. You may continue your testimony, Ms. Miney.
Ask to hear it again
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, but could I hear the story one more time?
Ini:
Like, sure, no problem. I'll even, like, tell it all spooky-like for you.
That was... no accident... I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini?
Ini:
...Like, how was that?
Judge:
It was a little scary...
Ini:
Like, I'm sorry. Maybe I, like, put too much spookiness into it...?
Phoenix:
(I know there has to be something here I can use... But where!?)
Mia:
She really put a lot of thought into this lie, didn't she? We can't rush this. Let's take it slowly, one step at a time. She's bound to slip up somewhere. Don't give up. But don't get careless, OK? Remember, calm and collected.
Phoenix:
That was a very well-spun lie, Ms. Ini.
Ini:
...!
von Karma:
Wh-What are you babbling about this time, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?
Phoenix:
It's well constructed... but that's all it is.
Mia:
Stealing MY lines now, are we, Phoenix?
Phoenix:
Ms. Miney, may I remind you of what you said? You said that there was nothing strange about your sister's appearance.
Ini:
L-Like, yeah... And...?
Phoenix:
But I don't really think you thought that at all. Take a look at this picture. This is a picture of the "sister" you met. I would think that even you would be surprised if someone like this appeared before you.
von Karma:
... The blood spray...
Phoenix:
Ms. Miney! Why did you not include the blood you saw in your testimony!? If you were really testifying, and not lying, you would have noted it right off the bat!
Ini:
Ummm...!
Judge:
Order! Order! Ms. Miney! What is the meaning of this!?
Ini:
...
Judge:
...Ms. Miney?
Ini:
I'm thinking! Don't interrupt me!
Judge:
...Um, that... Eep!
von Karma:
And what are you stammering about, Your Honor...?
Judge:
Um, uh... Well... I... I uhh...
Mia:
That witness... Her personality did a complete 180 there.
Phoenix:
Lots of people do that when they get on the stand, though.
Mia:
...
von Karma:
First of all, calm yourself down, witness.
Ini:
... Like, I'm sorry. I, like, didn't mean to snap...
von Karma:
Now, hurry up with the testimony.
Judge:
I-If you please...
Phoenix:
(Ugh... The judge still looks a little shaken up... A lot of help he's going to be...)
Witness Testimony
-- After the Murder, Pt.2 --
Ini:
Like, the Side Room was, like, kinda dark, you know?
So like, the costume is, like, purple, right? The blood totally blended right in.
And I, like, persuaded my sister it wasn't, like, right to do something like that.
And then... like, I took my sister to the Channeling Chamber.
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, now I see. And you have given us a clear reason for why you didn't notice the blood.
Ini:
You think? Like, thanks, gramps!
Judge:
Are you satisfied, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Alright, I guess not... Very well. You may question the witness.

Phoenix:
Really? Because I thought it was pretty bright inside that room.
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Don't push your subjective opinions onto this court.
Ini:
Like, that's right!
Phoenix:
Um, excuse me, but how is my statement any more subjective than Ms. Miney's?
von Karma:
You are such a hopeless cause. Witness, you may feel free to ignore this trite little man.
Ini:
Like, OK.
Phoenix:
(Uuugh... Can't breathe... Let me outta here...)
Ini:
So like, the costume is, like, purple, right? The blood totally blended right in.

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You... didn't see the blood...?
Ini:
Like, yeah.
Phoenix:
But she must have had the gun with her at that time as well.
Ini:
...! That's um...
Phoenix:
Are you going to tell me next that you didn't notice the gun either!?
Ini:
I, like, totally didn't. All I was looking at was, like, her face...
Judge:
Hmm...
von Karma:
... Continue.
Ini:
And I, like, persuaded my sister it wasn't, like, right to do something like that.

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And what was your sister, Ms. Mimi Miney, like at the time?
Ini:
Well, she was, like, totally flipped out 'cause she just shot Dr. Grey... But, I think, like, she knew. She, like, said she did something really bad. And, like, she said she wanted to go with me to, like, apologize to Ms. Morgan.
Phoenix:
Did Mimi's spirit really say all that to you...?
Ini:
Like, yeah...
After pressing 4th statement
Phoenix:
May I ask you one more thing, Ms. Miney?
Ini:
Like, sure.
Phoenix:
Was there anything you found strange, unusual, or just out of place?
Ini:
Something out of place? Huh? Like, when do you mean?
Phoenix:
Uh, when...? Um... When you...
were in the Side Room.
Phoenix:
I'm talking about when you were in the Side Room, of course!
Ini:
Um... Like, no, nothing strange.

Leave her be

Judge:

Ini:
Like, OK.

I'm talking about when you were going to the Channeling Chamber, of course!

Um... Like, no, nothing strange.
Phoenix:
(She answered rather quickly... Now what...?)
Press harder
Phoenix:
Think harder! I know you can remember something!
Ini:
I, like, totally can't!
Phoenix:
That's not good enough! You have to explain yourself clearly to this court!
Judge:
Hmm... Do you think, Mr. Wright, that whether or not there was something odd on the way to the Channeling Chamber is all that important?
It's very important.
Phoenix:
I ask because it is VERY important! (...Not that I know where I'm going with this...)
Judge:
Very well. Ms. Miney, if you will, please include a statement about this in your testimony.
Ini:
Like, I don't get why, but, OK.
Add statement:
"I, like, didn't see anyone on the way to, like, the Channeling Chamber."

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Was your sister calm by that time?
Ini:
Like, I guess so... I guess maybe, like, taking her revenge on Dr. Grey, like, made her feel a lot better...
von Karma:
I'd like to feel a lot better too... Mr. Phoenix Wright. The sooner the better...
Phoenix:
(She says with her whip at the ready...)
Ini:
And, like, Ms. Morgan was the only one in the Channeling Chamber, you know?

Something you finally pull out of a witness is never a dead end, Phoenix.
Present Sacred Urn
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I've finally found the fault, or I guess in your case, the "crack" in your perfect lie.
Ini:
...
Phoenix:
Take a look at this urn.
Ini:
Like, urn...?
Phoenix:
There are cracks. Do you see them?
Ini:
S-So? Like, what does that prove?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Who cares about some worn-out old urn!?
Ini:
Like, yeah. I already, like, said I didn't see, like, anyone on the way to the Channeling Chamber. I didn't, like, totally say anything about, like, an urn, did I?
Phoenix:
It looks like you still don't understand. I propose that if you had really been walking along the Winding Way at that time, there was no way you could not have seen this person!
Present Pearl Fey profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I'd like to introduce someone to you."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Oops, silly me. Slip of the finger.
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright. You need to keep control of that finger of yours'.
Phoenix:
...As I thought, this is the wrong piece of evidence. Oww!
von Karma:
An irresponsible lawyer has no place in this court! I suggest you go home!
Phoenix:
(Oww... So it's come down to a blunt "go home"...)
Mia:
Don't over-think this. All you need to do is remember what happened yesterday.
Leads back to:
"I propose that if you had really been walking along the Winding Way at that time,"
Phoenix:
I'd like to introduce someone to you. This is Ms. Morgan Fey's daughter, Pearl Fey.
Judge:
Y-Yes...? And how is this child relevant...?
Phoenix:
It just so happens that at the time of the murder, Pearl was playing in the center garden.
Judge:
Oh...
Phoenix:
And she just happened to break this urn.
Judge:
Oh... OHHH!
von Karma:
W-Wait! She... broke the urn...?
Phoenix:
Yup. She accidentally knocked it over with her ball!
Ini:
Nnaaawrr!
Leads to:
"And Pearl was the one who put it back together..."
Present Pearl Fey profile
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You say that you didn't see anyone on the way to the Channeling Chamber... However, that is impossible! I'd like to introduce someone to you. This is Ms. Morgan Fey's daughter, Pearl Fey.
von Karma:
Interesting, you have a semi-intelligent look on your face. So? What about this child?
Phoenix:
It just so happens that at the time of the murder, Pearl was playing in the center garden.
von Karma:
The garden...?
Phoenix:
Yup! Which means anyone walking through the area would have to have seen her! So, Ms. Miney, what do you have to say to that!?
Ini:
Nnaaawrr!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
As the court can see... she's a bit of an airhead. Also, she was leading her "sister" at that time. Do you honestly think she would have noticed a simple child playing!? Preposteous!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
It's not preposterous, and I can prove it!
von Karma:
Wh-What sort of foolish...
Phoenix:
There is no way someone walking along the Winding Way could not have noticed Pearl!
Present Sacred Urn
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This urn is my proof."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Oops, silly me. Slip of the finger.

Leads back to:
"There is no way someone walking along the Winding Way could not have noticed Pearl!"
Phoenix:
This urn is my proof.
von Karma:
An old, cracked clay pot? What is that going to prove?
Phoenix:
Do you know why it's cracked? It's because Pearl broke it! That's why!
Judge:
She broke the urn...? Yeow!
von Karma:
Why... Why do I feel like you're about to ruin my beautiful day...?
Phoenix:
This urn was broken around the time the channeling started!
Ini:
Ah!
Leads to:
"And Pearl was the one who put it back together..."
Phoenix:
(No good. I can't find anything wrong...)
Mia:
Phoenix, the Judge believes this testimony. If you don't find some sort of hitch in her statement...
Phoenix:
He'll end the trial... I know...
Mia:
We have to give it another shot! It doesn't matter how many times we listen. We can't give up!
Phoenix:
And Pearl was the one who put it back together... ...while sitting right in the middle of the Winding Way!
Ini:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?
Phoenix:
Ms. Miney.
Ini:
...!
Phoenix:
Pearl was there, in the Winding Way at that time. She was hard at work, putting the pieces of the urn back together, you see. If you couldn't see that while you were walking, I'd have to declare you legally blind!
Ini:
G...Grrrrr...
Phoenix:
I think I have sufficiently proven one thing, Ms. Miney. You are a masterful liar!
Ini:
Arghnnn!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You need to watch what you say!
Phoenix:
The one who needs to watch what she's saying is the witness! So, Ms. Miney! Tell us the truth!
Ini:
A-About what!?
Phoenix:
About what!? About where you really were at the time of the murder, of course!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
The witness just testified about that!
Ini:
Th-That's right! I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room...
Phoenix:
(...Can I really believe her? Was she really sleeping in the Side Room...!?)
Yeah, I guess so.
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess so. Sorry, my mistake.
Judge:
Very well. Now, then, let's proceed.
Mia:
Wait! Phoenix!
Phoenix:
Wh-What? Did I miss something again?
Mia:
You shouldn't let up on this line of questioning.
Phoenix:
Huh? Why not?
Mia:
Who is the only person you didn't see with your own eyes at the time of the murder?
Phoenix:
It was Ini Miney, correct?
Mia:
Which means, you can safely assume... She is the real murderer.
Phoenix:
That's a pretty daring assumption...
Mia:
But it's the most obvious, isn't it? I mean, is there anyone else?
Phoenix:
Well, no, I guess not.
Mia:
It's worth a shot, even if it's in the dark. So, let's try to prove that Ms. Miney was not in the Side Room at the time!
Phoenix:
(Umm, this is bluff number...? We've done this so many times in this case I've lost count.)
Leads to:
"Your lies end here!"
There is no way!
Leads to:
"Your lies end here!"
Phoenix:
Your lies end here!
Ini:
Wh-What do you!?
Phoenix:
The witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room. And I say that's not possible, because there is clearly a contradiction here!
Judge:
A contradiction...!? Where is this contradiction!?
It's in her testimony just now.
Leads to:
"Earlier in your testimony, Ms. Miney, you made the following statement."
It's in the evidence.
Phoenix:
The answer is in the Court Record!
Judge:
Wh-What!?
von Karma:
Hmph. Planning to throw out another irrelevant piece of evidence?
Judge:
Very well. The court will see this evidence...
Mia:
Wait!
Phoenix:
M-Mia!
Mia:
I don't know what you plan on showing to the court, but I can guarantee you the answer is not there. Just this once, I'll lend you a hand. Now, rethink your answer.
Phoenix:
A-Alright...
Judge:
Mr. Wright. What is your answer?
Phoenix:
(Argh! OK, time to add another bluff to the pile...)
Leads back to:
"The witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room."
Help me, Mia!
Phoenix:
(Hmm, I may have overreached on this one... Is there really a contradiction somewhere...?)
Mia:
Don't worry, you're on the right path, Phoenix. It might be a little hard for you to see the contradiction, but it's there. So, just this once, do you want me to help you out?
Yes, please help me!
Phoenix:
Please, I need your help right now!
Mia:
H-Hold on... First, calm down, Phoenix. ...Good. ...That girl... She slipped up with her words.
Phoenix:
...Her words?
Mia:
If she really was in the Side Room the entire time, then she just testified about something she shouldn't have any knowledge of.
Phoenix:
A-And what is that!?
Mia:
The rest is for you to figure out on your own.
Judge:
Mr. Wright. What is your answer?
Phoenix:
(Argh! OK, time to add another bluff to the pile...)
Leads back to:
"The witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room."
No, I think I can do it.
Phoenix:
(Hmm, it's "hard for me to see"...? I can't just accept her help without thinking it through myself!)
Mia:
Ha ha, that's the spirit. Give it another try.
Judge:
Mr. Wright. What is your answer?
Phoenix:
(Argh! OK, time to add another bluff to the pile...)
Leads back to:
"The witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room."
Phoenix:
Earlier in your testimony, Ms. Miney, you made the following statement.
Ini:
And, like, Ms. Morgan was the only one in the Channeling Chamber, you know?
Phoenix:
It's true that at the time, both myself and Ms. Hart were not there. We had gone to call the police.
Ini:
...S-So? Like, what does that, like, have to do with anything!?
Phoenix:
It's very simple. Ms. Miney, how did you know that fact?
Ini:
...H-How...?
Phoenix:
I concede that Ms. Fey was the only person in the Channeling Chamber. However, someone who was "asleep" in the Side Room could not have known that!
Ini:
...!
Phoenix:
Which means, Ms. Miney! You did, in fact, go to the Channeling Chamber. However, you didn't go there by way of the Winding Way!
Ini:
Gwaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Judge:
B-But! Look at the manor guidemap! If one were to go between the Side Room and the Channeling Chamber, one would have to use the Winding Way!
Phoenix:
Yes, that's right, Your Honor. Which is why... Which is why I ask this very important question! Where was the witness at the time of the murder!?
Ini:
...Umm... Urrrr...
Phoenix:
Ms. Miney! Please answer the question!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
... Don't ask a question off of a baseless assumption, if you please...
Phoenix:
...!
von Karma:
Well, I suppose since you've put it out on the table, Mr. Phoenix Wright... you might as well answer the question for us! "Where was the witness at the time of the murder!?"
Mia:
Now's your chance, Phoenix.
Phoenix:
Yeah!
Mia:
The only person who could have killed Dr. Grey was Ini Miney! So now is the time to prove it!
Judge:
Now, then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear your answer. Where was the witness when the murder took place...?
Present Channeling Chamber
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ms. Miney was here, of course!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
She was here...
Mia:
Phoenix! Did you turn the map upside down!?
Phoenix:
(...Oww... Sh-She slapped me on the wrist...)
Mia:
There is no way she could've committed the crime from there!
Judge:
*ahem* You two! Keep disrupting this court, and this trial is over. Is that clear!?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor... Sorry...
Leads back to:
"Now, then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear your answer."
Phoenix:
Ms. Miney was here, of course!
Judge:
Wha... But... But that's... the Channeling Chamber...
von Karma:
Isn't that the crime scene!?
Phoenix:
That's right! Ms. Miney was at the scene of the crime!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ...That's... Why, that is...
Judge:
Uwaah!
von Karma:
Mr. Phoenix Wright! Have you lost your mind!? Yesterday's testimony established that only the victim and the defendant were in the Chamber when the channeling started!
Judge:
Yes! Yes, that is correct! Please, explain yourself, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Simple. Ms. Ini Miney was hiding at the scene of the crime.
Ini:
I... I was hiding!? Where!? Like, where was I hiding!?
Present area behind the folding screen
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Here, of course."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Ms. Miney was hiding here! Owww!
von Karma:
If you're going to tell a joke, at least make it one I'll laugh at.
Ini:
Hah! Go home, boy, and look up what "hiding" means!
Phoenix:
(Argh... Looks like I'm going to have to one up her!) Yeah, count on it!
Mia:
Phoenix, you can't lose your cool like this! ...And, grow up.
Phoenix:
Eh?... Oh, um, sorry, Chief...
von Karma:
You still haven't learned your lesson, have you, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?
Leads back to:
"Where!? Like, where was I hiding!?"
Phoenix:
Here, of course.
Judge:
B-Behind the folding screen? Aah!
von Karma:
Don't make me say this again! Recall yesterday's testimony!
Lotta:
There ain't no way anyone was hangin' out behind that foldin' screen!
Ini:
See! You stupid jerk! Quit being so quick to pin it on me, slimeball!
Judge:
...N-Now, now... Ms. Miney... One so young as you shouldn't be saying...
Ini:
Shut it, gramps. As if you know exactly how old I am!
Judge:
I-I'm sorry!
Phoenix:
(Looks like the pipe's about to burst... Guess I should help it along...) The witness was hiding behind the folding screen... With the help of this!
Present Clothing Box
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ms. Miney!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Ini:
Yeah, you go ahead and use that to hide!
von Karma:
And you should hide in shame until you die!
Phoenix:
(What's with these two...? It's like they did a mind meld all of a sudden...)
Mia:
Don't let them affect you! Just think about the correct answer.
Ini:
What's wrong, boy!? Come on, say something, you loser!
Leads back to:
"...N-Now, now... Ms. Miney... One so young as you shouldn't be saying..."
Phoenix:
Ms. Miney! How you were able to hide at the scene of the crime is very simple! You were hiding inside this box!
Ini:
Aaah! Th-Th-That tiny little box!? No person could fit in that!
Phoenix:
Sorry, but your theory has already been disproved. (Lotta disproved you when she was hiding from me in it.)
Ini:
Umm...!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
But that clothing box was in the Side Room, right!? Which means it has nothing to do with the murder at all!
Ini:
Th-That's right! I was sleeping there, so I should know! That clothing box was there in the Side Room, the whole time!
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Wright. Do you think you can prove where the clothing box was at the time of the crime?
No, I can't.
Phoenix:
Hmm... It's kind of hard to prove...
Mia:
...
Phoenix:
Um... I guess by that look, there is a way to prove it?
Mia:
If you look in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Guess I should take a look at the Court Record...)
Judge:
Well, then. If there are...
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
P-Please wait... I said it was hard, but I didn't say it was impossible to prove!
Judge:
Then stop puffing up your feathers and hurry up!
Leads to:
"And now, I present the piece of evidence that will prove"
Yes, I can with some evidence.
Leads to:
"And now, I present the piece of evidence that will prove"
Phoenix:
And now, I present the piece of evidence that will prove this clothing box was at the scene of the crime when the murder took place!
Present Folding Screen or Clothing Box
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Take a look at this clothing box."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
..............................
Phoenix:
...Um... Your Honor...?
Judge:
I... um, fell asleep...
Mia:
You got lucky, Phoenix! Now give it another shot!
Phoenix:
A-Alright...
Leads back to:
"And now, I present the piece of evidence that will prove"
Phoenix:
Take a look at this clothing box.
Ini:
You're soooo stupid. As if there's any sort of evidence in that old thing.
Judge:
...! Th-This... What on earth...!? Mfph!
von Karma:
I don't have time for you to sit there surprised. Hurry up and say it already!
Judge:
Th-There's a hole! About 8 inches off the ground!
Phoenix:
Hmm, a hole about 8 inches off the ground. Where have we heard that before...?
von Karma:
...The folding screen... It had a hole at the same height...
Phoenix:
That's right! I hope this has opened your eyes to what happened! At the time of the shooting, the clothing box was sitting behind the folding screen. Which is why the bullet from the pistol hit both the box and the folding screen! It went through the screen, and then into the box.
Ini:
...Nnngh...!
Phoenix:
Ms. Miney! You were hiding behind the folding screen, waiting for your chance! Yes, for your chance to kill Dr. Grey!
Ini:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Judge:
Order! Order! ...So what you are saying--
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Th-Then... Mr. Phoenix Wright! What about this picture!? Are you saying that the person in this photo... is Ms. Ini Miney!?
Phoenix:
That is exactly what I am saying! Ms. Ini Miney! You were hiding inside this clothing box all along! And you wore a medium's costume to masquerade as Maya Fey!
Judge:
T-To masquerade as Maya Fey!?
Phoenix:
She had it planned from the very beginning! She would kill Dr. Grey, and pin the blame on my client!
Ini:
...N...No... S-Stop...
von Karma:
...I can't stand to listen to any more of this foolishness! If that's the case, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I have a proposition! This whole idea that the witness moved the clothing box to the crime scene, pretended to be the defendant, killed the victim, and then fled the scene of the crime; It's not possible for one person to do all that by herself!
Correct. It's not possible.
Leads to:
"It really is impossible."
No, it is possible.
Phoenix:
I'm sure it's possible if you were to try! Ow!
von Karma:
I don't want to hear "if"! If you're going to give me "if", then give me some proof along with it. Where did Ini Miney get the costume then!? How about the wig!?
Phoenix:
Uh, I wasn't talking about that exact point... I meant, people, humans. If we want to do something bad enough, then...
Judge:
That's enough! Beyond simply proposing that it is possible for one person to commit this crime, it is the duty of a lawyer to back up his or her claims.
Ini:
Yeah, it's your duty!
Judge:
If you can't do that, then your proposal falls flat.
Ini:
Yeah, it totally falls flat!
Phoenix:
(...Why... Why do you have to hurt me so...?)
Mia:
It's alright, Phoenix.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Mia:
It isn't possible for one person to commit this crime, but...
Phoenix:
(... Ack! That's... That's right!)
Leads to:
"It really is impossible."
Phoenix:
It really is impossible. For one person to do all the preparations, that is. Owww!
von Karma:
Need I remind you!? The foolish receive no mercy...
Phoenix:
W-Wait! Ms. von Karma... You said it was not possible for "one person", correct?
von Karma:
Wh--! Y-You can't be serious...
Ini:
...*huff*...*huff*...
Phoenix:
Ms. Miney! You had an accomplice!
Present Morgan Fey profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...Grr... This person...!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
The accomplice was...?? Any thoughts, Ms. von Karma?
von Karma:
... I don't even want to waste the energy to raise my whip. His lady friend can deal with him.
Mia:
Really, Phoenix! You even got Ms. von Karma to give up on you too!
Phoenix:
..."Too"?
Mia:
As in, "me too".
Phoenix:
O-Oh... Okay, I'll think more carefully this time...
Leads back to:
"Ms. Miney!"
Ini:
...Grr... This person...!
Phoenix:
If it wasn't someone from Kurain Village, you couldn't have gotten the costume. And if it wasn't someone from the Fey household, you wouldn't have that box to use.
von Karma:
Morgan... Fey!
Judge:
Isn't that the wonderful lady witness we had earlier!?
Phoenix:
What do you have to say to this, Ms. Miney!?
Ini:
...Grrr... Grrrrrrrrrrr...
Phoenix:
You shot Dr. Grey with your own two hands! Do you deny it!?
Ini:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
I think this is what really happened. The murderer had planted herself at the scene of the crime long beforehand. Dressed in a medium's costume and wearing a wig, she pretended to be the defendant. And then, the channeling started. The murderer crept silently towards the other two, both of whom had their eyes closed. ...First, she drugged Maya Fey with a strong sleeping agent. Then, she stabbed Dr. Grey with the knife! Next, she hid my client inside the clothing box... She did that so she could take Maya's place and frame her for the crime.
Mia:
...But that's when something unexpected happened.
Judge:
Unexpected...?
Phoenix:
Yes.
*bang!*
Phoenix:
Dr. Grey was actually not yet dead! With the last of his strength, he fired a shot at his attacker! And that is why the hole in the folding screen was so low to the ground! The murderer then took the gun from Dr. Grey, and...
*bang!*
Judge:
After that, you and the other lady thought to break into the room...?
Phoenix:
Yes, a gunshot is certainly something you wouldn't expect to hear. Which is why, upon hearing the shots, we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber.
*klik*
Phoenix:
Ms. Miney... She immediately covered her own costume with blood...
*klik*
Phoenix:
And pretended to be Maya Fey.
von Karma:
B-But! That sort of deception would have been easy to see through!
Phoenix:
Which is precisely why Ms. Morgan Fey chased us out.
Morgan:
Please leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police! Hurry! Before there are more victims here!
Judge:
Wh-What is one supposed to say...?
Phoenix:
This is the real truth behind this murder.
...Ha......Ahahahaha...
Judge:
Wh-Who is that!? Laughing at a time like this...!?
Judge:
Ack!
von Karma:
Oh, you simpleminded fools. I'm sorry, are you still by chance, evolving?
Phoenix:
Wh-What is it this time...?
Judge:
M-Ms. von Karma... Surely...
von Karma:
Of course it was me! Do you really think someone of Von Karma blood would lose due to something this petty?
Phoenix:
WHAT IN THE WORLD!?
von Karma:
Mr. Phoenix Wright! Your argument is flawed in one very crucial area!
Phoenix:
And that is...?
von Karma:
If this witness is the real murderer... why would she go through all this trouble?
Phoenix:
...Huh?
von Karma:
Working together with a medium, pretending to be one, putting on this whole act... What reason would she have to do such foolish things?
Phoenix:
Eh? Well, that's... Uh...
Ini:
Yeah, that's right! That's exactly what I was gonna say!
von Karma:
Oh, and one other thing. Why would Ms. Ini Miney want to kill Dr. Grey? Where is her motive?
Ini:
Yeah! That's exactly what I wanted to say too! Yeah! Motive! I don't have a motive!
Phoenix:
A... motive... That's... (I can't say she has no motive here! I have to think of a motive now! What is her reason for wanting Dr. Grey dead...?) The reason you wanted Dr. Grey dead is this!

Phoenix:
(...Ack! I've got to take my time and think carefully about this...)

Phoenix:
(...Only one...?)
Leads back to:

Ini:
...Hah! Just as I thought. You bore me with your silly answers, Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:
(Just great. Now even SHE is calling me by my full name...)
Ini:
You think I did this to get revenge for my sister's death?
Phoenix:
Yes! Because through that accident, you suffered a lot of hurt and pain yourself!
Ini:
Don't be stupid! No one has proof that Dr. Grey drugged my sister, right? And you want to say I wanted to take revenge based on nothing?
Judge:
Wh-What do you mean by that...?
Ini:
Senile, stupid gramps. ... I'm, like, going to explain, so, like, please listen, OK? It's been over half a year since I was discharged from the hospital. If I, like, wanted revenge, then, like, I wouldn't have waited this long. Um, and 'sides, like, the guy that thought of the spirit thing, was, like, Dr. Grey. It was, like, a total coincidence he asked me about it, you know?
Phoenix:
(She... She's back to her airhead self...!) H-However, you see-- Eeeowch!
von Karma:
Pathetic, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You failed to support your own theory. ...The end.
Judge:
I think we have our answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. What Ms. Miney has stated is very true. The revenge plan is overly complicated, and she has no motive in the first place. Furthermore, there is no reason for Ms. Morgan Fey to cooperate with this plan. You don't even have any truly decisive pieces of evidence to demonstrate your point.
von Karma:
Tsk, tsk. So many faults, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You should really learn your place.
Phoenix:
Nnghuuurk! (Wh-What happened!? I thought I had her for sure!...)
Ini:
Hee hee... See, like, that's what I, like, told you!

I'm going to serve you a slice of humble pie!
Judge:
Very well, I now conclude the cross-examination of Ms. Ini Miney!
Hold it!
Mia:
Your Honor. Please, allow the defense one more minute.
Judge:
Alright.
Mia:
You can't lose here. Have faith in yourself, Phoenix!
Phoenix:
Mia...
Mia:
Yes, it does sound like a ridiculously messed up plan for a murder, but you know, regardless, that girl trained for this crime.
Phoenix:
...R-Really?
Mia:
... Listen, Phoenix. Everything happens for a reason. There is a reason for why she had to kill Dr. Grey. And it is also the reason she had no choice but to kill him in this fashion.
Judge:
Time is up, Mr. Wright. Your final answer, please. If you want to say that you can prove Ms. Miney had a motive, then... why did she kill the victim in this way? Can you provide the reason?
Phoenix:
(...Can I... Can I really do this...?)
Yes, I can.
Leads to:
"(I am not totally confident here, but I know that I must press on no matter what...)"
No, I can't.
Leads to:
"(I am not totally confident here, but I know that I must press on no matter what...)"
Phoenix:
(I am not totally confident here, but I know that I must press on no matter what...)
Mia:
That's right, Phoenix! Only you can do this now!
Phoenix:
I will show and substantiate the fact that Ms. Miney had a motive!
Ini:
Ha ha ha. Too bad. You're too late! My cross-examination has already ended, after all. Eeek!
von Karma:
...Interesting. I'll let you have your chance, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Ini:
Wh-What!? Y-You're supposed to be on my side! Aiiiii!
von Karma:
A Von Karma only cares about the perfect win. As long as you have the will to fight, I will knock you down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:

von Karma:
And I don't care if you are my witness! So help me, I will blow you out of my way!

Very well. The court will take a 5 minute recess. We will continue the cross-examination after we reconvene.

...Is it really true... about my aunt...?
Phoenix:
I'm afraid so, Maya. There is no way Ini could've killed Dr. Grey by herself. And under the circumstances, there's no one else other than your aunt, Morgan.
Maya:
That... That's terrible... Why? Why would my aunt...?
Everything is going just as I predicted, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Phoenix:
Ack! Ms. von Karma!
Maya:
Why are you doing this!? Why are you trying to take revenge on Nick!? Nick had nothing to do with what happened to your dad.

Don't you have something better to be worrying about? Say, your own situation?
Maya:
Ugnn... ...Looking down on me, even though we're the same age...

Not yet. My goal is to defeat you, and let the whole world know of your defeat.

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
Can you prove Ms. Ini Miney had a motive?
Phoenix:
Yes, I believe I can. (Ini Miney and Dr. Grey have only one point of connection. And that is the car accident one year ago. The motive I'm looking for must be there...) Ms. Miney. Please testify to this court about your car accident last year.
Ini:
Huh? I thought, like, you wanted to, like, ask about my, like, motive. I, like, don't see the point in, like, bringing up the past.

And like, the night of the accident, my sis was totally tired while she was driving.
I was, like, totally pooped too, so I, like, fell asleep in the passenger's seat...
I, like, woke up 'cause of a jolt, and, like, it was a sea of flames around me.
I, like, opened the door and, like, got away.
Judge:
Hmm... I think I've heard of this incident.
Phoenix:
It was all the talk on the tabloid shows, day after day, last year.
Judge:
Yes, and there was talk about Dr. Grey... drugging your sister...? Gwuugh!
von Karma:
Those were merely "rumors". ...Totally baseless gossip.
Judge:
Hmm, yes... Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.
Mia:
Right now, it's impossible to prove that Dr. Grey did in fact drug Ms. Miney's sister.
Phoenix:
Yeah... Which means I'll have to work this from another angle.

Phoenix:
Was that the fault of your sister, Mimi Miney?
Ini:
Like, no way. Dr. Grey, like, wanted to blame it on my sis...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
That incident has nothing to do with our murder here. Besides, the police report has already documented that it was entirely Mimi Miney's fault.
Phoenix:
(Which means as far as the "real" facts are concerned... Mimi Miney is the one who made the mistake...)

But, like, it really wasn't my sis...

True, true.

Ah, but like... I don't, like, have a driver's license...

Hmm, well, it's alright. No need to push yourself.

I think I, like, gave an interview after the accident. Like, that would probably be the most accurate, you know?

Yes, that perverted fake clinic director. And how did you know he was perverted. Eowch!

The accident happened last May. That's a half year lapse in time, Mr. Phoenix Wright.

Anyway, without a license, the witness and her sister could not have switched drivers.

They're expensive, and their driver's seat is opposite to our cars here in the States. It would seem there is no benefit to owning one.

It's an article about the accident. You had said this in it: "But I opened the right door, and, like, got out"... That's correct, isn't it?
Ini:
Like, why are you suddenly asking me about that...?
Phoenix:
Your Honor. Which side is the passenger's seat: the left or the right?
Judge:
Well, it's on the right side, of course, because the driver's on the left side.
Phoenix:
That would be if it were an American car. But it would be the opposite in a British car.
Judge:
Opposite...?
Phoenix:
The two of them were riding in a British car! In that case, the passenger side would be the left side!
von Karma:
Aaaaah!
Judge:
Wh-What do you mean by this!?
Phoenix:
Ms. Miney! You said that you had escaped using the right side door of the car! But if you were sitting there, then that means you were in the driver's seat!

O-Order! Order in the court! Order! Ooooooooorder!! Order... Ack!
von Karma:
Mr. Phoenix Wright is blabbering nonsense again! Ini said the person who was driving was her older sister, Mimi Miney!
Phoenix:
That is what Ini said, yes But that is where her story falls apart. Somewhere, all of us made a big error in our assumptions! 
Mia:
Phoenix. It looks like you've finally found the real root of this murder!
Phoenix:
If we connect all the dots, there can only be one answer! I'd like to ask the court a question. Ini or Mimi -- who was really driving that night?
Ini Miney
Phoenix:
And the answer is Ini Miney, of course!
Judge:
Wh-Why would you say that?
Phoenix:
Ms. Ini Miney just said so herself in her testimony! She said that she escaped the car from the right side door! Which would have been where the driver's seat was! Owwwww!
von Karma:
I'm inclined to feel sorry for a foolish fool who foolishly spends his time foolishly. At that time, Ms. Ini Miney had not yet received her driver's license!
Phoenix:
And that is why the accident happened!
Mia:
Hold it, Phoenix! It looks like you still don't see the real truth behind the accident.
Phoenix:
Th-The "real truth"...?
Mia:
Think outside the box! Isn't that what we always say?
Phoenix:
(A-Alright, one more time...!)
Leads back to:
"If we connect all the dots, there can only be one answer!"
Mimi Miney
Leads to:
"The answer is the one person who had her driver's license, Mimi Miney."
Phoenix:
The answer is the one person who had her driver's license, Mimi Miney. After all, that makes her the only person who could legally drive!
Judge:
B-But, you just said... The witness, Ms. Ini Miney, was the one in the driver's seat!

Th-The next
Judge:
Th-The next question!?
Phoenix:
Who is the person standing on the witness stand right now?
Ini:
... Uuughn!
von Karma:
What sort of idiotic ruse is this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Th-This witness' name... This witness' name is...
Phoenix:
I'll tell you what her name really is. This witness' real name is...!
Present Mimi Miney profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Mimi Miney. That is your real name."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
... Would the defense please inform the court of its birth name?
Phoenix:
Umm... Phoenix Wright... Your Honor.
Judge:
Ah, what a relief. I thought you'd forgotten your own name... Again.
Mia:
I was beginning to think he forgot too.
Phoenix:
Wait a second... I screwed up didn't I?
Mia:
Big time. Listen. This is the grand finale. Don't hold back! Let it all out on this one!
Phoenix:
A-Alright, I'll give it another shot!
Leads back to:
"I'll tell you what her name really is."
Phoenix:
Mimi Miney. That is your real name.
Ini:
...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Of all the foolish dribble! Th-Then, how do you explain her appearance!?
Phoenix:
When she was admitted into the hospital, this witness was suffering severe facial burns. So for the purpose of facial reconstruction, they used a picture.
von Karma:
Facial reconstruction surgery!?
Phoenix:
This is the picture she gave to her doctors at the time. That's right! It's a picture of her younger sister!
Ini:
Nooooo!
Judge:
B-But... Mimi Miney... She died... In the car accident!
Phoenix:
That's what everyone thought. However, that was not the case.
von Karma:
Th-Then, the body they found at the crash site...
Phoenix:
That was the body of the real Ini Miney. Isn't that right... Ms. Mimi Miney!?
... ...
Phoenix:
(That car accident one year ago... The one who died that night was Ini Miney. Her sister, Mimi, then stole her face... And was reborn as Ini. With this, she effectively erased "Mimi Miney" from existence!)
Mia:
Your Honor. I'm sure you can now see why Mimi had to kill Dr. Grey.
Judge:
Wh-What do you mean? Aaah!
von Karma:
What is the meaning of this nonsense!?
Phoenix:
Dr. Grey wanted to call back the spirit of a dead person. Specifically, the spirit of his nurse that died in the crash, Mimi Miney. However, that would not have been possible! Because "Mimi Miney" was still, in fact, alive! And that fact would have been discovered had the channeling been conducted. So this witness had to stop that from happening... ...at all costs!
von Karma:
And... And... And that's why she had to kill Dr. Turner Grey? Is that what you're saying!?
Phoenix:
Yes. Before the channeling, Dr. Grey had the misfortune of consulting this witness about communicating with the dead. And in that moment, his fate was sealed!
Judge:
W-W... Well, Ms. Ini...? I mean, Ms. von Karma... Eek!
von Karma:
Why did you say MY name, just now!?
???:
... Looks like I've been unmasked.
von Karma:
W-Witness...?
Mimi:
That's right, I admit it. My real name is Mimi Miney.
Phoenix:
...!
Mimi:
That quack doctor... He got what he deserved in the end. And I was so close to finally ditching "Mimi" too. So close...
Judge:
But... But why!? Why would you go so far to throw away your self...? To become your own sister!?
Mimi:
...
Phoenix:
(I think I understand why... Mimi Miney wanted her self to disappear because of this...)
Present Newspaper Clipping 1
Phoenix:
Take that!
von Karma:
Th-That's... That's about the malpractice incident!
Phoenix:
Dr. Grey was right. The mistake was caused by the nurse. A nurse by the name of Mimi Miney. That's right, the person standing before us today. And a few weeks after this mishap, Mimi Miney had a car accident, in which she lost her younger sister.
von Karma:
Th-The timing couldn't have been worse...
Phoenix:
Fourteen patients dying in that incident, and her own sister's life, extinguished. It was all too much to bear.
Mimi:
...I found a way for myself to escape it all... The only way...
Phoenix:
She lost everything in the flames of that accident, her sister... ...and even her own face. This was her last chance... Her chance to throw away her past and start a new life as her "sister"...
Judge:
...Unbelievable... A plan beyond my wildest imagination...
Leads to:
"That jerk..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Mia:
Just stop.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Mia:
I feel embarrassed for you for even thinking of showing that piece of evidence. That woman... She had lost everything. So this was the only way to make things right, Phoenix.
Phoenix:
(Looks like this wasn't the right piece of evidence after all... I guess I don't fully understand this case yet...)
Leads to:
"That jerk..."
Mimi:
That jerk... If only he hadn't thought of that channeling mumbo-jumbo...
Phoenix:
...Mumbo-jumbo?
Mimi:
Becoming Ini has been the most horrible experience in the world. Spirit channeling, the occult... I hate it! I hate it all!
Judge:
...I believe there are still a few unsolved riddles here... Why did you set a murderous revenge plot into motion? And why did Ms. Morgan Fey agree to help you with the plan...? Regardless, I believe one thing has been made crystal clear.
Phoenix:
The innocence of the defendant, Maya Fey...
von Karma:
Th-This... This is preposterous! I... I'm perfect! Me... Franziska von Karma...
Phoenix:
I'm going to enjoy the news tonight, Ms. von Karma. How about you? It's going to be broadcast all over the world, right? Your defeat, that is... Yeow!
Judge:
Ohhh!
Mimi:
Aah!
Phoenix:
Owowowowwwowoowowowowwowwwowwowwwooowowwooowowowoowooowowowoowooww
von Karma:
And one more for good measure!
Mia:
Ph-Phoenix! Hang in there, Phoenix!! PHOENIX!!!
von Karma:
This court is a fraud! A sham!
Judge:
...Now then, it looks like it will be some time before Mr. Wright regains consciousness... so I will go ahead and pronounce the verdict.
Not Guilty
Judge:
That is all. This court is adjourned!

Mia:
Congratulations, Maya.
Maya:
S-Sis!
Mia:
It's good to see you, Maya... How are you doing?
Maya:
Sis! Sis... I-I didn't kill anyone, did I?
Mia:
No, you didn't. It was all just a dream... A really bad dream.
Maya:
You know, sis... In my dream, I smelled a really familiar scent.
Mia:
A familiar scent...?
Maya:
I was inside that clothing box, right? That box... That was the box you used to store your clothes in a long time ago...
Mia:
That's right!
Phoenix:
Hmm... There is still one thing I don't quite get.
Mia:
What's that?
Phoenix:
What would've happened if Mimi hadn't shot Dr. Grey...? I mean, we broke in because we heard a gunshot.
Mia:
I think Mimi Miney had planned to open the door to the Chamber herself. And then, you and Lotta would have witnessed quite a scene; a "possessed" Maya Fey, who had just committed a murder.
Phoenix:
She had it planned down to the smallest detail, huh...?
Maya:
Nick!
Phoenix:
Congrats, Maya.
Maya:
Thanks! Looks like you bailed me out of another jam.
Phoenix:
Well... you know...
Maya:
But... I really don't want something like this to happen ever again.
Phoenix:
...?
Maya:
I'm fine because I have you to help me out, Nick... But every time something happens, I lose someone special to me. First my sister... And now my aunt...
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Hey, Nick... Tell me... Tell me why my aunt went and did something so horrible? Why would she help Ms. Mimi with a plan like that...!? I just... I just don't understand it, Nick...
Phoenix:
Maya, it's over. Why don't we just let it be.
Maya:
Nick, please, I need an answer...
Phoenix:
(The reason Morgan helped Mimi with her plan was...)
Present Pearl Fey profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Maya:
... Pearly?
Phoenix:
Four years from now, a new Master will be "born" into Kurain Village. And that person will be you, Maya.
Maya:
A-And...?
Phoenix:
But, if you weren't there... then the main family's blood-line would disappear... And what would happen then...?
Maya:
... ...The branch family... My aunt...
Phoenix:
...No, Morgan's spiritual power is too weak. The next person would be... Pearls.
Maya:
...Aaaah!
Phoenix:
Everything was done for her sake. It was all so that Pearls would become the next Master.
Maya:
Y-Yeah... I can see that... ...
Phoenix:
(...? Did Maya say something just now...? I think that she was saying... "I thought so"...)

Look, this whole thing is over now, so let's not dwell on the past, OK?

Yeah... Thanks, Nick.

...My... precious Pearl... You are the only one suitable to be the Master of Kurain, dear child. I sacrificed it all... All for you... I helped that brainless nurse carry out her murder, and cooperated with that whip-happy prosecutor... It was all to unseat that annoying, witless main family girl... That Maya Fey. ...But I shall be patient, my dearest Pearl... A chance will present itself... Your time will come...
Episode 2: Reunion,and TurnaboutTHE END
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maya Fey...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
Game over
