Phoenix:
(What do I do now...? I can't believe Maya and I were actually found guilty...)
Judge:
This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey...  ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright...
Guilty
Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Ahlbi:
M-M-M-Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Ahlbi!
Ahlbi:
I saw the whole trial! What's going to happen to Miss Maya now?
Phoenix:
...I'm worried about that, too. But right now...
Bailiff:
I have one more thing to report, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi!
Nahyuta:
Yes?
Bailiff:
This dagger... It bears the fingerprints of Maya Fey on it!
Phoenix:
Right now, I need to focus on the next trial.
Ahlbi:
The murder of Acolyte Zeh'lot, right?
Phoenix:
At least the jury is still out on that one, so to speak. (The two murders are most likely connected. If I can get to the bottom of Acolyte Zeh'lot's murder... ...it might give me the ammunition I need to overturn Maya's guilty verdict.)
Ahlbi:
Let me help you investigate! I want to assist you any way I can!
Phoenix:
I appreciate it, Ahlbi, but we're talking about a murder.
Ahlbi:
Yeah, but it's going to be hard for a foreigner to investigate this on his own!
Phoenix:
You have a point there.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I wish I knew what to do.)
Rayfa:
.....................
Phoenix:
(Hm? Isn't that...?) ...Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
...............
Phoenix:
Um, Princess Rayfa?
Rayfa:
Hm? ...Oh, it is you again. ...The dead lawyer walking, guilty of abetting a murderer under the Defense Culpability Act.
Phoenix:
Urk! (I see she hasn't lost any of her charm.)
Rayfa:
...........................
Phoenix:
Why the long face? I thought you'd be glad I was found guilty under the DC Act.
Rayfa:
...Hmph. I am in no mood to take joy in your suffering. For I was unable to defeat you, and had to leave the job to others. I failed in my sacred duty as the royal priestess.
Phoenix:
I guess that answers my question.)
Rayfa:
Have I misunderstood... the voice of the mitamah... yet again? ...Th-This--! This cannot be!
Rayfa:
..................
Phoenix:
(All I did was defend my client... Nngh... I can't bear to see her looking so sad like this, though...) ...Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
..................
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence!
Rayfa:
Hm? Oh, Barbed Head. I thought you had already begun your journey to the Twilight Realm.
Phoenix:
I'm not dead yet! I still have an investigation to do... for tomorrow's trial.
Rayfa:
What's this?! D-Do you mean to say... ...you have not given up yet?
Phoenix:
That's right. I'm going to prove Maya innocent tomorrow.
Rayfa:
............ But why? Why do you refuse to give up? I cannot fathom such obstinacy. Investigate all you want -- I care not!
Phoenix:
...You really don't mind? But aren't you worried that a lawyer backed into a corner by the DC Act... ...might do something desperate, like forge evidence?
Rayfa:
What's this?!
Phoenix:
If left unsupervised, I'd be free to do whatever I wanted, you know.
Rayfa:
............Grrr!
Phoenix:
(Okay, now to see if she takes the bait.)
Rayfa:
Yes... I see your point. Barbed Head...
Phoenix:
Yes?
Rayfa:
I know what happened yesterday. You perpetrated some sort of fraud or other misdeed while I was not watching!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Rayfa:
That explains why I misunderstood the voice of the high priest's soul! Yes, of course! That is the only explanation!
Phoenix:
............ (I was just trying to cheer her up. Now she thinks even less of me.)
Rayfa:
I must not allow you to sully our sacred Hall of Justice with your misdeeds ever again. Therefore, today, I will be monitoring your every move once more! I will not fail to spot your misdeeds this time! The moment I see anything out of the ordinary, I will send you straight to prison. And you, boy. Do not throw your lot in with this foreign devil.
Ahlbi:
...B-But... Your Benevolence!
Phoenix:
It's okay, Ahlbi. You don't need to worry about me. I'll be back before you know it. (But first, I should probably lighten my load a bit.) Ahlbi, would you mind holding on to some evidence for me?
Ahlbi:
Of course not! I'm always glad to help!
Unnecessary evidence unloaded onto Ahlbi.
Ahlbi:
May the Holy Mother's blessings be upon you!
Phoenix:
(Now then... The scene of the crime is the logical place to start. If I recall correctly, the body was found at the Plaza of Devotion.)
Talk
Any ideas?
Rayfa:
That boy has grown far too close to you. He will require re-education if he persists in befriending lawyers.
Phoenix:
Re-education? What exactly does that entail?
Rayfa:
First, he must meditate upon Lady Kee'ra for forty-eight hours in the prayer pose.
Phoenix:
How is that re-education? It sounds more like torture to me.
What to do
Rayfa:
Barbed Head! You have an investigation to conduct, do you not?! Get on with it!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, but... (Why does she always have to be like this?)
Rayfa:
What? Would you have preferred that tour guide boy tag along instead?
Phoenix:
Huh?! Oh, umm...
Rayfa:
Hmph, it would appear I have read your mind most accurately.
Phoenix:
(That smile of hers is downright scary.)
Bazaar
Examine
Bird
RAWWWRRR!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaah! What the heck was that?!
Rayfa:
Honestly, what sort of grown man jumps at the call of a warbaa'd?
Phoenix:
What? That roar came from this bird? ...I-It is a bird, right?
Rayfa:
W-Well... give me a moment! ...Nayna! The warbaa'd has many natural enemies. Therefore, it mimics a lion's roar in order to scare them away. But you did not know that, did you? And you call yourself a lawyer! Hmph!
Phoenix:
You didn't know, either, until you asked Nayna.
Rayfa:
Enough! You... You... lamebrain!
Yak
Rayfa:
Have you never seen a yak before, Barbed Head?
Phoenix:
Only in zoos.
Rayfa:
Well in Khura'in, they play an important part in our daily lives. Therefore, they must be treated with kindness and with respect.
MOOOOOOOOO!
Rayfa:
H-Hey! What are doing?! I command you to cease that at once!
Phoenix:
(Wow... That yak is really licking and nuzzling the daylights out of Rayfa...)
Rayfa:
Foul beast! You have made a mess of my royal raiment! For that, I shall make a leather coat out of you later!
Phoenix:
What was that about treating them with "kindness and respect" again...?
Cart
Rayfa:
Why, this giah'pam looks positively delicious. I think I shall take this one.
Phoenix:
Y-Your Benevolence! You can't just take things without paying!
Rayfa:
Shopkeeper! You will receive your payment from this barb-headed foreigner.
Lady:
Thank you, barb-headed foreigner.
Phoenix:
Peasants paying for princesses? This place is absolutely feudal.
Poster
Phoenix:
(It's a poster... That's the Plumed Punisher, Khura'in's famous action hero. I guess we're not the only country with superheroes like that.)
Steaming buns
Rayfa:
........................
*groooowl*...
Phoenix:
...Was that your stomach?
Rayfa:
N-No! Th-That was not me!
*groooowl*...
Rayfa:
Th-That... was the cry of the warbaa'd!
Phoenix:
Would you like a magatah'man?
Rayfa:
Enough! I am not hungry!
Phoenix:
(Why can't some people just admit when they're hungry?)
May 11Plaza of Devotion
Phoenix:
Looks like the police already finished their investigation. (To think someone would be killed here --  a place devoted to prayer. A body outline and... flowers? Did someone leave them here in memory of the deceased? Hm? And there's something different about the prayer flags today...)
Rayfa: 
As the high priest's disciple, Acolyte Zeh'lot was utterly devoted to his training. First the high priest, and now his devoted disciple... Maya Fey will pay for this!
Phoenix:
As I keep trying to tell you, Maya has nothing to do with any of this!
Rayfa:
And you can prove this... how?!
Phoenix:
What do you think I'm doing here?! Gathering dirt and dust for the trial?!
Rayfa:
You and your smart mouth! This is precisely why you and your lawyerly ilk are so reviled.
???:
Hey, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Ema!
Rayfa:
It's that detective from your country again...
Ema:
Eep, it's the princess!
Rayfa:
You seem displeased that I am here.
Ema:
Oh, n-no, no! Don't be silly! Mr. Wright? I'm, uhh... I'm so sorry about what happened to Maya.
Phoenix:
It's not your fault, Ema. You were just doing your job. And if I had just done mine...
Ema:
Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
...But it's no use crying over spilled milk! Would you mind telling me what you know about the murder? It's do or die in court tomorrow. And I mean that literally.
Ema:
Gladly. I'll help in any way I can!
Rayfa:
Remember, I have my eyes on the both of you, so see to it that you commit no misdeeds.
Ema:
Of course not! Hmph, you're talking to a professional here.
Examine
Body outline
Phoenix:
Acolyte Zeh'lot died bent over in prayer. There's no trace of blood on the ground, though... The fact that there's so little bleeding could mean it was a single stab to a vital point. ...Not that that would've been very difficult, considering the position he was in.
Prayer rug
Phoenix:
Acolyte Zeh'lot was killed in a prayer pose. With his head bent over like that, the last thing he saw must've been this rug.
Rayfa:
It is a prayer rug woven by devout monks. May the Holy Mother's blessing be upon his departed soul.
Phoenix:
It's strange that there are no bloodstains, though...
Rayfa:
Hmm... Perhaps it was so cold, his blood froze. Or perhaps it was absorbed by his vestment.
Phoenix:
(It IS pretty cold. Maybe the blood really did just freeze inside his body.)
Flowers
Phoenix:
So these flowers were left here in memory of Acolyte Zeh'lot? What are they called?
Rayfa:
They are known as nahmanda, and they are given to express sorrow when a life is lost.
Phoenix:
It seems offering flowers in memory of the dead is a universal practice.
Nahmanda Flower added to the Court Record.
Purple prayer flag
Phoenix:
This prayer flag looks much newer than the rest. Umm, Your Benevolence? What does it say here?
Rayfa:
The dearest wishes of our subjects are written upon these prayer flags. Reading the prayers of others is considered rude, but if you must know... ...it says, "At the usual spot. Bring grub. The key, too." Hmm,  that is one of the more direct and practical prayers I have ever seen.
Phoenix:
...I wonder if it's even a prayer.
Brand New Flag added to the Court Record.
Talk
The incident
Phoenix:
Let's see... How about starting with an overview of what happened.
Ema:
Sure. The victim is Puhray Zeh'lot. He was the high priest's disciple. His body was discovered around noon today... ...right after the rite wrapped up.
Phoenix:
So, during the high priest's murder trial.
Ema:
That's right. Apparently, he had been here praying since the day before the rite even started. Talk about serious devotion.
Phoenix:
(Yeah... I barely lasted a few minutes.)
Ema:
This is a picture of Mr. Zeh'lot's body.
Phoenix:
(That dagger in his upper back looks like it would've been particularly painful. Hm? Is that a tattoo on the back of his neck? It's... peach shaped...?)
Ema:
Everyone started leaving when the praying was finally done... ...but the victim remained bent over in prayer. And when they went over to check on him...
Phoenix:
They discovered he was dead, right?
Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) added to the Court Record.
Ema:
Yes. The estimated time of death is May 9, sometime between... ...the start of the rite and the discovery of the high priest's body. In other words, we believe the crime took place during the Purification Rite. And the murder weapon was the same ceremonial dagger that killed the high priest. The prosecution believes Maya came down the stairs after killing the high priest... ...and then stabbed Mr. Zeh'lot with the same dagger.
Phoenix:
(Circumstantial evidence does point to Maya, but...) What about the cause of death?
Ema:
He apparently died instantly from the dagger that was left thrust into his upper back. Here's the autopsy report.
Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Rayfa:
Estimated time of death, you say? How can you know such a thing? I want to know! ...Well, Barbed Head! Out with it!
Ema:
Oh, so the princess of the spirit medium kingdom is interested in forensic science?
Rayfa:
Hmph! I have no interest is science, forensic or otherwise! Nevertheless, I will someday be queen. As such, it would be wise to know what silly things the common folk believe in.
Ema:
Tsk! There's nothing silly about it! I'll have you know, even Prosecutor Sahdmadhi holds forensics in high regard.
Rayfa:
Does he?! Hmm... Perhaps I should not underestimate the power of science. Still, I suppose it is nothing much compared to the Divination Séance.
Ema:
She really doesn't have an adorable bone in her body.
Phoenix:
Ema, I think she's actually interested. Would you mind explaining it to her?
Ema:
...I guess I have to now. ...Okay, there are many ways to estimate the time of death... ...but the most well-known method uses the change in body temperature.
Rayfa:
Interesting...
Ema:
Body temperature drops at a steady rate from the moment a person dies. That means we can tell how long someone's been dead by measuring their temperature.
Rayfa:
Hmm... I see, I see! That was quite enlightening. Barbed Head! Present your forehead now!
Phoenix:
What? Why?
Rayfa:
Hmm... You feel just a little over ninety-five degrees. It seems you are not dead yet.
Phoenix:
Of course I'm not!
Rayfa:
Heh heh. It was but a jest. After all, you're still the dead lawyer walking.
Phoenix:
(I fail to see the humor in any of this.) Were there any witnesses? With so many people here at the plaza, you'd think somebody would've seen something.
Ema:
You'd think so, wouldn't you? But we haven't found a single witness.
Phoenix:
How's that even possible?!
Rayfa:
Because everyone was bent over, utterly devoted to prayer, naturally.
Phoenix:
Oh, right, the back-shattering pose that nearly killed me. Still, you'd think someone would've noticed something.
Ema:
I thought so too, but... ...with the monk's scarf he had on, no one could see the dagger in his upper back. Plus, everyone was so absorbed in prayer, they didn't see or hear anything.
Phoenix:
I can't believe this.
Rayfa:
What you choose to believe is your choice, but the fact remains there were no witnesses. However, there is one piece of irrefutable evidence. ...The dagger.
Ema:
Sadly, yes...
Phoenix:
Argh...
Murder weapon
Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the murder weapon?
Ema:
The killer used the Warbaa'd Dagger, the legendary weapon of Lady Kee'ra. It was discovered impaled in the victim's upper back.
Rayfa:
The accused's fingerprints were found on the dagger, were they not?
Ema:
Y-Yes, they were.
Warbaa'd Dagger added to the Court Record.
Rayfa:
With such irrefutable evidence, there is no questioning the accused's guilt.
Phoenix:
Not so fast. What about a motive? Maya had no reason to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot.
Rayfa:
What do the police think about this matter?
Motive
Phoenix:
Maya had no reason to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot!
Rayfa:
So you say, but let us now hear what the police think about the matter.
Ema:
The police believe Maya is the Lady Kee'ra figure who has been battling the rebels. And since Mr. Zeh'lot was the disciple of the high priest, who turned out to be a rebel...
Rayfa:
He, too, was likely a rebel, and therefore met the same untimely demise as his teacher.
Ema:
...Yes, that is how the police currently view this crime.
Phoenix:
There's no way Maya is that Lady Kee'ra vigilante!
Ema:
I agree on a personal level, but the police are just going with what today's trial concluded.
Phoenix:
Ngrk! (I really blew it in court today.)
Present
Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report
Ema:
Based on the estimated time of death, we believe he was killed during the rite itself. It appears he was stabbed in the upper back with a dagger and died instantly.
Phoenix:
But there were so many people here. How could no one have noticed?
Ema:
I know. I can't believe it, either. I guess they were just that focused on their prayers or something.
Warbaa'd Dagger
Ema:
Maya's fingerprints were found on the dagger that was used in the murder. The police are, therefore, investigating her as their prime suspect.
Rayfa:
The evidence is irrefutable, with no room for argument.
Ema:
I really don't want to treat Maya as a suspect, but... ...based on the evidence and police reports I've received so far, it's not looking good.
Phoenix:
(Not good? More like, how could it get any worse?)
If Plaza of Devotion was investigated before High Priest's House
Phoenix:
That message on the prayer flag seems a little weird, but... ...I think I've seen everything there is to see around here.
Rayfa:
You have not found or heard anything of particular worth. Are you ready to give up?
Phoenix:
No, I'm not calling it quits yet!
Ema:
...D-Does it look like you have any hope of winning, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Ema... I can't really say at this point. All I know is I have to keep investigating.
Rayfa:
What are you two sneaks up to? I would advise you to get back to work if you are done here, Detective. Otherwise, I will report you to Prosecutor Sahdmadhi for dereliction of duty.
Ema:
I-I-I, I'm going, I'm going! Well, see you later, Mr. Wright. And good luck!
Phoenix:
(I should really pay a visit to everyone and every place connected with this case.)
If Plaza of Devotion was investigated after High Priest's House
That message on the prayer flag seems a little weird, but... ...I'm not sure it's related to this case.
Rayfa:
We have paid a visit to all of the people and places connected with this case. I think it is about time you prepared yourself for the inevitable. Don't you?
Ema:
...D-Does it look like you have any hope of winning, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Ema... I can't really say at this point. All I know is I have to keep investigating.
Rayfa:
What are you two sneaks up to? I would advise you to get back to work if you are done here, Detective. Otherwise, I will report you to Prosecutor Sahdmadhi for dereliction of duty.
Ema:
I-I-I, I'm going, I'm going! Well, see you later, Mr. Wright. And good luck!
Rayfa:
Well, Barbed Head? Is it not time to give up?
Phoenix:
No, there is still someone I need to talk to first.
May 11High Priest's House
Phoenix:
Hello. I'm sorry to bother you again, but...
Beh'leeb:
Oh, it's you.
Rayfa:
Barbed Head! You are not contemplating casting suspicion upon Lady Beh'leeb, are you? She lost her beloved husband, and now Acolyte Zeh'lot, who was like a son to her.
Phoenix:
Of course, I'm not. But since she was close to both victims, I wanted to hear what she has to say.
Rayfa:
...Very well.
Phoenix:
(And then there's the fact that Lady Kee'ra didn't attack Mrs. Inmee. That probably means she isn't a rebel.)
Beh'leeb:
Is this about poor Puhray? Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think I can talk about that right now. ...B-But what about Maya? She's innocent.
Beh'leeb:
Maya? I heard she was found guilty. First, my dear husband, and now Puhray?
Phoenix:
Mrs. Inmee, you don't really believe that Maya is the killer, do you?
Beh'leeb:
I-I... I don't know. But that was the verdict, so what else can I believe? What am I to do?
Phoenix:
The verdict was already reached in your husband's case... ...but the truth of the matter is yet to be found!
Beh'leeb:
How can you be so sure?
Phoenix:
...Because I believe that Maya is innocent. That is all I have right now -- my faith in her. So please. Help me understand what happened.
Beh'leeb:
So you're... you're defending her based solely on faith? Even though you'll be punished for abetting the accused?
Phoenix:
That's right.
Beh'leeb:
...A-All right, then. Your faith has moved me. I will tell you what I can.
Rayfa:
A-Are you sure about this, Lady Beh'leeb?
Beh'leeb:
"My lovely wife is also a devout follower of Khura'inism. As such, she is not one to make light of another's faith. But if I find that you have lied about your faith in Maya Fey's innocence... ...I shall curse your entire family and all your disciples for the next eight generations."
Phoenix:
(Hey! Leave Athena and Apollo alone, buddy!)
Examine
Photo
Phoenix:
A photo of the high priest, his wife, Acolyte Zeh'lot, and Maya... Since Maya's in it... ...it must've been taken the day before the rite. I should ask Mrs. Inmee about it.
Family Photo added to the Court Record.
Rayfa:
To think that this would be their final family photo... That no-good Maya Fey has some nerve. I mean, here she is posing with the two men whom she would soon kill.
Phoenix:
I beg to differ. I see this photo as proof that she didn't kill them.
Rayfa:
Hmph.That smile of hers does not fool me. I sense a deep and abiding malice behind it.
Phoenix:
(I'll prove Maya's smile is the real deal!)
Photo (after presenting Family Photo)
Phoenix:
It's that family photo they took. Mrs. Inmee said it was taken the day before the rite. I don't suppose any of them could've possibly imagined what was to come...
Talk
Puhray Zeh'lot
Phoenix:
How did Acolyte Zeh'lot end up living here as your husband's disciple?
Beh'leeb:
About two years ago, while my husband was at a spiritual retreat in the mountains... ...he came across Puhray collapsed on the ground. That's when he brought him here. You were always one to help those in need, weren't you, dear?
Phoenix:
...And he'd been living here ever since? (About two years ago... That's around the same time Maya arrived in Khura'in.)
Beh'leeb:
Yes, he was born in a poor village and had nowhere to call home. My husband felt pity for the boy, so he took him in as his disciple. ...But not only as his disciple. He was like a member of our family, too.
Phoenix:
I see. (If this is where Acolyte Zeh'lot lived... ...there might be something I could learn about him lying around here.)
The day before
Beh'leeb:
This photo was taken during the Feast of Blessings.
Phoenix:
The Feast of Blessings?
Beh'leeb:
Yes. It is forbidden to eat during the days of the rite, so the day before it's performed... ...we enjoyed dishes full of gingihl, an herb known to strengthen the body and mind. You loved the gingihl-based dishes I make, didn't you, dear?
Phoenix:
Gingihl... I heard you can go three days without sleeping after eating some.
Beh'leeb:
Yes, but many foreigners don't care for it because of its strong smell.
Beh'leeb:
Our customs say that these dishes can only be eaten the day before the Purification Rite... ...and only between noon and 3 PM.
Phoenix:
That's pretty specific. Is it because the smell is too strong?
Beh'leeb:
A very good guess, indeed. It is to ensure the smell is gone by the time Lady Kee'ra is welcomed the next day.
Phoenix:
Wow, is it really that strong? (Come to think of it, the evening before the murder... ...an overwhelming odor was all over town. It was like a cross between garlic and mint.)
Beh'leeb:
After the Feast of Blessings, Puhray went over to the plaza to begin his supplication. I never thought that would be the last time I would see him.
Phoenix:
What was Maya doing at the time?
Beh'leeb:
Shortly after Puhray left, she went to the temple to prepare for the rite. ...I don't know what she did after that.
Beh'leeb's Statement added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
So, Acolyte Zeh'lot went out to pray the afternoon before the rite? (According to the newspaper... ...on the day before the rite, the plaza was so cold, the whole place had iced over.)
Beh'leeb:
Puhray always prayed a lot -- far more than anyone I have ever known. He was a devout young man whose faith was twice as strong as others.
Phoenix:
(I don't know why, but that's... kinda intimidating to me...)
Present
Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) or Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report
Beh'leeb:
Oh, poor Puhray. He has joined my husband in the Twilight Realm. He was so full of life before he went out to the plaza.
Rayfa:
This must be most difficult for you. It is like losing a family member.
Beh'leeb:
What's that, dear? ...Yes, you're right. I don't know what would've become of me if my husband were not here by my side.
Phoenix:
Umm... Is there anything you can tell me about Acolyte Zeh'lot that might help?
Rayfa:
He was a kindly young man. Let us leave it at that.
Family Photo
Phoenix:
Can I ask you about this photo?
Beh'leeb:
It was taken during the Feast of Blessings, the day before the rite was held.
Phoenix:
The Feast of Blessings? Would you mind telling me a little more about it?
If High Priest's House was investigated before Plaza of Devotion
Phoenix:
(I thought I'd have made some progress by now. But I haven't come across any particularly insightful information, even here.)
Rayfa:
You seem disappointed.
Phoenix:
Mrs. Inmee, is there anything else you could tell me?
Beh'leeb:
Forgive me. But if I keep thinking about those two any longer...
Rayfa:
Barbed Head...
Phoenix:
Yes, I understand. Thank you for your help. I'm sorry to have troubled you.
Rayfa:
You have not found or heard anything of particular worth. Are you ready to give up?
Phoenix:
No, I'm not calling it quits yet!

Present
Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) or Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report
Rayfa:
Ah, the second murder victim.
Phoenix:
Did you know Acolyte Zeh'lot, too, Your Benevolence?
Rayfa:
I knew of him. I know he had been living under the care of Abbot Inmee at his home, but little else.
Phoenix:
You mean like how they're letting me stay at the temple?
Rayfa:
Are you seriously trying to insult the poor victim with your comparison, you filthy dog?
Phoenix:
(Hey! What was THAT comparison for?!)
Warbaa'd Dagger
Rayfa:
That is the sacred dagger used in the Purification Rite. In using it for murder, the vile criminal known as Maya Fey shall be cursed for all eternity.
Phoenix:
Nothing's been proven yet, so stop treating her like a criminal!
Rayfa:
How do explain the accused's fingerprints all over the dagger, then? And the fact that Abbot Inmee was slain with this very weapon?
Phoenix:
(I-I hate it when I have no comeback...!)
May 11Detention Center
Maya:
...............
Phoenix:
(Maya sure looks tired.)
Phoenix:
I'm so sorry, Maya. I failed to defend you during that trial earlier today.
Maya:
I'm sorry, too, Nick. I never meant to get caught up in this whole mess. Even worse, I got you caught up in it, too, and you were convicted under that stupid law. Nick... You should really withdraw from this 
case. Maybe they'll even commute your sentence if you do!
Phoenix:
I-I could never abandon you like that! You might not believe me, but I'm going to pull off a win somehow.
Maya:
It's not like I don't believe in you, it's just...
Phoenix:
Don't worry. Maybe this extra day in court is a blessing from the Holy Mother. Let's use it to our advantage. We'll turn this trial inside-out and upside-down! You'll see!
Maya:
O-Okay...
Rayfa:
.....................
Phoenix:
You're awfully quiet, Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
It is only a matter of time until your executions are carried out. I simply thought I would allow you two a good talk before you depart from this world.
Phoenix:
Sorry, but we're not giving up yet. And we won't till the bitter end.
Rayfa:
There is no need to put on a brave face. Your fates were sealed with today's verdict. Worry not of Maya Fey. The Twilight Realm will cleanse the taint from that neophyte practitioner's soul. Then, perhaps, the Holy Mother may finally forgive her.
Maya:
...............
Phoenix:
(Wait... Was that her attempt at comforting me?)
Rayfa:
Barbed Head, further resistance shall come to naught. Stop your desperate struggle. Accept the judgment that has been passed upon you.
Phoenix:
(She obviously doesn't know me very well.)
Rayfa:
Then, perhaps, your sentence will be commuted, and--
Maya:
Hold it right there, Your Benevolence. Why do you always have to be like that?
Phoenix:
M-Maya,what are you...
Rayfa:
Wh-What is the matter? I was simply showing some mercy upon your souls.
Maya:
Nick here is risking his life to defend me.
Rayfa:
And that is why I told you it will come to nau--
Maya:
No, it won't! Nick is just doing what lawyers are supposed to! He's defending his client, no matter what!
Rayfa:
Enough! There is no place for lawyers in the Hall of Justice! For we have the Divination Séance!
Maya:
But your Insights were wrong!
Rayfa:
Nnngrrrr...
Phoenix:
(Ooh boy, that's gotta hurt.)
Maya:
Don't you get it? Errors are bound to happen if your Insights are accepted without question. So I ask you, royal priestess: What is your true duty? Do the victims' souls or the Holy Mother herself wish you to judge people in error?
Rayfa:
Oooooh... You dare bring Her Holiness's name into this?! You know nothing, you... you... phony baloney!
Phoenix:
P-Please, you two! Enough already!
Maya:
S-Sorry, Nick. I got a little carried away. That's not really like me, huh? Aha ha ha.
Phoenix:
No,I should be thanking you, Maya. It's good to have you in my corner.
Rayfa:
Hrrnh... How dare you mock me so! You will not get away with this! I was a fool to show you compassion. And to think I could convince you to accept your fate. So struggle all you want in the Hall of Justice tomorrow. You will receive your just desserts, as the scorn of our kingdom is heaped upon you!
Phoenix:
(...I can see straight through that contorted smile on your face, you know. *sigh* She may say these terrible things... ...but it's just the way she was raised, I 
guess.)
Examine
Bell
Maya:
A guard will come running if you ring that bell there.
Phoenix:
Really? Let's put that to the test, shall we?
*jingle, jingle*
Maya:
Oh, but they got really mad last time when I rang it for no reason.
Phoenix:
You could've told me that before I rang it!
Talk
Zeh'lot's murder
Phoenix:
Could you try to remember what happened one more time?
Maya:
I've been trying as hard as I can... But I can't remember anything from the middle of the rite onward.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. You suddenly felt sleepy, and everything after that's a blank.
Maya:
Even so, I didn't kill anyone! And I'm not the one going around dressed like Lady Kee'ra! ...Although it's kind of cool to think there's a mysterious female vigilante out there.
Phoenix:
R-Right...
Puhray Zeh'lot
Phoenix:
Were you close to Acolyte Zeh'lot?
Maya:
Umm... We met several times during the meetings about the rite. But I didn't know him very well. He seemed pretty quiet.
Phoenix:
Didn't you eat together the day before the rite?
Maya:
Yeah! We ate this one super-stinky dish, but it was actually really good!I wasn't sure I'd like it, but it was love at first bite! Like... You know the salty noodles at Eldoon's Noodles? It's like if you added garlic and herbs to that,and then let it simmer for a really long time.
Phoenix:
(Sounds more like a hot pot than ramen to me at that point...)
Maya:
*sigh* Now I miss ramen, too...
Phoenix:
Umm... so what was Acolyte Zeh'lot like while you were eating?
Maya:
...He seemed to be enjoying the food. But as soon as we were done, he left to go pray.
Phoenix:
And what did you do? Oh, umm... I returned to the temple to prepare for the rite.
Phoenix:
(That coincides with Mrs. Inmee's description of events.)
Lady Kee'ra's identity (appears after Puhray Zeh'lot)
Phoenix:
Any idea who might be pretending to be Lady Kee'ra?
Maya:
Hmm... When the rite started, it was just me and Abbot Inmee.
Phoenix:
But the Séance vision showed a third figure who looked like Lady Kee'ra.
Maya:
I know... *sigh* Lady Kee'ra... I wish I could've seen her in the flesh.
Phoenix:
Umm, yeah... (Let's stay focused on the case, shall we?) It was supposed to have been impossible for a third party to enter the Inner Sanctum.
Maya:
Ah! But what if she came from the sky? You know, like that bushy-bearded paratrooper! That mountain would've been no match for Lady Kee'ra's wings!
Phoenix:
That's from the Plumed Punisher TV show, right?
Maya:
H-How'd you know?
Phoenix:
Because the real Lady Kee'ra doesn't have wings.
Maya:
Ooh! I've got it this time! There must be a secret room with a secret door at the Inner Sanctum! Did you know there are eighty-eight secret Plumed Punisher bases here in Khura'in?
Phoenix:
Can we please stop talking about the Plumed Punisher show for a sec, Maya?
Maya:
I guess so. *sigh* Keeping it real is much harder than it looks.
Present
Plumed Punisher Strap
Maya:
It's my Plumed Punisher strap! There's only one of them in the entire world! I'll treasure it for the rest of my life!
Phoenix:
.........Your Benevolence? I can't help but notice how hard you're staring at this strap.
Rayfa:
M-Me?! Want that?! Sorry, but you are sorely mistaken!
Maya:
Hey, Your Benevolence? Would you let me out of here in exchange for the strap?
Rayfa:
....................................... ...What a preposterous idea!
Phoenix:
(It didn't stop you from entertaining it, though, did it?)
Lady Kee'ra's Warning
Maya:
Nick, I'm not the one going around impersonating Lady Kee'ra.
Phoenix:
I know, Maya. I believe you.
Rayfa:
Oh, please. Dispense with this bungling act.
Phoenix:
I'm going to prove that Maya isn't Lady Kee'ra.
Rayfa:
Why bother? She is already as good as guilty. And floundering about will not change that fact.
Phoenix:
I don't care. I'll keep fighting until the very last crack of His Magistry's gavel!
Rayfa:
Hmph. You truly are...a nincompoop.
Crime Photo (Zeh'lot) or Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report
Maya:
First Abbot Inmee,and now Acolyte Zeh'lot...
Rayfa:
Spare me your crocodile tears. We both know it was YOU who slew those pious men!
Maya:
N-No, it wasn't me! Nick... How can we make her understand?
Phoenix:
Probably only by getting to the bottom of things in court tomorrow...
Warbaa'd Dagger
Maya:
I can't believe the sacred dagger was used in a murder.
Rayfa:
Only a truly irreverent individual would dare do such a thing. And it was your fingerprints that were found upon the weapon. How do you explain that?
Maya:
I used the dagger during our rehearsals! That's why it has my fingerprints on it.
Rayfa:
And how do I know you are not lying?
Maya:
Ugh... Why won't you believe me?
Phoenix:
Just let it go, Maya. There's no changing her mind right now...
Family Photo
Maya:
We took this picture during the Feast of Blessings... ...before all of these unthinkably tragic things happened...
Rayfa:
Unthinkable? I doubt that. You were surely plotting your murderous rampage at the time.
Maya:
I was thinking of nothing of the sort -- especially not during that meal! The smell of gingihl was so strong, I couldn't think of anything else.
Rayfa:
Yes, well, it IS a rather intense aroma...
Phoenix:
(Wow... Do I even want to know how strong of a smell gingihl gives off up close...?)
After clearing all Talk options:
Phoenix:
Well, I should get going now.
Maya:
...Sorry I wasn't any help.
Phoenix:
Don't worry. I've got this. We'll beat the charges tomorrow and be on the first plane back home before you know it. Then we'll go grab dinner at Eldoon's, or your favorite burger joint! You pick!
Maya:
...Sounds good! I think I'll get the extra-large Hamburg steak topping on my salty bowl! Best of both worlds!
Phoenix:
You can have whatever you like! (But first, I have to beat the charges.)
Maya:
Ah! I almost forgot!
Phoenix:
Ack! Wh-What is it?
Maya:
I have a favor to ask.
Phoenix:
Okay... But why are we whispering?
Maya:
I forgot I left something at the high priest's house. It's super important! Would you mind getting and holding on to it for me?
Phoenix:
Sure. So what's this super important thing?
Maya:
In my bag, you'll find a folding book. It's only given to the priestess who performs the rite. It's called the Tome of Secrets.
Phoenix:
That does sound important. How could you leave something like that just lying around? (That explains all the whispering. If Rayfa found out, all heck would break loose.)
Maya:
Look, it's got Lady Kee'ra's real name written in it, so... Oops! Don't tell anyone I told you that! In fact, just forget I said anything at all! It's supposed to be a secret!
Phoenix:
The Tome of Secrets contains... secrets? Imagine that.
Rayfa:
Hm? What are you two whispering about?
Phoenix:
Oh, um, n-nothing. It's just she forgot something, so I told her I'd go get it.
Rayfa:
...You are up to something, I just know it.
Maya:
Thanks, Nick! I'm counting on you!
Tehm'pul Temple
Talk
Any ideas?
Rayfa:
So, are you ready to give up, Barbed Head? Any more of this and you will cause Lady Inmee to suffer more than she already is.
Phoenix: 
I understand what you mean, but I can't give up that easily. After all, I have to defend Maya in court.
Rayfa:
Stubborn fool. ...But you have already been found guilty. If you wish to continue floundering about, I suppose now is your last chance.
Phoenix:
I'll take every chance I can get.
What to do
Rayfa:
What? Have you given up already?
Phoenix:
Not even close! Still, it does feel like I'm barely treading water over here.
Rayfa:
Water? Do all the people of your country go for a swim when they are troubled? If so, seek the rivers on the edge of town. There you will find all the water you need. Go ahead, paddle to your heart's content!
Phoenix:
(English idioms go right over her head.)
May 11High Priest's House
Phoenix:
Hello? Anybody home? No answer... Mrs. Inmee's probably out right now. Well, I'll just get what I came for.
Rayfa:
I am watching you like a warbaa'd, Barbed Head! You had better not steal anything!
Phoenix:
I would never do something like that! I'm just here to get what Maya asked for!
Rayfa:
Then get on with it. I would if you'd stop interrupting me...
Examine
Bag
Phoenix:
(Ah, here's Maya's bag.)
Rayfa:
Hm? What is that strange patch on her bag?
Phoenix:
It's the Steel Samurai. He's the hero of an action-hero show back in my country. It's actually Maya's favorite show. She's got all sorts of merchandise related to it.
Rayfa:
I see... He looks strikingly similar to the Plumed Punisher.
Phoenix:
They are similar, but... (...the Steel Samurai definitely came first.)
Rayfa:
I see... How interesting...
Phoenix:
(Rayfa seems genuinely intrigued. There must a common thread between Plumed Punisher and Steel Samurai fans. Come to think of it... ...didn't Maya mention something about trading with a Plumed Punisher fan? But I digress... I'd better find what she asked me to look for and get going.) Let's see here... This must be that Tome of Secrets that Maya was talking about.
Tome of Secrets added to the Court Record.
Rayfa:
Well, Barbed Head? Are you finished now?
Phoenix:
Hold on a second. The string around it is coming undone... Whoops! Oh...!
Rayfa:
AHHHHH! YOU FOOL! Do not lay eyes upon it! Put it away! Quickly! Before we go blind!
Phoenix:
Relax. My hand just slipped.
Rayfa:
This is the Tome of Secrets! Are you trying to get us cursed?! Lady Kee'ra is liable to swoop down and gouge our eyes out!
Phoenix:
Oh, right. This book is related to Lady Kee'ra, isn't it? Your Benevolence, would you mind if I asked you some questions?
Rayfa:
Hmph...
Examine
Bag
Rayfa:
What is that strange patch on her bag again?
Phoenix:
It's for the Steel Samurai, this action hero back in my country.
Rayfa:
It looks so similar to the Plumed Punisher -- strikingly so. Hmm, I see... "The Steel Samurai"...
Phoenix:
You're actually interested in it, aren't you?
Rayfa:
Wh-Whatever gave you that idea?!
Talk
Tome of Secrets
Rayfa:
This is not something I would normally speak about to an outsider such as you.
Phoenix:
Well, can't you make an exception?!
Rayfa:
If you insist... Nayna! What of this folding book? ...Yes, I see... This very important tome is bestowed upon the priestess in the Purification Rite.
Phoenix:
*gulp* Very important? Wh-What's written inside?
Rayfa:
Yes, yes... Yes, I see... ...Really? Is it all right to reveal that?
Phoenix:
...Um, uhhh... Your Benevolence?
Rayfa:
Patience, patience! The book contains Lady Kee'ra's true name.
Phoenix:
Her true name? Is a name really that important of a secret?
Rayfa:
To a Khura'inist priestess, a person's name is one of the most important things to know.
Lady Kee'ra's real name (appears after Tome of Secrets)
Phoenix:
What's so important about a name?
Rayfa:
Without a name, a priestess's voice will fail to reach a person's mitamah. It is much like trying to send a letter without the recipient's address. A spirit can only be identified once you know the deceased's face and name.
Phoenix:
Oh, I get it. It's like when you see someone in a crowd you recognize, but you don't know their name. It makes it impossible to get their attention.
Rayfa:
Indeed. You must know a spirit's face and true name before you can commune with it. It is the same for Khura'inism's most secret art, one that my mother alone may use.
Phoenix:
The queen has a secret art?
Rayfa:
Hmph, it is something a foreigner such as you could never hope to guess.
Maya:
In Khura'inism, spirit channeling is a secret art that can only be performed by the queen.
Phoenix:
(I should pretend this is all new to me. Besides, I get the feeling she secretly really wants to tell me all about it.)
The queen's secret art (appears after Lady Kee'ra's real name)
Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this secret art of the queen you spoke of?
Rayfa:
Come again?
Phoenix:
Oh, sorry. Maybe we shouldn't talk about this. It IS a secret after all, right?
Rayfa:
It is the secret art of spirit channeling. But I suppose those words are meaningless to you.
Phoenix:
I'm just surprised how willing you are to tell me about it.
Rayfa:
A third-rate lawyer could not channel spirits simply by learning of the technique.
Phoenix:
(Third-rate is a bit harsh. I'd even settle for second.)
Rayfa:
What is it? You have the look of a tentacled hag frog upon your face.
Phoenix:
(What the heck is a tentacled hag frog?!) ...Spirit channeling... That's where a medium lets a spirit possess her body to return to our world, right?
Rayfa:
Well now. I see you have done your homework.
Phoenix:
Oh, I guess I studied a bit. Eh heh.
Rayfa:
With the power of spirit channeling, one can bring back even the most ancient of spirits! It is quite a magnificent power, is it not?
Phoenix:
(I've never seen her eyes light up like this before.) I imagine they're pretty shocked when they come back from ancient times.
Rayfa:
Indeed. A spirit's memory is cut off at the moment of death.
Phoenix:
So even a spirit that is brought back after centuries doesn't sense any gap in time... ...between the moment of its death, and the moment it is channeled?
Rayfa:
Yes, and yet, it clearly recalls all of the memories it had in life. Thus, even heroes and scholars of antiquity can be channeled and directly learned from. Our queens have also used this power to help the rulers of neighboring lands seek counsel. That is why we have never been invaded, and how we have maintained our unique culture.
Phoenix:
So, spirit channeling is a really effective tool for international politics.
Rayfa:
It is, indeed. And that is why only those with the power to channel spirits may rule our kingdom. But of late, there has been an endless influx of illegal immigrants from neighboring lands. The fools come seeking the same great power as my mother.
Phoenix:
Illegal immigrants?
Rayfa:
Yes. It is becoming quite a problem. Some have lost their way in life, and look to Khura'inism for their salvation. Among them are also those of dubious nature, who have been driven from their own lands.
Phoenix:
(Dubious nature... Driven from their own land...Gaspen Payne definitely fit that bill. But they sure weren't treating him like an illegal alien.)
Rayfa's spiritual power (appears after The queen's secret art)
Phoenix:
Can you channel spirits, Your Benevolence?
Rayfa:
I am but the royal priestess. There is still much that I must learn. As of now, the Divination Séance takes me to the very limit of my ability.
Phoenix:
(So, her spiritual power doesn't measure up to Maya's.)
Rayfa:
...You were just mocking me in your mind, weren't you?
Phoenix:
D-Don't be ridiculous!
Rayfa:
It is written all over your face! You... impudent nincompoop! The Divination Séance was once one of the important roles fulfilled by the queen. That is what my mother taught me when I was little.
Phoenix:
(So the queen can perform the Dance of Devotion? That'd be a sight to see.)
Rayfa:
Someday, I will be a powerful priestess and queen, just like my mother. And the Divination Séance is a vital part of my training to prepare me for that day!
Phoenix:
F-Forgive my ignorance, Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
Hmph, you shall see. It will not be long before I, too, master the secret art of spirit channeling! I will be a magnificent queen who unites her people for the greater good of Khura'in!
Phoenix:
(Now I see... Spirit channeling is something she really aspires to.) 
Maya:
I'm going to ace that test and become the next master! After all, I can't let my clan and the other villagers down.
Phoenix:
(It looks like she actually has something in common with Maya.)
Present
Tome of Secrets
Rayfa:
You fool! Why have you put the Tome of Secrets before me?!
Phoenix:
What's the big deal?
Rayfa:
S-Stay back! Come no closer!
Phoenix:
(Hey, this thing's actually pretty useful!) Lookie here, Your Benevolence. It's the Tome of Seeecrets.
Rayfa:
If you do not desist this instant, I shall have you put to death for the crime of blasphemy!
Phoenix:
Urk! S-Sorry! (...If looks could kill, I'd already be dead.)
Move
Rayfa:
Where do you think you are going, Barbed Head?
Rayfa:
Were you not the one who said you wished to speak with me?
Phoenix:
(I better stay here and talk to Rayfa for now.)
Rayfa:
Are you quite through now? There are more important things to do than to stand here and talk about spirit channeling.
Phoenix:
(That's true. It doesn't have anything to do with this case, as far as I can tell. Or does it...?)
Phoenix:
Umm... If the queen is a spirit medium...
Rayfa:
Are you about to suggest that my mother was channeling Lady Kee'ra?
Phoenix:
Ack! 
(I guess she saw that one coming.)
Rayfa:
Hmph, lawyers are indeed a witless breed! On the day of the rite, my mother was engaged in other duties at the palace.
Phoenix:
Of course...
Rayfa:
My mother is a very busy woman. And the idea itself is preposterous. Do you truly believe the queen of Khura'in would personally battle the insurgents? This is precisely what makes you third-rate!
Phoenix:
Urk! (Another dead end! This is bad!) A-Anyway, I need to continue looking for leads, so...
???:
Over there! After him! Don't let him escape!
Rayfa:
What is all that racket? What? That escaped prisoner has surfaced here in town?
Phoenix:
Escaped prisoner? You mean... that guy with the bushy beard?
Rayfa:
There is no reason to panic. The police are on his trail.
Phoenix:
(He's no longer a suspect... But he might know something, considering he was at the scene of the crime.) Let's go take a look!
Rayfa:
Wait!
May 11Khura'in - Bazaar
Phoenix:
*huff* *puff* Oww, my aching back. I forgot how badly I'd injured it. Ow, ow, ow... I need to do some stretching and exercise more when I get back home.
???:
Ah, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
*huff* *puff* ...H-Hey, Ahlbi. Datz... Are'bal... Have you seen hi--
Ahlbi:
A-Are you all right, sir?
Phoenix:
One second... *huff* *puff* *wheeeeeze* Have you seen... that escaped prisoner around here?
Ahlbi:
Oh, so that's why all those police came rushing over here. I heard them saying something about an escaped prisoner disappearing in this area.
Phoenix:
He disappeared in this area? He couldn't have taken to the air again, could he?
Rayfa:
Barbed Head! *huff* *huff* I told you to wait!
Phoenix:
It's too dangerous for you around here, Your Benevolence. Mr. Are'bal could be lurking nearby!
Rayfa:
What sort of a princess would I be if all it took was an escaped prisoner to frighten me?!
Phoenix:
(She's fearless, I'll give her that.) I can't be responsible if something happens to you. (As long as I'm here, though, I might as well search the area myself. Hmm... If I were an escaped prisoner, where would I hide?)

Any ideas?
Rayfa:
That patch on the accused's bag... It is the Steel Samurai?
Phoenix:
Yes. It's a huge hit back in my country.
Rayfa:
I see... It has a rather fine design, I must say. However, it pales beside the Plumed Punisher, of course.
Phoenix:
Of course... 
(They all look the same to me, to be honest...)
What to do
Rayfa:
How dare you leave me behind like that!
Phoenix:
S-Sorry... (It sure was a lot easier without her, though.)
Rayfa:
Do that again and I will levy a penalty on you!
Phoenix:
A penalty? Like what...?
Rayfa:
Like... Oh, I know! You must clean my room.
Phoenix:
Hey, that's not so bad.
Rayfa:
...All thirty of them.
Phoenix:
Forgive me for leaving you behind, Your Benevolence!

Manhole
Phoenix:
That manhole cover... It's open!
Shah'do:
Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff!
Ahlbi:
Whoa! What is it, Shah'do?!
Phoenix:
Did he sniff out someone or something in the manhole? (Hmm, I wonder...) Could Shah'do track Mr. Are'bal if he had something with the rebel's scent on it?
Ahlbi:
I-I don't know...
Phoenix:
(I feel like I've got something with Mr. Are'bal's scent on it... Something he might've touched...)
Talk
Any ideas?
Phoenix:
Have you noticed anything around here?
Ahlbi:
I haven't seen the escaped prisoner. But I did notice how slow you run, sir.
Phoenix:
(It's just the high elevation. I'm out of breath before I know it!)
What to do
Ahlbi:
The police said the escaped prisoner vanished right around here.
Phoenix:
Hmm, there aren't any really good hiding places, so where could he have gone?
Ahlbi:
Maybe he melted into the crowd.
Phoenix:
You should be careful, Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
You need not tell me that! I am not a child, after all!
Phoenix:
Okay, okay...
Present
Plumed Punisher Strap
Ahlbi:
That is THE Plumed Punisher strap. There's only one in the entire world!
Phoenix:
Oh, do you know a lot about the Plumed Punisher?
Ahlbi:
Of course! She's a real hero to the people!
Phoenix:
The ratings for the show must be through the roof.
Ahlbi:
They are! It reached 100 percent viewership at one point!
Phoenix:
One hundred percent?!
Ahlbi:
Well, when there's only one TV channel in the entire kingdom...
Phoenix:
Oh, that explains it.
Warbaa'd Dagger
Ahlbi:
That's the dagger that was used in the rite. It's said that Lady Kee'ra once wielded it. In addition to that dagger, there are many other items that are said to have been hers.
Phoenix:
Really? Like what?
Ahlbi:
There's the obvious stuff, like swords, spears, and other weapons. But there are other, more interesting items, like her favorite hat and her favorite pillow.
Phoenix:
Her pillow...?
Ahlbi:
Yes. They say if you use it, Lady Kee'ra will ensure you have a restful slumber.
Phoenix:
As long as it's not eternal...
Brand New Flag (after examining manhole)

"Here, Shah'do."
Phoenix:
Here, Shah'do. How about this? I hope it works...
Shah'do:
Grrr... Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff!
Phoenix:
I think he's picked up a scent! You mind if I borrow Shah'do for a bit?!
Ahlbi:
By all means! I had no idea you could do this! Yeah! Go get 'im, boy!
Shah'do:
Ruff, ruff, ruff!
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence, I'm heading down the manhole now. It could be dangerous, so please wait here!
Rayfa:
Wait!
Phoenix:
Don't worry, I won't commit any of those misdeeds you're so worried about.
Rayfa:
That is not what I fear! There may be a vicious insurgent lurking down there!
Phoenix:
Oh, are you worried about me?
Rayfa:
No. I was simply wondering why you would go to such lengths in your investigation. After all, if you would simply withdraw from this case, they might commute your sentence.
Phoenix:
I'm doing this to prove Maya innocent.
Rayfa:
But how can you be so sure of the accused's innocence?! She has already been found guilty!
Phoenix:
Don't worry. Maybe this extra day in court is a blessing from the Holy Mother. Let's use it to our advantage. We'll turn this trial inside-out and upside-down! You'll see!
Maya:
O-Okay...
Phoenix:
I believe in her. If she says she's innocent, then that means she's innocent. Lawyers must trust in their clients to the bitter end. That's just what we do.
Rayfa:
......... You...lamebrain. Do what you will!
Phoenix:
Well, I'm going in!
Let's go, Shah'do!
Shah'do:
Ruff, ruff!
Ahlbi:
Be careful!
Shah'do!:
Ruff, ruff!
Phoenix:
W-Wait! Come back here! It's pitch black down here. I can't see a thing.
*WHAM*
Phoenix:
Aaagh!
Phoenix:
Ooogh... Owww owww owwww... What happened? I went down into the manhole, and then...
???:
Oh, ya finally came to?
Phoenix:
Ah! (I'd remember that face anywhere! And that dragon symbol on his armband... That's the mark of the rebels! There can be no mistake! It's him -- Datz Are'bal!) YIKES!
Datz:
Sorry I got a little rough with ya back there. Thought ya were the cops. Why ya making that face? ...Hey, want an apple?
Phoenix:
(Whew...I thought he was going to kill me.) I-I'll pass on the apple, but thanks. (I don't mind a good apple, but not right now.) What is this place?
Datz:
This is the office of my brother in arms, Dhurke! But right now, we're using it as a rebel safe house!
Phoenix:
Wait, back up a sec. What kind of office is this exactly?
Datz:
A law office, what else?!
Phoenix:
Really?! Dhurke used to be a lawyer?!
Datz:
Yep! Just like you!
Phoenix:
(Khura'in's public enemy number one is an ex-lawyer? Didn't see that coming.)
Datz:
But I don't suppose I'll be coming 'round here anymore.
Phoenix:
You won't? Are you planning to flee or something?
Datz:
It's just... I wanna get outta the rebel business. Tired o' being hounded by the cops and all that. So I came by today to pick up the last o' my stuff.
Phoenix:
R-Really...?
Datz:
I'm gonna sell Dhurke's info to the minister o' justice, then slip outta Khura'in!
Phoenix:
...W-Wait a second! You're a key person of interest in this case! You can't go running off like that! 
Datz:
Relax, will ya? I'll tell ya whatever ya need to know. Oh, and sorry about punching your lights out back there. My bad! So, Mr. Lawyer Man, whaddaya wanna know?
Phoenix:
Tell me about the murders of the high priest Tahrust Inmee, and his acolyte Puhray Zeh'lot.
Datz:
Sure, I'll tell ya whatever I can. Don't know if it'll be much help, though. I mean, I'm not a rebel anymore, so...
Phoenix:
(I wonder how true that really is...)
Examine
Picture of Ga'ran
Phoenix:
(There's a knife driven deep into a photo of the queen. I guess the rebels really hate her. I better remember to stay on their good side.)
White flowers
Phoenix:
Incense and white flowers... (The flowers are still fresh. They must've been put here maybe today or yesterday.) Did you put these here, Mr. Are'bal?
Datz:
...Something wrong with flowers?
Phoenix:
Oh, no!
Datz:
It's just a traditional thing here in Khura'in. Pay it no mind.
Ladder
Phoenix:
There's a ladder leading underground. He must've brought me in through there. But there's no reason for me to leave yet. I should see what else Mr. Are'bal has to say.
Photos
Phoenix:
This looks like a photo of Dhurke and his compatriots... And here's one that looks really old... Wow, this was taken about twenty years ago.
Datz:
Those are Dhurke's sons.
Phoenix:
Really? So this is the rebel Dhurke in the center? He doesn't look so evil. And both of his sons... look kind of familiar...
Datz:
The one on the left is Yuty. Oh, but you know him as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.
Phoenix:
P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi is Dhurke's son?!
Datz:
That he is! Yuty was once a rebel, too! He used to really respect his old man... ...both as a father and as a lawyer.
Phoenix:
Then why'd he become a prosecutor?
Datz:
Being a lawyer in this kingdom is the same as signing your own death warrant.
Phoenix:
On account of the Defense Culpability Act, right?
Datz:
Yeah. That's why Yuty decided to be a prosecutor instead. He wanted to spark a revolution from the inside, so he dove right into the enemy's den!
Phoenix:
I would've never guessed it, looking at him now.
Datz:
You can say that again. Dhurke is battling to change Khura'in's legal system. The will of the dragon spurs him on. We all thought Yuty was taking up the mantle to carry on that will, too... We were sure he'd help overthrow Ga'ran one day, but... As you've seen, he now uses the law to do her Dhurke's been beside himself.
Phoenix:
(So he no longer carries the will of the dragon in him, huh... I wonder what happened between father and son for it to come to this?) What about the other child in the photo?
Datz:
That's Dhurke's adopted son, but he's gone back overseas. His name's Apollo.
Phoenix:
(Apollo? Wait a second... That bracelet... It really IS Apollo!)
Datz:
He was a rascal, that one! And his voice could shake the entire room! I imagine he's out there raising high hell somewhere!
Phoenix:
Ha, aha ha... Yes, I'm sure he's doing just fine. (Considering how far he's come, Mr. Are'bal's description really doesn't do Apollo justice!)
Phoenix:
............Apollo! I've been watching you grow over these past two years. That's why I know you're ready, why I know I can leave Trucy and the office to you. ...I believe in you, Apollo.
Apollo:
...Thank you! I'll... I'll be fine! Everything will be fine!
Phoenix:
(He's a responsible young man now. He never lost that loud voice, though.)
Photos (again)
Phoenix:
This looks like a photo of Dhurke and his compatriots... And here's one that's really old...
Datz:
Those are Dhurke's sons. The one on the left is Prosecutor Sahdmadhi when he was younger. I used to call him Yuty. Thought he'd carry on the will of the dragon and become a fine lawyer, but...
Phoenix:
And the other child is...?
Datz:
That's Dhurke's adopted son, but he's gone back overseas. His name's Apollo.
Phoenix:
(That name, and that bracelet... Yep, that has to be our Apollo.)
Datz:
He was a rascal, that one! And his voice could shake the entire room! I imagine he's out there raising high hell somewhere!
Phoenix:
Ha, aha ha... Yes, I'm sure he's doing just fine. (Considering how far he's come, Mr. Are'bal's description really doesn't do Apollo justice!)
Lizards
Phoenix:
What are these hanging here? Lizards? ...If so, they're pretty big.
Datz:
Those're sewer lizards! We call 'em that 'cause they live in the sewer! They grow bigger than your average lizard, which makes 'em fine eating!
Phoenix:
Wait, you eat these?
Datz:
What else would ya do with 'em?! Here, try one!
Phoenix:
Pass! I'll definitely pass!
Datz:
...You're missing out on a fine treat, my man!
Phoenix:
S-Somehow, I think I'll live without it.
Food
Phoenix:
(There are bowls and platters of food here. ...They're still warm, as if this was all recently prepared.) You must have a pretty big appetite, Mr. Are'bal.
Datz:
Har har har har har! Guys as big and strong as me... Got even bigger appetites, y'know!
Phoenix:
But you just fled from the police. I don't know how you could eat this much after all that excitement. Ack! S-Sorry if I offended you!
Datz:
But first, let's start with an apple-tizer!
Phoenix:
(Where's he getting all those apples from?!)
Datz:
Wanna join me, Mr. Lawyer Man? Got plenty of sewer lizards, too!
Phoenix:
T-Thanks, but I already ate.
Coat
Phoenix:
Is that coat yours, Mr. Are'bal?
Datz:
Nah, it belongs to the rebel leader Dhurke.
Phoenix:
It's pretty impressive. I like the color, too.
Datz:
...Wanna try it on?
Phoenix:
Really? You sure it's okay?
Datz:
Of course. Bet it would look great on ya!
Phoenix:
Well then, don't mind if I do... ......... Ack! It smells all moldy!
Datz:
Haaaar har har har har! I can't believe ya fell for it! Haaar haaar! That thing's been hanging there forever!
Phoenix:
(Note to self: Don't trust this guy ever again.)
Sign
Phoenix:
What's this thing with the dragon on it? Some kind of a sign?
Datz:
Yep. That was his business sign back when this was Dhurke's office.
Phoenix:
He used to be a lawyer, right?
Datz:
That he was, but it was a really long time ago. This place has seen better days, that's for sure.
Phoenix:
Well, I hope he can put his sign back up someday.
Datz:
.........I wouldn't hold my breath.
TV or refrigerator
Phoenix:
You guys get electricity?
Datz:
Yeah, but the power goes out occasionally.
Phoenix:
That's pretty inconvenient.
Datz:
You're telling me! Sometimes, it goes out for an entire day.
Phoenix:
What about the stuff in the refrigerator?
Datz:
Why don't you see for yourself?
Phoenix:
Forget I asked! (I'm afraid of what I might find...)
Book
Phoenix:
Is this... a law book? (A dragon mark's been branded into the cover.)
Datz:
That's Dhurke's law book.
Phoenix:
Really?! The leader of the rebels? That Dhurke?
Datz:
That's right. And that "Mark of the Dragon" is the emblem of the rebellion!
Phoenix:
Hmm, the pages in this one section are really dirty.
Datz:
Must be the section on the Defense Culpability Act.
Dhurke's Law Book added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
He must've done a ton of research on the Defense Culpability Act. He practically wore out the entire section.
Talk
The high priest's murder
Phoenix:
Tell me everything you know about the high priest's murder.
Datz:
Uhh... Well, as ya know, I don't remember much about that. I banged my head on a rock as soon as I parachuted into the Inner Sanctum. So when I told you I had nothing to do with his murder, I meant it!
Phoenix:
Okay then, where were you when you came to after banging your head?
Datz:
Uhh... By the time I came to, it was already dawn. I musta been out cold the whole time!
Phoenix:
So you didn't see the crime happen at all...?
Datz:
...Ya got that right!
Phoenix:
Then why did you say you did when you testified?!
Datz:
Oh, uhh... About that... Since I didn't remember a thing... ...I was afraid I'd seem suspicious, o I came up with that whole story!
Phoenix:
(Does he even realize how much trouble his big fat lie has caused me?)
Datz:
Sorry for the trouble! It was definitely my bad!
Phoenix:
(He doesn't seem very sorry to me!) So, the bottom line is you were at the scene of the crime, but weren't involved in it. Got it.
Dhurke the attorney (appears after The high priest's murder)
Phoenix:
So, Dhurke used to be a lawyer?
Datz: 
Yep! He was a force to be reckoned with back when he was still practicing! He was a juggernaut of the law, and as mighty as a dragon! He could strike terror into a prosecutor's heart, just by glaring at him. People called it his "dragon's glare." He even got criminals to confess and pass out with a well-placed glare!
Phoenix:
(You've got to be kidding me...)
Datz:
But most important of all, he would never surrender. He'd fight for the accused, no matter how the odds were stacked against him.
Phoenix:
Is that what you mean by the will of the dragon?
Datz:
Yep, that would be it! Actually... Your work in court yesterday was mighty impressive, too! You didn't give up, no matter how hard of a beating you took! ...Not unlike Dhurke, I might add!
Phoenix:
Oh, um... thanks. (Even if a big part of that beating I took was because of you...)
Present
Anything
Datz:
Is this a parting gift for me leaving the rebels?
Phoenix:
N-No, you can't keep it! (I'll just ask him what I can for now.)
Datz:
Well, I gotta start packing. Who knows when they might catch up with me if I don't scram soon?
Phoenix:
Please, wait! I still need to ask you something.
Datz:
Go ahead, shoot.
Phoenix:
What are you rebels trying to do?
Datz:
..................
Phoenix:
And why were you at the Inner Sanctum in the first place?
Talk
Mr. Are'bal's plan (replaces Dhurke the attorney)
Phoenix:
Why were you at the Inner Sanctum on the day of the murder? Or more precisely, what were you trying to do there?
Datz:
I was trying to escape from prison, that's all. But that high priest was a fool for getting taken in by Dhurke. He shoulda tried hightailing it outta Khura'in like I'm doing!
4 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
Ah... Psyche-Locks! (Mr. Are'bal is hiding something! But I won't know exactly what until I can undo the locks!) What exactly are you trying to hide, Mr. Are'bal?
Datz:
Huh? I'm not hiding anything! No way, no how!
Phoenix:
(...I'll just have to use my magatama on him, then.)
Magatama
Phoenix:
-- Datz's Plan --
4 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
I'm going to ask you again: Why were you at the Inner Sanctum on the day of the murder? Or more precisely, what were you trying to do there?
Datz:
Ya can keep asking, but the answer's still the same. I was trying to escape from prison, that's all. ...But that high priest was a fool. He fell for Dhurke's line and sold his own country out.
Phoenix:
How can you say such things about him?! He helped you escape, didn't he? Don't you even care about what happened to him?
Datz:
Nope. I was getting out of the rebellion, anyway. He should've opened his eyes. We never stood a chance against the Ga'ran regime.
Phoenix:
Hang on. Do you really believe what you're saying? Didn't the high priest's death really hurt you on the inside?
Datz:
Like I just said, I couldn't care less about the whole thing!
Phoenix:
I beg to differ. This wouldn't be here in this room if you didn't feel a thing.
Present Nahmanda Flower
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"I heard these flowers are offered in memory of the dead here in Khura'in."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Datz:
What does that have to do with anything?
Phoenix:
You don't know? Try looking deep into your heart.
Datz:
Umm... I still don't get it. But I'm starting to think you don't, either!
Phoenix:
(Arngh... Why does it feel so much worse when it's him who's pointing out my failures?)
Datz:
I told ya, I couldn't care less about the high priest!
Phoenix:
(Really...? Because I'm pretty sure I have something that points to his grief.)
Leads back to:
"I beg to differ."
Phoenix:
I heard these flowers are offered in memory of the dead here in Khura'in. The high priest's death hit you hard, so you've been grieving here alone, haven't you? Well?
Datz:
Hee-HO!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Datz:
Those flowers don't mean anything. It's just a Khura'inese way o' saying goodbye.
Phoenix:
Why hide the fact that you're mourning his death?
Datz:
You're reading into this too much. I told ya, I'm done with the rebellion! I haven't even heard from Dhurke or the rest of 'em for a few days. And tomorrow, I'm planning to kiss this kingdom goodbye!
Phoenix:
No, I know you've been in contact with the other rebels lately!
Datz:
And how exactly do you plan on proving that?!
Phoenix:
This piece of evidence ties you to the other rebels! 
Present Brand New Flag
Phoenix:

"I found this prayer flag at the Plaza of Devotion."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Datz:

Phoenix:
Cat got your tongue?
Datz:
No, it's just, I was shocked at how off-target ya are. Wait, you're not stalling for time or something, are ya?
Phoenix:
N-No, I'd never do that. (I hope he doesn't think I'm in cahoots with the police or something...)
Datz:
I keep trying to tell ya -- I got nothing to do with the rebels anymore.
Phoenix:
(This food was brought here for Mr. Are'bal after he escaped from prison. So he must've gotten in contact with the other rebels somehow.) No, I know you're still involved with them!
Leads back to:
"This piece of evidence ties you to the other rebels!"
Phoenix:
I found this prayer flag at the Plaza of Devotion. You wrote a message on it, and left it behind for your fellow rebels, didn't you?
Datz:
Gulp!
Phoenix:
They brought this food for you at your request.
Datz:
Hoo-HA HA!
Phoenix:
So you're lying about leaving the rebels. You're still involved with Dhurke and the rest of them, aren't you?
Datz:
Naaaaaaaargh!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Phoenix:
Are you ready to tell me the truth now?
Datz:
Oh, you're good, Mr. Lawyer Man! I admit it! I requested the grub. But I was just taking advantage of 'em, that's all!
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Datz:
With my face plastered all over the place, I couldn't stay out in the open anymore. So, I just took advantage of my former comrades for some grub and a place to hide. I was gonna kiss this kingdom goodbye tomorrow!
Phoenix:
I'm not buying it. You're obviously lying. I can tell just by looking at you. The white-hot flames of revolution definitely still burn on inside of you!
Datz:
What?! That's ridiculous. Those flames burned out a long time ago!
Phoenix:
This proves that the flames of revolution still burn on inside of you!
Present Dhurke's Law Book
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Dhurke's law book?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Datz:
Ah!
Phoenix:
I'm right, aren't I?! That's why you're so shocked!
Datz:
Yeesh, I almost forgot about dessert!
Phoenix:
(I guess that wasn't it.)
Datz:
Would you give up already? The flames of revolution burned out inside of me a long time ago!
Phoenix:
(No, I know they still burn on. Because he's wearing something that proves it!) You can't fool me, Mr. Are'bal.
Leads back to:
"This proves that the flames of revolution still burn on inside of you!"
Datz:
Dhurke's law book? I'm no lawyer, so what's that got to do with me?
Phoenix:
Look at the mark branded onto the cover. This mark that stands for an unwavering commitment to the revolution. It is Dhurke's way of representing the will of the dragon!
Datz:
Yeah? So what of it?!
Phoenix:
You have that same mark on the scarf tied around your left arm. But you wouldn't be wearing that if you were no longer a rebel!
Datz:
I-I... I forgot to take it off, that's all!
Phoenix:
No, as a wanted man, that should've been the first thing you took off! The fact that you haven't hidden that mark yet... proves you're still a rebel!
Datz:
Hoo-HA!

Phoenix:
(I didn't think it was THAT funny...)
Datz:
I was right, you don't know a thing about me!

Actually, I know you wear your beliefs right on your sleeve -- just like me.

"And this is what I believe in."
Datz:

Phoenix:
When a person's back is against a wall, they always fall back on what they believe in. Just as I always have my badge, you always have the will of the dragon with you.
Datz:
And would you risk your life for your beliefs?
Phoenix:
...No, I wouldn't.
Datz:
No?
Phoenix:
No, because I wouldn't be much use to my clients dead. Now, admit it! You've never once thought about leaving the Defiant Dragons, have you!

Mr. Are'bal's plan (after breaking Psyche-Locks)
Datz:
I had planned to take ya out if ya turned out to be on the side of the royals... But I think I can trust ya.
Phoenix:
(I can't believe I was that close to getting shanked here...)
Datz:
It's like ya said. I've no intention of leaving Dhurke's group.
Phoenix:
In other words, you were testing me. You're a foreigner, and a lawyer who's been charged with abetting a criminal to boot. And I've seen a fair share of lawyers get pardoned... ...after weeping at the feet of the queen.
Phoenix:
Well, I'm going to keep fighting till the end.
Datz:
Yeah, I can see that now. Sorry I ever doubted ya.
Phoenix:
So, what are you doing here, anyway?
Datz:
I came to get the secret hideout key from a helper.
Phoenix:
A secret hideout?
Datz:
Yep. I was supposed to get my next order from Dhurke there. But the town's swarming with cops thanks to that murder. Nothing I can do about that.
Phoenix:
What about the order Dhurke was supposed to give you?
Datz:
Gonna have to abort that mission. Now I'm just lying low, waiting for a chance to make contact with Dhurke again. ......... Hey, why the long face?
Phoenix:
I thought you'd be able to tell me something about the high priest's murder.
Datz:
Sorry to disappoint ya... Oh, I know. Lemme make it up to ya with this.
Phoenix:
...What is it?
Datz:
This orb is actually a key. It opens the door to one of our secret hideouts. I can't say any more than that. Anyway, I hope it helps.
Phoenix:
This orb... is a key?
Datz:
Yep! Plus the hideout's in a totally unexpected location! And being that it's super secret, we couldn't have just any ordinary key!
Phoenix:
I see...
Golden Orb added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Maybe this will help me unravel the truth behind this case.
Datz:
Don't mention it! Besides, you're a fellow brother in arms, fighting the powers that be! If it'll help ya, feel free to pick my brain a bit more.
Lady Kee'ra (replaces Mr. Are'bal's plan)
Datz:
Everyone's been talking about the return of Lady Kee'ra lately.
Phoenix:
Well, my friend Maya's suspected of being the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra. You wouldn't happen to know who she really is though, would you?!
Datz:
Beats me. But whoever she is, she bushwhacked me and hauled me off to jail! Even worse, on top o' attacking us and delivering us to the cops... ...she's been watching us like a hawk and framing us for different crimes!
Phoenix:
Watching you like a hawk? Framing you for crimes? Why would anyone go to all that trouble?
Datz:
Our kingdom likes to pretend that its people are free to think what they want. Because of that, the authorities can't arrest ya just for sympathizing with the rebellion. So they resort to framing people for things they didn't do.
Phoenix:
Then that Lady Kee'ra figure is...
Datz:
Yep, she's just some lickspittle working for the Ga'ran regime.
Phoenix:
Wow...
Inga:
Heh, even without the DC Act, Dhurke and his insurgent scum buddies' days are numbered.
Phoenix:
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?!
Inga:
Let's just say... I got a little trick up my sleeve. So I'd watch it if I were you. 'Cause you got a defiant attitude -- like one o' them dragon dupes.
Phoenix:
(So he was talking about Lady Kee'ra, then?)
Datz:
Advanced combat skills, detailed surveillance, and clever set ups... She's no amateur if ya ask me.
Phoenix:
So, you're saying the monarchy is using Lady Kee'ra to secretly take out the rebels?
Datz:
Exactly! The Ga'ran regime is using her to control the people, even down to what we think!
Phoenix:
Why don't the people protest if the monarchy is doing things like that?
Datz:
Unfortunately, we don't have any conclusive evidence. And without that, we can't prove anything.
Phoenix:
Arngh! I know the feeling... If I bring this up in court, they'd probably dismiss it out of hand. (I'll have to unmask Lady Kee'ra if I want to get anywhere.)
Goal of the revolution (appears after Lady Kee'ra)
Datz:
Our goal? To get rid o' that evil, no-good Defense Culpability Act!
Phoenix:
I can tell just by looking at Dhurke's law book.
Datz:
The DC Act has turned this kingdom into a corrupt cesspool... ...where false charges are overlooked, and prosecutors are the only ones heard in court. It's been twenty-three years since it was first enacted.
Phoenix:
What happened twenty-three years ago to make them pass such a terrible law?
Datz:
The assassination of Queen Amara...
Ahlbi:
It happened before I was even born, but... ...Queen Amara -- the previous queen -- was assassinated. And it was the rebel leader Dhurke who did it.
 
Phoenix:
Dhurke assassinated the former queen, didn't he?
Datz:
That's the official line, but...
Phoenix:
The official line?
Datz:
Those charges were completely trumped up! Dhurke was framed, I'm telling ya!
Phoenix:
H-He was?!
Datz:
Plus, Dhurke was a lawyer. Once the people thought a lawyer had killed the queen, they turned against all lawyers. And that's how the DC Act was first passed.
Phoenix:
So, that's why there aren't any lawyers left in Khura'in.
Datz:
Even worse, it changed the significance of the Divination Séance.
Phoenix:
(The significance of the Divination Séance?) They were holding Séances in court, even before the DC Act?
Datz:
You bet they were! Lawyers and prosecutors used to hotly contest the Insights that came outta Séances.
Phoenix:
You mean like what I've been doing?
Datz:
Right! It's like Dhurke used to say: The royal priestess's Insights are just another piece of evidence.
Phoenix:
Right... I see what you mean about the significance of the Divination Séance changing.
Datz:
Yep! The Insights became the only truth, and arguing against them was banned!
Rayfa:
As royal priestess, it is my duty to reveal the truth through the Divination Séance. This time, I will prove that the insights I glean thereof are the very truth itself. Prepare yourself, for this shall be your last trial... and your last rites. Tomorrow shall end with you under the headsman's axe!
Phoenix:
(From what I've seen, Rayfa would agree with that.)
Datz:
This kingdom's a shadow of its former self. It's become a dictatorship where the royals use the fear of trumped-up charges to rule!
Phoenix:
And that's what Dhurke's been rebelling against?
Datz:
Yep. All we want is to live in a kingdom with a fair and impartial legal system. And there's only one way to make that come true: Overthrow the current regime!
Phoenix:
(So, that's the truth behind the rebels.)

Phoenix:
It's always hardest for the family members left behind.
Datz:
I know exactly what you mean. Blast it! If only I could remember what happened after I escaped from prison.
Phoenix:
(It seems Mr. Are'bal feels responsible for the high priest's death.)
Dhurke's Law Book
Datz:
The dragon emblem branded into that book is a sign of defiance against the Ga'ran regime. That evil law's led to the deaths of many of our brothers in arms.
Phoenix:
You mean the Defense Culpability Act?
Datz:
Yep. But we're not gonna stand for it much longer! That's the main reason we have to see this revolution through!
Phoenix:
(I've never seen him so serious before.)
Golden Orb
Datz:
That orb's the key to the secret hideout.

Hmm... This is that whatchamacallit, ain't it.
Phoenix:
What is?
Datz:
You know, that whatchamacallit. Um... What were we talking about again?
Phoenix:
It's all right. You don't have to force yourself if you've got nothing to say...
Datz:
...Well, PW, my friend, it's about time for me to get going. After all, I AM the fangs of the Defiant Dragons. Datz Are'bal!
Phoenix:
You're not going to do that "alley-oop" thing again, are you?
Datz:
I was just getting to that! See ya when I see ya! Alley-oop!

*whine*
Phoenix:
Shah'do... What happened to him, anyway?
Ahlbi:
He came out of the manhole about five minutes after you went in. Sorry he wasn't much help!
Shah'do:
*whine*
Rayfa:
...Well? Did you find anything of worth?
Phoenix:
Oh, uh... I tripped and fell down there. I must've been out cold for a while. (I better keep things to myself for now.)
Rayfa:
I figured as much.
Phoenix:
(I have to find that secret hideout Mr. Are'bal was talking about. I should probably start with places that have something to do with the high priest.)
Examine
Manhole
Rayfa:
What is it, Barbed Head? Is the sewer calling to you once more?
Phoenix:
Not exactly... (I probably shouldn't tell her about Mr. Are'bal...)
Talk
Any ideas?
Rayfa:
Barbed Head... I detect a foul odor emanating from you.
Phoenix:
Well, I did walk through the sewers, so...
Rayfa:
Stay back! Keep your stink to yourself!
Phoenix:
I'd be glad to leave you alone if you'd like.
Rayfa:
Who said you could walk away from me, you muttonhead!
Phoenix:
Fine, I'll stick to you like glue.
Rayfa:
No, that is too close!
Phoenix:
(I just can't win with her.)
What to do
Rayfa:
Even after investigating the sewers, you have nothing.
Phoenix:
Well, I'm not ready to give up yet! (Besides, I wouldn't say I have nothing.) There's nowhere I wouldn't go if it would help Maya!
Rayfa:
So, what will it be next? Will you dive into a septic tank?
Phoenix:
Uuh... I-If it would help Maya, I wouldn't rule it out!
Rayfa:
S-Stay back!
Phoenix:
I thought it was just a hypothetical!
Present
Golden Orb
Rayfa:
That orb has a mesmerizing core. I must take a closer look at it.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Are'bal entrusted me with this, so maybe I shouldn't let even Princess Rayfa handle it.) Y-Your Benevolence? Wouldn't you be defiled by touching an object that has been in the hands of a lawyer?
Rayfa:
I suppose so.
Phoenix:
...You do know that there are no such things as lawyer cooties, right?
May 11Inner Sanctum
Rayfa:
Barbed Head. You already searched here, did you not?
Phoenix:
Oh, umm... I just thought I'd look around again. You know, in case I missed something? (I probably shouldn't tell her I'm looking for the secret rebel hideout.) We have a saying back home: "Leave no stone unturned."
Rayfa:
Hmm? ...Oh, yes. You cannot stump me. I know that one.
Phoenix:
(Actually, "I don't have a clue" is written all over your face...)
Examine
Prayer flags
Phoenix:
I can't believe Mr. Are'bal used this as a parachute.
Rayfa:
That reckless fool... Then again, he must have a screw loose if he counts himself among those vile rebels.
Phoenix:
(I wouldn't exactly call him crazy... but he's certainly one-of-a-kind.)
Statue (zoom in right)
Phoenix:
It's a statue of a bird... I should take a closer look later.
Statue's missing eye
Phoenix:
Hey, this eye is missing.
Rayfa:
What are you doing? You must not touch that for no reason!
Phoenix:
S-Sorry! But that shape... Hmm, I wonder...
Present Golden Orb
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"I knew it!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This might fit in that cavity.
Rayfa:
Pohlkunka! Wh-What are you doing?! You... chowderhead! Remove your hand from there this instant!
Phoenix:
S-Sorry! I just thought this might fit in there.
Rayfa:
Are you blind?! They have entirely different shapes!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, that was a long shot. Still, I can't help feeling I have something that would fit in there.)
Rayfa:
Do not let me catch you needlessly touching the statue again!
Phoenix:
A-Alright already, I get it...
Leads back to:
"But that shape..."
Phoenix:
I knew it!
Rayfa:
Wh-Wh-Wha...?! ........................
Phoenix:
(She must be at a loss for words. And that doesn't happen too often.)
Rayfa:
...What is this place?! E-Explain yourself at once, Barbed Head!
Phoenix:
(I don't think she's ready for the full story...) I don't really know much myself, but... It seems to be a secret rebel hideout. (If I'm shocked there's a secret door here, I imagine that goes double for Rayfa.)
Rayfa:
A rebel hideout in the Inner Sanctum?! Somebody will pay for this!
Phoenix:
W-Well for now, I think I'll have a look around.
Rayfa:
Wait! You must not enter before the police!
Phoenix:
Don't worry, I won't disturb anything. (Or at least I'll try not to...) Besides, with you watching over me, it should be fine, right? And, uh, you see...
Rayfa:
...Fine. Just please stop pleading your case. I can only stand so much lawyerly drivel. But I will be presenting all information gleaned from your efforts here to the police.
Phoenix:
Of course. Now, shall we?
Rayfa:
I will go no further.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. You're not supposed to come in contact with the taint of Lady Kee'ra's battles.
Rayfa:
Very good, Barbed Head. I commend you for remembering!
Phoenix:
O-Oh, well thank you! (Wait, why am I thanking her?)
Rayfa:
I may not be able to enter, but I will allow no misdeeds on your part. I will be watching you like a warbaa'd from the entrance here!
Phoenix:
I told you I'm not going to do anything! (I better hurry before she changes her mind!)
Examine
Rotated statue
Phoenix:
(Who'd have guessed a rebel hideout would be at the back of the Inner Sanctum? Then again, the sanctum's not open to the public. What better place to hide away from prying eyes?)
May 11Secret Hideout
Rayfa:
I believe this to be a sacred space that enshrines the source of the spring water.
Phoenix:
(That makes sense. The rebels must've converted it into a secret hideout. But what about that warbaa'd revolving door? I wonder if that, too, was originally intended to hide and protect this sacred space.)
Rayfa:
To think those filthy rebels were scheming their schemes in this most sacred space...! It is a desecration upon Khura'inism itself! The Defiant Dragons shall pay for this!
Phoenix:
(I suppose it's only natural that she'd be upset. But the investigation must go on!) I think I'll start by taking a picture of the place. (Good thing I brought a camera to snap some souvenir shots.)
Rayfa:
Stop that! You must not take photos here without permission!
Phoenix:
(Rayfa's really fired up. She's sticking her head in as far as it will go. I guess she won't be "tainted" as long as she doesn't touch anything...?)
Rebel Hideout Photo added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Now, to search every nook and cranny...
Rayfa:
Barbed Head! Just because it is hard for me to see your every move... ...do not use that as an excuse to touch and break things!
Phoenix:
I heard you the first time! (Sheesh...)
Examine
Banner
Rayfa:
How dare those filthy insurgents raise their banner amid such a sacred space! Barbed Head! You must burn it at once!
Phoenix:
...Um, didn't you tell me not to touch or damage anything?
Rayfa:
Hmph, this is an exception! Very well, if you will not do it, then I will!
Phoenix:
But, Your Benevolence, I thought you're not supposed to come in here.
Rayfa:
Nngrrrrrrr...!
Phoenix:
(For once, the strange customs of this kingdom are working in my favor.) Hm? (There's something under the banner. A microphone? What's this doing here? Was someone trying to record something with it?)
Smaller mossy stone
Phoenix:
A large stone slab... (It's shaped like a magatama. It looks rather unstable. I bet it'd tip over in an earthquake.) Hm? What's that earthy, grass-like smell?
Rayfa:
It is the smell of the moss that covers the stone.
Phoenix:
Oh, so this shaggy green stuff is moss... ...Hm? It looks like some of the moss about halfway up has been disturbed. ...I wonder why that is? (One quick touch can't hurt, right…?) Whoa! (The slab's starting to wobble!)
Rayfa:
What is happening?! What have you done to the sacred space?!
Phoenix:
N-N-Nothing! (All I did was nudge it a little... I knew it looked unstable. Probably best not to touch it again.)
Water or larger mossy stone
Phoenix:
So, this is the water source that supplies the Inner Sanctum's spring. It flows through the channel built into the floor before heading outside.
Rayfa:
Lady Kee'ra uses this sacred water to wash the taint of battle from her body.
Phoenix:
It's also not red like the water in the spring.
Directions
Phoenix:
Looks like an order from Dhurke.
Rayfa:
What's this?! Let me see that!
Phoenix:
I thought you're not supposed to touch anything in here.
Rayfa:
This is an exception! Now hand it over! Let's see here... Hmm... ...O Holy Mother!
Phoenix:
What? What does it say?
Rayfa:
It is an order intended for that rebel named Datz. It reads... "After the rite, infiltrate the palace under the guise of returning Lady Kee'ra's costume... ...and search for clues about that incident from twenty-three years ago. --Dhurke"
Phoenix:
Twenty-three years ago? He must mean the assassination of Queen Amara. I wonder what the rebels are up to... (It's intriguing and all, but it doesn't seem related to the case at hand.)
Rayfa:
This will not do! I must warn my mother at once!
Phoenix:
No need to do that. This order will never be carried out. Lady Kee'ra's costume is still here, and Abbot Inmee is no longer able to aid the rebels.
Rayfa:
Hmph, I-I knew that!
Directions (subsequent times)
Rayfa:
Is there anything else you would like me to read, Barbed Head?
Phoenix:
Oh, um, let's see... Uhh... How about this note?
Rayfa:
Let me see that. Konuuro, zabaas, bahr'bahr, yak, and roux... Wait, this looks familiar!
Phoenix:
What is it? Some kind of Khura'inist spell?
Rayfa:
No, it's a recipe for Khura'inese curry.
Phoenix:
I guess the rebels enjoy a home-cooked meal, just like everyone else.
Plumed Punisher poster
Phoenix:
There's a Plumed Punisher calendar here.
Rayfa:
Ah, now I understand. The villains in The Plumed Punisher are based on the insurgents. Watching the show must have roused their ire against Lady Kee'ra!
Phoenix:
(Umm... I doubt that's it.)
Plumed Punisher clock
Phoenix:
Look!
Rayfa:
What is it, Barbed Head?
Phoenix:
It's a Plumed Punisher clock!
Rayfa:
Why, I believe it's... It is a limited-edition promotional item given to fifty lucky viewers! This rare item plays the Plumed Punisher theme song ever hour! H-Hand it over now, Barbed Head!
Phoenix:
Ah! (She snatched it away from me! No matter what she says, Rayfa is definitely a huge fan.)
Rayfa:
Hmm... What a fine item. And this switch... If I'm right...
Phoenix:
(It's the Plumed Punisher theme song…)
Rayfa:
Yes, now I see! The insurgents who use this room... ...must be Plumed Punisher fans!
Phoenix:
...That may be so, but I don't see how it's relevant to this case.
Chain
Phoenix:
The statue door rotates when you pull this chain.
Rayfa:
I see...Then you must shut the door and destroy its mechanism! That will deprive the insurgents of access to this place!
Phoenix:
B-But wouldn't that trap me in here?
Rayfa:
Not to worry! I would come to visit you once a year.
Phoenix:
(She's actually serious!)
Cart or guns
Phoenix:
Weapons! And lots of them, too.
Rayfa:
We are lucky we found them before they could be used. Excellent work, Barbed Head!
Phoenix:
Oh, uh, thanks... (If the rebellion ever happens, I hope it's bloodless.)
Blood
Phoenix:
What's this? A bloodstain...? I should probably try to figure out what happened in here. Hmm...
Rayfa:
Do not tamper with any evidence before the police arrive!
Phoenix:
...The police? Hey, that reminds me. Ema gave me something just for times like these.
Ema:
I thought it might help your investigation. Here, it's all yours! I wanted to bring you a bunch of other forensic tools... ...but they were confiscated at the airport.
Phoenix:
(Luminol testing fluid... This actually might come in handy.)
Phoenix:
(Luminol testing fluid glows in reaction to even the tiniest traces of blood. So it can even detect areas where blood has been wiped up. It might help us figure out what happened in here. Okay, time for science to do its thing! First, let me put these red-tinted glasses on to see the luminol's glow... ...then I just touch wherever I want to spray some of the luminol. Areas where there was blood will react by turning blue.)
Luminol
Spray area near door
Leads to:
Leads to:
"Th-This is a huge bloodstain!"
Phoenix:
Th-This is a huge bloodstain! Something big must've happened here!
Rayfa:
Perhaps the high priest's blood flowed in there from under the warbaa'd statue.
Phoenix:
...There was definitely a lot of blood here. But it's impossible to say much else at this point. I'll just take a picture for now. Oh, right. Luminol reactions don't show up in photos. I'll just have to take some notes. That should do it!  (...I didn't notice before, but the bloodstain looks like it was smeared away in one place. Is it because the warbaa'd revolving door passed over it?)
Rebel Hideout Photo updated in the Court Record.
Blood (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
That bloodstain on the floor... The luminol showed that it was even bigger than I expected. Something definitely happened here, and it wasn't good.
Rayfa:
How can you be so sure? Perhaps the high priest's blood flowed in there from under the warbaa'd statue.
Phoenix:
True... But there's not much else we can say at this point.
Phoenix:
...Well, I think that covers about everything here.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! You shouldn't have come in here before the police!
Phoenix:
Sorry, but I was in a hurry. I didn't do anything I wasn't supposed to. Her Benevolence can attest to that.
Rayfa:
It is your fault for being so slow. I expect the police to work faster and more efficiently!
Ema:
Sorry...
Rayfa:
Well, Barbed Head? Have you not already seen enough?
Phoenix:
I guess it's about time I got back to the temple and go over everything I've learned.
May 11Tehm'pul Temple
Ahlbi:
Welcome back, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Unfortunately, I didn't find anything conclusive.
Ahlbi:
N-No way!
Rayfa:
...I do not understand, Barbed Head.
Phoenix:
What don't you understand?
Rayfa:
Why you did not commit any misdeeds during your investigation. After all, lawyers ply their trade primarily through illicit means and methods.
Phoenix:
What?! Who told you that?
Rayfa:
My mother. Are you saying she was wrong? ...No, that cannot be! You must have committed some sort of misdeed right under my nose.
Phoenix:
(If that were so, she wasted her whole day following me around.)
Rayfa:
Hm? What is it? ........................ Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has need of me.
Phoenix:
What's going on?
Rayfa:
I must go perform a Divination Séance for Puhray Zeh'lot. It is our custom for the prosecution to review its contents before a trial begins.
Phoenix:
I see...
Rayfa:
.........The third time will be the charm. My insights will finally bring you to your knees tomorrow! And I will teach that neophyte practitioner a lesson!
Phoenix:
(Looks like the royal priestess is back with a vengeance. She's made a full recovery from when we started the investigation earlier today.) I look forward to seeing you in court, Your Benevolence!
Rayfa:
Hmph. Your overconfidence will be your downfall. You will not look so confident when I am finished with you tomorrow!
Phoenix:
Actually... I'm not really looking forward to seeing her tomorrow. Especially without any solid evidence.
Ahlbi:
Why don't we go over everything you know so far?
Phoenix:
All right. Hmm, let's see here... Acolyte Zeh'lot was killed during the rite with Lady Kee'ra's dagger. And Maya's fingerprints were found on it.
Ahlbi:
That doesn't sound very good!
Phoenix:
I know... It's the very definition of being up a creek without a paddle. The day before his murder, Zeh'lot enjoyed a meal with the high priest, his wife, and Maya. I also learned about spirit channeling here in Khura'in.
Ahlbi:
None of that sounds very helpful.
Phoenix:
Oh, but I did hear something interesting. That the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra might be working for the justice minister.
Ahlbi:
What?! Really?! Our kingdom is supposed to be ruled through faith and laws. We can't allow the people to be controlled by fear and violence!
Phoenix:
Ahlbi, that sounds like something a rebel might say.
Ahlbi:
I-It does? But if that Lady Kee'ra really is one of Minister Inga's subordinates... ...that would exonerate Miss Maya!
Phoenix:
Unfortunately, I have no way of proving it in court.
Ahlbi:
...Oh, that's too bad.
Phoenix:
Oh, I almost forgot about the secret rebel hideout we found at the Inner Sanctum. There was a bloodstain inside. But I don't know if or how it's connected to this case, though.
Ahlbi:
Wow! A secret room at the Inner Sanctum?! That would be a huge hit with tourists!
Phoenix:
(This kid really is an entrepreneur at heart.)
Ahlbi:
...Er, what I mean is that hideout could be important to your case.
Phoenix:
Maybe, but it's still too early to tell. Argh... Looks like I'm heading into court without any useful evidence.
Ahlbi:
We'll just have to pray something appears during tomorrow's trial...
Phoenix:
Princess Rayfa's Divination Séance might be my only hope. There could be some new information in it that might help.
Ahlbi:
Th-The Divination Séance?! But I thought it always works against the accused!
Phoenix:
...Not always.
Datz:
Right! It's like Dhurke used to say: The royal priestess's Insights are just another piece of evidence.
Ahlbi:
Really?! I never heard anyone say that before. It's hard to figure you out sometimes, sir.
Phoenix:
(Divination Séances worked both ways before the Defense Culpability Act. It's only now that the people of Khura'in find it strange.)
Ahlbi:
Um, Mr. Wright? I just wanted to say... good luck tomorrow!
Phoenix:
Thanks. I can't afford to lose this next one. (I've collected all sorts of information, but I haven't even started connecting the dots. If I could do that, I might have a shot at pulling off a win. Rayfa's Insights will be the deciding factor. It's a huge gamble, but it's all I've got!) 
To Be Continued
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
Nothing particularly interesting here.
Area already examined
Phoenix:
I've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.
Exit Magatama session
Phoenix:
(I'm pretty sure I know what I need to, but... ...maybe I should go over it all again.)
