Examine evidence
Front side of Yatagarasu's Badge
Edgeworth:
This is the badge that Kay is always wearing. It's emblazoned with the mark of the Yatagarasu and it really stands out. I doubt there are any thieves who would actually wear it.
Lotta:
So, what are y'all gonna do now? I reckon... yer through bein' a prosecutor, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes... that's true, I suppose. (I'm no longer a prosecutor. However...)
Kay:
You can't stop thinking about what Mr. de Killer said, right?
Edgeworth:
Indeed...
de Killer:
I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved?
Edgeworth:
(This case isn't over yet... The person in the red hood who kidnapped Kay at Gourd Lake... And this letter from an unknown sender. Someone's schemes are at work behind this case...)
Lotta:
Must be tough havin' a case you just solved still naggin' at the back of yer mind. Well, I got some investigatin' of my own to be doin', so I'll be off!
Kay:
That's amazing! You've already decided on your next scoop?
Lotta:
What're ya sayin' there, missy!? Don't you be underestimatin' the likes of Lotta Hart! I've covered a lotta scoops, ya know? I always have an extra scoop or two up my sleeves...
???:
S-Someone! Help!
Kay:
Yikes! What's that!?
???:
S-Someone! P-Please help!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. This woman is...) What's happened!?
???:
S-Somebody's dead! A m-monster...!
Edgeworth:
(A... monster?)
Lotta:
I-It's a scoop! A scoop's callin' me!
???:
Please follow me! It's this way!
Kay:
Has something else happened? Again!?
Edgeworth:
I don't know... At any rate, we should follow her for now.
April 6, 10:05 AMOutside Grand TowerTemporary Film Lot
Kay:
Eh!? These are...!?
Lotta:
G-Genuine hoofprints!
Edgeworth:
(Hoofprints? Impossible! No animal could be this large...)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Look!
Edgeworth:
(Agent Lang...! Why is he here?)
Kay:
Ah! Someone's on the ground!
Edgeworth:
(It can't be... The president of Zheng Fa... Di-Jun Huang!)
Lang:
........
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang!
Lang:
......Mr. Prosecutor. Didn't take you long to get here.
Edgeworth:
What happened?
Lang:
What... happened? Ha! That's what I'd like to know!
Edgeworth:
(It would seem that he's in a considerable amount of shock over the president's death. However... ...what exactly are these giant footprints...? And what could have happened to the president?)
Lotta:
It's a m... m... monster!
Edgeworth:
A... monster?
Lotta:
Yessiree! Lookie here! Ain't no doubt about it, these are clearly the footprints of a monster! On this day, mankind received a grim reminder: we live in fear of the Mighty Moozilla!
Edgeworth:
(Mighty... Moozilla...?)
Lotta:
This here's a scoop! I got myself a scoop! "Man Trampled to Death by Monster!" I reckon it'll be the top story in tomorrow's paper!
Edgeworth:
(What nonsense... There are no such things as monsters... Wait, it can't be...?)
Huang:
I am Di-Jun Huang. I have heard of your deeds. You saved my country from a great crisis.
Edgeworth:
The real assassin was you all along...!
de Killer:
That is correct. I received a request from a key individual... ...to take the president's life...
Edgeworth:
(That man... could he have...?)
Lang:
Hey, you! Were you the first to discover the body?
???:
Y-Yes, I...! Umm, well.
Edgeworth:
(! Agent Lang?)
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "First come, first suspected." You! Did you really just discover the body!?
???:
O-O-O-O-O-Of course!
Kay:
Please calm down! You're scaring her!
Edgeworth:
(He does seem to have lost his composure...)
Lang:
Tch. Calm down!? How am I supposed to calm down? Do you know who's been murdered!? Di-Jun Huang... the president of Zheng Fa!
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
...Agent Lang. This isn't like you.
Lang:
!
Edgeworth:
When we first met, you had an army of subordinates under your command... ...and you boasted of having the highest arrest rate in Interpol. And what now? Did you forget the fundamentals of investigation along with all of your men?
Lang:
What... did you say...?
Edgeworth:
Instead of questioning people at random, you should investigate the crime scene first. Am I wrong?
Lang:
........Tch! I don't need you to tell me that. ...I'll do a thorough investigation.
Edgeworth:
(Well. At least it seems he's calmed for now...)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Let's investigate too!
Edgeworth:
Yes. Let us investigate. (Right now, I do not have any investigation rights, but until the police arrive...)
Lotta:
What're y'all sayin'? Ain't it obvious who dunnit!? The man behind it all is the Mighty Moozilla! Hm? Well, I guess it ain't the "man" behind it, more like the "monster" behind it, ya know?
Edgeworth:
Good grief... Could you please just try not to interfere with the investigation?
Lotta:
Shut yer trap! Yer the one who better not be stickin' yer nose in my business! I ain't forgivin' ya if ya mess up my scoop!
???:
Umm... Excuse me.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. It's the woman who first discovered the body. I feel like I've seen her before...)
???:
You're... Mr. Edgeworth, right? Do you remember me?
Edgeworth:
Umm. Y-Yes. That case... from before...
Kay:
Huh? Do you know her?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I do. (At least I think I do...)
Kay:
My name's Kay Faraday! I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!
Penny:
My. You have such a cute assistant? I'm Penny Nichols. I'm an assistant at Global Studios. I'm in charge of the props and sets. It's nice to meet you.
Edgeworth:
(Yes, that was it... I once handled a case that occurred during the filming of the Steel Samurai. This woman was a member of the show's staff, and she was involved in the incident. I must have met with her on numerous occasions over the course of the case... ...but to be honest, I had completely forgotten about her...) It's nice to see you again. The fact that you are here must mean that this place is...
Penny:
Yes! This is sort of an outdoor film lot for Global Studios. They're shooting a movie here right now. I was the first to arrive today, to set everything up for the filming... ...but everything seemed strange... Those giant footprints... and that... d-dead body...
Edgeworth:
I see. We shall examine the body. At any rate, could you please contact the police?
Penny:
Y-Yes! Right away!
Edgeworth:
(I'll have to take the time to listen to her story later... First, let's examine the scene. There are many things besides the body that concern me. I'll need to examine every nook and cranny of this place...)
Begin Investigation
Outside Grand TowerTemporary Film Lot
Logic
"Rear entrance forced open" and "Combination lock"
Edgeworth:
The front entrance, which leads to the Tower Plaza, was locked with a combination lock. At the other hand... the lock on the rear entrance, which leads to the Grand Tower, was broken. Now, where does this lead us?
Kay:
Heh heh heh! I know this one! The culprit entered from the rear entrance, right!?
Edgeworth:
Exactly. And knowing this... we now understand one more critical fact. The culprit must be someone who didn't know the number to unlock the combination lock.
Kay:
Right! If they knew the code, it would've been way easier to enter from the front entrance! Entering through the back door is common sense for a thief. It's much less conspicuous. We can't underestimate a culprit who thinks like a thief! Please keep your guard up!
Edgeworth:
(She sure becomes lively all of a sudden when this subject gets brought up...) To put it simply, everyone involved with the movie knows the combination for the lock. In other words, it's quite likely that the culprit is someone who is not involved with the film.
Combination Lock data jotted down in my Organizer.
"Dented fence" and "Broken horn"
Edgeworth:
The dent in this fence... and the broken horn... Neither of these things were there yesterday evening. Based on the fact that these two things have changed...
Kay:
Ah! Could Moozilla's head have...!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. The head that was on the rooftop (Monster's head - It may have rolled off the studio roof and tumbled to the ground.) may have tumbled down onto the ground. This is a new possibility. (Which would mean that...)
"Stepped on by a monster?" and "Monster's head"
Edgeworth:
We may have found the missing murder weapon...
Kay:
Eh! Really!?
Edgeworth:
At the moment, I can only say that it is just a possibility... If the giant monster head had fallen off from the studio roof...
Kay:
Ah! That could definitely be a murder weapon! Ms. Nichols, may we investigate the studio roof?
Penny:
The roof? OK, I understand! Go on ahead! But the stairs can be a little bit slippery, so please watch your step!
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Notice anything?
Kay:
I still can't believe the president has been murdered... Do you think he was really trampled to death by a monster?
Edgeworth:
Surely you can't be serious? There are no such things as monsters.
Kay:
Whaaat!? So it wasn't a monster who did this? Then, who do you say killed the president!?
Edgeworth:
As the president of Zheng Fa, I'm sure there are more than a few people targeting his life. Just like Shelly de Killer tried to do, not too long ago.
Kay:
So, you think he was killed by someone like Mr. de Killer?
Edgeworth:
I can't say for certain yet... but neither can I deny that possibility.
Kay:
But, we can't deny the possibility of him being killed by a monster, either! I mean, just take a look at all these monster's footprints! Plus, a horn-like object was lying on the ground next to the president.
Edgeworth:
(A horn-like object...? I can't say for certain that it's not related to this case. Perhaps I should take a moment and compare it with the evidence I have on hand.)
Agent Lang
Kay:
I never would have thought we'd run into Mr. Lang in a place like this! But, he didn't seem to be in a very good mood though.
Edgeworth:
It's understandable. Agent Lang is from the Republic of Zheng Fa. With President's Huang's death, he must have a lot on his mind.
Kay:
Come to think of it, he doesn't have his men-in-black in tow with him today either. I always picture him with an army of subordinates following him around...
Edgeworth:
(Agent Lang... I wonder if something has happened to him?)
Moozilla (after examining broken lock and talking about "Broken horn" with Penny)
Edgeworth:
Did you already know about this "Moozilla" monster?
Kay:
Nope. I just learned about it today! I mean, the movie came out 12 years ago, right? Back then, I was just a cute little girl! But, the "Mighty Moozilla" sure does sound pretty sweet!
Edgeworth:
Heh... It certainly does seem like the kind of movie you would enjoy.
Kay:
Well, duh, it's a giant monster! What's not to like about giant monsters!?
Edgeworth:
I for one can't understand the appeal of these so-called "giant monsters".
Kay:
Well, I don't get what's so great about the Steel Samurai!
Edgeworth:
Ugh...! Kay! I'll have you know, the Steel Samurai is...
Kay:
Yeah, yeah. More importantly, shouldn't we get back to our investigation now? Why don't we take a minute to reorganize any information we haven't yet put together? We might be able to make a new connection!
Edgeworth:
Yes... Indeed.
Present
Yatagarasu's Badge
Kay:
Eureka! Seeing this badge... just gave me a great idea! As a token of appreciation for everything you've done for me, Mr. Edgeworth... ...I'm gonna carve an awesome badge for you out of an eraser. Should I carve your face from the side? Or from the front? Hmm, maybe a diagonal view...
Edgeworth:
(Why are you so set on the theme being my face...?)
Kay:
Ah! But if it's something new you want, how about a view from directly below?
Edgeworth:
(This badge has quickly gone from "awesome" to "awful"...)
Letter from Unknown or Grand Tower
Kay:
When my memory was gone, I... ...I felt like I was walking through a freezing rain the entire time. But, when it all came back...
Edgeworth:
...Did something happen when you regained your memory?
Kay:
Nope... It's nothing. Thank you so very much!
Edgeworth:
...Kay. I am not the one who recovered your memories. The person you should thank is the one who had you write in that notebook.
Kay:
Daddy! Mr. Edgeworth! Thank you both so much! ...Eheheh. I feel a lot better now!
Edgeworth:
If you're going to shout, please give a little more consideration to the time and place...
Crime Scene Notes
Kay:
Mr. President... We only just exposed the fake assassination, I can't believe he was really assassinated...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It's quite tragic, but no matter how you look at it, this time he's truly gone. Our final parting gift to him will be uncovering the truth behind this case.
Kay:
That's right. This'll be... a paycheck for the president!
Edgeworth:
I think you mean "payback", Kay.
Monster Movie Flyer, Moozilla's Head, or Moozilla Doll
Kay:
The Mighty Moozilla vs Gourdy! What an earth-shattering battle that would be! Gourdy tries to devour Moozilla! But, the horns get caught, so it can't swallow Moozilla whole! Moozilla tries biting back! But, Gourdy's skin is really slick, so Moozilla can't chomp down. Oh, this kind of buildup always gets my heart pounding!
Edgeworth:
(I'll never understand why today's youth get so invested in these things...)
Anything else
Kay:
I believe that even a Great Thief has rights. For example, we have the right to choose what we want to steal.
Edgeworth:
(I guess she doesn't consider this valuable.)
Monster costume
Edgeworth:
There is a monster costume in front of this building.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Is that really a costume? Maybe it's actually the monster who made all these footprints, and it just shrunk itself down!
Edgeworth:
......I'll say this one more time, so listen carefully. There is a monster costume in front of this building. It's just a costume!
Lighting equipment
Edgeworth:
This seems to be the lighting equipment they're using for the film.
Kay:
...Ah, that's right! There's something I wanted to ask you, Mr. Edgeworth! When I'm stealing something, can you use this to make me look cool in a spotlight?
Edgeworth:
You want someone to shine a light on you when you're stealing something?
Kay:
Well, duh! If the Yatagarasu's handiwork can't be seen because it's too dark... ...wouldn't you feel bad for the people watching?
Edgeworth:
(You're planning to steal things with an audience looking on...?)
Penny Nichols
Penny:
I'm sorry about earlier... I was... a little flustered.
Discovery of the body
Edgeworth:
Were you here alone?
Penny:
Yes. I arrived before everyone else today in order to get things prepared. When I entered the lot, I immediately noticed... those giant hoofprints.
Kay:
The monster's footprints, right!? Weren't you surprised?
Penny:
Yes. Because they hadn't been there yesterday evening.
Edgeworth:
(So that means the footprints were made last night...)
Penny:
Well, when I first saw them, I thought they were a part of the set. But, when I got closer to the studio, I saw that a person had collapsed.
Edgeworth:
You didn't notice until you got closer...?
Penny:
Lately, it seems my eyesight has gotten worse again, and my glasses aren't strong enough. As I approached the body, I finally realized what it was. I was so scared, I ran away.
Edgeworth:
(And that was when she ran into us...)
Filming a movie
Edgeworth:
You said they were... filming a movie? Could it be... the Steel Samurai...?
Penny:
No.
Edgeworth:
(So it wasn't...)
Penny:
We're making a monster movie this time around. Have you ever hears of the "Mighty Moozilla" series?
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but no...
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth isn't interested in anything other than the Steel Samurai after all!
Edgeworth:
Th-That's not...
Penny:
I guess that's to be expected, as the promotion for the film hasn't really started yet. "The Mighty Moozilla! Its revival breaks its 12 years of silence!" It's the long awaited sequel to the original series, so the staff are all fired up! The film is set at the Grand Tower, so we're filming on location around this area.
Edgeworth:
(Come to think of it, yesterday...)
Gumshoe:
What's wrong, pal!? Did something happen at the Grand Tower!?
Cuuuuuut! Cut, cut, cut, cuuuut!
???:
E-Excuse me! We're sort of in the middle of shooting a movie, and umm...
Edgeworth:
(I saw them filming something then. It must have been this...)
Kay:
I bet it ends with Moozilla completely destroying the Grand Tower!
Penny:
Tee-hee. I wonder? You'll have to look forward to finding out in the theaters. If you like, you can have this.
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Let's see...
The Battle of the Century! Now... it meets its greatest rival! "Mighty Moozilla vs Gourdy"
Edgeworth:
(Wait... Gourdy?)
Penny:
This time, it won't just be Moozilla, a rival monster appears as well! Have you heard of it? Gourdy of Gourd Lake.
Kay:
Ah! Wasn't it the talk of the town two or three years ago? It's a mysterious monster living in Gourd Lake! By chance, someone took a photo of it!
Edgeworth:
(It wasn't just the talk of the town, it was also involved in a case from my past. Gourdy... huh. Now there's a name I don't really want to remember.)
Penny:
When the director caught wind of that rumor, he decided to add it into the story.
Edgeworth:
(I get the feeling he was a bit late to catch on...)
Penny:
Please look forward to seeing the showdown between these two rival monsters!
Monster Movie Flyer data jotted down in my Organizer.
After examining horn
Edgeworth:
(Is there anything out of place with what I've investigated so far?)
The entrance
Edgeworth:
(I should confirm what the security situation was like at the scene of the crime.) Ms. Nichols. Was the entrance to this place locked?
Penny:
Yes. It's locked with this.
Kay:
It's one of those types where you have to put in the correct numbers to open it, right?
Edgeworth:
About this combination lock, was it also properly locked today?
Penny:
Yes. When I arrived here today, it was locked tight.
Edgeworth:
Who knows the combination?
Penny:
The producer, the director, the staff, and the actors... I think everyone involved in the movie knew about it.
Edgeworth:
(So anyone involved with the film could have opened the combination lock (Combination lock - Used on front entrance. Only the cast and crew knew the combination.) and gone in.)
Broken horn
Edgeworth:
About this horn... Have you ever seen it before?
Penny:
Huh? That's Moozilla's horn. It's a model we made to use in our ad campaign. ...Where was it?
Edgeworth:
It was on the ground by the back entrance.
Penny:
That's strange... Moozilla's head should have been stored on the studio roof.
Edgeworth:
I suppose the head would have to be rather large, wouldn't it?
Penny:
Yes! It's not as big as the real thing, of course, but it's still quite large! Look. You can see it from here. See? It's right there.
Edgeworth:
It certainly is large... (Broken horn - Was lying next to the body. Had been stored on the roof last night.)
Present
Monster's Footprints
Penny:
...If I remember correctly, the Moozilla in our film also has split hooves.
Edgeworth:
Surely, you're not suggesting that the president was trampled to death by a monster?
Penny:
Oh, no! Rather, speaking as a member of the studio staff... ...I don't believe Moozilla would commit a murder. Giant monsters only bother the people in the movies. That's the cardinal rule for those involved in monster movies.
Edgeworth:
(Indeed. It would be problematic if it weren't that way.)
Monster Movie Flyer or Moozilla's Head
Penny:
Moozilla is a symbol of nature. That's why it destroys cities.
Edgeworth:
(That's a rather sketchy explanation...)
Penny:
It uses its horns to attack, but that's not its only technique. It has a Sonic Moo sound wave attack, a sticky drool spray, dual milk shooters... ...a BBQ smokescreen diversion, and a leather shows &amp; bags production line ultra combo.
Kay:
The more you describe it... the less powerful it sounds.
Penny:
Well, making it look powerful is a job for us filmmakers, after all!
Edgeworth:
(...Won't the producers of the movie get mad at them?)
Anything else
Penny:
Ahh! Th-That's!
Edgeworth:
Hmm? Do you know something about this?
Penny:
Huh...? I-I'm sorry! I think I was just mistaken. Lately, the prescription of my glasses hasn't been quite right. I deeply apologize for my shameful behavior!
Edgeworth:
(That's not something you need to apologize for...)
(Clearing "Discovery of the body", "Filming a movie", "The entrance" and "Broken horn" "Talk" option before examining film crane and vinyl sheets leads to:)
Kay:
There sure are a lot of interesting things around here!
Penny:
Tee-hee. It's the equipment we use for filming. The Moozilla costume and the camera crane.
Kay:
They really are treasures! I'm getting kinda excited!
Edgeworth:
(It's possible that some of this equipment was used in the crime... I'd better take a closer look.)
Shi-Long Lang
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. So we meet again.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Just a few days ago, we met at the detention center...
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. What brings you here?
Lang:
Just some boring work. Nothing you need to know about.
Lang:
Tch. You always pick the worst time to show up. Anyone ever tell you that bad things happen when you're around? Just don't get in the way of my investigation, OK? I must avenge the death of our president...
Why were you here?
Edgeworth:
You arrived here before us... What were you doing in a place like this?
Lang:
.....You suspect me?
Edgeworth:
Heh... Come now.
Lang:
I heard a scream. It was the woman who found the body... After hearing the scream, I came in through that entrance over there. Apparently, it wasn't locked.
Edgeworth:
(Then why is there a lock on the ground over there...? I should take a closer look.)
Lang:
When I got in... ...woman who found the body was already running out the other exit over there.
Edgeworth:
(So he came here around the same time we did...) Why were you at the Grand Tower?
Lang:
Well... I had my reasons...
Edgeworth:
(...He also said something along those lines when we met at the detention center.)
Kay:
Maybe he's really a fan of giant monsters, and he came to sneak a peek at the Moozilla set?
Lang:
...Giant monsters? I've no interest in such things.
Edgeworth:
(He clearly doesn't think the murderer is a monster either.)
President Huang
Edgeworth:
It's regrettable what happened to the president...
Lang:
...Yeah. Huang was the pride of Zheng Fa. And yet...
Edgeworth:
It seems like you were quite close to the president.
Lang:
The previous head of the Lang clan, my father, served under President Huang. Protecting the life of the president has long been our clan's greatest duty. My old man received a great number of special medals from the president himself... As a token of his trust, the president left his will in the protection of the Lang clan. Those medals and that will, they were the pride of our clan. Our family treasures, so to speak. Tch. Who would've thought the day to unseal that will... would arrive so soon!
Kay:
So then. I guess the president was like a close family friend... ...Huh? But during the incident at Gourd Lake... ...why weren't you with the president, Mr. Lang?
Lang:
......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa.
Edgeworth:
(12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?)
Lang:
Even so, I still respect the man. Zheng Fa is a small country. But he carried the nation with his strength. Damn it! Just what were his bodyguards doing!?
Edgeworth:
Have you already contacted the embassy?
Lang:
Yeah, of course. I've also informed Zheng Fa and my clan as well. It's gotten pretty hectic there, what with the will and all... ...but it'll be the same here. Once the bodyguards show up. If you don't wanna see me rip into them, I suggest you get out of here soon.
Present
Yatagarasu's Badge
Lang:
That's what the little crow-girl's always wearing on her clothes, isn't it?
Kay:
It represents the most powerful animal in nature, my Yatagarasu Badge. Isn't it awesome!?
Lang:
Most powerful animal in nature...? Not so fast. I can't let that one slide. Lang Zi says: "The wolf is mightier than the crow." Just one slash from a wolf's claw and your little crow would be nevermore.
Kay:
Take that back, Wolfy! Thief Girl says: "The crow soars above all others." I'll swoop in to peck the wolf to pieces and then fly back up to avoid the wolf's claws!
Lang:
Don't underestimate a wolf's jumping ability! It'll bite the crow before it can fly away!
Kay:
A crow can flap its wings so hard, it'll blow the big bad wolf away!
Lang:
Grrrrr...
Kay:
Kaw kaw-kaw-kaw...
Edgeworth:
(They're squabbling like children.)
Monster's Footprints or Monster Movie Flyer
Lang:
Tch. Moozilla? What're you asking me about that for?
Edgeworth:
I won't say the culprit is a monster, but it seems a little too early to say it's unrelated. If you know anything, then by all means, please tell me.
Lang:
Hmph. The president always had a Moozilla doll with him. I've caught a glimpse of it on occasion. That's how I knew.
Edgeworth:
(A Moozilla doll, huh... Indeed, there was one inside the president's plane.)
Kay:
So even a foreign president was a fan. Moozilla sure has international appeal. You know how different countries have different sounds for animal noises? So, I wonder what kind of sounds a foreign Moozilla would make?
Edgeworth:
(I don't even know what kind of sound a domestic Moozilla would make...)
Crime Scene Notes
Lang:
Damn it! You don't have to show me that! Whoever killed the president... ...you can be damned well sure I'm gonan catch 'em!
Edgeworth:
(Agent Lang... Whenever President Huang is brought up, he seems to lose his composure.)
Kay:
I kinda feel bad for Mr. Lang... Isn't there anything we can do for him?
Edgeworth:
Yes. And it is for that reason we must listen carefully to what he has to say.
Anything else
Lang:
You keep shoving irrelevant nonsense under my nose... ...and I'll chew it to pieces!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... I think I should put this away for now.)
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Lang:
...Mr. Prosecutor. Right now, I'm just a single Interpol agent. A literal lone wolf. They probably won't let me be in charge of the investigation. But you better believe... my fangs are as sharp as ever...! I'd definitely capture the culprit with my own hands. And you'd better not get in my way.
Body
Kay:
Wow... It really is the president.
Edgeworth:
Yes. (To think we saw him alive just a few days ago...)
Kay:
That would make this a presidential assassination, right?
Edgeworth:
This is a bit flashy for an assassination...
Before deducing and examining ground and body
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After deducing and examining ground and body
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Ground around the body
Kay:
There are broken pieces of concrete scattered all around the president.
Edgeworth:
Yes. They were probably scattered about when the ground got damaged.
Kay:
And that must have been when the monster's foot went "Thud!"
Edgeworth:
If the culprit... was actually a monster.
Monster's Footprints data jotted down in my Organizer.
Kay:
Hmm... It kinda looks like a hoof, the way it's split in two like that! Yup, it definitely looks like a monster's footprint to me! And there's even three of them (Three footprints - There are three footprints at the scene. They are shaped like hooves.), Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
There are no such things as monsters. Do you honestly believe they exist?
Kay:
No, not really... but wouldn't it be cool if they did exist!?
Edgeworth:
...We're searching for the truth, Kay. Not for what is cool.
Body
Edgeworth:
There are no visible external wounds... but it's clear that he's already passed away.
Kay:
So then, I guess he really did get stepped on by a... a...
Edgeworth:
A monster (Stepped on by a monster? - The president was found dead in the middle of what looks like a footprint.)...? Hmph. That's impossible.
Kay:
Huh? Don't the president's clothes look a bit dirty to you?
Edgeworth:
Indeed, there appears to be some sort of yellow stain...
Kay:
I bet it's monster drool!
Edgeworth:
Kay, please be more serious. We'll need to have forensics take a closer look at this stain. (So, this was the state of the body... I should make a note of it.)
Crime Scene Notes jotted down in my Organizer.
Horn
Kay:
What's this white thing...? W-Wait! Is this a bone!? Looks like we've got a new case on our hands!
Edgeworth:
It looks less like a bone... and more like some kind of horn.
Deduce (after talking about "Filming a movie")
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce horn and present Monster Movie Flyer
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"Doesn't this horn belong to that monster, Moozilla?"
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
There's a connection between this spot and the evidence... I think!
Kay:
Huh! What's the connection!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... That's what I'm going to figure out right now.
Kay:
What!? You haven't figured it out yet!?
Edgeworth:
Nngh! (I guess that was wrong. Wasn't there something that fell near the victim that was bothering me? I should look into that before going any further.)
Edgeworth:
Doesn't this horn belong to that monster, Moozilla?
Kay:
You're right! It looks just like it! Maybe it's a prop for the film?
Edgeworth:
Based on the size of the horn... the head should be quite large.
Kay:
I wonder how it ended up here.
Edgeworth:
I'm sure we'll find out if we ask someone on the staff.
Lotta Hart
Lotta:
Whaddaya want!? I'm a busy gal! Ya best not get in my way!
Edgeworth:
Why are you so obsessed with that monster? Such a thing couldn't possibly exist...
Lotta:
What'd ya say...!? I ain't lettin' that pass! Moozilla lives! I'm sure of it! It's the mightiest monster on this side of the Pacific Rim.
Edgeworth:
I don't suppose you have some kind of basis for that?
Lotta:
I..... saw it with my own two eyes.
Kay:
What!? You saw it...? No way...
Lotta:
Yes way! The Mighty Moozilla was really here! Last night, when I was on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower.
Edgeworth:
You mean when you were snooping around the black market auction...
Lotta:
That's right! It was right around when I took this here photo!
Kay:
That's the photo of the person in the red hood! This was Jill Crane, right?
Lotta:
Ya see those blinds next to the red hood... Well, the Mighty Moozilla was on the other side!
Kay:
.......Err. But there's nothing in the photo...
Lotta:
It's mighty hard to capture somethin' like that from such a distance! But I seen it plain as day! Moozilla's giant eye eas peerin' in through those blinds!
Edgeworth:
(The monster was peering in?)
Lotta:
Lookie here! Now ain't the time for this! I gotta gather my materials! Ya'll are in my way! Now go on, git! Shoo! Shoo!
Edgeworth:
(How absurd...)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, you must be completely dumbfounded right now, aren't you?
Edgeworth:
(Hmph. Was it that clearly written on my face?)
Film crane
Kay:
...I wonder what this iron pole is for? Oh, maybe it's used to practice tree climbing?
Edgeworth:
No, this is a film crane. It's used to capture footage from high locations. Right now it's not attached, but normally there would be a camera connected to the end.
Kay:
I get it! This would be perfect for scoping out the places you're trying to steal from...! Do you think they would let me borrow this?
Edgeworth:
And how exactly, may I ask, do you intend to bring it back home with you?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, you can take the base, and I'll take the top part...
Edgeworth:
(...Does she actually expect me to help her?)
Kay:
If we take it nice and slow... we might be able to make it to your house, Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
(...Not only do you want me to help you carry it, but you plan to leave it at my house!?)
Vinyl sheets
Kay:
Ah! It's one of those sheets you lay out on the floor when you're having a picnic!
Edgeworth:
It's definitely a vinyl sheet, however... (I don't think it's for picnics.)
Penny:
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth. I-If I may... That's actually a waterproof sheet. It's used with the camera crane over there. We'll cover the camera crane with it when it's raining.
Kay:
Then, this sheet... must be pretty big.
Penny:
Yes. It would be pointless if we didn't cover up the entire crane. The weather was overcast yesterday, so we've been using it quite a bit.
Broken lock
Edgeworth:
Ms. Nichols, where does this entrance lead to...?
Penny:
It's connected to the Grand Tower lot.
Edgeworth:
(Does this case also have something to do with that building? The building with a secret 51st floor, where the black market auctions were being held. It wouldn't be strange if it were still hiding a few more secrets...)
Grand Tower data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
(Hm? This lock and chain...?)
Kay:
Ah! Someone cut through the chain!
Penny:
What? I'm sure it was locked up properly yesterday though.
Edgeworth:
Then, it's possible the culprit forced his way in through here... (Rear entrance forced open - The chain on the rear entrance was cut. Did the culprit do it?)
Penny:
Ahh!
Edgeworth:
(Wh-What is it...?)
Penny:
It's completely dented in... How did this happen!?
Edgeworth:
...Hmm. There is indeed a huge dent in the fence over there. Something rather heavy must have struck it, in order to make a dent like that.
Penny:
It wasn't like that at all yesterday...
Edgeworth:
(It wasn't...? So this dent (Dented fence - Yesterday it was still fine. Did it get struck by something heavy?) was made last night...)
Broken lock (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
This leads to the Grand Tower.
Kay:
But from where I'm standing, all I can see are just your everyday run-of-the-mill buildings. I don't see anyone special around here either.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. At least from where we're standing, that is. ...Now then, we have no time to waste. We should get back to investigating the film lot.
(Connecting "Stepped on by a monster?" and "Monster's head" Logic leads to:)
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. I'm going to take my leave here for a bit. There's something I have to check...
Edgeworth:
(Agent Lang. I wonder if he's caught onto something?) Hm?
???:
........ ........
Lang:
........
???:
.....Move it.
Lang:
What'd you say? Guess you're just a brat with no manners.
???:
...And you're an annoying old man. Quit your yapping already.
Lang:
!
Penny:
I-I'm terribly sorry! Come on, John!
Lang:
Tch!
Penny:
Oh! What were you doing!?
???:
.......Who was that?
Penny:
Someone from the police! Why'd you suddenly pick a fight with him?
???:
Hmph.
Kay:
That sure was a tense standoff!
Edgeworth:
(He didn't budge an inch, even before Agent Lang...)
Penny:
Ah! Allow me to introduce you! This is John Marsh. He's the lead actor in our movie.
Edgeworth:
(The lead actor... is this child?)
Kay:
Hi! I'm Kay Faraday. Nice to meet you!
Edgeworth:
And this is Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth.
John:
.......Prosecutor?
Penny:
He's a pretty famous prosecutor, you know.
John:
But he's not wearing a prosecutor's badge.
Edgeworth:
Gah! (He's frightfully perceptive...)
Penny:
Ah! John, it's probably better if you didn't go over there...
John:
............
Edgeworth:
(That's certainly not a sight a child should see... However, he is someone involved with the case. I'll need to speak with him later.)
Upstairs
Edgeworth:
May we see the roof?
Penny:
Yes, of course! Go right ahead!
Edgeworth:
(So, this is... Moozilla?)
Kay:
Huh? Somehow this doesn't feel quite right... See, this looks way cooler. ...And he doesn't have a nose ring either.
Penny:
Ah, I see. You two aren't familiar with Moozilla. This is Moozilla's original design from 12 years ago!
Kay:
Whaaat!? Th-Then, what's this?
Penny:
That's our take on it for the new movie. We revamped the design to appeal to modern audiences!
Kay:
"Revamped"...? But it looks totally different! And, no matter how you look at this one...
Edgeworth:
...it's a cow...
Penny:
Well, of course. After all, Moozilla was originally a cow monster.
Kay:
A c-cow monster...?
Penny:
Having a cow, an animal that humans are very familiar with, turn into a monster... ...allows us to question mankind's relationship with nature! That's the theme of Moozilla.
Kay:
......Meh. I just don't get it.
Edgeworth:
Nor do I...
Before examining model and table
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining model and table
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Heater
Kay:
There's a heater here. Do you think the staff uses it to keep themselves warm?
Edgeworth:
It's possible. Although it may be spring, it can still get rather chilly at night.
Kay:
M-Mr. Edgeworth! People are gonna think you're an old geezer if you say stuff like that! Even in the best of times, you tend to see things like an old man... Can't you at least TRY to be more cheerful and lively when you talk?
Edgeworth:
(Do I really seem that unlively...?)
Paint thinner
Edgeworth:
There is a can of paint thinner here. It's probably used for making props.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, doesn't the area around here look kinda burnt?
Edgeworth:
It does. This spread-out blue sheet, newspaper, and the side of this can all look burnt.
Kay:
Hmm. I wonder if this Moozilla's head can also shoot out flames? Well, this old Moozilla design doesn't really look like it could breathe fire anyways.
Edgeworth:
(That's not our main concern... but I'm certainly curious.)
Model
Penny:
We made this replica of the original Moozilla's head for promotional purposes. We'll be using it to let people know that the film is a sequel to the original series.
Kay:
I guess it would be hard for people to tell that they're the same monster.
Edgeworth:
As we suspected, one of the horns appears to be broken...
Kay:
So, did this head really crush the president?
Edgeworth:
It's possible, however... there's something I don't quite understand.
Kay:
What's that?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Nichols. This head looks rather heavy... How do you transport it?
Penny:
Ah, it's made so that it can be taken apart. It's not that hard, if you know how to do it. But, if you don't know how, it'd be pretty much impossible, I think.
Edgeworth:
(Which means it would be difficult for anyone not involved in the film...) When taken apart, would it be possible for one person to carry it alone?
Penny:
Definitely. Given enough time, even I could do it!
Moozilla's Head data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
(However, this face is...)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. Umm... I feel like I've seen this cow somewhere before...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. I was just thinking the exact same thing. (It was on board the president's plane... ...and in the storeroom of the black market auction...) The president's stuffed toy...
Kay:
So, that was a doll of the original Moozilla...
Edgeworth:
(Could this really be just a coincidence?)
Moozilla Doll data jotted down in my Organizer.
Model (subsequent times)
Kay:
Since he had a Moozilla doll with him, maybe the president was a big fan. And, his love for Moozilla was so great that he tried picking up the head and got crushed.
Edgeworth:
I doubt a normal person would have the strength to lift this up. Since he wasn't involved with the movie, he wouldn't have known how to take it apart.
Kay:
Hmm. If Moozilla really existed, that would explain everything though... Can't you just connect the pieces in that direction for once...? With logic, I mean.
Edgeworth:
Please don't give me that look.
Table
Edgeworth:
Some sort of wooden stand has fallen over. The area around it seems to be burnt black.
Penny:
Huh? Moozilla's head should have been on that stand...
Kay:
But, the legs have broken off... It doesn't look like it can be used anymore.
Edgeworth:
Hmm. The broken legs seem to be badly burnt. I think it's safe to assume that a small fire occurred here.
Kay:
A small fire, huh? Is that what burnt and broke the legs of the stand?
Edgeworth:
When the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand...
Kay:
...it would've fallen off! So, the head fell down because of the fire!
Edgeworth:
Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness.
Penny:
Oooh... I'm sorry. I'll make sure this doesn't happen again...! But, I don't think anyone used the heater yesterday...
Edgeworth:
(I see. In that case... I wonder what caused the fire?)
Light stand
Kay:
I could probably carry a light stand of this size on my shoulder.
Edgeworth:
Kay. Don't tell me you're planning to steal this.
Kay:
Of course not! But if I carried this around with me... ...I could shine a spotlight on you whenever you shout >Objection!Edgeworth:
Never, please.
Penny Nichols
Present
Moozilla Doll
Penny:
Ah, that's a first-generation Moozilla plushie! ...So you knew about it?
Edgeworth:
No. I only happened to see the doll. I didn't know anything about the films.
Kay:
I think this is much cuter than the head on the roof. It's a little dirty though.
Penny:
That can't be helped. Those were sold quite a long time ago, after all. Back then, it was aimed at children, and it seems to have had moderate success. I heard a lot of them were sold as presents.
Kay:
If someone gave me one as a present, I'd want the new and improved version of Moozilla. If someone were to give me a present, that is!
Edgeworth:
(Why is she looking at me when she says that...?)
Commemorative Photo
Penny:
Ah. It's the photo that John brought.
Kay:
Who took this photo?
Penny:
The camera has a self-timer. We took it with just the three of us.
Edgeworth:
So, about the third person... Just who is in that Moozilla costume in the background?
Penny:
That's... actually, rather than me telling you, it'd be better if you found out for yourself. I think they'll be outside the studio lot, so if you get a chance later, please go there.
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Later... huh. Understood. We'll do that.
John Marsh
John:
............
Edgeworth:
John was it? Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?
John:
...Hey old man, you really a prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
Yes. (Hmph. Old man...?)
John:
Then, first show me your prosecutor's badge.
Edgeworth:
I don't have my badge with me right now...
John:
Then, you can't prove you're a prosecutor, old man.
Edgeworth:
Ngh!
Kay:
Hmm. This kind is a tough nut to crack, isn't he? Want me to give it a try?
Edgeworth:
Yes. I'm counting on you Kay. (I'm not good with kids...)
John Marsh
Kay:
So John, you're an actor?
John:
.....Yeah. What about it?
Kay:
You're amazing! That's so cool!
John:
.....N-Not really.
Edgeworth:
(Hmph. Good grief. At least that seems to have worked.)
Kay:
Umm, about those horns...
John:
...Wh-What about them?
Penny:
John's horns are specially made prosthetics. John plays a young boy who has a special connection with Moozilla. He can communicate with Moozilla using those horns. Right, John?
John:
Shut up. Stop blabbering about that stupid stuff!
Penny:
Ooh... S-Sorry.
Edgeworth:
(I think I'm beginning to see the kind of relationship these two have...)
Kay:
But it must be amazing! To star in a movie! And you're only in elementary school!
John:
Penny:
Ah! D-Despite how he looks, John is 13 years old and he's already in middle school...
Kay:
Whaaat! But... he's so small. And he's wearing a kiddy backpack!
Penny:
The backpack is a part of his costume. He's an actor, after all.
Kay:
I-I see. But... he's still really tiny.
Penny:
I-It's probably better if you didn't talk about his height in front of...
John:
I thought I told you to stop blabbering about stupid stuff!
Penny:
S-Sorry!
Edgeworth:
(It seems the only thing that's not a prop is that milk carton.)
The president (appears after John Marsh)
John:
That guy over there... He's the president, right?
Kay:
Yup. Do you know him?
John:
.....Yeah. I've met him before.
Edgeworth:
(This boy... has met with the president?)
John:
.....Hmph. That guy makes me sick.
Kay:
Th-That's not a very nice thing to say. Why do you hate the president so much?
John:
........
Kay:
Huh... And now he's giving me the silent treatment...
Penny:
U-Um! The truth is, the president was involved in the film.
Edgeworth:
The president was involved in the film? What do you mean?
Penny:
He was supposed to have a brief cameo in the movie. He came by to look around the set some time ago. That was when he met with John.
Edgeworth:
Why would the president be appearing in this film?
Penny:
We heard he was a fan of the original Moozilla series... And so we made him an offer. We thought it would make great publicity, you see.
John:
...He comes on the movie set like he's on some sightseeing tour. It's so annoying.
Penny:
John, you really shouldn't say stuff like that. It's not nice.
John:
...Shut it.
Edgeworth:
(I guess he couldn't tolerate having an amateur appear in his film...)
Present
Monster Movie Flyer, Moozilla's Head, Moozilla Doll, or Commemorative Photo
John:
Moozilla only exists in the movies... For it to become an actual incident... The thought never even crossed my mind.
Edgeworth:
John. I'd like you to cooperate with the investigation.
John:
Hmph. In that case, maybe you should make me care enough to cooperate, old man.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... He's not very approachable.)
Kay:
John! If you cooperate with us, I'll give you some delicious candy!
John:
You think that'll work on me? Don't treat me like a kid!
Kay:
Aww. Even my candy crush attack didn't work. What a bummer.
Edgeworth:
(...Candy crush attack?)
Anything else
John:
What's that supposed to be? Giving me that isn't gonna land you a role in the film.
Edgeworth:
(I wasn't showing it to you so that I could be in the movie...)
Kay:
Hmm... So then, what do we have to do appear in the movie?
Edgeworth:
...Kay, let's just leave it at that, shall we?
(Clearing all "Talk" option leads to:)
Penny:
......
John:
......Oh, right. Here.
Penny:
What's this? Ah, was this from yesterday?
Edgeworth:
(A photo...?)
John:
...Yeah. Since it was developed, I brought it along with me. You can have it.
Penny:
I think it turned out quite nicely! So you brought it all the way here for me? Thank you so much.
John:
...No, not really. I just happened to have it with me.
Edgeworth:
Excuse me, but... May I take a quick look at it?
Penny:
Oh, sure. Here you go!
Edgeworth:
(So this was taken yesterday... Neither the hoofprints nor the body are in it.)
Commemorative Photo data jotted down in my Organizer.
(Connecting all possible Logic, examining ground around the body, original Moozilla model and table, clearing all "Talk" options of Penny and John, and talking with Lotta leads to:)
Investigation Complete
Edgeworth:
And with that, this portion of the investigation seems to be finished.
Kay:
So the murder weapon really is...
Edgeworth:
Yes. As it stands now, the possibility that it was the monster head is quite high.
Kay:
So he ended up being squashed by the falling head, huh...
Edgeworth:
Hm?
Lang:
Although they're extremely late to the party, the bodyguards and the police have finally arrived.
Bodyguard:
Mr. President!
Lang:
They really were... far too late.
Bodyguard:
Damn it! Who did this!?
Lang:
...They'll pay for this. I swear I'll make them pay. But you know, this much is enough to put me at ease. The person who did this to Huang... ...I've already got my eye on a suspect.
Edgeworth:
What? What do you mean?
Lang:
Even though Huang was the victim, he doesn't have extraterritorial rights here. Your country's police have the right to investigate. However, I've already spoken with them. As an agent of Interpol, they're letting me assist in the investigation...
Edgeworth:
...So they've already established a plan for this investigation?
Lang:
I've already found my prey. Now it's time for the hunt... ...Take a look at this. It's a printout from a security camera on the Grand Tower rooftop.
Edgeworth:
Th... This is!
Lang:
This camera records people as they get off the rooftop elevator. And guess who was recorded? The president and his killer can be clearly seen!
Kay:
Wh-Why is Ms. Courtney there!?
Edgeworth:
(So he's saying Judge Courtney is the murder?)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste!
Edgeworth:
(Could she, who hates crime more than anyone, have...?)
Security Camera Photo jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
...Agent Lang. I'd like to hear your thoughts.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
............ Just now, I heard a rumor at the Grand Tower. Miles Edgeworth, that you... are no longer a "prosecutor".
Edgeworth:
!
Lang:
Naturally, that means you don't even have a shred of investigate authority. So what would be the point of having a logic battle with someone like you?
Edgeworth:
(Hmph...!)
Kay:
Why would you say something like that!? Didn't you also just get reduced to being a lone agent!?
Lang:
.......... Hey. Answer me this. Even though you've lost your position as a "prosecutor"... ...why are you sticking your neck into this case?
Edgeworth:
........ (Why do I still continue to investigate...?) Agent Lang... Why are you pursuing the criminal who murdered the president? Because you're an Interpol agent?
Lang:
..........
Edgeworth:
Right now, I am also chasing after a certain person. Someone in the shadows, who was behind the murder at the Grand Tower yesterday... Someone who placed Kay in grave danger. ...Even now, they are lurking somewhere, laughing at us. We will uncover the truth, and bring them to justice... ...and a title such as "prosecutor" has nothing to do with it. As long as the truth remains hidden... ...I will continue to seek out that truth. For that is a part of my creed.
Lang:
........Haha! You... You're always trying to be so clever, but you really are kind of an idiot.
Edgeworth:
(Hmph. Me, an idiot? How rude...)
Lang:
That's the answer I wanted to hear. ...Alright, I'll play along with you for a bit. I've lost all my men, and you've lost your title. And yet, we still continue to investigate... Let's begin this battle of logic between two kindred spirits!
Edgeworth:
You have my thanks...
Lang:
However, I won't go easy on you. I'll definitely catch the criminal who murdered Huang. And I won't let you get in my way!
Edgeworth:
Yes... I wouldn't have it any other way!
Lang:
Let me show you the truth that this wolf has sunk his fangs into!
-- Why Courtney? --
Lang:
Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower.
Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot.
At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two.
There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president!
Edgeworth:
It was just the two of them alone on the rooftop... No bodyguards?
Lang:
Yeah. I confirmed it with those bodyguards over there. They didn't know about it either. Guess he managed to give them the slip. He must've had something secret to talk about.
Edgeworth:
(President Huang and Judge Courtney... Did those two have some sort of connection?)
Lang:
Apparently, he had an arrangement with the owner of the Grand Tower. He requested the entrance to the viewing platform be restricted so that they could be alone. Well, it's not like the owner could turn down a request from the president.
Kay:
Does that mean... the last person to see the president was...
Lang:
Exactly... Courtney, you mean? It's gotta be her!
Edgeworth:
(Agent Lang's reasoning is certainly sound... However, he has overlooked one major thing...! ...and that's where I must strike!)
Rebuttal
-- Why Courtney? --
Lang:
Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower.

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
How can you be so sure that the two actually met?
Lang:
Hmph. Attacking right off the bat... Your fighter's instinct, it's not bad. Trying to keep me in check from the opening move. Impressive.
Edgeworth:
(No, that wasn't exactly my intention...)
Lang:
Still, Mr. Prosecutor, I've only just begun. So why don't you pipe down and listen up?
Lang:
Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Two nights ago...? Are you certain?
Lang:
Hmph! If you doubt me, then take a look for yourself! This picture was taken by the security camera on the roof of the Grand Tower... This was undoubtedly taken the night before last!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
All this picture shows is that they went to the rooftop together. There's no indication of what transpired afterwards.
Lang:
The security cameras were only installed in front of the elevator. There's nothing to show what happened on the viewing platform, but... ...I'm certain of it! That was when the crime took place!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. If the president really was murdered two nights ago... ...it would mean that the body has been here ever since.)
Lang:
What's wrong, Mr. Prosecutor? Something on your mind? But, it's not over yet. I'm just getting started.
Present Commemorative Photo
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Shi-Long Lang... For the Interpol agent with the highest arrest rate to have fallen so low."
Lang:
At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Someone could have been hiding on the viewing platform!
Kay:
That's right! There was even a cotton candy stall up there!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
The owner of the building had been secretly contacted by the president. He could ill-afford any slip ups, so the owner frantically made sure secrecy was maintained. Everyone and everything was cleared out, including the sugar for the cotton candy!
Kay:
E... Even the sugar...? That's just too cruel!
Lang:
However, it was all for naught. The president still met his end...
Lang:
There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Do you really think there is no room for doubt?
Lang:
Heh! Of course I do! The time, the place... Everything points to that woman committing the crime!
Edgeworth:
I see. The time and the place, everything... huh? (The time following the president's death and where his body was found... It seems I have reached the heart of the matter.)
Edgeworth:
(Agent Lang has overlooked something major...! ...and that's where I must strike!)
Edgeworth:
Shi-Long Lang... For the Interpol agent with the highest arrest rate to have fallen so low.
Lang:
What'd you say...!?
Edgeworth:
This is a commemorative photo taken by the staff at Global Studios.
Kay:
Everyone's got such great smiles! ...Well, except for John.
Edgeworth:
This photo was taken yesterday.
Lang:
What!?
Edgeworth:
If Judge Courtney had murdered the president two days ago... ...then his body should have been there when this photo was taken!
Lang:
Owwoooooooh!
Lang:
Heh. Perhaps you should have listened a bit more carefully to those involved in the case. Questioning witnesses is one of the basic fundamentals of an investigation, is it not?
Kay:
I've captured Mr. Edgeworth's great smile! You really do look most alive when you're cornering your opponent!
Lang:
Grr... Just as I expected. It's been a while since I've felt like this.
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, haven't you been a little hasty in your reasoning?
Lang:
........Tch. I don't need your advice. Lang Zi says: "The wrath of a wolf lasts a hundred years." My anger towards the woman who killed the president cannot be suppressed.
Edgeworth:
I, too, wish to capture the culprit. However... ...there is no doubt that the body appeared here last night. Therefore... the president could not have fallen to his death.
Kay:
Yeah! He was crushed by the monster head!
Edgeworth:
The crime occurred here at the film lot, not on the rooftop of the Grand Tower.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
So, that's what you think. Still, I don't intend to stray from my logic either.
Edgeworth:
However, he could not have fallen to his death two nights ago. This photo proves that...
Lang:
Is that so? Think about it this way... Two nights ago, Courtney pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body.
Edgeworth:
In here?
Lang:
Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Once we search this area, we'll know where she hid the body.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, there is no need for a search.
Lang:
What'd you say!?
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence proves that Judge Courtney could not have hidden the body!
Present Combination Lock
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"All the entrances to the film lot were locked."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor. That's the evidence you were talking about?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. If you look at this piece of evidence, you'll see that Judge Courtney could not have...
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor, you'd better get that thing out of my face. Arguing about pointless objects is a waste of my time!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (So this wasn't it!)
Kay:
Mr. Lang says that Ms. Courtney moved the body, but... ...wouldn't it be impossible for Ms. Courtney to enter the film lot in the first place?
Edgeworth:
(Whether Judge Courtney could have entered the crime scene or not... Don't I have a piece of evidence which proves that?)
Lang:
It was that woman who moved the body. Ready to admit defeat, Mr. Prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
No, Agent Lang. That is impossible.
Leads back to:
"This piece of evidence proves that Judge Courtney could not have hidden the body!"
Edgeworth:
All the entrances to the film lot were locked. The chain on the back entrance was only cut last night.
Lang:
What!?
Edgeworth:
Therefore, Judge Courtney could not have entered the film lot two nights ago!
Lang:
Aiyaaaaa! But the president could only have fallen two nights ago!
Edgeworth:
...Why are you so insistent that the crime occurred two days ago?
Lang:
Why...? Because there's still more to the security camera footage.
-- Why Courtney? Pt. 2 --
Lang:
A photo was recorded 10-20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman.
That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone.
After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all!
There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there?
Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is!
Edgeworth:
The president never came down from the rooftop?
Lang:
That's right. The security camera is always watching the entrance of the elevator. It was specifically set up to record anyone who entered or exited the rooftop. Essentially, the camera created a locked room... one which the president vanished from!
Edgeworth:
(A locked room... I see. This is quite an unfavorable piece of evidence for Judge Courtney...)
Security Camera Photo data updated in my Organizer.
Kay:
A rooftop escape! That's a difficult feat!
Edgeworth:
So even the Yatagarasu can't just fly through the sky.
Kay:
That's right. I... I still need more training to be able to pull that off.
Edgeworth:
(Are you saying you're going to train yourself to fly?)
Rebuttal
-- Why Courtney? Pt. 2 --
Lang:
A photo was recorded 10-20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
"10-20 minutes"... That's rather vague.
Lang:
The problem here isn't when it happened. At least, not right now. What's important is what that woman did after that.
Edgeworth:
...What Judge Courtney did? Could you tell me about it in more detail?
Lang:
Hmph. That's what I was going to do.
Lang:
That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you certain she was alone in the elevator?
Lang:
Yeah, I'm sure. It'd been 10-20 minutes after they went up to the roof... The security camera by the elevator only recorded that woman. She was definitely alone. I saw it with my own two eyes!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... Judge Courtney returned alone on the elevator. This point seems to be accurate.)
Kay:
Hmm, that's strange. Isn't Ms. Courtney always together with the Goddess of Law?
Edgeworth:
In this case, we aren't counting ethereal beings.
Kay:
Aww. Poor Goddess of Law. We should give her an offering to lift her spirits!
Edgeworth:
...Returning to the topic at hand... Agent Lang, could the president have used the elevator after Judge Courtney?
Lang:
Yeah. I thought of that too. However...
Lang:
After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Just to be sure... the camera didn't have any blind spots or malfunctions, right?
Lang:
You think I'd make a mistake like that? Are you mocking my investigation?
Edgeworth:
No. It is simply my nature to question everything.
Lang:
Tch! At any rate, this footage can be trusted. I'm sure of that. The persistent took the elevator on the way up with that woman, but he never came back down!
Edgeworth:
Understood. While I reserve judgment on your logic, I shall trust in your investigation.
Lang:
Oh, is that how it is? Do what you want. ...It won't change a thing.
Lang:
There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
And if there were, in fact, some other way besides the elevator...?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
From the roof of a 50-story building? Hah! That's ridiculous. Without the elevator, there's no way to go down, let alone get off the viewing platform. You'll need something better than that to break my logic!
Edgeworth:
(A way to get off the rooftop viewing platform, without using the elevator...)
Lang:
How about it, Mr. Prosecutor? Do you understand now? There is no reason for the president to be lying sprawled out on the pavement here...
Present Grand Tower
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"If memory serves me correctly..."
Lang:
Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. It's still too early to make that conclusion.
Lang:
Hmph. No matter how much you struggle, there's no escape from my fangs.
Edgeworth:
I wonder about that. Perhaps there is a hidden route... ...that allows us to escape from the locked room and your fangs simultaneously.
Kay:
Whoa! The proclamation of a miraculous escape! Even a Great Thief's gotta pay attention!
Lang:
Now you've said it, Mr. Prosecutor. If that's what you think, then show me... ...that "hidden route" of yours!
Edgeworth:
(A locked room created by the security camera... Is falling off the roof really the only way to escape this locked room?)
Edgeworth:
As a matter of fact, there was one. A hidden route... that is.
Lang:
A way down without using the elevator!? You'd better not tell me he flew off or something!
Edgeworth:
There's no need for that. It's quite simple. The president just needed to know... ...about the existence of the hidden 51st floor.
Lang:
The 51st floor?
Edgeworth:
This building has a hidden 51st floor. It is accessible through a secret hatch on the rooftop. Using that route, it would be possible to leave the rooftop without using the elevator.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hidden room? Secret hatch? How could the president have even known about that?
Edgeworth:
I wonder? I don't know the answer myself. I am merely raising a possibility.
Lang:
In the first place, what's this all about? This hidden 51st floor. Sounds like something that ninja girl over there would love to get into!
Kay:
No way! I'm sick of that place!
Edgeworth:
(For Kay, that place only holds bad memories, after all.) The 51st floor was a secret storeroom for the black market auction. Its true purpose was only exposed yesterday.
Lang:
...Black market auction? You... You aren't suggesting the president was involved in something like that, are you?
Edgeworth:
I have no proof. However, the possibility exists, does it not?
Kay:
Hmm. I wouldn't put it past that president.
Lang:
HOOOOOOOOOOWWWL!
Kay:
Eek!
Lang:
Impossible! The president would never...! He would never be involved in a black market auction!
Edgeworth:
(Wh... What's this?)
Lang:
You punks. Are you prepared? If you're gonna spout nonsense like that... I'll tear you into pieces!
Kay:
Eeeeeek!
Edgeworth:
(...She ran away.)
Lang:
You don't have any idea! The amount of respect that man has earned from his country's people!
Edgeworth:
(I see... We have seen the president's true colors. However, the people of Zheng Fa remain in the dark... Should I inform Agent Lang of the president's true nature? No. Telling him now would only further cloud his judgment...) I understand, Agent Lang. Please calm down. We spoke out of line... I apologize.
Lang:
......Sorry. My emotions got the best of me. And Kay, how long do you plan on hiding? You can come out now.
Kay:
...I'm sorry.
Lang:
...It's fine. My anger is directed towards the president's killer.
Lotta:
Well, I'll be! Yer actually a pretty good guy, ain't ya? That loyalty to yer president! It's mighty admirable!
Lang:
Heh. What's it to you?
Lotta:
Aww, don't be like that. I've got some good news for ya, I reckon.
Lang:
What?
Lotta:
The president ain't never passed through the 51st floor. Ya can count on me!
Lang:
Really?
Lotta:
I was in the storeroom myself, and I saw it with my very own eyes!
Edgeworth:
(That's right... She snuck into the storeroom that day.)
Lotta's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.
Lang:
...Thanks. ...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
What is it?
Lang:
I don't intend to give the culprit a single step of leeway. No one's seen the president since he met with Courtney two days ago.
Edgeworth:
That doesn't change the fact that the body wasn't here yesterday. If he were pushed off two days ago, it would be odd that he wasn't found until yesterday. I doubt a fall from the rood would take a whole day.
Lang:
I'll admit, there are a few things I still haven't figured out.
Edgeworth:
Regardless... there is one thing I am certain of.
Kay:
There is?
Edgeworth:
What exactly occurred here last night? I'm certain we'll have to look into that in order to uncover the truth.
Kay:
Because the body and the hoofprints could have only appeared last night, right?
Officer:
Agent Lang! We'd like to bring the body in for the autopsy...
Lang:
Huang..... It's in your hands. Make sure you show the proper respect.
Officer:
I also have one more thing to report...
Lang:
What is it?
Officer:
We found some footprints near the body! Umm... They were left within the area that looks like a monster's footprint.
Edgeworth:
(There were human footprints within the monster's footprint?)
Lang:
What kind of footprints?
Officer:
Sir! They were the footprints of a child! About the size of an elementary school student!
Edgeworth:
What!?
Penny:
Huh!?
Kay:
A-An elementary school student!? Wait... Could it be...?
Edgeworth:
(Who... was that?)
Penny:
U-Umm...!
Edgeworth:
(Ms. Nichols?)
Penny:
I... I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you! Please excuse my rudeness!
Edgeworth:
Is there something you want to say? (What is she so scared of?)
Penny:
I'm worried that you'll think poorly of me, but... ...please let me testify something! It's really important!
Edgeworth:
(That's not something you need to be so worried about...) What is it?
Penny:
Last night... I... I actually came here.
Lang:
What!?
Penny:
Eek!
Edgeworth:
Why did you come here?
Penny:
...Well, I got a little worried, so I stopped by... ...to check up on John.
Edgeworth:
John... You mean John Marsh? (As I thought...)
Penny:
Yes. Last night, umm... John stayed here late in order to practice by myself.
Kay:
Wow! He's really dedicated!
Penny:
Well, this movie is the first time he's starring as the lead role, so... ...I'm sure he wants to do his best...!
Edgeworth:
(She must have witnessed something last night...) When was this?
Penny:
Umm... If I remember correctly, I think it was a little past 10 PM. It looked like it was going to rain, and I was getting worried, so I came to check up on him. And when I got here... Well... I, umm...
Lang:
You... saw something?
Penny:
.....Y-Yes. John was practicing by himself... ...and right above his head... I saw... a long... long... neck.
Kay:
A neck?
Penny:
Y-Yes! Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile... It was like... the neck of a dinosaur!
Lotta:
Whooooooahhh there! C-Could that've been... ...G-G-Gourdy!? Last time I went huntin' for it, it was a bust... but I reckon, this could be the real deal!
Kay:
What!? So this time it's Gourdy!?
Penny:
Th-That's right! I was really surprised! A-After all, John is the boy who can communicate with Moozilla!
Lotta:
Yeah! That's right! Them horns of his lets him hear what the monster's sayin', right?
Penny:
E-Even so! He was looking up at Gourdy's face and he was talking to it! It was like they were friends! D-Doesn't that sound weird!?
Lotta:
You said it, sister! That's pretty darn strange, I reckon! That boy's a little traitor!
Edgeworth:
(...It seems she's gotten reality mixed up with the movies...)
Lang:
Hey, Missy... Did you really see that?
Penny:
Yes! But I was so shocked, I immediately ran home after that.
Lang:
What do you make of this, Mr. Prosecutor? Has another monster taken the stage?
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang... Do you really believe this absurd testimony?
Lang:
Hahahahaha! I couldn't care less about the monsters. However, it looks like who we need to talk to next has been decided now, hasn't it?
Edgeworth:
John Marsh... He was here last night. It's very likely he saw something... isn't it?
Lang:
Atta boy!
Lang:
John Marsh...! We've got some questions for you!
................
Penny:
U-Umm... John kind of left a while ago.
Lang:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Kay:
L-Let's go after him!
April 6, 10:54 AMOutside Grand TowerTower Plaza
Lang:
Tch! Where'd he run off to!?
Edgeworth:
He might have just gone back home.
Kay:
That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today!
Lang:
...Or he may have run away.
Kay:
A-Aren't you just overthinking things?
Edgeworth:
He's still a child. I can't imagine that he could have murdered the president by himself.
Lang:
Who said he was alone? Maybe that monster helped him. That boy can summon a monster to his aid, right?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Very funny.
Lang:
I'm not saying that kid's definitely the culprit. But right now, he's the most prominent witness we have, So, we'll need to find that brat.
Gumshoe:
Ah! Mr. Edgeworth!
Kay:
Ah! Gummy!
Gumshoe:
Uuugh... I, I... I...!
Kay:
He ran away...
Edgeworth:
(What is the detective doing...?)
Lang:
It doesn't matter... It's not like I can rely on this country's police anyways.
Edgeworth:
...Agent Lang. Do you intend to continue investigating by yourself?
Lang:
Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that?
Kay:
Didn't you always have a small army of subordinates with you before?
Lang:
That's right... But, you know, being a lone wolf isn't all that bad. You don't have to worry about your subordinates or partners. All you need are your fangs. Simple, right?
Edgeworth:
(Subordinates... and partners...?)
Lang:
Well then. I'll be seeing you two.
Lotta:
He he he he. Things are gettin' interestin'! I reckon I'm about to get real busy myself! After all, I got me a pair of monsters to hunt! I'm definitely gettin' my hands on this scoop!
Kay:
Things have gotten pretty crazy, haven't they?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. There's the footprints of Moozilla, and now the shadow of Gourdy... It's almost exactly like the movie.
Kay:
How about we go monster hunting too?
Edgeworth:
Well... (Hm? Isn't that...?)
Kay:
Isn't that one of Lang's men...?
Edgeworth:
(He's one of Agent Lang's subordinates. We met him during another case.) Excuse me...
MIB:
Oh, Prosecutor Edgeworth. It has been a while.
Kay:
Shouldn't you be following Mr. Lang?
MIB:
Agent Lang... Shifu... is no longer my boss.
Edgeworth:
What exactly happened?
MIB:
Do you remember the incident from one month ago?
Edgeworth:
(The "Yatagarasu Incident" we had been involved with.)
MIB:
Agent Lang made a major mistake back then. He almost aided and abetted a dangerous criminal.
Edgeworth:
(Certainly... it had come quite close to that at the time.)
MIB:
Shifu took responsibility for what happened... and our team was disbanded.
Kay:
Disbanded...?
Edgeworth:
So that's what Agent Lang was talking about when he said he had become a lone wolf.
Kay:
Then... Why are you here?
MIB:
That's..... Well. I was a little worried about Shifu. ...It seems that even now, he's still chasing after them. The ghosts of 12 years past...
Edgeworth:
Ghosts of 12 years past? Just what are you...
MIB:
.......... I'm sorry. I've already said too much. If you'll excuse me...
Edgeworth:
(These ghosts Agent Lang is chasing after... Do they also have something to do with this case?)
Kay:
Looks like everyone's left now... So, what do we do now?
Edgeworth:
Well... Ms. Hart is going after the monsters, and Agent Lang is going after John. We should also try approaching this case from a different angle.
Kay:
What angle would that be?
Edgeworth:
...We should listen to what Judge Courtney has to say.
Kay:
Ah! That's right! If I'm not mistaken, Ms. Courtney is...
Courtney:
...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Patricia Roland's trial.
Kay:
She said that she had a trial coming up!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Let's head to the courthouse as well.
Kay:
'Kay!
To be continued.
April 6, 11:23 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3
Courtney:
Court is now in session. Is the defense ready?
Ray:
Of course, Your Honor! We can begin whenever you want.
Franziska:
The prosecution has been ready from the start, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
Jill Crane, the attorney in charge of the defense, has passed on from this world. Furthermore, Sebastian Debeste, the prosecutor-in-charge, has disappeared... And so, Franziska and Mr. Shields have taken over their duties.
Courtney:
Before we begin, I would like to apologize for the delay of today's trial. As the crime took place in the prison, a place where justice is normally administered... ...and the defendant was the warden of the prison, further exacerbating the situation... ...additional time was specially arranged to investigate and prepare for the trial. In addition, the defense attorney in charge of the case, Jill Crane, has recently passed away... Due to these circumstances, the trial was further delayed. Mr. Shields, Ms. von Karma. At this time, I'd like to give you my gratitude for taking up this responsibility on short notice.
Ray:
I guess this is the last job Courtney-pie's friend left behind for us, huh? Well, Uncle Ray's more than happy to help out. Although having said that, I only had enough time to skim through the case files... Are you OK on your end, Franny-pie?
Franziska:
What kind of prosecutor abandons his own case and vanishes without a trace...!? I won't allow any more delays in this trial while we wait for that foolish man to return. I have received the evidence just now. There should be no problem continuing the trial.
Courtney:
...You have my thanks. And with that, I hereby call the defendant, Patricia Roland, to the stand.
Roland:
........
Courtney:
Now then, will the prosecution please give us their opening statement?
Franziska:
Very well, Your Honor. The defendant...
Hold it!
Roland:
...Please wait, Your Honor.
Courtney:
What is it?
Roland:
Well, there's something I'd like you to fill me in on. Just what exactly... am I doing in a place like this?
Courtney:
Then perhaps... you would do well to listen to the opening statement.
Roland:
Hmm. So if I listen to it, I'll get it, huh? OK then, let's hear it.
Franziska:
...That was the plan from the start. Now, if you would kindly shut up and listen. The incident occurred in the detention center and the prison Warden Roland is in charge of. The victim is Horace Knightley, who was being held in the detention center. The prosecution is certain that this woman here is the culprit. This knife, the murder weapon, is the decisive evi..... Huh!?
Courtney:
Ms. von Karma. Is something wrong?
Franziska:
Th-That's... impossible! The evidence is...!
Ray:
What's wrong with the evidence, Franny-pie?
Franziska:
The evidence... the knife's gone! The chisel with Dogen's bell attached to it is missing too!
Ray:
Wh... Whaaat!?
Courtney:
Order! Order! Prosecutor von Karma. What is the meaning of this?
Franziska:
I... I don't understand it either, Your Honor.
Roland:
If there's no evidence, then I suppose there's not much reason for me to be here. Some prosecutor. Can't even hold on to one little piece of evidence. What a dunce.
Franziska:
I... I only received everything that the previous prosecutor had... Ah!
Ray:
...It appears the culprit is that pampered prosecutor, the Boy Blunder. Hey, Courtney-pie.
Courtney:
What is it?
Ray:
Your Honor! Considering our predicament, what say we postpone the trial until later?
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
The defense's proposal is overruled.
Ray:
Eh? Courtney-pie...?
Roland:
I know, right? It'd be troubling for me if this trial were to be delayed any further. I just want everyone to know that I'm innocent. As soon as possible.
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Innocent!? I've had more than enough of your foolish...
Objection!
Roland:
And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... "In court, evidence is everything." Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor?
Courtney:
.......... That is correct.
Franziska:
Eh!
Ray:
What!?
Courtney:
The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Patricia Roland...
Ray:
Objection!
Ray:
Hold your horses, Courtney-pie! You can't just declare her innocent all of a sudden!
Courtney:
Is something the matter? For the defense to object to a "not guilty" verdict...
Ray:
Well, I mean... Even you must know that the warden over there is guilty, right? You were there with us when we found the murder weapon!
Courtney:
........ Mr. Shields. A judge must remain impartial when handing down a verdict. That is why I cannot allow myself to get caught up in my own personal feelings... The person who was present when the murder weapon was discovered... ...and the judge sitting before you now, are two completely different people.
Ray:
...You're kidding, right?
Courtney:
I can only hand down a verdict based upon the evidence that was presented.
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
There is evidence! It's just... Well, it's not here right now, but... A few minutes, that's all I need! I'll find the evidence and return to court, without fail! The prosecution requests a brief recess, Your Honor!
Courtney:
........
Ray:
Th-The defense would also like a recess, Your Honor. Courtney-pie. Please...
Courtney:
........ ...I understand. I shall grant your request.
Roland:
Well! Justine-darling! Aren't you wishy-washy today?
Courtney:
This court will now adjourn for a 15 minute recess! During with, the prosecution and the defense shall prepare for the resumption of the trial.
Franziska:
...Understood, Your Honor.
Ray:
Phew. That was a close one.
Courtney:
Court is now adjourned!
April 6, 11:38 AMDistrict Court3rd Floor Lobby
Kay:
Didn't we find it together!? The evidence!
Edgeworth:
Yes, we certainly did.
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
What's the matter, Detective?
Gumshoe:
It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator.
Kay:
Really! Why?
Edgeworth:
(Of course, that's why the metal detector reacted!) Judge Courtney, I'd like you to take a look at this.
Courtney:
The chisel...?
Debeste:
Wasn't that just the fake murder weapon?
Edgeworth:
Dogen hid this chisel inside this dog's mouth. And the real murder weapon was hidden in very much the same way...
Roland:
...!
Edgeworth:
The real murder weapon is in the pond, inside the alligator!
Edgeworth:
I wonder if it was stolen by someone...
???:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Berry and Mr. Keyes. Did you come to attend the trial?
Regina:
I came because I heard there's a really fun show around here! So, where is it?
Simon:
The trial for the case I got caught up in was supposed to have already started, but... ..our practice ran a little late. I believe it was somewhere around here, wasn't it?
Kay:
Actually, two key pieces of evidence have gone missing: the chisel and the knife... The trial is in recess now. Sort of like an intermission. You just missed it, Simon.
Simon:
Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Wh-wh-wh-what's that supposed to mean!?
Regina:
Ah ha ha! Looks like Simon's going to get arrested again!
Simon:
Eeeeeeeeeek! Nowaynowaynoway, I can't...!
Kay:
Hmm. I guess Simon is his usual noisy self. ...Huh?
???:
To think that I would be humiliated like this!
Edgeworth:
...And here comes another noisy individual.
Ray:
Now, now, Franny-pie. Let's just take a moment and calm down a bit. Maybe you could put that whip of yours away, him? Whaddaya say?
Franziska:
That foolish prosecutor! When I get my hands on him... ...my whip is going to give him the thrashing of a lifetime!
Ray:
Eek! Miles, why don't you try talking to her?
Edgeworth:
(Good grief... On that note, I guess I should probably hear what she has to say.)
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Notice anything?
Kay:
I can't believe the evidence went missing! We really did find the murder weapon, that knife, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It was in the alligator's mouth.
Kay:
I wonder if someone took it with them?
Edgeworth:
We cannot deny that possibility.
Kay:
Let's ask everyone involved with the case! We might find out something!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Let's do just that.
The trial
Kay:
Don't you think today's trial felt kind of strange? The defendant, Ms. Roland, was awfully relaxed.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It was as if she always knew the evidence had gone missing.
Kay:
And Ms. Courtney seemed different from usual too.
Edgeworth:
There may be something at work behind the scenes during today's trial.
Doors on left and middle
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Where do you think you're going?
Edgeworth:
No, I wasn't going anywhere. I was just examining the door.
Kay:
Ah, I see. It's the #1 rule of a Great Thief: "Ensure your escape route." Good thinking! If you wanna become the Yatagarasu's assistant, all you gotta do is ask. Since it's you, I'll let you skip the written exam and skills test. I'll hire you on the spot!
Edgeworth:
...Th-That's quite alright. I appreciate the sentiment.
Bulletin board
Edgeworth:
The schedule for upcoming trials has been posted on this bulletin board. Of course, Patricia Roland's trial is listed as well.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. If we can't find the missing evidence...
Edgeworth:
Yes. It will be a serious problem. Let's try talking with Franziska and Mr. Shields.
Water fountain
Edgeworth:
There's a notice posted in front of the water fountain. "Step on the pedal to enjoy amazingly delicious water. However... ...once it starts flowing, it will never stop again. So please be prepared." (So this fountain is basically out of service...)
Kay:
...Alright. Let's do this! Are you prepared!?
Edgeworth:
Calm yourself, Kay.
Franziska von Karma
Franziska:
Oh? If it isn't "former" prosecutor Miles Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Franziska.
Franziska:
Those who have abandoned the path of a prosecutor do not belong here. Now be a good boy and go home. Figure out what you want to do with your life!
The trial
Edgeworth:
Still, what are you going to do, Franziska? The recess is only 15 minutes.
Franziska:
Grr... You're always so calm and collected... like an anchorman reading off a teleprompter... It makes me sick!
Edgeworth:
(...I should probably stay classy and avoid a confrontation with her for now.)
Knightley's murder
Edgeworth:
Franziska. I never expected you to end up taking over the prosecution for this case.
Franziska:
The bodyguard of the president of Zheng Fa, Horace Knightley, was murdered. The defendant is the former warden of the prison, Patricia Roland. The knife she used as the murder weapon had been prepared as evidence.
Edgeworth:
However, the murder weapon has disappeared without a trace.
Franziska:
Not only did he abandon his own case, but he also made me look like a fool in court...
Edgeworth:
Ngh!
Franziska:
The next time I see that foolish fool of a prosecutor, I'll whip some backbone into him!
Edgeworth:
(I don't mind if you whip some backbone into him... but stop whipping innocent bystanders!)
Present
Yatagarasu's Badge
Franziska:
Is that supposed to be a replacement for your prosecutor's badge? It certainly suits you, Miles Edgeworth!
Kay:
Hold it! This badge suits me way more than it does Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(When did this become a competition?)
Letter from Unknown or Grand Tower
Franziska:
Kay Faraday. Have you had any more problems with your memory since your recovery?
Kay:
Nope! I remember everything perfectly now! Including... ...how I secretly wanted to steal a closer look at your whipping technique!
Franziska:
...Interesting. If you want to see it that badly, I'll show it to you!
Edgeworth:
Argh! (Wh-Why me!?)
Kay:
Ahhh! So close! I felt like I was almost about to see through it. One more time, Ms. von Karma! Show it to me one more time! Pretty please!
Franziska:
Very well. Since you asked so politely.
Edgeworth:
Could you two please stop this at once? Pretty please...
Crime Scene Notes
Franziska:
Th... This is...? Zheng Fa's...!
Edgeworth:
Yes. The president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang. We discovered his body... just recently.
Franziska:
Wh-What are you saying!? There must be some kind of mistake!
Edgeworth:
No, I confirmed it with my own eyes. There was no mistake.
Franziska:
Then, this incident... Could it have something to do with my trial?
Edgeworth:
No, it is nothing of the sort. We just came here to speak with Judge Courtney...
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! Are you trying to distract me by showing me evidence that is unrelated to this trial!?
Edgeworth:
Ngh! M-My apologies. It seems I shouldn't have shown it to you.
Franziska:
Shouldn't have shown it to me? Are you trying to conceal the incident from me!?
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (J-Just what do you want from me!?)
Anything else
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! Unlike you, I am actually busy. I don't have the time to look at something like that. Why don't you just look at that evidence again by yourself?
Edgeworth:
(She is certainly... as harsh as ever.)
Courthouse model
Kay:
It's a model of the courthouse. It's really well made!
Edgeworth:
Hmm. There's something written on the information panel. "Press the button to activate robot transformation sequence. Reservation required to view the transformation show. Please inquire at front desk." (This model courthouse... transforms into a robot?)
Kay:
M-Mr. Edgeworth, umm...
Edgeworth:
(Hm? She's unusually quiet. I thought she'd make a fuss about wanting to see it.)
Kay:
If the model can transform, does that mean that this courthouse can also...
Edgeworth:
Kay. I assure you, that's not possible. (...But, perhaps there is more to this courthouse than meets the eye.)
Raymond Shields
Ray:
Kay! Looks like you've gotten your memories back!
Kay:
Yeah! I'm all better now!
Ray:
Uncle Ray was really worried, you know. ...Though that "other" Kay was also pretty cute. Well then, now that you've recovered... How about a hug for old times' sake?
Kay:
Nope. We need to focus on the trial right now!
Ray:
Yeah. Things aren't looking good.
The trial
Ray:
At any rate, we'll have to search for the evidence. But, we can't interrupt the trial... Hmm. Uncle Ray's in a pickle! In only there was someone who could find the evidence for us.
Edgeworth:
(...That look of expectation on your faces says it all.)
Edgeworth Law Offices
Ray:
Miles, you still don't have your prosecutor's badge, right? Do you finally feel like following in your father's footsteps?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I simply left it in someone else's care. I wasn't stripped of my badge. Furthermore... Right now, I am unable to follow in my father's footsteps.
Ray:
I see... Well, there's no need to rush your decision. Take all the time you need to determine the path you want to follow. In any case, the door's always open for you at the Edgeworth Law Offices!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields...
Present
Yatagarasu's Badge
Ray:
That's a lovely badge. You like it? I'm sure it would also look great on you, Miles.
Edgeworth:
This is Kay's treasure. I couldn't possibly wear it.
Ray:
Ah, I see! Righty-o-then! I guess there's no other choice. At this rate, the only thing left for you to wear is a defense attorney's badge!
Edgeworth:
Ngh...! (I fell right into his trap!)
Letter from Unknown or Grand Tower
Ray:
Getting Kay involved in an incident like that is inexcusable. Well, I guess the only good news is that my sweet little Kay got her memory back.
Kay:
My memory... I'm sorry. Somehow, I don't remember your name.
Ray:
Whaaat!? K-Kay... You sound serious. Don't tell me you've really forgotten about Uncle Ray!? Aww, how could you? Well then, how about a hug to cheer me up?
Kay:
Nope. Gotcha! Eheheh... It was just a joke, Mr. Shields! Thank you so much for everything you did for me when I lost my memories!
Ray:
Phew... Geez, gimme a break. Well then, how about a hug of relief?
Kay:
Nope.
Edgeworth:
(These two... have fallen back into their old routine.)
Anything else
Ray:
Ah, Ah-hah, this, eh. This evidence holds the so-called key to the case, right?
Edgeworth:
Err... It's possible.
Ray:
Yup. Then, hold on to it closely. Hurry, hurry, put it away!
Edgeworth:
(...He doesn't think much about this.)
Simon Keyes
Simon:
Isn't there anything we can do?
Kay:
Hmm, well... Actually, I just got a great idea! If we put on an animal show inside the courtroom, everyone would be caught up in it... ...and then, maybe they'd have to delay the trial another day?
Simon:
Nowaynowaynoway! If we did something like that, I'd get arrested for sure!
Kay:
Nah, you'll be fine! The court's not so cold as to arrest someone for showing everyone a good time! ...Right, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
(I would prefer if you didn't flagrantly encourage such criminal behavior...)
Regina Berry
Regina:
The courthouse is so much fun! There's even a wild animal tamer here!
Edgeworth:
(...A wild animal tamer?)
Regina:
Her showmanship could use some work... ...but that lady really knows how to handle a whip!
Edgeworth:
(Although, in her case, her whip is used to tame humans...)
Sofa
Edgeworth:
It's an old whole-leather sofa.
Kay:
Yeah! The leather's full of holes!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It's a whole-leather sofa, after all. (........I feel like there was a contradiction somewhere in this conversation.)
Bailiff or door on right
Bailiff:
During the recess, no one may enter the courtroom.
Kay:
Really, no one can get in?
Bailiff:
Like I said, during the recess, no one may enter the courtroom!
Kay:
But if nobody can go in, no one can resume the trial and we'll be stuck in recess forever.
Bailiff:
...Nnghhoooh! Y-You're right! We're all dooooooomed!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Did you like how I pointed out that contradiction just now?
Edgeworth:
(I don't think you'll gain any useful information by pressing the bailiff.)
Books
Kay:
"Compendium of Laws for Beginners", huh. I wonder if even I could read them? ...Ah! But it looks like Volume 1 is currently out on loan. I'd better wait and start with the first volume. Otherwise, the story won't make any sense!
Edgeworth:
Kay. I hate to ruin it for you, but law looks don't have any story to them...
(Clearing all "Talk" options of Franziska and Ray leads to:)
Ray:
If only there were someone who could go search for the evidence for us... ........
Edgeworth:
........ .....Very well. I'll go look for them.
Ray:
Oh! Miles! You'd do that for us?
Edgeworth:
Of course, finding the evidence within fifteen minutes will be no easy task.
Ray:
Well, if worse comes to worst, Uncle Ray and Franny-pie will help you stall for time.
Franziska:
..........
Ray:
Until you recover the evidence, we won't let her hand down a verdict.
Edgeworth:
Please do so. ...Franziska, are you OK with this?
Franziska:
.....You're asking me, Franziska von Karma, to help you out? You'd be better off spending the rest of your life as an anchorman for the local news...
Ray:
Ms. von Karma. This is an emergency. We could really use your cooperation.
Franziska:
! Hmph... I understand. As acting prosecutor, I, along with that attorney over there, shall continue this trial. Meanwhile, you, the "former" prosecutor shall run around and look for the evidence... ...all for my sake. It's a job that suits you perfectly!
Edgeworth:
...I'm glad that you're on board.
Simon:
I-I'll help out too! ...'Cause I really don't wanna get arrested again.
Regina:
This sounds like fun! Regina wants to tag along too!
Edgeworth:
Alright. That would be helpful. Now then, where should we begin?
Kay:
I think we should go find that person, and hear what they have to say!
Edgeworth:
Who should we talk to in order to learn where the evidence went?
Present Sebastian Debeste profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Yes. The person in charge of the evidence was Sebastian Debeste."
Present anyone else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Kay:
Huh!? That person knows where the evidence is?
Edgeworth:
Yes. I believe they should.
Kay:
Hmm... I don't think they have any connection with it.
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (So it wasn't this person.)
Kay:
If it's the evidence you're after, we should ask the person who was in charge of it!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. There's only one person that could be.
Leads back to:
"Who should we talk to in order to learn where the evidence went?"
Edgeworth:
Yes. The person in charge of the evidence was Sebastian Debeste.
Simon:
Ah, you mean that rookie prosecutor, right? Got it!
Edgeworth:
I'll leave him to you.
Ray:
Alright. Time for Uncle Ray to have a strategy meeting with the opposing counsel. ...Just the two of uUUAAAGH!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth... You better not keep me waiting. Lest you end up like your friend here.
Edgeworth:
Yes.... I'll keep that in mind.
Ray:
Franny-pie, wait for meeeee!
Edgeworth:
Now then, let's go help look for Sebastian as well.
Kay:
Ah!
Edgeworth:
(Judge Courtney...)
Courtney:
...If it isn't Prosecutor Edgeworth. I hope that all is well.
Kay:
All is NOT well! Just what was going on in that trial earlier...?
Edgeworth:
Kay! There's no need for that.
Kay:
But...! Even though Ms. Courtney should know exactly who the culprit is... What made you...?
Courtney:
........ In a court of law, the only thing that truly matters is evidence... Whatever my own feelings may be, it should not affect the verdict.
Edgeworth:
So, is this the "Judge persona" of Justine Courtney we're seeing?
Courtney:
Cold-blooded and heartless... It's fine if you think of me as such.
Edgeworth:
(Even as a judge, she's still this stubborn?) Judge Courtney. There's just... one thing I'd like to ask you.
Courtney:
And what would that be?
Edgeworth:
Two nights ago... you went to the roof of the Grand Tower.
Courtney:
! The roof... you say?
Edgeworth:
You met with the president there, correct? The two of you were caught on the security camera.
Courtney:
Is there some sort of problem with that?
Edgeworth:
Today... The president's body was discovered. Very close to the Grand Tower.
Courtney:
Th-That's...!
Edgeworth:
You understand now, don't you? You're a suspect. ...What happened between you and the president up on the roof?
Courtney:
Nothing... We merely spoke for a few minutes. Once our business was done, I headed straight home. I took the elevator back down alone.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. That was shown on the security camera footage as well. What exactly did you and the president talk about?
Courtney:
Th-That... I cannot say.
Edgeworth:
(I see. However, I cannot afford to let up just yet. That being the case... Heh. I guess my only remaining options is to use that. She is definitely hiding something...! And I'm going to draw it out of her!)
Edgeworth:
Two nights ago, Judge Courtney met with President Huang...
Courtney:
........
4 CHESS PIECES
Courtney:
...It is true that I spoke with President Huang on the roof of the Grand Tower. However, we only discussed business. There is no need to tell you what was said.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Just like in the trial earlier, she won't reveal her personal feelings easily. When she's speaking as a judge, it would be better for me to wait and see what develops. Now then, I'll start by asking her what she talked about with the president!
Begin Logic Chess
What did you and the president talk about?
Leads to:
"Could you tell me... what you and the president talked about?"
Edgeworth:
Could you tell me... what you and the president talked about?
Courtney:
My meeting with the president was strictly business. And since it has nothing to do with you, I am not obligated to answer your question.
I'm an acquaintance of the president's!
Edgeworth:
I will expose all of your lies for what they are.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.
Edgeworth:
(Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Leads to:
"......"
Edgeworth:
......
Courtney:
I appreciate your understanding.
Edgeworth:
Even so... You certainly are a very busy person, aren't you? You're a member of the P.I.C. and a judge as well. You even assist with the investigations.
Courtney:
I am simply fulfilling the professional duties that have been assigned to me.
Edgeworth:
Was your meeting with the president also one of the duties assigned to you as a judge?
Courtney:
.....Yes. Of course it was. I... am one who lives for the law. I would never act outside my professional duties.
Didn't you help me out this morning?
Leads to:
"This morning, you returned Kay's "promise notebook" to me."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
........
Courtney:
...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.
Edgeworth:
H... Hold on, please! (It seems I waited a little too long...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
This morning, you returned Kay's "promise notebook" to me. I don't believe that all of yours actions are simply done for the sake of your duties.
1 PIECE BROKEN
Courtney:
.....It's true, it seems I still retain some immature qualities.
Edgeworth:
I wouldn't call it immature. It was your own personal kindness. Weren't you also distressed when you found out the president had passed away?
Courtney:
Yes... It is very unfortunate... Why did he have to die...?
Edgeworth:
It seems he was crushed by the head of a monster called the "Mighty Moozilla". Ah... Excuse me. You see, Moozilla is...
Courtney:
I-Is that true!? You mean... the president died at the temporary Moozilla film lot...?
Edgeworth:
Yes. That's right... I'm surprised that you know about Moozilla.
Courtney:
Y-Yes... I had heard about it from Sebastian. He told me that the movie was being filmed near the Grand Tower...
Edgeworth:
...She seems awfully shaken up about that. And I'm also curious about Sebastian, who went missing along with the evidence. She said she wouldn't talk about the president... However, I might be able to get her to reveal her secret through another line of questioning. She is flustered beyond normal. There must be some reason behind it!
Where is Prosecutor Debeste?
Leads to:
"Franziska may have taken over the prosecution in Sebastian's place, however..."
Edgeworth:
Franziska may have taken over the prosecution in Sebastian's place, however... ...as long as he still possesses some of the evidence, the trial cannot proceed.
Courtney:
I intend to carry out a fair trial. If the prosecution is unable to present evidence... the defendant must be declared not guilty.
You and the defendant are both guilty!
Edgeworth:
I will expose all of your lies for what they are.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.
Edgeworth:
(Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!

Edgeworth:

Courtney:
I am a judge. I cannot allow my own personal feelings to get in the way.
Edgeworth:
So, you're saying you're not the least bit worried about Sebastian's whereabouts?
Courtney:
Of course... I am... I am worried about Sebastian, as well, but...
Didn't you help me out this morning?
Leads to:
"You're worried about Sebastian "as well"? Wouldn't that mean..."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:

Courtney:
...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.
Edgeworth:
H... Hold on, please! (It seems I waited a little too long...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
You're worried about Sebastian "as well"? Wouldn't that mean... ...that there is someone else you're worried about?
Courtney:
Ah...!
Edgeworth:
By any chance... would that person have something to do with your unnatural behavior?
Courtney:
...That's impossible. I... ...I am a follower of the law... I will not... be swayed by... personal feelings.
As a judge, you're only human!
Leads to:
"It may be true that those who stand in court have a duty to follow the law."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
It may be true that those who stand in court have a duty to follow the law. However, we're not superheroes! You and I are only human. It is impossible to completely ignore your own feelings and render an impartial judgement!
1 PIECE BROKEN
Courtney:
Aaaaaaah! .....It is as you say. As I am now... I cannot hand down an impartial verdict.
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Why don't you tell me the truth?
Courtney:
I... I...! Just what am I supposed to do...!?
Edgeworth:
For Judge Courtney to become this distraught... I should find out exactly who she is searching for. Up until now, she has been wearing the mask of a judge... This time, I should be able to draw out her true feelings!
Who are you searching for?
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Tell me who you are searching for.
Courtney:
...My lips are sealed. That is not something I can talk about right now.
Before obtaining clue from "Are you searching for Prosecutor Debeste?"
Edgeworth:
........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
After obtaining clue from "Are you searching for Prosecutor Debeste?"
Leads to:
"Let me try using that clue..."
Edgeworth:
Let me try using that clue...
Could it be that missing child?
Leads to:
""That child"... Could you tell me who you are referring to?"
Wait and see.

Edgeworth:
Could it be you're searching for that child who has gone missing?
Courtney:
Aaaah...!
Edgeworth:
Since you said it was a "child", I presume they're of a young age, correct?
Courtney:
I simply cannot answer any questions about him...That boy has nothing to do with you, or the president's assassination...

Edgeworth:
Is the person you're searching for... Sebastian, by any chance?
Courtney:
When Sebastian learned of his father's true colors, he went into hiding of his own free will. I am worried about him... but this may be a trial he needs to overcome on his own.
How heartless of you.
Edgeworth:
I will expose all of your lies for what they are.

Courtney:
In regards to that, my lips are sealed... I am unable to talk about it right now... When I think about what might happen to that child if I talked...
You consider Sebastian a "child"?

Leads back to first
Are you searching for Prosecutor Debeste? (after clearing this option)
Edgeworth:
I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
Are you searching for Moozilla?
Edgeworth:
Are you searching for... the Mighty Moozilla?
Courtney:
...I don't have the time to play along with your jokes right now.
Edgeworth:
It's not a joke! Just a moment ago... ...you were surprised to learn that the president had been crushed by Moozilla, correct?
Courtney:
Th-That was... I was simply surprised by the president's cause of death! To think that he passed away at the temporary film lot, of all places...
What's wrong with how he died?
Edgeworth:
I will expose all of your lies for what they are.

Th-That's not true. It's just... For the president to have passed away at a film lot, a place where dreams are made... I just thought it would be better if the movie's cast and crew... remained unaware of the truth.
A staff member found the body.
Leads to:
"I'm very sorry to say this..."
So it won't affect the box office?

Edgeworth:
Let me try using that clue...
Is he involved in the Moozilla movie?
Leads to:
"Earlier, when Moozilla was brought up, it seemed to be a sensitive topic for you..."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
........
Courtney:
...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.
Edgeworth:
H... Hold on, please! (It seems I waited a little too long...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Earlier, when Moozilla was brought up, it seemed to be a sensitive topic for you... Is that "child" you spoke of involved with the Moozilla movie?
1 PIECE BROKEN
Courtney:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! H-How!? How do you know that...!?
Edgeworth:
You're usually so calm, yet you seem rather distraught right now. Please, tell me... Who is that child!?
Courtney:
...I understand. If you've come to know this much... I shall prepare myself for the worst. The child I'm searching for... is a boy by the name of John Marsh.
Edgeworth:
John...? Why do you want to know his whereabouts?
Courtney:
Well... That much, I simply cannot say...
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Didn't you say you were prepared for the worst!?
Courtney:
.....!
Edgeworth:
Even if you don't intend to talk, I am determined to expose the truth. ...That is my resolve. Why is she searching for John... I must get her to tell me the reason.
Are you acquainted with him?
Edgeworth:
Are you acquainted with John, by any chance?
Courtney:
He is... a famous movie star. I doubt there is anyone who doesn't know who he is.
Edgeworth:
...I actually hadn't heard of him until I met with him today.
Courtney:
That... just proves you have much to learn. Allow me to give you a lesson. I know everything about him!
Then, what's his favorite food?
Edgeworth:
I will expose all of your lies for what they are.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.
Edgeworth:
(Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
I couldn't care less.
Edgeworth:
I will expose all of your lies for what they are.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.
Edgeworth:
(Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Leads to:
"......"
Edgeworth:
......
Courtney:
...My apologies. I seem to have lost my composure.
Edgeworth:
You tend to lose your calm whenever the conversation turns to John, don't you?
Courtney:
Uh...! I-In any case... While I may know everything about John, it is a one-sided relationship.
Before obtaining clue
Edgeworth:
........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
After obtaining clue
Leads to:
"Let me try using that clue..."
Edgeworth:
Let me try using that clue...
You must have spoken with John!
Leads to:
"It almost sounds as if John himself told you personally."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
........
Courtney:
...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.
Edgeworth:
H... Hold on, please! (It seems I waited a little too long...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
I understand you're worried about him, but aren't you a bit too flustered? You told me earlier that you had spoken with John. Doesn't that prove that you are indeed acquainted with him!?
Courtney:
Ah... Aaaaah! How could I have committed such an indiscretion...!?
Edgeworth:
It appears that John and Judge Courtney are acquaintances... This could be a vital clue.
Leads back to first
Are you acquainted with him? (after clearing this option)
Edgeworth:
I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
Where is he right now?
Edgeworth:
Actually, we are searching for John as well. Would you happen to have any idea where he might be?
Courtney:
...Why would you think that I would know where he is? John and I... There is no connection between us.
Before obtaining clue
Edgeworth:
........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
After obtaining clue
Leads to:
"Let me try using that clue..."
Are you a fan of his?
Edgeworth:
Could it be that... you're a fan of John Marsh?
Courtney:
.....Yes. Yes... That's right! I am... a fan of John Marsh, the famous child actor who has been called a prodigy!
I don't think he is a prodigy...
Edgeworth:
I will expose all of your lies for what they are.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.
Edgeworth:
(Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!

That's an unexpected interest.
Edgeworth:

Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Leads to:
"......"
Edgeworth:
......
Courtney:
I knew his movie was being filmed in front of the Grand Tower... ...so the temporary film lot had been on my mind.
Edgeworth:
...I see. I suppose a fan would be curious about that. Did you know that John was at the temporary film lot?
Courtney:
Yes... Of course I did. He said they would be filming there all day today, and yet...!
Did you hear that from him?
Leads to:
"It almost sounds as if John himself told you personally."
You sound like a stalker.
Edgeworth:
I will expose all of your lies for what they are.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.

Edgeworth:

Courtney:
Ah...!
Edgeworth:
I doubt he would give his schedule to a mere fan!
Courtney:
That's... true, isn't it? Please don't pay any mind to that statement...
Edgeworth:
She made another slip of the tongue... She must be really worried about John. So, she has spoken with John... This could be a useful clue.
Leads back to first
Are you a fan of his? (after clearing this option)
Edgeworth:
I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.

You two must be acquainted!

Edgeworth:
I don't know what kind of relationship you have with John... ...but at the very least, the two of you must be acquaintances!
Courtney:
E... Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Won't you allow us to help you in your search for him?
Courtney:
Help...? No, that won't be allowed?
Edgeworth:
Who won't allow it? The so-called Goddess of Law?
Courtney:
...The person who knows where that child is..
A paparazzi?
Edgeworth:
I will expose all of your lies for what they are.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.

Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
I see... Finally, I've connected all the pieces of the puzzle. The reason why you cannot easily talk about John... It was because... Someone kidnapped him, isn't that right?
Courtney:
A-Aah... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Edgeworth:
...Judge Courtney. I would like to hear the truth from your own lips.
Courtney:
.....I understand. This time... I will truly be prepared for the worst. It is just as you deduced... Someone has kidnapped John.
Edgeworth:
! As I thought... There was a kidnapping! Still, how is John's kidnapping related to you in any way?
Courtney:
......John and I are... ...mother and child...
Edgeworth:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? I was unable to learn much about the conversation she had with the president, but... ...I have learned of John's kidnapping. ...It was an unexpected result, but with that... it's checkmate.
Logic Chess Complete
Courtney:
.......
Kay:
Whaaat!? J-John is... Ms. Courtney's son!? No way! I mean, he's already so big, for him to be your...
Courtney:
Yes... John is indeed my son. Please look at this...
Edgeworth:
(This is a clipping from a magazine...)
Kay:
It's an article about John! Do you always carry this around with you?
Courtney:
Yes. I always keep it close by. It's like a charm to me...
Edgeworth:
(It seems the bond that they share is a strong one.)
Courtney:
.......
Edgeworth:
However, are you absolutely certain that he's been kidnapped?
Courtney:
Yes. I received a call from the kidnapper just before the trial started...
Edgeworth:
What were their demands?
Courtney:
They had only one demand. A "Not Guilty" verdict for Patricia Roland...
Edgeworth:
(I see. So that's what happened...)
Roland:
And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... "In court, evidence is everything." Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor?
Courtney:
.......... That is correct. The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Patricia Roland...
Edgeworth:
So, that's why you were going to deliver a "Not Guilty" verdict earlier?
Courtney:
I am... not qualified to be a judge... A judge must be able to remain impartial and composed, above all else. And yet... despite this, in the trial just now, I... ...I was about to hand down a verdict that was led solely by my heart!
Edgeworth:
.....Judge Courtney.
Courtney:
The Goddess of Law must be furious with me... ...but, I simply couldn't do it. I couldn't hand down a fair verdict... if it meant I had to sacrifice my own son!
Objection!
Kay:
Of course you can't!
Edgeworth:
(Kay...)
Kay:
A real parent... would never abandon their own child! If that makes the Goddess of Law angry, then maybe the Goddess is the one who's wrong! The Goddess is guilty! Guilty! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. (To declare a goddess guilty...) We're responsible for upholding the law, but at the same time, we are only human. Nobody would hand down a verdict that would sacrifice their own child.
Courtney:
.....Thank you very much. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth. However... I cannot simply run away from the courtroom.
Bailiff:
Judge Courtney! So this is where you've been.
Courtney:
It appears it's time...
Kay:
.......... Ms. Courtney! ...My father, he was a prosecutor.
Courtney:
Your father...?
Kay:
Yes. He stood in court, just like you. ...And now, with all that has happened, it got me thinking... What if, my father had been in the same position as you are now?
Courtney:
If a prosecutor was being coerced into obtaining a guilty verdict...
Kay:
I know... if my life were on the line, my father... ...would definitely come to steal me back!
Courtney:
Steal you... back?
Kay:
Ms. Courtney. Why don't you let us take care of it?
Courtney:
What...?
Kay:
I'm gonna go steal John back for you! As the second Yatagarasu, I, Kay Faraday, give you my word!
Courtney:
......
Edgeworth:
(Heh. So, the Great Thief Yatagarasu plans to steal the "truth", huh...) What say you, Judge Courtney? Will you place your trust in our young Great Thief?
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
And, if it's alright with you, I wish to help as well.
Courtney:
.....Thank you very much. I know that it's really not my place to ask this of you... ...but please... do whatever you can... Please save John.
Kay:
You got it! Just leave everything to us!
Courtney:
Allow me to leave my cellphone with you. You may get a call from the kidnapper at some point.
Edgeworth:
You have my word. I will ensure the safe return of your phone, alone with your son.
Courtney:
And I will do everything in my power to prolong the trial. But... even then, at most the trial can only last for about two more hours...
Edgeworth:
(Two hours, huh... So, until 2 PM. That's our time frame...)
Courtney:
...I must return to court. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall leave the rest to you.
Edgeworth:
Heh. Kay, I thought you were taking a break from being the Great Thief?
Kay:
As of right now, the Great Thief Yatagarasu is back in business! Alright! Time to put on the gloves and hit the pavement! It's my first request, after all!
Edgeworth:
Is that so? In that case, we'd better begin our investigation posthaste... ...if we hope to track down John...
Lang:
Tch! Where'd he run off to!?
Edgeworth:
He might have just gone back home.
Kay:
That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today!
Lang:
...Or he may have run away.
Edgeworth:
We should probably begin our investigation from the front of the Grand Tower.
Kay:
H-Hey! Hold it, Mr. Edgeworth! You're not the one in charge anymore! From here on out, this is a job for a Great Thief! Which means, I'm the leader now!
Edgeworth:
...If that's the case, then what am I supposed to do?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, you get to be... the first ever Great Thief's Assistant!
Edgeworth:
(So, I'm a thief's assistant now...?)
Kay:
Alright! Let's get going! The Great Thief Yatagarasu takes flight once again!
April 6, 12:10 PMOutside Grand TowerTower Plaza
Kay:
Here we are! The scene of the crime! Let's get to work! Now, say it with me, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Hm? Say what?
Kay:
"Even in the depths of night..."
Edgeworth:
..........
Kay:
Aww, come on! Say the rest with me!
Edgeworth:
And just why should I do that!?
Kay:
Because! The Great Thief Yatagarasu has arrived on the scene! If we don't say the introduction, it just doesn't feel right!
Edgeworth:
I have no intention of becoming a thief.
Kay:
Aargh! Fine, then. I'll do it by myself! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu!
Edgeworth:
Yes, Kay. I know you are. I, on the other hand, am starting the investigation.
Kay:
Tch. You're no fun.
Edgeworth:
...We don't have time for "fun". We only have until 2 o'clock. We need to begin making inquiries immediately.
Kay:
Good thing we have a photo, so we can go right ahead and start asking around!
Begin Investigation
Outside Grand TowerTower Plaza
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Notice anything?
Kay:
To think that Ms. Courtney is actually a kind and doting mother to her son... I never would have guessed it from how she normally acts.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. In order to fulfill her role as a judge... ...she had to conceal her true feelings behind that facade.
Kay:
Although John is a bit of a brat... ...I can't bear to see Ms. Courtney looking so sad! We definitely have to steal John back for Ms. Courtney's sake!
The kidnapping
Edgeworth:
To think that John had been kidnapped and was being held hostage all this time...
Kay:
That explains why we weren't be able to find him anywhere.
Edgeworth:
The last time we saw him was at the film set. We should start by gathering information over there.
Kay:
The kidnappers may have left some clues behind! Let's examine everything, even if it seems totally unrelated!
Trailer
Edgeworth:
This trailer is used to shuttle actors to and from the film lot.
Kay:
It shuttles the actors? Does that mean... Galactic Trailer, ready for launch! Three... two... one... Ignition! Blast off at the speed of light! Shower thrusters on full! Rocket bathroom engage!
Edgeworth:
(I would prefer a calm relaxing bath myself...)
Kay:
The kidnappers may have left some clues behind! Let's examine everything, even if it seems totally unrelated!
Trailer (after clearing all "Talk" options of orange man)
Edgeworth:
About John's seat...
Powers:
Ah, it's over there, where that backpack is sitting.
Edgeworth:
(Hm? Something is sticking out of the bag.) This is... a tape?
Powers:
Huh? It's a tape for filming. Why does John have one?
Edgeworth:
(Did he film something? This might be a clue.) Is there any way to check its contents?
Powers:
We have a monitor to look over the footage that was filmed. We can use that. Now then, let's see what's on the tape.
Edgeworth:
This is...! It looks like when John was practicing.
Penny:
John was practicing by himself...
Edgeworth:
(The monster's footprints can be seen as well... so this must have been recorded last night.)
Powers:
He does that sometimes... When he's not happy with his performance, he'll sneak onto the set to practice by himself.
Kay:
Wow. He really IS hard working!
Powers:
He sure is. Although he's young, he's a real pro. He never rests until he's satisfied. Then again... I can't say that I approve of him using the equipment without asking.
Edgeworth:
John is able to operate the equipment all by himself?
Powers:
More or less, if it's just basic filming...
Kay:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
What's wrong? Why isn't John on the screen anymore...?
Kay:
I think he ran off somewhere just a few seconds before this.
Edgeworth:
(Did he go somewhere while the camera was still recording?) The tape ends here... It looks like this was all that was recorded.
Kay:
No one else was on camera except for John.
John's Practice Video data jotted down in my Organizer.
Film equipment (after clearing all "Talk" options of orange man)
Edgeworth:
(Pieces of film equipment have been placed here.) Are you filming today?
Powers:
No. We had to stop filming for today... ...since a box has disappeared.
Edgeworth:
A box...? (What is he talking about?)
Powers:
Yeah. There was some equipment in that box. I take my eyes off of it for a few seconds, and look what happens...
Kay:
So, there's a thief among us!?
Edgeworth:
Exactly what was stolen?
Powers:
Nothing much, actually. Just the box (Stolen box - Went missing from the trailer. Only the box itself was stolen.) is missing.
Kay:
Why would someone steal a box...? Personally, I would have taken the stuff inside.
Edgeworth:
They probably wanted the box more than whatever was inside it. (Did they plan to put something inside the box?)
Orange man
???:
Long time no see, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Y-You're...!
Edgeworth:
This is Will Powers. He is an action star I met in a previous case. He also played the role of the Steel Samurai, Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.
Edgeworth:
It's been a long time.
Kay:
Pleased to meet you! I'm Kay Faraday, a Great Thief. Some stuff has happened, so now Mr. Edgeworth is my assistant!
Powers:
Nice to meet you... but, a thief? And Mr. Edgeworth is your assistant?
Edgeworth:
Please, pay it no heed. More importantly, I'd like to ask you some questions about the case.
Powers:
O-OK... I don't know if I'll be much help though.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. He's an actor who has been working with John... It may be a bit sudden, but let's hear what he has to say.)
About the case
Powers:
I had heard that you were handling the investigation for this case, but...
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Well, that's... (I'm not the prosecutor in charge though...)
Powers:
But if you're the assistant, then does this mean that Kay is in charge?
Edgeworth:
No, this is just a simple mis...
Kay:
You've got a good eye on you! You're completely right!
Edgeworth:
(She jumped at the chance...)
Kay:
Since I'm in charge here, I'd like you to answer a few questions posthaste. And please be frank... Did anything happen to catch your eye... Ergo, didn't you notice anything?
Edgeworth:
(Who is she trying to imitate?)
Powers:
Be frank, huh? Well... I feel sorry for the victim, but... ...I can't help but worry about what will happen with the filming from now on...
Edgeworth:
No, that's only natural. Still, I would think that filming would be difficult now.
Powers:
I knew it... This is bad. We can only use this location for a little while longer, too.
Edgeworth:
Is the filming almost complete, then?
Powers:
No, but construction will begin here soon, so we won't be able to film here anymore. We're only using this vacant lot until construction begins.
Edgeworth:
(So the rest of the movie will be filmed at Global Studios...)
Powers:
Things aren't looking good. There's even some people spreading bad rumors...
Edgeworth:
Bad rumors?
Powers:
Lately, a "journalist" has been coming by repeatedly, saying... "This film lot's hidin' a real monster, I reckon! There ain't no use hidin' it!" ...and stuff like that.
Edgeworth:
I have a feeling I know who you're talking about...
Powers:
Yes. It was that photographer from before.
Kay:
You're not actually hiding a real monster, are you?
Powers:
Of course not! If there really was one, I'd be out of a job...
Monster movie
Edgeworth:
It seems they're putting a lot of work into this movie.
Powers:
That's because this is our first attempt at making a sequel to an old classic. Global Studios is pouring their heart and soul into this one.
Edgeworth:
(I wish they'd put that much effort into making a new Steel Samurai series.) What role are you playing this time, Mr. Powers?
Powers:
I'm playing the Mighty Moozilla.
Kay:
Wow! You're the main character!
Powers:
Well... M-Much obliged... I'm wearing a full-body costume again, so my face won't be seen this time either...
Kay:
I see. That costume sure is cool though. I wanna try wearing it too! I know. How about next time, you let me get in the costume? Maybe just the horn part?
Powers:
That's... not really possible. You can't get inside the horns.
Kay:
Well... I guess that makes sense. I'm not in the screen actors guild after all...
Edgeworth:
(I don't think that's what he means.)
John Marsh (appears after "About the case" and "Monster movie")
Edgeworth:
I would like to ask you some questions about John...
Powers:
About John? Ah, I heard about it from the girl on staff. How he suddenly vanished from right in front of you guys... That's just like him.
Kay:
Does he do that a lot?
Powers:
I'd say so. During filming breaks, if you even took your eyes off of him for a moment, he'd be gone.
Edgeworth:
Do you have any idea as to where he might have gone?
Powers:
I don't know, but... ...I ran into him as he was leaving the film lot.
Kay:
What!? Really? Where did John go?
Powers:
I saw him get in the trailer, but... ...when I was checking the equipment, he was gone again.
Edgeworth:
(The trailer... huh. There might still be some traces of him left behind.) Mr. Powers. Could you show us the trailer?
Powers:
Sure thing. It's a bit of a mess right now, though.
Edgeworth:
(Let's take him up on his offer and examine the inside of the trailer.)
Present
Monster Movie Flyer
Powers:
Ah, that flyer... I thought about giving one to you, but it seems you already have one.
Edgeworth:
Yes. However, a fictitious monster battling against a fake Gourdy is... How should I put it... It's a little farfetched.
Powers:
Actually, I think so too. But, in the beginning, we tried to find the real Gourdy from Gourd Lake... There were plans to use footage of the real monster in the film.
Edgeworth:
(It seems the problems with this movie stem from before they even started filming...)
Moozilla's Head or Monster's Footprints
Powers:
Ahh... So, Moozilla's head is broken, and giant footprints were left at the set. Actually, quite a lot of money was spent on production costs... You could say that the fate of Global Studios rests entirely on the film's success. I'm sorry... for talking about such things when someone has just died.
Edgeworth:
No, there's no need to worry. It is an undeniable fact that the film lot has been severely damaged.
Kay:
Global Studios also makes the Steel Samurai, right? ...Mr. Edgeworth. This is bad! If we don't resolve this case quickly, the Steel Samurai might also be gone for good!
Edgeworth:
(Ugh...! I never thought I'd be under so much pressure...)
Moozilla Doll
Powers:
That's the original Moozilla. It was pretty popular over a decade ago. This is the type that can record your voice, right?
Edgeworth:
(Yes. We were saved not too long ago, thanks to its recording function.)
Powers:
But this doll has one horn on it.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... What do you mean?
Powers:
There should be a total of two horns attached, one on each side. But if it's from over ten years ago, I guess it's not surprising that it's missing a horn.
Edgeworth:
I-Is that so? I thought the doll had a nice design, even with the missing horn...
Kay:
But you're always so nit-picky when it comes to the design of the Steel Samurai.
Edgeworth:
(Hmph... She doesn't understand at all. That hero is special.)
Commemorative Photo or John's Practice Video
Powers:
What can I say...? It gives you a good sense of the film lot, doesn't it? The entire cast and crew are all pumped up for this work, even more than usual. Despite all the hardships... we're never without a smile. It's a really nice atmosphere. And now... this happened...
Edgeworth:
(Although there is nothing I can do about the interruption of the filming... If I solve this case, they might be able to resume filming. In that case, there's only one thing for us to do...!)
Anything else
Powers:
Wh... What's this supposed to be? I might be able to help you if it has something to do with acting or stunts, but...
Edgeworth:
I appreciate that. However, this has nothing to do with acting or stunts...
Powers:
Is that so...? That's too bad.
Edgeworth:
(He seems disappointed.)
Sign
Edgeworth:
It appears to be a map of the area around the Grand Tower. Let's take a look.
Dust Waste Management
Kay:
Dust Waste Management... Do they help you manage your wasteful spending?
Edgeworth:
No, this is where the garbage trucks bring all the combustible waste they've collected. ...By the way, Kay, why are you so fidgety?
Kay:
It's nothing. More importantly, there's another waste center on the top right corner of the map!
Edgeworth:
Since they're separate facilities, they probably handle different kinds of waste. Although, there does seem to be a lot of waste management facilities around here.
Kay:
Oh... Ooh! I think I know why. I bet they're always collecting garbage from dusk till dawn.
Edgeworth:
(Were you so fidgety because you were waiting for a chance to say that...?)
Grand Tower
Edgeworth:
This is the Grand Tower. It's where we are right now.
Kay:
It's a nice building, but... I can't say I'm a fan.
Edgeworth:
(I can't blame her. It wouldn't be strange if she never wanted to set foot in the tower again.)
Kay:
But Mr. Edgeworth, once we discover the truth and completely solve this case... ...can we come here again, just to sightsee? And we can bring Gummy along with us too!
Edgeworth:
(Never letting the past hold you back... and always looking forward. That's just like you.) Unfortunately, Kay, we aren't quite finished here yet. There's still much left to solve. It's too early to be making plans for the future.
Kay:
Hmm... I guess so. Well then, let's hurry up and solve it!
Rising Sun Park
Kay:
I never really cared much for that sort of thing... I heard that ultraviolet rays from the sun can cause burn marks on your skin.
Edgeworth:
...Kay, what in the world are you talking about?
Kay:
C'mon! I'm talking about the Rising Sun Park, of course!
Edgeworth:
(I'd like to bask in that sentiment... while I watch the sun rise in the park.)
Sunshine Coliseum
Edgeworth:
The Sunshine Coliseum. It's a place where all sorts of special events are held.
Kay:
I've always wanted to go to the World Thief Expo, but it was cancelled this year. I heard that it's a huge event, where all the greatest thieves from around the world gather. But last year, everyone who went got arrested! Turns out it was just a trap set up by the police to catch the thieves.
Edgeworth:
(And even knowing that... you still want to go?)
Dawn Waste Center or Sunshine Harbor
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It seems the harbor and the waste center are quite close to each other.
Kay:
Maybe that's where they dispose of all the garbage that comes floating in from the ocean?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps they do... but I'm sure they also deal with other types of waste as well.
Kay:
Other types of waste... Ah! You don't mean shells and fish bones, do you? You can't just throw away the fish and shells you catch from the sea like garbage! You oughta recycle them! Make 'em into jewelry and stuff!
Edgeworth:
...Kay. Lets's talk about this matter some other time.
Blue truck
Kay:
Hey, Jooooohn! Hmm. Guess he's not here. This basket looked pretty suspicious to me, but...
Edgeworth:
(It certainly does...) ........
Kay:
Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck?
Edgeworth:
The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time.
Kay:
You can figure all that out just by touching it!?
Edgeworth:
Considering the length of time it's been parked here, the driver must not be nearby. I suppose we won't be able to ask them any questions until they return.
Blue Truck data jotted down in my Organizer.
Taxi
Driver:
Hey buddy, what's wrong? Your face looks so serious!
Edgeworth:
Have you picked up any passengers here today?
Driver:
Oh! I sure did! But it was only one group.
Edgeworth:
What did they look like?
Driver:
It was a pair of men. They were both wearing black.
Edgeworth:
Did you happen to see a small boy with them?
Kay:
Here's a picture of him!
Driver:
Nope. It was just the two guys.
Edgeworth:
I understand. Thank you for your cooperation. (I was hoping he would have some more information for us... but I guess not.) (Two men - Wore black and rode in the taxi. Didn't appear to have a child with them.)
Officer
Officer:
Thank you for your hard work, Prosecutor Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(Hm? I'm not a prosecutor at the moment, but I'll keep quiet about that for now...) Thank you. What are you doing here?
Officer:
Sir! I'm on guard duty!
Edgeworth:
Then, could you tell me about the cars that have passed through here today?
Officer:
The only ones that came through here were that taxi and that blue truck!
Edgeworth:
(So, two different vehicles came through this place (Cars that came through - Only a taxi and a blue truck came through the plaza this morning.). This is valuable information.)
(Examining trailer after clearing all "Talk" options of Powers, blue truck, taxi, and film equipment and talking with officer leads to:)
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. It's already half past 12...)
Kay:
I wonder how Ms. Courtney and the others are holding up...
Edgeworth:
How long will they be able to prolong the trial...?
Kay:
We gotta hurry and find John!
Edgeworth:
Indeed.
Lotta:
Aww heck naw! That ain't how it's done! Ya ain't gonna catch a scoop like that!
Nicole:
S-Sorry, Chief!
Lotta:
What am I always tellin' ya!? We're beasts! Scoop-eatin' animals! It's scoop or starve! No story, no glory! Ya gotta get fired up!
Nicole:
Yessir! As expected of my mentor!
Edgeworth:
They're here... (It's those noisy reporters.)
Kay:
Hey, they came here too! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go talk to them!
Edgeworth:
...Good grief. If we must.
Logic
"Two men" and "Men in black"
Edgeworth:
We've now collected some testimony regarding the culprits. Ms. Swift says she saw two men slip away with John. Furthermore, the taxi driver says he picked up two men in his taxi.
Kay:
They must be the same guys!
Edgeworth:
It seems likely. However, there is still a problem. According to the taxi driver, the two men were alone. John wasn't with them (John wasn't with them - When the men who took John got in taxi, there were only two of them.).
Kay:
Yeah, you're right... That is a problem.
"Stolen box" and "John wasn't with them"
Leads to:
"What if the kidnappers stole the box?"
Lotta Hart
Nicole Swift
Edgeworth:
Did Ms. Swift call you her mentor just now?
Lotta:
She sure did! Nicole is my number one pupil! She says she fell in love with the photos from my scoops! Even if our jobs are different, our passion for scoops is the same, lemme tell ya! Ever since then, she's been all cute-like, callin' me stuff like "Master" and "Chief"!
Edgeworth:
(So she fell in love with Ms. Hart's photos... I guess you could say, "like teacher, like student.")
Lotta:
She's still got a ways to go in gatherin' information, but her passion's a match for mine. Seems like she was tryin' to catch the scoop about Moozilla's appearance... She's been circlin' 'round these parts all day long.
Kay:
Circling around this area... Maybe she witnessed the kidnapping! Mr. Edgeworth. Looks like we'll need to hear what she has to say.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. (We need more information about John. Let's show Ms. Swift that piece of evidence, and ask her about him.)
Your next scoop
Edgeworth:
Now that the black market auctions are over, what are you aiming for next?
Lotta:
Ain't it obvious!? The Mighty Moozilla! I'm goin' after Moozilla! Who'd've thunk that while I was stakin' out the black market auction at the Grand Tower... ...the Mighty Moozilla's footprints would show up right next to the tower!?
Edgeworth:
Is there really a place that would publish a story like that?
Lotta:
Don't treat me like a fool! I've got one or two valued clients lined up. Actually, there's a newspaper company here at the Grand Tower. Me and Nicole go there all the time. Well... We always get turned away at the door, but still...
Edgeworth:
(I wouldn't exactly call that a valued client.)
Present
Yatagarasu's Badge
Lotta:
Hey, you... the gal with the ponytail. Yeah, I'm talkin' to YOU!
Kay:
Huh? You mean me?
Lotta:
Why would ya pin somethin' like that to yer clothes?
Kay:
Well, umm, this is the badge of the Yatagarasu, and it's a Great Thief's...
Lotta:
That ain't what I'm askin'! Even if it's wrapped in gold paper, won't yer body heat melt it? Don't ya get what I'm talkin' 'bout!? The chocolate. That big ol' piece of o' chocolate! Didn't nobody teach ya not to play with yer food!?
Kay:
M... Mr. Edgewooorth. What am I supposed to do?
Edgeworth:
(Kay. At times like these, just stay silent and wait for the storm to pass.)
Letter from Unknown or Grand Tower
Lotta:
Well, I guess the case of the black market auction was resolved thanks to me.
Kay:
Yeah! We should probably thank you as well, shouldn't we? Thank you so much! I've fully recovered all of my memories too!
Lotta:
Huh... your memories? Wait, you lost your memories?
Edgeworth:
(It would seem that it is her memories that are suspect...)
Monster Movie Flyer, Moozilla's Head, Moozilla Doll or Monster's Footprints
Lotta:
Hey, heinous prosecutor! I'm tellin' ya now, the Mighty Moozilla is mine! I'm gonna go over this place with a fine-tooth comb and find me every last clue! I won't miss even a single strand of fallen hair, not to mention its footprints!
Edgeworth:
Fallen hair...? (You were searching for something like that?)
Kay:
M... Mr. Edgeworth, it's fine. You don't need to worry yet! Your father had a full head of hair, after all. Everyone's hair falls out a little bit at some point! Please have some more confidence!
Edgeworth:
(I wasn't worried about that... Why is she trying to cheer met up about it?)
Lotta's Testimony
Lotta:
Shucks. I may be a heck of a social photographer... ...but after spendin' all that time hunkered down behind that statue, my back is killin' me.
Edgeworth:
Now that you mention it, you said that you saw Moozilla from behind the statue, correct?
Lotta:
I sure did! If and when Moozilla's existence comes to light... ...think of the huge impact it'll have on society! Well? That's the kinda stuff we social photographers always have on our minds.
Kay:
I guess there'd be a pretty big impact on society if Gourdy was proven to exist as well.
Lotta:
You betcha. Same with ancient aliens, dragons, buried treasures, time machines, and spirit mediums! A social photographer's gotta cover everything that impacts society! Ain't it awesome?
Kay:
Wow! You gotta be concerned with everything! You really are a friend to society.
Edgeworth:
Kay. Please don't take her seriously.
Anything else
Lotta:
Lemme just say, if yer tryin' to grab my interest... ...ya gotta bring me something that actually smells like a scoop!
Edgeworth:
(...I guess this didn't catch her interest.)
Nicole Swift
Nicole:
If it ain't Mr. Edgeworth! So we meet again.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift. ...Why are you here?
Edgeworth:
You were set up as the suspect for the murder. Still, your involvement with the fake assassination plan remains a fact. You will have to submit to police questioning later. You should know that there's still a possibility you may be charged with some crime.
Nicole:
For some reason... my questionin' was stopped all of a sudden. After a while, they just let me out and told me I could go home scot-free. It must be some kinda message, sayin' I need to keep on doin' my best out there, I reckon. Well, they did give me a pretty stern warnin' not to reveal anythin' about the case.
Edgeworth:
(In the official statement released to the public about the assassination attempt... ...Ms. Swift was not involved. That must have been the reason why they let her go.)
Kay:
But, Mr. Edgeworth. Attempting to silence Nicole like this... ...is like trying to plug a leaky dam with your bare hands.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... (She was quick to say something to harsh.)
Nicole:
I quickly put together the full details of everything I knew about the case... ...sprinkled in some of my own dramatizations, and brought the article in to a publisher. But... for some reason, I haven't gotten any replies yet...
Edgeworth:
(Were they pressured to keep quiet, or were her dramatizations simply too much...? ...Both are probable, so I'm not sure which is true.)
Collecting information
Edgeworth:
What information were you trying to collect here at the Grand Tower?
Nicole:
Mr. Edgeworth. Ya still don't get it, do ya? If ya wanna ask a reporter a question, ya gotta give her somethin' first!
Edgeworth:
Do you mean information that can be used in an article...?
Nicole:
Bingo! Gimme some info that'll make for a good article! If ya ain't got somethin' like that, I guess we won't be talkin'.
Edgeworth:
(I also need some information about John... Let's show her that piece of evidence, and try asking her about him.)
Top secret material (after presenting Commemorative Photo)
Kay:
D-Do you know something about it?
Nicole:
Truth is... I done saw it myself. A boy bein' taken away by a couple of men in black (Men in black - Nicole witnessed John being taken away by some men in black.)...!
Kay:
What!? Where'd they go?
Nicole:
That, I don't know. They were too far away, so I lost sight of 'em...
Kay:
Darn it! But, at least we know what the criminals looked like!
Edgeworth:
Yes. (A pair of men in black...)
Present
Monster Movie Flyer, Grand Tower, Moozilla's Head, Moozilla Doll, Monster's Footprints or Lotta's Testimony
Nicole:
Infiltratin' a den of evil to cover a scoop, with complete disregard for her own life... My mentor is really the greatest! Don't ya agree, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
(She must be talking about Ms. Hart... Although I don't really want to comment...) Personally, I would prefer if she didn't make so many rash decisions.
Nicole:
Hmm. So in other words, she's good at makin' snap decisions. Is there anythin' else?
Edgeworth:
I'd also prefer if she'd gather information properly, instead of flattering people of status.
Nicole:
Hmm. So in other words, she's able to get lots of info from important people. That's just what I would expect from my mentor!
Edgeworth:
(I would also prefer if you didn't take everything I say and turn it all around...)
Commemorative Photo
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift. I'm sorry, but about this photo...
Nicole:
Ya ain't gotta say it! I know exactly what's goin' on!
Edgeworth:
Hm? What do you mean?
Nicole:
Yer searchin' for him, ain't ya? .....That boy.
Edgeworth:
What?
Nicole:
Things are still pretty tough for you, I see. Miles Edgeworth, the Man of Crime! Wherever he goes, dead bodies are sure to follow! ...Or somethin' like that.
Edgeworth:
(That's a terrible reputation to have.)
Nicole:
Who woulda thought... this time, there'd be a kidnappin' incident.
Edgeworth:
!
Kay:
What! H-How'd you know that?
Nicole:
Shh! Shh! ...Could ya keep it down a little? This material is top secret. I ain't even told my mentor about it yet. Y'all gotta keep it a secret for me. If she finds out, I'll be a goner!
Edgeworth:
Why do you know...? (Judge Courtney should have only told us...)
Nicole:
Hmhmhmm. I ain't tellin' that to anyone, not even you, Mr. Prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
(It seems this reporter still hasn't learned her lesson...)
Nicole:
Y-Ya can give me the stink eye all ya want! I still ain't tellin'!
Anything else
	
Nicole:
At that moment, the prosecutor presents his evidence! A faintly shinin'... shinin'... ...Umm. What'd ya just show me?
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Never mind. (Looks like she doesn't know anything about it.)
Edgeworth:
What if the kidnappers stole the box?
Kay:
Ah! You mean they...!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. They took it in order to carry John inside it.
Kay:
John's a tiny kid, after all. Then, the reason the taxi driver didn't see John was because...
Edgeworth:
It's likely he was put in the trunk as the kidnapper's luggage.
Kay:
But, why did they need to go through all the trouble of hiding him?
Edgeworth:
At first, the kidnappers must have intended to abduct him without being seen. However, they didn't anticipate all the policemen in the plaza.
Kay:
Ah, I see. If they tried to just walk away with him, they would've been spotted...
Edgeworth:
Just the mere presence of policemen would have been a sizable threat.
Kay:
I geddit! In that case, we've gotta ask the taxi driver!
Edgeworth:
Did the two men you told us about earlier have any luggage with them?
Driver:
Yeah. They stuffed a huge box into the trunk.
Kay:
Then that's that! Those guys must be the kidnappers!
Edgeworth:
Do you remember where you took those men?
Driver:
Sounds to me like something serious has gone down here... If you'd like, I could take you to the same place I took them.
Kay:
Let's do it, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Yes. Thank you for your help.
Driver:
No problemo! Just leave it to me!
Investigation Complete
April 6, 12:57 PM???????
Kay:
Uugh... That taxi drove way too fast. I don't feel too good.
Edgeworth:
........
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, are you alright? Your face is really pale.
Edgeworth:
I-I'm fine. The driver said they came to this house's garage...
Kay:
This must be where those two men brought the box! ...Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Look at the nameplate on the door!
Edgeworth:
Nameplate...? What!? "Blaise Debeste"!?
Kay:
So this is... the chairman's house!
Edgeworth:
(Does that mean the one who kidnapped John was Blaise Debeste? Blaise should have already been arrested though...)
Kay:
Ah! The garage door is unlocked!
Edgeworth:
You really do have a good eye for this sort of thing...
Edgeworth:
(It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.)
Kay:
Excuse me... we're coming in... Anybody home?
Edgeworth:
Doing something like this, it's as if we're a couple of petty thieves...!
Kay:
Shh! Be quiet! Right now, we're Great Thieves! Have some self-awareness!
Edgeworth:
(...She scolded me.) Nobody's here... For now, it looks like we can get through this without being arrested.
Kay:
This isn't the time to be relieved! Now the real deal begins! Let's go look for treasure!
Edgeworth:
(We are looking for John, not treasure...)
Green box
Edgeworth:
This large box... this must be it. This is probably the box that Mr. Powers said had been stolen.
Kay:
So John was stashed in this box and then transported all the way here.
Edgeworth:
Please don't talk about people as if they are objects. However, if that's the case... ...there is also a possibility that John is still somewhere in this garage.
Kay:
Ok, let's go look for him! Our honor as the Great Thief and her assistant depend on it!
Edgeworth:
(...Good grief.)
Gloves
Kay:
Ah! I found something good!
Edgeworth:
These are... mechanic's gloves. You wear them during vehicle maintenance, or when you're working with machinery.
Kay:
They look really stained with motor oil.
Edgeworth:
(However, they are also horribly stained with dirt... could the gloves have gotten this dirty just from maintaining the bike?)
Kay:
Mmm. I don't really like Blaise, but these gloves are pretty cool. Do you think we could come up with some reason to take these with us!?
Edgeworth:
(When you say it like that, it makes it hard for me to take them as evidence...)
Mechanic's Gloves data jotted down in my Organizer.
Motorcycle
Kay:
Wow! This bike is so cool! Look at that! It has a skull for a headlight!
Edgeworth:
Hmm. It seems the eyes light up when you turn on the headlights.
Kay:
Oooh. Well, I'm sure its eyes don't glare as well as yours, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(My eyes don't actually emit light when I glare, though...)
Shovel and sledgehammer
Edgeworth:
There are large tools hanging on the wall, such as a sledge hammer and a shovel.
Kay:
It's a lot bigger than the gavel Ms. Courtney carries around. If I ever become a judge, I'd want my gavel to be this big.
Edgeworth:
Swinging such a huge gavel in court would be intolerable. Please don't.
Kay:
Aww... Then I'll just swing the shovel that's beneath it instead.
Edgeworth:
That has no business being swung in court or elsewhere. Please don't.
Cement bag
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! There are huge bags of flour here! If I had some water and a rolling pin, I could make some noodles by hand! I'll slightly undercook them, so they have a nice, firm, al dente texture.
Edgeworth:
Kay, those are bags of cement mix, not flour. When mixed with water, it will harden. It's not something you'd want to sink your teeth into.
Kay:
Oh... I guess cement noodles shouldn't be cooked al dante...
Edgeworth:
(No. They shouldn't even be cooked in the first place.)
(Examining the "Cement bag", "Shovel and sledgehammer", "Gloves" and "Green box" leads to:)
???:
...*thump, thump*...
Edgeworth:
Hm?
Kay:
Th-There's someone inside!
???:
...*thump, thump*... *thump, thump*... *CRASH*!
Edgeworth:
Is it... John...?
Kay:
John! We're coming to save you! ......Eh?
Edgeworth:
(Th-This is...!) You're..... S-Sebastian!
Kay:
Whaaaaat!? Why!?
Debeste:
Nnnnf, Nmmnnnmmf!
Kay:
This is Blaise's house, right? That would mean...
Edgeworth:
Yes. It should also be Sebastian's house. (So then, why is he...?) Kay, go help him out.
Kay:
If it has to do with ropes, just leave it to Kay! Here I go! A little pull over here, and a quick tug over there! Are you alright, Sebastian?
Debeste:
..........
Edgeworth:
(He looks a little worse for wear.) Why were you tied up in a place like this?
Debeste:
.....How should I know!? Y-You guys don't know anything about me!
Edgeworth:
.....It's because we don't know. That's why we're asking you...
Debeste:
..........
Kay:
He's completely shut off his heart...
Edgeworth:
Indeed... If it's come to this... ...I suppose I have no choice but to use that.
Kay:
Ah! You mean!
Edgeworth:
I hate to do this when he's in such a fragile state. It's like kicking a man who's down...
Kay:
...Will it be alright? His mind might break if you corner him too much, y'know?
Edgeworth:
Yes. I am aware of that. I will try to be careful. (Good grief. I wonder how this will turn out... I've never held back against anyone before...)
Edgeworth:
After running out of the meeting room this morning, why would he be here of all places...?
Debeste:
You guys... You don't know how I feel!
5 CHESS PIECES
Edgeworth:
(He's gone through a lot of shock. He must be on the verge of an emotional meltdown.) It can't be helped... At times like this, I must quietly listen to what he has to say.
Debeste:
N-No one tells me anything... I'm always the only one being left out like an idiot...!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... I should try to answer his questions as best as I can.) Considering how fragile he is... I won't have much time to spare. I'll need to ask about his true feelings, and try to calm him down posthaste!
Begin Logic Chess
Tell me what's on your mind.
Leads to:
"Could you please tell me what's on your mind?"
You're a failure as a person!
Edgeworth:
From what I've seen these past few days... You have absolutely no redeeming qualities. Perhaps you should try starting over again... as a human being.
Debeste:
U... Ungh... UWAAAAAAAAAAHH!
Edgeworth:
Calm down! I'm not finished yet...
Debeste:
No way! I'm never gonna listen to you or anyone else again!
Edgeworth:
Urk...! I just said the one thing that I shouldn't have said...!
Infinite time loss
Edgeworth:
Could you please tell me what's on your mind?
Debeste:
I... I don't wanna! It's not like you'd listen to me anyways!
That's right! I never listen to you!
Edgeworth:
Do you understand? You have been cornered!
Debeste:
U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!
Edgeworth:
(Curses... If I make any pointless remarks, his mind will break.) Even so, he's someone that cries easily. Whether he's feeling down or he's losing his temper... ...he'll be crying either way, so I won't be able to tell the difference. I should try reading the emotion in what he's saying.

Debeste:
F-First... I'm returning this red jacket. I'm not fit to wear it. "Clothes fake the man." I think that's what Pops used to say... He knew all along I was a fake.
It's "clothes make the man".
Leads to:
"...It's not "fake", the saying is "clothes make the man". You are what you wear."
It would look much better on me.
Edgeworth:
Do you understand? You have been cornered!
Debeste:
U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!
Edgeworth:
(Curses... If I make any pointless remarks, his mind will break.) Even so, he's someone that cries easily. Whether he's feeling down or he's losing his temper... ...he'll be crying either way, so I won't be able to tell the difference. I should try reading the emotion in what he's saying.
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
........
Debeste:
Ooh... And now you're ignoring me... You just came to laugh at me, didn't you!?
Edgeworth:
C... Calm down! (It seems I waited a little too long...) Even so, he's someone that cries easily. Whether he's feeling down or he's losing his temper... ...he'll be crying either way, so I won't be able to tell the difference. I should try reading the emotion in what he's saying.
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
...It's not "fake", the saying is "clothes make the man". You are what you wear.
Debeste:
! Thank you... Mr. Edgeworth. I've learned something new, yet again.
Edgeworth:
Y... Yes. All you have to do now is become a prosecutor who is fit to wear that jacket.
Debeste:
Yeah. I'll do my best! That way, no one will ever make fun of me again!
You're getting too full of yourself.
Edgeworth:
Do you understand? You have been cornered!
Debeste:
U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!

But... how can I get people to accept me? Hmm... What do I do? I... I don't know what to do!
Before clearing second and third option
Edgeworth:
........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
After clearing second and third option
Leads to:
"For goodness' sake... Don't you remember your own words?"
Will you walk the same path as your father?
Edgeworth:
Will you... continue to ignore the truth, just like your father?
Debeste:
Please... stop it already...! I don't want your putty... Just leave me alone...
I believe you mean "pity".
Leads to:
"I believe "pity" is the word you're looking for."
I didn't mean to pity you.
Edgeworth:
Do you understand? You have been cornered!

Edgeworth:
I believe "pity" is the word you're looking for.
Debeste:
Oh! R-Really...?
Edgeworth:
I also have my own reasons... for wanting to speak with you. There was a time when I, too, did not seek the truth and continued to run away from it. However... thanks to a certain friend, I was able to realize my mistake.
Debeste:
That's nice... You're lucky, Mr. Edgeworth... I don't have anyone like that...
I will show you the way.
Leads to:
"If you have the courage to stand up... I will show you the way."
You may be right about that...

Edgeworth:
Only if you have the will for it, though...
Debeste:
I..... I don't wanna be like Pops!
Edgeworth:
So... he wants to surpass his own father. I understand his feelings clearly now.
After clearing third option
Edgeworth:
Sebastian says that he wants to surpass his father and continue to be a prosecutor. In other words... he wants to be a different prosecutor from his father. It's the first answer he's arrived at on his own. I'm sure if he has the will, he'll find his way.
Leads back to first
Will you walk the same path as your father? (after clearing this option)
Edgeworth:
I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.
Will you continue to be a prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
Do you still intend to continue as a prosecutor?
Debeste:
I don't really know... It's not like I became a prosecutor on my own. Because of that... do I even have the right to continue being a prosecutor...?
Decide that for yourself!
Leads to:
"Whether or not you continue as a prosecutor is something you must decide for yourself!"
Of course not!

Edgeworth:
So, he wants to continue to live as a prosecutor... I shall keep his will in mind.

As a prosecutor... didn't you want to walk a different path from your father? Certainly, the path you have chosen is not an easy one. Nevertheless, you still chose to live as a prosecutor. In that case, it should be clear to you what you need to do...!
1 PIECE BROKEN
Debeste:
!
Edgeworth:
...I still question how I live my life to this day. But you, Sebastian... have found your own answer. So believe in yourself, Prosecutor Debeste!
Debeste:
I... WAAAAAAAAAAH!
Edgeworth:
(He was mistaken for John, and kidnapped by Blaise's underlings. And after his father stole his evidence, he lost his confidence as a prosecutor... The emotions he is going through must be more painful than anything I could imagine.) It's taken longer than I thought... but with that, it's checkmate.
Logic Chess Complete
Debeste:
U-unh, uugh... ungh...! D... D-D-D-D... DARN IIIIIIIIIIIT!
Edgeworth:
..........
Kay:
H-He dashed out of here at full speed...
Edgeworth:
(It seems if there's one thing he's "the best" at, it's running away...)
April 6, 1:15 PMOutside Grand TowerTower Plaza
Edgeworth:
(Curses! We're running out of time...) We should check in with Mr. Shields. (I'd also like to know what the situation is like on their end.)
Kay:
But Mr. Debeste ran off again...
Edgeworth:
We'll just give them the new information we discovered. Franziska will take his place.
Kay:
Hmm... I wonder if that's going to be enough...
Edgeworth:
It can't be helped. Since he ran away, there's nothing more we can do.
District Court - Courtroom No. 3
Ray:
Eerm. I guess I'll just say it again. If there's no murder weapon, you can't prove the defendant is guilty.
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Just because we don't have the murder weapon, doesn't mean the defendant is innocent! It seems you wish to taste the sting of my whip.
Ray:
Gyaaah!
Roland:
Mr. Attorney. This trial... How much longer will it take? Because it feels like it hasn't gone anywhere at all for a good while now!
Ray:
Well, sorry, but that stubborn prosecutor over there just doesn't seem to understand.
Franziska:
Until I am satisfied... ...this whip will lash out at you as many times as I see fit.
Ray:
(By now, she's probably whipped me once for every year I've been alive... Miles... What's taking you so long? Even though we're just stalling for time, Uncle Ray can't keep this up much longer!) Whoops, 'scuse me. Phone call. Mind if I take this?
Courtney:
...I will allow it.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields.
Ray:
Oh, Miles, it's you. How's it going over there?
Edgeworth:
We found Sebastian.
Ray:
Oh! And the knife and chisel?
Edgeworth:
It seems he handed the evidence over to Blaise Debeste. It's very likely that Blaise knows the whereabouts of the murder weapon.
Ray:
Ex-chairman Debeste!? But, why would Blaise...?
Edgeworth:
That, I don't know yet. However, there may be some hidden connection between... ...Patricia Roland and Blaise.
Ray:
Gotcha. In that case, I'll issue a subpoena for Blaise Debeste right away.
Edgeworth:
!
Ray:
I'll grill him personally.
Edgeworth:
I will continue to search for the missing evidence. (And for John, as well...)
Ray:
Try to hurry it up, would ya? We're at our wits end over here! It feels like the verdict could be handed down at any moment!
Edgeworth:
Understood. (How much longer can Judge Courtney's heart hold out? I know she's in a lot of pain... I've got to hurry.)
Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza
Kay:
So? How's the trial going?
Edgeworth:
Blaise will be taking the stand. I don't know how things will turn out, though.
Kay:
He'll do anything, from hiding evidence to kidnapping... He really is nothing but trouble.
Edgeworth:
I agree. We should probably take another look at the evidence concerning him.
Kay:
OK! Leave it to me! First, here's the latest evidence fresh from the scene!
Edgeworth:
They're... the gloves from earlier. Although I am certainly curious about them... Anything else?
Kay:
The case files from the IS-7 Incident. If I recall, Blaise was also involved in this, right?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. He was involved in destroying the evidence. For now, let's keep this on hand.
IS-7 Incident Documents jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Now then... is there anything else?
Kay:
Of course! Last but not least... We've got this!
Edgeworth:
This is... the Yatagarasu's badge. ...Kay. I'm talking about things related to Blaise. Please be serious.
Kay:
But aren't you always going around presenting random evidence too, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Gah...! No... W-Well... That's... Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?)
Kay:
Ah! What're you doing here?
Debeste:
WHOOOOOOOAAAHH!
Kay:
H-He ignored us...
Edgeworth:
(He came out of the Grand Tower... What was he doing in there?)
Kay:
Let's go investigate what Mr. Debeste was up to!
Edgeworth:
Yes... Let us go.
Grand Tower - Rooftop
Edgeworth:
Hm? (The hatch is open...)
Kay:
It might be Mr. Debeste who opened it!
Grand Tower - 51st Floor Storeroom
Edgeworth:
(Did Sebastian come in here...?)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Over there! The safe's open!
Edgeworth:
(Did he come here to open that? ...Let's examine it thoroughly.)
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Notice anything?
Kay:
Somehow, we ended up finding Mr. Debeste instead... ...but there's still no trace of our main objective, John. Just where could they have taken him?
Edgeworth:
The only way to find out is to continue to question people and gather information. And we also must search for the missing murder weapon.
Kay:
We came in here because we saw Mr. Debeste running out of the Grand Tower... ...but I wonder if there's actually anything useful in here?
Edgeworth:
Sebastian must have come here because he thought there was. We have precious little time left. Let's investigate and see what we can find.
51st floor storeroom
Edgeworth:
To think that we would set foot back into this storeroom again...
Kay:
Now that you mention it, we were here just yesterday. Well, my memories were still lost back then! I didn't think about it at the time... ...but looking at this place now, it's like a glittering mountain of treasure!
Edgeworth:
Kay. Please don't touch anything in the storeroom needlessly!
Kay:
'Kay! But more importantly, Mr. Edgeworth! Something might have changed since we were last here! We'll need to closely examine every nook and cranny of the storeroom again!
Edgeworth:
(Something in the storeroom that has changed from before. Is there something like that?)
Desk on the left
Leads to:
"There's something inside the safe!"
Ladder
Kay:
Climbing ladders is pretty fun! C'mon, let's clear all the rungs in one go and jump outside!
Edgeworth:
Hold it. We'll leave after we've examined the safe by the display shelves.
Kay:
Well, hurry up then. I wanna go ladder climbing!
Edgeworth:
(Which is more important, the ladder of the investigation...?)
Masks
Kay:
It seems like there's something missing here, doesn't it?
Edgeworth:
Yes... you're right. (That Jammin' Ninja mask... I suppose it would be natural for her to remember the events that took place two days ago...)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. There are masks here, and on the rooftop there's a cotton candy stand. I guess, what's missing is... an apple bobbing station and a shooting gallery!
Edgeworth:
S-So that's what you meant. (I had no need to worry.)
Wooden trunk
Kay:
That chain was used to keep people from opening this box, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It is as you see.
Kay:
I can't just use rope escape tricks anymore. I need to learn chain escape tricks too! It really has become the dark age of Great Thieves.
Edgeworth:
(I suppose even thieves have their troubles...)
Trophies
Edgeworth:
It's the transceiver De Killer used to contact us.
Kay:
This is Codename Yatagarasu. Mr. Edgeworth, please respond, over!
Edgeworth:
.....What is it?
Kay:
I've successfully infiltrated the 51st floor of the Grand Tower! Report your current position!
Edgeworth:
I am also on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower. I'm standing right next to you.
Kay:
What!? You're here too!? I... But... when did you get here!?
Edgeworth:
I have no idea what you're doing, but could we hurry up and resume the investigation?
Kay:
Temporarily joining forces, eh. Heh... That doesn't sound half bad.
Edgeworth:
Well then, follow me.
Kay:
Roger, Mr. Edgeworth!
Statue
Kay:
Hmm... One, ten, a hundred...
Edgeworth:
Umm. What are you counting?
Kay:
The numbers on the sign in front of this statue..... a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand. T-Two point four... million!? 2.4 million ounces!? Just how many pounds is that, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
(At any rate, the floor does look like it is under a lot of weight.)
Yellow desk
Edgeworth:
The table top is being supported by four naked men. The design is quite painful to look at.
Kay:
But, it looks like a good place to hide under during an earthquake. No matter what heavy objects fall on top of it, I'm sure it will hold!
Edgeworth:
Hiding under that table would mean being surrounded by the four naked men, though.
Kay:
A Great Thief always works outdoors, so I don't really use desks much. Which means, I won't be the one hiding under it. It'll be YOU, Mr. Edgeworth! C'mon now, get in, get in!
Edgeworth:
.....I refuse.
Lift
Edgeworth:
It's pointless to go down to the meeting room. What's important right now is the storeroom.
Kay:
A hidden lift, along with a hidden ladder. Hmm... The person who made this place must've really liked hiding things.
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Is something on your mind?
Kay:
Yes. As a Great Thief, I'm always on the lookout for new hiding techniques. But don't worry, Mr. Edgeworth. I wouldn't do something like hide your fuzzy slippers.
Edgeworth:
(...Since when have I ever worn fuzzy slippers!?)
Money
Edgeworth:
It's the money that was used in the black market auction. (I hope Kay isn't tempted by it.)
Kay:
Stealing money seems to be the popular trend for thieves these days.
Edgeworth:
(...Is it really an issue of trendiness?)
Kay:
However... Heh heh heh. Don't worry, Mr. Edgeworth. The Great Thief Yatagarasu won't be swept away by the current trends!
Edgeworth:
(Current trends...? ...I should probably just leave it at that.)
Giant head
Kay:
Hey, look at this. It's a monkey head with a topknot!
Edgeworth:
This is the mascot of Global Studios. I've come across it before in a past case.
Kay:
I think I've also heard its name before. Monkey... Something Monkey... I've got it! "Madame Monkey"!
Edgeworth:
Almost, Kay. You were close. Its name is "Mrs. Monkey".
Kay:
Huh? Was that really what it was called? Hmm... I think "Madame monkey" sounds way better though.
Kay:
There's something inside the safe!
Edgeworth:
Let's go ahead and have a look. There are some documents in here...
Kay:
Hmm... it's just a bunch of papers and... huh? There's a photo here too.
Edgeworth:
Hm? This is a picture of...!
Kay:
Huh!? Th-That's Mr. Knightley!
Knightley:
...Horace Knightley. The president's bodyguard.
Kay:
Why is his picture here? And what are all of these papers for!?
Edgeworth:
I don't know... We will have to read the documents to find out.
I'm all but certain there is a connection between Knightley and Dogen. Dogen's chess partner, whose identity remained unknown until now... ...was actually Knightley all along. That is proof enough. Tomorrow, I shall interrogate him in the warden's office. I'll get him to confess that he's one of Dogen's henchmen. That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago... ...you simply must retrieve it.
Edgeworth:
This... seems to be a report about Knightley.
Kay:
Not to mention, it was apparently written before Knightley was killed...!
Edgeworth:
(Horace Knightley was murdered while he was being interrogated in the warden's office...) Judging from the contents, this document was probably written by Patricia Roland.
Kay:
I knew it!
Edgeworth:
The question, however, is who this report was addressed to.
Kay:
Ah! The owner of this safe is...!
Edgeworth:
The Conductor... Blaise Debeste.
Kay:
So, this proves that Ms. Roland and Blaise are connected!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. However, it's not just the two of them.
Kay:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste and Patricia Roland were searching for Dogen's henchmen.
Kay:
Sirhan Dogen! That dog-loving assassin!
Edgeworth:
This means that there is a hidden connection between the three of them.
Kay:
I wonder what it could be?
Edgeworth:
I don't know, but it must be related to this case.
Report on Knightley jotted down in my Organizer.
Kay:
Ah! There's some other stuff in here that I remember seeing!
Edgeworth:
Hm? There's something on his finger.
Kay:
Let's have a closer look! Oh! It looks like an expensive ring!
Edgeworth:
Don't steal it.
Kay:
Wha...! I didn't do anything yet!
Edgeworth:
It's Horace Knightley's... The chessboard and the ring... All of his possessions are inside this safe.
Kay:
So basically, all of this stuff is evidence from the prison case?
Edgeworth:
Correct.
Kay:
Then, the knife and chisel that vanished might be in here too! Let's see. Mr. Knife... Mr. Chisel... Hmm. They're not in there... I guess this is all just Mr. Knightley's stuff.
Edgeworth:
I see... That's too bad. (Horace Knightley... is dead.)
Knightley:
EEEEEDGEWOOOOOORTH!!! This game isn't over yet! You hear me! I...! I...!
Edgeworth:
(However, the game is not over yet... ...unless I can see it through to its end!)
Knightley's Mementos data jotted down in my Organizer.
Desk on the left (subsequent times)
Kay:
All the evidence from the prison case is here, but the knife and chisel are nowhere to be found.
Edgeworth:
It can't be helped. Let's climb back up to the viewing platform and exit the Grand Tower.
Kay:
It's about time! Climbing ladders is something I never get tired of.
Edgeworth:
(I think you're the only one who feels that way...)
Grand Tower - Rooftop
???:
Young lady, good sir. ...Might I interest you in some cotton candy?
Edgeworth:
Hm?
???:
There is also ice cream, if that is what you'd prefer?
Edgeworth:
Y-You! Sh-Shelly de Killer!
de Killer:
It's good to see you are well, Mr. Edgeworth.
Kay:
Wh-What are you doing in a place like this!?
de Killer:
As you can see, I am selling cotton candy. Would you care for some "Heavenly Cotton Candy"? Even sweeter than death. One bite will send you straight to heaven.
Edgeworth:
(That's definitely not something I'd want to buy from De Killer.)
de Killer:
The meaning of my message... Have you understood it?
de Killer:
I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved?
Edgeworth:
Have you been spying on us this whole time?
de Killer:
Spying? Heavens no. I was simply watching over you... ...while disguised as a cotton candy salesman.
Edgeworth:
(Isn't that the exact same thing!? What is this man's objective?) Were you the one... who murdered the president?
de Killer:
No. The contact with my client has already expired. ...President Huang is a bit of a celebrity in the world of assassins, you see. Over the years, many attempts on his life were made, and yet, he stubbornly lives on. He is a robust man, surrounded by flawless security. He even employs body doubles.
Edgeworth:
(Robust... That president? Rotund seems more apt.) ...However, it seems this time the president's security wasn't exactly flawless.
Kay:
Mr. Rooke had only just prevented your previous assassination, but this time...!
de Killer:
I did not kill him. It is not my principle to kill needlessly. I am also grateful to Rooke, a worthy adversary who was connected to me by fate. Thanks to that man, I did not kill a target who had no value to be killed.
Edgeworth:
("Thanks" to Rooke preventing the assassination... What does he mean?)
de Killer:
My client deliberately gave me a false target. ...It was a betrayal most foul. I am now searching for my client. In all likelihood... ...it is the same person you are looking for.
Edgeworth:
(Is he saying that his client murdered the president?) Just who is this person you are referring to...?
de Killer:
I, myself, am not allowed to say. It would be a violation of the rules. I cannot disclose the identity of my clients. For to do so would create a problem of trust with my other clients. This is precisely why I am personally searching for them myself.
Kay:
What are you going to do when you find your client?
de Killer:
Of course... they shall be rewarded with a punishment most befitting of a traitor.
Kay:
Whaaaa!? That person... Wh-What'll happen to them?
de Killer:
...I will leave that up to your imagination.
Edgeworth:
(It certainly won't be anything pleasant...)
de Killer:
Oh, yes... I will tell you just one more thing. Three days ago, Sirhan Dogen escaped from prison.
Edgeworth:
What!?
de Killer:
Three nights past, Dogen's solitary cell was found vacant. It was almost as if he knew I would come pay a visit.
Edgeworth:
(He visited Dogen's cell? Could it be, that the person De Killer is searching for is...)
de Killer:
Well then, if you'll excuse me, I must get going. Let us both do our best in tracking down that person...
Edgeworth:
(So, De Killer and Dogen. These two assassins...)
Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. This sound is...)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Judge Courtney's cellphone is ringing!
Edgeworth:
(Could it be John?)
???:
Mr. Edgeworth. How are you doing?
Edgeworth:
(It sounds like they're using a voice changer...) Who is this?
???:
Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood...
Edgeworth:
(The red hood?) ...Are you the person who ambushed Kay?
???:
Brilliant deduction! I'd expect no less from a prodigy prosecutor such as yourself!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too!
Edgeworth:
Very well. (I'll put it on speaker...)
???:
Well, I must say that I didn't expect the girl to get amnesia.
Kay:
Hey! What's that supposed to mean!?
???:
But that's not all, y'see. Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane.
Edgeworth:
What!? (This must be the person De Killer spoke of...!)
???:
I really should thank you, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
You have no reason to thank me!
???:
Oh, you haven't noticed? My, that's troublesome, y'know. I wanted you to catch Blaise for me... ...so I took dear little Kay.
Edgeworth:
What?
???:
If Kay was suspected, I knew you would investigate the case. And I was sure that the great Miles Edgeworth would be able to catch Blaise! It was according to my plan! And y'know, I get the feeling that you have the wrong idea, so let me clear something up. Blaise Debeste wasn't the one who kidnapped Ms. Courtney's son.
Edgeworth:
! You... Why do you know about the kidnapping?
???:
You and Ms. Courtney are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you...
Edgeworth:
(How could this person know something like that...? Judge Courtney was supposed to have visited me using the detective's name...)
???:
I bet you're wondering how I knew about the kidnapping, right? It's quite simple, really! It's because darling little John is in my care right now.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Kay:
Huh!?
???:
You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Quickly, little Kay! You have to hurry and steal him back! You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you?
Kay:
You even know it's my first job!?
Edgeworth:
(Why does this person know everything in so much detail?)
???:
Well... I suppose I can't blame you for your mistake. It seems Blaise was after John as well, y'see.
Edgeworth:
(So there were two kidnappings...)
???:
He's such a fool, y'know. Kidnapping his own son instead!
Edgeworth:
Is John there with you? If he is, then I would like to hear his voice.
???:
Hmm. He's here, but I'm afraid I can't do that. Y'see, he's asleep right now.
Edgeworth:
In that case, there's no way for us to know if you really kidnapped John or not.
???:
...Hmph. I suppose you don't have to believe me if you don't want to.
Edgeworth:
What is your objective? Is it to get Patricia Roland declared not guilty?
???:
A not guilty verdict, eh... I couldn't care less about that.
Edgeworth:
(So his objective is different from Blaise's?)
???:
...I think I'll keep my objective a secret for now. Well then, I must be going. I hope you enjoy yourself, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Don't think you can get away with this.
???:
Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that.
*BOOM*
Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
Kay:
Who in the world was that...?
Edgeworth:
I don't know. We don't have enough information.
Kay:
Darn it! We're totally clueless! Meanwhile, they seem to know everything about us!
Edgeworth:
! (Know everything about us...?) Kay, you're right. Thinking about it, it is strange. How does the culprit know so much about us?
Kay:
It's so weird! I mean they even know about the kidnapping!
Edgeworth:
We must figure out how the culprit was able to obtain that information. (I must recall... What exactly did that person know?)
???:
You and Ms. Courtney are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you...
???:
You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you?
Kay:
You even know it's my first job!?
???:
You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces.
Edgeworth:
(That's it! By analyzing our conversation with the culprit...!) I've figured it out, Kay. I know the source of this person's information!
Kay:
What!? Really!?
Edgeworth:
In all likelihood, this person probably...
Has been tailing us
Edgeworth:
Perhaps they have been tailing us?
Kay:
Whaaaat!? So we're being followed!? Shadowing a Great Thief such as myself cannot go unpunished! But... isn't it a bit weird?
Edgeworth:
Hm? Why do you say that?
Kay:
Well, didn't the person say they couldn't see the look on our faces? If they were following us, they should be able to see our faces...
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (That's certainly true...)
Kay:
If our faces can't be seen, it limits the possibilities!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. In that case, there is only one way possible.
Leads back to:
"In all likelihood, this person probably..."
Has been taking photos of us
Edgeworth:
They have probably been secretly taking photos of us.
Kay:
Whaaaat!? They've been taking pictures of us!? I won't forgive creeps who secretly take pictures of cute girls like me! Let's catch 'em and give 'em their just desserts! ...But, hmm. Are they really taking photos of us?
Edgeworth:
Hm? Is something the matter?
Kay:
Well, didn't the person say they couldn't see the look on our faces? If they were taking our photos, they would've been able to see our faces!
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (I can't argue with that...) If our faces can't be seen, it limits the possibilities.
Kay:
Then there's only one way!
Leads back to:
"In all likelihood, this person probably..."
Has planted a bug on us
Leads to:
"I believe it is highly likely that we have been bugged."
Edgeworth:
I believe it is highly likely that we have been bugged.
Kay:
B-Bugged!?
Edgeworth:
If you recall what that person said...
???:
You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces.
Edgeworth:
If they couldn't see our faces, that means they weren't talking our pictures or following us.
Kay:
Th-Then, they must've planted a bug somewhere! Could it be in my stuff...?
Edgeworth:
(Was there anything they could have had a chance to bug...? There must be a hint somewhere in our conversation just now... That's right... that person knew something they shouldn't have. The conversation between Judge Courtney and myself in the visitor's room...)
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney!
Courtney:
Hush. Please, have a seat.
Edgeworth:
(The only evidence I had with me at the time was...!) Where was the bug planted...?
Present Yatagarasu's Badge
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Kay. May I see your badge?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
The kidnapper probably planted a bug inside this.
Kay:
Hmm. It'd be kinda hard to put a bug into something like that...
Edgeworth:
Ngh! (It seems that wasn't it...)
Kay:
Let's try remembering what the kidnapper said over the phone!
Edgeworth:
(That person knew something they shouldn't have known. The conversation between Judge Courtney and myself in the visitor's room...)
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney!
Courtney:
Hush. Please, have a seat.
Edgeworth:
(If he somehow eavesdropped on that conversation... The only things he could have bugged would have been what I had with me at the time!)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. Where was the bug planted!?
Leads back to:
"(The only evidence I had with me at the time was...!)"
Edgeworth:
Kay. May I see your badge?
Kay:
My Yatagarasu's badge? No way!
Edgeworth:
Wh-Why not...?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, just because you became a Great Thief's assistant... ...doesn't mean you're ready to wear this badge yet!
Edgeworth:
That's not it! It's very likely that a bug was planted in it.
Kay:
Whaaat!? In my badge?
Edgeworth:
Let's take a closer look.
Examine front side
Edgeworth:
I've been wondering about this for some time now... Did you inherit that badge from your predecessor too?
Kay:
Nope! There wasn't one, so I made my own!
Edgeworth:
I thought so... It is rather conspicuous. I think you're just about the only thief who'd ever want to wear something like that.
Kay:
Hey! Stop making fun of me!
Examine back side
Leads to:
"Ah! This is...!"
Kay:
Ah! This is...!
Edgeworth:
It seems I was right.
Yatagarasu's Badge data updated in my Organizer.
Kay:
How did you know?
Examine evidence
Back side of Yatagarasu's Badge
Edgeworth:
Kay, I'd like to check the inside of your badge...
Kay:
OK, I'm on it! ...But, you didn't have to ask, you could have just done it yourself... Ah! Or maybe you can't open it yourself because you're so clumsy?
Edgeworth:
Just open it already!
Kay:
Alright!
Edgeworth:
There was a bug planted in here.
Kay:
Letting an opponent get ahead of you is the biggest mistake a person can make.
Edgeworth:
(I wonder what got her so worked up?)
Edgeworth:
The person had been in contact with you.
Kay:
You mean, when I was knocked unconscious.
Edgeworth:
Yes. That's why I thought one of your possessions might have been bugged. However, that person also overheard my conversation with Judge Courtney. Even though that conversation took place in the visitor's room with just the two of us...
Kay:
Ah, so you were holding onto it at that time...
Edgeworth:
Exactly. All the other evidence had been taken away from me... Only the Yatagarasu's badge remained with me.
Kay:
So this creep's been listening in on us the whole time!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. That must be how they knew about all the information we collected.
Kay:
Does that mean... they're also listening in on this conversation?
Edgeworth:
Most likely.
Kay:
Hey, buster!
Edgeworth:
K-Kay...
Kay:
Eavesdropping is for cowards! Why don't you come out here and fight us fair and square!?
Edgeworth:
(Hm? What was that sound just now?)
Nicole:
Owwwwwwww...
Kay:
Huh? That's... Nicole!
Nicole:
Honestly, y'all scared the bejeezus out of me! Your voice was so loud there, Lil' Missy... I was so surprised I done fell flat on my behind!
Kay:
I-I'm sorry...!
Nicole:
What were ya gettin' so riled up for?
Kay:
You gotta hear this! It really grinds my gears!
Nicole:
Yes, yes?
Edgeworth:
...Kay. Please just leave it at that. Unless you want to make tomorrow morning's headlines.
Kay:
Ah! That was close...
Nicole:
Aww, shucks. Don't be such a stick in the mud... What's wrong with lettin' a gal open her heart and spill the beans?
Edgeworth:
(For now, I'll turn the bug off.)
Bug data jotted down in my Organizer.
Nicole:
So... did ya find the kidnappers?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift. Was the boy you saw being kidnapped... ...this boy in the photo?
Nicole:
Hmm? Nope, they ain't nothin' alike. He had a more stupid-lookin' face, and was wearin' a collared school uniform...
Kay:
I thought so...
Edgeworth:
(Yet again, we were led astray by this woman's testimony...) We will have to conduct our investigation all over again. So, we're back where we started. Are there any new leads...? (There's only 20 minutes left until 2 o'clock! Will we be able to make it in time...?)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Mr. Edgeworth! About that phone call just now... Wasn't there a strange sound at the end?
Edgeworth:
A strange sound...?
Edgeworth:
Don't think you can get away with this.
???:
Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that.
*BOOM*
Edgeworth:
Now that you mention it... It sounded like an explosion (Sound of an explosion - Sound of an explosion was heard during the call from the kidnapper.). It might be a hint to establish the culprit's whereabouts...
Nicole:
Mm-hmm. I see, I see. The sound of an explosion, eh?
Edgeworth:
Hmph! I would appreciate it if you stopped eavesdropping on us!
Nicole:
Mr. Prosecutor... Yer as stingy as ever.
Edgeworth:
(...First, let's see what she has to say...)
Begin Investigation
Outside Grand TowerTower Plaza
Logic
"Cars that came through" and "Garbage pickup area"
Edgeworth:
The only vehicles that came through the plaza this morning were the taxi and a blue truck.
Kay:
And Mr. Debeste was kidnapped in that taxi.
Edgeworth:
Yes. Meanwhile, John was attacked in the garbage pickup area... ...and the garbage was collected from there at 11 AM.
Gumshoe:
...Aaah! I've got it, sir! The blue truck was actually...
Edgeworth:
That's right. The blue truck that came through the plaza was a garbage truck. However, be that as it may, the officer who gave us this information... ...made no mention that the blue truck was a garbage truck.
Kay:
Talk about careless! How could someone mistake a garbage truck for a normal truck!?
Edgeworth:
That's not it, Kay. Today was the day for the collection of bulk waste. I suspect it was a standard truck without a trash compactor that came by to collect the trash. ...John was taken away by this garbage truck. And where do garbage trucks go?
Gumshoe:
To the dump, of course!
Kay:
Hold up! The culprit was disguised as a garbage collector, right? Then the truck was probably fake, too. How do we know they really went to the dump?
Edgeworth:
...No, the garbage truck should have been real.
Kay:
Eh! Why's that?
Edgeworth:
That will be made clear if you simply take a look at the garbage pickup area. This shows that the garbage truck John was kidnapped in was real...
Present lock
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The garbage pickup area is locked."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Kay:
Mmmmm! There's something important there?
Edgeworth:
This spot alone is evidence enough that the garbage truck was a real one. Wouldn't you agree?
Kay:
No I don't!
Edgeworth:
Ngh! (So it wasn't here? If it wasn't a real garbage truck, it wouldn't have been able to collect the trash. Wasn't there something around here that proves that?)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! What makes you think that the garbage truck was real!?
Leads back to:
"This shows that the garbage truck John was kidnapped in was real..."
Edgeworth:
The garbage pickup area is locked.
Kay:
Ah! Only a real garbage collector could have unlocked it to collect the trash!
Edgeworth:
Precisely. We should assume that a genunine garbage truck was used. For example, the kidnapper could have put John into a large cardboard box. If the box was mixed in with the rest of the bulk waste...
Kay:
...the garbage collector would have carried John away without even knowing it!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. The culprit would then lie in wait at the garbage dump... ...and if they said, "I threw it away by mistake", the box would be returned to them.
Kay:
Hmm. Any garbage dumps nearby... Let's see... Ah! There's two of them!
Edgeworth:
(So, which garbage dump (Which garbage dump? - John was likely taken to one of these two places. Which one was it?) was he taken to...? Could there be a hint in any of the information I hold...?)
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Notice anything?
Kay:
Secretly bugging my badge like that... I'm sure the Great Thief must be a skilled Great Thief!
Edgeworth:
I don't think simply placing a bug would warrant someone being called a Great Thief.
Kay:
What are you saying!? One who wishes to become a Great Thief must not neglect information gathering! Even so, to be able to plant a bug without anyone noticing... How dare they act more Great Thief-like than me!
Edgeworth:
(I feel like you're getting upset for all the wrong reasons.)
Marsh's whereabouts
Kay:
We haven't seen any sign of John at all. Where on earth could he have gone...?
Edgeworth:
At any rate, we have no choice but to continue investigating. Let's search this area again.
Kay:
Alright! Let's scour the area for any signs of John!
Detective Gumshoe (appears after talking to Gumshoe)
Kay:
It's just like Gummy to keep on investigating tirelessly.
Edgeworth:
It seems that giving up my prosecutor's badge has caused trouble for the detective as well.
Kay:
Even though Gummy had a lot on his plate to deal with... ...he was still worrying about me! That makes me so happy! Ah! Of course, I'm also grateful to you as well, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I only did what I felt was natural.
Kay:
Sheesh, you never say what you really mean! Speaking of which, Gummy was investigating somewhere around this area, right? In that case, maybe he knows something about John!
Edgeworth:
That's right. We should listen to what the detective has to say.
Trailer
Edgeworth:
This is a shuttle bus used for filming on location. It's also used as a trailer for the actors.
Kay:
So it's a bus. In that case, I wonder how much the fare is and where the destinations are.
Edgeworth:
This is obviously the property of Global Studios. There wouldn't be a fare. And naturally, the destination changes depending on where they're scheduled to film.
Kay:
A bus that takes you anywhere without needing to pay a fare!? I-It's like a dream come true!
Edgeworth:
(That would be a regular car, Kay.)
Film equipment
Edgeworth:
Pieces of filming equipment are lined up here.
Kay:
With all this stuff lying around, they're practically begging for it to be stolen!
Edgeworth:
.....Kay.
Kay:
I knoooow! I just wanted to try saying it. If I stole Global Studios' filming equipment, there would be no more Steel Samurai films. Fans across the world would weep for all eternity. ...Including you, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(That wasn't why I was trying to stop you...)
Will Powers
Edgeworth:
Mr. Powers. I know it might be a boorish question, but there's something I'd like to ask you.
Powers:
OK... Wh-What is it?
Edgeworth:
Are there perhaps any plans to make a new Steel Samurai?
Powers:
Um, I'm sorry, but... is that a question related to the investigation?
Edgeworth:
No. It's just a personal question.
Powers:
I'm sorry... I can't talk about it with people outside the studio, not even you, Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Gah! O-Of course. (As I thought, he cannot talk about it. However... ...he didn't deny it outright. Does that mean there's hope...?)
Nicole Swift
Nicole:
All my hard work's helped move the case forward. I reckon it's all in a good day's work!
Kay:
I'm not so sure about it... We've been chasing after an entirely different person.
Edgeworth:
(Indeed. It seems she did not properly examine the photo earlier...)
Nicole:
What now, was my info really all that bad?
Edgeworth:
No. Some of the blame also falls on us for relying on a dubious information source. It's time for us to regroup and start over...
Nicole:
C-Could ya hold on a sec? If ya think I'm stayin' quiet after bein' called a dubious source, ya got another thing comin'! Fine then... Guess I'll just have to tell you about the scoop I've been sayin'!
Edgeworth:
(You've been saving... a scoop?)
The scoop
Edgeworth:
...Although I'm not expecting much, let's hear it. What is this scoop of yours?
Nicole:
It's Moozilla! I have decisive evidence that the Mighty Moozilla exists!
Edgeworth:
OK. Let's go, Kay.
Nicole:
Hold up! I'm bein' serious! Y'all might not believe it, but it's true!
Edgeworth:
(We don't have much time, but... I guess there's no other way.) ...Would this decisive evidence of yours be something you recorded on that tape recorder?
Nicole:
That's Mr. Edgeworth for ya! Yer good at figurin' things out, aren't ya!? It's the sound of Moozilla spewin' out fire. This place nearly became a sea of flames!
Edgeworth:
(...If you say so.)
Nicole:
D-Don't make that face... If ya think I'm lyin', then have a listen for yerself! Ready!? ......Here comes the flame! GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGH Ghh..... gh... g..... ...H-How was that?
Kay:
Hmm. It's hard to tell over your shouting... but if you say so, I guess they could be flames.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift. Did you truly witness these so-called flames?
Nicole:
W-Well... to tell ya the truth, I didn't really see it with my own two eyes. On account of... umm, I wasn't actually there at the time.
Edgeworth:
If Moozilla had appeared, wouldn't you have noticed no matter where you were?
Nicole:
Erm, well... I was a ways off, and was usin' a slightly unusual recordin' method, so...
Edgeworth:
...Hmm. Could you explain to me this recording method in more detail?
Nicole:
Uuugh... Guess I just dug my own grave...
The recording method (appears after The scoop)
Nicole:
Truth is, I was aimin' for a scoop... so I did me some wireless wiretappin'.
Kay:
...Wait a minute. Wireless wiretapping? If there's no wires, how'd you tap them?
Edgeworth:
Kay. Please don't concern yourself with the semantics. She was simply intercepting wireless communications and listening in without permission.
Nicole:
...I've been spendin' the last few days scopin' out the Grand Tower with my mentor.
Edgeworth:
So you were investigating the black market auctions... In that case, you naturally would have tapped the immediate area surrounding the Grand Tower.
Nicole:
You betcha. But... right then and there, I hear an ear-shatterin' roar! Finally, Moozilla appears! My heart is poundin'! I feel him drawin' near!
Kay:
...So, everything except the sound is just her own personal impressions, right?
Edgeworth:
In the end, it seems that you didn't actually see anything.
Nicole:
Well, I reckon writing's more my thing. Anyways, as I continued tuning in to the situation... ...Lil' Miss Kay over there almost shatters my eardrums!
Kay:
Eavesdropping is for cowards! Why don't you come out here and fight us fair and square!?
Edgeworth:
(Hm? What was that sound just now?)
Edgeworth:
...Hmph, I see. Ms. Swift. While you were eavesdropping, you were surprised by Kay's voice and fell over. In other words, you did not hear her voice directly... You heard it via the radio waves emitted by the bug, did you not?
Kay:
Whaaat!? Th-Then does that mean the one who planted the bug on me was...
Nicole:
I-I was just eavesdroppin'! I'd never stoop to buggin' nobody...
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift. Do you mind if we borrow that tape for a while?
Nicole:
Uuugh... Just do what ya please already...
Sign
Kay:
It's a guide map of the area around the Grand Tower. Let's see...
Dick Gumshoe
Kay:
Gummy! Why are you running away!?
Gumshoe:
........
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe...
Gumshoe:
When Mr. Edgeworth gave up his prosecutor's badge... ...I just didn't know what to do.
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe! Don't follow me!
Gumshoe:
......And then, I began to think. If Mr. Edgeworth isn't a prosecutor anymore... ...does that mean I'm no longer a detective?
Edgeworth:
!
Gumshoe:
...But that's not true. Even without Mr. Edgeworth, I'm still a detective! And investigating is my job! Detectives don't investigate just for the sake of prosecutors, pal. That's why... even if I'm on my own, I won't stop investigating!
Kay:
So, you've been investigating by yourself?
Edgeworth:
(Then perhaps, at that time...)
Franziska:
.....You should thank your "former" subordinate. He gave me some valuable information which may save Kay Faraday.
Edgeworth:
! (Detective Gumshoe did...)
Edgeworth:
So, Jill Crane's autopsy report...
Gumshoe:
I went to the detention center to see how Kay was doing. That's when I heard...
Blaise:
When you get to where I am, you can just create your own truths. Anytime you want. Kay Faraday is the culprit. That was a truth that I simply manufactured out of thin air.
Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
Blaise:
...Good, very good. That face. That expression!
Edgeworth:
You heard that conversation?
Gumshoe:
That's right. And that's why I looked over the evidence again myself, sir.
Kay:
Gummy, that's amazing! So it was you who saved me!
Gumshoe:
Kay... I'm really glad you got your memories back!
Kay:
Thank you...
Gumshoe:
Do you get it now? I can investigate on my own.
Kay:
Gummy! Don't run away! You've already proven that you can investigate on your own. After all, you saved me!
Gumshoe:
........
Edgeworth:
Detective. I need your help. Currently, I'm not a prosecutor, nor am I much of anything else. Even so, I will pursue this case. I ask you not as a prosecutor, but as a friend... Detective Gumshoe... Will you help us?
Gumshoe:
...Ooh. P-Please, cut it out, sir. ..........
Kay:
Gummy!
Gumshoe:
........ OK, I get it! I get it, pal! I can't bear to see Mr. Edgeworth bowing his head to me like this!
Kay:
Gummy!
Edgeworth:
Thank you, Detective...
Gumshoe:
What do you want me to do, sir...?
The investigation
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please tell me what you've found in your investigation so far.
Gumshoe:
Roger! Leave it to me, sir! I have three things to report! First up, is about Kay's clothes that were sent to the crime lab! Traces of an extremely powerful sleeping drug called Sleepy zZz were found on them!
Edgeworth:
So that means, after Kay was drugged at Gourd Lake... ...she was brought to the rood of the Grand Tower.
Gumshoe:
That's right, sir! Now, for item number two... The footage from the security camera at the Grand Tower's elevator.
Edgeworth:
(The footage that captured President Huang and Judge Courtney going up to the roof.) The elevator is generally the only way to get to the rooftop. And if the elevator was used, the person who used it would be caught on camera...
Gumshoe:
Exactly! In other words, if you look over the footage from a couple of days ago... ...you should be able to see an unconscious Kay being carried up to the roof!
Kay:
Then, Gummy! Does that mean you...!?
Gumshoe:
I checked out all the footage from before the incident two days ago on fast-forward!
Edgeworth:
I see. And the results?
Gumshoe:
Well, actually... nothing came up, sir. Kay never showed up on the tape at all...
Edgeworth:
(That was unexpected... I guess it won't be so easy. How was Kay brought up to the roof of the tower? I should take a moment to carefully consider the possibilities.) Well then, let's hear your third and final report.
Gumshoe:
Yessir! Last but not least, the most important thing to report... I'm so happy to be able to investigate with you again, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm gonna give it my all to arrest the culprit! ...That is all, sir!
Edgeworth:
(Hmph. I apologize for putting you through so much, Detective Gumshoe. However...) ...That was your most important report? It had nothing to do with the case at all. I would have preferred something that's actually useful.
Gumshoe:
Ugh... That merciless attitude, that's the Mr. Edgeworth I know, sir!
The kidnapping
Edgeworth:
A young boy had been kidnapped. I want you to help us search for him.
Gumshoe:
A k-kidnapping, sir!?
Edgeworth:
The victim is a boy by the name of John Marsh.
Gumshoe:
Ah! That kid with the horns!
Edgeworth:
Yes. Do you know about him?
Gumshoe:
I saw that boy myself, sir.
Edgeworth:
Was that this morning?
Gumshoe:
That's right! He came out of that trailer over there, and then... ...he walked towards the garbage pickup area.
Kay:
The garbage pickup area?
Gumshoe:
It's right over there, pal. That's where all the trash from the Grand Tower's offices is collected. I don't know what happened after that. Since I left the place around then...
Edgeworth:
(It seems we must investigate the garbage pickup area.)
Present
Yatagarasu's Badge
Gumshoe:
That's Kay's Badge, right? It's just as cool as a prosecutor's badge, isn't it, sir? But, Mr. Edgeworth's badge... was... ooh...
Kay:
It's fine! Don't cry, Gummy. Even if Mr. Edgeworth quits being a prosecutor... ...I'm sure someone else will lower your salary for you during your salary assessments.
Gumshoe:
Someone else... will lower my... ...Ooh... Oooohhh...!
Edgeworth:
(...Is he crying about his pay being cut, or that it will be someone else cutting it...?)
Letter from Unknown
Gumshoe:
It looks like Kay's back to her old energetic self!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. A little too energetic, I might add.
Kay:
It's all thanks to Gummy and Mr. Edgeworth saving me! Thank you! I really, really mean it!
Gumshoe:
No need to thank us. All that matters is that you're back to your healthy self, Kay! Speaking of which, you had a bunch of bandages wrapped around your head... Have your injuries already healed, pal?
Kay:
You bet! Those bandages were just to help my memories come back faster... They were really just replacements for a headband, to reignite my fighting spirit!
Edgeworth:
(You could have mentioned that part sooner...)
Crime Scene Notes, Moozilla's Head or Monster's Footprints
Gumshoe:
President Huang's assassination... Things sure have taken a turn for the worse, sir. When I decided to investigate the case on my own... ...I tried to remember all the techniques you would use, Mr. Edgeworth. And above all else, what's most important is this...! Even if something seems impossible at first glance, we must still suspect it!
Edgeworth:
Certainly, you are correct. ...So far, at least.
Gumshoe:
Monsters don't actually exist in this world. But, if that's what it seems at first glance... ...perhaps we should suspect that President Huang really was trampled by a monster! Thinking outside of the box like this is really important! Isn't it, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
(Oh, Detective Gumshoe. So close, and yet so painfully far.)
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Ha ha ha! Mr. Edgeworth, you're such a joker! Even if you show that to me, I still have no idea what it is, sir!
Edgeworth:
(He proclaimed that quite proudly...)
Taxi
Driver:
Oh, it's you two again. Did something else come up? Hurry and hop on board!
Edgeworth:
No, right now we don't really need to go anywhere...
Driver:
Pish posh, that's what they all say! I can tell what you're after just by looking at your face. You wanna start a new life in a new place with a new girl, am I right? Come traffic lights or police sirens, I won't let anything stop you from where you're going! So come on! Hop in and experience the best ride of your life!
Edgeworth:
(With that personality, I guess it explains why he was so willing to help us out earlier...)
Officer
Edgeworth:
Is the guard duty going well?
Officer:
Yes, sir! Of course! Besides using my eyes and ears, I am also trying to use my sense of smell, touch, and even taste... I am going to revolutionize the way we do guard duty in this stodgy institution!
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but please perform your guard duty the way it's always been done.
Gate on right (after clearing all "Talk" options of Gumshoe)
Kay:
Gummy said John headed towards the garbage pickup area...!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. There might be some traces of him left behind.
Before examining sign and milk carton
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining sign and milk carton
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Sign
Edgeworth:
(The garbage pickup time is at 11 AM... So that's why there's no trash.)
Gumshoe:
When I looked here earlier, the place was overflowing with garbage, sir.
Kay:
Looks like today is the day when bulk waste is collected during the garbage pickup.
Gumshoe:
There really were a lot of bulky items placed here, pal.
Kay:
The garbage truck's compactor can crush any kind of garbage to dust!
Edgeworth:
No, it seems in the case of bulk waste, it is transported as is, without being crushed.
Gumshoe:
Huh... Why do you know about how bulk waste is disposed of, Mr. Edgeworth?
Kay:
Ah! Maybe Mr. Shields, in order to accomplish his Mr. Edgeworth acquisition plan... ...sent him something like a moving process instructional brochure!
Edgeworth:
(There are times when you're so sharp, it's scary... Although, they're few and far between.)
Gate
Kay:
It's surprisingly empty, isn't it?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It seems the garbage has just recently been collected.
Kay:
I wonder, what if the garbage wasn't really collected? Maybe someone stole it all! Mr. Edgeworth! I smell a case!
Edgeworth:
There certainly is... a faint smell of something. (Is this truly the smell of a case, though?)
Lock
Kay:
Looks like the garbage pickup area is locked.
Edgeworth:
It's probably to prevent people outside of the Grand Tower from disposing of their trash here.
Milk carton
Edgeworth:
! This milk carton is...!
Kay:
It's the one John was drinking out of!
Edgeworth:
There's no mistake, something must have happened to John here.
Kay:
But, why would John have come to a place like this?
Edgeworth:
It would be natural to think that he came here to throw something away...
Kay:
We have no way of knowing, since the garbage truck has already collected everything.
(Examining sign and milk carton leads to:)
Edgeworth:
Combined with Detective Gumshoe's testimony... ...the chances are high that John was attacked at the garbage pickup area (Garbage pickup area - John's milk carton was found here. Likely the place he was attacked.).
Kay:
If it was here, there wouldn't be many witnesses.
(Clearing all "Talk" options of Nicole leads to:)
Nicole's Tape Recorder data jotted down in my Organizer.
???:
Mr. Edgewooooorth!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes, Ms. Berry!
Simon:
D-Did you find him?
Kay:
Not yet. Just where could John be...?
Simon:
John?
Kay:
Ah! No, no! It's nothing! Don't worry about it.
Edgeworth:
(They don't know anything about the kidnapping.) Regarding Sebastian, we found him not too long ago.
Simon:
Really!? That's great! Thank you so much! Now I won't be arrested again.
Logic
"Sound of an explosion" and "Event at the Coliseum"
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes, didn't you say that there were fireworks at the Coliseum earlier?
Simon:
Huh? What about them?
Edgeworth:
Were those fireworks set off during the day?
Simon:
Yeah! Even just while we were there, a bunch of them were set off!
Kay:
What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
That explosion sound we heard at the end of the kidnapper's phone call... ...could very well have been the fireworks.
Kay:
Ah!
Edgeworth:
Don't think you can get away with this.
???:
Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that.
*BOOM*
Edgeworth:
For the sound to have been picked up by the phone, it must have been fairly loud.
Kay:
So that means, the culprit was near the Coliseum (Near the Coliseum - The sound of fireworks means the kidnapper was near the Sunshine Coliseum.)! Even so... I bet the fireworks could be heard in lots of places around the Coliseum.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It would be impossible for us to search the entire area by ourselves. (If only we could have the police lend us a hand...)
"Which garbage dump?" and "Near the Coliseum"
Leads to:
"Based on the explosion sound we heard from the kidnapper's phone..."
Nicole Swift
Present
Nicole's Tape Recorder
Nicole:
Mr. Edgeworth. Is my tape helpin' ya out at all?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... At present, I still cannot say whether it has been helpful or not.
Nicole:
If it don't help ya out, I'm gonna hear it from my mentor again.
Kay:
Umm, Nicole. This might be a silly question, but... ...isn't this like eavesdropping on the person who was eavesdropping on us? Can that really be considered a good thing?
Nicole:
Aah... That's why I can't stand amateurs. It's scoop or starve! If I'm too worried 'bout gettin' my hands a bit dirty... ...I wouldn't be able to survive in this jungle of journalism! Like a wild beast that feeds on the grass, I feed on my scoops!
Edgeworth:
...Aren't grass eaters the ones who are being hunted?
Kay:
If ya think of Ms. Hart as a carnivore who goes after Nicole's scoops, it makes perfect sense!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. I'm starting to feel sorry for Ms. Swift...)
Simon Keyes
Simon:
As expected of Mr. Edgeworth! How did you find him?
Kay:
Naturally, it was all thanks to his powers of logic and reasoning!
Edgeworth:
(Actually, it was just a coincidence.)
Search for Sebastian
Simon:
I guess we weren't any help at all, were we?
Kay:
Don't be silly! Of course you helped! Really, thanks a lot! Where were you guys searching, Simon?
Simon:
It was a bit far off, but we searched around the Sunshine Coliseum.
Edgeworth:
(The Sunshine Coliseum, so they were by the shore...)
Simon:
There were a lot of people at the event there, so I thought he might've gone as well.
Kay:
An event? Sounds like fun! Is it a festival? I wanna go too!
Simon:
It was a lot of fun! There were food stands, fireworks, and much more!
Regina:
Simon got worn out by all the people in the crowd pretty quickly though.
Simon:
You didn't have to tell them thaaaaat!
Kay:
It's settled! Once we wrap up this case, let's all go there! (Event at the Coliseum - There are food stands and fireworks at the Sunshine Coliseum.)
The circus show
Simon:
At any rate, I'm glad you were able to find him so quickly.
Edgeworth:
...Why is that?
Simon:
The truth is, our circus show is about to start soon. So, I don't think we would've been able to help out with the search much longer.
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Sorry to burden you with this when you also needed to prepare for your performance. I'm so relieved you were able to find him, Mr. Edgeworth!
Kay:
Yeah, but the warden still hasn't been declared guilty yet!
Simon:
WHAAAAAAAAAT!? So you're saying there's still a chance I might be arrested!? Nowaynowaynowaynoway!
Edgeworth:
Kay, please don't tease him.
Present
Yatagarasu's Badge
Simon:
H-Huh...? Didn't you also have a badge when we last met?
Edgeworth:
Yes. However, due to certain circumstances, I don't have my prosecutor's badge with me now. So, that's why..... Hm?
Simon:
........
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes, are you listening to me?
Simon:
Ulp... E-Eek! Nowaynoway! Don't eat me! I taste terrible!
Kay:
The sheer terror brought on by Mr. Edgeworth's icy glare... ...seems to have Simon totally petrified. Like a frog caught in the gaze of a hungry snake!
Edgeworth:
(I don't recall doing my glaring at all...)
Grand Tower
Simon:
The Grand Tower, huh? Isn't there a viewing platform on the roof or something?
Edgeworth:
That's correct. It would have been nice if we were here purely for sightseeing.
Kay:
Hey, Simon. What if I strung a rope from the viewing platform to one of the other buildings... ...and then you walked across without a safety harness! I'd love to see a trick like that!
Simon:
Nowaynowaynoway! No way I'm gonna do something like that!
Kay:
...Aww, that's too bad. If you could do that, you'd be able to sneak into any building you wanted around here...
Edgeworth:
Kay, quit trying to drag others down your path of thievery.
Kay:
Hmm... How about this, Simon? What if we were to give you a safety harness?
Edgeworth:
(Hmph. She's hopeless...)
Simon:
Nowaynowaynoway! Even with a safety harness, if I fell from this high up... ...I'd be stuck doing a trapeze act with the harness!
Edgeworth:
(He's hopeless as well...)
Knightley's Mementos
Simon:
Th-That's...Knightley's, isn't it...?
Kay:
...Seems like it brought back memories of Mr. Knightley for Simon.
Edgeworth:
(Indeed... Perhaps it would have been better if I didn't show this to him...)
Simon:
Don't worry, Mr. Edgeworth. I'll be fine. I've trained diligently under the boss in order to become a full-fledged animal tamer... That's what I've decided.
Kay:
But Simon, if that missing evidence isn't found, you'll be out of luck.
Simon:
U-Uuugh... Eeeeek!
Edgeworth:
(Kay... Did you really have to bring that up right now?)
Anything else
Simon:
Even if you show me stuff like that, it's too technical for me. ...I-I don't get it at all.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I guess you don't have any new information about it?
Simon:
S-S-S-S-Sorry! Am I going to be arrested? If I start spouting some random nonsense now, will I be able to plead insanity later?
Edgeworth:
...If you want to be guilty of perjury, go right ahead.
Simon:
Th-That was a leading question! I knew it! I'm going to be arrested!
Edgeworth:
(Good grief. He's not listening to me at all.)
Regina Berry
Regina:
Even though Regina also searched with her friends... Aww... We were beaten to the punch!
Edgeworth:
(By "friends", does she mean... her animals?)
Berry Big Circus
Edgeworth:
If I recall correctly, wasn't the Berry Big Circus supposed to have a performance today?
Regina:
Yup, that's right! We've all been practicing a lot for this upcoming performance!
Edgeworth:
Will Simon also be performing?
Regina:
Of course! He's been practicing really hard, even though he keeps saying "nowaynoway!" He even rode in a balloon and did lots of advertising for us! So Mr. Edgeworth, you should also come by and see Simon's heroics!
Edgeworth:
Very well. (That is, if we're able to successfully solve this case...)
The animal friends
Edgeworth:
It sounded like you were saying you used animals in your search.
Regina:
Yup. I thought we would be able to find him if I used Regent and Astique, but... ...Simon said, "nowaynowaynoway" and stopped me. No fun!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. If Simon hadn't been there, there would probably be a mass panic right about now...)
Kay:
Simon! Why did you stop her!? It would've made the city more fun, like the circus!
Simon:
...Eeek! M-M-Mr. Edgeworth! Please forgive me!
Edgeworth:
(Why is he apologizing to me? I haven't said anything...)
Present
Yatagarasu's Badge
Regina:
What's this? It kind of looks like a bird.
Kay:
It's a three-legged crow, known as the Yatagarasu. It takes flight even in the depths of night!
Regina:
Yay! I knew it was a crow! Then, it will become good friends with Regina, right? We could do a show where I grab onto its legs and we'll fly through the air!
Kay:
Isn't it great that the Yatagarasu has three legs, Mr. Edgeworth? That way, it can carry me and Regina, and even you as well, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
No, I'll pass. (What you're suggesting is impossible to begin with.)
Kay:
Aww, fine then. Regina, what if the two of us grab onto the Yatagarasu... ...and we'll chase Mr. Edgeworth around while he's stuck on the ground!
Regina:
Yay! That would be a fabulous show!
Edgeworth:
(What you're suggesting is impossible to begin with... Please stop this nonsense.)
Monster Movie Flyer, Moozilla's Head, Moozilla Doll or Monster's Footprints
Regina:
Ah! It's the Mighty Moozilla! The scary dairy cow monster!
Edgeworth:
(Scary... diary?)
Regina:
But I think Regina and Moozilla could become good friends! I'd climb on top of its head, grab its horns, and take it for a walk!
Kay:
Ah, that sounds fun! I wanna ride it too! Mr. Edgeworth can come too. We'll all ride it together!
Edgeworth:
No, I'll pass. (What you're suggesting is impossible to begin with.)
Kay:
Aww, fine then. Regina, what if the two of us take Moozilla by the horns... ...and we'll chase Mr. Edgeworth relentlessly while he's stuck on the ground!
Regina:
Sure! Just leave it to me! Relentless, we'll be fabulously relentless!
Edgeworth:
(What you're suggesting is impossible to begin with... I'm begging you, please stop.)
Knightley's Mementos
Regina:
Simon was friends with Mr. Knightley, so... ...he must be really sad. That's why I had him interact with the animals, to help heal his wounded heart. I even thought about letting him look after Regent and Astique all by himself.
Kay:
A-All by himself...?
Edgeworth:
(O-On his own...)
Anything else
Regina:
Ah! Is this a present? Yay! I'm so happy.
Edgeworth:
No, that was not my intention...
Regina:
I'm sorry. Unless it's an animal, I can't tame it.
Edgeworth:
...That was also not my intention.
Edgeworth:
Based on the explosion sound we heard from the kidnapper's phone... ...we know that John is being confined some place in the vicinity of the Coliseum.
Kay:
One of the garbage dumps is right next to the Coliseum!
Edgeworth:
John was almost certainly taken there. In which case... the place he is being confined to must also be somewhere close by. Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
Could I ask you to search the area around this garbage dump?
Gumshoe:
.....You don't have to ask me like we're strangers, sir! It feels... so distant. ...Please just order me around like you normally do.
Edgeworth:
Are you sure, Detective? Right now I'm not a prosecutor.
Gumshoe:
Didn't I tell you, sir? Detectives don't just investigate for the sake of prosecutors!
Edgeworth:
...You have my thanks, Detective.
Investigation Complete
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. Look. It's almost time...!
Edgeworth:
Yes. It would be best if we hurry. They should also be at their limit. Detective Gumshoe, I'm counting on you!
Gumshoe:
Leave it to me, sir! This may be an unofficial investigation... ...but I'll call in all of my pals from the station to help!
Kay:
I'll help too! Stealing John back is my job, after all!
Edgeworth:
I'll be returning to the courtroom. I might be able to draw out some more time.
Kay:
Oookay! Well then! Even in the depths of... night...
Edgeworth:
Hmm. The clock just struck 2...! We have to hurry!
Gumshoe:
Yessir!
Kay:
Aaah, my introduction! ...When no other bird dares to take fliiight...
April 6, 2:16 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3
Examine evidence
Back side of Yatagarasu's Badge
Edgeworth:
There was a bug planted in here. Although I don't think there's anything inside now, I should probably check just to be sure.
Blaise:
Well, well, well. If it isn't former Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(Blaise Debeste...!)
Franziska:
Witness! Face forward! We're not done talking yet!
Blaise:
Like I said, y'see. Why exactly would I have needed to help that person out, Your Honor?
Blaise:
Y'know, it's a crying shame. Having a beautiful woman declared guilty. Honestly, it brings tears to my eyes. But y'see, there's no reason for me to go out of my way to hide evidence just to save her.
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
However, we still have the testimony of your son, Prosecutor Debeste! He testified that he handed the evidence over to you!
Blaise:
Hmm. Well, I haven't the slightest clue what he was talking about. I simply can't imagine why Sebastian would have said something like that, y'know.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
What if there is evidence that shows your connection with Warden Roland?
Blaise:
Hm? And just what do you think you're doing, "Former" Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was under the impression that you were no longer in any position to stand in court?
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! How dare you barge into my prosecutor's bench...
Edgeworth:
Franziska. I'm sorry. I need you to lend me the bench for a little while.
Franziska:
Wh-What are you saying...!?
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney! I've brought vital evidence related to this case. Your Honor, please allow me to testify!
Courtney:
........
Blaise:
Hah hah hah! She'd never allow it!
Ray:
Objection!
Ray:
Courtney-pie. Uncle Ray also asks that he be allowed to testify. There are no objections from the prosecution either, right?
Franziska:
.......... Understood. The prosecution also has no objections.
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
There's no way you can allow something like this, y'know. Such high-handed methods... ...surely are enough to warrant being held in contempt of court. Wouldn't y'say, Courtney?
Courtney:
........
Edgeworth:
(Ngh! As long as John is still in danger... ...Judge Courtney cannot rule against the warden. I must convey to her somehow that the search for her son is progressing!) Judge Courtney. I ask that you have faith in me and my assistant.
Franziska:
Now that you mention it, where exactly is she...?
Edgeworth:
She is currently out searching for the most important piece of evidence.
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
It's a waste of time. There's no such evidence. Are you stalling for time? How disgraceful.
Ray:
Objection!
Ray:
Most important piece of evidence, huh? ...Courtney-pie. I don't really know what that evidence is, but I think we should have faith in her. After all, even if she may not look like it, she's still the Great Thief Yatagarasu!
Edgeworth:
(Somehow... it seems that Mr. Shields understands.) Judge Courtney! We've already determined the general location of that evidence. It's only a matter of time before she steals the evidence back.
Courtney:
! ......I understand. Then I shall give you special permission to testify.
Edgeworth:
...Thank you, Your Honor.
Blaise:
This is ridiculous!
Courtney:
This vital evidence that you have found... Please present it to the court!
Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste and Patricia Roland are somehow connected. Allow me to present the evidence that proves it! (Which piece of evidence shows the relationship between Patricia Roland and Blaise Debeste?)
Present Report on Knightley
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This document contains a detailed report regarding the interrogation of a certain man."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste! This shows that you and Patricia Roland are...
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
It's sad, Miles. Truly sad, y'know. For you to accuse me of being a criminal by presenting evidence like that. If you're gonna present evidence, you should present something more meaningful, y'know.
Edgeworth:
Nghhhoooh! (So it wasn't this piece of evidence... A piece of evidence that connects Patricia Roland and Blaise Debeste... Do I have anything like that?)
Blaise:
What's wrong, Edgeworth? Just as I thought, you can't prove a thing, can you? And y'know why? Because Patricia Roland and I aren't connected at all.
Edgeworth:
You're wrong, Blaise Debeste! There's definitely a connection, and I shall prove it!
Leads back to:
"(The only evidence I had with me at the time was...!)"
Edgeworth:
This document contains a detailed report regarding the interrogation of a certain man.
Ray:
A certain man?
Edgeworth:
That man being the late Horace Knightley. And, the one who interrogated him was the defendant in this trial, Patricia Roland.
Ray:
! So that means, that was the interrogation where...
Edgeworth:
That's right... Patricia Roland murdered Knightley in the aftermath of the interrogation. And that very interrogation has been recorded in this written report!
Courtney:
That... definitely sounds like vital evidence!
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth. Just now, you referred to that document as a "written report". Now, just who in the world was that report written for?
Edgeworth:
I thought you might ask that, Franziska. And that's precisely what is most important about this report...! We found this document inside the safe in the storeroom on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower.
Franziska:
The 51st floor... The storeroom for the black market auction!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. And the Conductor of the auction was you, Blaise Debeste!
Blaise:
............
Edgeworth:
You received a report about the victim from Warden Roland! In the face of this evidence, can you still say you have no connection to this case?
Blaise:
......In regards to that, I refuse to answer.
Edgeworth:
What?
Blaise:
It has yet to be proven in court that I was the Conductor of the black market auction.
Edgeworth:
Oh? Have you already forgotten the events of this morning? I believe I had already proved it back then, did I not?
Blaise:
I will not deny that I was bested by you. However, that was at the crime scene. Who knows if the results will be the same in court. An acquittal is still possible, y'see. ...Until it's been proven in court that I am the Conductor of the black market auctions... ...you can't prove that document was addressed to me.
Edgeworth:
Your logic is twisted...!
Blaise:
That's not very nice, y'know. My logic isn't twisted, is it? Courtney? Don't you feel the same way? It was quite unlike you to allow Former Prosecutor Edgeworth's statement just now, y'know. ...It saddens me, y'see. That you would fail to uphold the law as a judge should. In fact, I'm so upset by this, I may have no other choice but to use my last resort, y'know.
Courtney:
.....I-It is as you say. Something that has not been proven in court does not merit any deliberation. I will have to... overrule... Mr. Edgeworth's claim.
Edgeworth:
(Ngh... As I thought, until John has been rescued...)
Blaise:
Y'see? The truth at the scene and the truth in the courtroom are two very different things.
Edgeworth:
So, you're saying the truth can be distorted in court, as long as it's for your sake?
Blaise:
What a horrible thing to say. I'm not distorting the truth or anything like that, y'know. If a not guilty verdict is handed down, then that becomes the truth. That's all it is, y'see.
Edgeworth:
(It's useless. There's nothing we can do useless the missing evidence turns up...)
Blaise:
Now then, Courtney. Why don't you deliver a Not Guilty verdict and let's get this over with? After all, that evidence... isn't gonna show up any time soon, y'know.
???:
Objection!
Courtney:
Wh-Who raised an objection just now?
Debeste:
...P-Pops...
Blaise:
.....Sebastian.
Debeste:
......Uugh.
Blaise:
Why did you come back here, now of all times?
Courtney:
Sebastian! What is the meaning of this?
Franziska:
Just where were you and what have been doing since you abandoned your own trial?
Debeste:
I-I'm sorry. I was... umm...
Franziska:
Such an act is unbecoming of a prosecutor! You should be ashamed!
Debeste:
I... umm... well...
Blaise:
Sebastian. You still don't get it, y'know. This court has no place for sniveling child such as yourself!
Debeste:
.....Pops.....! I...... I...! I-I've come to present new evidence, Your Honor! So, so... please! Let me take my place back at the prosecutor's bench!
Edgeworth:
(Sebastian...! I didn't think he would come back...)
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
Hah hah hah hah! What's all this now, Sebastian? You don't seem at all like your normal self!
Debeste:
........Uugh. Pops...
Blaise:
Hm? Come now! What's the matter? You want Daddy to play with you? Is that it? Well then, why don't we just head on back home.
Debeste:
R-Return to the witness stand.
Blaise:
What's wrong? You're shaking like a leaf.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! The prosecutor officially in charge of this case has just arrived with new evidence. The trial is still in session. In light of this, shouldn't we continue with the proceedings?
Courtney:
........
Ray:
Naturally, the defense has no objections, Your Honor. I'm sure the defense attorney originally in charge would say the same.
Franziska:
.....The prosecution has no objections, either, Your Honor.
Courtney:
..........
Blaise:
Continue with the proceedings? That won't be necessary. Isn't that right? Courtney.
Edgeworth:
(Blaise still believes that he was the one who kidnapped John. As long as John still hasn't been found... ...Judge Courtney will remain bound by Blaise, and nothing else will change that!)
Courtney:
.......... Th-That sound is...
Edgeworth:
(Her cell phone...!) Hm...! (My phone as well...?)
Ray:
Eh? Uncle Ray's phone is also...!
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Kay:
Mr. Shields!
Gumshoe:
We've found John, sir!
Kay:
We rescued John!
Edgeworth:
Excellent work, Detective!
Ray:
That kid was the most important piece of evidence, right? Way to go, Kay!
Kay:
Eheheh! I wanted to spread the word quickly, so I had everyone call!
Edgeworth:
.....Judge Courtney. It's for you.
Courtney:
.....
Courtney:
.......Yes. I see. I'm..... I'm so glad you're safe...! Make sure you properly thank everyone. OK? ............Be careful, and come home safe.
Courtney:
...Let us resume the proceedings. Now that I may once again swing my gabel to my heart's content.
Blaise:
Hah...! You're kidding, right? This is just a sad joke, y'know!
Courtney:
Witness! This is no joke! Please return to the stand! Prosecutor Debeste, as well. Promptly return to your seat at the prosecutor's bench!
Debeste:
Y-Yes, Your Honor!
Franziska:
........Sebastian Debeste.
Debeste:
Y-Yes, Ms. von Karma...!?
Franziska:
.....I leave the rest to you.
Debeste:
Huh...?
Franziska:
"Going up against your own father..." It won't be easy. I shall observe how things pan out... from the gallery.
Courtney:
Now then, allow me to ask once more... Is the prosecution ready? Prosecutor Debeste. What is this new evidence you wish to present...?
Debeste:
.....The missing knife and chisel, Your Honor.
Ray:
You mean they've finally been found!?
Courtney:
Prosecutor Debeste! Is this true!?
Debeste:
...Th-The knife and chisel... I wasn't able to find them... I searched and searched! I really did! But... it was already too late...
Edgeworth:
(Too late...?)
Ray:
What do you mean?
Debeste:
I remembered... This morning, when I passed by Pops in the garage at home... ...he was holding something wrapped in a newspaper.
Debeste:
Pops, where are you going?
Blaise:
Ah, Sebastian. Just taking out some trash.
Debeste:
At that moment, I heard it. .....The faint sound of a bell.
Ray:
Could that sound have been, by any chance...
Edgeworth:
...the bell attached to Dogen's chisel!?
Courtney:
In other words... you're saying that the witness threw away the evidence?
Blaise:
........
Debeste:
I searched for it, but I didn't make it in time. I'm sorry...
Ray:
Where exactly did you search for it?
Debeste:
The garbage dump! I went to the garbage dump and searched everywhere! I thought the evidence Pops threw away had to be there...!
Edgeworth:
Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?)
Kay:
Ah! What're you doing here?
Debeste:
WHOOOOOOOAAAHH!
Kay:
H-He ignored us...
Edgeworth:
(So at that time, he had gone to the garbage dump...)
Debeste:
But... but... ...this was all I could find.
Courtney:
This is...? It smells rather peculiar...
Ray:
Now that you mention it, there's kind of a funky smell coming from you as well...
Debeste:
Wh-What do you expect!? I was digging through garbage!
Edgeworth:
And what of the knife?
Debeste:
I think it's buried somewhere in that giant mountain of trash... ...but I couldn't find it by myself.
Courtney:
...I understand. I shall accept this into evidence.
Blaise:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well done, Sebastian! You never betray my expectations, y'know! You searched so desperately through the garbage and that's all you have to show for it?
Debeste:
Urk...!
Blaise:
Awww, what a tear-jerker! I'm tearing up already!
Ray:
Objection!
Ray:
It's a bit too early for tears, don't you think? We haven't examined the evidence properly yet.
Blaise:
...I think it's just a pointless waste of time, y'know.
Ray:
I'm counting on you. Sebastian, Miles. Show him that the truth can be exposed in court and take him down!
Edgeworth:
(Mr. Shields is backing us up. Now all we need is a breakthrough...!) Prosecutor Debeste. Let's take a closer look at the evidence.
Debeste:
R... Right!
Examine rolled up paper
Leads to:
"Let's have a look inside. (It'd be great if we could find some kind of proof.)"
Edgeworth:
Let's have a look inside. (It'd be great if we could find some kind of proof.) This is... the bell that was attached to Dogen's chisel... Are there any traces left behind on it?
Debeste:
.....Ack, it's no good. There's not even a single smudge on it...
Courtney:
What did you find, Prosecutor Debeste!?
Blaise:
Did you even find anything?
Debeste:
D... Darn it...
Blaise:
Of course you'd find nothing. Something like that can't be called evidence, y'know. All it is, is trash. It may be sad, but that's the truth, y'see.
Edgeworth:
(Were Sebastian's efforts all for naught...?) Indeed, this bell does not seem to be valid evidence... (However...)
Debeste:
Mr. Edgeworth! Are you really giving up!?
Blaise:
Calm as always, Edgeworth. Quite unlike Sebastian here!
Courtney:
...Well then, is the prosecution finished with its argument?
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
Justine, not yet! We're not through yet! There's still something we haven't examined!
Blaise:
You're still not giving up? Struggling in vain's not cute at all, y'know.
Edgeworth:
(It seems Sebastian hasn't given up yet either. I was just thinking the exact same thing. The last item remaining... Is it trash, or is it evidence...? If we don't examine it, we'll never find out... The item I'm thinking of is...)
The knife
Edgeworth:
The knife is the last piece of evidence we need!
Debeste:
What are you talking about, Mr. Edgeworth!? Didn't I tell you that I didn't find the knife!? Do you enjoy torturing me like this?
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (That's not what I...)
Blaise:
Struggling in vain's not good, y'know. Can't you see there's nothing at all?
Edgeworth:
(The last piece of evidence... There might be something remaining there. There's no other option. We must examine that item.)
Leads back to:
"(The item I'm thinking of is...)"
The bell
Edgeworth:
The bell itself is the final piece of evidence!
Debeste:
What are you talking about, Mr. Edgeworth!? I thought we didn't find anything on the bell!
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (That's right...)
Blaise:
Struggling in vain's not good, y'know. Can't you see there's nothing at all?
Edgeworth:
(The last piece of evidence... There might be something remaining there. There's no other option. We must examine that item.)
Leads back to:
"(The item I'm thinking of is...)"
The newspaper
Leads to:
"We're still not done examining the newspaper that the bell was wrapped in!"
Debeste:
We're still not done examining the newspaper that the bell was wrapped in!
Edgeworth:
(It seems that Sebastian has the same idea as I do.)
Blaise:
Wow, this is just wonderful, y'know. So wonderful, it's to cry for. Is it desperation, or simply reckless abandon? Are you really going to... pin all your hopes on a worthless scrap of newspaper?
Edgeworth:
Heh. We won't know for sure whether or not it's "worthless" until we examine it, will we? Sebastian. Let's examine it posthaste.
Examine bell
Edgeworth:
This is Dogen's bell... There isn't a single stain on it.
Debeste:
We probably won't find anything on the bell! Let's try examining the newspaper!
Edgeworth:
Indeed.
Examine handprint on back
Leads to:
"Is this... a handprint?"
Edgeworth:
Is this... a handprint?
Debeste:
! There's something greasy on here too... Is it oil?
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney! We'd like to request a fingerprint analysis on this paper! Could you please summon someone from forensics?
Courtney:
Your request is accepted. Contact the lab at once!
Forensics:
Reporting! These are definitely fingerprints! However... it's from a glove!
Debeste:
Wh-Whaaaaaaat!?
Blaise:
Didn't I tell you? It's nothing but a worthless scrap of paper. Just thinking about it, y'know. When handling important evidence... ...what kind of idiot wouldn't use gloves!? Oh wait, wouldn't that be you? The idiot who doesn't know when to give up.
Ray:
...That's pretty harsh, talking to your son like that.
Blaise:
What's wrong with calling an idiot an idiot? If you want to be The Best, you have to be heartless. I have no compassion worthless individuals, not even my own son!
Debeste:
Pops...! I.....!
Blaise:
Y'know, you've always called yourself a genius prosecutor, haven't you? Didn't I explain to you this morning why you were a genius up until now? That's right. It was all because of me. Because of my authority. You were always being protected. By people like Courtney... and me.
Debeste:
........Uuunghh.
Blaise:
Now, get that stinking face of yours out of my sight.
Debeste:
Stinking...
Blaise:
Y'know, now that I think about it, that stench might just suit you perfectly. Just keep it away from my nose, or my eyes will start watering.
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
Wrong... You're wrong, Pops.
Blaise:
...Sebastian? What are you talking about?
Debeste:
...You're the one who stinks, Pops. It's you, not me!
Blaise:
What...?
Debeste:
...You haven't noticed, have you? You smell, Pops. So much that you can't even hide it. Mr. Edgeworth... Try smelling the hand print on the newspaper.
Edgeworth:
The smell...? ...Hmm. It smells... like oil...
Debeste:
I know something that smells just like it...
Edgeworth:
(Come to think of it, back then...)
Edgeworth:
(It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.)
Debeste:
That's right... The smell proves it. It proves that the culprit who hid the evidence was...! It's no good... I guess I can't become the best after all. I'm too soft... I could never be so heartless... ...I just can't bring down my father with my own hands.
Edgeworth:
(Prosecutor Debeste...) ..........Summon... your courage. "Become a different prosecutor from your father"... Wasn't that what you decided?
Debeste:
!
Edgeworth:
We are prosecutors. And as prosecutors, we stand in the courtroom. In that case, isn't it our duty to shed light on the truth?
Debeste:
........
Edgeworth:
Exposing crimes and bringing criminals to justice. Even if the criminal is your own father... ...that is your duty, as a prosecutor. Didn't I promise you? That if you have the courage to stand up... I will show you the way. And if you cannot do it alone, then we shall do it together...
Debeste:
...Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Allow me to present the evidence that connects this hand print with my father!
Present Mechanic's Gloves
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is the smell of motor oil. The kind used for maintaining motorcycles..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Debeste:
Doesn't this piece of evidence kind of resemble the hand print on the newspaper?
Blaise:
.......
Edgeworth:
Hmph. It seems he has nothing to say.
Blaise:
Yup, I've nothing to say. Because they don't look anything alike at all...
Edgeworth:
Nngh! (It seems this wasn't it...)
Blaise:
Ah ha ha ha! That's just like you, Sebastian. Y'know, about that evidence. Can you really say that it has any connection with me at all?
Edgeworth:
Indeed, it would be meaningless if just the shape was the same.
Debeste:
Let's take another look at the evidence we have!
Edgeworth:
Prosecutor Debeste. Fulfill your duty as a prosecutor.
Leads back to:
"And if you cannot do it alone, then we shall do it together..."
Edgeworth:
This is the smell of motor oil. The kind used for maintaining motorcycles...
Debeste:
Both myself and Mr. Edgeworth have smelled this exact same smell before!
Edgeworth:
Blaise Debeste! It was in your garage!
Blaise:
!
Edgeworth:
And wouldn't you say these fingerprints have a rather peculiar shape? The five letters that spell out D-E-A-T-H. It's exactly the same as your own gloves.
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
Ha ha ha! You can buy gloves like that from anywhere! It doesn't prove a thing!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Is that really the case?
Debeste:
That's not the only thing that these two pieces of evidence have in common!
Edgeworth:
(The fingerprints on the newspaper that was used to wrap up the bell... ...and Blaise's mechanic's gloves...) This is the unmistakable similarity they both share!
Present faded "A" letter
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"If you examine the imprint left by the letter A, you'll see it's unmistakably from this glove."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is the unmistakable similarity that these two pieces of evidence share!
Blaise:
Hmm... I'm not quite sure where this unmistakable similarity is, y'know.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Even if you don't understand, I do.
Debeste:
But Mr. Edgeworth, I don't understand either!
Edgeworth:
Nngh! (So that wasn't it...)
Debeste:
Mr. Edgeworth. Let's look closely at the fingerprints on the newspaper again! It should definitely have a similarity with the glove!
Blaise:
Hmph. As I thought, that glove isn't evidence at all.
Edgeworth:
Is that really the case? That's not the only similarity.
Leads back to:
"This is the unmistakable similarity they both share!"
Edgeworth:
If you examine the imprint left by the letter A, you'll see it's unmistakably from this glove.
Blaise:
Whaaaaaaaaat!?
Edgeworth:
And that's not all... There is one more item we must take note of. Namely, these dirt stains. I suggest we do a comparative analysis of the dirt stains from the newspaper and the glove. If the contents match up... then it will prove to be decisive evidence.
Courtney:
Bailiff! Please have these dirt samples sent to forensics for analysis immediately!
Blaise:
Gaaaaaaaarrgh! Edgewooorth! Sebastiaaaan! You lowly prosecutors! Do you have any idea who I am!?
Debeste:
Pops... you can't run away anymore. It's been proven in court that you concealed the evidence. And that you tried to cover for the defendant...
Blaise:
Y-You're saying that I'm... Guilty? That I'll be sent to prison...? Me, Blaise Debeste? A couple of snot-nosed punks are gonna make me disappear!? There must be some mistake!
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
Be a man and admit your crimes!
Blaise:
Objection!
Blaise:
Do you really think you can survive if I'm not around?
Debeste:
I..... I'll be fine now. I thought I wanted to be the best prosecutor, so I could get your approval, Pops. But, when I was kidnapped by your men... and stuck in that dark room, I started thinking. "I am... truly powerless." I despaired, and averted my eyes from the truth. But... ...at that moment, Mr. Edgeworth stepped in and showed me the way. And now, I am no longer just a child chasing after his father's approval! I've become capable... I can find evidence on my own now!
Blaise:
Wha... My men kidnapped you? Why were you...!?
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
Pops, I'll show you the truth you never knew... through this trial.
Blaise:
Sebastiaaan! How dare you speak to me like that...! You should've just stayed as an idiot son!
Debeste:
You may have hated me to the very end, Pops... ...but I... I've always looked up to you. Thank you for everything up until now. .....And goodbye.
Blaise:
You... Since when did you... All you've ever been able to do was depend on me! SebaSTIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN!
Courtney:
It has been established that the evidence was concealed by Blaise Debeste himself. A judgment regarding his concealment of evidence shall be delivered at a separate trial. The missing chisel and knife still have yet to be found. However, once a search of the waste disposal site is underway, they will surely be discovered.
Roland:
...The knife will be found? Wh-What will happen to me if it's found?
Edgeworth:
Heh. No need to worry. You'll simply receive the punishment you deserve for your crime.
Roland:
Grrrr! Punishment? For me!? Blaise, what in the world are you doing!? You! You... After all your boasting about being able to create your own truths and Not Guilty verdicts! That's why I contacted you immediately after the prison incident in the first place! And to make matters worse, you even kidnapped the wrong kid! I just can't believe this! You really, really, really are... completely useleeeeeessss!
Edgeworth:
...That was certainly a violent outburst. But you heard her, Prosecutor Debeste.
Debeste:
Yeah. She got flustered and said a bunch of important stuff! ...Right?
Edgeworth:
Indeed... That's correct. (He still doesn't seem very sure of himself...)
Courtney:
Very well. And with that, this court is adjourned.
???:
Not so fast!!
Edgeworth:
What?
Franziska:
Huh!?
Courtney:
Wh-Who are you?
Lang:
Judge Courtney. It's still too early for a happy ending. Lang Zi says: "The end of the trial is not always the end of the case."
Courtney:
And who... might you be?
Lang:
The name's Shi-Long Lang. I'm just a humble, lone investigator.
Courtney:
Do you have some objection with this trial?
Lang:
Hah! Not a chance! The defendant there has a heart as black as a moonless night.
Roland:
Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...?
Lang:
You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree?
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. What are you talking about?
Lang:
The SS-5 Incident from 12 years ago... It's a case I'll never forget.
Edgeworth:
(12 years ago...?)
Lang:
......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa.
Edgeworth:
(12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?)
Edgeworth:
(Might it have something to do with Lang's father and President Huang?)
Lang:
Patricia Roland. And you, Blaise Debeste. Back then, the two of you killed off the Lang clan...
Roland:
Rrgh...
Courtney:
Were you involved in the incident 12 years ago?
Lang:
That's right, I was. However... I'm not here to chase after ghosts of the past. I'm here for you, Justine Courtney...!
Courtney:
M... Me?
Lang:
You, and one other...
John:
..........
Courtney:
John!
Lang:
Ms. Courtney! You're coming along too! As a suspect in the murder of the president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang! What evidence do you...!?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Settle down, Mr. Prosecutor. The investigation has only just begun. We're going to inspect the crime scene with the suspects in attendance.
Edgeworth:
(Agent Lang... did he get his hands on some new pieces of evidence?)
Lang:
If you have any objections, then you can tag along as well.
Edgeworth:
...I shall do just that.
John:
........
Edgeworth:
("The end of the trial is not always the end of the case"... There are still many mysteries yet unsolved surrounding the murder of the president... Namely, the true nature of the "giant monster", and...)
???:
Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that.
Edgeworth:
(The true identity of the person on the other end of the phone...)
To be continued.
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right... I need to reconsider the information.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information. I need to think this over one more time.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, that statement contradicts this piece of evidence!
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor, are you playing games with me?
Edgeworth:
The evidence says it all.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
In that case, the evidence is lying through its teeth!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (So that wasn't it...)
Kay:
Even if you defang him, he's still a wolf! As expected, he's tough.
Edgeworth:
Yes. He's a worthy opponent indeed.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. Please take a look at this piece of evidence.
Lang:
Hah! Just what are you trying to say with that evidence!?
Edgeworth:
If you don't even know after looking at it, you certainly have fallen to a new low.
Lang:
Brazenly shoving such a meaningless thing into my face... Aren't you the one who has fallen to a new low here!?
Edgeworth:
Urgh! (So it wasn't this piece of evidence...)
Kay:
What are you doing!? You realize who you're up against, right!? If you're not careful, you're gonna get bitten!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. I'd better be wary of those fangs.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, it seems there is a clear contradiction in your statement.
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "Always question words without evidence!" Hah! But it seems I don't even need to question the words that you're saying. It's clearly a pathetic bluff!
Edgeworth:
Argh! (So that was wrong?)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! A bluff won't be effective against Mr. Lang!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. In that case, I'll have to face him head-on!
Too many penalties
Edgeworth:
Ngh! To come this far, only to lose the truth...! But... it seems there's nothing I can do now...
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Time's up (in Logic Chess, Justine Courtney)
Courtney:
Any more of this would be a waste of time. I have nothing left to say to you.
Edgeworth:
C-Confound it...!
Edgeworth:
I can't give up now. I have to stand my ground... Now... let's try this again!
Time's up (in Logic Chess, Sebastian Debeste)
Debeste:
Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!
Edgeworth:
C-Confound it...!
Edgeworth:
I can't give up now. I have to stand my ground... Now... Let's try this again!
Nothing to Examine
Edgeworth:
There's nothing of interest here.
