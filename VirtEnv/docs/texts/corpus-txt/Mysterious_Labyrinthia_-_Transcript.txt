Chapter 1Mysterious Labyrinthia
???:
............ ...Luke... Wake up, my boy.
Horse-Drawn Wagon
Luke:
Uh, umm... Eh? Professor?
Layton:
Good. I'm glad to see you're awake.
Luke:
Ugh...yeah. Glad to be back...
Layton:
Are you feeling all right?
Luke:
Um, yeah, I'm fine. A bit drowsy though... I guess I just fell asleep all of a sudden. ............Ah! Wait, now I remember! Professor, what happened with the witches?! And...where exactly are we?!
Layton:
Well, Luke, I've only just woken up myself. We've been here in this horse-drawn wagon since I awoke.
Luke:
H-how did we end up asleep in a wagon?!
Layton:
That is something we must now find out. First of all, where are we? And secondly, where are we being taken? There's another passenger over there. Let's start by asking her.
Luke:
Good thinking, Professor!
Examine
Sack on right
You found a hint coin!
Crate on wagon floor
You found a hint coin!
Lantern hanging from wagon tarp
You found a hint coin!
Hooded figure
Leads to:
"Excuse me, but I wonder if you could tell us where this wagon is heading?"
Vegetable basket
Luke:
Vegetables. They're all quite big and tasty looking.
Layton:
Perhaps it is a vegetable cart? No, I don't think it is.
Luke:
We're not in London any more, are we...?
Wagon seat on right
Luke:
It looks pretty drab. If this is a sightseeing tour wagon, the tickets had better be cheap.
Layton:
It is not the most comfortable, either.
Luke:
There's one more passenger, so I think it's not a freight wagon, at least.
Window on right
Layton:
Judging from what I can see, we're crossing a forest.
Luke:
A forest? This can't be London. Where on earth are we?
Layton:
There is not a trace of other people or even cars. We must be somewhere deep in the countryside.
Layton:
Excuse me, but I wonder if you could tell us where this wagon is heading?
???:
Where it's heading? ...That really is a meaningless question. It goes without saying, since there's only one place we could possibly be heading.
Layton:
...I'm not sure I entirely follow.
Luke:
Um... What do you mean by "one place"?
???:
............ If you really want to know, why don't you ask the wagon driver? Although, whether you ask or not, we'll be arriving at our destination soon anyway.
Luke:
If that's the case, surely it wouldn't hurt to just tell us...
Layton:
Luke... Let's take her advice. We may have better luck with the driver.
Luke:
All right...if you say so.
???:

Wagon driver
Leads to:
"Hee-hee, so you finally woke up, did you?"
Wagon Driver:
Hee-hee, so you finally woke up, did you? I was wondering what to do with you both... I was starting to think you'd never wake up.
Luke:
E-excuse me, but... where is it that we're going?
Wagon Driver:
Me-oh-my! You didn't get into this wagon without knowing where it's headed, did you?
Layton:
Well, in truth, we only just became aware that we were in here. Until just a moment ago, we were at Tower Bridge, in London. I'm afraid we have no recollection of having boarded this wagon.
Wagon Driver:
Hee-hee, you certainly say the strangest things. You're both still half asleep, aren't you?
Luke:
Half asleep...? Of course not!
Wagon Driver:
As far as I remember, you've both been in this wagon from the very start.
Luke:
There's no way that's right! And besides...
Wagon Driver:
Now, now, don't get so worked up, sonny. You'll upset the other passengers. I know nothing about the two of you, except from what I've seen. My job is just to carry my passengers... ...to that town.
Layton:
A town, you say...?
Wagon Driver:
Well looky here, it's just come into sight! Why not take a peek out, hmm?
Layton:

Main Street
Knight:
Captain! All present and accounted for, sir!
Captain:
Ahem! I want you to keep it in mind, men, that the peace of this town is in your hands. Never forget that no matter what happens, the people look to you to keep the peace! We proud knights of the order will always protect the people!
Knight:
Yes, sir! For honour and glory!
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Captain, Captain!
Captain:
Hmm...? What can I do for you, my little ones?
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
I want to join the order of knights and patrol the streets like you!
Captain:
Ha ha! That's an upstanding ambition, lad. Perhaps, when you're a little bigger...
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Yes, sir! I'll do my very best to grow up as soon as I can, sir!
Captain:
Hmm. I like your spirit, young man! Be seeing you.
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
Oh, you look so pleased with yourself! You don't really think a weakling like you could join the order of knights, do you?
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Hey, that's not a nice thing to say. Every boy wants to be a knight...
Bardly:
Oh, what can he do, For one sweet as you? This bardly bard called Bardly♪
Muffet:
Could you sing me a wittle song? Something womantic, to melt my heart?
Bardly:
Oh, fair maiden, the pleasure is mine. A worthy song, for a love such as thine♪ Oh, the love in your heart, And the love in your head, Is full and warm, like freshly baked bread♪
Muffet:
...Sweeeeet!
Luke:
P-Professor! Look at those people over there! They're all wearing period costumes. I've never seen that in London!
Layton:
Hmm...you're right, Luke. This town would appear to resemble the one we saw pictured in that book... Although I'm somewhat puzzled as to how we have ended up here...
???:
There is nothing strange about any of this...
Layton:
............!
Luke:
Ah! You're the passenger from the wagon.
???:
The fact that we are here now is a predetermined turn of events.
Luke:
Wh-what do you mean?! We were just brought here from outside...
???:
This "outside" of which you speak... Just what exactly are you referring to?
Luke:
Huh? Well, I mean London, of course...
???:
There is no such place. Nor is there any such thing as an "outside". Not here...not in Labyrinthia...
Layton:
............! Labyrinthia...
Luke:
Wh-what?! You mean this is really Labyrinthia? Even so, that doesn't mean that London doesn't exist! If we went back the way we came, we'd be bound to come across it eventually!
???:
If you don't believe me, then why don't you take a look with your own eyes?
Luke:
Ahh?! Professor! The gate is gone!
Layton:
............?!
Luke:
The gate we came through was right behind us, wasn't it?
Layton:
Hmm...yes, it certainly was there.
Luke:
So if that's the case, why does no one around here seem surprised? Seeing such a big gate disappear like that...
H-hey...where did she go?
Layton:
This is most perplexing...
Luke:
What's going on here...?
Layton:
If this really is Labyrinthia, then... Could it be that we have somehow ended up inside that book...?
Luke:
You mean the book Espella was showing us, don't you? The Historia Labyrinthia...
Layton:
That's right, Luke. Do you recall what happened to us at Tower Bridge?
Luke:
Well, I remember when that book started glowing. But after that, I'm totally blank...
Layton:
............
Luke:
Professor...you don't think we've somehow been pulled inside that book, do you?
Layton:
It's a bit early to be drawing conclusions just yet, my boy. There are quite a few people around here. Let's start off by asking a few questions.
Examine
Knight captain
Leads to:
"You've finished patrolling this area, then?"
Labyrinthian flag at top left
Layton:
The flag bears some coat of arms, it seems.
Luke:
Knights, coat of arms... This really seems like the past...
Produce vendor
Luke:
Look at all this fresh produce, Professor!
Layton:
It seems people here do not need to rely on barter. They have their own currency.
Gear vendor
Luke:
They're selling various equipment. Swords and shields are lined up on the display counter.
Layton:
The variety of items on display suggests these people's civilisation is quite advanced.
Captain:
You've finished patrolling this area, then?
Knight:
Yes, sir! Nothing to report at present, sir!
Captain:
Hmm, we must be even more on our guard than usual today.
Knight:
Yes, sir! Oh, by the way, Captain...
Captain:
Yes?
Knight:
I don't mean to alarm you, but there appears to be a couple of unusual characters approaching our vicinity, sir!
Captain:
What?! Oi there, you two! What business do you have with the order of knights?
Luke:
Oh, er...well, um...we just wanted to ask a few questions about the area... Um, about the order of knights... Are you really...real knights?
Captain:
What's that?! You're not poking fun at the order of knights, are you?!
Layton:
That was certainly not our intention. We were merely noting that your appearance is somewhat unusual...
Captain:
You're saying we're unusual, are you? Well, that's an unusual thing to say... We usually patrol Labyrinthia, doing our usual duty of keeping the usual order. Tell me, what's unusual about that? If anyone's unusual here, it's you two! And I find it quite unusual that I've never seen either of you characters before. Which part of the town are you from?
Luke:
We, um...just came here in the back of a wagon, through the gate over there. But then we noticed the gate has vanished. You didn't see anything, did you?
Captain:
Gate? What gate?
Layton:
............
Luke:
But, there was a gate... We just came through it, from outside...
Captain:
...Outside? Now I've been patient with you two, but nothing you're saying makes a lick of sense.
Layton:
My apologies. I'm afraid it has been a while since we've been here on the main street. And I seem to remember there having been a gate of some sort around here...
Luke:
But, Professor...
Layton:
Luke, I think it would be prudent to play along here.
Captain:
There's definitely something fishy about you two...
Knight:
Captain, I don't suppose these two are...
Captain:
No, I doubt that. Although they do look and act strangely...
Knight:
Maybe, we could test them to see if they really do live here?
Captain:
A test... Yes, that might be a good idea. I know a good way of deciding whether you two are dubious characters or not.
Luke:
Wh-what are you going to do?
Captain:
Well, it's very simple. If you really are upstanding members of this community, then you'll be able to solve this.
Luke:
Solve? Solve what...?
Layton:
Hmm. Luke, it appears this town has puzzles similar to those of our own world.
Captain:
What are you mumbling about? Are you ready? Then here we go!

Captain:
Mmm...truly impressive puzzle solving! Of course, any member of our community could solve it... But those who can solve it with this level of insight are few and far between. You are no longer under suspicion. Although I must advise you to speak and act with more caution henceforth. Today being a special day, we are on an even higher level of alert than usual.
Luke:
It seemed a bit touch and go for a moment, but I think we've convinced him.
Layton:
Not only that, but it seems that puzzles are a familiar concept here. Which means that if we run into trouble, we should be able to overcome it through our usual puzzle-solving approach.
Luke:
That's good to know! That puzzle was a bit different to what we are used to, though...
Layton:
It seemed to be a puzzle rather unique to this town. And all the more worth solving for it, wouldn't you say, Luke?
Luke:
Too right, Professor! So what's our next step...?
Layton:
Well, my boy, first and foremost... I suggest we take a look around and investigate this town of Labyrinthia.
Luke:
All right, let's do that! But where should we start...? We know next to nothing about this town...
Layton:
That's true, Luke. Although, if you recall, we do know somebody who has been here before us.
Luke:
Ah! You mean Carmine, right?!
Layton:
Precisely. It appears that Carmine was able to leave this town and return to London. However, it would also appear that he was unaware of how me managed to do so...
Luke:
So you mean, Carmine's activities here may be our only clue to getting back?
Layton:
I'm afraid so, Luke. First things first, let's see if we can find any signs of his presence here.
Luke:
Right you are, Professor! Let's start investigating!
???:
...Hmm... ...Enjoy yourselves while you can... ...for you will no doubt soon realise... ...the role you have been chosen to play...
Examine
Cecil and Petal
Leads to:
"I haven't seen you two around here before! Do you know where you're standing?"
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
I haven't seen you two around here before! Do you know where you're standing?
Luke:
Well, I might be wrong...but I think we're in Labyrinthia...
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
That's not what I mean! You tell 'em, Cecil.
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Me? Uh, well... It's just that this is OUR territory, you see?
Luke:
Your territory...?
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
That's right. You two just went and walked right into our territory.
Luke:
Oh, I get it. You mean we walked into the area you always play in, right? Sorry, we didn't realise... Do you mind if we join you here for a while?
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
You heard 'em... Whaddya think?
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
I guess it'd be all right. The more the merrier, I say.
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
Fine, here's what we'll do. If you can solve this puzzle, then you can stick around.
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
It's our initiation test!

Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
Hey, you're pretty good.
Luke:
That was a piece of cake. After all, solving puzzles is my speciality!
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
Yeah, me too. It'd only take me ten seconds to solve a puzzle like that.
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Really? I didn't know you solved puzzles.
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
You...just keep out of this! Nobody asked you! Anyway, you're now an official member as promised. From now on, you're number two.
Luke:
Number two?
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Yep! I'm number one!
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
You should feel proud. As number two, you can walk around the town freely. Not only that, but I'll let you in on a secret. If you check those green flags over there, you'll find something I hid there.
Luke:
Um, okay, thanks! Somehow...I get the feeling that even if I hadn't become number two, I could have walked around the town freely...
A new destination has been added to the map: Town Centre.
Examine
Cecil or Petal
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
Hey, number two! There's something else you should know.
Luke:
What's that?
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
I've hidden treasure in some other places all over our territory. For example, that flag over there. Try examining it and see what you find. You'll find something amazing that I hid! There's treasure hidden in a whole lot of other places, too.
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Just help yourself to whatever you find!
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
As the boss, it's my duty to take care of my number two!
Luke:
Thanks! I'll be sure to search all around for the treasure you've hidden.
Cecil or Petal (subsequent times)
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
Make sure to check every nook and cranny!
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
It would be great if you found all of it.

Ho-hum, ho-hee! I'm just so happyyyyy!
Luke:
Why are you so happy?
Muffet:
Well, that should be obvious! Today I get to gaze upon Inquisitor Barnham in all his spwendour!
Luke:
Inquisitor Barnham? What's he like?
Muffet:
Are you sewious?! I can't bewieve there's a young boy who doesn't know all about Zack Barnham! He's so spwendid and handsome and kind... He's just amazing!
Luke:
I, um...I'm surprised anyone could be that wonderful...
Muffet:
Oh, you'll understand when you see him! He'll be making his appeawance soon, over on Nowth Pawade Avenue. Ho-hum, ho-hee, I'm just so happyyyyy! I have to go now and see what I will seeeee!
Luke:
............?
Layton:
She seems to have headed north.
Luke:
She said North Parade Avenue, didn't she? Do you think some sort of event will be taking place there?
Layton:
I can't say for certain...but wherever you look, the townspeople certainly do seem excited about something. It could be that some kind of special social event is being held today.
Luke:
Sounds exciting! Let's hurry up and see what's going on!

It is a very detailed statue portraying a knight.
Luke:
Professor, is this town ruled by knights?
Sleeping cat
Luke:
A cat! I like looking at animals almost as much as solving puzzles.
Layton:
It's asleep. I am relieved to know that even in this world cats can safely nap in the sun.
Shop billboard
Luke:
Gusts of wind are rattling the shop sign. It seems they're closed today.
Layton:
The number of shops indicates the town's prosperity.
Bardly:
Oh, what have we here? A man and a lad! Like two lost sheep, It makes me so sad...♪
Luke:
Wow, are you singing for us?
Layton:
Ah, how fascinating! This man is clearly a minstrel.
Luke:
Minstrel? There were around in the Middle Ages, weren't they?
Layton:
Indeed. In the Middle Ages, minstrels were a kind of professional musician or poet. Although I do find it a little embarrassing to be referred to as a "lost sheep"...
Luke:
Well, at least it's better than being called a little lost lamb, right, Professor?
Bardly:
Little lost lambs, please have no fear! The bard, your shepherd, Is standing right here♪ Labyrinthine town, so your ways be known, I shall give the lambs a map, Of their very own♪
Layton:
You're right, Luke...I did prefer sheep. But it is most kind of this gentleman to provide us with a map of the town.
Bardly:
It is my pleasure, it is my delight! I am only doing, what is right♪
Luke:
Thank you, minstrel! This map will come in handy.
Bardly:
The sheep are happy, the bard is pleased, But sadly that map, is a bit of a tease...♪
Luke:
Huh? What do you mean?
Bardly:
Actually... the map I just gave you... is all in pieces...
Luke:
Whaaat?!

Layton:
Please, think nothing of it. I'm just glad we have the map in one piece.
Bardly:
Now, let me tell you about our proud town! The first thing you should know, Is that it is round♪ Right is a baker, selling bread for your meal. Left is a weaponsmith, sharpening steel♪ In the north of the town, People gather and wait. And I must go soon, before it's too late♪
Luke:
There definitely seems to be something big going on to the north, Professor!
Layton:
Yes, it would appear so, Luke. Let's make sure to have a look a little later.

Captain:
Okay then, let's make some room there!
Luke:
Wow, would you look at all these people! And look over there! Those knights we saw are here too. What do you think's going to happen?
Layton:
I don't know, Luke. But whatever it is, it must be something of great importance to this town. Everyone appears to be waiting for something.

I guess this is as far as we can go. I wonder what's up ahead...

I suppose there's nothing for it. For the time being, we'll just have to look around for a little while longer.

What a day! What a day! I've been waiting so long for this day that my beard has grown this far!

Tuggit:
Without a doubt, it must be soon now.
Layton:
It would appear they have been kept waiting for quite some time.
Luke:
Everyone else here seems to be growing restless too.
Layton:
Let's come back later. It shouldn't be difficult to tell when it's getting under way.
Muffet or Tuggit (subsequent times)

Oh my, why won't it start?! I don't think my heart can take any more!

You and me both. If it doesn't start soon, my beard will grow even longer!

Luke:
It's the fishmonger. They're selling uhm...saltwater fish.
Layton:
That means this town must be close to the sea.
Bread on right
Layton:
The bakery. Labyrinthians do not seem to suffer from food shortages.
Luke:
It can't be a bad place if there's so much food to go around!
Luke:
Wow, a bakery! And it smells so good...
Petter:
If it's the bakery you want, they're out at the moment. But they should be back soon.
Luke:
That's too bad...
Petter:
But don't you think the taste of the bread has changed a bit recently? And the people working there seem somehow different, too. But then, I also feel like they've always been working there...
Layton:
Do you mean to say you're not certain?
Petter:
No...I'm not. It's just that somehow I have the feeling that there are more people working there now.
Layton:
There is something I would like to ask you. How knowledgeable are you about the people of this town?
Petter:
The people? Well, I have lived here all of my life, so I guess I know most of them. Why do you want to know?
Layton:
I would just like to know if you have ever met a man called Carmine.
Petter:
Carmine? Hmmm... Sorry, but no. I've never seen nor heard of anyone by that name.
Layton:
You've never heard of him? How curious...
Luke:
Do you think he was just going under a different name here?
Layton:
............
Petter:
More importantly, shouldn't you two be on your way? Everyone else is already heading there.
Layton:
Is there something else we should be doing?
Petter:
Are you kidding?! With all the townspeople getting so excited like this? You two must be waiting as well, right? Why not kill some time with a puzzle?

You seriously don't know? Ha! Amazing! To think that there could be anyone in town who could be so clueless... Well, if you don't know... Why not come and see for yourselves? As they say, seeing is believing. Or should it be, "a picture is worth a thousand words"? I'm sure you get what I mean...
Luke:
He could have just told us... This is all a bit exasperating.
Layton:
Well, it looks as if we'll just have to go and see for ourselves. As soon as we've finished looking around, let's head for North Parade Avenue.

Each item has a price tag attached, but what currency is this?
Blacksmith vendor
Luke:
Swords, shields, spears, helms... they're not just for show. They're genuine.
Layton:
This is a smithy, after all. As far as I can see, the blacksmith knows his trade.
Cobblestone path
Luke:
Cobblestones. They remind me of some areas of London.
Layton:
The roads in this town are very well maintained. I wish I could say the same about London.
Knight:
This is definitely the best weapon shop! I could blow a month's pay in this place! This sword, this axe and this mace... And that new shield over there... What more could a knight like me ask for?
Layton:
They all seem to be painstakingly crafted. But I can't help but wonder how a knight would be able to move with all this equipped.
Knight:
A soldier unable to wear this equipment is not fit to be called a knight! What's more, this amount of equipment is but the bare minimum required to effectively oust wrongdoers. Such a knave might come at me just like this...

Yow saw right through that shadowy deception with consummate ease! Such powers of observation are outstanding! If you notice anything untoward, be sure to let me know immediately.
Layton:
Certainly, we'd be pleased to help. Unfortunately, villains tend to be careful too.
Knight:
Hmm...recently I've heard many tales about badly behaved youths. It seems there are two in particular who are up to no good together. I intend to deal with them before any of the townsfolk fall foul to their misdeeds. So I must remain on my guard at all times, in case they suddenly appear!
Luke:
He's definitely a knightly sort of knight! But these streets seem so peaceful, it's hard to imagine any "villains" around here. It's a shame...
Layton:
Well, we must hope they apprehend those individuals soon. Let's offer our support too, where we can.

We must choose our weapons well, so as to be ready to fight at any time!
Price (before solving puzzle given by Petter in E. Shopping Area)
Price:
I say, sir, that's a delightfully elegant hat that you're wearing there! If you were willing to part with it, I would pay a fair price.
Layton:
...I don't see any hats for sale on your shop front.
Price:
Ho ho! You obviously don't frequent this part of town, do you? I'm Price, the pawnbroker. I deal with anything from heirlooms to hats. You can't beat Price when it comes to price.
Layton:
Ah, so you're a pawnbroker. I'm afraid I'm a little too attached to this hat to let it go. After all, it is the mark of a gentleman.
Price:
Very well, I can see it's a treasured item, and rightly so. Never mind, then. But if you're not selling, then how about buying something?
Luke:
Hmm, I wonder if the money we have on us would pass as currency here...
Price:
What's that, you're currently short of funds? Then here's what I'll do... As today is a special day, I'll let you have a little something for free. That is, if you can solve this puzzle... Now, I'll bet this young man excels at puzzles like this one...
Luke:
Huh? You mean to say you're even selling puzzles?!

Price:
Just as I thought, a bright young man!
Luke:
I pride myself on my puzzle-solving skills.
Price:
Then your future is assured! A sharp mind is essential for success. With a mind as sharp as yours, you could even take over my business some day!
Layton:
Just imagining you as a pawnbroker is certainly an entertaining image, Luke.
Luke:
I've always been the professor's apprentice, and I can't imagine doing anything else.
Price (subsequent times)
Price:
Whether you're buying or selling, you won't find a fairer pawnbroker anywhere!
After solving puzzles given by Knight in W. Shopping Area and Petter in E. Shopping Area:
He's come! The 'teller has come!
Quick! We must go and see him on North Parade Avenue!
Oh, no...I'm late! And I'd been meaning to wait from this morning!
Layton:
The centre of the town is certainly bustling. Something looks set to start at North Parade Avenue.
Luke:
Everyone's heading that way... Come on, Professor, let's go with them!
Main Street
Examine
Labyrinthian flag at top left
Luke:
I was staring at that flag for so long that I started to make out a face in the pattern...
Layton:
The coat of arms is unlike anything I have seen in books on the topic.
Luke:
Those flags are all over the place, so they've got to be important, I guess.
Produce vendor
Luke:
They're selling fruit and veg. Good place to get your five-a-day.
Layton:
They also have fish on the other side. It's a grocery stall.
Luke:
The open market is much more fun than shops in the town centre.
Gear vendor
Layton:
I am not averse to admiring implements of this sort.
Luke:
These things don't have anything to do with witches or magic.
Layton:
Archaeologists learn about ancient cultures by examining sundries like these.
Town Centre
Examine
Knight-on-horseback statue
Luke:
It's a statue of a knight. We've got them in London, too.
Layton:
It is a magnificent statue. We can deduce from it that knights are very respected in this town.
Luke:
The water's so pure and cold.
Sleeping cat
Luke:
It's comfortably asleep. Just like in our world, cats take it easy here.
Layton:
Cats used to be valued for catching mice. I wonder if they're kept here for the same reason?
Luke:
This kitty likes sitting on top of barrels.
Layton:
The cat seems determined not to get down unless someone makes it an offering of delicious fish.
Shop billboard
Layton:
The shop sign looks very peculiar. What do they sell here, I wonder?
Luke:
The shop's not open yet. The door's locked.
E. Shopping Area
Examine
Milk wagon
Luke:
Where do the wagons with milk come from?
Layton:
I haven't seen any cows or goats around here, but there may be a farm outside the town?
Luke:
Someone left their wagon unsupervised.
Seafood vendor
Luke:
So many types of fish! Is there a river or a lake nearby?
Layton:
Interesting. I, too, wonder where they obtain so much fish from.
Luke:
The fish are very fresh. Some are still alive, in fact.
Bread on right
Luke:
Mmm...there's a delicious smell coming from the bakery.
Layton:
There is only one bakery in this area, it would seem.
Luke:
So many types of bread! Sweet, savoury...
W. Shopping Area
Examine
Dry goods shop on left
Layton:
A sundries shop. Pots and vases of various sizes are lined up on display.
Luke:
I'm not sure if you could call it a sundries shop. It looks like they specialise in earthenware?
Layton:
Perhaps it is an antique shop. Although I am not sure if the concept exists here.
Blacksmith vendor
Luke:
The wares he's peddling look pretty heavy. I can't believe he can walk carrying all that.
Layton:
He looks athletic, but what is physical strength compared to the power of witches?
Luke:
The trade with the knights seems to be flourishing.
Cobblestone path
Luke:
The middle of the road is paved with white cobblestones.
Layton:
These cobblestones surround the shopping district. This must be the main street.
Luke:
If you follow the white line, you won't get lost.
North Parade Avenue (after solving puzzles given by Knight in W. Shopping Area and Petter in E. Shopping Area)
Tuggit:
This is it! He's about to appear! This is the moment I've been waiting for ever since I began queuing this morning!
Muffet:
I can hear their footsteps! He'll be here any moment now! And that means Inquisitor Barnham will be with him! Oh, I just can't wait to see Zacky-wacky up cwose!
Mailer:
Come on! Come on! We're waiting! Once it's over, I have to get back and finish my deliveries... Come on!
Bardly:
We people have gathered, In the street we all wait. Waiting to see him, to learn of our fate♪
Allan:
Dearie me... Look at them all, clamouring for a peek! It's as if this has never happened before... It would be more fitting and proper to wait with calmness and solemnity, to show our respect. I always have trouble mingling with the common masses...
Mary:
Now, now, out of the way! Let a lady and her goat see!
Snowy:
Baaa!
Captain:
Attention, you rabble! Keep that line straight there!
Luke:
It looks like it's beginning at last, Professor!
Layton:
Yes, you appear to be right, my boy. The level of excitement is remarkable.
Mary:
Hey, you! You with the tall hat! I can't see a thing!
Layton:
I beg your pardon, madam. What might be the occasion?
Mary:
What are you saying?! I've never heard such nonsense... And to think that he is about to appear!
Luke:
Sorry, but when you say "he", who exactly do you mean?
Mary:
Surely you two can't be serious! Why, it's him, of course! The town's creator...the Storyteller himself!
Layton:
The Storyteller...
Luke:
Huh?! The creator of Labyrinthia?!
Anime cutscene
Luke:
Wow, Professor, this is amazing!
Layton:
And that must be... this town's "creator"...
Woman:
Thank you, Storyteller! Thank you for granting me this lovely baby girl!
Man:
Look at my mother! She was ill in bed, but now she's as fit as a fiddle!
Darklaw:
People of Labyrinthia! Behold your new Story!
Luke:
Wow, that was amazing, wasn't it, Professor!
Layton:
Indeed. But, something would appear to be amiss...
Muffet:
Eeek! This stowy is too howwible!
Tuggit:
Without a doubt, this is terrible...
Mailer:
Th-this...doesn't look good. Today, I'll finish up my deliveries and go home early!
Luke:
Up until a moment ago everyone was so excited... But now that the parade has passed, the mood here seems totally different.
Layton:
They all seem to be afraid of something.
Luke:
Yes, it's very strange... Ah! Professor, there's one of those sheets of paper over there.
Layton:
That must be one of the sheets that the knights were throwing to the crowd. The problem seems to be related to what is written on those sheets of paper.
Luke:
Hang on, I'll pick one of them up. This doesn't look like a typical letter or anything like that...
Layton:
It's hard to imagine what could be so terrible... Let's start by giving it a read through.
Luke:
Okay, Professor!
Story Fragment added to Items.
The fearsome witch moved deeper into the moonlit wood, casting a deathly shadow as she passed between the trees. And when the two young companions stepped into the darkness of the wood, they were drawn into her magic fire, and their lives were consumed in its flames.
NEW MYSTERY
The Storyteller
After finding themselves in Labyrinthia, the professor and Luke saw the parade of the town's creator, the Storyteller. But on reading the Story that was distributed to them, the townsfolk became afraid.
The horrific Story on the piece of paper described how two young companions would be burned to death by a witch.
Luke:
What could that mean? A witch again?! And what about where it says, "their lives were consumed in the flames"?
Layton:
Luke, let us cast our minds back to what Espella said in London... I seem to recall her mentioning that those witches had followed her from Labyrinthia.
Luke:
So that would mean...that the witches we saw in London really were from this town... The witch in this story... Do you think she's the one from before?
Layton:
It's still too early to say. But at any rate, this seemingly prophetic story, is rather disturbing...
Muffet:
I onwy came here to see Inquisitor Barnham! And this...this stowy is what I get! Oh my, what bad wuck this is!
Tuggit:
Oh no-no-no! Things had been so peaceful, and now the witch is to strike once again... What a fearful world we live in.
Mary:
What a horrible story! I can't stay here any longer. I'm heading straight back to the market stall, where I can be with my lovely little goats!
Layton:
Well, it seems that what's written here is indeed the reason for all this unrest.
Luke:
It's definitely a little ominous... But it's only a story, isn't it?
Muffet:
It's pwecisely because it's the Stowy that we're all so afwaid! Don't you even know that much?
Tuggit:
Without fail... Whenever a witch appears, somebody dies!
Luke:
Even if what you say is true, there's no reason to be afraid. After all, it's just a story. It's hardly going to become a reality...
Muffet:
...What are you saying?!
Tuggit:
Yes, what do you mean by that?!
Luke:
Eh?
Muffet:
You're not impwying that you don't bewieve in the Stowy, are you?!
Tuggit:
No-no-no...no-no-no... Nooooooo!
Layton:
............
Tuggit:
You'll get your comeuppance for this!
Knight:
Hmm? Hey, you two! What's all the fuss about?!
Luke:
Us? Um, nothing...we're not making a fuss!
Captain:
What is it? Is something the matter?
Knight:
Captain! It's these two, sir! They're creating a bit of a disturbance...
Captain:
Well, well, it's you two... Causing trouble again, are you?
Tuggit:
Ah, Captain! These two here are claiming that the Story won't become a reality! How can they say such a thing?!
Captain:
What's that?! This simply can't be... You claim that you don't believe what the Storyteller writes? ............! Could it be that you two...?
No...it couldn't be...
A moment ago they were claiming to have seen a witch... Honestly, that's what they were saying!
Look, there are two of them! They could be the two in the Story!
The pair that gets killed by the witch... Well, they could be...
Even if they're not, they must have something to do with the witch...
Luke:
P-Professor...
Layton:
This atmosphere is somewhat unsettling...
Captain:
It appears my original instincts regarding you two were indeed well founded! You're clearly suspicious! Men, surround them!
Luke:
Uh-oh...
Layton:
...Easy, Luke!
Luke:
P-Professor! This isn't good... Perhaps we should make a run for it!
Layton:
Agreed...but running off blindly in any old direction is unlikely to prove successful... We're too unfamiliar with the streets of this town.
Captain:
Oi! I wouldn't think of running if I were you! Just give up peacefully.
Luke:
Professor...
Layton:
............
???:
...Mr Layton! ...Luke! Both of you...over here!
Layton:
............! That voice!
Luke:
Hang on, isn't that...
Layton:
The voice came from that back street over there... Come on, Luke...let's run!
Luke:
Okay, Professor!
Captain:
Oi, wait! Stop! Come back here! After them, men! They're getting away!
Knight:
Yes, sir! Captain!
Layton:
As I thought... It really was you, Espella.
Luke:
But...why? Why are you...?
Espella:
Shhh! I'll explain later... Please, just wait here quietly.
Luke:
...R-right.
Captain:
Where are they?! Which way did they go?!
Knight:
C-Captain, we seem to have lost them...
Captain:
What?! They must still be here somewhere! Find them!
Espella:
............
Layton:
It appears we've managed to elude them... But what now?
Luke:
We can't stay here... They're bound to find us sooner or later.
Espella:
Let's move elsewhere. If we keep to the back streets, we should be able to reach the square without being seen. Follow me!
Layton:
Okay. We're in your hands.
Espella:
Come on, this way! And keep quiet...
Town Square Outskirts
Layton:
That was rather too close for comfort. It seems you rescued us this time...
Espella:
It was nothing. I'm just glad you were both able to get away safely. But...what are you both doing here in Labyrinthia?
Luke:
We'd like to ask you the same question! What about you, Espella? What happened after we were separated in London? I remember you jumping aboard that cargo vessel... Did you have any trouble getting away?
Espella:
Well, I...uh...that is, I...
Layton:
Easy now, Luke. We mustn't bombard Espella with questions like that.
Luke:
I-I'm sorry, Espella...
Espella:
No, I'm the one who should apologise. I'm afraid it's just not very clear...
Layton:
You have no reason to apologise, Espella. But when you say it's "not very clear", what do you mean, precisely?
Espella:
Well, to be honest...I seem to be unable to clearly recall what happened...
Layton:
Hmm...is that so...? After we put you aboard that ship, we should have followed after you... But at any rate, I'm relieved to see that you're all right now.
Espella:
Yes, I am. Thanks to you both. It's good that we could meet again like this. I'm so happy to see you here!
Luke:
Too right! We're both very happy too, aren't we, Professor?
Layton:
We certainly are, Luke.
Espella:
Let me guess... You both came here to solve the puzzles of Labyrinthia, didn't you?
Luke:
Um, well, yes...something like that. Right, Professor?
Layton:
Actually, the truth of the matter is, we don't really know why we're here.
Espella:
Eh...?
Layton:
It seems as if... Well, it's almost as if we've been sucked right into that book's story.
Espella:
Sucked into...the Story?
Layton:
If it's okay with you, Espella, I'd like to ask you some questions about Labyrinthia.
Luke:
We can't really settle down here for a chat, can we? Those knights might find us again! We'll need somewhere to lie low for a while.
Espella:
............ Ah, I know! If it's all right with you two...
Luke:
Yes?
Espella:
For now, Mrs Eclaire, the local bread maker, is kindly putting me up in her shop. If you don't mind, you're welcome to come to my room. I'm afraid it's only an attic room, so it's a little small.
Luke:
Really? I mean, are you sure that's okay? If they were to find us there, wouldn't that mean trouble for everyone at the shop?
Espella:
Not at all! You shouldn't even think like that. After all, it was you two who rescued me in London, wasn't it? So if there's anything I can do... You must let me help in whatever way I can!
Layton:
Espella... Thank you. Allow us to graciously accept your kind offer.
Espella:
Okay! Let's make our way there, while keeping an eye out for those knights. The bakery is on the eastern side of town.
MYSTERY SOLVED
Labyrinthia's Secret
The town of Labyrinthia is a mysterious place of witches and witchcraft, where everything written by the Storyteller becomes reality.
Labyrinthia is a world in which the people live in fear of witches and witchcraft, and where knights are their only protection.

Layton:
Hmm. The door and windows on the ground floor are shut. Could this be so for safety reasons?
Luke:
If this was my house, I'd keep the windows open during the day to let fresh air in.
Espella:
The townspeople are afraid of witches, so they bolt the doors and keep the windows shut tight.
Fountain
Layton:
It's a water fountain. The water looks very clear. It may be suitable for drinking.
Luke:
There must be a spring somewhere nearby.

The witch...the witch is coming!

Ah...so you both read the story too, right?
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Boo-hoo! I'm a-afraid...of the w-witch! Save me, sis!
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
You wimp! You're a boy, aren't you?! It should be the other way around! You should be the one saving me! You're the one who wants to be a knight!
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
Boo-hoo... I can't beat a witch... ...I'm toast!
Cecil &amp; Petal (Petal):
Will you just stop crying! What about me, huh? How d'ya think I feel?
Cecil &amp; Petal (Cecil):
I'll never be a knight... ...boo-hoo!

Don't worry, you just have to be brave. You can still be a knight! And you can look after your sister, too. Here, it's just like in this puzzle...

Luke:
Look at that bench, Professor! Wouldn't it be nice to spend a whole day on it, reading in the sunshine?
Layton:
Luke, we are carrying out an investigation. This is not the time to be lazing about on a bench.
Espella:
Yes...we should be on our way.
Belfry
Layton:
A single bell hangs in the belfry. Perhaps it is sounded on special occasions.
Luke:
That's one huge bell.
Bell tower entrance
Luke:
Some knights are standing guard at the entrance. I guess we can't go in.
Layton:
It is plausible that the guards are there to make sure no one goes to ring the bell without permission.
Espella:
It is forbidden to enter the bell tower. Everyone in this town knows about it.

Nozey:
This is not good, not good at all. And to think, I was so looking forward to the Storyteller's parade.
Layton:
You've seen the story too, I presume.
Nozey:
Of course I have. But luckily there's only one of me, so I won't become a victim. I still don't see why the Storyteller can't just write happy stories, though... I imagine you feel the same, don't you?
Espella:
Yes...yes, I suppose so.
Nozey:
Oh, Espella... Well, the shadows are growing longer... It's time I was off home!
Luke:
Eh?! But it's only just after lunch time.
Nozey:
My home is far from here! So, er... Be seeing you!
Luke:

Price
Price:
Hello, sir. Did you gentlemen see the parade?
Layton:
We certainly did. The turnout was most impressive. It seemed almost everyone in the town was present.
Price:
Well it's always a good turnout. But more to the point, what do you make of the Story? The very idea of a witch appearing makes me shudder... I'm thinking of closing up shop and heading home early today.
Layton:
So do you believe it will be safer to stay at home tonight?
Price:
That's exactly what I believe! But that's not all... Just look at the weaponsmith over there. His weapons are selling like hot cakes.
Luke:
Why are weapons selling so well?
Price:
Well, lad, I should have thought that would be obvious... It's because the knights are buying them! They're replenishing their stock of weapons on account of the witch. As a merchant, I'm rather envious. He'll surely make a fine profit this day. Meanwhile, I'm but a pawnbroker, getting almost no custom at all.
Luke:
Hmm, that's too bad...
Price:
You gentlemen should also consider going home before it gets dark.
Layton:
We thank you for the warning.
Price (subsequent times)
Price:
They're all buying weapons in preparation for fighting the witch. Well, that's what my neighbour says. I'd like to be making as much profit as him.

Captain:
What...?! This is a disgrace...letting those two slip away from under our very noses like that! Let's take another look!
Knight:
Yes, sir!
Luke:
Sounds like we shouldn't be hanging around this area too long...
Layton:
Indeed. Let's head for the East Shopping Area before they find us.
Espella:
I agree. If we lay low for a while at my place, perhaps the knights will give up and go home too.

Allan
Allan:
Did you two see the latest story?
Layton:
When you say "latest"...am I to assume that these parades are held on a regular basis?
Allan:
You mean you don't know that? People these days... No one knows a thing... Never mind. I'm a forgiving sort. I suppose I should fill the gaps in your knowledge.
Luke:
That's not very polite...
Allan:
Ahem... The Storyteller appears in a parade before the common people whenever he writes a new story. It would be no overstatement to say that I spend every waking day looking forward to the stories that he provides.
Luke:
So you look forward to stories in which witches burn people?
Allan:
What are you saying?! That only happens to be the Story this time! Usually the Storyteller writes the most wonderful stories. That's why I thought he would give us a wonderful chapter today, too... Instead, I found myself caught up in the crowd. My glasses were broken, and I was bitten by a dog...
Layton:
Don't feel down. Every cloud has a silver lining, so they say.
Allan:
Don't feel down? Don't feel down, you say...?! Do I look like I am feeling down? Bah! No way am I feeling down! If my unhappiness is recorded in the Storyteller's pages, then so be it! Oh, sorrow... A part of me is such sweet sorrow!
Layton:
It seems that not all stories are born equal...
Luke:
Why do I feel that a person's character might have something to do with it?
Allan (subsequent times)
Allan:
For certain, the next story will hold something good for me.
Tuggit
Tuggit:
Ah, it's you two... You were causing quite a bit of a commotion earlier.
Luke:
We weren't causing a commotion!
Tuggit:
The Storyteller's Story is always right. And I cannot abide anyone saying otherwise.
Layton:
Then you believe that a witch will appear and commit some foul crimes?
Tuggit:
Of course I do! The Storyteller decides everything that happens in this town. Whether folk meet with good fortune or ill, all that comes to pass is already decided by the Storyteller. Whoever the victims are, they're probably up to no good on a regular basis. I spend every day as an upstanding citizen, so even if a witch does appear... I have absolutely nothing to worry about. ...Nothing to worry about...
Luke:
............?
Tuggit:
Mmm...mmm... Argh!
Layton:
............
Tuggit:
It's no use pretending! I am afraid of the witch! Argh...... It's over for me!
Luke:
Maybe you ought to go home as soon as you can...
Tuggit (subsequent times)
Tuggit:
The witch is coming! The witch is coming! It's all over for me...... Argh!
Blue striped awning on left
Layton:
The atmosphere of gaiety has dissipated. That Story has fearsome power over the people here.
Luke:
Shopkeepers and customers all look so grim.
Third floor windows in house on closer right
Layton:
The person who was waving up there is now gone.
Luke:
The townspeople were overjoyed to see the Storyteller at first, but now...

Espella:
Ah...we're here. This is the bakery!
Luke:
Mmmm...I can smell the bread baking!
Espella:
There are some excellent bakers working here. Come on, I'll introduce you!
A new destination has been added to the map: Bakery.
Examine
Petter
Petter:
So, did you both read the Story?
Layton:
Yes, we did. It said a witch will appear and two young people will be burned...right?
Petter:
It's a terrible story. There will be a feeling of dread hanging over the town tonight...
Luke:
Aren't you afraid? You seem so relaxed.
Petter:
Well, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't afraid... But what's written is written, and there's nothing we can do about it. The Story can't be changed once it's been written...so no use moaning about it now.
Layton:
Don't you feel there's even a possibility that the story may not come true?
Petter:
That sounds a bit deluded to me. You know, you should be careful... The story was of two young people, and I'm thinking that matches you two perfectly... Aren't you afraid?
Luke:
Afraid...us? Nah! And anyway, we're a group of three at the moment.
Espella:
Hello, Petter. Have you come to buy bread again today? I think there's some freshly baked bread about to come out of the oven.
Petter:
Ah, yes, maybe I'll do that. Thanks, Espella.
Layton:
............?
Petter (subsequent times)
Petter:
All you can do is pray that the Story's not referring to you two.
Seafood vendor
Luke:
So many types of fish! Is there a river or a lake nearby?
Layton:
Interesting. I, too, wonder where they obtain so much fish from.
Luke:
The fish are very fresh. Some are still alive, in fact.
Espella:
I tried to bake fish bread one day, but it didn't turn out too well.
Bread on right
Luke:
Mmm...there's a delicious smell coming from the bakery.
Layton:
There is only one bakery in this area, it would seem.
Luke:
So many types of bread! Sweet, savoury...
Espella:
I help out at the bakery, too. Nowadays I hardly ever burn anything.
Bakery
Leads to:
"Ahhh...Professor, it's the smell of freshly baked bread!"
Bakery
Luke:
Ahhh...Professor, it's the smell of freshly baked bread!
Layton:
Indeed, Luke. It's certainly whetting my appetite.
Luke:
I bet the staff here are really talented!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Our bakery uses only the finest ingredients! Upper-crust goods for not much dough!
Layton:
Talented...and highly enthusiastic, it seems.
Luke:
...He's kneading the dough pretty hard, isn't he...?
Layton:
I would rather liken the motion to "pounding", myself.
Espella:
Oh, um... Mr Wright, these gentlemen aren't customers...they're my friends.
Phoenix:
Oh...really?
Maya:
Hey, Espella, welcome home!
Espella:
Hello, Maya. Um...where's Aunt Patty?
Maya:
The boss? She's gone to the market. She should be back at any time now. Sorry about Nick here, he didn't realise you weren't customers.
Layton:
Not at all. There's nothing wrong with such sincere dedication to one's job.
Espella:
Mr Wright, Maya, meet my friends, Mr Layton and Luke.
Layton:
A pleasure. My name is Hershel Layton.
Luke:
And I'm Luke Triton. Nice to meet you!
Maya:
I'm Maya Fey. And this is Nick...my assistant baker!
Phoenix:
Phoenix Wright, pleased to meet you. How come I'm the "assistant"?!
Layton:
Mr Phoenix Wright and Miss Maya Fey. ...Somehow not quite the kind of names I'd expect to hear around here. Have you both been working here long?
Maya:
Yup! Must be going on five years now. Isn't that right, Espella?
Espella:
Ah...yes, I suppose it must be.
Maya:
...Say, you know what? Seeing as you're both friends of Espella, I think we can give you guys a little something... On the house, of course.
Luke:
Wow, really?
Phoenix:
Sure, why not? I actually just took some freshly baked walnut bread out of the oven, so...
Luke:
Cor, so that's what that great smell is! I bet it's delicious!
Maya:
If you think the scent is good, you should try TASTING it. You too, Mr Layton. It's so good, it'll knock your hat off!
Layton:
I'd be delighted to. That's most kind of you.
Maya:
Well, that's that then! Go ahead and help yourselves...
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Our bakery uses only the finest walnuts! You'll go nuts for our walnut bread!
............
Maya:
How many times do I gotta tell you, Nick?! You're supposed to say "here's your order"!
Phoenix:
Oh, uhh...yeah... That's right. I forgot... I don't know why, but... I just get the urge to point and shout like that sometimes...
Maya:
Bad Nick! Bad! You can't keep shouting at the customers like that... The boss'll be all over you like butter on toast!
Phoenix:
Ugh...
Luke:
That baker...he's...quite a character, isn't he, Professor?
Layton:
Yes, indeed. There's something curious about both of them... They both seem somehow...out of place in "this world". Most intriguing...
Espella:
My room is upstairs. We can get there from behind the counter. Feel free to take something to eat.
Maya:
Noooooooo!
Luke:
Wh-what's wrong?!
Layton:
She seems to be upset about something... Let's ask her if there's anything we can do to help.
Luke:
Right you are, Professor!

Phoenix Wright
Phoenix:
Sorry if I came across as rude earlier...
Layton:
Please, pay it no thought.
Phoenix:
It's just that sometimes I get carried away when I'm pounding the dough like that.
Luke:
Well, it was kind of surprising to hear a big thump like that, even if you were just kneading the dough... And when you said "Take that!", my heart nearly stopped!
Phoenix:
When I bake great bread, I guess I just feel the need to present it to the customer like...that.
Bread on top shelf
Layton:
A large variety of bread. One could have a different type every day of the week.
Luke:
They're all baked to perfection, and the smell is making my mouth water.
Layton:
Ah, the smell of freshly baked scones. They would go very well with some tea.
Espella:
We also deliver bread to other parts of the town.
Wood oven fire
Luke:
So hot! That's where bread is baked, huh.
Layton:
It's a sturdy-looking wood-burning oven.
Luke:
You can bake many batches of bread at the same time in an oven this size.
Espella:
Baking bread requires more physical strength than most people think.
Layton:
What's the matter, Miss Fey?
Maya:
It's these loaves of bread... And after I'd arranged them all so nicely, too... Grrr! It's all Nick's fault! His pounding messed up everything!
Phoenix:
Me? But I was only kneading the dough...
Maya:
What am I going to do?! I have to fix this before the boss gets back!
Layton:
Hmmm, that's most unfortunate. Perhaps we can lend you a helping hand.
Maya:
REALLY?! Thanks a lot! You'd be doing me the BIGGEST favour in the world!
Phoenix:
Maya...you could try to show a little restraint sometimes, you know.
Layton:
Not at all. Helping those in need is the duty of any true gentleman.
Luke:
Not only that, but if we all chip in and help, we'll soon have it sorted out!
Maya:
Totally! We should all help each other out in times of need, right?!

Phoenix:
Hey! Maya! The boss is back!
Patty:
Hello, everyone! Just as I was wondering what the commotion was all about, I see you're back, Espella.
Espella:
Welcome home, Aunt Patty.
Patty:
Were Maya and Phoenix doing a proper job of minding the shop while I was gone?
Maya:
O-of course we did!
Phoenix:
Naturally! You know you can count on us!
Luke:
They may be calling her "boss", but she seems like such a warm and friendly person.
Layton:
She certainly does, Luke. And she has a heart-warming smile, too.
Patty:
Oh, such flattery! You're just trying to make me blush! By the way, Espella, are these two gentlemen customers of ours?
Espella:
These two are friends of mine. They kindly helped me out once, in the past. I was so happy to see them again that I invited them here.
Layton:
Pleased to meet you, madam. My name's Hershel Layton.
Luke:
And I'm Luke Triton, the professor's apprentice!
Patty:
Is that so? It seems Espella is indebted to you both, so it's certainly a pleasure to meet you both. As a thank you from me for helping Espella, please feel free to stay for as long as you like. We just happen to have an empty room that you're welcome to use if you wish.
Layton:
Thank you for your kind offer, madam.
Espella:
Ah, yes. I imagine you must both be feeling hungry.
Luke:
Well actually, I'm more than a little peckish.
Patty:
Ah, you don't say! Well, in that case, let me offer you something special... My very own creation!
Layton:
Aha! Wonderful! And that face baked on the surface... a masterpiece!
Patty:
Yes, I'm proud of it. I use a secret technique to make it extra fluffy!
Maya:
Only the best for our special guests!
Luke:
This is great!
Maya:
Still, we don't really have a whole lot else to offer...only bread.
Patty:
............ ..."Only" bread?
Maya:
Uh...I mean...
Phoenix:
H-hey...Espella! Uh... Shouldn't you show our guests to their room? Let's just forget the bread.
Patty:
"Forget" the bread...?
Phoenix:
I mean...
Espella:
M-Mr Layton, Luke. Let's go upstairs, now!
Luke:
Huh? What's going on?
Espella:
Just trust me, come on!
Patty:
"Only bread"..."forget the bread"?! What kind of attitude is that? You two really expect to become fully fledged bakers some day?! Any more of this half-baked attitude, and I'll throw you in the oven until you're both well done!
Espella's Room
Luke:
I, um...didn't expect that.
Espella:
I'm sorry, she's usually so kind and gentle. But when it comes to bread...
Layton:
I suppose it shows just how dedicated she is to her craft.
Luke:
I guess it must be fun to live in such a lively place, though.
Espella:
Yes, it is. It's thanks to them that I enjoy living here as much as I do. Mrs Eclaire is always so cheerful and kind to me. And Maya and Mr Wright are so energetic... Maya, especially.
Luke:
It's certainly an interesting group. Particularly those two... But, Espella, what about your family?
Espella:
I, um... It's a bit complicated...
Luke:
Sorry, I didn't mean to pry...
???:
Meeow!
Espella:
Ah...Eve.
Eve:
Meeow!
Espella:
What's the matter, Eve? Are you hungry? Sorry, it's my cat. It must be supper time.
Layton:
Ah, I see. Please, go ahead. Don't mind us.

Layton:
A finely groomed black cat, I must say. I'm sure Espella takes excellent care of it.

Thick volumes are lined up on the shelf.
Layton:
Labyrinthian books...interesting. I would like to read some when we have time.

They're all very thick. It would take you some time to read them, Professor.
Espella:
I like reading before going to sleep. I've read these books many times.

Layton:
Jars with...jam, perhaps? They all have vibrant colours.

I am sure this jam would be even more delicious on Mrs Eclaire's freshly baked bread.

I made all this jam myself. You can try some if you want.
Luke:
It's such a cute cat! So well behaved and clever, too.
Espella:
Thank you. Eve is a real friend...
Eve:
Meeow...
Espella:
Oh, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. Mr Layton, you wanted to ask me something, didn't you? What was it that you wanted to know?
Layton:
Well, there are a few things... Perhaps I'd better ask them one at a time. It may take a little while, if you can spare the time.
Espella:
Yes, of course. Anything I can do to help.
Layton:
Thank you, Espella. Well then, first off... (What I want to ask Espella about, is...)
After we separated in London...
Layton:
Could you tell us again what happened, between the time that we were separated in London and your returning to Labyrinthia? You said you can't clearly recall what happened to you, is that right?
Espella:
No, I can't. When I came to...I was back here in Labyrinthia. I can remember everything up until I boarded that cargo ship... But after that I just can't seem to remember how I got back here. It seems the townsfolk didn't even notice that I'd been away... I almost thought the whole thing must have just been a dream, until the two of you appeared here in Labyrinthia. It seems I wasn't dreaming after all...
Layton:
Yes, indeed. It all really did happen. You came to my office, and then the witch came for you.
Luke:
So, does that mean that the witch brought Espella back to Labyrinthia?
Espella:
Well, I suppose so... But... Why was I in...London in the first place?
Luke:
Eh?
Espella:
Why did I meet you two gentlemen...? And why was the witch after me...? I just can't seem to remember why...
Luke:
Espella, you and Carmine were running away from the witches, weren't you?
Espella:
Carmine...?
Layton:
Do you mean to say that you don't remember being in London with Carmine?
Luke:
Carmine took you with him and tried to escape from this town.
Espella:
Carmine...took me with him and tried to escape...? ............ I'm sorry...I do have a vague memory of Carmine, but... Why was I in London? ............ I just can't seem to remember...
Luke:
............
Layton:
Hmm...
After we separated in London... (subsequent times)
Espella:
Why would witches be chasing me in London......? I do remember meeting you, Professor, and you, Luke.
Espella's memories
Layton:
Do you remember this letter, Espella?
Espella:
A letter...?
Layton:
Yes. Carmine gave you this letter and instructed you to bring it to me. You followed his advice and brought it to me in my office.
Espella:
That letter...could I take a closer look at it?
Layton:
Yes, of course.
Espella:
............
Layton:
Do you remember anything?
Espella:
I don't remember the letter...but this writing does look somewhat familiar... I do have a feeling...that there was someone there next to me... ............!
Layton:
Espella, are you all right?
Espella:
I...I think I remember... I remember Carmine.
Luke:
Really?
Espella:
You're right, I do know him... I definitely know Carmine. Carmine was here in this town. In fact, he was in this very shop.
Layton:
............ In this shop, Espella?
Luke:
But according to the townsfolk, they've never even heard of him...
Espella:
Yes...yes, that's right. What they say contradicts what I remember. That's why I'm finding it so difficult to trust my own memories...
Layton:
Please, don't let that deter you. We'd be grateful to hear what you know.
Espella's memories (subsequent times)
Espella:
I can't accurately recall what happened in London, but when you showed me the letter... I remembered Carmine being here in Labyrinthia. I remember him quite clearly now. How...how do I have this memory...?
What she can recall (appears after "After we separated in London..." and "Espella's memories")
Layton:
Please, do let us know what you can recall.
Espella:
According to my memory, Carmine was working here in this bakery.
Luke:
Eh? But there are already two workers in the shop, right? Mr Wright and Maya.
Espella:
Those two have also been working here making bread for some time now. Or at least... I'm quite sure...that must be the case... Mrs Eclaire and anyone else around here would soon tell you so. That's why I put no faith in my memory.
Layton:
Hmm...this difference in perception is certainly intriguing. And the fact that Carmine worked here has me somewhat curious.
Luke:
Do you think all the townsfolk could just be pretending not to know? I mean, maybe Carmine really was here and they're acting like they don't remember. After all, he did mention in that letter that he wrote... that he escaped from Labyrinthia. How about we go and ask a few people around the town?
Layton:
No, Luke, I don't think that's a good idea. As you are no doubt well aware by now, a single word out of place can be enough to bring in the knights against us.
Espella:
Not only that, but I really cannot believe that Mrs Eclaire would pretend not to know him. She's always so straight with people... She's never two-faced.
Luke:
I see...
Layton:
Perhaps, Luke, we should be thankful that she took care of him.
Luke:
Yes, you're right of course, Professor!
Layton:
By the way, in that letter, Carmine claimed that this town held a mysterious secret. He implied that he wanted me to solve Labyrinthia's mystery. Do you have any idea what that mystery could be?
Espella:
...Labyrinthia's mystery...? I'm sorry, but I've never even suspected that this town holds any secrets.
Layton:
Then what might it have been that Carmine was investigating?
Espella:
What was Carmine investigating...? ............Ah! I think I might know what it could be. One time, Carmine asked me this: "Why is it that whatever is written by the Storyteller in the Historia Labyrinthia always becomes fact? If that puzzle can be solved, then we will unravel the mystery of Labyrinthia," he said.
Luke:
So Carmine didn't believe that what's written must always come true either...
Espella:
Well, I'm not sure, but...
Luke:
But what?
Espella:
It's only natural that what's written in that book must come true. And it's hard for me to believe that both you and Carmine could doubt this.
Luke:
Well, speaking for myself, I can't just believe it so easily!
Layton:
Nevertheless, to the people of Labyrinthia, it appears to be a matter of common sense. Which is why those knights treated us with such suspicion.
Luke:
That's true, but...
Espella:
Are you saying that... in your London...there's no Story?
Layton:
Well, there are certainly none that come true, as the Historia Labyrinthia does. In the world as we know it, such a notion is inconceivable.
Espella:
As I suspected... Carmine is from the same London as you two... So I suppose it makes perfect sense that you should all think in that way.
Layton:
Incidentally, what action did Carmine take after he came to suspect the story?
Espella:
Um...well, Carmine often visited the Great Archive.
Layton:
The Great Archive?
Espella:
Yes, that's where all the volumes of the Story are kept.
Layton:
You mean to say, all previous volumes too?
Espella:
Yes, every volume of the Story so far. All of them.
Layton:
I see... In other words, he wanted to confirm the authenticity of the story.
Luke:
But, Professor, surely he wouldn't be in trouble with the witches just for looking at some books?
Layton:
As I recall, in the letter he sent to me, he wrote:
"I realised the town held a mysterious secret and decided to get to the bottom of it... ...but before I could, they found me."
Layton:
I believe that was it. Which probably means it wasn't just ordinary books that he was investigating. It's quite likely that the books had something to do with the witches.
Espella:
So you mean...Carmine came close to unravelling Labyrinthia's mystery... And therefore became the witches' target... is what you are suggesting?
Layton:
I believe that would be highly probable.
Espella:
But, why did the witches... ............
Luke:
Um...Espella? Have there been other stories involving witches before this?
Espella:
...Ah, yes. There have been many stories about them. All of these stories are also being kept in the Great Archive.
What she can recall (subsequent times)
Espella:
Carmine seemed to doubt these stories. Which is why he visited the Great Archive so many times.
The witch's story (appears after "What she can recall")
Leads to:
"Stories about the witches are no doubt a source of considerable fear for the townsfolk."
Layton:
Stories about the witches are no doubt a source of considerable fear for the townsfolk. So why is it deemed necessary to keep such stories in the Great Archive?
Espella:
They are an important source of information for the Inquisition. Their prime objective is to capture witches and protect the people of the town.
Layton:
So you're saying that in order to fight the witches, it is essential to read about them and learn their ways?
Espella:
Yes, that's right. Stories involving the witches are under the authority of the order of knights. And the order of knights was established to protect the town of Labyrinthia.
The Storyteller, the order of knights and the Inquisition; they are the ones who govern this town. The entire fate of Labyrinthia is decided by the Creator...otherwise known as the Storyteller. ...That personage is the "weaver" of all life in Labyrinthia. Including the current horrifying story, involving the actions of a witch. It then falls to the order of knights to protect the townsfolk from such events. The knights not only protect the people, but also act as the Storyteller's guard. And finally...the Inquisition is responsible for trying the witches in the Witches' Court. ...That is the manner in which this town is managed and order is maintained.
Layton:
Undoubtedly, it was the order of knights keeping peace during the parade we saw.
Espella:
That's right. The Storyteller holds those parades from time to time. He gives the townsfolk the Story that will determine their fate from that time onwards. The Story this time involved a witch, which explains why the knights were on such high alert. I wonder what spells will be used this time... If only we could check in that book...
Layton:
......! Just a moment, Espella. What was it that you just said? Do you mean to say that there is a book about magic?
Espella:
Y-yes, there is...in the Great Archive. It describes all of the spells that provide the witches with their wicked power. It is a special book, used by the Knights of the Inquisition, to aid them in their investigations.
Layton:
That's it! That must have been what Carmine was so interested in. He was investigating the witches' power. Of course, it's possible that he came upon a secret that he shouldn't have known...
Luke:
And that's why the witches attacked him...?
Layton:
Indeed, Luke. That may well be the reason. The Story, so respected by the people, and the witches whom they fear... There could be a certain secret connecting these two in some way.
Layton:
Thank you, Espella. It seems we now know where to begin with our investigation.
Espella:
So you'll be visiting the Great Archive?
Layton:
Yes, indeed. The book about magic that resides there, may well provide a valuable clue towards unravelling the mystery of Labyrinthia.
Luke:
We'd better get going with our investigation straight away, right, Professor?!
Layton:
Absolutely, Luke. We must solve this puzzle for Carmine's sake, as well as for our own.
Espella:
Um...Mr Layton? ............ Please... Please take me along with you!
Layton:
Hmm...I'm not sure that's wise. It might put you in more than a little trouble. It is likely that Carmine's investigations are what led to him being pursued by witches. And if that's the case, the path we tread may well be fraught with danger.
Espella:
Even so... I really would like to help you. Talking with you both like this... I, too, have come to believe that there must be a secret to this town. I want to help you find the truth!
Layton:
Well, Espella... I suppose that settles it. From here on in, let's all do our very best to solve this mystery together.
Espella:
Yes, together!
Luke:
I'm the professor's apprentice, so if there's anything you need to know, just ask!
Espella:
Ha ha, thank you, Luke. I'll be sure to do that!
Layton:
Well then, without any further ado, let's follow in Carmine's footsteps and visit the Great Archive. I'm quite certain that's where the clues are waiting to be found.
Espella:
Yes, let's go!
Eve:
Meeeow!
Espella:
Not you, Eve...I'm afraid you'll have to stay here until I get back.
Eve:
Meeeow?
Espella:
Oh! My pendant. I almost forgot it.
Layton:
That's a lovely pendant, Espella.
Espella:
It's very old. I can't even remember how old I was when I started wearing it. Right. Sorry to have kept you. Shall we leave for the Great Archive now?
Bakery
Patty:
Oh, Espella. Are you off out somewhere?
Espella:
Yes. I'm taking Mr Layton and Luke to see the Great Archive.
Patty:
Is that so? Well, you might want to hurry... it looks like it might rain at any time. Ah yes, that reminds me. Could you get me something while you're out? Just on your way back would be fine.
Espella:
Yes, of course. What can I get for you?
Patty:
Some goat's milk from Mary. I forgot to get some when I was at the market.
Espella:
Okay, I'll drop round to Mary's farm on the way back.
Patty:
Would you? There's a milk bucket ready round the back.
Luke:
Milk, you say?
Espella:
Naturally, our bakery uses only the finest goat's milk for our milk loaf. It's so fluffy and white, it's delicious!
Luke:
Cor...sounds great!
Layton:
Let's be certain to try some later, Luke.
Luke:
I'm totally up for that!

Luke:
It looks like the knights have given up searching for us, thank goodness.
Layton:
Yes, it seems you're right, Luke. From the look of things, we should be safe to explore a little more before making our way to the Great Archive.
A new destination has been added to the map: Great Archive Entrance.
Great Archive Entrance
Espella:
Here we are, this is the Great Archive.
Luke:
Wow! It looked impressive even from a distance, but now we're here up close, it's huge! Just looking up at it makes my neck ache.
Layton:
It must have taken considerable time and manpower to erect a building of this size.
Espella:
Yes, it did. This building has become something of a symbol for the town.
Luke:
Huh? Hey, look at that roof over there... It looks like it's suffered considerable fire damage at some point. Was there a major fire or something?
Espella:
Ah, that... That was...
???:
I've been listening for a while, and must say, you two really are strange.
Luke:
Oh, it's you.
Petter:
That roof has been like that for some time. It's certainly nothing new.
Luke:
R-really...?
Layton:
If it's all right with you, could you tell us a little about it?
Petter:
You two never cease to amaze me, with your incredible lack of knowledge. Well, I guess it couldn't hurt to tell you. That damage is from the Legendary Fire.
Layton:
The Legendary Fire?
Petter:
Yes. Long, long ago, there was a huge fire that engulfed almost this entire town. The damage there occurred at that time. You can see other traces of the fire around the town too, here and there.
Luke:
The entire town was engulfed in a huge fire?
Petter:
All of the townsfolk know about it. You're probably the only ones that don't.
Layton:
Thank you for filling us in. That's certainly cleared up a few things.
Petter:
No problem. It so happens I had nothing better to do. It wasn't such a bad way to kill time. Anyway, I'll see you around...
Luke:
To think that even a building this size could be affected by fire... The fire that spread through the town really must have been "legendary"...
Layton:
You're certainly right about that, Luke.
Espella:

Layton:
............? Espella, is something the matter?
Espella:
...Oh! Um, no. Nothing at all. Shall we make our way inside?

Oh, yes! Something certainly is! Troubling me, I mean. Today's scary story, it's just so frightening! I may be afraid... But I have to do it! I have to finish my delivery! See this? A whole satchel full of letters! A letter-fest! And I have to deliver them all.

Oh, my...that really is a lot of letters! If you'd like, I could help by delivering a few of them for you.

Layton:

Great Archive top floor
Luke:
It looks even taller when you see it up close! I can't even see the top!
Layton:
It requires a lot of architectural knowledge to construct a building of this size.
Luke:
It makes me feel giddy just looking up at it!
Espella:
Seeing it like this, you get an idea of how monumental the Great Archive is.
Burnt roof
Luke:
This whole town had once been burned to the ground. It's hard to imagine damage on that scale.
Layton:
The entire town had to be restored afterwards. It might have looked very different from what it is now.

The symbol from the flag can be found throughout the town.

Labyrinthia seems surrounded by cliffs and woods. In the distance there's nothing but fog.

Truly remarkable... Are all of these books "stories"?
Espella:
Yes, they are...all of them. It's said that these were all written by the Storyteller.
Luke:
All of these books? But there are so many!
???:
Excuse me! Beg your pardon! Look out! Gangwaaay!
Dewey:
I've got 'em, don't worry. P-p-piece of caaake! Phew...told you! No problem.
Sorry to startle you folk. I didn't think there was anyone here.
Layton:
That's all right. It's lucky that you didn't drop any books.
Luke:
I don't think I've ever seen anyone carry so many books at once. Aren't they heavy?
Dewey:
I love books, so I feel like a mother carrying her baby. If you love books too, why not carry a few with me?
Luke:
I do love books, but I don't think I could carry that many...
Dewey:
You obviously don't understand the true enjoyment of books. Embracing books, being buried in books, the feel of books, the smell of books... Listening to the sound of the pages turning, gazing up at books piled high... Being surrounded by books and playing with them... That's how to enjoy books!
Luke:
I'm not sure I totally agree...
Espella:
Um...Dewey?
Dewey:
Eh?! Th-that voice... That's Espella, isn't it? Uh-oh! H-here we go again!
Layton:
Please, remain calm. You wouldn't want to drop those books.
Dewey:
Just leave it...to me! See, all under control.
Espella:
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you like that. Dewey, we've come here to find a book about magic.
Dewey:
M-magic?! I should have known... That is, I, uh...never mind.
Layton:
............?
Dewey:
Well, if it's magic that you're interested in, then might I suggest the Grand Grimoire?
Layton:
The Grand Grimoire, you say? We'd like to borrow that book, if we may.
Dewey:
Well, you'll need Miss Mystere's permission. Are you sure you want to borrow it...?
Luke:
Absolutely! We're very interested in magic.

Candle chandeliers on either side
Luke:
A candle chandelier. How do they light the candles?
Layton:
I would venture a guess that they light them from the second floor, with the aid of a long stick.
Luke:
Reading by candlelight can ruin your eyesight.
Espella:
Oh, I remember seeing very bright street lights in London. They were so strange.
Ridelle:
The Great Archive was founded for those in the noble pursuit of knowledge. I must ask you to be a little quieter, please. Dewey, as a budding librarian I would have thought that you would have known better...
Dewey:
I'm sorry, Miss Mystere. But these people say they want to borrow the Grand Grimoire!
Ridelle:
Did you say...the Grand Grimoire? .........! You're... ...Espella Cantabella. You of all people must know the significance of the Grand Grimoire. It is an important piece of literature which can only be viewed by learned persons of significant status. It's not like I can just give my permission to whoever asks for it, you know.
Espella:
I understand that, but this man...
Ridelle:
I'm sorry, but rules cannot be changed.
Layton:
The request is all mine. That book could prove indispensable for my investigations into magic.
Ridelle:
And you are...? Excuse me, but may I ask your name?
Layton:
I'm Hershel Layton. I'm investigating this town... You could say I'm a traveller, so to speak.
Ridelle:
A traveller? I'm afraid I have never come across such a profession... Well, I suppose we can return to that later. My name is Ridelle Mystere. I am a librarian, as well as curator of the Great Archive. And I am therefore responsible for all pieces of work here, including the Grand Grimoire. I'm afraid that no matter what your profession or who you are, it is beyond my authority to lend you the Grand Grimoire... It is simply against the rules.
Luke:
The rules...? Can't you make an exception for us?
Layton:
Luke...please, leave this to me. I can understand that you are unable to show this book to just anyone. However, as you yourself said just a moment ago, the Great Archive was founded for those in the noble pursuit of knowledge. And I am currently very much in the pursuit of knowledge regarding magic. Perhaps you would consider letting me at least peruse the Grand Grimoire?
Ridelle:
Only learned persons of significant status, and in particular, inquisitors, are permitted to refer to the Grand Grimoire.
Layton:
Inquisitors...?
Ridelle:
Those who administer justice in this town. Knights of wisdom, as they are known. Only somebody with equal status to that of an inquisitor, or with the same level of wisdom, would qualify.
Layton:
So if I could demonstrate the required level of wisdom, then I would qualify?
Ridelle:
You certainly are a persistent gentleman. Very well, let's see what you make of a trial. This trial has been used in the past to test the ability of aspiring inquisitors. If you are able to clear this trial, then I will acknowledge that your wisdom matches that of an inquisitor. If you can achieve this, then as curator of the Great Archive, I will lend you that book.
Layton:
Splendid! Then by all means, do begin.
Ridelle:
You certainly have some confidence. Let's see if you can live up to it. Do you think you can pass this trial, at which so many hopefuls have stumbled? See what you can do with this!

Ridelle:
............ Not so fast! Do you really believe that my permission can be obtained as easily as that? That was no more than a preliminary trial, to separate the wheat from the chaff. Now for the real trial. Even a man of your calibre should find this challenging. This trial will have your eyes rolling and your head spinning!

Ridelle:
That's better. I apologise...for a moment there, I lost my composure. But to see my trial cleared like that... It seems I underestimated you, sir.
Layton:
It was a fascinating puzzle. No more than I'd expect from the curator of the Great Archive.
Ridelle:
I find your confidence rather disconcerting... I hope someday to have the pleasure of showing you a puzzle that will make those little round eyes of yours spin in your head! But nevertheless, a promise is a promise. I hereby grant you your permission. The special viewing room containing the Grand Grimoire is located on the first floor. As I'm sure you are already aware, that book is of unparalleled importance. By no means may it be treated with anything but the utmost care.
Layton:
Of course, Miss Mystere. Thank you for granting me permission.
Ridelle:
Well then, shall we proceed to the special viewing room? I shall have to accompany you, since the room is locked.
Luke:
You did it, Professor! You cleared both trials in one fell swoop!
Espella:
That was amazing, Mr Layton! It's well known that Miss Mystere is an avid collector of puzzles. And I've heard that the puzzles she presents are always very difficult to solve!
Layton:
I see...so there are collectors of puzzles in this place, too...
Espella:
......? What do you mean?
Layton:
Oh, nothing important. Right then, no use in waiting around. Let's go and take a look at the Grand Grimoire!

Luke:
This is incredible! It's crammed with information about magic.
Espella:
People say it's the magic used by the witches.
Luke:
If that's so, then the magic we saw in London must be in here somewhere too.
Layton:
That may well be true, Luke. A tome as thick as this must surely contain such information.
Luke:
Finding it is a bit daunting, though... Huh, what's this? Professor, this page is different from the others...
Layton:
What is this...?
Luke:
This page isn't about magic at all... Something about it makes me feel uneasy.
Layton:
............! Luke, this page...it appears to be addressed to someone, don't you think?
Luke:
Oh... You mean like a message...? Let's read it, Professor!
From a time long ago, The ancient flame has been locked, In an infinite vault of books.Waiting for the awakening, When the sun and moon, Watching over the sage, Swap places to show their true form,The door to the past will open. Once a person of perspicacity has fulfilled the challenge, The door will be open. Until then I will wait, For the time of the awakening.
Luke:
Wh-what is this?!
Ridelle:
How...can this be? Why is this in here...? How did something like this get into the Grand Grimoire?! It's just not possible... I can't understand it. No one entered the special viewing room before you came here... And whenever someone enters this room, I always accompany them in this way.
Espella:
So...that means that the page must have changed at some point...doesn't it?
Layton:
............
Luke:
Could that really be possible?! Perhaps with some kind of device...
Ridelle:
Unthinkable! There is only one key to this room, so no one can enter without being granted my permission. I assure you it's true, on my honour as a curator.
Luke:
But then...how can anyone have done this?
Layton:
Luke, I believe we both know who might be capable of such an act.
Luke:
Eh...?
Espella:
You mean, witches...don't you?
Luke:
W-witches...
Layton:
............ We don't know yet who changed that page, but the more important matter... is what's written here. The "infinite vault of books" mentioned here presumably refers to the Great Archive. Which implies there is a secret of some sort hidden within the library.
Luke:
Professor, what about this part: "a person of pers, perspi...perspicacity"...?
Layton:
Well, I believe that could be referring to Carmine.
Espella:
He came here regularly to investigate.
Layton:
So it's certainly somewhat likely. Which means our next objective... is to find the answer that he was looking for.
Luke:
It's a bit of a spooky message... But if we can open this "door to the past", then we'll surely be one step closer to solving this mystery!
Ridelle:
Just a moment, please... I'm the curator here. And I won't be allowing you to investigate anything without my permission.
Luke:
S-so you mean we can't investigate...?
Ridelle:
Not at all. I'm simply insisting that you allow me to accompany you. There should be no doors in this library that I don't know about. And even if there is something hidden somewhere, as suggested by this message, it is my duty as curator to know what that is.
Layton:
I completely understand, Miss Mystere. We can only benefit from your presence. Now then, how about we all make our way back to the entrance? Let's think about where this door could be from there.
Great Archive
Luke:
But, Professor, supposing there is a door, that message is such a puzzle in itself... don't you think it'll be difficult to find?
Espella:
You may be right. And this library is so large... Finding anything will surely take a good deal of our time.
Layton:
No, I think not. You're both missing something here. I believe I may well know what is meant by the words in the message.
Luke:
Eh? Really, Professor?!
Layton:
Yes. If you'll just remember the wording...
"From a time long ago, The ancient flame has been locked, In an infinite vault of books,Waiting for the awakening. When the sun and moon, Watching over the sage, Swap places to show their true form,The door to the past will open. Once a person of perspicacity has fulfilled the challenge, The door will be open. Until then I will wait, For the time of the awakening."
Layton:
If you'll both take a look around this room, you'll notice we are surrounded by books. There is probably nowhere else in the library with more books than there are right here.
Luke:
There are books extending all the way up. We're completely surrounded by them.
Layton:
And the key to opening this door is in the "sun and moon watching over the sage".
Luke:
But what could that mean...?
Espella:
There are no windows, so no light can come in from the sun or the moon.
Layton:
Precisely! Which means it is not the real sun and moon that are being referred to here. And they are located where they can "watch over" the sage. In other words, behind. Perhaps you have already realised to whom "the sage" is referring...? Right then, let's find this "sun and moon watching over the sage" and open the door!

Dewey:
Of course I haven't been in there! What are you saying, Miss Mystere? You always say that if anyone goes in there without permission, they'll have to solve 100 of your puzzles as punishment! If I had to solve that many puzzles, I'd go insane!
Ridelle:
That's pitiful! If you ever even considered becoming a librarian, I'd expect that much of you.
Statues on either side
Espella:
It feels so sophisticated! I bet we'll find something here!
Luke:
But the riddle mentions the sun and the moon. Where are they?
Espella:
Oh, maybe I was wrong then...

Candle chandeliers on either side
Luke:
I wonder if this has got something to do with the sun in that message we just saw.
Espella:
But there's nothing remotely resembling the moon in sight.
Luke:
Ah! What's that...?!
Espella:
It's a sun and moon construction... Oh!
Luke:
So the "sage" must be...
Layton:
That's right, the sage of this library refers to the curator. And this sun and moon construction is located right behind her seat... So that's what the "sun and moon watching over the sage" was referring to.
Luke:
And when the sun and moon swap places, their true form will be shown... and the door to the past will open. So all we need to do is work out what that means...
Espella:
But what does it mean by "their true form"?
Layton:
Hmm...well, if we interpret it at face value, it would suggest that we are currently seeing their untrue form. ............Hmm? Have a look at this. There seems to be some sort of mechanism in place.
Luke:
Ah! Professor! If you look closely, there seems to be a puzzle hidden here.

Ridelle:
That's right... And if I, the curator, knew nothing of it, then surely no one else could. It's hard to believe that a secret such as this could have been hidden here all this time. Who could have possibly left such a message...?

I am intrigued. If we could only know what is written here...
Espella:
I am not familiar with this script either... I'm sorry that I cannot help.
Rubble on left
Luke:
The ceiling around here caved in...
Layton:
The walls have gone brittle, too. It may be dangerous to stay here too long.
Luke:
I hope this cellar isn't going to collapse...
Luke:
This wall painting is a bit scary, isn't it? A monster attacking a burning town...
Layton:
There's also a woman hurling fire. I suppose she must be a witch...?
Ridelle:
That woman is the Great Witch.
Layton:
Miss Mystere?
Ridelle:
This certainly doesn't bode well, a painting of the Great Witch here...
Layton:
Do you know anything about the witch in this painting?
Ridelle:
You don't know of the Great Witch? But how can that be possible for a man of your learning?
Layton:
Well, that's...
Ridelle:
Never mind. I'm sure you must have your reasons. I don't wish to pry.
Layton:
I appreciate that. Would you mind perhaps telling us a bit about this witch?
Ridelle:
The woman in this painting... is the Great Witch Bezella. And this painting depicts the infamous Legendary Fire that she caused.
Layton:
The Legendary Fire...
Ridelle:
She is the witch in charge of all witches, whose very existence poses the greatest threat known to Labyrinthia. The Great Witch Bezella cannot be considered the same as other witches... She is the root of all Labyrinthia's woes.
Layton:
............ The Great Witch Bezella...
What do you mean by the root of all Labyrinthia's woes?
Ridelle:
The reason for all of Labyrinthia's suffering at the hands of witches, lies in the very existence of the Great Witch Bezella.
Layton:
Would you mind elaborating...?
Ridelle:
The Great Witch Bezella is the source of all the other witches. As long as she exists, there will be no end to other witches. While the Great Witch Bezella is with us, the townspeople will forever live in fear under the shadow of witches.
Luke:
So you mean that if there were no Great Witch, there would be peace?
Ridelle:
No Great Witch? That's easy enough to say... But while all of the knights have been searching for Bezella, nobody has ever been able to find her. There are very few clues, and no one has ever seen her in person. Nevertheless, the Great Witch Bezella is undoubtedly present in Labyrinthia.
Layton:
How can you be so certain?
Ridelle:
Because her deep claw marks can still be seen throughout the town.
Luke:
"Claw marks"...?
Ridelle:
You must all have seen them too. The traces of that fire, when you entered this library.
Layton:
Ah, yes. There was a part of this building that had suffered noticeable damage.
Ridelle:
Bezella is a fearful witch, who has all other witches doing her bidding. Long ago...this town was reduced to ashes as a result of her fiery magic.
Luke:
Reduced...to ashes?
Ridelle:
That must have been...let me see...a hundred or so years ago. It was on the evening of the fire festival, held every year in honour of the Great Witch Bezella. The Great Witch's fury was unleashed without warning, as the entire town burned.
Layton:
That's terrible...
Ridelle:
That was the Legendary Fire... Every person in this town knows about it.
Layton:
The Legendary Fire...
Ridelle:
The rebuilding of the town was a long and arduous process. And all the while, Bezella must have been watching and laughing from the shadows.
Luke:
That's awful...
Ridelle:
Even now, the legend of long ago... continues to cause real suffering amongst the townsfolk. To think that a painting of that fearful witch could be right here in the basement of my beloved library! What is it doing here, of all places?!
Layton:
............
Ridelle:
There's nothing for it...I'll just have to have this room sealed shut. Please, let's keep the existence of this room strictly between ourselves. For the good of the people. As for me, I shall do my best to forget all about this hidden room... ...I'm afraid I'd rather not remain in here a minute longer. ...It's time I started closing up the library for the day.
Luke:
I can't help but feel we've done something wrong.
Layton:
Luke...do you recall the words towards the end of that message?
Luke:
Do you mean "until then I will wait"...?
Layton:
That's right. When we opened this door... or rather, when we were guided towards opening this door, I could sense someone else's will at work. It's almost as if our following Carmine and coming to this library, had all been planned out in advance.
Luke:
Surely you don't mean...that we were beckoned here by the Great Witch Bezella?!
Layton:
............
Espella:
............Bezella............
Anime cutscene
Layton:
Is something the matter? Are you feeling all right, Espella?
Espella:
Yes, I'm fine, really.
Espella:
............
Luke:
Um, Espella...?
Espella:
Ah...I, uh...yes? What is it?
Luke:
It's just that...well, you've been so quiet...
Espella:
Oh, it's nothing... It's just that, this room... It's a little chilly, don't you think?
Luke:
The atmosphere is a bit sinister. Not to mention that scary picture... Maybe it's about time we made a move from here?
Layton:
Yes, indeed. ............ Those words at the end of the message... ............"I will wait"............ What if...we weren't meant to be the ones being called here...?
NEW MYSTERY
Underground Mural
Hidden beneath the Great Archive were ancient remains in which was enshrined an ominous wall painting depicting the town being consumed by fire. When was this painting created, and by whom?
Was it by chance that we found this wall painting, or were we in fact led to it by someone?
MYSTERY SOLVED
Investigation
Carmine had been visiting the Great Archive to investigate one of Labyrinthia's secrets. That secret being the ancient remains found hidden in a room beneath the library.
Who would have thought that the secret Carmine was after was the mural of the Great Witch Bezella under the library.
Great Archive
Luke:
Phew, it's much more relaxing here, isn't it? It felt so intense and claustrophobic down there.
Espella:
Yes, it certainly did... Today has been full of surprises. Not only did I meet up with you two again, but we also found that mural in the library. It seems that this town really does hold a mysterious secret, doesn't it? What shall we do now?
Layton:
Hmm...I'd certainly like to learn more about this magic. We've been in here for quite some time. It must be getting late. It's probably best if we wind up our investigating for today and take a rest. You must both be feeling tired.
Espella:
Yes, I suppose you're right. I'd be happy to do a little more investigating with you two, but I have an errand to run before it gets too late.
Luke:
I'm still up for investigating further! Whatever the puzzle, I'm ready to solve it!
Espella:
Ha ha! Luke, I could hear your tummy rumbling from here just now!
Luke:
Well, I can't pretend I'm not a little hungry...
Espella:
If you haven't arranged accommodation yet, why don't you both stay at the bakery? There is a room free, so I'm sure it'd be all right. And Mrs Eclaire would love to have you. What do you say...?
Layton:
Well, if you put it like that, we'd be delighted to stay. Thank you, Espella.
Luke:
And there's all that delicious bread, too! Mmmm, I'm looking forward to it already!
Ridelle:
Professor Layton, do you have to be going?
Layton:
Yes. Sorry for all the trouble we put you to.
Ridelle:
Not at all. Although I still can't get used to there being a secret room under the library. It's been a while since I last met someone capable of solving my puzzles. And as I promised, you have my permission to borrow the Grand Grimoire. If you have any need for it in the future, please do drop by and let me know.
Layton:
Thank you very much, Miss Mystere. It's been a pleasure.
Ridelle:
Oh...there is just one more thing. I have all of Labyrinthia's puzzles stored here in this library. As you continue with your investigations here in Labyrinthia, there will likely be puzzles that you cannot solve or which you do not find. Such puzzles will come to me. Any time you wish to solve such puzzles, just visit me and I will show them to you.
Layton:
Puzzles that we cannot solve or do not find, you say? Very well. Then I look forward to seeing you again.
Ridelle:
I'll be waiting. Please take care on your way home. It's already become dark out there. And...if I remember rightly, the Storyteller's latest story did mention the evening...
Layton:
............ You take care, too. Until we meet again, Miss Mystere.
Grand Grimoire added to Items.
Great Archive Entrance
Luke:
Wow! It's already this dark out here... I didn't realise we were in there so long.
Layton:
It looks as if it must have been raining up until a moment ago. The ground is still wet.
Luke:
Yes, and that reminds me of what Mrs Eclaire was saying before we left... She said: "you might want to hurry... it looks like it might rain at any time." Let's get a move on! You too, Espella...... Hey, where is she?
Layton:
That's strange...she's not here.
Luke:
I wonder where she could have gone...
Layton:
Perhaps she's still in the Great Archive...
Dewey:
Slowly does it, step by step... Oh...are you two still here? Can you let me through? I have to lock up.
Luke:
Hello, Dewey. Have you seen Espella?
Dewey:
If you're looking for Espella, she left while you were still talking to Miss Mystere.
Luke:
Eh? I wonder why...
Dewey:
She said something about having to buy some milk. Even though it was still raining...
Layton:
Ah, yes. I do remember Mrs Eclaire asking her to get some milk for the bakery.
Luke:
It was raining...you said?
Dewey:
Yes. It started raining about the time you all went down into that library basement. When Espella left just now, it did look as if the rain was about to stop. Ah, yes! She left a message for you. She said to go back without her.
Luke:
But she didn't have to go alone! Especially in the dark...
Dewey:
I'm sure she'll be fine. If it's only milk she needs, then she can get it at the market. It's not far, so she should be back soon. If anything, I'd be more worried about you two being the ones in danger. You, know, in the Story, it said there were "two companions".
Layton:
............
Dewey:
If your work here is finished, then I suggest you both go home. I don't want to get caught up in anything!
Layton:
Luke...why don't we head back to the bakery and wait for Espella there?
Luke:
I suppose so. I guess she'll be all right...right?
Examine
Great Archive top floor
Luke:
It looks even taller when you see it up close! I can't even see the top!
Layton:
It requires a lot of architectural knowledge to construct a building of this size.
Luke:
It makes me feel giddy just looking up at it!
Burnt roof
Layton:
This seems to be related to the mural we saw in the Great Archive cellar.
Luke:
The librarian said the fire was caused by a fire dragon summoned by Bezella, the Great Witch.
Labyrinthian coat-of-arms flag on right
Luke:
Those symbols were in the Great Archive, too.
Layton:
These flags serve to constantly remind the townspeople that their creator is watching them.
Luke:
It's a bit unsettling, although I can't really say why.
Archway on right
Luke:
Labyrinthia seems surrounded by cliffs and woods. In the distance there's nothing but fog.
Layton:
The fog is so thick, I can't see far.
Luke:
This place looks so mysterious, surrounded by the misty forest.

Tuggit
Tuggit:
No-no-no, no-no-no. It's...pitch black! I can't go home when it's so dark!
Luke:
I don't think it's so dark, with all these lights around.
Tuggit:
Lights...yes, that's right. The lights... I'm having trouble with the lights in my house. It's sooooo dark in there!

...If it's as bright as this, then I've nothing to worry about. So bright that I can even tell it's my house from afar... Shining so very brightly... No...no-no-no, no-no-no! It can't be sooooo bright... If my house is THAT bright, it's bound to get noticed by the witch! ...And then I'll be doomed!
Tuggit (subsequent times)
Tuggit:
The witch will appear... I'm doomed!
First floor windows in house on closer left
Luke:
It's bright here even after dusk.
Layton:
Perhaps the light helps dispel Labyrinthians' fear of the witches.
Luke:
Is it just my imagination, or are there fewer people around? Have they all gone home because of that story?
Great Archive
Luke:
The opposite side is not very well lit, so it's hard to see anything from here.
Layton:
The Great Archive, towering above us against the dark skies, looks truly imposing.
Luke:
At night, it looks more like a place to test your courage at rather than read books.
Third floor windows in house on closer right
Layton:
Unlike in the other parts of the town, buildings here are tall and magnificent.
Luke:
It looks quite posh.
Layton:
Many of the houses have shops on the ground floor and living quarters above.

Cinderellia
Cinderellia:
Francesca, Anna, Lillian... My dear friends. I am ever so sad... Soon, the four of us will be forced to part ways.
Layton:
Hmm...? This is the pawnbroker's shop, isn't it? What seems to be the matter?
Cinderellia:
Oh, my. Is that concern in your voice, oh gentle sir? If you have but a moment, allow me to explain my ever so woesome woe... The family coffers are not brimming with coin as they once were, I'm afraid...so I've come to sell my ever so dearest friends.
Luke:
Sell...your friends?!
Layton:
Indeed, and lifelong friends at that!
Cinderellia:
Oh, indeed, gentle sir. However, my friends are ever so picky about where they stay. ...Pray, would you be able to put them into their proper rooms?

Oh, thank you, gentle sirs! With my friends all in their place, I'm sure to get ever such a fair price... And I'm sure they will be ever so happy in their new homes.
Luke:
Wait, did we do that for your friends, or for the price...?
Cinderellia:
Tell me, Mr Pawnbroker, will you take ever such good care of my friends now?
Price:
Madam, I realise you have brought your friends a long way to visit me, but I'm afraid a dolls' house like this... is a little out of my line.
Cinderellia:
........................
Price:
Okay, okay, you win! I'll take them off your hands!
Cinderellia:
Hee hee! Wonderful! Thank you ever so much, Mr Pawnbroker.
Luke:
She might be laughing, but I could certainly sense the tension in that transaction.
Layton:
A haughty laugh of authority, perhaps...
Cinderellia (subsequent times)
Cinderellia:
Because of your help, I can now afford to buy brand new friends to keep me company. Keeping up with the fashion scene for dolls is ever so difficult when one is so far away from the rich comforts of the castle.
Streetlamp
Layton:
Few lights are on at night around here, giving this place a very different atmosphere.
Luke:
These are some fancy street lights. What's that burning inside?
Layton:
London street lights used to be powered by gas, but that is not the case here.
Blacksmith vendor
Luke:
You can hear hammer strikes even at night.
Layton:
He may have received an urgent order. You can tell from the sound that he's very keen on the work.
Luke:
The town feels somewhat desolate at night, so seeing shops like this brightens up the mood a little.
Town Centre
Examine
Knight-on-horseback statue
Luke:
The fountain looks marvellous illuminated by the lights.
Layton:
They don't seem to use electricity for light. There must be torches on the inside of the trough at the base.
Luke:
The statue has a different air about it at night.
Top of barrel
Luke:
The cat that was here earlier has gone off somewhere.
Layton:
It might have gone for a patrol around its territory.
Luke:
Cats sleep so much during the day that they're full of energy at night.
Shop billboard
Layton:
It doesn't seem to be open for business at night, either.
Luke:
The lights are on upstairs, but maybe the shopkeeper's unwell?
Layton:
We should put our time to better use than waiting for this shop to open. Let us go back.

Mailer
Mailer:
Uh-oh... Not good! What shall I do?
Layton:
What's the matter? Is something troubling you, madam?
Mailer:
Oh, yes! Something certainly is! Troubling me, I mean. Today's story is just so frightening!
Luke:
You mean the story with the witch? So you're afraid too?
Mailer:
Well, duh! Of course I'm afraid! But...I'm the courier. And that means one thing! My post will ALWAYS be delivered! No exceptions. No matter what.
Luke:
Courier...I guess that's like a postwoman, right?
Mailer:
I wouldn't know about that. I just deliver these letters. To the townspeople. But now, everyone's afraid. So no one's going out. And so...there are way more than usual! Letters, I mean. Letters that need delivering!
Layton:
We'd be delighted to offer our help. Is there some way that we could lend you a hand...?
Mailer:
Thank you for the offer! But there's nothing you can do. Delivering letters is my responsibility, you see.
Luke:
Wow, that's impressive. Even at a time like this, you're putting your work first.
Mailer:
Well, I suppose. But you know what? I can't help but think... If only there were something I could ride... That would make it so much easier! The delivery, I mean.

It doesn't look as inviting after dark.
Layton:
It's a bit dark here, so mind your step.

It's dark inside. I don't think anyone's there, Professor.
Layton:
There is something unsettling about the sight of the tall bell tower, piercing the dark skies.

Flickering lights reveal guards standing at the entrance.

Is this an important building?
Town Square Outskirts

Door on left building

The windows are closed, but the first floor lights are on.

Very few people are out and about at this hour. Streets empty out as night sets in.
Luke:
Witches found their way even into the professor's office! Doors and shutters won't keep them out.
Fountain
Layton:
It's a water fountain. The water looks very clear. It may be suitable for drinking.
Luke:
There must be a spring somewhere nearby.
Crates on left
Layton:
A pile of discarded wooden crates.
Luke:
They're just crates. Nothing to see.
E. Shopping Area
Luke:
Professor, I smell freshly baked bread! I wonder if that could be Mrs Eclaire's work. Let's go inside!
Layton:
Hmm...yes, we could. Although we could also take a walk around the town at night... If there's nothing else you'd particularly like to see, perhaps we should head back in.

Petter
Petter:
Evening, gents! Isn't Espella with you?
Layton:
Do you know Espella?
Petter:
Do I know her? There isn't a person in this town who doesn't know Espella.
Luke:
I didn't realise she was so famous...
Petter:
I've known some ignorant people, but you two really do take the biscuit. If you knew her better, then I doubt you'd be spending so much time with her.
Luke:
What's that supposed to mean? Espella is a lovely person... I don't know how you can say that.
Petter:
Personally, I don't enjoy talking about her in that way either...
Layton:
............
Petter (subsequent times)
Petter:
Personally, I don't enjoy talking about her in that way either... It's just that I wanted to warn you to take care when associating with her.
Butcher
Layton:
There's a butcher next to the fishmonger. It's still open.
Luke:
Extended opening hours? That's convenient. Do you think they take pounds and pennies?
Layton:
I think we've all got a bit hungry. We seem to be noticing only food.
Seafood vendor
Luke:
Ooooh! Phosphorescent anglerfish!
Layton:
And that would be octopus over there. It looks belligerent and ready to spray the potential buyer with ink.
Luke:
They've sold out of most of their products today.
Empty trays on right

Labyrinthian books...interesting. I would like to read some when we have time.

They're all very thick. It would take you some time to read them, Professor.

Wow, it looks great!
Maya:
Hang on...where's Espella?
Layton:
I'm afraid we were separated when she went to get that milk. Has she not come back yet?
Patty:
Oh, dear. Maybe I was asking too much of her...
Layton:
My apologies. I should have stopped her, had I had the chance.
Patty:
It's nothing you need to worry about, Mr Layton! That girl knows her way around. I'm sure she'll be back soon. Let's go ahead and eat while waiting for her.
Maya:
I love it when we all get to eat together. Meals are much more enjoyable that way!
Luke:
I've never had bread and jam that tasted this good before!
Phoenix:
I hope Espella gets back soon...
Maya:
Oh, yeah! You guys went out to the Great Archive with her, didn't you?
Phoenix:
Did you find what you were looking for?
Layton:
Well...it's a bit of a mystery, really.
Phoenix:
...What do you mean?
Layton:
In truth, we went there to investigate the mystery that is Labyrinthia. However, what we found instead was quite the puzzle.
Phoenix:
Oh, right... A "puzzle", huh...
Maya:
You know, I get the impression puzzles are pretty popular in this town. Do you not know what a puzzle is, Nick?! Not that I know exactly...
Phoenix:
Well, we spend all our time baking... It's not really the kind of thing we're supposed to know about, I guess.
Layton:
Indeed, it appears the two of you are a little unsure about the concept of puzzles.
Maya:
Say, Mr Layton... Do you think you could give us a little "Puzzles 101" crash course? I'm kinda curious.
Layton:
It would be my pleasure, Miss Fey. But rather than explaining it in words, I believe actually trying your hand at a puzzle would be far more rewarding. Here, I'll give you both a simple example to think about. Now then, here we have two long loaves of bread placed side by side. You'll notice that they form the number 11. Do you see what I mean?
Maya:
Oh, yeah... I get it! So that's what a puzzle is!
Layton:
Not quite, Miss Fey. The puzzle is what follows next. What I'd like you to try is... I'd like you to see if you can change this into a number lower than 11.
Phoenix:
A lower number...? So how about if I take one of the loaves?
Layton:
However, the one condition is that you must add another loaf of exactly the same type.
Maya:
You need to add... another loaf?! Even though we add a loaf, the number has to be lower... I think I'm beginning to see what you mean by "puzzle"!
Phoenix:
............ Wait, I think I've got it! I may just be a baker, but I bet I have the right answer! If I place the extra loaf sideways like this, then one minus one equals zero!
Maya:
Oh gimme a break, Nick! That's totally the letter H. We're trying to solve a puzzle here, not win a spelling bee!
Phoenix:
Oh, c'mon...I can't be the ONLY one that sees one minus one, right? ...Right?
Layton:
Turning it into a matter of arithmetic is certainly an interesting approach.
Phoenix:
You, uhhh...think so?
Layton:
Most certainly. That's precisely the kind of flexible thinking needed for solving puzzles. Now, let's think again.
Maya:
Take a seat and leave this to a pro, Nick. How about...this?! You just take this new loaf and...TA-DA! Now THAT's one minus one!
Phoenix:
Hey! Eating is cheating!
Maya:
Really? Because it feels more like winning to me.
Layton:
You're full of surprises, Miss Fey. I didn't expect that kind of innovation.
Maya:
I solved the puzzle AND enjoyed the bread! Win-win, baby!
Phoenix:
But... didn't Mr Layton tell us at the start that we need to add another loaf of the exact same type?
Maya:
Huh? Seriously?
Layton:
That's right, unfortunately. I'm afraid I can't accept this as a solution to the puzzle.
Maya:
Well, all right, but... Is there really another better solution?
Layton:
Well, what do you think? Can either of you think of a different solution?
Phoenix:
I'm drawing a blank... I guess this kind of thing just isn't for me.
Layton:
You both came up with such creative answers, I'm sure you'll be solving puzzles in no time. But now, it's time for the solution. The important thing in this puzzle's solution, is the angle of the loaf that is added. If the new loaf is placed upright, like so...
Maya:
Oh, I get it! It's the number 1.1, right?
Phoenix:
Hey, that's right! That's a lot lower than eleven...
Layton:
Exactly. When solving puzzles, there is never just one correct method. It's essential to think flexibly and try many means to solve it. Sometimes critical thinking is the key to success.
Phoenix:
...Right. I see what you mean. These puzzles are really something else.
Maya:
Well...if I see another puzzle like this, I'd still rather eat my way to the solution...
Phoenix:
Hmm... You know, I don't think I'm cut out for brain-busting bread puzzles like this. I'll stick with good ol' regular bread, thanks.
Maya:
That's because we're ace bakers! I guess we're better suited to using our hands than our heads...
Layton:
Is that so? In truth, I can't help but feel you're both a little out of place as bakers, if you'll pardon my saying so. Naturally, I won't force puzzles upon you, but if either of you should be interested, I would heartily recommend giving puzzle solving a try.
Luke:
Professor, right now there's something else we all need to try... Mrs Eclaire's freshly baked bread is getting cold! And I'm sure it tastes better hot!
Layton:
Oh dear, so it is. You know how I can get when it comes to puzzles...
Patty:
Well, young man, I must say it's a pleasure to have someone show such appreciation for my baking.
Luke:
When it comes to your bread, Mrs Eclaire, there's no limit to how much I could eat!
Patty:
............!
Phoenix:
L-Luke!
Maya:
You...shouldn't have said that!
Luke:
............?
Patty:
My my, aren't you a darling! Well then, in that case, I suppose I'll just have to bring out my special reserve... Hold on a moment, I'll just go and fetch it!
Phoenix:
R-right, er...I think it's time I started preparing tomorrow's bread...
Maya:
Oh, y-yes, me too! I'm sure it must be that time already...
Layton:
............
Luke:
Professor, wh-what was that all about?!
Layton:
I'm not entirely sure...but I do seem struck by a sudden sense of impending doom...
Patty:
Sorry............ to have............ kept you............ waiting! There you go! Have at it! But be warned... I won't take kindly to any leftovers...
Luke:
Whoa... Th-this loaf! Wait...where did those two go?! Miss Maya! Mr Wright!
Layton:
...Luke, it would appear that we have been left to tackle this particular task alone...
Luke:
Phew...I'm stuffed!
Layton:
Hmm...I believe this must be the most bread I have ever eaten in my life.
Luke:
Wait a sec... I've just realised...we've finished eating, but Espella still isn't back yet.
Layton:
............ She went to the market, didn't she? Perhaps we ought to go and...
Patty:
Oh, my. Customers at this late hour...? I'm sorry, but we're closed!
Knight:
That's him! That man over there!
Captain:
So he's the one, is he...?
Patty:
Just a minute! What do you think you're doing barging in here like this?!
Captain:
Stand aside, madam! This is a matter of urgency!
Patty:
Wh-what are you going to do?!
Captain:
You there, porcupine head! You're coming with us!
Phoenix:
Huh? P-porcupine head...? You don't mean...me, do you?
Captain:
Who else in this room fits that description?
Layton:
Certainly, you would appear to be alone on that particular front...
Phoenix:
Argh...I wish I had a top hat too right about now.
Captain:
Enough of your idle chit-chat! Time to get going!
Phoenix:
Huh? What do you mean?
Captain:
Well, it should be quite obvious. You're coming to the court, of course!
Phoenix:
The...court?!
Luke:
Whaaaaaa?! Mr Wright, what did you do?!
Maya:
Yeah, Nick! What did you do?!
Phoenix:
I didn't do anything! The only thing you could accuse me of is making bread that's TOO good to eat!
Captain:
Ahem! This man is not the one who's on trial.
Layton:
In that case, why is Mr Wright being made to go to the court?
Captain:
That's simple! Because the girl has requested him, of course!
Phoenix:
Girl...? What girl?!
Captain:
Naturally, the girl facing trial for this evening's crime... That heinous witch... Miss Espella Cantabella, no less!
Layton:
............!
