February 23, 9:34 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Lana:
How did the investigation go yesterday, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Frankly, there are still a lot of... gray areas.
Ema:
Or rather, the whole thing is one big gray area...
Lana:
Don't worry about me, no matter what the outcome. I'm ready to accept my fate.
Ema:
I believe in you, sis.
Lana:
Mr. Wright, let me offer you a word of advice.
Phoenix:
Yes?
Lana:
A defense attorney should never "believe" their client.
Ema:
...!
Lana:
The defendant is called to trial because they are suspected of wrongdoing! Never forget that.
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye, you... You remind me a lot of Mia. But there is one decisive difference between you and her.
Lana:
And that is?
Phoenix:
You're not a defense attorney.
Lana:
... I believe it's almost time for the trial. Good luck, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(My first trial without a Fey helping me... No one's going to bail me out this time... I'll be alone in there... So I have to discover the truth all by myself!)
Ema:
Let's do it, Mr. Wright! I'll be with you the whole way!
February 23, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... I haven't been in court since Edgeworth's trial... It's been a while now.)
Edgeworth:
I hope that personal feelings will not be a part of the proceedings today, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
I will choose the path I think is right, regardless of what those around me might say. The judgment to be made here is in our hands, not those of anyone else.
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement please.
Edgeworth:
Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye has committed an unpardonable crime. Not only this, but she was rash enough to commit it in the Prosecutor's Office lot!
Ema:
Wow... He's much more forceful in person. I suddenly feel like confessing to everything!
Edgeworth:
However, she will now pay for her rashness with her life. There was a witness to her crime... A "professional" witness!
Judge:
Well then, call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls its first witness, Ms. Angel Starr, to the stand.
Phoenix:
(The "Cough-up Queen"...?)
Judge:
Hmm? Haven't I seen you somewhere...?
Angel:
You ordered the Caviar Lunch, right?
Judge:
Ho ho! Caviar! I've never eaten caviar before!
Phoenix:
(The judge is really wolfing it down...)
Angel:
Ah, and for you... I have a Fiesta Bowl.
Phoenix:
Uh... thanks.
Edgeworth:
Will the witness state her name and profession?
Angel:
Ah, and you, sir... Did you order "The Fingerprint" lunchbox?
Edgeworth:
It is too early for lunch. Your name and profession, please.
Angel:
... Well, Your Honor? How does it taste?
Judge:
So this is why everyone raves about caviar! It's so tasty it hurts! I always thought caviar would taste like pickled tapioca.
Phoenix:
(What the heck does pickled tapioca taste like!?)
Edgeworth:
Name. Profession. Now.
Angel:
Me? The name is Angel Starr. Don't go forgetting it. I find myself running Lunchland these days. Is... that what you wanted me to say, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Very well, witness. Please describe the incident to us.
Judge:
The prosecution will wait! I'm not finished eating...
Phoenix:
(Hurry it up!)
Judge:
Mmmm... Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. As you know, we usually call on the police to provide a description of the crime...
Angel:
Your Honor, as Mr. Edgeworth has said to the court... I am a... "professional."
Judge:
Uh... Huh? What exactly does that mean?
Edgeworth:
Until two years ago, Ms. Angel Starr was a special investigator with the police. She was a first-rate homicide detective.
Ema:
Wh-whaaaat!? Ms. Starr was a detective!?
Judge:
... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-hah! I-I know who you are!!! Cough-up...!?
Angel:
Cough-up Queen Angel Starr, Your Honor. Long time no see.
Judge:
V-v-very well! Y-you may continue with the description, Ms. Starr!
Phoenix:
(Just who is this lady!?)
Angel:
If I might have the court's attention over here... The parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office is divided into two blocks. A Block is for the Prosecutor's Office personnel. B Block is for visitors and clients... A chain divider separates the two blocks.
Judge:
I suppose that's to keep visitors from taking up prosecutor's spaces, yes.
Angel:
The crime took place by a car in the back of A Block, in the car's trunk. The killer stabbed the victim with a knife and went to drive the body out. Unfortunately for her there was a witness, and an arrest was made on the spot.
Judge:
And who was this valiant "witness"...?
Angel:
Why, it was me, Your Honor.
Floor Plans added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Witness, did you see the very moment of the crime?
Angel:
Of course, Your Honor. Immediately after that, I apprehended the Chief Prosecutor.
Judge:
Hmm... It seems rather cut and dry, doesn't it? Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Uh... I can't agree on principle, Your Honor.
Angel:
It seems that some poor losers are unwilling to accept the truth, Your Honor. Shall I proceed to crush what little hope they have remaining?
Judge:If you can... Then give them your worst, Ms. Starr!
Phoenix:
(Wait, are they talking about me...!?)
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
Angel:
Somehow, I always knew a day like this would come.
I was on my way to deliver a lunchbox to my boyfriend...
When I sensed something... perhaps it was my finely-honed detective instincts working.
Then, through a wire fence, I saw the chief prosecutor standing next to a garish car.
The chief prosecutor was holding a knife in her right hand....
Then, she thrust the pointy tip of the knife into Detective Goodman's chest!
Judge:
Hmm... Bringing a lunchbox to your boyfriend? How touching!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. As you can see... There is no room for doubt.
Judge:
The key "point" of your testimony seems to be nothing other than... the point of the knife which you saw being stabbed into Detective Goodman!
Angel:
So... how does it feel to be so utterly crushed?
Phoenix:
I... I'm still thinking about that.
Ema:
I-it's merely a flesh wound, Mr. Wright!
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.
Cross Examination
-- Witness's Account --
Angel:
Somehow, I always knew a day like this would come.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How did you know!?
Angel:
I respect the prosecutors' basic abhorrence of crime. Yet their methods are ugly and twisted. Twisted methods will always lead to tragedy.
Edgeworth:
The lunchlady's uninformed opinion is duly noted.
Angel:
Given that they are used to erasing inconvenient evidence at their whim... Killing off a detective that knew too much is merely an extension of that.
Edgeworth:
...
Ema:
Ms. Starr... do you have something personal against prosecutors?
Angel:
I felt that I had found my dream job when I became an investigator... And if I hadn't been laid off by those prosecutors over there, I'd still be one.
Phoenix:
Laid off...? (She was fired...)
Angel:
To me, prosecutors are nothing more than worms. That said, I am a pro, as you know. My testimony is unbiased... and flawless.
Judge:
Very well. You may continue, Ms. Starr.
Angel:
I was on my way to deliver a lunchbox to my boyfriend...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
This boyfriend... he's the detective?
Angel:
Not that boyfriend. The security guard.
Judge:
Th-"that" boyfriend? You have... several?
Angel:
Yes. "This" boyfriend, "that" boyfriend, and "the other" boyfriend. Care to join? The "yet another" boyfriend position is still open for applicants.
Judge:
... I-I'll stick with the lunch, thanks.
Ema:
Note to self: the judge had to think before replying.
Angel:
The security guard room is in the lot, in A Block. It's up on the second level so you can see everything from there.
Phoenix:
(That would be the room with the "SECURITY" sign.) Incidentally, did you bring your lunchboxes by car?
Angel:
Since I'm a visitor now, I parked in B Block.
Ema:
So... she was in B Block when she witnessed the crime.
Angel:
When I sensed something... perhaps it was my finely-honed detective instincts working.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You "sensed" something? So, you're saying you had a premonition of the murder?
Angel:
It felt like... how would you say... Oh yes... It was like the feeling you get when you view a pumpkin chock full of seeds!
Judge:
I have no idea what that means.
Phoenix:
Speaking of a "detective's instincts"... Wasn't the victim, Mr. Bruce Goodman, also a detective?
Angel:
Yes, well, he was like a young cheese.
Judge:
A... young cheese?
Angel:
A pale white cheese, not yet tangy with experience on the streets. A greenhorn.
Judge:
Hmm... I, of course, am hard, yellowed, sharp as a tack.
Ema:
I bet you stink, too.
Angel:
In any case, there, in the lot, I felt something stirring in the back of my mind...
Angel:
Then, through a wire fence, I saw the chief prosecutor standing next to a garish car.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
By "garish car," you mean...
Angel:
Mr. Edgeworth's car, yes.
Judge:
M-Mr. Edgeworth's!?
Angel:
Incidentally, the knife with which the victim was stabbed was also Mr. Edgeworth's. Wasn't it?
Edgeworth:
... Indeed, it was.
Judge:
Hmm! What an odd case this is. And the person you saw... you are sure it was the defendant?
Angel:
I saw her from no further than thirty feet away. I am certain it was her.
Before obtaining Crime Photo
Phoenix:
(If she's telling the truth, we're doomed!)
Ema:
Let's just do what we can! Even if we don't have any proof, we can always complain!* (Let's just do what we can! Even if we don't have any proof, we can always nitpick! in the Trilogy release)
Before pressing first statement
Phoenix:
We're dealing with Edgeworth here... I need better material before I start pressing this.
Judge:
Hmm... Can you tell us what the suspect was doing when you saw her?
After pressing first statement
Leads to:
"Witness! In your testimony, you clearly stated the following:"
Phoenix:
Witness! In your testimony, you clearly stated the following: Prosecutors are nothing more than worms. Ergo! You are a biased witness!
Angel:
You might want to keep those silly opinions to YOURSELF in the future, rookie.
Phoenix:
Huh? Rookie?
Angel:
Unless you're willing to risk the consequences of doubting me? I'll fry you like a fritter! Crispy on the outside... chewy on the inside!!!
Judge:
That... That was inspiring!
Ema:
I believe I've heard that tag line elsewhere... you could cry plagiarism?
Angel:
I may be relegated to the lowly post of lunchlady... But my instincts are honed!
Judge:
A-a photograph! You took this!?
Angel:
The moment I witnessed the crime, my reflexes took over and snap! I took a picture. In fact... One of my lunchboxes is rigged with a camera.
Phoenix:
(I suppose that's more exciting than just hanging it around your neck.)
Edgeworth:
Er... this is my first time seeing this photograph.
Angel:
You think I'd show it to you, a prosecutor? Think again.
Edgeworth:
...!
Angel:
My boyfriend works in the photography division of Criminal Affairs.
Judge:
Well... This is most certainly the defendant!
Crime Photo added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, that is unmistakably Lana Skye!)
Edgeworth:
So, what was the defendant doing at the time?
Angel:
The chief prosecutor was holding a knife in her right hand....
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Tell me more about this knife that the suspect was carrying.
Angel:
Well, I'd say the blade was about 10 centimeters long. Is that right, Mr. Edgeworth? It is your knife, after all.
Edgeworth:
Er... Ahem, yes, that's about right.
Angel:
Prosecutors are, by nature, well-versed in the location of a man's vital organs. I'm sure it was easier than boiling an egg for my egg salad surprise set.
Phoenix:
Y-you can't testify as to her ability to kill an egg! I mean, a person!
Angel:
Hmm? Perhaps a chicken salad set would have been a better metaphor?
Edgeworth:
So, the defendant was holding a knife. What then?
Present Crime Photo
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
And you witnessed this? You saw Ms. Skye stab the victim with the knife?
Angel:
As I've already said, yes! I swear it on my finest "Salmon Swirl" lunch!
Judge:
Hmm!!! I'm sure that is a fine lunch!
Phoenix:
But... isn't that odd? Look at this photograph! This is the photograph you took of the very moment of the crime, is it not? Then why is Ms. Skye not holding a knife!?
Angel:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
... Ahem. Mr. Edgeworth, your thoughts?
Edgeworth:
Objection.
Phoenix:
Let's be a little more careful with our evidence, shall we?* (That had to be the weakest objection ever, Edgeworth. in the Trilogy release)
Edgeworth:
It is you that needs to be more careful, Mr. Wright!* (Yet, it was still stronger than your ever feeble mind, Mr. Wright. in the Trilogy release)
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
This photograph was not taken the moment before the stabbing... This was taken the moment AFTER the stabbing!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
H-how can you tell that!?
Angel:
Blood splatter.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Angel:
See the dark crimson stain on the Chief Prosecutor's coat?
Phoenix:
(It's a black-and-white photograph!)
Judge:
Ah... yes, it's hard to tell, but this could be blood.
Edgeworth:
Well, Mr. Wright? I see no problem here. No problem... except you.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Are you going to just sit there and take that kind of abuse!?
Phoenix:
(Argh... You got a better idea?)
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait! That contradicts what the witness said in her testimony!"
No problem!
Phoenix:
Now that you mention it, I see no problem here. Other than myself.
Ema:
M-Mr. Wright! You can't just let him walk all over you! Th-that's just sad!
Angel:
Feeling sad, Mr. Wright? Perhaps a special "Lover's Lunchbox" would cheer you up?
Judge:
Well, that was a waste of time. Let's continue with the testimony.
Phoenix:
(Perhaps I should have dug a little deeper...)
Phoenix:
Wait! That contradicts what the witness said in her testimony! Namely, that she took the picture the "moment" she witnessed the crime!
Angel:
Well, it seems I was slightly unclear. My apologies.
Phoenix:
...
Angel:
...
Phoenix:
Th-that's it!?
Angel:
If you run out of lunch, you order seconds. Problem solved! If you don't like it, try ordering the jumbo sized lunch from the get-go!
Ema:
Good advice. I'm not sure I understood it, but... good advice.
Angel:
I didn't have time to stop her. Prosecutor Skye was cold, calculating, like a robot. She killed without pain or remorse! It was a premeditated murder!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
P-premeditated!? How do you know!?
Edgeworth:
Look at the chief prosecutor's hands in that photograph.
Judge:
Well...! Are those... gloves?
Edgeworth:
Surgical gloves made of thin rubber, most likely. Why would she have those on?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
If it was not premeditated, she would not be wearing those gloves!
Phoenix:
Waaaaaargh!
Judge:
These gloves do seem to tell a tale of premeditation!
Angel:
Premeditated murder... a serious offense.
Judge:
Witness! Add this to your testimony!
Change statements:
"The chief prosecutor was holding a knife in her right hand...." and "Then, she thrust the pointy tip of the knife into Detective Goodman's chest!" to "The murder was planned! The rubber gloves prove it!"
Angel:
Then, she thrust the pointy tip of the knife into Detective Goodman's chest!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Tell the court why you didn't try to stop this crime! You did see her raise the knife to strike, no?
Judge:
Hmm... The defense has a point.
Angel:
Unfortunately, by the time I realized what was going on, it was already too late.
Phoenix:
Too late...?
Angel:
Yes... the next moment... The chief prosecutor brought down the murder weapon!
Phoenix:
I... I see.

Angel:
The murder was planned! The rubber gloves prove it!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What if she was just in the habit of wearing gloves? Like, driving gloves?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The gloves were admitted as evidence when the defendant was arrested! They were rubber gloves, of the kind used for autopsies!
Angel:
In other words, when the chief prosecutor came to the crime scene... She came to do murder! It's the only possible conclusion one can make. Everything was planned, it was a premeditated crime!
Phoenix:
Arrrrgh!
Judge:
Impressive! I'm sorry they took you off the force, Ms. Starr!
Phoenix:
(This is bad... She's got them thinking this was all planned... If she can prove this claim, the trial's already over! I've got to think of a way to show that this wasn't premeditated!)
Present Edgeworth's Knife
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Witness, do you know what this is?"
Ema:
I-it's only a flesh wound, Mr. Wright! We can make it!
Phoenix:
You said that before. Anything else?
Ema:
Scientifically speaking... Ms. Starr's testimony... is flawless.
Phoenix:
(Sounds pretty fatal to me.)
Ema:
Wh-what do we do!? Is this it? Is my sister guilty!?
Phoenix:
Let's just keep our heads cool and press the witness a bit, shall we? (For some reason, having her panicking next to me makes me calmer...)
Ema:
D-don't smile like that!
Phoenix:
Witness, do you know what this is?
Angel:
Are you trying to test me? I sell box lunches for a living, you know. That's a knife. THE knife. The knife that was in Mr. Edgeworth's trunk!
Edgeworth:
Indeed, it is my knife.
What's with this case!?
The bloody murder weapon a red car... all belonging to the prosecutor there!?
The defendant is the chief prosecutor for the district, right?
Mommy, are prosecutors bad people?
Phoenix:
The defense has a request. We ask that the witness provide an ACCURATE testimony.
Angel:
What's that, Rookie?
Phoenix:
In your testimony... You stated that Lana Skye planned this murder. And that's why she was wearing those special gloves.
Judge:
Seems like a natural conclusion to me! The gloves do indicate planning...
Phoenix:
However! Why would she not also prepare the most important thing... the murder weapon!?
Angel:
Oh.
Phoenix:
This knife just happened to be in the trunk of that car. Ladies and gentlemen, if you're going to plan a murder, you don't forget the weapon!
Angel:
Ugh... Woooooooorrrgh!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Phoenix:
(Great! Now the tide is turning in our favor!)
Ema:
Great show, Mr. Wright! My sister's as good as free!
Edgeworth:
Wright. I believe the next lunch you'll be eating is... humble pie!
Phoenix:
W-what!?
Edgeworth:
I hope you weren't deluding yourself into thinking that the "tide has turned." Not over such a trifling detail!
Phoenix:
B-but this shoots a hole in the whole premeditated theory!
Edgeworth:
Bah! The prosecution could care less if it was premeditated or not. The only one who seems to care is that lunchlady over there.
Angel:!
Edgeworth:
The defendant, Lana Skye, murdered a detective with a knife. That is the only thing the prosecution need prove. Nothing else.
Angel:
Very good, Mr. Prosecutor... I suppose you think you're clever now? But you know as well as I do that she planned on killing him! It was planned! If it wasn't, why would she have been wearing...
Judge:
I believe I'd like to hear your testimony again.
Edgeworth:
Witness, please tell us only what you "saw," not what you "thought."
Angel:
How dare you! My powers of deduction are not to be underestimated!
Phoenix:
(Really now...)
Witness Testimony
-- Angel's Deduction --
Angel:
Lana Skye intended to murder Detective Goodman!
That's why she called the victim all the way to the Prosecutor's Office.
I'm sure the Chief Prosecutor had a grudge against the victim.
Nothing else could drive that human machine to plunge the knife in again and again...
Judge:
The victim was summoned from the Police Department to the Prosecutor's Office.. It does sound a lot like premeditation, doesn't it!?
Ema:
So, if I order pizza, does that mean I'm planning to kill the delivery boy?
Judge:
In any case, the defense may now cross-examine the witness.
Cross Examination
-- Angel's Deduction --
Angel:
Lana Skye intended to murder Detective Goodman!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You've said that, but you haven't told us how you know!
Angel:
That's what I'm about to tell you, Rookie!
Judge:
I believe what she just said was a mere prelude to the story she is about to tell. Try not to interrupt her again.
Angel:
Rookie... Never interrupt a storyteller! It's like pulling a bun out of the oven half-baked!
Phoenix:
(Something's half-baked here alright, and it's you!)
Edgeworth:
Try not to confuse the defense, witness. They're not very quick on their feet. Now, why did you believe the suspect had intentions to murder the victim?
Angel:
Her actions speak for themselves!
Angel:
That's why she called the victim all the way to the Prosecutor's Office.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You have no proof that Ms. Skye called him there!
Angel:
You have no proof that she didn't!
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth, thoughts?
Edgeworth:
There is no record of a call mad on the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye's phone.
Angel:
She might have written him a letter!
Phoenix:
(C'mon! You could have tried "public phone" first, at least!)
Edgeworth:
In any case, the victim came to the Prosecutor's Office, where he was murdered.
Judge:
I'm sure he had a reason to be there. Witness? Why do you think it was the suspect who summoned the victim that day?
Angel:
I'm sure the Chief Prosecutor had a grudge against the victim.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What kind of "grudge"!?
Angel:
Well, I wouldn't know that.
Phoenix:
Of course you don't! That's because she didn't have a grudge!
Angel:
Rookie... I have a lunchbox here. Now... what's inside?
Phoenix:
H-how am I supposed to know!?
Angel:
See? We agree there is a lunchbox here, but we don't know what's inside! A person's life is like a lunchbox with pretzels. Don't you agree?
Judge:
I-I get it! That's why my lunch was so salty!
Phoenix:
(This judge isn't very good with metaphors...)
Edgeworth:
The suspect had a grudge against Detective Goodman. Will you tell us your basis for thinking this?
Angel:
It's simple...
Angel:
Nothing else could drive that human machine to plunge the knife in again and again...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
A "human machine"!? That's a contradiction!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Please... Can't you find fault with something of substance, Mr. Wright?
Ema:
Note to self: Mr. Edgeworth's sighs smell like citrus fruit.
Phoenix:
Umm... You say "again and again"... how many times did she stab him, exactly?
Angel:
We often say "chop into a thousand pieces," but we don't actually mean 1,000 pieces. What difference does it make if the deed is done!?
Phoenix:
(How come she's getting mad at me!?)
Judge:
Let's just say she stabbed him several times and leave it at that.
Phoenix:
(Leave it at that!? This is a murder case, people!)
Ema:
Mr. Wright, you should speak up if you have an objection, you know!
Present Goodman's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You say she stabbed him again and again... But you couldn't have witnessed that!
Angel:
Are you testing me...? Then I'll test you! With my Moss Surprise!!!
Edgeworth:
I'm afraid the moss is growing under our feet as we wait, Ms. Starr.
Angel:
...!?
Judge:
W-what do you mean?
Edgeworth:
I shouldn't have to explain this... But, take a look. The autopsy report states that death was due to a loss of blood... from one stab wound.
Judge:
Ah hah! You're right! Good show, Mr. Edgeworth!
Ema:
What a hunk! He's my hero, really.
Phoenix:
(What about my objection? No one noticed?)
Judge:
Well, witness?
Angel:
You got the Crime Scene Set, right?
Judge:
Uh... oh, thanks.
Angel:
I always believed that no one could ever mistake ketchup for blood.... But now, I realize that such mistakes are possible.
Edgeworth:
So... You're saying you mistook something... for blood?
Angel:
When she lifted her knife, I thought I saw blood at her breast... Splattered blood from her victim! That's why I thought she must have stabbed him at least twice.
Judge:
Then tell us what you saw that you thought was blood! Testify!
Angel:
...
Change statement:
"Nothing else could drive that human machine to plunge the knife in again and again..." to "Her red muffler looked like blood to me... that's how ghastly the whole scene was."
Angel:
Her red muffler looked like blood to me... that's how ghastly the whole scene was.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Her red muffler?
Angel:
Yes, like a scarf. The Chief Prosecutor always wears one around her neck. So she can be easily hanged at a moment's notice, I suppose...
Phoenix:
(She's right... Ms. Skye was wearing a red scarf... wasn't she?) But wait... Isn't it odd that you mistook that for splattered blood?
Angel:
...
Judge:
Well, people often mistake my beard... For a bib.
Phoenix:
(A judge with a bib. That's why this place feels so much like kindergarten sometimes.)
Angel:
Actually... I do think I saw some traces of blood on her chest...
Edgeworth:
However, the autopsy report is clear on this matter. There was only one knife wound.
Angel:
...
Phoenix:
(Apparently, Ms. Starr isn't entirely sure of her own testimony.)
Ema:
Mr. Wright! This is our chance!!!
Phoenix:
Chance for what, I wonder...?
Present Crime Photo
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Ms. Starr! I demand an explanation..."
Phoenix:
(Ms. Starr has turned out to be as short-tempered as she looked when we met her. Challenging her abilities as a detective really set her off!)
Ema:
The short wick burns out the fastest! It's a scientific fact!
Phoenix:
I wonder... wouldn't it depend on the size of the candle? I mean, add more wax and even a really short wick will burn longer...
Ema:
...&#160;Obviously, more scientific testing is required!
Phoenix:
Ms. Starr! I demand an explanation...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The witness is clearly not suited for detective work.
Angel:
W-what!?
Edgeworth:
The suspect was not wearing a scarf or muffler of any kind when she stabbed the victim. And you've proved it yourself! With this photograph!
Angel:
Huh? B-but that... That can't be!
Edgeworth:
Only a true professional could be so clueless. I'm sure you'll make a good lunchlady, have no fear.
Judge:
Hmm! Harsh words! But good!
Ema:
In the end, Mr. Edgeworth prevails!
Phoenix:
(What was my objection, chopped liver!?)
Angel:
B-but it was there, a scarf, no, not that, but something red! Really!
Edgeworth:
Well now, where were we? The witness has given us an entertaining interlude, now back to business.
Angel:
Wh-what!?
Judge:
Very well, witness, continue your testimony. You saw the crime, and apprehended the suspect... Tell us about that.
Angel:
...... Very well. I do remember some things accurately, at least.
Phoenix:
(Ultimately, we couldn't shake the most important part of her testimony.)
Ema:
The most important part...?
Phoenix:
The part where your sister stabs the victim! (This next testimony might just be the moment of truth!)
Witness Testimony
-- Apprehending the Suspect --
Angel:
After the murder, the suspect attempted to run behind a partition off to her side.
I quickly caught her, explained her rights to her, and arrested her on the spot.
Ah, yes. When I arrested her, she mentioned the muffler!
That's what had me confused in my earlier testimony!
The chief prosecutor made to escape, but against Angel Starr, resistance is futile!
Judge:
You are quite determined about this scarf, aren't you?
Angel:
I strike like a snake and bite like a cobra! That's me. Angel Starr.
Phoenix:
That wasn't a very good metaphor. First of all, a cobra is a kind of snake.
Angel:
Don't bother me with details, unless you want to get bitten!
Phoenix:
N-no thanks!
Ema:
Note to self: Attorney Wright gets bitten by snake.
Angel:
The chief prosecutor tried to resist, but her efforts were in vain. She knocked my hands aside, kicked over an oil drum...
Phoenix:
O-oil drum? (Hard to imagine...)
Angel:
Oh, she's beautiful, but deadly! A predator, this one! A leopard woman! Rowr!
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you will.
Cross Examination
-- Apprehending the Suspect --
Angel:
After the murder, the suspect attempted to run behind a partition off to her side.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So where is this "partition" on the floor plans?
Edgeworth:
I'm sure she means this wall next to the car.
Phoenix:
(That's right... There was a wall there... about 6 feet high.)
Angel:
She was obviously trying to hide herself. Quite a natural thing for a criminal to do!
Edgeworth:
And what did you do then?
Angel:
I quickly caught her, explained her rights to her, and arrested her on the spot.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You say "quickly"... were you close to the suspect?
Angel:
As I just said! I was only 30 feet away from her the whole time.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe I should press her for more details?)
Leave her alone
Phoenix:
(How far away was she when she witnessed the murder? I guess I could just look at the picture to find out.) Very well, you may continue with your testimony.
Press her
Leads to:
"I'd like to see this on the floor plans, just to be safe."
Phoenix:
I'd like to see this on the floor plans, just to be safe. The Lunchland car was...
Edgeworth:
She was a "visitor," thus, she was parked in B Block.
Phoenix:
So, you witnessed the murder from... here?
Judge:
That would make it about 30 feet from the car, yes.
Phoenix:
Is that correct, Ms. Starr?
Angel:
Y-yes, that's right.
Judge:
But, there was a chain link fence in front of you...?
Angel:
I went over it, of course.
Judge:
Amazing! The Cough-up Queen, lunchlady athlete, indeed.
Ema:
It would have taken her a little time to climb over the fence. So she couldn't have gotten to my sister THAT fast...
Phoenix:
(Yeah, that fence was about nine feet high, too. How come Ms. Skye didn't get away?)
Angel:
Ah, yes. When I arrested her, she mentioned the muffler!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
She mentioned the muffler? What exactly did she say?
Angel:
If I remembered exactly I would have told you in my testimony!
Phoenix:
(Cheeky!)
Angel:
Anyway, all I heard her say was the word "muffler."
Judge:
Just that one word?
Edgeworth:
So... what you heard wasn't the suspect talking to you, but to someone else?
Angel:
Yes. The chief prospector was talking on her phone!
Phoenix:
(Her phone? You mean... this cell phone?)
Ask further
Leads to:
"By phone... do you mean this cell phone, discovered at the crime scene?"
Leave it be
Phoenix:
(Ms. Skye's cell phone... The last number she called was her sister, Ema! Hmm... if I press this too hard, who knows who the snake will bite...?)
Edgeworth:
The witness may continue with her testimony.
Phoenix:
By phone... do you mean this cell phone, discovered at the crime scene?
Angel:
Yes, ultimately.
Edgeworth:
Ultimately?
Angel:
My memory... it's like a salmon, heading upstream, you see.
Judge:
N-no, the court doesn't see, Ms. Starr.
Angel:
The chief prosecutor first attempted to use the phone hanging on the wall.
Judge:
On the wall?
Phoenix:
(That's right! Near the car... there was an emergency phone on the wall!)
Angel:
Apparently, it was out of order.
Judge:
And so she used her cell phone?
Edgeworth:
Indeed, the emergency phone was out of order that day.
Judge:
Hmm. Good witnessing, witness!
Phoenix:
(Good witnessing? What ever happened to good testifying?)
Judge:
You should of course add this to your testimony.
Angel:
The things I do to please this rookie defense attorney.
Cell phone updated in the Court Record.
Change statement:
"That's what had me confused in my earlier testimony!" to "She gave up trying to use the phone on the wall and just used her cell phone!"
Angel:
That's what had me confused in my earlier testimony!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, you never saw this muffler?
Angel:
...!
Judge:
Witness?
Edgeworth:
As the photograph proves, she couldn't have seen it.
Angel:
... That's true.
Ema:
Ms. Starr... is acting strangely. First she mistakes a scarf for splattered blood... And now she says she didn't see any scarf!
Phoenix:
(She doesn't strike me as the kind of witness to make careless mistakes, either... I'm sure she saw something red... but what!?)
Angel:
She gave up trying to use the phone on the wall and just used her cell phone!* (I saw it all -- how she tried the phone on the wall but had to use her cell instead. in the Trilogy release)
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Um... do you think you could restate your testimony for the court?
Judge:
Ah hah! I was going to ask the same thing!
Angel:
I'll only say this one time, so listen close, Rookies. The chief prosecutor stabbed the victim, and ran behind the partition. Then she picked up the emergency phone on the wall, but it was out of order. So she pulled her own cell phone out of her pocket.
Judge:
And during that time, you climbed over the chain link fence...
Angel:
Then, when I boldly grabbed her arm... The chief prosecutor hung up her phone!
Phoenix:
And you saw her doing this?
Ema:
...? What is it, Mr. Wright?
Present Parking Lot Floor Plans after fully pressing second statement
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I have to conclude that you have a personal grudge against Ms. Lana Skye."
Angel:
The chief prosecutor made to escape, but against Angel Starr, resistance is futile!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
She "made to escape"... Can you be more specific?
Angel:
She brushed aside my hand and ran! It was a terrible sight to see, like a dollop of lard on a pate of foie gras!
Phoenix:
(Huh?)
Angel:
She even kicked over an oil drum at me!
Phoenix:
A-an oil drum!?
Judge:
There was an oil drum lying on its side at the scene of the crime.
Edgeworth:
But, it's strange...
Judge:
Hmm? What's that?
Edgeworth:
If she wanted to escape... why didn't she run the other way?
Judge:
The other... ah! The car entrance!
Ema:
Th-that's right! It doesn't make any sense that she would run from behind the partition to the oil drums!
Angel:
...
Ema:
Excellent! More mysteries!
Phoenix:
I wish we could solve a few before finding more, though...
Phoenix:
(So Ms. Skye tried to run?)
Ema:
I'm sorry my sister is so suspicious, Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
Not as sorry as I am.
Ema:
But she didn't do it! You have to believe me!
Phoenix:
I have to conclude that you have a personal grudge against Ms. Lana Skye.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The witness is a former detective. Her testimony is unmarred by personal bias.
Angel:
Well, who would have thought you would be my knight in shining armor, prosecutor? You who, together with the chief prosecutor, kicked me out two years ago!
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Starr... This is a fatal contradiction with your testimony... How do you explain this?
Angel:
Hmph! I don't know what you're talking about. Mess with me... and I'll make you cough it ALL up!
Phoenix:
Ahem. Let's look at the floor plans. You said you witnessed the crime from this point. However, if that's true... You couldn't possibly have seen Ms. Skye making that phone call!
Angel:
...!
Phoenix:
I believe you see what I'm getting at. That emergency phone was on the back side of this partition. If, indeed, you were in B Block... You couldn't have seen it!
Angel:
Wha... Waaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!
Judge:
Order! Order! What is the meaning of this?
Phoenix:
It's simple, Your Honor. She's not coughing up lunch...&#160; she's coughing up lies!!!
Angel:
Grrr!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That's quite a claim, Mr. Wright... perhaps you will allow me a question? Tell us exactly what lie this witness has told the court!
Phoenix:
(Here's where the counterattack begins! I can't afford to get this wrong!) The witness lied about...
What she saw
Phoenix:
She lied about what she saw! In other words, she didn't see Ms. Skye using that emergency phone!
Judge:
It does seem hard to imagine how she could have! Very logical!
Angel:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(What's the matter, Starr? Cat got your lunchbox?)
Ema:
Um, Mr. Wright... I hate to bother you while you're celebrating your victory... But why would Ms. Starr lie like that?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
Why would she say that my sister had tried to use the phone, but failed? It doesn't make any sense! Why lie about something so insignificant?
Phoenix:
Oh... (Dang, she's right!)
Ema:
I mean, maybe she really did see her try to use the emergency phone.
Edgeworth:
I see no room for doubt here.
Angel:
You ordered the P'tooey on rice, right?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! And I thought you had something there!
Phoenix:
Ugh. (One... one more try!)
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I see it in your eyes. You haven't learned your lesson, have you?
Leads back to:
"Tell us exactly what lie this witness has told the court!"
Where she saw it
Leads to:
"She tried to use the emergency phone... but it was out of order."
The order of events
Phoenix:
She lied about the order of events! Ms. Skye used that emergency phone BEFORE the murder!
Judge:
I-I see! I hadn't thought of that!
Angel:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(That took the wind out of her sails!)
Ema:
Um, Mr. Wright... I hate to bother you while you're celebrating your victory... But... why would anyone use the emergency phone before the murder?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Just when you think he can't sink any lower, he amazes us. I applaud you, Mr. Wright.
Angel:
You ordered the Orange-peel Lunchbox, right?
Judge:
I guess that teaches me to not get excited BEFORE the evidence!
Phoenix:
Ugh. (One... one more try!)
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I see it in your eyes. You haven't learned your lesson, have you?
Leads back to:
"Tell us exactly what lie this witness has told the court!"
Phoenix:
She tried to use the emergency phone... but it was out of order. What is significant about this fact? Nothing. It would be pointless for her to lie about it!
Judge:
Pointless to lie... I see!
Phoenix:
The witness did actually see Ms. Skye using the emergency phone. In other words... Ms. Starr witnessed the crime from a different location!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
A different location!? Now that's a pointless lie if I ever heard one!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Before you call my lie pointless... at least let me tell it!
Judge:
Let me ask a question to our clever wordsmith, Mr. Wright. Just where was the witness when she saw the crime!?
Phoenix:
(All the testimony we've heard until now points in one direction...) The place from where Ms. Starr witnessed this crime was... here!
Present Security room
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is the only place where she could have been."
Present anywhere else to the left of the partition
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
If she was here, she could see the emergency phone!
Judge:
Th-that's true! That solves the mystery!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That would allow her to see the emergency phone, yes... But if she was there... She would have been able to arrest her well before she dialed her cell phone!
Phoenix:
Oh...
Angel:
You doubt my speed? I can run 150 feet in nine seconds, you know!
Phoenix:
(Is that really that fast?)
Judge:
Not as fast as your witty rejoinders!
Phoenix:
Ah... uh, yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"(All the testimony we've heard until now points in one direction...)"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
I think! I mean, it's highly likely that's where she was.
Angel:
You "think"?
Edgeworth:
It's "highly likely"?
Ema:
Your cavalier attitude stands in stark contrast to your feeble argument, Mr. Wright.
Edgeworth:
Her being there wouldn't change a thing!
Judge:
Please, Mr. Wright, think before you speak.
Phoenix:
Ah... uh, yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"(All the testimony we've heard until now points in one direction...)"
Phoenix:
This is the only place where she could have been.
Judge:
The security guard room?
Edgeworth:
Indeed, the security room in the underground parking lot is well positioned... It's built on the second level, so you can see the entire lot.
Judge:
Hmm... She would have been able to see the emergency phone from there. But why there? There are many other places where she could have seen the phone.
Phoenix:
Not in this case, Your Honor. The witness, not being part of the Prosecutor's Office, couldn't park in A Block. The only place where she could have seen the crime and the back of the partition is here. I remember in your testimony, you said... You brought a lunch to your&#160;"boyfriend" in the security guard room, yes? Well, Ms. Starr?
Angel:
... How many years have I been getting the better of men...? To think that the tables could be turned... Today, a man has got the better of Angel Starr!
Judge:
Order! Order! Witness! What have you done!? You used to be a detective! You should know better!
Angel:
I'm not turning back. The guilty will be punished. And I'll do what I must to make sure justice prevails.
Phoenix:
(The guilty... is she talking about Ms. Skye...?)
Ema:
Um, Mr. Wright? Doesn't this strike you as odd? Why did Ms. Starr lie? It doesn't make sense!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
She could have just said she saw the crime from the security guard station. It wouldn't change anything!
Edgeworth:
Exactly! This photograph tells all! It was the defendant who stabbed the victim! That truth still stands!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
It "still stands"? I disagree, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Wh-what!?
Phoenix:
If a witness is found to be lying, they're guilty of perjury. She knows this. She wouldn't risk that without a good reason!
Judge:
So, tell us what her reason was, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
... Huh? M-me?
Judge:
Who else!?
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Let's review what we know!
Phoenix:
(Ms. Starr witnessed the crime from the security guard station... But she lied and said she saw it from B Block... It must make a vital difference... but what? What would change...?)
Angle of view to the crime
Phoenix:
Why, the angle at which she saw the crime occur would change!
Judge:
The angle...? What do you mean!?
Phoenix:
Uh, um, well... The security guard station is on the second floor... and um... She would have sort of a more 3-D view of the crime.
Judge:
And this is important... why?
Phoenix:
Um...
Judge:
...
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Perhaps you'd like to reconsider, Mr. Wright?
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright! Let's review what we know!"
Distance to the crime
Leads to:
"It changes the distance between her and the scene of the crime!"
Difference in lighting
Phoenix:
It's a difference in lighting!
Judge:
Lighting...? What does that mean!?
Phoenix:
Well, it means, uh... See, the security guard station is on the second level... So, uh, she would have seen the crime in better lighting conditions.
Judge:
And this is important... why?
Phoenix:
Um...
Judge:
...
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Perhaps you'd like to reconsider, Mr. Wright?
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright! Let's review what we know!"
Phoenix:
It changes the distance between her and the scene of the crime!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
My condolences, Mr. Wright... But one look at the floor plans and it's quite clear. The distance between the scene of the crime and the guard station is 30 feet. I don't see how that would change what she could see.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
What she saw is not in question here. What matters is the time it would take her to reach the scene of the crime!
Edgeworth:
...!
Phoenix:
Ms. Starr! You witnessed the crime from the security guard station! Now, how long did it take you to go from there... to the scene of the crime, where you arrested Ms. Skye!?
Angel:
...
Judge:
Well, witness?
Angel:
You...
Phoenix:
Y-yes...?
Angel:
You ordered the Squid Wheels, right?
Phoenix:
(The quality of my lunches has gone from low to inedible.)
Angel:
I was bringing a PB&amp;J lunch with fresh boysenberry jam to my boyfriend.
Judge:
Hmm... Boysenberry for the boyfriend!
Angel:
He wasn't in the station, so I waited. I witnessed the crime from the glass-walled station... and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself running towards the scene. But... the door was locked. I couldn't open it. That's why I had to go through the visitor's parking in B Block.
Judge:
That's quite a detour.
Angel:
It probably took me at least five minutes to get to the scene of the crime.
Judge:
F-f-f-five minutes!? Hmm... This changes things considerably!
Angel:
But, it was that woman over there in the defendant's chair who stabbed him! I know it! I have photographic evidence! I swear it... I swear it on my finest plastic spork!
Judge:
You have a point. And the spork is a wonderful invention.
Angel:
Would you like another Caviar Lunch...?
Judge:
Absolutely!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh...)
Ema:
Mr. Wright! You have to do something!
Phoenix:
(Do I have any evidence to stop this...?)
Raise an objection
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Five minutes between the witnessing of the murder and the arrest!"
Sit back and observe
Phoenix:
(I think I need more evidence before I go sticking my spork in this mess...)
Judge:
Woo! Caviar! Ah... how it makes my eyes tingle!
Ema:
Mr. Wright! No evidence can win against the raw power of caviar! It's a scientific fact! The only thing that's left... Is your strong presence and deft powers of deduction!
Phoenix:
...!
Ema:
Let's screw the lid back on those overpriced fish eggs!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Five minutes between the witnessing of the murder and the arrest!"
Phoenix:
Five minutes between the witnessing of the murder and the arrest! Think about it! You could make pasta in that amount of time! If you like it al dente!
Angel:
I've got lunchboxes that tie pasta into knots, Rookie!
Phoenix:
A five minute "blank"... Isn't that strange!?
Edgeworth:
Strange...?
Phoenix:
If you were a criminal... What would you do with five minutes, Your Honor?
Judge:
Well, um... I guess I'd flee the scene. Hey! D-don't get the wrong idea! I didn't kill anyone...
Phoenix:
But you have the instincts of a killer! You would run! But this time was different! Ms. Skye dawdled at the scene of the crime... she even had her picture taken! No true criminal would act this way! It's inconceivable!
Angel:
Y- yeeeaaargh!
Judge:
Well then. It seems we've come to the end of this testimony. She has a grudge against the defendant, and there is a blank in her testimony.
Angel:
...!
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth, is the next witness ready to go?
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately... I appear to have overestimated this witness on account of her professional history...
Ema:
We did it! We screwed that can shut, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Th-that was too close!)
Judge:
I'm afraid that the Cough-up Queen has been dethroned. And with that, court is adjourned!
Hold it!
Angel:
Mr. Edgeworth, you ordered the Squid Wheels, right?
Phoenix:
(That's the one she tried to foist off on me!)
Edgeworth:
I prefer to not take the defense team's leftovers. Anything else to say?
Angel:
I... might be able to save you. I have decisive evidence.
Judge:
Wh-what was that!?
Phoenix:
(Is this another one of her trick lunchboxes!?)
Judge:
My apologies, but we have no further questions to ask of you, Ms. Starr.
Angel:
Ah... Is this your jumbo lunchbox?
Judge:
Whoo hoo! A triple-decker! Out of deference to the witness's determination, I'll allow one more testimony! Let's hear about this decisive evidence.
Angel:
Like the Lunchland motto says, you won't be disappointed!
Phoenix:
(What's she going to pull out of her lunchbox this time!?)
Witness Testimony
-- Decisive Evidence --
Angel:
I should have mentioned those five minutes when I wasn't looking at the crime scene.
And now, to the matter of the victim's shoe... Did I not bring this up...?
Two types of blood were found on this shoe!
One was of course the victim's.
And the other was...! The defendant, Ms. Lana Skye's blood!
This shoe proves it! It's flawless, decisive evidence!
Judge:
Wh-what!? There was blood found on that shoe!?
Angel:
Try Lunchland, for all your lunch and decisive evidence needs!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Witness, what's the meaning of this? Why is this the first time I've heard of this evidence?
Angel:
Simple. As I've already said... I don't trust you with evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! That's why I took the liberty of investigating this myself.
Edgeworth:
And... you had blood tests performed?
Angel:
Didn't I mention? I have three boyfriends in forensics.
Edgeworth:
In any case, Your Honor, I can't accept this as evidence!
Angel:
What...?
Edgeworth:
You should know the two rules of evidence law, Ms. Starr! Rule 1: no evidence shall be shown without the approval of the Police Department! In other words, this shoe is illegal evidence! At least, for the time being!
Ema:
I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
It seems so. Edgeworth sure is celebrating.
Angel:
Not so fast, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...!
Angel:
Don't forget... I used to be a detective! As I mentioned previously... This shoe has already been tested by a member of the forensics department! As you can see, it was approved by the Police Department as of... today. Even the general public can produce official evidence, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Nuh... Ungh!
Ema:
I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
It seems so. Edgeworth is looking pretty sullen.
Ema:
You could at least study some evidence law! Really!
Judge:
The prosecution's complaints notwithstanding... It appears that this evidence satisfies the first rule of evidence law. Well... It seems you have yet another count against you, witness.
Angel:
Anything to ensure that the guilty are properly judged.
Victim's Shoe added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness!
Examine evidence
Blood on Victim's Shoe
Ema:
This blood... It's my sister's, right?
Phoenix:
It appears so. (Lana's right hand was bandaged when I saw her in jail. She must have cut herself at the time of the crime...)
Ema:
Poor Sis...
Blood under Victim's Shoe
Ema:
AAAH! There's blood here too!
Phoenix:
On the sole of the shoe? It's got to be the victim's. He must have stepped in a puddle of his own blood.
Ema:
All this blood... It's horrible!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... This blood might be an important clue...)
Cross Examination
-- Decisive Evidence --
Angel:
I should have mentioned those five minutes when I wasn't looking at the crime scene.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why did you lie about those five minutes?
Angel:
I guess you could say, I just wanted people to look at the results.
Phoenix:
The... results?
Angel:
How many times do I have to say this? I saw the chief prosecutor stab the victim before my very own eyes! Compared to that... A five minute "blank" means nothing!
Edgeworth:
Then why didn't you just tell the truth!
Angel:
Don't make me laugh! We're dealing with the most untrustworthy of the vile lot known as prosecutors! Falsified evidence, arranged testimonies, erasing and manipulating evidence... When you fight monsters, you need to use every trick in the book!
Phoenix:
(This when the suspect is admitting she did it?)
Judge:
False testimony is the most despicable crime of all, Ms. Starr. Let's just get this over with.
Angel:
And now, to the matter of the victim's shoe... Did I not bring this up...?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And, you found this shoe at the scene of the crime?
Angel:
I detained the chief prosecutor, and notified the Police Department... I wanted to make myself useful while I was waiting for the police to arrive.
Edgeworth:
So, like an ill-trained pooch, you snuck off with a shoe!
Angel:
I was afraid someone would erase the chief prosecutor's crime. This shoe was my secret weapon if that should happen. See this fashionable basket I have here...? It carries more than lunchboxes, gentlemen!
Phoenix:
(I'm happy for you and your lunchbox bag, really.)
Judge:
In any case, you removed valuable evidence from the scene of the crime.Now, tell us what you did next.
Angel:
Two types of blood were found on this shoe! One was of course the victim's.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, you brought it to the forensics department?
Angel:
If you're going to submit something as evidence in court, you need it approved. To do that, evidence must be analyzed... by a forensics expert.
Phoenix:
(And she got away with her little coup because she used to be a detective...)
Judge:
The shoe does appear to have bloodstains on it.
Angel:
Makes sense. After all, a man was stabbed here.
Phoenix:
And that blood belonged to the victim, Detective Goodman?
Angel:
As I said, there were two types of blood found on the shoe.
Angel:
And the other was...! The defendant, Ms. Lana Skye's blood!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You can't say for sure the blood belonged to the victim with a blood test!
Angel:
You claim to know something about blood tests, Rookie?
Phoenix:
Huh...
Angel:
Well, speak up!
Phoenix:
Uh, well... Blood comes in four types... A, B, O, and AB... However! You can't tell from a blood test whether a murder was performed... in cold blood!
Angel:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
... That's just a figure of speech, Mr. Wright.
Ema:
Actually, if you combine all the various blood tests, there are millions of types! It's practically impossible to narrow a blood sample down to one person! Or so I hear.
Phoenix:
M-millions of types?
Angel:
If I had a little more time, I would have gotten DNA test results... But they said there's very little doubt it could be anyone's but Ms. Lana Skye's.
Judge:
Hmm... So the suspect's blood was found on the victim's shoe...
Edgeworth:
That ties her directly to the death of Detective Goodman!
Phoenix:
(I was afraid he was going to say that...)
Angel:
This shoe proves it! It's flawless, decisive evidence!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
(I can't let this evidence go through without a fight!)
Angel:
You ordered the peppered fish guts, right?
Phoenix:
...!
Angel:
Some like it hot, Mr. Wright. Some, like your client. She's in enough hot water to make a whole batch of soup.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Do you or don't you have a problem with this shoe!?
Phoenix:
A problem...? (This is critical! What's wrong with the victim's shoe?)
There's no problem
Phoenix:
(No... there's nothing there. And if I just stab blindly at it, I'll hurt my case.)
Ema:
C'mon, Mr. Wright, I know you can find something! Some kind of off-the-cuff contradiction!
Phoenix:
I'm trying to avoid saying things off-the-cuff today.
There's a problem
Leads to:
"If I'm not imagining things..."
Phoenix:
If I'm not imagining things... I'd say there is one critical problem with this evidence... A clear contradiction!
Angel:
That gleam in your eyes... You're still young, Rookie. I'd give you a peppered fish gut now, but you couldn't take the heat, could you!
Judge:
Let's hear what Mr. Wright has to say! What is contradictory about the victim's shoe? Show us the problem with this evidence!
Present blood on sole
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I wonder if you noticed... there's blood on the bottom of this shoe!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The problem with this evidence... is here!
Judge:
Where?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Take that finger and point it at your own head, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... guess that wasn't it.)
Ema:
Mr. Wright, let's be scientific about this! Examine the evidence!
Judge:
As I thought, a waste of time. Well, that was a nice break. Let's return to the testimony, shall we?
Phoenix:
I wonder if you noticed... there's blood on the bottom of this shoe!
Angel:
Don't mess with me, Rookie... Or it'll be your blood on the bottom of my shoe!
Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, there is quite a bit of blood on the bottom of the shoe.
Edgeworth:
It makes sense. The victim was stabbed with a knife! What could possibly be contradictory about blood on the bottom of his shoe!?
Present Crime Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The problem lies... in the footprint."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
... I'm guessing your shoe has blood on it too... you just shot yourself in the foot!
Phoenix:
Arrgh...
Angel:
Would you like a grinder, or a grind from the heel of my boot, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
(Man... tough crowd.)
Ema:
Mr. Wright, let's be scientific about this! Examine the evidence!
Judge:
As I thought, a waste of time. Well, that was a nice break. Let's return to the testimony, shall we?
Phoenix:
(That's pretty sly, hiding evidence like that!)
Ema:
There's nothing sly about a lawyer using the law as a weapon! In any case, science is always on our side! Don't forget! Scientific investigation is the wave of the future!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe I should "investigate" this evidence a little more closely...)
Phoenix:
The problem lies... in the footprint.
Angel:
The... footprint?
Phoenix:
Note that the bottom of the victim's shoe is covered in blood. Then... isn't it strange? Why weren't any bloody footprints found by the scene of the crime!?
Judge:
Ah hah!
Phoenix:
As you can see... There were no traces of any such footprints at the scene of the crime! That contradicts your claim about this shoe!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This picture only shows part of the floor, so there could have been bloody footprints.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
If there were bloody prints they would have been found. We checked the scene and found nothing of the sort!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Well, witness!?
Angel:
What!? Huh? I, uh...
Ema:
Great going, Mr. Wright! But... It's true that the lack of a footprint is a contradiction... But then we have to ask why there wasn't a footprint!
Phoenix:
Oh!
Judge:
That's true! There has to be a reason why there wasn't a footprint!
Ema:
Think, Mr. Wright, think!
Phoenix:
... Hey, I don't know why it's not there. I'm just good at finding contradictions.
Ema:
What!?
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I see... Now I get it!
Phoenix:
(Get what!?)
Edgeworth:
Our witness is more devious than I gave her credit for! We were hoodwinked to the very end! But she slipped! There is one vital hint to the truth in her testimony...
Judge:
Wh-what are you talking about?
Edgeworth:
Think back to when she told us about apprehending the suspect...
Angel:
The chief prosecutor tried to resist, but her efforts were in vain. She knocked my hands aside, kicked over an oil drum... Oh, she's beautiful, but deadly! A predator, this one! A leopard woman! Rowr!
Edgeworth:
I thought that was a strange thing for the normally cool-headed chief to do.
Phoenix:
(No kidding!)
Edgeworth:
Now, witness. Allow me to ask a very simple question. This "oil drum"... was it empty?
Angel:
... Oh, that, hmm? I'm not sure I like your attitude, Mr. Edgeworth. Though apparently you're not the slowest conveyor belt in the lunchbox factory.
Judge:
Witness! W-well? Was the oil drum empty...?
Angel:
The oil drum kicked over by the chief prosecutor... was brimming with water.
Phoenix:
W-water? (What does that mean?)
Edgeworth:
Still don't get it, Mr. Wright? Do you want to know the reason she knocked it over? The REAL reason?
Judge:
Aaaa haaaaah! You don't mean...!
Edgeworth:
Yes, the suspect knocked over that oil drum for one reason and one reason alone! To erase the blood stains that would become evidence against her!
Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaargh!
Judge:
That ties things up quite nicely! The blood stains left on the victim's shoes tie her quite clearly to this murder! Then, after the deed was done, she knocked over the oil drum to erase the telltale signs!
Angel:
Why, that's a prosecutor's specialty... erasing evidence!
Phoenix:
(That reminds me... Ms. Skye's right hand was hurt... Didn't she say she'd cut herself when she stabbed him...?)
Ema:
So my sister's blood on the shoe... That's when it happened?
Judge:
Well... I see no reason to prolong this trial.
Ema:
M-Mr. Wright! Do something! Please!
Phoenix:
W-what!? What can I do? Your sister has confessed to the crime, and she tried to conceal it!
Ema:
B-but...
Edgeworth:
Enough. There is no need for further debate. The verdict, Your Honor!
Judge:
Very well...
Ema:
But Angel Starr is on the prosecution's side! She could have been lying about the water!
Judge:
This court finds the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye...
Hold it!
Angel:
Little girl... What did you just say?
Ema:
Huh...? M-me?
Angel:
Did you say that I, Angel Starr... was on the prosecution's side?
Ema:
W-well, yeah, you are! You're saying my sister hid evidence by erasing the bloody footprints!
Angel:
Well. I thought you'd had your fill, but here you are, demanding a second helping! Another lunchbox... A lunchbox called "evidence"!
Judge:
W-wait... Witness, don't tell me you have something else?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You've reached your verdict, Your Honor! Any further comments will be held in contempt of court!
Angel:
Your threats don't scare the Cough-up Queen! Look at this!!!
Judge:
A photograph...?
Angel:
I had this just in case anyone had the gall to suggest... that the white shoe didn't belong to the victim!
Judge:
Hmm... I see no room for error in this evidence.
Ema:
M-Mr. Wright, wait! Look at the asphalt in this photo!
Phoenix:
Hey! It's clearly wet!
Judge:
Erasing the last trace of doubt from the court's mind. Immediately after the murder, the crime scene was washed with water!
Ema:
I-I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I guess I... I couldn't help after all.
Phoenix:
(It's not your fault... I knew I couldn't win this case from the beginning. And... it seems this is what your sister wanted anyway! ... I'm sorry, Mia...) ... ... ...
Wright... wet or not...Don't be so quick to throw in the towel...
Phoenix:
...!
Get yourself up off the asphalt... take another good look...Don't give up... Not until the bitter end.
Phoenix:
(This is the last piece of evidence...)
Judge:
Very well! This time I'd like to declare a verdict for good!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, wait!
Judge:
What is it with you people!? Can't I hand down my verdicts in peace anymore!? Whatever it is, can it wait?
Phoenix:
N-no it can't. Then it will be too late! Look at this photograph, the last one submitted... This trial isn't over... until we give each piece of evidence proper consideration!
Edgeworth:
So, Wright... Are you saying there's a problem with this latest piece of evidence?
Phoenix:
Yeah! (I'll think later!) Yeah, there's a problem! (Right or wrong, I've got to go ahead with this!)
Judge:
I suppose since we've come this far, we should give every claim a fair shake. Very well, Mr. Wright. Show the court the problem in this photograph!
Present muffler
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The problem in this photograph... is here!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well... it's probably here! Don't you think?
Judge:
As your elder, Mr. Wright, let me give you a piece of advice... When you point at something, at least remember to keep your eyes open?
Angel:
I believe he's trying to say that no one's falling for your bluffs, Mr. Wright!
Ema:
Open your eyes, Mr. Wright! Think scientifically!
Leads back to:
"I suppose since we've come this far, we should give every claim a fair shake."
Phoenix:
The problem in this photograph... is here!
Edgeworth:
What's this...? There's something poking out of the car's muffler!
Judge:
Wait just a moment, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor?
Judge:
You just said "muffler"... However I see no trace of a muffler or scarf of any kind in this photograph!
Edgeworth:
... A muffler is also a part on a car or motorcycle, Your Honor. Just think of it as... part of the exhaust system. A pipe...
Judge:
I see! And... I see! What's that suspicious-looking cloth sticking out of the car's muffler?
Angel:
Hmph! So what if there is something sticking out of the muffler! What does that have to do with this case? Nothing! Absolutely nothing!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Sorry, Ms. Starr... But it's not going to be that easy! In fact, you've already told us why this is important to the case... You said as much in your testimony!!!
Angel:
Wh-what!?
Judge:
Let's hear what Mr. Wright has on his mind! Tell us why you think this piece of cloth in the muffler is related to this case.
Present Lana's Cell Phone
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ms. Starr! Recall your testimony for the court..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well, Your Honor? How do you feel about that?
Judge:
Actually, I don't feel well at all. I have this pounding headache...
Phoenix:
No, no, I meant, what do you think about the...
Judge:
I'm afraid the reason for that headache is you, Mr. Wright!
Ema:
That cloth was found in the car's "muffler," right...? Muffler... muffler... Where have I heard that word recently? Muffler...
Leads back to:
"Let's hear what Mr. Wright has on his mind!"
Phoenix:
Ms. Starr! Recall your testimony for the court...
Angel:
Ah yes. When I arrested her, she mentioned the muffler! That's what had me confused in my earlier testimony!
Angel:
Muffler! argh! Yeearrrrgh!
Phoenix:
Could it be that the "muffler" you heard mentioned... Was actually this exhaust pipe!? If so! That means this piece of cloth is vital evidence!
Angel:
Oh... Whooooooooooo ooooooooooooragh!
Judge:
Well... It seems we will have to suspend the proceedings.
Angel:
Sus... Suspend!?
Judge:
I find myself wondering about that piece of cloth. If we leave any question unanswered here we do a disservice to the law! Have the car at the crime scene inspected at once, and bring me that cloth! The verdict will wait until after we've seen all the evidence. Agreed...?
Edgeworth:
... I suppose so.
Phoenix:
(Whew... that was close. But... we made it... at least for now!)
Judge:
The court will adjourn for a thirty minute recess! It's lunchtime after all!
Phoenix:
(He's still hungry!?)
To be continued.
February 23, 11:56 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Ema:
Um... Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Huh? What?
Ema:
Are trials... always like this with you? Like you're swimming up from the bottom of a lake, about to reach the surface... But no matter how hard you paddle you never seem to get there...
Phoenix:
Pretty much. Except today we're swimming in quicksand. So what happened to your sister, anyway?
Ema:
Apparently she got called off to the judge's chambers.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Probably something to do with that piece of cloth.
Ema:
So! This is where we turn this trial around, right? Our only weapon, a tiny, insignificant piece of cloth!
Phoenix:
I'm the one who's starting to feel tiny and insignificant to tell the truth.
???:
Hola, Pardner!
Marshall:
They say you show a red cloth to a bull, it'll fire up its temper! That's what they told me when I was a young'un, at least.
Ema:
Officer Marshall!
Marshall:
Thought I'd come take a look-see at how the trial's going. Looks like I'm late. They've got the place locked down tighter than a fort in enemy territory!
Phoenix:
What is going on over there, anyway? All the police I've seen these last two days have been really on edge.
Marshall:
Don't you got enough on your plate without worrying about other people, compadre? You could be worrying about the chief prosecutor's taste in mufflers, for example.
Ema:
Um... Officer Marshall? The whole "muffler" thing didn't have anything to do with scarves... She wasn't even wearing a scarf!
Marshall:
You don't say? Now don't that just beat all.
Ema:
...?
Marshall:
I've seen the red breeze blow at her slender neck many a time... I saw it that day, too. She was wearing a red muffler.
Ema:
What!?
Marshall:
At the awards ceremony that afternoon. Edgeworth's seen it too, I'd reckon.
Phoenix:
(What does that mean!? In the photograph taken at the crime scene... she wasn't wearing a scarf!)
Ema:
So, Ms. Starr wasn't mistaken...
Marshall:
Well, it's about time. Remember, pardner, sometimes you gotta grab the bull by the horns... and sometimes you just gotta let that bull go where it will. Time will tell!
Phoenix:
(Ugh... I have a bad feeling about this.)
Ema:
So... what are we swimming in now, Mr. Wright?
Marshall:
If it's steak sauce, I can hook you up with some fine ribs! Ooh-wee!
February 23, 12:32 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
I'd... like to... resume...?
Phoenix:
(What's up? The judge keeps looking over at the prosecution...)
Judge:
Is something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Your face is blue, your lips are purple, you're sweating bullets... That furrowed brow, those grinding teeth, those watery eyes... What's more your eyes are unfocused, you're doubled over, your back is bent...
Edgeworth:
It... can't... be!! This... can't... happen!
Ema:
I wonder what happened to Mr. Edgeworth?
Judge:
Well then, I believe it is time we continued on with this trial. During our recess I had requested that the prosecution conduct an investigation...
Edgeworth:
Th-this is unacceptable!
Judge:
Hmm... It seems our prosecutor is quite beside himself.
???:
Ah, er, excuse me. Knock knock?
Judge:
...? Who's there?
Phoenix:
(What's with this guy? A strange, stuffy aura seems to be filling the courtroom.)
Ema:
Hey! The temperature rose 5.7 degrees when that man came in!
Phoenix:
(Who on earth is he...?)
Judge:
Ah, it's you...
???:
Oh! Oh, heh heh. Sorry I'm late, Udgey! The roads were packed. It's just me! Long time no see, eh, Udgey? How ya been? Swim much these days!
Judge:
Ah! Hello, hello. No, I've been so busy...
???:
Busy! Busy-smizzy, Udgey, my boy! You have to make time to relax!
Judge:
Y-yes, indeed.
Ema:
Udgey... seems to be his nickname for the judge...?
Phoenix:
I'm afraid you're right. Very afraid. Um... sorry, but... who are you?
???:
Ah hah! So you're Wrighto! The attorney! I've heard good things about you, son!
Phoenix:
Eh? Uh, th-thanks...?
???:
So sorry about our little Worthy giving you all that trouble, eh? You know, we should all go swimming together sometime! Jolly!
Phoenix:
Little... Little Worthy...?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You don't know the district Chief of Police!?
Phoenix:
Chuh....? Chief of Police...!?
Judge:
He's the top ranking police officer in the entire district!
Gant:
Name's Gant, Damon Gant. Pleased to meet you, everyone!
Judge:
So, uh, to what do we owe this honor today? It's been over... two years since you last came to this courtroom, hasn't it?
Gant:
Well, it's Worthy, here. Look at the poor fellow! I just thought I'd help out... by bringing this.
Phoenix:
Hey! Th-that's...!
Ema:
My sister's muffler!
Phoenix:
(So Ms. Starr wasn't just seeing things! When the crime occurred, Ms. Skye really was wearing that muffler!)
Gant:
But to think that it was stuffed into that exhaust pipe... On little Worthy's car, no less! It's really quite embarrassing, even for us.
Judge:
Wh-what's this!?
Gant:
It's what you'd call a switchblade knife. Quite perplexing, this.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Chief! What kind of outfit are you running!?
Judge:
M-Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
How could they miss such a vital piece of evidence!? If your investigators are this lax, how do you expect us to do our job?
Gant:
N-now wait a minute, Worthy!
Edgeworth:
I've no desire to hear your excuses!
Gant:
I'm telling you to wait! Or didn't you hear me?
Edgeworth:
...!
Gant:
Have a look at this document, where it says "person in charge of investigation"... There's no mistaking that signature... Miles Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Th-that's no fair! The day of the crime, I-I had...
Gant:
Your head in the clouds because you got that award! I know how you feel... But you're the person in charge. I'll expect a written apology.
Edgeworth:
What? Are you serious!?
Gant:
Don't be too upset, we'll find a way to clean up this mess... that you made.
Edgeworth:
...!
Ema:
This is the first time I've seen Mr. Edgeworth at a loss for words...
Judge:
This kind of major blunder is unlike you Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Gah...!
Judge:
The court accepts this new evidence. But, I'd like to ask the defense a favor first.
Phoenix:
Y-yes?
Judge:
Just to be sure... I'd like to take a look at the blade of this knife.
Phoenix:
The b-blade, Your Honor? Well, I don't see why not...
Judge:
Could you open it up for me, I wonder?
Phoenix:
Yes, well. I think all you have to do is push that switch, and...
Judge:
If I cut my finger Mr. Wright, I wouldn't be able to pound my gavel anymore.
Phoenix:
(Yeah. But if I cut my finger, I wouldn't be able to point it at people anymore...)
Ema:
Come on! Just hurry up and open it!
Examine evidence
Tag on Switchblade Knife
Ema:
There's a small tag on this knife.
Phoenix:
It seems to say "SL-9 2"...
Ema:
What does that mean?
Phoenix:
Well... (I've heard something similar... "DL-6"... of "DL-6 Incident" fame...)
Ema:
But... it's strange.
Phoenix:
Huh? What is?
Ema:
I'm not certain... But I get the feeling I've seen this somewhere before! Letters like this... or letters that looked a lot like this... somehow.
Tag on Switchblade Knife (after pressing switch)
Ema:
There's a small tag on the knife.
Phoenix:
It says, "SL-9 2."
Ema:
What's that supposed to mean?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure... (But it reminds me of a similar code... "DL-6." Maybe it's a case number?)
Ema:
That's weird.
Phoenix:
What?
Ema:
I don't remember where... but I think I've seen something like this before. Something similar to what's written on this tag. It wasn't that long ago either...
Phoenix:
(Maybe I should check the Court Record again.)
Switch on Switchblade Knife
Ema:
Waaaah! D-don't scare me like that!
Phoenix:
I'm the one who's scared!
Ema:
Look at this knife blade... the tip is broken off.
Phoenix:
(And this dark red stain... blood?)
Switchblade Knife added to the Court Record.
(Examining switch leads to:)
Edgeworth:
This does not excuse the actions of the Police Department! I would like to hear an explanation from the Chief of Police himself!
Judge:
I'm terribly sorry, but could I ask you to testify for us? About the split between the prosecutors and the police... and this knife.
Gant:
Sure! Sure thing. Not a problem, not even a little one! Really!
Witness Testimony
-- Department in Disorder --
Gant:
This knife is special... but I can't say how here.
Unless there's evidence to prove a connection between this knife and Goodman...
That was a bad day for the Department. We weren't in any shape to do an investigation.
A detective was killed at the Police Department, see... what a mess!
The time of the crime? 5:15. Scary coincidence, eh?
It's not officially linked to this here case, so I can't talk much about it.
Judge:
There... There was a murder at the Police Department!? A detective!?
Gant:
That's hush-hush information, Udgey! We haven't exactly announced it yet.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
W-wait a second! You said "5:15"... That's the exact time that Detective Goodman was killed at the Prosecutor's Office!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Gant:
Anyway, we at the Department were all a-flustered, as you might well assume. We're in the middle of a top-top-secret investigation. Don't tell anyone, okay?
Judge:
I think we understand the Police Department's situation... Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Two detectives killed at the same time in two different places...)
Ema:
The chances of that are really slim. Scientifically speaking, of course.
Phoenix:
I'd... like to exercise my right to cross-examine the witness.
Judge:
Very well... however! Keep your questions focused on the case at hand!
Cross Examination
-- Department in Disorder --
Gant:
This knife is special... but I can't say how here.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Excuse me... "special"?
Gant:
Mmhmm. Hard to come by this particular knife anywhere else.
Phoenix:
Um... Might that special thing... be this little tag?
Gant:
Oh! Sorry, Wrighto! But I can't say that now. Not that!
Edgeworth:
We've established that the knife in Goodman's chest... was this knife. Now why was there another knife at the scene of the crime?
Judge:
That's quite a mystery!
Gant:
And like a mystery, it's wrapped in something... a muffler!
Gant:
This knife was evidence in a case. It was stolen from the Department's evidence room.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So this knife... was stolen?
Gant:
Yes, but on the day of the murder.
Edgeworth:
It was evidence, you say. Was it, in fact, a murder weapon?
Gant:
Nice! Nice! Nice! Good show, little Worthy! It was a murder weapon, as it happens. It was evidence from a case long-since solved...
Phoenix:
(So this knife was stolen on the day of the murder... And it was found in the exhaust pipe of Edgeworth's car...)
Ema:
Hard to think there isn't a connection there!
Gant:
Unless there's evidence to prove a connection between this knife and Goodman...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
This knife was found on the scene of our crime! I think that makes it connected to the case, don't you!?
Gant:
See, there's a lot of things that go on at the Department I can't explain... It's... delicate, okay? Sorry, Wrighto!
Ema:
Maybe there's something about the knife that will give us a clue! Let's examine that knife while we can, Wrighto!
Phoenix:
(Hmmm... evidence that links this knife to Detective Goodman... I think perhaps the pieces are falling into place... I should try presenting the piece of evidence that's had me stumped all this time!)
Edgeworth:
So, how were things down at the Department...?
Present Victim's Note
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Wait a second!
Gant:
Ah, at last! An honest to goodness "objection"!
Phoenix:
This knife... This has to have something to do with Detective Goodman!
Judge:
What do you mean!?
Gant:
Ah hah! An honest-to-goodness what do you mean from the judge! This is great!
Phoenix:
Look at the tag on this knife! It reads "SL-9 2"...
Judge:
And this is important... why?
Phoenix:
Over here we also have... A memo that was on the body of the victim!
Judge:
Hmm... what's this? 6 minus 7S... 12/2...?
Phoenix:
Your Honor... It's upside-down.
Judge:
Upside...?
Phoenix:
The printed name on the memo makes it look like it's right-side up... But turn it around and what do you get!?
Judge:
Ah... Ah haaaaah!
Phoenix:
When he wrote this note, he was holding the paper upside down!
Judge:
SL-9... That's the same thing that is written on the knife's tag! Order! Order! Well, Chief?
Gant:
... Ah, well. I guess the cat's out of the bag... You win, Wrighto!
Phoenix:
I... win? Ah... (What game is this guy playing!?)
Change statements:
"This knife is special... but I can't say how here." and "Unless there's evidence to prove a connection between this knife and Goodman..." to "This knife was evidence in a case. It was stolen from the Department's evidence room."
Gant:
That was a bad day for the Department. We weren't in any shape to do an investigation.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Something didn't happen at the Police Department too, did it...?
Gant:
You got a good look in your eyes, there, Wrighto my boy. Sharp! Hungry!
Edgeworth:
Chief... did something happen? And why haven't I heard?
Gant:
Why haven't you heard? Or why didn't you ask?
Edgeworth:
...!
Gant:
No matter, I understand. You were busy, what with Lana's case and all.
Phoenix:
Well, what happened!? What happened at the Police Department that day?
Gant:
A detective was killed at the Police Department, see... what a mess!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
On the same day that a detective was killed in the Prosecutor's parking lot... Another detective... was killed at the Police Department!?
Gant:
That's a fact. Surprising, isn't it, Udgey?
Judge:
I'm at a loss for words.
Edgeworth:
And the perpetrator? Do you have a suspect?
Gant:
Well, there was a suspect. Just arrested 'em, in fact.
Phoenix:
(Just arrested! That was quick...)
Gant:
But... there's still a lot of unanswered questions. Maybe you could help, Wright!
Phoenix:
I suppose I could help... if you help me by giving me data on your case?
Gant:
Oooh, good one! This kid's sharp! Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you one thing and one thing only...
Where the victim was found
Leads to:
"So, tell me... where was the victim found?"
How the victim was killed
Phoenix:
Well, how was the detective killed?
Gant:
How was he killed? Now that's the interesting part! It was what we in the force call a "stabbing." With a knife!
Phoenix:
A kn-knife...?
Edgeworth:
That's exactly the same as Detective Goodman!
Gant:
That's the spirit! We're cooking now! But you know... That's not the only thing that was exactly the same...
Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean!?
Gant:
There were more similarities between the two cases than the cause of death!
Phoenix:
(It seems like I'm going to have to press this a bit harder...)
When the victim died
Phoenix:
So... when did the murder at the Police Department occur?
Gant:
Now that's a sharp question, Wrighto! Very sharp! Well, my boy... You're gonna love this!
Phoenix:
So, tell me... where was the victim found?
Gant:
... Well, I can't speak on where the corpse was found. But I can say the crime took place in the evidence room at the Police Department.
Phoenix:
(The evidence room!?)
Before present Victim's Note at 2nd statement
Gant:
You wouldn't know about the evidence room, would you, Wrighto?
Phoenix:
I can't say I've heard of it. (I guess I should ask again once I learn a bit more about this "evidence room.")
Gant:
There's something stranger about this than the place where the body was found!
After present Victim's Note at 2nd statement
Phoenix:
(W-wait a second... I have heard of that!)
Ema:
The evidence room... Didn't he mention that in his testimony just now?
Gant:
This knife was evidence in a case. It was stolen from the Department's evidence room.
Phoenix:
(There's the connection between the two cases!)
Ema:
You seem happy, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Happy? We just got handed our ticket to go to town on this case! (With the link between the two cases established, we finally have some leverage. Now we can get Gant to testify about the details!)
Gant:
The time of the crime? 5:15. Scary coincidence, eh?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Five... 5:15...!? B-but that's... That's when Detective Goodman was killed in the Prosecutor's Office!
Judge:
What!?
Gant:
Funny, isn't it? A murder at the Prosecutor's place, and a murder at our place at the very same time! What are the chances!
Phoenix:
(Coincidence!?)
Ema:
This is just my gut feeling... but I'd say there's a 0.001% chance of that happening!
Phoenix:
Chief Gant, please tell us more about the incident!
Gant:
It's not officially linked to this here case, so I can't talk much about it.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How can you say there's no connection!?
Gant:
How? Because I'm the Chief of Police! I can't just say anything I please, Wrighto. You understand!
Judge:
Try to understand, Wrighto.
Gant:
Well, if you can prove there is a connection, more power to you. Maybe there is something that ties the two murders together?
Phoenix:
(Whatever it is, I'd better find it and get to the bottom of this!)
Press after fully pressing 4th statement after present Victim's Note at 2nd statement
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Chief... The defense's position is simply this: The connection between these two cases has already been proven!
Gant:
Heh, you don't say? Well, out with it Wrighto! What's your connection?
Judge:
Yes, out with it, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
The connection is a place, mentioned in the testimony we just heard. The knife found in the lot was stolen... from the Police Department's evidence room.
Edgeworth:
Not to mention the victim had written down the numbers on the knife's evidence tag.
Phoenix:
And we also know that the detective murdered at the Police Department... was killed in that very same evidence room!
Judge:
Indeed... There do seem to be too many connections for it to be a coincidence.
Gant:
You two make a good pair. It took my men two days to find out what you deduced right here.
Edgeworth:
Chief! I request that you release your information on the victim at the Police Department!
Gant:
See, that's the tricky part. It hasn't been announced yet, and all...
Phoenix:
Can we get the information... unofficially?
Gant:
Hmmmmm... Sure! Why not? It's unofficial, after all.
Phoenix:
(What? Really!?)
Ema:
Who would have guessed?
Change statement:
"It's not officially linked to this here case, so I can't talk much about it." to "I'll cooperate, but I can't reveal the name of the victim at the Department, okay?"
Gant:
I'll cooperate, but I can't reveal the name of the victim at the Department, okay?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
If you're going to tell us a little, why not tell us everything?
Gant:
Ah, well, case information is sticky stuff. You have to do everything properly.
Phoenix:
(Oh well... I guess I might as well try to get what I can out of him...)
The victim's division
Phoenix:
Okay, well... What division was the victim stationed in?
Gant:
Oh? You want to know that, do you? Do you? Ah hah... Criminal Affairs, Division 1. The detectives responsible for homicide cases.
Phoenix:
(Homicide... that would be the same division as Detective Gumshoe!)
Ema:
Detective Goodman who was killed in the underground parking lot was homicide, too!
Phoenix:
It's almost like a serial killer was after homicide detectives...
Ema:
Except that the serial killing happened simultaneously, scientifically speaking.
Phoenix:
Well, I sure hope Detective Gumshoe isn't next on the list...
The victim's ID number
Leads to:
"Okay... How about you tell me the victim's ID number?"
The victim's gender
Phoenix:
Okay... how about the gender of the victim!
Gant:
You want to know that!? Um... Hmm... Okay, a hint. Let's see... first hint! The gender that's NOT female...!
Phoenix:
Ah hah! He was a guy!
Gant:
What did I tell you! The boy's sharp!
Judge:
Stop goofing around, Mr. Wright! This is serious business!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor. (Hey, tell that to the Chief of Police!)
Phoenix:
Okay... How about you tell me the victim's ID number?
Gant:
Hmm? Sure, why not. It's not like you'll be able to tell who it is from that!
Phoenix:
Of course not. You won't tell me their name, after all.
Gant:
We keep a tight lid on ID numbers, so don't go getting your hopes up. The number is... 5842189.
Judge:
Well! That's quite... long!
Gant:
And we have to remember these! It drives me nuts!
Judge:
8... 2... I can't do it.
Phoenix:
(You didn't even get the first number right!)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Does this tell you anything?
Phoenix:
(The ID number of the victim at the Police Department... 5842189...)
This tells me something!
Leads to:
"Actually, it does, Your Honor."
This tells me nothing!
Phoenix:
Absolutely nothing, Your Honor.
Judge:
Ah... well, yes.
Phoenix:
First of all, it was too long! I've forgotten it already!
Judge:
S-sorry! I mean, why are you getting mad at me!? I didn't come up with those numbers...
Ema:
Hmm... 5842189...
Phoenix:
Actually, it does, Your Honor. It does...! I think!
Judge:
Meaning?
Phoenix:
(It has to be what I think it is... But what does this mean?)
Judge:
Well, let's hear what the defense has to say. You say the ID number of the detective who was murdered at the Police Department... tells you something? What does it tell you!?
Present Goodman's ID
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Witness!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The ID number tells me...&#160;this!
Gant:
My dear boy, you shouldn't believe everything ID numbers tell you.
Phoenix:
Well... Maybe I misheard. You know?
Judge:
Mr. Wright.... The court respectfully requests that you clean out your ears and pay attention!
Phoenix:
(And I'd like to request some straightforward information for once!)
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Don't listen to them! Look at the Court Record, scientifically!
Phoenix:
(Two detectives were killed at 5:15... One at the Prosecutor's Office... And one at the Police Department... that can't be a coincidence!)
Ema:
And that knife! What was it doing there...?
Phoenix:
(I'd better check this knife out...)
Phoenix:
Witness! ...
Gant:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
... What is it, Mr. Wright!? You're grinning like a schoolgirl on prom night!
Phoenix:
No, I... it's just, I got confused...
Edgeworth:
And this is news?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Just come out with both guns blazing... like you always do.
Phoenix:
(The Police Department... the Prosecutor's Office... Two places, two detectives murdered... at one time.) Actually, I happen to have a police ID number here.
Judge:
Oh hoh! Is it yours?
Phoenix:
N-no, Your Honor. I'm a defense attorney... remember? This is the ID number of our victim, Detective Goodman.
Gant:
Shame on you, Wrighto! Personnel IDs are top secret!
Phoenix:
Detective Goodman's ID number is... "5842189."
Gant:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
... And...? This means... what, exactly?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
Wait... That ID number we heard from the Chief earlier.. That started with "82..." Hmm. I've forgotten.
Phoenix:
(You even got the first number wrong!) The number the Chief of Police gave us was... 5842189.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
W-wait a second, Wright! What does this...?
Phoenix:
Mean? That's what I want to know! The two ID numbers are identical! In other words... The detective killed in the Police Department's evidence room was Bruce Goodman!
Phoenix:
What does our witness think about that!?
Gant:
... Oh! Ho ho ho, sharp as a tack, Wrighto! Sharp as a tack!
Judge:
B-but wait! Detective Goodman is OUR victim! He was killed at 5:15 in the underground parking lot!
Phoenix:
Yet, a Detective Bruce Goodman was also killed at the Police Department... In the evidence room... at the exact same time!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Th-that's impossible! So, what we're saying is... The same person was killed at the same time!? And in a completely different location!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Chief! What does this mean!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!No... what I want to know is... why didn't I hear about this!? Yes, it's top-secret, fine! But I'm the prosecutor in charge of the case!!!
Gant:
Now, just wait a second, Worthy. No need to get all flustered.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! The Police Department has made a grave error in this case...
Gant:
Wait. I said "wait." Or didn't you hear me?
Edgeworth:
...!
Gant:
The oversight... the grave error...? Mr. Edgeworth... They're yours.
Edgeworth:
Wh-what!?&#160;How... how dare...
Gant:
We informed you yesterday. I believe it was our Officer Meekins who brought you the news?
Edgeworth:
O-officer... Meekins?
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Where have we heard that name before? Wait... Ah hah!
Officer:
Erm...! Excuse me! But is Mr. Edgeworth, uh... anywhere on the premises? I'm here, sir, at the request of the chief, sir! I've got your report, sir!
Edgeworth:
You don't mean... him!?
Gant:
According to Meekins, you didn't accept the report?
Gant:
Hard to believe.
Edgeworth:
B-but your officer, he told me! He said that report had nothing to do with the Lana Skye incident!
Gant:
[Detective Bruce Goodman murdered in the Police Department evidence room...] Mr. Edgeworth. The victim's name is written right on the top of the report.
Edgeworth:
Gaaaaaaah! Wh-why didn't your officer tell me!?
Ema:
Honestly, I'm not sure if that officer was capable of making the connection... He did seem... challenged.
Gant:
In any case, this is a serious error, a gross negligence of duty on your part, Worthy.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
B-But, sir!!! You could have submitted that report this morning to the court, as evidence! Then, I...
Gant:
No such luck this time, Worthy... or should I say, un-Worthy?
Edgeworth:
What!?
Gant:
Now what was the second rule of evidence law, hmm?
Ema:
Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, well, it's, uh...
Edgeworth:
Rule 2: New evidence may only be submitted if it concerns the case on trial. And how is this relevant!?
Gant:
Normally, you submit a list of evidence to be used in court before the trial. This report wasn't on that list...
Judge:
So... What does this mean?
Gant:
I couldn't submit this evidence until a connection was proven in court.
Edgeworth:
...!!
Gant:
That connection was just proven by Wrighto over here. Good job, Wrighto, my boy!
Phoenix:
Huh? Uh... I... I was just doing my job.
Edgeworth:
No... Noooooooooooooo!!!
Judge:
It seems... we have come to the end of this trial.
Gant:
You are becoming a thorn in my side, Worthy... There've been rumors... After all, you were in the defendant's chair just last year...!
Edgeworth:
...! I apologize for this terrible lack of due diligence on my part...
Judge:
M-Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Please... Just give me one day. I'll get to the bottom of what happened... If it's the last thing I do!
Gant:
You'd better get results this time. Really.
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
Ema:
Poor Mr. Edgeworth...
Judge:
I don't think there's ever been an error this serious in the history of this court. We will grant one further day as the prosecution has requested. Will this be sufficient, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor. Thank you.
Judge:
Whatever your punishment for this is, for your sake I hope it's not... decisive. Very well! Court is adjourned!
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over
