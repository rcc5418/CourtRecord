Phoenix:
...Welcome to court. Seven years... all leading to one verdict. A verdict which you must decide. Is the defendant, Vera Misham, innocent... or guilty? The courtroom doors are opening... the trial awaits. Are you ready to begin?

...Something inside me... rising... surfacing... ...Something important... lost long ago... it's close now... so close.
October 9, 10:00 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Vera Misham.
Examine evidence
Nail Polish
Bottom
Apollo:
The nail polish Mr. Wright gave me. This must be the brand symbol. It's an "A", drawn like a flower. It's refreshing to see a brand with a simple, clear design like this.
Letter From Misham
Stamp
Apollo:
This stamp... It's of the Gramaryes, Isn't it? Why did Mr. Wright give me this letter right before the trial? What could it mean...?
Front side
Apollo:
There's an address on here... And a name I've never heard of. At least, I think so... It's too blurry to read.
Apollo:
...The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Klavier:
...Prosecution's ready to rock.
Judge:
Prosecutor Gavin. How is the defendant... Vera Misham's condition?
Klavier:
Acute atroquinine poisoning. According to her physician... ...she could die at any time. Thus... her absence from the courtroom today.
Trucy:
What!? They can't put her on trial without her being here!
Apollo:
It... is unusual.
Trucy:
They should wait for her to get better and do it then. ...It's so bureaucratic of them!
Apollo:
That's being a little harsh. (They can't delay the trial any longer. ...Or they risk having no one left to try.)
Klavier:
A trial without a verdict can only cause grief... ...The records of this case, and experience, tell us this. ...Apologies to the defendant, but the show must go on.
Apollo:
(Right... if Vera dies, the trial will be cancelled. ...I'm not going to let that happen! Mr. Wright told me everything that's been going on behind the curtain all these years. I'm going to get Vera her innocent verdict while there's still time!)
Judge:
...Very well. Your opening statement, Prosecutor Gavin.
Klavier:
The prosecution's case is unchanged by recent events. Why did Vera Misham succumb to poison? Because she couldn't live with the guilt of what she'd done.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
But Vera was poisoned with atroquinine! The exact same poison that took her father's life!
Klavier:
...What better confession could you ask for? Being the killer she would have had access to the poison. Significant, since it's rather hard to come by.
Judge:
Hmm... That is true.
Klavier:
In other words... I see no need for further discussion. We could have had our verdict... yesterday.
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? If you have no objections, I see no reason to postpone a verdict.
Apollo:
...What we need to worry about isn't the verdict... but the trial itself! The defense holds that Vera Misham is the victim not the killer!
Klavier:
If that's so... then you have to prove something. She was in court, giving her testimony before us. How do you propose her "killer" poisoned her? Oh... and incidentally, it would be nice if you told us who her mystery "killer" was.
Judge:
...The prosecution's objection is sustained. I ask the defense to prove its claims to this court. Tell us how Vera Misham was "poisoned"!
Apollo:
(...I've got two things to prove here. Who did it, and how. Which to hit first?)
Show "how"
Apollo:
How did the killer poison Vera Misham...? I will focus first on the method used.
Judge:
Hmm... Any comments before we begin, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
Not a bottle or container of the poison was found on the defendant's body.
Judge:
I see... So the vector of poisoning is unknown. Is the defense prepared to prove how the poison reached Vera Misham?
Apollo:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well. What method was used to poison Vera Misham?
Present Nail Polish
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"What's this...? My, what a beautiful bottle."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
From what I hear... ...atroquinine takes a while before it acts on the body.
Klavier:
Yes. "Slow acting", it's called.
Judge:
Also from what I hear... ...my penalties hurt more later than at the moment they're given. ...But let's find out!
Apollo:
(OK, I'm wrong, I get it.)
Trucy:
They've really made an art out of this penalty thing.
Leads back to:
"Very well."
Judge:
What's this...? My, what a beautiful bottle. I'd like to give whoever designed that a hand.
Klavier:
Is that... nail polish? Hmm, it's colorless. Ah...!
Apollo:
Something the matter?
Klavier:
N-No. Nothing. Nothing at all.
Judge:
So the killer put poison in this bottle, and made her drink it?
Apollo:
As Prosecutor Gavin has told us, this is nail polish.
Judge:
Nail polish...?
Apollo:
...It's like paint for nails. Know any women with red nails?
Judge:
Ah! My wife has red nails! I see... so she's been painting them all this time!
Apollo:
Let's recall yesterday's trial. Remember when Vera was testifying to the court?
Judge:
Court is now back in session.
Vera:
......
Apollo:
(Vera seems pretty tense. She's practically chewing her fingernails clean off!)
Apollo:
Whenever Vera became nervous, she had a habit... ...of biting her nails.
Judge:
Her nails... Aaah!
Apollo:
...Prosecutor Gavin? When the prosecution had Vera examined, did they check her nails?
Klavier:
I... Well I...
Judge:
Bailiff! Have them check the defendant's nails at once! ...Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
...Yes?
Judge:
Do you know who did this? Do you know who put poison in that nail polish!?
Apollo:
...Yes.
Klavier:
That bottle... belongs to Vera Misham?
Apollo:
Why do you ask? Know someone else who might have a bottle like this?
Klavier:
...... No. Just checking.
Judge:
Mr. Justice. You are about to accuse someone of poisoning that bottle of nail polish! Please dispense with the chatter. You realize the weight of this accusation? Here, let me show you.
Apollo:
...Understood, Your Honor. (No problem. I know what I'm doing this time.)
Judge:
Then let us ask! Who poisoned Vera Misham via her nail polish!?
Present Kristoph Gavin profile
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Wh-What's this? Kristoph Gavin...?"
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
Hmm... I'm having a little trouble following your reasoning. Any insights, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
It is clear just who is poisonous here. Herr Forehead is poisoning the hearts and minds of this court!
Judge:
...Very well. Then let's fight poison, with penalty!
Apollo:
(...No slouching now, Justice! This is my chance to drag the real killer out into the light of day! I know who gave Vera that bottle!)
Leads back to:
"Then let us ask!"
Judge:
Wh-What's this? Kristoph Gavin...?
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...What's your game? My bro... There's no way he could do a thing like that! You should know that better than anyone else!
Judge:
Indeed... ...He is behind bars.
Apollo:
...I know. However... ...that doesn't mean it was impossible to do what he did.
Klavier:
What...?
Apollo:
Ask yourselves "when" he put the poison in the bottle. It could have been yesterday. ...It could have been a month ago. Maybe it was a year ago? ...Or perhaps, it was seven years ago.
Judge:
B-But...! Kristoph Gavin had no motive for killing this poor girl!
Leads to:
"...It's simply inconceivable!"
Show "who"
Apollo:
Just who poisoned Vera Misham? I have a name for you.
Klavier:
Just a moment, Herr Forehead. You are aware this is an accusation you're making? I think a bit of risk is in order. This much, to be precise.
Apollo:
...I understand. (No problem. I know what I'm doing this time.)
Judge:
Then let's hear it! Who poisoned Vera Misham?
Present Kristoph Gavin profile
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Wh-What's this? Kristoph Gavin...?"
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
Hmm... I'm not sure I entirely understand. Do you understand, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
It is clear just who is poisonous here. Herr Forehead is poisoning the hearts and minds of this court!
Judge:
...Very well. Then let's fight poison, with penalty!
Apollo:
(...No slouching now, Justice! This is my chance to drag the real killer out into the light of day! I know who gave Vera that bottle!)
Leads back to:
"Then let's hear it!"
Judge:
Wh-What's this? Kristoph Gavin...?
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...What's your game? My bro... There's no way he could do a thing like that! You should know that better than anyone else!
Judge:
Indeed... ...He is behind bars.
Apollo:
...I know. However... ...that doesn't mean it was impossible to do what he did.
Klavier:
What...?
Apollo:
Kristoph Gavin had the opportunity to poison Vera Misham!
Judge:
Apparently, the defense has something in mind. Let's see what it is! How did Kristoph Gavin, currently in solitary confinement, poison her!?
Present Nail Polish
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"What's this...? My, what a beautiful bottle."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
From what I hear... ...atroquinine takes a while before it acts on the body.
Klavier:
Yes. "Slow-acting", it's called.
Judge:
Also from what I hear... ...my penalties hurt more later than at the moment they're given. ...But let's find out!
Apollo:
(OK, I'm wrong, I get it.)
Trucy:
They've really made an art out of this penalty thing.
Leads back to:
"How did Kristoph Gavin, currently in solitary confinement, poison her!?"
Judge:
What's this...? My, what a beautiful bottle. I'd like to give whoever designed that a hand.
Klavier:
Is that... nail polish? Hmm, it's colorless. Ah...!
Apollo:
Something the matter?
Klavier:
N-No. Nothing. Nothing at all.
Judge:
So the killer put poison in this bottle, and made her drink it?
Apollo:
As Prosecutor Gavin has told us, this is nail polish.
Judge:
Nail polish...?
Apollo:
...It's like paint for nails. Know any women with red nails?
Judge:
Ah! My wife has red nails! I see... so she's been painting them all this time!
Apollo:
Let's recall yesterday's trial. Remember when Vera was testifying to the court?
Judge:
Court is now back in session.
Vera:
......
Apollo:
(Vera seems pretty tense. She's practically chewing her fingernails clean off!)
Apollo:
Whenever Vera became nervous, she had a habit... ...of biting her nails.
Judge:
Her nails... Aaah!
Apollo:
...Prosecutor Gavin? When the prosecution had Vera examined, did they check her nails?
Klavier:
I... Well I...
Judge:
Bailiff! Have them check the defendant's nails at once!
Apollo:
Kristoph Gavin didn't have to "poison" that bottle the day of the poisoning, Your Honor! The moment Vera first held that bottle in her hand, her fate was sealed!
Judge:
B-But wait! This business about Kristoph Gavin giving her that bottle is only conjecture!
Leads to:
"...It's simply inconceivable!"
Judge:
...It's simply inconceivable!
Apollo:
...Prosecutor Gavin doesn't seem to think so.
Klavier:
......
Apollo:
...That face tells me one thing. Kristoph Gavin's own younger brother doesn't find it inconceivable at all.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Prosecutor Gavin? If you feel there is a clear and pressing need... ...then we may have to summon Kristoph Gavin from jail as a special witness.
Klavier:
...... Fine. I've known for some time that an impenetrable darkness lurked at the bottom of this. ...A darkness that has swallowed even myself.
Apollo:
......
Klavier:
...OK. The defense's wish is granted. Let prisoner Kristoph Gavin take the stand!
Judge:
Bailiff, begin proceedings to call a special witness! The witness is Kristoph Gavin, currently residing in Solitary Cell 13 at Central Prison!
Kristoph:
...Ah, Your Honor. How nice to see you again.
Judge:
I-It's been quite a while, hasn't it?
Kristoph:
To what do I owe the pleasure of your company? It's not every day I'm summoned from my solitary cell. In fact, it's never.
Apollo:
I think you already know, Mister Kristoph Gavin.
Kristoph:
Ah... Mr. Justice. ...I hear you've been doing quite well for yourself.
Apollo:
(Ack... Why do I feel like somehow, he's still my boss...?)
Trucy:
Stiff upper lip, Apollo! You can do it!
Apollo:
...Does this bottle look familiar?
Kristoph:
Ariadoney nail polish? ...Why yes, I use it myself. As did the late defendant, I hear.
Apollo:
She's not dead yet!
Kristoph:
And...? Was there something concerning this bottle you wished to ask me about? I admit, I respect her for her taste in nail polish.
Apollo:
Her "taste" indeed! This nail polish was how Vera Misham was poisoned!
Kristoph:
Atroquinine... was it?
Judge:
You're well informed about the case, Mr. Gavin.
Kristoph:
Even in solitary, much comes to my desk. And I have nothing to do but read. ...Well, Klavier?
Klavier:
...!
Kristoph:
...Maybe you can explain this?
Klavier:
...... You're being accused again. ...By him. Again.
Kristoph:
Ahh. And? You agree with his accusation, do you?
Klavier:
......
Judge:
Let's hold a proper trial, shall we? Kristoph Gavin... your testimony, please.
Kristoph:
...I'd be delighted.
Judge:
The charges against you are quite severe, Mr. Gavin. You are suspected of the poisoning of the defendant, Vera Misham... ...Please testify on this matter to the court!
Witness Testimony
-- Poisoning Vera --
Kristoph:
Owning the same nail polish does not a murderer make.I have been in solitary confinement for half a year. How could I poison her?Her father died of the same poison... the meaning of which should be clear.The prosecution's case holds. She poisoned her father, then attempted to poison herself.Surely, you aren't going to suggest I was responsible for poisoning her father, too?
Judge:
Well... ...I'm afraid the defense's claim is sounding rather unlikely.
Kristoph:
Naturally. For one, I don't even know the Mishams. Isn't that so, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
......
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Justice, begin your cross-examination.
Apollo:
(I'm accusing Kristoph Gavin, my ex-boss. But I know he poisoned the Mishams! The question is "when" could he have done it...? Not to mention... "why"?)
Cross Examination
-- Poisoning Vera --
Kristoph:
Owning the same nail polish does not a murderer make.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Tell me, is this nail polish expensive?
Kristoph:
Ariadoney is a nail polish of the highest order. Not only is it fabulously expensive, but it is made in extremely limited quantities.
Apollo:
And you, and Vera, just happen to both use it? That can't be a coincidence!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
I'm guessing it's not a coincidence.
Apollo:
Huh?
Klavier:
It's simple. Ariadoney is the best nail polish one can buy, correct? Then, if one wanted the best nail polish, one would buy it.
Judge:
...That makes sense! Why, it's a bit like my feelings toward my brand-name gavel here.
Trucy:
And my silk top hat!
Apollo:
(Are we all done showing off our refined tastes?)
Judge:
...Please, continue with your tasteful testimony.
Kristoph:
I have been in solitary confinement for half a year. How could I poison her?
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Can't you still make contact with the outside world in solitary?
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Ah, so he had an accomplice on the outside? Is this your latest accusation?
Kristoph:
I am allowed a certain modicum of letter writing.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
But the contents of those letters are closely checked. It would be extremely difficult to send a hit request!
Trucy:
...Prosecutor Gavin's on the warpath, isn't he?
Apollo:
Yeah... You think so, too, Trucy?
Trucy:
I bet I know why. He must be nervous with big brother watching!
Apollo:
(Hmm... And maybe that's a weakness I can turn to my advantage...)
Kristoph:
Are we "cool" with that? May I continue?
Kristoph:
Her father died of the same poison... the meaning of which should be clear.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
The defendant is not dead yet!
Kristoph:
There are no known cases of someone surviving atroquinine poisoning.
Apollo:
You seem to know a lot about atroquinine.
Kristoph:
I know a lot about a lot of things. Which is why I suggest we pick up the pace. Or else, you'll be short one defendant, for what she's worth.
Judge:
The witness will refrain from speaking ill of the... ill!
Kristoph:
...My apologies. Shall I continue?
Kristoph:
The prosecution's case holds. She poisoned her father, then attempted to poison herself.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Vera had no reason to want to commit suicide! And also... ...who would commit suicide by doing their nails!?
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
The answer's quite simple. Basically...
Kristoph:
...Allow me to explain, beginning with, "Why did she do it?" The answer's quite simple. She couldn't live with her own guilt. Next, "Why did she use nail polish to poison herself?" This, too, is simple. So she could die doing something that she liked.
Apollo:
"Something that she liked"...?
Kristoph:
Once she saw that the trial wasn't going her way, she knew she would die. And, it's not easy to bring poison into a courtroom. ...Must I explain further?
Judge:
Hmm... I believe that's clear enough. Crystal clear.
Trucy:
Wow, the two brothers together is like a two-man wrecking team!
Apollo:
They could use a little more teamwork, though.
Kristoph:
Surely, you aren't going to suggest I was responsible for poisoning her father, too?
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Both Vera and Mr. Misham were poisoned with atroquinine. That really can't be a coincidence.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
The defense is repeating fallacious statements based on conjecture! The prosecution requests concrete, unambiguous proof of the witness's crime!
Judge:
O-Objection sustained. The defense will please present concrete proof.
Trucy:
Does Prosecutor Gavin seem strange to you, too? It's like he's all grown-up...
Apollo:
I think that's how prosecutors are supposed to be, actually. (Though he is acting different than usual... ...I'll bet it has a lot to do with his brother Kristoph being in the room...)
Trucy:
Well, let's make this testimony count, Apollo!
Apollo:
Right. Quick and painless. (...My bracelet should do the trick!)
Perceive "Devil" hand on "her father, too?"
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Leads to:
"It was you who killed Drew Misham."
Apollo:
(OK... I'm questioning my ex-boss. His testimony seems water-tight... but he's lying. I'm sure I'll be able to see something... as long as I focus!)
Apollo:
It was you who killed Drew Misham.
Kristoph:
...A bluff worthy of your new mentor, Mr. Wright.
Apollo:
Oh, really? ...But you see, I saw it. Right when you said "her father, too"! Your hand tensed unnaturally, and a little devil appeared to give me the news.
Kristoph:
...... And? Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that you saw me being "tense". What does that mean? Are all tense witnesses guilty? And tell me, was Drew Misham fond of nail polish, too?
Apollo:
...Sorry, but there's more than one way to poison a man. You don't need nail polish to get to someone's mouth.
Kristoph:
Ah, then I must be very talented indeed. You see, Drew Misham was killed on October 6... ...while I was already in my solitary confinement cell at Central Prison. If that's not an alibi, then I don't know what is.
Apollo:
...But you found a way, all the same. And I found it, too.
Kristoph:
...!
Apollo:
This is how you poisoned Mr. Misham!
Present Commemorative Stamp
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I'm sure this commemorative stamp requires no introduction."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Kristoph:
...My, my. And here I thought you'd come so far.
Apollo:
Huh...?
Kristoph:
I admire how you, lacking any confidence whatsoever, choose to barrel on. Your defense lacks even a shred of elegance. ...Much like Phoenix Wright, come to think of it.
Apollo:
(...Relax, Justice. I've come this far, I must know the answer... ...How did the killer get to his victim, when the killer was in jail...?)
Leads back to:
"This is how you poisoned Mr. Misham!"
Apollo:
I'm sure this commemorative stamp requires no introduction.
Kristoph:
......
Apollo:
The night Mr. Misham died, he was seen writing a letter. Atroquinine was found on this stamp, Mr. Gavin.
Kristoph:
So am I to understand this stamp was the murder weapon?
Apollo:
Yes, you are. Oh, and yes... ...this stamp was found in your prison cell!!!
Kristoph:
...!
Apollo:
...That is all, Your Honor.
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! P-Poison on the back of that stamp!?
Apollo:
After Drew Misham was killed, someone paid a visit to this witness's cell. ...Phoenix Wright.
Trucy:
Daddy...?
Apollo:
That's when he found the stamp. You made Drew Misham write you a letter! That's how you killed him!
Klavier:
What...!?
Kristoph:
My, my. You've upset my poor brother to the point of uselessness. Allow me to clarify this matter, Justice. All you need do is recall witness Spark Brushel's testimony.
Brushel:
Well, that's the thing, see. After he put his letter in that envelope... ...Mr. Misham sat there searching his desk drawer for something!
Apollo:
His desk drawer...?
Brushel:
Yes! A stamp! A so-called "Postage Stamp", end quote!
Kristoph:
He was "looking for a stamp". Ergo, he had no intention of using this stamp.
Apollo:
What are you getting at?
Kristoph:
What I'm arriving at is that this commemorative stamp was in a frame! It was mere coincidence that he used it that night!
Judge:
That would... seem to be the case.
Kristoph:
Or perhaps you mean to suggest that I can somehow manipulate coincidence?
Apollo:
...!
Judge:
He does have a point. How would this witness know if the victim was going to use that stamp? Without that, he couldn't have planned the murder!
Apollo:
Wh-Whaaaaat!?
Kristoph:
...Really, Klavier. You should be seeing through these weak-spined bluffs by now.
Klavier:
......
Apollo:
(He's right, though... ...How could anyone have known Mr. Misham would use that stamp that night? Least of all Kristoph Gavin locked away in his cell...)
Judge:
Well... ...it seems that the defense has run out of things to say.
Kristoph:
You assume he had something to say in the first place. I believe the defense's bluff... has been called.
Klavier:
The "defense's bluff"...? I'm not sure I agree with you there... Kristoph.
Kristoph:
K-Klavier...?
Klavier:
...Honestly, I wanted to believe you. But the defense wasn't trying to get away with a bluff. You were, Kristoph!
Judge:
Wh-What are you saying? ...Prosecutor Gavin!
Klavier:
...Herr Forehead. What was your accusation again...?
Apollo:
Huh!? Oh, it was that...
Klavier:
..."This poisoned stamp killed Drew Misham"... ja? To which my brother responded thusly: "There was no way to know "when" Misham would use the stamp."
Judge:
Yes, that's right. Which is why it couldn't have been planned...
Klavier:
...Tell me. It needs to be "planned"... why?
Apollo:
Uh...
Klavier:
Why couldn't it have been a "coincidence"? The defense's case is simply that Drew Misham died by that stamp. That's all.
Apollo:
"Coincidence"...
Klavier:
Kristoph, you tried to slip out from under his accusation by changing the subject! If that's not bluffing... what is it?
Kristoph:
...... What are you up to, Klavier?
Klavier:
I could ask you the same question, Kristoph.
Kristoph:
Heh... ...I silenced the defense with the fewest words possible. It's called "efficiency".
Judge:
B-But Mr. Gavin! That's impermissible testimony!
Kristoph:
...Very well. I shall take his claim head-on, then. ...Justice.
Apollo:
Wh-What?
Kristoph:
You accuse me of Drew Misham's murder, yes? Then, allow me to ask you: What possible reason could I have to kill a painter?
Trucy:
Apollo! Motive! He's talking about a motive!
Judge:
Hmm... Indeed. It's hard to see how an attorney could come to want to kill a painter.
Apollo:
(Now here's something: why didn't he bring up the motive from the very beginning? ...Unless he was afraid it was a battle he might lose...!)
Trucy:
So... what does it mean?
Apollo:
...It means there might be a weak spot! Maybe I have some evidence to prove a motive...
Judge:
A motive for murder. This is a vital, if not the most vital element in this case. Please consider this when making your statement.
Klavier:
I'd say it's about... this vital.
Apollo:
(That's... pretty vital.)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
(I'm going through with this no matter what!) ...Understood, Your Honor. I'd like to present evidence.
Kristoph:
......
Judge:
Then, let's see what you have for us. What reason did Kristoph Gavin have for wanting to murder Drew Misham?
Present Red Envelope or Notebook Page
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Kristoph Gavin's motive becomes clear..."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Kristoph:
...... Bravo, Justice.
Apollo:
Hmm...?
Kristoph:
The way you present erroneous evidence with such numbing lack of skill. To think changing mentors would cripple you so.
Judge:
Allow me to present you with a numbing penalty.
Trucy:
Hang in there, Apollo!
Apollo:
(Drew Misham had another "business" besides painting. Add a "lawyer" to that... and the puzzle is complete.)
Apollo:
Your Honor! I'm plenty numb now... Can I try again?
Leads back to:
"Then, let's see what you have for us."
Apollo:
Kristoph Gavin's motive becomes clear... ...when we consider why the stamp came to Drew Misham's studio in the first place.
Judge:
And why was that?
Apollo:
Forgery, Your Honor. Go back seven years. Drew Misham accepts his first job creating forged evidence.
Judge:
I've... seen that before! A page from a diary, wasn't it? Magnifi Gramarye's diary.
Kristoph:
Ah, when attorney Phoenix Wright lost his badge, yes. ...This was the "evidence" he presented. To his loss.
Apollo:
...This evidence is a fake, yes. But did Mr. Wright request the forgery be made? That was never proven!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
The defense attorney on that case was Phoenix Wright. Who, other than him, drunk with the prospect of victory, could have done it? And why would they?
Apollo:
...... Just out of curiosity... ...do you remember this letter? This is the first page. ...And this is the second.
Judge:
Those were presented in court yesterday. This letter was sent to Drew Misham by the client who requested that forgery.
Apollo:
The "enclosed stamp" was none other than the poisoned commemorative stamp! Drew Misham drew his last breath just the other day. However! The motive for his murder was already seven years old!
Klavier:
Seven years old...?
Apollo:
The client who requested this forgery was very cautious. He tried to erase anything... and anyone with connections to the forgery!
Judge:
...To keep them from talking?
Apollo:
...But he made a mistake.
Vera:
...The stamp was a picture of my favorite magicians... so I kept it...
Vera:
...Father took me when I was very young... ...It was a great magic show. I loved it so much...
Apollo:
...The killer's "time bomb" was delayed. The poisoned stamp was sealed within a glass frame... ...where it sat for seven whole years.
Klavier:
...Herr Forehead. Do you understand what you're telling us?
Apollo:
......
Klavier:
The one who schemed up the forged diary page was the one who poisoned the stamp. And it was Phoenix Wright who presented the forged evidence seven years ago. Adding the two statements together, the one who schemed to kill Drew Misham... ...was none other than Phoenix Wright!
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
...Sorry, but that's not how this is going to go down.
Klavier:
Oh? Then how will it "go down"?
Apollo:
I checked through the records on that case... when I found this. ...Seven years ago, just before the trial began...
Trucy:
Oh... Old boy! Um, uh... Here.
Phoenix:
What's this...?
Trucy:
I dunno! I just got it over there in the hall. They told me to give it to the "old boy in the blue suit with the spiky hair".
Apollo:
And one more thing...
Enigmar:
I'm... sorry to have sprung this on you so suddenly.
Phoenix:
I received the files from your previous attorney only yesterday.
Enigmar:
...I understand I am asking the impossible of you.
Phoenix:
Yes, well, you haven't really told me what happened yet! All we did... was play cards.
Enigmar:
And that was enough.
Apollo:
Phoenix Wright was put on the case the day before the trial started. He didn't have time to request a forgery!
Klavier:
The day before...!?
Apollo:
Now here's a question. Just who was Shadi Enigmar's previous defense attorney?
Kristoph:
......
Klavier:
No... Th-This can't all be...
Apollo:
...But it is all true. There was another man, a defense attorney with a badge on his collar... ...it was you! Kristoph Gavin!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! W-What is the meaning of this, witness! I mean, defendant! Er, former lawyer!?
Kristoph:
...Let me begin by denying this.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
It's easy enough to look up, Mr. Gavin.
Kristoph:
And impossible to prove if you can't.
Apollo:
...!
Kristoph:
Attorneys are registered with the court the day before the trial begins. In other words, no record remains in the court. How exactly did you intend to prove Phoenix Wright's claim?
Judge:
Hmm... That would be difficult. I'm afraid this line of inquiry won't yield...
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...Herr Forehead. Are you sure you don't have evidence...?
Apollo:
...!
Trucy:
What's wrong with Prosecutor Gavin? He looks clammy!
Klavier:
Evidence! Evidence that shows this man, Kristoph Gavin, requested that forgery seven years ago!
Kristoph:
Klavier...?
Klavier:
Just... prove it! Clear up these doubts now, or I swear, I'm off this case!
Trucy:
...He must have thought of some evidence, Apollo!
Apollo:
(Prosecutor Gavin looks like he's in physical pain! That darkness... ...I have to pull that darkness out of him... And proof is the only way I can! What proves Kristoph Gavin's link to Drew Misham!?)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? You claim Kristoph Gavin requested a forgery of Drew Misham seven years ago! Prove it!
Apollo:
It can be proven.
Kristoph:
...... Simply ridiculous. Why even discuss it? This "evidence" does not...
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Are you... telling the truth, Apollo Justice...?
Apollo:
...I am.
Klavier:
Then... I say we give him the benefit of the doubt!
Judge:
Very well. But, if you're wrong about this... ...be prepared for a penalty.
Kristoph:
Objection!
Kristoph:
Your Honor. You do the defense an injustice. Mr. Justice is clearly passionate about his claim. Should the penalty not match his passion?
Judge:
I... haven't given a penalty like that in a long time. Well? Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
...Fine, Your Honor. (All I have to prove is any kind of link. Something that ties Kristoph Gavin to Drew Misham... And... I have something that clearly does the job.)
Judge:
...Very well, Mr. Justice. Present your evidence! Show us the link between our witness and Drew Misham!
Present Letter from Misham
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This evidence proves there's a link!"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
Hmm... What say you, Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
Ah, yes... What was your name again? Apollo Justice?
Apollo:
...Your point?
Kristoph:
I was thinking you should have it changed to "Forgery". ...It suits you far, far better.
Trucy:
Forgery Justice...? That's not so bad!
Apollo:
(In other words... wrong evidence.)
Judge:
Most unfortunate. Might I suggest changing it to "Penalty Justice"?
Klavier:
Way to go, Herr Pen!
Apollo:
(Great, a new nickname already. Time to rethink my evidence... carefully!)
Leads back to:
"...Very well, Mr. Justice. Present your evidence!"
Apollo:
This evidence proves there's a link!
Kristoph:
Objection!
Kristoph:
That... scrap of paper? I'm afraid I can't let you submit that.
Apollo:
...Is there some problem?
Kristoph:
There is. How could you possibly have that? You couldn't.
Apollo:
Hmm...?
Trucy:
Hey! That's Daddy's handwriting...
Judge:
...Mr. Wright's handwriting!? What is the meaning of this?
Kristoph:
Ah, I see now. Yes, of course.
Judge:
What do you mean "of course"?
Kristoph:
I just remembered I had a visitor yesterday. Phoenix Wright came to my cell... except I wasn't there.
Klavier:
Phoenix Wright...?
Kristoph:
When I returned, I saw he had something of mine in his possession. Of course, I had no intention of letting him get away with reading my private mail.
Judge:
Mail...? You mean, this letter was in your cell?
Kristoph:
...No. However, it appears Mr. Wright has yet to be cured of his bad forging habit.
Judge:
Well, if it's a forgery, it's not a very good one. The handwriting's terrible!
Apollo:
This is Mr. Wright's reproduction of what was written in the real letter.
Judge:
"Reproduction"...?
Apollo:
When Mr. Wright visited Kristoph Gavin's cell... ...he brought with him a small video camera.
Kristoph:
What...?
Apollo:
He recorded his entire conversation with you, Mr. Gavin. And the contents of your "personal" mail!
Kristoph:
...! R-Regardless. This mockery of a piece of evidence will never be accepted by the court. Evidence based on a "video" a man with no authority whatsoever "claims" he took... ...A man who happens to be an ex-attorney suspected of forgery!
Judge:
Hmm. Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
......
Apollo:
Prosecutor... Gavin?
Kristoph:
As embarrassing as this is for me to say... ...I'm afraid my brother is incapable of making rational judgments at the moment. Your Honor. ...Your decision, please.
Judge:
...... The defense's claim is denied.
Trucy:
What!?
Judge:
Only actual evidence is permitted in a court of law. Please remove the defense's "evidence" from the record.
Kristoph:
Better luck next time, Justice.
Apollo:
...!
Examine evidence
Letter From Misham
Stamp on Letter From Misham
Apollo:
This is... a commemorative stamp of Troupe Gramarye. But Mr. Wright wrote this letter himself. Based on the video, right? Did he go out of his way to find an identical stamp and put it on here? Seems like a bit of wasted effort if you ask me...
Front side
Trucy:
Hey, Apollo. It's not addressed to Kristoph!
Apollo:
Huh, you're right. ...I guess it makes sense. It would show a connection, if it was. And, for the killer, it's kind of the murder weapon. I doubt he'd give out his real name along with his address.
Trucy:
Oh, good point. How sneaky!
Apollo:
(Murder by mail... That's a scary thought.)
Judge:
Well, we've certainly taken a detour from our cross-examination... ...but, the defense appears to be lacking proof. I'm forced to end the cross-examination of Kristoph Gavin at this point.
Trucy:
...Apollo! Do something...!
Apollo:
I'm thinking! But... without evidence... ...I don't have anything I can use on him!
Judge:
...Very well. This ends the special witness's cross-examination.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...The show's over, yet the crowd screams for more. Only now do I understand why.
Judge:
Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
Frankly, I'm relieved. This has been bothering me for seven whole years. And I'm tired of the whole youthful angst scene. ...Now's our chance. Let's clean out the family closet, eh, Kristoph?
Kristoph:
Klavier... You're spinning out of control. Calm yourself before you say something you'll regret.
Klavier:
Spinning out of whose control? Mine? ...Or yours?
Kristoph:
Take a moment to consider everything you've built. Your reputation as a prosecutor... your fame with the masses. You could lose it all, Klavier.
Trucy:
Apollo! Did you see that? He's trying to press Prosecutor Gavin!
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin! Try to remember... ...what's really important to you!
Klavier:
You amuse me, Herr Forehead. I couldn't forget what's really important to me, even if I tried.
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
In fact, I haven't. Not even once. Seven years ago...
Klavier:
...Finally. You just couldn't resist, could you, Herr Wright?
Phoenix:
...Resist what? Presenting solid evidence?
Klavier:
Might I request we put the current cross-examination on hold? The prosecution would like to call a new witness.
Klavier:
...State your name and occupation for the record.
Apollo:
...I'm familiar with the trial. I've watched the video several times.
Klavier:
Didn't you find anything "unnatural" about it?
Judge:
Unnatural?
Apollo:
Well, you did seem unusually well prepared. I mean, Mr. Wright had only just presented his evidence. And the next moment you call in Drew Misham. It was almost as if...
Klavier:
"Almost as if"... what?
Apollo:
...... (Funny, it didn't even occur to me to wonder... ...But now that I do, I see there's only one possible explanation!) Almost as if... from the very beginning... ...you knew Mr. Wright was going to present that evidence.
Judge:
Ah...!
Klavier:
...Correct.
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
I knew that if I applied the usual pressure... ...Phoenix Wright would eventually come up with that forged diary page.
Kristoph:
Don't do this, Klavier.
Klavier:
I knew because you told me, Kristoph!
Apollo:
Wh... Whaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Klavier:
It was the night before the trial.
Kristoph:
...Klavier.
Klavier:
Kristoph...? Odd seeing you at the prosecutor's office the day before the trial.
Kristoph:
Ah... I won't be appearing in the trial, actually.
Klavier:
Huh? Why not...?
Kristoph:
I won't be facing off with you on your first trial, apparently. ...But in exchange, I brought information.
Klavier:
Information...?
Kristoph:
The attorney who'll be there in my place tomorrow is not to be trusted. Don't even give him the benefit of your respect. Listen... ...I want you to call in a special witness. Then... ......
Klavier:
...I wondered about it at the time. "How did Kristoph know so much?"
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin...
Klavier:
...Kristoph! We were supposed to face each other in that trial! A fair fight, brother to brother! I deserved that much! You let me borrow the victim's belongings... ...You showed me all your research on the case!
Trucy:
The victim's "belongings"...?
Apollo:
Which would have included Magnifi's diary... wouldn't it?
Kristoph:
......
Judge:
Mr. Gavin...?
Kristoph:
My, my, Klavier. You disappoint me. You find trees, yet miss the forest!
Apollo:
...You're the one missing the forest, Mr. Gavin.
Kristoph:
......
Klavier:
You can't sweep this under the rug. Not anymore. Tell me what was going on behind that trial!
Kristoph:
...... ...Why not? I've achieved what I came here to do. I see no harm in a little reminiscing.
Trucy:
Apollo...
Apollo:
...I think we're finally going to shine a light on the black belly of this thing, Trucy. We've done everything we could. I hope it's enough.
Kristoph:
...Seven years ago... the day before the trial. I visited the detention center at the request of my client, Zak Gramarye.
...Two cards.
...One card.
...Showdown time.
...Enough. You lose, Gavin. Thanks for the work. Now go.
Kristoph:
...To be honest, I don't know what his reasons were to this day. As far as I could tell... ...he dismissed me as his representation... because I lost in a game of poker. I can come to no other conclusion.
Trucy:
Daddy used to say something. "If you want to know a man, you have to compete"...
Apollo:
(...Zak wasn't watching his points, or the cards. He was watching the man behind the cards... Kristoph Gavin.)
Kristoph:
I couldn't believe it. Phoenix Wright...? A second rate attorney who relies on luck and bluffs! He dismissed me... and went with that pitiful excuse for a man? ...He deserved to die for that error alone.
Apollo:
Hold it! So, the one who requested that forgery was...?
Kristoph:
...Oh, I'm not admitting to anything. My point is... ...these two men shamed me, and I could not forgive that. Phoenix Wright and Zak Gramarye both deserved what they got.
Apollo:
...So you asked Mr. Misham to forge that evidence... ...so you could "win"! But then, when you were dismissed as Zak Gramarye's attorney... ...you used your forged evidence as a trap!
Klavier:
You fed me information about the forgery you made. ...Then you gave your dirty evidence to him!
Kristoph:
You're free to imagine what you will. My point... is that all I had imagined came to pass. Everything went perfectly.
...Hah...
Klavier:
...Ha ha ha... Incredible. If I wasn't laughing... I'd weep.
Judge:
Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
"Perfectly"...? You're mad, Kristoph. Stop fooling yourself.
Kristoph:
What are you talking about, Klavier?
Klavier:
...Tell me, how did that trial end?
Judge:
Cancelled... when the defendant vanished.
Klavier:
Ah. I get it. So, Kristoph... ...you've been living in fear for seven years!
Kristoph:
...What...?
Apollo:
You were afraid your forgery would be revealed, and your reputation trashed! You couldn't leave things to chance... ...so you watched everyone involved with the case, for seven years!
Brushel:
You know, he always felt like he was being watched? That's what he said. Every day, for seven years.
Brushel:
But I felt it, too! "Journalist Sure He Is Being Watched", end quote. Don't you wonder why Zak Gramarye got rubbed out after seven years... ...right after coming into contact with me!?
Judge:
W-Wait just a minute! Zak Gramarye was seen by this reporter? How is that possible!? Was he alive after being gone seven years!?
Apollo:
...... (Finally... I knew this moment was coming... I just didn't think we'd get here so fast. Zak Gramarye... gone missing for seven years... Trucy's father!)
Trucy:
What's wrong, Apollo! Go get him!
Apollo:
...Right. Leave it to me. Allow me to refresh the court's memory. Six months ago, Kristoph Gavin was charged with murdering a "mysterious traveler".
Judge:
I remember him quite well. Shadi Smith, was it? Poisoned in a Chinese restaurant... Tragic.
Apollo:
...The details don't really matter right now. What matters is... that traveler was Zak Gramarye!
Trucy:
...... What is it, Apollo?
Apollo:
...Huh?
Trucy:
Keep going! We'll talk about it later!
Apollo:
...! (Did... she already know?)
Judge:
Someone please explain this! ...Mr. Justice! Can you explain this?
Apollo:
It all started seven years ago... ...The great magician, Magnifi Gramarye's death started it. Magnifi Gramarye's death, and his student, Zak Gramarye, the suspect. Whoever defended Zak in court successfully would be famous beyond belief. ...Thinking that, Kristoph Gavin did the unthinkable. He forged evidence.
Judge:
...Drew Misham?
Apollo:
Actually, it was his daughter, Vera, who really did the work. You took precautions when you had that forgery made, didn't you, Mr. Gavin?
Judge:
Precautions...?
Klavier:
...To keep people from talking, of course.
(...These two know too much. Leave them alive and they'll be nothing but trouble...!)
Apollo:
That's when you planned your poisoning of the forgers.
Klavier:
Atroquinine... ...applied to a commemorative stamp.
Apollo:
But, luck was on Mr. Misham's side. The bomb didn't go off.
Judge:
His daughter...! She saved him by taking the stamp... I see!
Kristoph:
......
Apollo:
...But that wasn't the only bomb he set up.
Klavier:
The Ariadoney nail polish, ...of course!
Apollo:
You noticed something when you requested that forgery. When Vera Misham is nervous, she has a bad habit... ...a tendency to bite her nails.
Judge:
Ah...!
Apollo:
That nail polish... was her "good luck charm".
Drew:
She was almost kidnapped, once. Since then, she's been... Well, you can see for yourself. She refuses to leave the house.
Vera:
That person gave me... a good luck charm. For when I absolutely had to go outside. It protects me.
Drew:
Yes, apparently, she received something... a gift. She won't tell me what it was. It was from that client... the one who wanted that note made...
Apollo:
It was his insurance.
Judge:
Insurance?
Apollo:
As long as she lived quietly at home, there was no danger to her. But what if she had to go outside!?
Klavier:
If she ran into any trouble, she'd become nervous... ...and the nail polish would do the rest.
Apollo:
His time bombs sat there for seven years. And then... they went off almost simultaneously.
Kristoph:
If you're finished... ...may I return to my cell now? I'm not accustomed to standing for such long periods of time.
Apollo:
Mr. Gavin! Have you heard a single thing we've said!?
Kristoph:
Oh, I listened quite closely to your little tale. Quite an entertaining piece of fiction.
Apollo:
What...?
Kristoph:
...Klavier. Surely you understand.
Klavier:
...... We're back to the evidence. The lacking evidence. Nothing proves a link between him and the atroquinine that took Drew Misham's life.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
What about the restaurant? You killed Zak Gramarye! To keep him from talking!
Kristoph:
...I killed no man of that name. Read over the report again, if you like. The victim was a traveler by the name of Shadi Smith, about whom we know little else. You can't seriously think I knew he was that particular fugitive...?
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
OK, then why did you kill him!?
Kristoph:
...I plead my right to remain silent. Remember, this court did not convene to put me on trial. The defendant's name is "Vera Misham", suspected in the murder of her father. ...My trial's been finished for six months now.
Judge:
Hmm... I'm afraid we have strayed considerably from our purpose here. This court concurs with the witness. It is defendant Vera Misham who is on trial here.
Trucy:
No! But you were doing so good, Apollo!
Judge:
As long as there is no evidence to support the accusation against him... ...this course of inquiry cannot find Vera Misham innocent!
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor! Phoenix Wright spent seven years collecting this evidence...
Kristoph:
Objection!
Kristoph:
...You still don't get it, do you?
Apollo:
...!
Kristoph:
Let us assume there was poison in the nail polish. Who then, was responsible for causing Vera Misham to bite her nails?
Apollo:
Wh-What...?
Kristoph:
It wasn't me, I know that much. The one who brought that poison to her lips... was you.
Apollo:
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Kristoph:
...Evidence is everything. There is nothing more.
Judge:
...I believe this discussion has reached its conclusion.
Apollo:
Y-Your Honor!
Judge:
Mr. Justice... ...you have performed admirably well for a novice attorney. I respect your partner, Phoenix Wright's determination as well.
Kristoph:
However... ...without direct proof, you have nothing. Isn't that right, Klavier?
Klavier:
Unfortunately... yes, Kristoph. You're right. ...That is, you would've been right, until now.
Apollo:
...!
Kristoph:
...What?
Klavier:
...Did the news not reach your desk in solitary? The eyes of the nation are on this courtroom today. ...This is the trial case for a new judicial system.
Apollo:
...! That's right! (I'd totally forgotten!) The Jurist System!
Kristoph:
Jurists, you say...?
Judge:
The current judicial system has been deemed too "closed off" from society. This new system attempts to inject the wisdom of common citizens into the law.
Kristoph:
Common citizens? Wisdom? Is this some kind of a joke? What could we possibly gain by doing this? Entrusting our judicial system to a mindless, emotional mob of irrational mouth-breathers?
Judge:
Common citizens have something called "common sense". Common sense is not restricted by the law.
Kristoph:
Nonsense! There is only room for two in this court: Me, and the law! Keep the riff-raff out! Out, I say!
......
Apollo:
They're not in the court, actually. They're watching everything by video camera.
Kristoph:
H-How can you... allow this?
Apollo:
Incidentally, the one responsible for making this happen... ...was Phoenix Wright.
Kristoph:
Phoe... Phoenix Wright...? So... Everything was leading to this. Of course... Right... Wright.. Wright... WrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiGGGGGGGGGGGGgggggggGGGGGHhhhHHHHHHHHHHhhhhHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHHTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT I won't accept... I can't accept... This is no court! Law...! The law is everything! Law is absolute! You'd let ignorant swine soil your courts?
Klavier:
Kristoph... It's over.
Kristoph:
K-Klavier!!!
Klavier:
The law is "absolute"...? You can't be serious.
Kristoph:
Wh-What...?
Klavier:
Odd. I thought you spent your life looking for loopholes? The law isn't absolute. It's filled with contradictions.
Judge:
The law is the end product of many years of history... the fruit of human knowledge! Like a gem, polished to a gleam through trials... and errors. It is this fruit we receive, and pass on, and face in our time. And it is always changing, growing. Nurturing it is our task as human beings.
Klavier:
Except for you, Kristoph. You aren't changing. You've stopped. You're not needed anymore.
Apollo:
(...I couldn't think of anything to say. Maybe... because I still haven't seen enough. But someday, I'll know what law is. And I'll fight to change it if I have to!)
Judge:
...I see no need to further prolong this trial. This began as the trial of Vera Misham, accused of murdering her father... ...the painter, Drew Misham. However... ...several other incidents were reviewed, and we seem to have reached a conclusion. ...... Before this court declares a verdict, I await your decision. ...Jurists of the court. For the death of Drew Misham, how do you find the defendant, Vera Misham? Innocent...? Or guilty...? ...I turn to you now to consider this matter!
October 9, 12:48 PM
Jurists' Chambers
...This ends the trial for this case. Only the verdict remains to be decided. Defendant Vera Misham is currently in intensive care.
Phoenix:
If a decision cannot be reached today... ...it may never be reached. The factors involved are simple. Did the defendant poison her father that night...? If so, she is guilty. Or was there another reason for Mr. Misham's death? Did another person poison him? If so, she is innocent. A panel has been provided for each of you to input your decisions. That is all...
No. 6:
Please... Wait!
Phoenix:
...Yes, Jurist No. 6?
No. 6:
There's something in the Jurist's Handbook here: "Persons involved with the case may not be jurists."
Phoenix:
...That is correct. I've looked into all your dossiers. None of you were involved with the development of the case.
No. 6:
With the "development of the case"...? I see.
Phoenix:
...Does that answer your concern?
No. 6:
......
Phoenix:
...It's time for your verdicts. Make your decision in the case against Vera Misham! After seven years... the truth is ready to be heard. ...... Judge wisely. Judge well.
Not Guilty
Leads to:
"...And so a verdict was reached on October 9, 2:14 PM."
Guilty
...And so a verdict was reached on October 9, 2:14 PM. The first verdict under the Jurist System. ...A "hung jury". The final verdict would have to wait for the following day. But fate had different plans. That night, defendant Vera Misham's condition worsened. She died in her hospital bed. Her verdict was postponed... for eternity.
Game over
...And so a verdict was reached on October 9, 2:14 PM. The first verdict under the Jurist System. ..."Innocent", by unanimous decision. The record will show... ...that when the verdict was announced, special witness Kristoph Gavin... laughed. A laugh louder than any ever heard before... or since. A laugh that echoed in the halls of justice, lingering for what seemed like hours. October 10, 8:30 AM, the morning after the trial... In an intensive care ward... a true miracle occurred. Vera Misham opened her eyes.
October 10, 10:12 AM
Hickfield Clinic
Apollo:
Vera!!! I'm so glad, I...
Trucy:
Don't cry, Apollo! ...I'm happy, too. And proud. You did well, Apollo. When I thought about... what if Vera... I...
Apollo:
Hey now, don't you start crying, too! Um... sorry you had to see us like this.
Vera:
......
Apollo:
V-Vera...?
Vera:
...Thank you so much. Apollo, thank you.
Apollo:
No, I'm sorry... I shouldn't have pressed you like that... If... If I hadn't you never would have bitten your nails!
Vera:
No... I was wrong. Staying locked inside like that... clinging to my "good luck charm"...
Apollo:
Vera...
Vera:
...When I opened my eyes, and saw you... I finally understood. It's important to be a part of the world... ...to see things with your own eyes.
Apollo:
(It looks like that poison had some effect after all. It killed off whatever was holding Vera back from life.)
Trucy:
I knew you'd pull through, Vera! I mean, that's what Apollo was fighting for the whole time! Your future!
Vera:
I won't forget it. Here, let me thank you!
Apollo:
No, really, it's OK...
Trucy:
Oooh! Look! It's me! I love it! Thanks!
Apollo:
(Is that... me?)
Trucy:
She really captured your essence, Apollo! Well, I think so, at least.
Vera:
That reminds me... ...do you know where the other lawyer is...?
Apollo:
The other lawyer...?
Trucy:
Oh! You mean Daddy. 'Cept he's not a lawyer anymore.
Vera:
...It's my fault, isn't it? I'm sorry.
Trucy:
Oh! No, no, no, that's not what I meant...
Vera:
...No, it's OK. I'm through looking away from the things I've done. I hope I can look him in the eyes again someday and apologize.
Apollo:
...I'm sure he'd be happy to hear that.
Vera:
He... brought all those things for me... when he came to visit... earlier.
Apollo:
You mean that stack of videos? (...Mr. Wright finished watching them all?)
Trucy:
You know, I knew my real daddy was alive.
Apollo:
Huh...?
Trucy:
I was there, seven years ago, remember? I was the one who helped him "vanish" from the courtroom!
Apollo:
Y-You did wha... How?
Trucy:
I'm not telling! ...He promised me, that day he went away.
Zak:
We may not meet again for some time, Trucy... ...but know this, I will be watching. And, one day, I shall return. ...You're the next Gramarye, after all!
Apollo:
Oh... Trucy... (In the end... he couldn't keep that promise, could he?)
Trucy:
It's OK! Phoenix is my daddy now. Even if he can't really play the piano.
Apollo:
That he can't...
Trucy:
...Oh, and I've got you, too! Even if your voice is kinda loud sometimes.
Apollo:
Glad I made your list.
Trucy:
Hey! Come to think of it... ...where is Daddy? The one who can't play. Do you know, Apollo?
Apollo:
I think he said he had to meet someone.
Trucy:
Hmm. I wonder... ...Maybe it's a new mommy!
Apollo:
(*sigh*)
Vera:
Tee hee... Oh, Trucy?
Trucy:
Hmm? Yes, Vera?
Vera:
I was wondering... Could you show him to me once more? ...Sir Hat, was it?
Trucy:
Oh, he's not been knighted. ...Yet! Here goes... do us an impersonation, Mr. Hat!
Mr. Hat:
...Objection!!! ...Ahem.
Apollo:
Not loud enough. And I like Ms. Magic Underwear better, anyway.
Trucy:
That's "Magic Panties", Apollo!
Phoenix:
So... Your memory's returned.
???:
Mr. Wright... was this all a part of your plan, too?
Phoenix:
I don't know what you're talking about.
???:
When I lost my memory, I was reborn... as Lamiroir. But, you knew my true identity, did you not? ...That is why you chose me as one of your jurists.
Phoenix:
Ah, you're thinking into it too much. ...Besides. There was no guarantee that regaining your memory would make you happy.
???:
Of course it is a happy thing.
Phoenix:

???:
For so long, I thought I was alone... ...but now I know I have children. Two dear children. I'm so proud of them... This, too, I think, is thanks to you.
Phoenix:
Are you going to tell them?
???:
They do not know?
Phoenix:
Nope. They don't know their mother. They don't even know they're siblings.
???:
I will go to them... when the time is right. Until then, I...
Phoenix:
...Don't worry, I'll take care of them for you. They're... They're very important to me, too. ...A little annoying at times, but still. (I have to keep an eye on her, at least. Because I'm the only one who knows how she really feels... on the inside.) ...Your bracelet.
???:
Yes...?
Phoenix:
I've seen a lot of mysterious things these past seven years. ...But your bracelets were the strangest of all. I remember meeting him, half a year ago now, in Kristoph Gavin's office... ...and then I met you. Two fates destined to intertwine... and I was there when they crossed. I'll never forget that.
???:
...... Such a small thing, that bullet. Yet it tore who I was away... Ten years ago... During a simple rehearsal... It was a miracle no one died... but "I" didn't survive that accident. That is why I left the troupe... my family.
Phoenix:
......
???:
Now, my memory has returned. I am myself once more. For the first time... I am glad to be alive, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
...Speaking of miracles. Vera Misham regained consciousness this morning. I can only hope she's as glad as you are.
???:
It is... a strange thing, fate. Sometimes a life is taken. Sometimes a life is spared.
Phoenix:
You know what I've been thinking? People don't die that easily, really. ...As long as they've got something worth living for.
Apollo:
...And that's pretty much the end of my story. For now, anyway. I've still got a long way to go. And this power of mine... well, it needs some work. But... there's hope now. We'd lost it, but somehow, we found it again. That's why people are smiling again... Hope. Yeah, I think I'll keep at this lawyer thing for a while. Oops, training time. Gotta go. Chords of Steel... here comes Justice!
Apollo:
Objection!
Trucy:
I'm glad you're staying with the agency, Apollo! It's like.. like I've found my long-lost, big, little brother! Oh, and don't you worry about Troupe Gramarye! Trucy's on the case! ...Now that I've have this, thanks to Daddy.
Mr. Hat:
Trucy Gramarye? Frankly, I got my doubts. But Hat Gramarye? Now that'll pack 'em in!
Klavier:
It's not every day you get a trial that rocks harder than one of our gigs, ja? That's why it's over! The Gavinners are breaking up. ...The news caused a run on tissues at supermarkets nation-wide. You're the real stars, now! I look forward to our next jam session.
Phoenix:
Well, it's finally over. You know, thinking about it... ...I've been a piano player longer than I was a lawyer. Now that everything's sorted, and I've got time on my hands, maybe I'll take some lessons. ...Or maybe I'll take the bar exam... again.
Ema:
...So, I was standing around, eating Snackoos the other day... ...when I got this crazy idea! What if they were... golden!? You could augment the crunch, or better yet, make them ding! Ah... the power of science! ...Although the preservatives might not be 100% safe...
Olga:
In unlikely event you are wanting Russian feast, come to Borscht Bowl Club! The only thing colder than restaurant... is borscht! Dah, but if greater challenge is being required... ...then come to the Hydeout. You know who to ask for!
Plum:
So, Kitaki Pastries is getting back to its Eastern "roots". Spread the culture, and all. Yo, Boss! Culture time!!!
Big Wins:
...This is how we write "root", capice?
Plum:
But we're still about giving back to the people! Yo, Boss! P.R. time!!!
Big Wins:
...And this is how we write "people", alright?
Plum:
Not that Wocky's paying any attention. Whoooh... Kids...
Wocky:
Bizzoy! Chinese characters on cake was a fly idea like 3,000 years ago. Believe dat! Man, you wanna make it today, you gotta keep it real, you know what I'm saying? Yo, that's why I made the "O. G. Cracker". Fo real! I KNOW it don't look like no cracker, G. What, you want me to call it the O. G. Muffin!?
Eldoon:
...I don't know where all this talk about food is coming from. You ask me, there's only one food, and that's noodles. Noodles forever! I got a new one, too. See this time, I just put a big chunk of salt in the bowl! Why pretend? Eldoon's Noodles is about the salt! Salt forever!!!
Stickler:
My exceptionally inquisitive nature has won me unequivocal adoration in my department. You see, they used to call me Wesley Stinkler. And Wesley Stickyhands. But no longer. I have a new name, one that reflects my true academic nature... ...Wesley Sicko, reporting! Yes, curiosity is a sickness, and I am the cure!
Lamiroir:
I don't know how to thank you for all you've done. Light has returned to my life, and with it, joy. I may have lost years, but I have gained a treasure. ...Two treasures, in fact. I will think of them when I write my next song.
Brushel:
Brush-a Brush-a Brushel! Brush-a Brush-a Brushel! Brushel here, back on the beat with another interview! Eh? How do I feel about how things turned out? "No Scoop Yet But Journalist's Confidence In Mint Condition", end quoooooote!
Vera:
...I've decided to keep painting. Originals only, of course. ...I suppose I'll have to see a bit of the world outside to find what to paint. ...But, I know there are good people out there now. I've met them. ...The door is open. The world is waiting. Thank you.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Apollo:
...Um... You sure about that?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
(Ack! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Apollo:
They aren't, are they...?
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Justice, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Apollo:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Apollo:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
...You don't sound very sure, Mr. Justice. Objection overruled.
Apollo:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Perceive wrong area (during cross-examination segment "Poisoning Vera")
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Apollo:
Mr. Gavin! You're nervous about something!
Kristoph:
...There is that finger pointing at me so rudely.
Apollo:
...!
Kristoph:
...And that desperate gleam in your eyes. It's quite disturbing, actually. Perhaps because you have no faith in your own logic? ...Which is why you cling to your dubious "power".
Apollo:
(...Confident or not, I've come a long way, Mr. Gavin. Just a little more to go. ...I need a "word". There must be some word that sends shivers down his spine...)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Vera Misham...
Guilty
Judge:
The defendant will surrender herself to the court's care... ...to undergo a regular trial at the High Court within a month's time. Court is adjourned!
