Pearl:
Mystic Maya... M-Mystic Mayaaa... *sniffle, sniffle*
Phoenix:
There, there, Pearls...
Pearl:
I... I can't take it... anymore... ...Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
Phoenix:
L-Look! It'll be alright! Everything may still work out.
Pearl:
Hm...?
Phoenix:
The condition was that we had to get a "not guilty" verdict. And so far, the kidnapper has kept his word and hasn't hurt Maya. And he won't because Mr. Engarde hasn't been given a "guilty" sentence yet!
Pearl:
Unngg... Nnmff... *sniffle, sniffle*
Phoenix:
Cheer up! We don't have time to stand around crying! We have to get going!
Pearl:
... Y-You're right...
Pearl:
Mystic Maya is in much more pain than I am!
Phoenix:
Yes, that's right. So...
???:
Hey! You guys! Glad I caught you, pal!
Pearl:
M-Mr. Scruffy Detective...
Phoenix:
(...Oh boy. Looks like Detective Gumshoe... has been dubbed "Mr. Scruffy Detective" in Pearls' book now...)
Gumshoe:
It's just plain ol' "Mr. Dick Gumshoe" now, and I came to talk to you, pal!
Phoenix:
(But we're kind of busy right now...)
Examine
Plant
Gumshoe:
Hey, it's wilting a little!
Pearl:
I'll... I'll give it some delicious water, pal!
Phoenix:
Ah, it's OK... I already did that...
Gumshoe:
...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?
Phoenix:
(Did he just call the watering can, "Mr."?)
Poster
Pearl:
This is the... uh... Nickel Samurai, right?
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, that's right.
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her "Nickel Samurai", alright!?
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.
Pearl:
Oh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...
Gumshoe:
B-But I can read AND I'm tall, pal!
Phoenix:
P-Please stop competing with an 8 year old... It's disturbing...
Desk
Phoenix:
My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...
Pearl:
Oh! I cleaned it up even more for you last night!
Gumshoe:
B-But I can get it even more cleaner, pal!
Pearl:
Aaah! That's... That's for the toilet!!
Phoenix:
(What a mess. Literally...)
Talk
The future
Phoenix:
So, what are you going to do from now on?
Gumshoe:
Whadaya mean, pal?
Phoenix:
Well, you've been fired, right? So, do you have a new job lined up yet?
Gumshoe:
Oh, that! A-Ah... What am I supposed to do now, pal!? I... I don't have anything coming in at all until my next payday!
Phoenix:
Wh-What are you talking about!? You don't have another payday!
Gumshoe:
... I guess that means I'm just gonna half [sic] to work here at your place, pal!
Phoenix:
S-SAY WHAT!?
Gumshoe:
You'll be searching for things that will prove Mr. Engarde's innocence all day, right?
Phoenix:
W-Well... yeah...
Gumshoe:
So yeah! I'm going to help you, pal! I've got lots of experience in investigating, and watching over people's places! And I'm great at making really simple meals, pal! I'll take care of it all!
Pearl:
Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's let Mr. Scruffy Detective take care of things!
Phoenix:
A-Ah... OK... By the way, what's your best dish?
Gumshoe:
Instant noodles, pal.
Phoenix:
(Why am I surrounded by people who only eat cheap, unhealthy foods...?)
Edgeworth
Gumshoe:
...That was the first time I've ever seen Mr. Edgeworth act like that... Never thought he'd say something like, he didn't care if Ms. Andrews killed herself...
Pearl:
H-He said that!? That's horrible...
Gumshoe:
But because of him doing that, we got the truth finally.
Phoenix:
...The truth... (Ms. Andrews' last testimony; I wonder if that was the truth...?) I'll give you that there was nothing strange in her testimony itself. But... I still think there is something fundamentally wrong with the whole thing.
Gumshoe:
You mean about "that" thing, pal?
Phoenix:
Why would she want to -- no, I mean, almost "need" to frame Mr. Engarde... I couldn't figure that out from anything she said all day!
Gumshoe:
... Then... Then you're saying that testimony... was a lie...?
Phoenix:
Not a lie, per se... It just feels like there's more here than meets the eye. Or that's what Edgeworth would like us to believe...
Pearl:
Th-That's such a dirty trick! Even that woman prosecutor was better than that!
Phoenix:
(Franziska von Karma...) Speaking of Ms. von Karma, do you have any more information on her condition? Wasn't she shot this morning!?
Franziska (appears after Edgeworth)
Gumshoe:
Ms. von Karma was shot today on the way to the trial by a pistol, pal.
Phoenix:
B-But she's going to be fine, right? I mean, Edgeworth said she was in "stable condition", but...
Gumshoe:
Well, she was shot in the shoulder, so she's OK and still hanging in there. They should be done taking the bullet out, so she's probably resting at the hospital.
Phoenix:
Which one...?
Gumshoe:
What? Are you going to visit her, pal?
Phoenix:
N-No... Well, I was kind of thinking about it...
Gumshoe:
Hey! You've actually got a heart, don't you!? She looked like she was being tortured to death not being able to go to the trial today, so maybe it'd be good for her if you went and let her whip you for a bit, pal!
Pearl:
Let's go let her whip us, Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
Now I'm DEFINITELY not going.
Gumshoe:
Um... let's see... The name of the hospital... Oh yeah! The "Hotti Clinic"!
Phoenix:
(That name sends a chill down my spine... Well, I guess it can't hurt to stop by and say hi...)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Look, it's my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
Oh! It's a little tarnished, don't you think, pal? Don't worry! I'll make it all sparkly shiny again!
Phoenix:
(I... I'm really touched...)
Radio Transceiver
Gumshoe:
Have you heard anything from the kidnapper...?
Phoenix:
...No... not yet.
Gumshoe:
I'm sure once he hears what happened at the trial today, he'll call, pal. But remember! You can't provoke him when you get to talk to him!
Jammin' Ninja's Button
Gumshoe:
When I saw that button, I thought to myself, "This is gonna prove Mr. Engarde's guilty!"... But it looks like there was a lot more to it than I thought, huh pal?
Phoenix:
You're a pro. You should know better than to say something like that.
Gumshoe:
W-Well, I'm not a cop anymore. Just a regular helper around the office now, so...
Phoenix:
(I wonder if he misses working down at the precinct...?)
Knife
Gumshoe:
Who would've thought that this knife Mr. Engarde used to eat his dinner steak with...
Phoenix:
Go on...
Gumshoe:
...That it would be stabbed into the victim's body by Ms. Andrews, of all people. I guess she just hated the victim that much, huh pal?
Phoenix:
The question isn't why she hated the victim to that extend, but rather why she tried to pin the murder on Mr. Engarde.
Pearl:
I wonder if she really hates Mr. Engarde?
Lotta's Photo
Gumshoe:
So this "Nickel Samurai" was really Ms. Andrews, huh?
Phoenix:
Yeah. This is either when she went to Mr. Engarde's room to get the knife... ...or when she was done with the foul deed. But I guess we'll never know.
Maya Fey profile
Gumshoe:
It'll be OK! You'll see her again, little missy!
Pearl:
Y-Yeah!
Gumshoe:
It's really important that you don't give up!
Pearl:
O-OK!
Phoenix:
(I guess a big voice really does give you a sense of presence...)
Pearl:
I... I won't give up. Ever!
Pearl Fey profile
Gumshoe:
Cheer up! You can't give in, missy!
Pearl:
Y-Yeah!
Gumshoe:
Hey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol... ... I... I don't have my pistol or my police badge anymore...
Pearl:
Cheer up! You can't give in!
Gumshoe:
Y-Yeah!
Phoenix:
(What are those two doing...?)
Dick Gumshoe profile
Gumshoe:
People are jealous of my roguishly cool "detective look", pal. It's because of this look that I passed the detective's test, you know.
Phoenix:
Oh.
Gumshoe:
But you know, people can't coast through life on their looks alone, pal.
Phoenix:
Yeah, you can't count on your looks alone.
Pearl:
Wow... I learned something new today...
Franziska von Karma profile
Phoenix:
Is she alright...? After being shot, I mean...
Gumshoe:
Her wound isn't that bad... Well, the gunshot wound anyway... But the wound to her pride, now that's a different story, pal.
Phoenix:
The wound to her pride?
Gumshoe:
Well, until now, she's always upheld the "Von Karma Creed", but since she came here, well, you've given her pride quite a beating, pal.
Phoenix:
Oh...
Gumshoe:
I mean, she may act all grown-up, but she's really still just an 18 year old. ...Quite frankly, I worry about her, pal.
Miles Edgeworth profile
Gumshoe:
That's the first time I've seen that side of Mr. Edgeworth, pal. Forcing people to say what he wants them to during testimony... I want to know what in the world happened to him all this time he's been gone...
Matt Engarde profile
Gumshoe:
I can't believe it. Maya getting kidnapped all because of this guy... I mean, what kind of person is the real murderer anyway!?
Pearl:
Maybe they're a big fan of Mr. Engarde?
Phoenix:
(But the kidnapper's voice... He sounded like an old man to me...)
Adrian Andrews profile
Gumshoe:
My impression of her has totally changed, pal.
Phoenix:
Um... So, where is she right now...?
Gumshoe:
I'm sure she's being questioned down at the precinct. At the very least about messing with the body, and obstructing the investigation. And she'll probably be staying over at the detention center...
Phoenix:
(The detention center, huh...)
Celeste Inpax profile
Gumshoe:
She was Ms. Adrian Andrews' mentor.
Phoenix:
(Because of the suicide of the mentor she depended on, Adrian Andrews tried to follow her in an attempted suicide... Now the question is, who is Ms. Andrews relying on now...?)
Anything else
Phoenix:
Could you please take a look at this...?
Gumshoe:
Um... I can't think of anything to say about this, pal. ... Wh-Why don't I make us some instant noodles, instead?
Phoenix:
Th-That's OK... Really.

Phoenix:
(From what the guard told me... It sounds like along with Mr. Engarde, Ms. Andrews is also being detained here.)
Pearl:
Then we should talk with them since we're here...
Phoenix:
Yeah, but both of them are still in questioning.
Pearl:
Hmm... And we don't have time to waste.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, visiting hours are almost over...)
Examine
Surveillance camera
Phoenix:
Smile, you're on candid camera.
Guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitor's the visitor's room. Catching a few z's while he's standing; now that's a good way to spend free time.
March 22Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby
Pearl:
Alright now, Mr. Nick! Let's go look for clues! We have to, for Mystic Maya's sake...
???:
You shall not pass!
Phoenix:
*gasp* Ms. Oldbag!
Oldbag:
Don't devalue my name and turn it into a gasp, you spiky-headed poof! Because of you, I've been made to look like the bad guy again! Although, I did get a piece of gum from Edgey-boy, just as he promised... But what I really wanted was something much more valuable! I wanted Edgey-poo's heart! I want it all for me! It's all your fault! You've awakened the wild beast inside of this Oldbag! Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
Pearl:
Aah! Ms. Oldbag!
Oldbag:
Keep your hands off of me! This helmet is airtight! No air's gets in and no air gets out!
Phoenix:
Umm... What does your helmet have to do with anything?
Oldbag:
Hmph! Don't think you can get me to move with silly questions! You're going to have to defeat me if you want to get by!
Phoenix:
(I'm not hearing this...)
Examine
Anywhere
Oldbag:
Hey! I said no restless loitering and no touching! You're interfering with my watch, and that's a no-no!
Phoenix:
(Argh. Looks like in order to search around here... I have to first get this kooky "alien" to go away...)
Talk
Any options
Phoenix:
Um...
Ray Gun:
*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*
Oldbag:
Hah! You're a million light-years too early to be asking ME questions, whippersnapper!
Phoenix:
(Argh. Looks like the only way I'm going to get any investigating done... is to first do something about this kooky "alien"...)
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
Umm... Could you please take a look at this...?
Oldbag:
Hmph! Sorry, sonny. I can't see it very well through this helmet!
Phoenix:
(Argh. Looks like the only way I'm going to get any investigating done... is to first do something about this kooky "alien"...)
Oldbag:
I see that look in your eyes! You stop thinking I'm an alien from outer space this instant!
March 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.
Pearl:
Wow. Everybody looks really busy with something or another...
Phoenix:
Hmm... They're probably strengthening the evidence for tomorrow's trial.
Detective:
Hey! Hurry up with that, will ya!? Pass that victim's list around! ...Now you're speaking nonsense! There's more than 100 people on there!
Pearl:
Um, Mr. Nick...? Is Mr. Engarde a really bad, terrible criminal...?
Phoenix:
... Actually, Pearls, never mind. It sounds like they're working on a different case...
Examine
Detective on left
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Detective:
"...Very well. Now why do you want to work for our company?" "Well, that would have to be because I feel I would like to help this company grow."
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for corporate interviews.
Chief Detective
Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
WHAT!? Prosecutor von Karma was shot in front of the courthouse!? Wh-Who did it!? Who shot her!?
Phoenix:
(I have a sneaking suspicion that even Gumshoe could do this guy's job...)
March 22Hotti ClinicReception
Phoenix:
(...Never thought I'd ever come back to this place...)
???:
Hmm, yes... Are you here to visit a patient? Hmm...
Phoenix:
Ah, hi... ...Wait a second! You're...!
???:
Hmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh.
Phoenix:
Why are you still here!?
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... What is it? Hmm... Can I help you? You can tell me... Hmm, yes...
???:
Director Hotti!
Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth...
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. ...Oh, you're the man from this morning. Hmm, yes... What is it?... Uh huh...
Edgeworth:
Director. Franziska... How is Franziska von Karma?
Hotti:
Hmm... You don't need to worry. Hmm, yes... She's in good hands... Because, you see... I'm personally taking good care of her... Hmm, yes... Hee hee. Hmm, yes... and that thing... that surgery... It went well.
Edgeworth:
...You have my gratitude.
Phoenix:
(It looks like Edgeworth doesn't know about this "Director" and his secret...)
Hotti:
She looked so pitiful; absolutely terrified. Hmm, yes... But I understand, hmm... Hmm, yes... Her opponent was a gun, after all. Uh huh. And when I snuck up on her real secret-like, she would scream really loud. Hmm, yes.
Edgeworth:
I see.
Hotti:
Ah, but she's really cute too. When I'd do that, she'd whip me with her whip, uh huh... Boy did I cry like a baby. Hmm, yes... But I think I could get used to it. Hmm... Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
von Karma:
Go back to your room.
Hotti:
You're so mean, uh huh... So mean... my frisky Friska. But that's good too-- Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! OK, OK... I... Hmm, yes... It's time for my IV drops. Hmm, yes...
von Karma:
... And what are those tulips doing in your hand, Mr. Phoenix Wright?
Phoenix:
(Argh! I knew I shouldn't have come here!)
Examine
Waiting room on left
Phoenix:
This must be the waiting area. It's got the feeling of one and there are sofas lined up... but I don't see all that many patients.
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... well, visiting hours are over. That's why... Hmm... It's time for nightly consultations to begin... Mine, that is... Heh heh heh.
Phoenix:
(...Isn't there anyone keeping an eye on this guy...?)
Door at the back
Phoenix:
(I wonder where that door way down there leads to...?)
Hotti:
Oh, that's the X-ray room. Hmm, yes...
Phoenix:
H-H-How did you know what I was thinking!?
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... Well, it's... Because that's the X-ray room... Uh huh, yes...
Phoenix:
(There is something very peculiar about this guy... Because I know it's not me...)
Limping patient
Phoenix:
This patient is undergoing rehabilitation.
Hotti:
Wasn't that patient standing in the same spot the last time you came to visit? Doesn't look like they've moved any closer to the reception desk, huh? Is this clinic really doing anything!? Is that patient really getting better!? Hmm...
Phoenix:
Hey! Don't just cut into my monologue like that! I'm explaining things here!
Hotti:
Ah, sorry. Hmm, yes... Most sorry... Yes... Uh, huh...
Reception area
Phoenix:
This is the clinic's reception desk, but it doesn't look like there's anyone at the counter. On the wall is this month's "Word to the Wise": "Put your best foot forward." Putting this up at a general clinic like this is doesn't really mean much, does it...?
Talk
The shooting
von Karma:
I was shot in front of the courthouse, in my right shoulder. Hmph... It's no big deal. This sort of thing happens all the time. I even had full intentions of running the trial this morning.
Pearl:
But! But that would've been too much!
Phoenix:
(Yeah! You looked like you were deathly scared until only a few minutes ago...)
von Karma:
But I was dragged here by THAT prosecutor. He even went so far as to grab me by the wrist the whole way here.
Edgeworth:
It was the only logical course of action given the bullet was still lodged in your shoulder. But with me doing so... I found myself having to clean up after you and that irresponsible deal you made.
von Karma:
...!
Phoenix:
(I think I know what "deal" he's referring to...)
The deal
Phoenix:
Ms. von Karma. You made a deal with Ms. Andrews yesterday, didn't you?
von Karma:
I don't know what you mean.
Phoenix:
In order to make sure you got your guilty verdict on Mr. Engarde, you told Ms. Andrews to not testify in court today.
von Karma:
Hmph, I don't know what you're talking about. Do you have proof that I made such a deal?
Phoenix:
Y-You're denying it!?
von Karma:
... It looks like you were lucky, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
von Karma:
If I had been in court today, this trial would already be over.
Phoenix:
All while hiding Ms. Andrews' own crime?
von Karma:
That isn't my problem. Whether she had tampered with evidence or not... I have only one objective. To find Engarde guilty of murder. The end justifies the means, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The end justifies the means.
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
Aah!
von Karma:
...
Phoenix:
(I guess that's all I get...)
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Phoenix:
...Ms. von Karma. Adrian Andrews believed you when you said, "If you don't tell the truth of what really happened, then Engarde will be found guilty."
von Karma:
And what does that have to do with me?
Phoenix:
Because of that, she is now in danger of being found guilty herself! All because she believed in your words until the very end...
von Karma:
... That still has nothing to do with me. She's just a weak person, that's all.
Phoenix:
But you had to know she was... OWWW!
von Karma:
... I think visiting hours here are about over. So, if you'll excuse me.
Pearl:
What's wrong? Why did she suddenly cut you off...?
Phoenix:
(Probably because she thinks I had the advantage in that argument... ...Edgeworth...)
Talk
Today's trial
Phoenix:
What happened today at the trial, Edgeworth? That was not like you at all...
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
I mean, I know you knew about Ms. Andrews' condition. You could have made her testify as many times as you wanted, but to go that far...!
Edgeworth:
...Ah, but she wouldn't testify about THAT until I said something. Listen, Wright. The courtroom is a garden of judgment. I am putting myself on the line when I stand in there. And that's why I made the witness do the same... It's only natural.
Adrian's card
Phoenix:
By the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today... That's rare for you.
Edgeworth:
Witness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry! Do you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time!
Phoenix:
That card... What in the world is it?
Edgeworth:
... You mean this...? ... Listen, Wright. This is top secret information. You absolutely cannot leak this. A special investigation team has existed for a number of years, but few know of it.
Phoenix:
I-I understand.
Edgeworth:
Their task is to find the "owner" of this card... A man called Shelly de Killer. And just as his name states, he is a "killer", an assassin. The best, at that.
Phoenix:
(An assassin!?)
Picture Card added to the Court Record.
Assassin (appears after Adrian's card)
Phoenix:
So who is this "Shelly de Killer"?
Edgeworth:
"De Killer" is the name of a long standing line of assassins.
Pearl:
Long standing?
Edgeworth:
The name first appeared about 100 years ago, I hear. Shelly is the professional name of the third heir to the De Killer name.
Phoenix:
So because his professional name is "Shelly", he leaves cards with a shell on them...?
Edgeworth:
He has a habit of making sure to leave a card by the body of his victims.
Pearl:
Why would he do something like that...?
Edgeworth:
We think it is a part of his duty to his clients.
Phoenix:
His "duty"?
Edgeworth:
If he leaves a card, then his clients can be assured it was he who killed the victim. It also serves as insurance against any charges being pushed onto his clients.
Phoenix:
...I see...
Edgeworth:
De Killer values the trust between his clients and himself above all else. It seems that this is one honorable assassin with a moral conscience.
Phoenix:
(I guess that even honorable assassins can exist...) So, you think this assassin... You think he's the one who did the killing in this case?
Edgeworth:
It would appear that way. The discovery of the card basically confirms it, wouldn't you agree?
Phoenix:
(Shelly de Killer, huh...)
Maya's situation (appears after Assassin)
Leads to:
"I noticed something at the trial today."
Present
Anything
Edgeworth:
...I've been put in charge of this case. So I can't give you any help with reagards to clues or evidence.
Phoenix:
You sure are hardnosed. Totally different from Detective Gumshoe.
Edgeworth:
...And that is why he was fired.
Phoenix:
(He's got a point...)
Edgeworth:
I noticed something at the trial today. You were behaving in a very strange manner. ...Is something the matter?
Phoenix:
(I guess... I should just tell him.) Maya... She's been kidnapped.
Edgeworth:
K-Kidnapped? What does the kidnapper want!?
Phoenix:
An acquittal.
Edgeworth:
... I see. I had no idea. ... I will prepare a rescue team as soon as possible, and resolve this by tomorrow.
Pearl:
R-Really!? Did you hear that, Mr. Nick!? M-Mr. Edgeworth is going to...
Phoenix:
Stop trying to console me, Edgeworth! I don't need your pity!
Pearl:
Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
There's no way you can find her. We don't have even a single clue to go on.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
There's only one way to save her. I... I have to get an acquittal somehow! It's the only way!
Edgeworth:
... Wright. Listen, you need to know something. Juan Corrida was killed by Shelly de Killer. And the client who ordered the job... is Matt Engarde... Your own client.
Phoenix:
Please, stop! ...I can't listen to you. I can't believe that.
Edgeworth:
...I see. Well, if you want to continue your investigation, you will need this.
Pearl:
What is it?
Edgeworth:
The hotel right now is restricted to police personnel only, as we are looking for any clues that might lead us to Shelly de Killer. If you take this with you to the hotel, I'm sure they will let you enter.
Letter of Introduction added to the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
...In any case, I must attend to the preparations for Maya's rescue team. We'll meet again, if anything should happen. Now if you'll excuse me...
Pearl:
Mr. Nick? Do you... Do you think... Mr. Engarde hired an assassin...?
Phoenix:
No way! (I mean, he doesn't have a Psyche-Lock...)
Pearl:
Y-Yeah, I guess not...
Phoenix:
Maya... Please... All I ask is you make it home, safe and sound!
Date:&#160;??? Time&#160;???Location:&#160;???
Maya:
Heh heh. I guess even kidnappers can be a little clumsy. Clumsy enough to drop a card like this for me. And even though he said he was an "assassin", I bet he's just making that up, like how Nick does with everything in court. Anyway, let's try out the card trick with this card I just found...
...*click*...
Maya:
Sounds like I got the door open... OK! Time to go take a look around!
Examine
Door
Maya:
I've unlocked the door with this card... I should probably go and take a look around...
Date:&#160;??? Time&#160;???Location:&#160;???
Maya:
Wh-What is this place...? I've got a feeling I'm not in the hotel anymore... Are those videos over there? ...Well, I'll worry about that later. For now, I should be looking for clues. That way, I can show them to sis and maybe get out of here!
Examine
TV
Maya:
Wow, I've never seen a TV this big before. Now where's the power button... Hmm...
...*click*...
Maya:
... Phooey. It's busted. I would so die a happy Samurai fan... if I ever got to see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this. ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about dying, all things considered...
Antenna
Maya:
What is this thing? An antenna... I guess? And this is... a VCR? There sure are a lot of electronic gadgets here. But what is an antenna doing here...?
Computer
Maya:
Oh, hey. It's a computer. I've never really used one before. ... Um... I have no idea where the power switch on this thing is... Drat. There goes my plan to use this somehow to get out of here.
Table
Maya:
There's a framed picture sitting on this coffee table. It's a picture of a woman... She's kind of pretty. Hey, looks like something's written here... Let's see... I think it says, "With love... Celeste" I bet this could be a clue...
Sofa
Maya:
...That's weird. What's a figurine doing on a sofa in a place like this...? I think it's... a bear. Aww, how cute! But it's got a lot of cuts and slits on it... I wonder if it's some kind of puzzle or something...
Video tapes
Maya:
It's so dark in here that I can barely see, but... these kinda feel like... video tapes... All of them... Just what kind of room is this...?
Door
Maya:
Unngh... Locked. Of course. And it doesn't look like I can use the card to open this door. There's a little hole at the bottom of the door. If only I was a little skinnier. Then maybe I'd be able to crawl through there...
Anywhere else
Maya:
I can't see very well in this darkness, but it doesn't seem like there's anything there...
(Examining antenna, table, sofa, and door leads to:)
???:
Oh, this simply will not do... I cannot have you wandering around at will.
Maya:
Eeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
???:
...It seems... that your Mr. Wright is truly concerned about you.
Maya:
He is...?
???:
For now, I would suggest you remain cooperative. If you cannot, there are ways in which I can help you...
Maya:
Ways... You mean...
???:
"Dead men tell no tales" is how the saying goes, correct?
Maya:
"D-D-D-D-Dead"!?
???:
I'm almost certain I told you on our first meeting. I am... an assassin.
Maya:
N-No way... You're lying... I mean... An assassin...?
???:
...People are not always who they appear to be.
Maya:
Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick!

Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Hm? O-Oh yes, Pearls? (Got caught up in my thoughts about Maya's situation...)
Pearl:
Mr. Edgeworth has left, you know.
Phoenix:
(I guess for now, I have no choice but to believe in Mr. Engarde. But I think I should listen to his story one more time...)
Phoenix:
Alright! Let's get going too.

I'm sorry, but visiting hours are over for today.

Phoenix:
(Argh... I have too many questions I need to ask...) I-I'm sorry, but I'm Phoenix Wright, a lawyer for one of the...
Jailer:
You're Mr. Wright, you say? Oh, yeah, there's a message here for you.
Phoenix:
A message...?
Jailer:
It's from Matt Engarde. ...Ah, here you are.
Pearl:
What did he write!? Is it something really important...?
Phoenix:
I don't know. Well, let's see what it has to say... "To the lawyer dude. I've got something really important to tell you." (Why do I feel uneasy all of a sudden...?)
Engarde:
... ... Oh, Mr. Wright. So actually... I have a favor to ask of you. I have this cat named Shoe. I didn't put out a lot of food when I left the house, so he's probably pretty hungry. You think you could drop by my house and feed Shoe for me, dude? My house is just a little ways down from the hotel, alright?
Phoenix:
...
Pearl:
Th-This is terrible! Let's hurry! We have to feed his cat! I'm sure poor Shoe's stomach is growling by now!
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, I guess...
Matt's Note jammed into a pocket.

Oldbag:
What!? You want me to look at this worthless piece of... .................. ...Edgey-pooooo...
Phoenix:
(Ugh... Is that her perfume, Phéromone d'Amour, I smell...? *shudder*)
Oldbag:
Let's see here... "Would you please allow this unsophisticated young person to conduct his investigation? Yours truly, Miles Edgeworth"
Phoenix:
"Y-Yours truly"!?
Oldbag:
Hmph, that man's good at flattery. Fine. But only because Edgey-poo said so, you understand!?
Letter of Introduction given to Ms. Oldbag.
Oldbag:
I just thought of something I have to do. Remember, no messing around! You do anything bad and I won't let you off the hook!
Pearl:
It looks like she has strong feelings for Mr. Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
That may be, but you know nothing's going to come of it.
Pearl:
That's so mean, Mr. Nick! Feelings are meant to be told and shared!
Phoenix:
Owww... (Every time we talk about love, I always end up with a handprint on my face somehow.) Um, so anyway, let's continue our investigation.
Pearl:
OK!
Ray Gun:
*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*
Phoenix:
Ack! What!? What now!?
Oldbag:
One little thing, before I forget. You can't go into Engarde's room today.
Pearl:
Why?
Oldbag:
The police's main investigation team is going to be in there all day, you hear?
Phoenix:
(I wonder if they're the team in charge of investigating "De Killer"...?)
Oldbag:
So don't go in there! Set one foot in there and you'll face the wrath of Wendy Oldbag!
Examine
Stage
Phoenix:
It's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...
Pearl:
But that press conference...
Phoenix:
It was really the victim, Juan Corrida, trying to disclose something about Mr. Engarde.
Pearl:
But they're both heroes... Why would they do something so un-heroic?
Phoenix:
They may look like heroes on the outside, but on the inside, they're only human.

Oh! There's a giant cooking hearth here.
Phoenix:
That's actually a fireplace.
Pearl:
How are they different, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:

Pearl:
You should come and visit Fey Manor, then. I'll show you one when you do.
Motorcycle
Pearl:
A... A giant bicycle is flying through the air!
Phoenix:
... That bicycle, Pearls, is one where you don't have to pedal, and it moves on its own.
Pearl:
Really!? Wow!
Phoenix:
But sorry to disappoint you, it can't fly.
Pearl:
...Oh. That's too bad.
Lounge set
Phoenix:
It's a very comfortable and spacious lounge set. I wonder if famous stars drop by and sit around and have a good time. ...In any case, I don't really belong here, do I? ... Argh. What is with me and feeling inferior today...?
Pearl:
?
Masks
Pearl:
Ah! There are masks here!
Phoenix:
Yeah. That one in the middle is the Steel Samurai. The ones next to that are the Pink Princess and the Evil Magistrate. They fought many battles against the backdrop of Neo Olde Tokyo.
Pearl:
Wow, you really know a lot about the Steel Samurai, Mr. Nick.
Phoenix:

Door on behind

There's another door over there.
Pearl:
You shouldn't go wandering off over there, Mr. Nick.
Phoenix:
...Yes, Pearls. (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her to stop playing around...)
Door
Pearl:
There's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick.
Phoenix:
I bet it's for Mr. Engarde's cat to use.
Pearl:
Oh, you mean Shoe.
Phoenix:
(The door... It's locked tight. Well, I guess that's to keep nosey people like me from entering it.)
Talk
Matt Engarde
Phoenix:
You must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right?
Doe:
Honestly, sir... I don't believe my master is capable of such a foul deed as murder.
Phoenix:
...
Doe:
...
Phoenix:
And, uh, anything else?
Doe:
No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master or his affairs.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... How typically "butler-like", as it were...)
John Doe
Phoenix:
Mr. Doe, how long have you served at this residence...?
Doe:
Well, sir, I would have to say... maybe about one year?
Phoenix:
...
Doe:
...
Phoenix:
And, uh, anything else?
Doe:
No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of himself and his affairs.
Phoenix:
(You know, I would've thought Mr. Engarde the kind to have a "maid" over a butler...)
Shoe
Phoenix:
That's a very cute cat you've got here.
Doe:
It is my duty to take care of him. The master rather fancies Shoe.
Phoenix:
...
Doe:

Phoenix:
And, uh, anything else?
Doe:
No, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the family cat.

Any other evidence
Phoenix:
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking a look at this.
Doe:
I'm afraid I cannot offer up anything special about it. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of evidence for a trial.
Phoenix:
(Polite yet snotty with a touch of rude. He's the stereotypical butler alright.)
Any other profiles
Phoenix:
Would you happen to know who this person is...?
Doe:
No, I would not. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master's acquaintances.
Phoenix:
(Then what in the world CAN I talk to you about!?)
Pearl:
M-Mr. Nick! Being angry is bad!
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Doe:
...Well, I'm afraid I must take my leave of you now.
Phoenix:
Oh, we should probably get going ourselves.
Doe:
Ah, so young and yet already so accomplished. A master of law...
Phoenix:
But there is also a lot to be proud of in being a butler, in charge of the house and all.

Thank you for the compliment, sir. ...People are not always who they appear to be. ...Now if you'll excuse me.

Hey, City Boy!

L-Lotta... You're still here...
Lotta:
Reckon course! An investigative photographer eats or starves on her ability to snap up the scoop, yeah!? And this hotel just has that "aura of mystery". Ya know, like something's always about to happen.
Pearl:
But... Do you have a camera?
Lotta:
Reckgiven!
Lotta:
A photographer's gotta have cameras out the ear like corn to be a real pro, ya know!? So I'm hangin' around here... ... ... Speaking of cameras and feedin' the mouth, do ya have mine, ya bread-thief!?
Phoenix:
(Why can't you drop that "thief" thing already?)
Examine
Teddy bear
Pearl:
Aww, how lovely! The teddy bear looks happy to be surrounded by so many beautiful flowers.
Phoenix:
(Pearls really seems to like teddy bears a lot.)
Phoenix:
Ah... I wonder if... Lotta also...
Lotta:
I didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!
Phoenix:
(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)
Flowers on left
Phoenix:
Compared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Although, other than sunflowers and tulips, I have no idea what any of them are.
Pearl:
Um, Mr. Nick? What's this flower called?
Phoenix:
It's a sunflower... I think.
Pearl:
This flower over here is pretty too.
Phoenix:
That's a tulip, I guess.
Pearl:
...
Lotta:
Callin' everythin' a sunflower or a tulip; don't reckon even little kids'll fall for that!
Door on right
Phoenix:
There's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, "Matt Engarde's Room".
Pearl:
The old lady told us about this, didn't she? That we can't go in this room tonight.

(I wonder if an investigation briefing is going on right now inside... Without Detective Gumshoe...)
Talk
Night of the murder
Phoenix:
I want to ask you about the night of the murder.
Lotta:
What? Ya really gonna shell out the bucks for the info I got!?
Phoenix:
Lotta, you were loitering in this hallway the night of the murder, were you not?
Lotta:
Well, kinda... But...
Phoenix:
(Brace yourself, Wright. Here it comes...)
Lotta:
I didn't exactly hang around here the entire time, ya know. Followed a few stars around... got a few autographs, shook a few hands, had a soda-pop with a few of 'em too.
Phoenix:
(Looks like she wasn't here the entire time, that night...)
Pearl:
The security lady also wasn't in this hallway the whole time either.
Phoenix:
(I guess this means there's no one who can tell us who came and went that night...)
Scandal
Phoenix:
So, about the note that was inside your camera case.
Lotta:
Oh, that ditty I wrote?
Phoenix:
Yeah... Can I believe what you've written?
Lotta:
Ya mean the stuff about Engarde shovin' his manager lady onto Corrida?
Phoenix:
Yeah...
Lotta:
Ah, well, I reckon ya best not be believin' that.
Phoenix:
What?
Lotta:
Look, I sorta wrote that on a whim, ya know? Writin' whatever came to mind.
Pearl:
"Whatever came to mind"...?
Lotta:
Yeah, when ya get down to it, it's just a lotta random bull dooders.
Phoenix:
...
Pearl:

Lotta:
Hey, what's with ya!? Why ya starin' at me like my grandpa used to!?
Phoenix:
Hmph.
Lotta:
Hey, and why do you look like you suddenly got older too!? Or am I just shrinkin' here!?
Pearl:
Umm...
Camera
Lotta:
Ah! My baby! My $1,600 baby! What's with that red-coated prosecutor anyhow!? The guy told me it was "evidence" and refused to give it back to me!
Phoenix:
Well, that's kind of how it is...
Lotta:
Hey, hey. Yer that red-coat's friend, ain't ya? So put in a few good words for me and git me back my camera.
Phoenix:
Y-You want me to do what!?
Lotta:
Listen, nag the guy real good fer 'bout five hours and I guarantee he'll give it back.
Phoenix:
Why don't you do your own dirty work...?
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
Um, would you please take a look at this?
Lotta:
Nope. Sorry. No can do. Only thing I wanna see is a steamin' hand towel.
Phoenix:
Um, what? A steaming hand towel...?
Lotta:
Need one for my eyes. Today just ain't a good day for my eyes to be lookin' at stuff.

Keep yerself together out there, ya hear!? I'm comin' to see ya in court tomorrow.
Phoenix:
O-OK, I'll see you then...

Yup. It's big, but it's a bed.
Pearl:
Aaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!

(How easily children are entertained.)
Floor near guitar case
Phoenix:
Bottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.
Pearl:
These glass shards...
Phoenix:
They're probably from the glass vase Ms. Andrews knocked over.
Guitar case
Pearl:
So, the Nickel Samurai's costume was in here?
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Pearl:
I can't believe Mr. Corrida went so far, just to say bad things about Mr. Engarde...
Phoenix:
W-Well, it was a "press conference", so he had to go in costume.
Pearl:
But weren't Mr. Engarde and Mr. Corrida friends?
Phoenix:
They weren't friends. They couldn't be friends because they were rivals.
Pearl:
So, a "rival" is someone who is a "strong enemy"!?
Phoenix:
(Pearls is really fired up over this... And I don't have an answer for her.)
Wine glass
Phoenix:
It's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.
Pearl:
Ewww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.
Phoenix:
There's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.
Talk
Night of the murder
Phoenix:
Please talk to me about the night of the murder just one more time.
Oldbag:
I talked about it plenty at the trial! I was fooled, tricked... DECEIVED by that fraud of a photographer and her note! She was loitering around here with that imbecilic look on her face!
Pearl:
"With that imbecilic look on her face"... OK, got it.
Oldbag:
N-Now hold on a second there you little pipsqueak! If you're going to take notes, at least make me sound better than that!
Pearl:
Oh, alright.
Phoenix:
(Now I've seen everything...)
Oldbag:
But you know, I was working that night too, doing my job, minding my own business. So it's not like I had time to waste standing around here the whole night.
Memories of Corrida
Phoenix:
I was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about Mr. Corrida.
Oldbag:
He was the most popular star, you know... Especially where it counts -- in my book!
Phoenix:
But I heard that he was lagging behind in the polls against Mr. Engarde...
Oldbag:
Um, w-well, that's just a recent thing. Bad luck and all that, you know. But! He was going to become an even bigger star than he used to be! Look! Just look at this mountain of presents! It's a show of the mountain of feelings all his fans had for him!
Phoenix:
Yeah, the mountain is pretty big, and certainly nothing to shake a stick at.
Pearl:
...Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Hm? What is it, Pearls?
Pearl:
The presents. They're all bears... right?
Phoenix:
(She's got a point... There isn't a single thing here that isn't a bear...)
Presents (appears after Memories of Corrida)
Phoenix:
All of Mr. Corrida's presents from his fans seem to be... bears...
Oldbag:
Oh, that's because you can't think of Juan without thinking about bears!
Pearl:
Bears...? Why bears?
Oldbag:
You don't know!? When my dear Juan was training, he fought barehanded with a bear. He refused to give in and let the bear win, but after the fight, they became friends.
Pearl:
Wow... What a heartwarming story.
Oldbag:
Look, it's just like in those young people's dramas. I can see those two tuckered out, down by a river going, "Heh... You... You sure can fight..." "You too, bub. You too."
Phoenix:
D-Did all that really happen?
Oldbag:
It's in his biography, bub.
Phoenix:
(What a load of crock!)
Oldbag:
So ever since then, fans have been giving him bears as presents.
Phoenix:
Yeah... Nice... Bears...

*GROOOOOOOOOOWL!* I'm Uncle Bear, and I say it's "bearly" 8 o'clock!
Phoenix:
Wh-Wh-What is that infernal racket!?
Oldbag:
It's one of the presents going off. Sounds like it's already 8 PM. Way past your bedtime!
Phoenix:
Urk... That startled me! I thought I was going to die for a second...
Pearl:
Eight PM... That's the time when the award ceremony ended that night, remember?

That's strange... I'm sure it was making a loud static noise.
Gumshoe:
Hmm... Maybe...
Phoenix:
Maybe what?
Gumshoe:
Maybe it was "electromagnetic interference", pal.
Phoenix:
"Electromagnetic interference"?
Picture Card
Phoenix:
Oh yeah! Do you know about this card?
Gumshoe:
Card?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth, for some reason, went pale the instant he saw this card.
Gumshoe:
Hey, I know what this is, pal!
Phoenix:
You do?
Gumshoe:
No matter what way you look at it, I'd say it's a picture of a shell.
Phoenix:

Um, that's it?
Gumshoe:
Oh yeah! That's right! Mr. Edgeworth really likes those cooked snail things. Um, what are they called again...? "Escargot" or something like that...?

Oh, when you put it that way...
Pearl:
I don't understand what you're talking about...
Gumshoe:
Like for example, when a cell phone goes off next to a computer screen, the stuff on the screen gets kinda fuzzy and starts acting funny, right?
Pearl:
Huh? ..."Kom-pu-ter"?
Gumshoe:
... Um, it's like when you use the dryer next to the TV, and the screen starts looking weird.
Pearl:
O-Oh, yes, the TV does do that! Hmm... Oh, so that's what you're talking about!
Phoenix:
(She seems amazingly happy at being able to understand this...)
Gumshoe:
So the room you were in when that interference to the transceiver happened... There's gotta be something there that's sending out very strong radio waves, pal! Something like... Hmm... Like a listening device or something.
Phoenix:
Ah!
Gumshoe:
Hey, speaking of that! Where were you when it happened?
Pearl:
We were in Mr. Corrida's room... The scene of the murder!
Gumshoe:
What!? That's it! I'm going to sneak into the precinct and get a bug sweeper! I'll meet you at the crime scene later, alright pal!?
Phoenix:
Ah, wait! Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Oh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!
Pearl:
We should be going too, Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
Alright, let's go!
Examine
Desk
Phoenix:
My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...
Pearl:
Oh! I cleaned it up even more for you last night!

Gumshoe:
Hey! You're finally here, pal!
Phoenix:
S-Sorry to keep you waiting.
Pearl:
Do you have the... um... "bug sweeper"?
Gumshoe:
Um, well, you see... I got busted trying to sneak in, pal. Then suddenly, I'm staring at the precinct doors. ...From the outside, I mean. So yeah... I couldn't get one of the police bug sweepers...
Phoenix:
... What do you mean you couldn't get it!? We need that item!
Gumshoe:
Hey, hey, calm down, pal. I didn't say I didn't get one, just not the police's.
Pearl:
Wow... So this is a "bug sweeper"...
Phoenix:
It looks a little... broken.
Gumshoe:
Hey, this was made when I was in elementary school, pal.
Phoenix:
Oh? By who?
Gumshoe:
Me, of course! Ah, seeing this sure brings back memories...
Phoenix:
...
Gumshoe:
Hey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little run down... But I put my heart and soul into building this puppy here!
Pearl:
Your heart and soul...?
Gumshoe:
It'll work! Trust me, pal, it'll do the job! But...
Phoenix:
But...?
Gumshoe:
But you can't set the sensitivity... So it's going to beep at anything that gives off electromagnetic waves.
Pearl:
But isn't it better that way?
Gumshoe:
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho! Well, anyway, since I brought it all this way, might as well give it a whirl, right pal?
Phoenix:
(I'm getting that sinking feeling again...)
Gumshoe:
OK, now I'll tell you how to use this baby! There's a listening device or some other sort of bug hidden in this room, pal.
Pearl:
So we're going to find it, right?
Gumshoe:
Right. Now, first, let's turn the sweeper on. Next, touch the sweeper and take a real good look around the room with it, pal. You can see how strong the radio waves are in an area by looking at the CHECK gauge. Once you find something that's giving off strong waves, the gauge will change... And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the thing a long hard stare. There's a lot of things here that's going to give off radio waves, so let's take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Alright! I'm going to go stand outside and keep an eye out. Give me a yell if you find the bug. Got it, pal!?
Bug sweeper (left side)
Calculator
Phoenix:
It's a plain old calculator.
Pearl:
It says "50" on it. Maybe he was calculating his allowance?
Phoenix:
(A whole 50 cents?? Um, maybe if he was a spirit medium...)
Clock bear
Phoenix:
Well, it certainly looks like an alarm clock.
Pearl:
What's wrong? Why do you look troubled?
Phoenix:
I just can't imagine the listening device being inside this alarm clock. It just, um, sort of reminded me of something that happened a long time ago...
Pearl:
Oh...
Phoenix:
Well, anyway, it looks like the listening device isn't in here.
Box next to clock bear
Pearl:
Wow, there's a really delicious loaf of bread in here!
Phoenix:
Looks like it's been on "keep warm" all this time since the murder.
Pearl:
Well, Mr. Scruffy Detective always says, "Got to keep the trail and crime scene warm."
Phoenix:
(I think the "keep warm" in that case is a little more metaphorical...)
Video camera
Pearl:
What's this?
Phoenix:
It's a small video camera. ...No listening device in this gizmo.
Pearl:
Everyone's trying to make everything smaller and smaller lately, aren't they Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
That's what it seems like.
Pearl:
But! I want to grow bigger and bigger!
Phoenix:
(Well, eating only vegetables isn't going to help you there. You have to eat meat too...)
Remote control
Phoenix:
It's the TV's remote control. But it doesn't look like the listening device is in here.
Pearl:
Um, so I was thinking... I wonder if a TV remote works on other things... Like... Could I make you change your expressions like TV channels? Zap!
Phoenix:
H-Hey! (Hmm, but if I could... Ooh, the people I would give the ol' mute button to!) Well, I don't think it's going to work on me... Why don't we try it on Maya tomorrow, OK?
Pearl:
... OK!
Laptop
Phoenix:
There's no listening device in that notebook computer, huh.
Pearl:
Umm... What's a "notebook computer"...?
Phoenix:
... Do you know what a "notebook" is?
Pearl:
Yes! It's a small book with paper that you can write on! ...So?
Phoenix:
Well, that thing is like a notebook in a way. It's basically a small laptop.
Pearl:
Umm... Mr. Nick... What's a "laptop"...?
Refrigerator
Pearl:
This is a... a refrigerator, right?
Phoenix:
I really don't think the listening device is in something like this.
Pearl:
Because it's filled with nothing but healty vegetable juices, right!?
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah, sure. (What does that have to do with listening devices?)
Coffee pot
Pearl:
What's this? It sort of looks like a hot water pot, but...
Phoenix:
Oh, well, it's kind of like a hot water pot, I guess. But instead of hot water, coffee comes out.
Pearl:
Really!? Th-This pot can do that!? ... Um, is there a pot that orange juice comes out of...?
Phoenix:
I don't think there's anything like that, Pearls. Sorry.
Water pot
Pearl:
Oh, the water in this hot water pot has run out! I'll go get more water for it!
Phoenix:
O-OK. Sounds good. (Looks like she's forgotten all about looking for the listening device...)
Biggest bear
Leads to:
"This is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right?"
Bug sweeper (right side)
Air conditioner
Phoenix:
Well, the listening device isn't in the air conditioner.
Pearl:
Aah! Yuck! This air filter is covered in dust and dirt...
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah...
Pearl:
... Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's wash it!
Phoenix:
(I wonder if being a neat freak makes even the tiniest dust bunny look colossal...?)
Pearl:
...What?
Phoenix:
O-Oh, nothing.
TV
Phoenix:
I don't really think the listening device is in the TV of all places.
Pearl:
Looks like the TV was left on, and it's now showing an old samurai movie.
Phoenix:
Yeah. This channel plays all sorts of international movies, as well as domestic ones.
Pearl:
You know, every time I watch one of these old movies, I always think, "Wow, these Japanese stars are really good at English!"
Phoenix:
...Um, yeah.
Pearl:
When I grow up, I want to study Japanese!
Phoenix:
(I should probably keep my mouth shut here, and not destroy her dream...)
Lamps
Phoenix:
Lamp, check. Listening device... nope.
Pearl:
There are a lot of lamps in this room, aren't there Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Pearl:
And they're all on. You shouldn't do that, Mr. Nick. Don't you know that's wasteful?
Phoenix:
...Ah, yeah... I'll be more conscientious from now on. Sorry.
Cell phone
Phoenix:
A cell phone... Nope, no bugs in here.
Pearl:
A "cell phone"...?
Phoenix:
Wh-What!? Don't tell me you don't know what a cell phone is!
Pearl:
...I'm sorry. I've never seen one before...
Phoenix:
(Now that she mentions it, my cell phone couldn't get any reception while I was staying in Kurain Village... And Pearls has never lived outside of that village, so... Well, I guess I can't say it's impossible to live without one...)
Landline phone
Phoenix:
Well, the phone is the most common place for a "listening device", I'd say. But, let's take the receiver apart first before we get ahead of ourselves here.
Pearl:
Wow, you know a lot about electronics, don't you Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I know tons. Especially when it comes to taking them apart. It's my specialty. (I'll leave the fixing part up to Gumshoe...)
Pearl:
So...? Is there a "listening device" in there?
Phoenix:
...No. (And I really thought it had to be in the phone too...)
Bear between the two sofas
Pearl:
Ah, what a lovely bear...
*GROOOOOOOOOOOOWL!*
Pearl:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!
Phoenix:
Ah, this must be one of those fancy bear-shaped toy robots.
Pearl:
I-It's a robot!? It's a REAL robot!?
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, it's a real one.
Pearl:
Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
Pearl:
H-How many horse-powers is it? How many horsies!?
Phoenix:
Horsies...? ...
Phoenix:
Um... Well, look, it's a bear, so... uh...
Pearl:
Um...
Radio
Pearl:
The radio is on and playing something. Oh! It's "Kids' Question Corner"!
"Professor! Professor! Why is the Earth round?"
Pearl:
... Yes, why is it, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
... Why don't you listen to the radio program a little more, Pearls?
Nothing to Examine
Pearl:
There doesn't seem to be anything giving off radio waves there, Mr. Nick. Keep a careful eye on the CHECK gauge, and let's try again!
Phoenix:
(This sweeper isn't exactly the best... Well, make do with what you have, right?)
(Examining Biggest bear leads to:)
Pearl:
This is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right? It's the biggest one I have ever seen!
Gumshoe:
Hey! So did you guys find it yet? The listening device, I mean...
Pearl:
No, not yet. But this bear's eye is...
Gumshoe:
Let's see, let's see... A perfectly normal stuffed bear with some really strong radio waves... Sounds like you found the device to me, pal. Let's dig this big fella's eye out and see what we've got.
Pearl:
N-No! You can't! Such... Such a violent act...
Gumshoe:
Oomph! *rip!*
Pearl:
Noooooooooo!
Gumshoe:
...
Phoenix:
Th-That's!
Gumshoe:
It's a miniature camera... And it looks like there's more. There's a... transmitter, and a timer.
Phoenix:
A whattawhatta-mitter?
Gumshoe:
A transmitter, pal.
Pearl:
Oh... Is this more of that "high tech" stuff...?
Talk
Camera
Phoenix:
So this tiny thing is a camera...?
Gumshoe:
Yup. It's a pinhole CCD camera, pal. It's a small, high-grade video camera mostly used in security systems.
Phoenix:
So it's a video camera...
Gumshoe:
It runs on a battery, which comes with it in a set.
Phoenix:
But... there's no video tape in this camera...
Gumshoe:
This is only the camera part here, pal. The tape recorder with the tape inside it is somewhere else.
Pearl:
Somewhere else?
Gumshoe:
The footage is changed into radio waves and then it's sent to that recorder.
Pearl:
So... It's sort of like a TV broadcast, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
Hey, you know, you're right!
Spy Camera added to the Court Record.
Transmitter
Phoenix:
So... what is a "transmitter"?
Gumshoe:
It's a device that sends footage the camera took to a specific destination. It's like a video version of a listening device, pal.
Phoenix:
It looks like it's attached to a small, clock-like thing...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that's a timer, pal. You can set it to turn the camera on and record at a certain time with it.
Pearl:
You can set it for a certain time...?
Gumshoe:
Yup. Let's see... This looks like it was set to start at 8 PM and go for one hour.
Phoenix:
Eight PM? (That was the time the award ceremony ended!)
Gumshoe:
There's no date set, so it's been recording every night, I'd guess.
Pearl:
M-Mr. Detective! How long has this bear been here...?
Gumshoe:
Um, I'm pretty sure it's been here since the night of the murder.
Pearl:
Then... Then maybe...
Gumshoe:
Maybe this camera caught the murder on tape!
Phoenix:
Wh-What!?
Gumshoe:
And if you think about the angle the bear is at... It's bound to have had a clear shot of the whole crime, pal!
Transmitter added to the Court Record.
Stuffed bear
Pearl:
So there was a camera... in this bear's eye...
Phoenix:
And it was disguised as a present.
Gumshoe:
And I'm sure it was here on the night of the murder, pal. It's pretty big, so it stands out pretty well in my mind.
Phoenix:
But... who gave Mr. Corrida this present?
Gumshoe:
I, ah, don't know, pal. But! This means that someone out there's got a video of what happened here that night!
Pearl:
Isn't there any way we can find out who that person is?
Gumshoe:
It's impossible, pal. Radio waves can be sent almost anywhere, so there's no real way to find out...
Pearl:
Oh... *sniffle*
Phoenix:
(Is there really no way to find out...?)
Stuffed Bear added to the Court Record.
Present
Picture Card
Gumshoe:
So... the assassin's name is Shelly de Killer?
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Gumshoe:
And because he's "Shelly", that's why he leaves a "shell" card?
Phoenix:
Yes.
Gumshoe:
... Ho ho ho ho! Oh, that's great. But you know, no matter how strange I may seem, at least my jokes don't make you cringe. Right, pal?
Phoenix:
(Umm... Yeah, you keep on thinking that...)
Spy Camera
Pearl:
It's a really tiiiiny camera.
Gumshoe:
A camera this size lasts about 3 hours with a fresh battery pack, pal.
Phoenix:
But what would something like this be doing in...?
Gumshoe:
Well, I'd say taking a secret video of the murder.
Phoenix:
(Which means... Someone knew there was going to be a murder here!)
Transmitter
Gumshoe:
This device looks like it was made by the criminal themselves. If it's only sending images, then I'd say it'd last about 80 hours, pal.
Pearl:
You know a lot about these things, don't you Mr. Detective? Is spying on people a hobby of yours...?
Gumshoe:
Well, no... I mean... You're making me embarrassed, putting me on the spot like this.
Phoenix:
(Why should he be embarrassed? Is there something I'm not getting here...?)
Stuffed Bear
Pearl:
The bear is really lovely, isn't it? It's so soft and fuzzy, and the face is really well-made...
Phoenix:
(Well, I guess when you compare it to all the other presents, it is well-made.)
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but I don't think the bear itself is a clue to this case at all.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Gumshoe:
... ...I got it!
Phoenix:
Wh-What!?
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal. Let me borrow this mini camera for a bit!
Phoenix:
Wh-What are you going to do?
Gumshoe:
I'm going to go around to the electronic shops and see if I can find out who bought this!
Phoenix:
B-But that's impossible! I mean, it's already 9 PM!
Gumshoe:
Leave it to me! Even if I have to search all night, I'll find your man, pal!
Spy Camera and Transmitter given to Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Oh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!
Pearl:
...He's gone.
Phoenix:
...Yeah.
Pearl:
But Mr. Scruffy Detective sure is a nice man. He's pushing himself so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake...
???:
...You always manage to do things in the most ineffective ways.
Phoenix:
(Ack!)
Edgeworth:
You'll have to excuse me. I heard your conversation just now.
Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth! What are you doing here!?
Edgeworth:
A rescue team has been created and deployed. I can't say I'm optimistic... but we have to move forward, one step at a time.
Phoenix:
I-I see... Thanks.
Edgeworth:
Don't thank me yet. We still have to find her.
Pearl:
...
Edgeworth:
Hmm... So, there was a spy camera hidden inside this stuffed animal, huh? You are one lucky man, Wright.
Phoenix:
?
Edgeworth:
Do you know this stuffed bear, little girl?
Pearl:
Um... I have no idea!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Of course not. The maker of this bear is a very expensive, luxury brand from overseas. It's completely hand-made and there are very few that are exported here.
Phoenix:
Wh-What?
Edgeworth:
The camera and transmitter that scatterbrained detective took with him are dead ends. Things like those can be bought anywhere... However, this bear is different. By tracking how it got into this country, this bear can tell us who the buyer is.
Pearl:
C-Can you really do that!? Mr. Nick, can he really?
Phoenix:
W-Well, I guess so...
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It's 9 PM. I think I can still make it in time.
Phoenix:
?
Edgeworth:
I'll be taking this for now. I'm sure you have other things you have to do.
Stuffed Bear snatched up by Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
See you soon, Wright.
Phoenix:
W-Wait!
Edgeworth:
What?
Phoenix:
Why are you doing this...?
Edgeworth:
... I have no interest in explaining myself to someone who cannot comprehend. But besides that, Wright. Until court reconvenes tomorrow, you should concern yourself with this question: "Who was the person that murdered Juan Corrida?"
Phoenix:
The "real killer"...
Edgeworth:
Do you really still think it was Adrian Andrews?
Phoenix:
To be honest... I don't know anymore.
Edgeworth:
... You still have a little time left... Find the truth, Wright. Everything begins with the truth.
Phoenix:
(Juan Corrida's real killer... Ms. Andrews' past... The kidnapper whose sole condition is an acquittal for Mr. Engarde... And... this card. Shelly de Killer...) ...Maya. The only way I can save you now, is to find all the answers to this case tonight! I don't understand what your real intentions are, Edgeworth... but as you said, all I can do for now is find the truth!
To be continued.
March 22, 9:14 PMGatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room
Pearl:
It's past 9:00 PM already, isn't it? I wonder... I wonder if Mr. Edgeworth has already found Mystic Maya...?
Phoenix:
(These things take time. I'd say probably not...) The police are professionals, Pearls. They'll find her, so don't you worry. And if we can win a not guilty verdict tomorrow... then everything will be OK.
Pearl:
Y-You're right... ...
Talk
The real killer
Phoenix:
So the real person who killed Mr. Corrida was...
Pearl:
That assassin... Mr. Shelly de Killer, right?
Phoenix:
And the card Ms. Andrews found at the crime scene seems to be proof of that. But if that's the case, then a new question comes to mind. Who was the one that hired De Killer to begin with? Who is his client?
Pearl:
You mean... Who asked for the murder...?
Phoenix:
That person didn't want to dirty their own hands in blood, but whoever this client is, they're still a killer.
Pearl:
...
The assassin's client
Pearl:
Who... Who could have hired the assassin? Do you think it was Ms. Andrews...?
Phoenix:
(I wonder... But if she was the client... then why go through the effort to stab the knife into the corpse herself...?)
Pearl:
But if Ms. Andrews wasn't the client... Then... No, it can't be...
Phoenix:
(...Matt Engarde himself...?)
Was it Matt? (appears after The real killer and The assassin's client)
Pearl:
If Mr. Engarde really did hire the assassin...
Phoenix:
Then he is not innocent at all. Far from it, he would be guilty of the crime.
Pearl:
B-But it can't be Mr. Engarde, right!? I mean, when we first talked with him...
Phoenix:
...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Did you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?
Engarde:
... Alright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?
Phoenix:
(I didn't see any Psyche-Locks at that time... Actually... That reminds me...)
Pearl:
Did you remember something, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Yeah, something Ms. Andrews said at the trial today. She said something interesting.
Something interesting (appears after Was it Matt?)
Pearl:
Um... So what is this "interesting thing"?
Phoenix:
Oh, that's right. You didn't hear it, did you Pearls?
Andrews:
Juan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.
Andrews:
It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!
Pearl:
Mr. Engarde's "secret"...!? Wh-What is this secret...?
Phoenix:
I don't know yet. But for now, let's think about it this way. Mr. Corrida was going to reveal this "secret". That means... Mr. Engarde had plenty of motive to have Mr. Corrida silenced. ... (Which means we have to meet with Mr. Engarde. There's no way around it now.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Pearl:
I... I believe in your lawyer powers, Mr. Nick. I know you can bring us a miracle.
Phoenix:
(I'm guessing by "miracle", she means a not guilty verdict... And she wouldn't be wrong either. It will take a miracle to pull this one off.)
Radio Transceiver
Pearl:
Why... Why did the kidnapper have to take Mystic Maya...? Why couldn't he have taken me instead!?
Phoenix:
Stop it, Pearls! Don't say things like that! If that had happened, then Maya would be hurting, I'm sure of it. Just like how you are hurting now, Pearls.
Pearl:
Y-You're right...
Maya Fey profile
Pearl:
One more day...
Phoenix:
Yeah... If we can bring the trial to its end, she'll be back. Don't worry.
Pearl:
I decided I won't cry anymore, Mr. Nick. You're so brave and holding strong for Mystic Maya, so I have to do the same.
Pearl Fey profile
Pearl:
If only I had studied harder during my training... I could be a bigger help to you, Mr. Nick.
Phoenix:
Ah, don't worry about it. Really. Pearls, you're doing a great job...
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! Is there a waterfall around here!? I feel that I must be made new under the rushing spring waters!
Phoenix:
Sorry, Pearls... The only body of water around here is a lake.
Pearl:
Oh... Thanks anyway...
Dick Gumshoe profile
Pearl:
This is the first time I've ever met someone who loves to eat instant noodles.
Phoenix:
(Something tells me Gumshoe isn't eating them because he genuinely likes them, but...)
Pearl:
He's working so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake... I'm going to get him lots and lots of instant noodles as a thank your present!
Juan Corrida profile
Pearl:
Um... Is it really that important to be the Master of all the Stars? So important that you try to find your friends' weaknesses, and then expose them...?
Phoenix:
I... I wouldn't know...
Matt Engarde profile
Pearl:
I-Is it really alright for us to trust him? This person... Mr. Engarde...?
Phoenix:
... (I-I don't know... I can't even answer that for myself. We have to go see him one more time! That's the only way to know for sure!)
Security Lady profile
Pearl:
Um... I was wondering if that old lady is really a person from Earth. I mean, maybe she's really from waaaaaay out in outer space...
Phoenix:
Yeah, actually, I was thinking the same exact thing. She's too strange to be from Earth.
Adrian Andrews profile
Pearl:
Why did Ms. Andrews... Why did she frame Mr. Engarde, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
(She has some sort of grudge against Mr. Engarde... But why is that? That's something we still have to figure out...) Let's go ask her, OK?
Celeste Inpax profile
Pearl:
This person was Ms. Andrews' mentor... And she... killed herself, right?
Phoenix:
(Right. And Mr. Corrida hid Ms. Inpax's suicide note... So to get it back, Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... But the thing is, where is that suicide note now?)

Hey! Wait!
Oldbag:
What is it, whippersnapper!? All I know is nothing that has anything to do with you is ever good! Like just now. I was handed this strange device for who knows what reason. And I was told to use it to search the whole hotel.
Phoenix:
That's... the bug sweeper, isn't it? (The one Gumshoe made...)
Oldbag:
I don't know and frankly, I don't care. But the request came from Edgey-poo, so...
Phoenix:
Edgeworth...?
Oldbag:
And he said,
Edgeworth:
"If you feel angry, direct your anger at that unsophisticated lawyer."
Oldbag:
So, I'm going to feel free to direct all my anger towards you!
Phoenix:
(Ugh... Gee, thanks a bundle, Edgeworth! What a pal you are!)

Tables at the back
Phoenix:
They haven't cleaned up all the food yet.
Oldbag:
Don't you touch it without permission! I brought a lunch box today, so I could pack it.

This is absolutely top secret, so you had better keep it to yourselves! I heard they found a spy camera hidden in one of the presents!
Phoenix:
Hmm, very interesting.
Oldbag:
I'm sure it was... you know... It was to catch poor Juan in the middle of a scandalous "meeting"!
Pearl:
"Scandalous"...? What's that?
Oldbag:
It means... Well, you know, that gossip that's been going around about my dear Juan.
Phoenix:
Oh... You mean that thing about Ms. Andrews. (But I'm sure she must've had some reason for getting close to Mr. Corrida...)
Oldbag:
I'll let you in on another secret, young'un. I know who planted that spy camera! It was that obnoxious, puffy-haired photographer girl! The nerve of some people! Spying on people by herself! As if I wouldn't want to see it for myself too!
Phoenix:
(Wow! The alien actually admitted her true intentions for a change!)
Oldbag:
I don't know what you're thinking exactly, but I can bet that it's nothing good!!
Phoenix:
(But I didn't say anything...)
Juan and Adrian
Oldbag:
So you want to know about Juan and that manager, right? Actually, as I hear it, they were something of a refreshing pair, those two.
Phoenix:
Oh?
Oldbag:
I tell you, Juan really welcomed that manager with open arms, I heard.
Pearl:
That "manager"...? Who are you talking about?
Oldbag:
You don't know? That manager woman Juan had. It's a shame she killed herself, though...
Phoenix:
Oh, you're talking about Ms. Celeste Inpax... Ms. Andrews' mentor, right?
Oldbag:
Yes, yes, that's the one! That Celeste girl. She was supposed to get married, you know.
Phoenix:
M-Married? You mean... to Mr. Corrida?
Oldbag:
*sigh* Really, you young kids today don't know anything, do you? That girl Celeste killed herself three days after their marriage announcement!
Phoenix:
(Three days after their marriage announcement!? What in the...!?)
Celeste's suicide (appears after Juan and Adrian)
Pearl:
Why would Ms. Inpax want to kill herself!? She was going to get married!
Oldbag:
Well, that's because... she was thrown away, you see, by Juan.
Phoenix:
What!?
Pearl:
B-But... They were going to get married, right? They promised each other, right?
Oldbag:
They held a grand announcement session... But... Three days later... Juan suddenly cancelled their marriage.
Phoenix:
I-Is that true?
Oldbag:
It was in the weekly magazines.
Pearl:
B-But why!? Why did he do that!?
Oldbag:
That was not in the magazines, unfortunately.
Phoenix:
...I see.
Oldbag:
That night after Juan called off the wedding, that manager, Celeste, killed herself.
Phoenix:
How terrible...
Pearl:
I wonder what happened between those two...?

Ah, yes sir.

Well, we've finally found just the person we've been looking for. A real decisive witness.
Phoenix:
A "decisive witness"? You mean for Mr. Engarde's case?

We're taking the witness' statement right now. Gotta hand it to Mr. Edgeworth.

Wh-Who is this witness?

I think you know this person quite well, Mr. Lawyer.
Pearl:
M-Mr. Nick...?
Phoenix:
(Between the kidnapper's demand and now this... I can't see any way to win here!)
Chief:
Oh, yeah... Mr. Edgeworth wanted me to tell you something.
Phoenix:
He did?
Chief:
Even though visiting hours are long over at the detention center, he wanted me to grant you special permission, so there you go.
Pearl:
Eh!?

I've already called them so they know. Go on, go talk to your heart's content.

Chief Detective
Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.

Yeah. I heard a little more about it from Ms. Andrews.

It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!

So, it's like that.

Phoenix:
Did you know about Mr. Corrida and Ms. Andrews' relationship...?
Engarde:
Well, it's all over the tabloids, dude. Ah, but I don't know any of the details, if that's what you mean. Look, how many times do I have to tell you? I don't care what Juan did with his life.
Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews... She had a purpose in mind when she started seeing Mr. Corrida. Her mentor was Mr. Corrida's manager... and Ms. Andrews was going to get Ms. Celeste Inpax's suicide note from him.
Engarde:
Celeste...
Phoenix:
Does that jog any memories...?
Engarde:
... Dude, I suddenly just got totally hungry. You up for a pizza? My treat.

Let's go eat one later, OK?

Phoenix:
That's too bad...

Phoenix:
Could you please take a look at this...? I know it may not seem important to you...
Engarde:
Well, if it's not important, then I'd rather be in bed. If I don't get my 12 hours of beauty sleep, my skin's gonna wrinkle up like a prune, dude.

You know, he's right Mr. Nick. Your skin's kind of drying up here and there.

I'm sorry to be visiting at such a late hour. But there are a few questions I absolutely have to ask you tonight.

Andrews:

Talk
Matt Engarde
Phoenix:
I'd like to ask you about Matt Engarde, if you don't mind...
Andrews:
Mr. Wright... You still don't know, do you? The real him, I mean...
Phoenix:
... You seem to bear a lot of resentment towards Mr. Engarde. If that's the case, then why did you become his manager? And why would you become intimate with his rival?
Andrews:
... That... has nothing to do with this case. Nothing.
Celeste Inpax
Phoenix:
About Ms. Celeste Inpax...
Andrews:
I had finally put her death behind me... And now, thanks to you, it's all come back to the surface.
Phoenix:
I... I'm sorry.
Andrews:
Yes, I was shocked by her suicide. And it's true that when I heard the rumor that Juan was the one who had hidden her suicide note, I began to draw close to him. I wanted to get her suicide note back... and to burn it.
Phoenix:
You wanted to "burn it"? But why?
Andrews:
I didn't want it to spread like just another piece of gossip. But... I never held any murderous intent towards Juan. I would never do something so stupid.
Phoenix:
(The suicide note, huh...? I wonder what it said?)
Why frame him? (appears after Matt Engarde and Celeste Inpax)
Phoenix:
Why did you try to frame Mr. Engarde?
Andrews:
That's simple. Because he's the killer, that's why. Isn't it the duty of every good citizen to inform the police?
Pearl:
B-But... there had to be another way.
Phoenix:
The police are excellent at doing their job, so they'd figure it out, right?
Andrews:
Yes, they're so good that they couldn't figure out the real truth behind Celeste's death.
Pearl:
Ms. Andrews...
Phoenix:
Well, um, I know you're not the type of person to do something without a reason, so please, tell me why you did what you did...
Andrews:
...Revenge.
Pearl:
Huh...? Did you say something just now...?
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
Phoenix:
(A Psyche-Lock, huh...)
Andrews:
Don't you understand yet? You're not my lawyer. To be honest, you're more like my enemy.
Pearl:
But...
Phoenix:
(I'm sure I just heard Ms. Andrews say, "Revenge".)
Why frame him? (after Psyche-Lock appears)
Phoenix:
Why did you frame Mr. Engarde...?
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
Andrews:
Hmm, I wonder why...? I don't really know myself. When I realized what I was doing, I had already stabbed the knife into the body.
Phoenix:
(I'm almost sure that just now... Ms. Andrews muttered, "Revenge" to herself.)
Present
Press Conference Ticket
Andrews:
I was the one who organized the whole press conference. Juan wanted to deal the most damage possible to Matt's career. And that's why he was killed. It's quite simply a story of cause and effect, yes?
Magazine Clipping
Andrews:
It appears to me that rumor was started by Juan himself.
Phoenix:
Mr. Corrida...? But...
Andrews:
I'm Matt's manager, remember. I think he wanted to embarrass Matt through his relationship with me.
Pearl:
But... But didn't Mr. Corrida like you...!?
Andrews:
There weren't any feelings of love between us. For me, it was about getting Celeste's suicide note... For him, it was about wounding Matt's pride. That's all it was.
Pearl:
That's... That's...
Phoenix:
(Poor Pearls is in shock. She sees just how cruel the world can really be.)
Guitar Case
Phoenix:
So there was a Nickel Samurai costume inside of this case, correct?
Andrews:
Yes, there was. I even personally carried it here from the studio. I always thought it was such a childish thing to dress up and wear a costume like that, but I never thought that I would wind up using it myself that night.
Wine Glass
Andrews:
When I was pouring that glass of juice... I honestly had no idea that Juan was dead...
Pearl:
I see...
Andrews:
I really am a terrible woman, aren't I? One moment, I'm thinking of looking after him, and the next, I'm stabbing him in the chest with a knife.
Crime Photo
Phoenix:
About this photo...
Andrews:
The person who stabbed the body and opened the guitar case was me.
Phoenix:
And that was so you could get the Nickel Samurai's costume out so you could wear it...?
Andrews:
I thought I had executed that part quite well. But you showed me differently. You are a formidable lawyer, Mr. Wright.
Jammin' Ninja's Button, Knife or Lotta's photo
Andrews:
You know... There was only one thought running through my head at that time. "With this, I can finally expose Matt's true nature to the world."
Phoenix:
(His "true nature"...? I wonder why she's saying that, but not telling me what his true nature is? If it were me, I think I'd be happy to finally get that kind of thing off my chest.)
Suicide Report
Andrews:
I don't care what the reason was... It's unforgivable that he hid Celeste's suicide note.
Phoenix:
But you don't have any proof that she left a suicide note behind, right?
Andrews:
Celeste... She always believed there was a right way and a wrong way to do anything. She would have left a note. I... I wholly believe that.
Attempted Suicide Report
Andrews:
S-Stop it! I don't want to remember the hopelessness and the despair I felt back then!
Pearl:
Hurry up and put that away, Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
I-I'm so sorry!
Picture Card
Andrews:
It was near Juan's dead body. I... I noticed it when I went to fill the glass. And then when I realized that Juan was dead... I completely panicked. That's when I must have unconsciously picked this card up and put it into my pocket. As for why...? I simply don't know.

Andrews:
...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.

Andrews:
He is a very prideful man... Or rather, was. He absolutely had to compete with Matt in everything, no matter what it was. He really was such an idiot.

O-Oh.

They said my face and whole self in general looked "suspicious" or something.

So, about this "testimony" you're giving. What are you going to talk about?
Powers:
Ah, I really don't know yet... But it sounds like I saw something pretty important from what they tell me.
Phoenix:
You saw something important? What was it?
Powers:
Ah, well, the detective told me not to talk about it. "You can't tell anyone, and especially not that lawyer," he said.
Pearl:
Who do you think is "that lawyer" the detective was talking about...?
Phoenix:
I'm going to take a wild guess and say it's me.
Powers:
...Y-Yeah, you got it.
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! Mystic Maya and myself are your only two allies in this whole world, but it's alright!
Phoenix:
(Ouch... I don't really have a lot of friends, do I...?)
Matt Engarde
Powers:
This is going to do a lot of damage to Matt, you know. Because he's got that "refreshing like a spring breeze" image going.
Phoenix:
But what is he really like?
Powers:
Well, let's see. Matt's always been kind of a "player" with women... He would never really turn a pretty face away, if you know what I mean... He'd always say, "It's just a game" to justify himself.
Pearl:
What!? H-How horrible! That's unforgivable!
Powers:
Oww. S-Sorry. Didn't mean to offend you. But you know, he said once that, "There's only one person in the world who won't swoon over me."
Phoenix:
One person who wouldn't swoon over him?
Powers:
His manager, you know. Ms. Adrian Andrews.
Phoenix:
(Why is Mr. Powers suddenly looking kind of... energetic?)
Gossip
Powers:
Ah, you see, I'm actually a sucker for gossip. I mean, celebrities and their world have this dazzling sort of image, right?
Phoenix:
A dazzling sort of image? But aren't you a part of that dazzle, Mr. Powers?
Powers:
No, I'm more of a hairy, sweaty, smelly, brutish kind of guy, you see. But it's OK, really. I get to hear plenty of gossip about a lot of the other stars around me as things happen.
Phoenix:
Well, that's true.
Powers:
Oh, hey! So did you hear about this yet? About Ms. Andrews' mentor and her suicide...?
Phoenix:
You mean Ms. Inpax?
Pearl:
We heard something about how her wedding was cancelled...
Powers:
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about! I thought about it a little the other day! About that mysterious death! Hey, Mr. Wright! Why don't you ask me about that!? Go on, go ahead!
Phoenix:
(Mr. Powers is so charged up his skin is practically glowing with electricity...)
Celeste's suicide (appears after Gossip)
Powers:
Hey, so have you heard this? Celeste left a suicide note! And they say that Juan went and hid it...
Phoenix:
We heard about that in court today. (But there wasn't any actual proof that she had left a note...)
Powers:
Well, this is what I think. I think that something bad was written on that note. Something bad for Juan, that is.
Pearl:
Something bad for Mr. Corrida?
Phoenix:
Why do you figure so?
Powers:
Well, before she died, Celeste talked with a few of her friends. And she said, "It looks like I may have been caught by an insidious man..."
Phoenix:
An "insidious man"...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that?
Powers:
Well, there's no one else that fits the bill, right? And that would be reason enough for him to hide the suicide note!
Phoenix:
I see... Well, that's some good info. Thank you.
Powers:
Y-You're welcome!

Hey! That article! Is that from "Gossip Land"?

Oh, they wrote a little something about me once! "Steel Samurai's Midnight Dine and Dash".

Powers:
The Jammin' Ninja made me want a bright red guitar, you know. I wanted to be cool like him, so I went out and bought one.
Phoenix:
Oh... That's nice...
Powers:
Ah, but you don't understand. I can't get a single sound to come out of it. Because I sort of tripped on it and crushed it... the day after I bought it.

And this bear's what gave them away, pal!

Pearl:
Um... Wasn't that Mr. Edgeworth that figured...
Phoenix:
Shh, Pearls. ...And? Go on.
Gumshoe:
There's only one person who bought one of those bears who's related to this crime!

Are you sure you heard right!? That the person who bought this bear was...
Gumshoe:
I heard it from the department store clerk, pal. This is the credit card receipt for the purchase. It's for $3,800, pal. That's an exact match to the price of that stuffed bear.
Phoenix:
A receipt...? That's all you have?
Gumshoe:
Nah, it's not just the receipt, pal. The store clerk said so himself. He told me, "I'm sure I sold the bear to Mr. Engarde." I mean, the clerk even got Mr. Engarde's autograph out of it, pal. So I'm sure the person that bought the stuffed bear was Mr. Engarde himself!
Phoenix:
(My... My sight is failing me... Th-This can't be!)
Credit Card Receipt added to the Court Record.
Spy camera

So what about the spy camera we found...?

Phoenix:
You mean setting the spy camera up in the victim's room...?

Why... Why would Mr. Engarde do something like this!?
Gumshoe:
I bet it was to catch Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida in one of their rendezvous.
Phoenix:
"I bet" is not good enough for me. I have to know the absolute truth behind this camera.

Engarde:
I told you before, dude. I don't know! I don't know anything about Juan, OK? Look, Mr. Wright. I can keep on saying it until I'm blue in the face, but... I totally didn't pay Juan any attention the whole time that night! I mean, come on! I was in the middle of a nap!

But I'm no weakling. I don't believe anyone... least of all assassins.

Oh, come now, Mr. Wright. Assassins aren't above blackmail. They turn their clients into cashcows by holding the sinful deed over their heads. And a superstar like me, how much do you think I'm worth? Care to guess?
Pearl:
And... And that's why...?
Engarde:
Yes, that's where the video comes in. It's got his face and the crime scene recorded on it, preserved for all time. With that, I can keep him at bay, and even blackmail him if I want. That's right. That video is my "insurance"... Isn't that what they call it, Mr. Wright?
Pearl:
Why would you do something so wrong...?
Engarde:
Because I'm a grown-up, and I can. Good enough of an answer for you, little girl?
Motive for murder
Pearl:
Why!? Why would you kill Mr. Corrida...?
Engarde:
Because he was about to sling so much dung onto my beautiful public image. Scandals are a little annoying, aren't they?
Phoenix:
This is all because of that press conference, isn't it...?
Pearl:
If Mr. Corrida had been able to give it, then Mr. Engarde's secret would've...
Engarde:
Ah, well, that's what we call "taking advantage of the situation", you know? I had no interest in doing it, really, but bit by bit, it crept up on me. And then the situation just presented itself perfectly... "How beautiful," I thought.
Pearl:
And that's... That's how Mr. Corrida ended up dead...
Engarde:
Let me tell you something. I'm not like Adrian. I don't depend on anyone. People are simply things to be used. Used and thrown away. Put on a sweet, innocent face, and people will swallow anything you feed them. Adrian fell for it. The assassin too. Oh, and how can I forget. Even you fell for it, Mister Lawyer!

Pearl:
N...No! We can't do that...
Edgeworth:
That's right... He's holding Maya hostage...
Phoenix:
... What... What should I do...?
Edgeworth:
... That's not something I can answer for you.
Pearl:
M-Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Wright... Only you can decide where to go from here. One year ago... At that time, I didn't truly understand what a "prosecutor" was. And that is why... I had to leave the Prosecutor's Office. I felt that I couldn't stand in a court of law until I knew what a prosecutor really was. And now, Wright... It's your turn.
Phoenix:
My... Turn?
Edgeworth:
What is this thing called a "lawyer"? What can you do as one? You must find the answer... And you must find it on your own.
Talk
Matt Engarde
Phoenix:
I'm a lawyer... But to fight for someone who is clearly a killer... Matt Engarde... That man is really... Argh!
Edgeworth:
It doesn't matter who, every person deserves a proper defense and a fair trial. Isn't that the basis of our judicial system?
Phoenix:
"Proper defense"? But what exactly is that? Is it where a lawyer forcibly and blindly gets an acquittal through shouting and trickery?
Edgeworth:
...*sigh* Ironic that you of all people should say such a thing. Isn't that exactly how you have fought for your clients up until now?
Phoenix:
Uh... W-Well, that may be true, but... But that's... That's because I've believed my clients to be innocent from the bottom of my heart! But if I were to get Engarde an acquittal... That... That isn't a proper defense at all!
Maya's situation
Phoenix:
I became a lawyer because I thought... I thought I could save people who were suffering and in pain...
Pearl:
...
Phoenix:
But... When I look at this mess we're in... I can't even protect the person closest to me. Even if I win the case, I still lose in the end... I just don't know what to do!
Edgeworth:
... Wright. Would you get a hold of yourself? You have it all wrong.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
We aren't some sort of heroes. We're only human, you and I. You want to "save someone"? That's something easier said than done, wouldn't you say?
Pearl:
Th-That's...
Edgeworth:
You are a defense lawyer. You can't run away from that. You can only fight. That's all you can do.
Why fight? (appears after Matt Engarde and Maya's situation)
Leads to:
"People like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down."
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
(Now's not the time to talk about evidence...)
Phoenix:
People like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down. You fight to the very end, even when you know the truth is not with you. But I'm not like you. I can't fight for a false verdict -- for a man I clearly know to be guilty!
Edgeworth:
... Franziska... She fights for herself. The only thing she fights for is her perfect win record. That's all.
Phoenix:
And!? Isn't that the same as you!? Isn't that why you ran away a year ago? Because your precious win record was destroyed!? You are so petty!
Edgeworth:
... I see... Now I understand why you despise me so. However, you are mistaken.
Phoenix:
What do you...?
Edgeworth:
Thanks to you, when you sealed off my path to a perfect win record... I began to realize the error of my ways. I realized that things such as a perfect record were meaningless.
Pearl:
Eh!?
Phoenix:
I don't believe you. Are you saying that is why you left the Prosecutor's Office? But then, why? Why are you here now?
Edgeworth:
The answer to that... is something you will find out on your own. I have faith you will see it before the verdict is read tomorrow. But if you can't, then you will be powerless to change the ending of this story.
...*beep beep beep*...
Pearl:
M-Mr. Nick! The transceiver!
...*beep*...
???:
I'm sorry for what happened earlier. Well then, Mr. Attorney. Do you wager you can obtain an acquittal tomorrow?
Phoenix:
...
???:
My, my. What is the matter, Mr. Attorney? I don't sense your usual anger this time.
Phoenix:
...Tell me. Please. Why are you holding Maya hostage for Mr. Engarde's sake? Why are you... Why are you doing this for that cold-blooded killer!?
Edgeworth:
Wright...
???:
... Please don't misunderstand things. He is my client.
Phoenix:
Don't toy with me! A man who hires an assassin is just as much of a killer himself!
???:
... ...I believe you were asking me for a reason as to why I am doing what I am...
Phoenix:
...Y-Yeah.
???:
This is what I like to call my "aftercare".
Phoenix:
Wh-What the heck is "aftercare"?
???:
My name carries a certain amount of honor and dignity, Mr. Attorney. I take great care to insure that no suspicion falls upon my clients for my handiwork. That is what is called "client relations" and it is a part of an assassin's duty.
Phoenix:
An assassin's... "duty"...?
???:
We were unlucky this time and my client was arrested as a suspect. As a result, I did what I had to do to enlist your expert help, Mr. Attorney. And to ensure that you would do everything in your power to the very end.
Phoenix:
Wh-What is your name!?
???:
I believe I told you once before, however...
Phoenix:
You did... But...
???:
My name is... De Killer. Shelly de Killer.
Edgeworth:
Y-You're Shelly de Killer!?
de Killer:
Please keep in mind you do not have much space to maneuver with me. As a De Killer, I always finish what I set out to do. If you fail to keep up your end of the bargain...
Phoenix:
M-Maya!
de Killer:
It would be my duty as an assassin to see to it she receives a nice long nap.
Pearl:
Aaaaaaaaaaah! Noooooooooooo!
de Killer:
Now then, if you'll excuse me. If someone were to trace this signal back to me, it would be quite troublesome.
...Meow.
...*beep*...
Pearl:
Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaa!
Edgeworth:
I... I don't know what to say...
Phoenix:
...Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Hm?
Phoenix:
Did you hear that? At the end of that transmission...
...Meow.
Edgeworth:
Huh? Oh, that... It sounded like a cat.
Pearl:
...A cat?
Phoenix:
(It can't be... that cat... Can it...?)
Pearl:
What is it...?
Phoenix:
I think... I know where Shelly de Killer is holding Maya hostage! Edgeworth! Have all police units head for Engarde Mansion immediately!
Edgeworth:
...! Alright. You hurry over as well, then!
Phoenix:
Don't lose hope yet, Pearls! The fight has only just begun!
Pearl:
Y-Yeah!
Detention Center
(Clearing all "Talk" options of Engarde leads to:)
Phoenix:
(Now then, whose story do I want to hear?)
Matt Engarde
Jailer:
I'm really sorry, but... Matt Engarde is refusing to meet with you.
Phoenix:
...I see.
Phoenix:
(Well, I guess I don't really have anything left to talk to him about anyway...)
Pearl:
Shall we listen to what Ms. Andrews has to say...?
Hotel Lobby

Living Room

March 22
Engarde Mansion
Living Room
March 22Engarde MansionLiving Room
Phoenix:
Maya!
Pearl:
Please answer us! Mystic Mayaaaa!
Edgeworth:
We have this area completely surrounded. There is no way for him to escape. Assuming he's still in the area...
Phoenix:
I can't believe it... That butler... All this time, he was De Killer...
Edgeworth:
He and Engarde were working together all this time. I'm sure they had worked out a contingency plan ahead of time.
Examine
Fireplace
Phoenix:
This is the first time I've seen such a large fireplace.
Edgeworth:
I don't particularly care for large fireplaces. They remind me of my youth.
Phoenix:
(I wonder, if memory serves, if it's because of that rich aunt he had?) Don't tell me you're still stuck on that incident...?
Edgeworth:
Don't take this personally, but I really do not wish to remember anything from that time in my life.
Motorcycle
Edgeworth:
It seems that Engarde was quite famous, even as a motorcycle racer.
Phoenix:
Generally when a star like him tries to do something like that, they fail, but...
Edgeworth:
It seems Engarde is no ordinary man.
Lounge set
Edgeworth:
That Engarde... This is probably where he conducted business with De Killer.
Phoenix:
Yeah...
Edgeworth:
Shelly de Killer values his client relations more than anything else. So I'm sure he must meet with his clients in person to talk about any transactions.
Masks
Edgeworth:
It's Engarde's personal collection. I'd say it's a hobby of his to collect prop masks of shows related to his own.
Phoenix:
You seem to know all sorts of details about Matt Engarde... Almost too many details...
Edgeworth:
He's the defendant in this case. Of course I would know about him.
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah... I guess that makes sense...
Door on behind
Phoenix:
It looks like there's another room in the back.
Edgeworth:
Leave that to us. I'm sure the investigation team is already doing its job in there.
Door
Pearl:
There's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick.
Phoenix:
I bet it's for the cat to use.
Pearl:
Oh, you mean Shoe.
Bear figurine
Leads to:
"Oh, it's a figurine of a bear!"
(Examining bear figurine leads to:)
Pearl:
Oh, it's a figurine of a bear! But there are a lot of cuts in it for some reason...
Figurine added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
A bear...? Isn't that more of a thing for Mr. Corrida? Why would something like this be here...?
Edgeworth:
Wright, look down. There's a little pet door installed here.
Pearl:
Ah, I'm sure that's for Shoe...
Phoenix:
Do you think that this... came through that little door...?
Edgeworth:
Umph! This door... It's locked!
Phoenix:
Well, I'm pretty used to breaking doors down by now. Let's go, Edgeworth!
*SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!*
Phoenix:
Argh! There's no one here!
Edgeworth:
From the looks of this room, I would say this is Engarde's private lounge. ...Look at this, Wright!
Phoenix:
An antennae for sending and receiving radio signals and a VCR... Check inside the deck! If there's a tape, it would be an important piece of evidence! (If we're lucky, it'll have the moment the crime was committed recorded on it!)
Edgeworth:
... I'm sorry, but... The tape deck is empty. There's no tape to be found.
Pearl:
No...
Edgeworth:
But there's no mistake that someone used this to record something. It looks like someone took the tape we're looking for, and escaped with it...
Examine
TV
Phoenix:
A huge television and speakers loom largely here. I'm sure if Maya saw this, she'd say,
Maya:
"I would die a happy Samurai fan if I could see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this!"
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's what she'd say... ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about Maya, all things considered...
Antenna
Phoenix:
It's a VCR and an antennae. The footage that the spy camera took at the scene of the crime... was beamed here and recorded on tape.
Pearl:
If only we had that tape, it would have been really helpful...
Computer
Phoenix:
It's Engarde's computer. Maya... Why couldn't you have used this to get help?
Pearl:
M-Mr. Nick! Where's... Where's the power switch!?
Phoenix:
... (Oh, I get it... So that's what happened. She couldn't find the power switch...)
Table
Phoenix:
It's a very small table. I bet we could barely squeeze 3 Pearls on there.
Pearl:
But I wouldn't sit on a table to begin with, Mr. Nick...
Sofa
Phoenix:
What a spacious sofa. I bet 10 Pearls would fit on here.
Pearl:
Um, I don't think 10 of me would fit, Mr. Nick...
Video tapes
Phoenix:
I can't read all the labels, but this is a very large collection of video tapes. Looks like Engarde taped all of his own shows...
Door
Pearl:
There's a little door for Shoe in this big door.
Phoenix:
I'm sure Maya used this door to shove this out there... I'm sure it was her! (Every time you give me some piece of evidence, it's always the most crucial piece. This time too, I'm sure...)
Move
Wine Cellar
Leads to:
"..."
Phoenix:
... (We've searched all over, but it looks like he got away...)
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry. It looks like he slipped out of our grasp this time.
Phoenix:
And now... we've lost our only lead.
Edgeworth:
Don't give up yet. That little girl is looking to you to be her pillar.
Pearl:
...
Phoenix:
...Yeah, you're right.
Edgeworth:
We're close, I can tell. We've already set up checkpoints along every route leading out of this district. Leave the rest to us.
Phoenix:
(Maya...)
Examine
Bottles
Pearl:
Wow... I've never seen so many bottles all in one place before.
Phoenix:
Well, I guess when you're a star, you have so much money you can buy anything you want.
Boxes
Phoenix:
The light doesn't filter in all the way, so it's hard to see. It looks like there are crates and cardboard boxes tied up with wire here.
Door
Pearl:
It's a pretty heavy door, isn't it? I can't open it by myself. Please don't shut me in here by accident, OK Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
(If I were locked in a place like this... I'd be plenty scared too. Trust me.)
Photo frame
Leads to:
"This looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax..."
Phoenix:
This looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax... ("With love... Celeste")
Pearl:
Ms. Inpax? You mean...?
Phoenix:
Yes, Mr. Corrida's former manager.
Pearl:
Why would a picture of Ms. Inpax be here in Mr. Engarde's mansion?
Phoenix:
(And why does it say, "With love"...? Hmm, this might be a clue...)
Celeste's Photo added to the Court Record.
Pearl:
Ah!
Phoenix:
What's wrong, Pearls?
Pearl:
P-Please let me see that picture frame!
Phoenix:
(Huh? What's so special about the frame?)
Pearl:
On the back... There's something written on the back of the frame! ..."Maya" It's Mystic Maya! She left us a message!
Phoenix:
Wh-What!?
Maya:
I thought you'd come. I knew you would. Now listen up! You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!? If you get that creepy slimebag a not guilty, I'll never forgive you, ever! I'm fine, so you don't need to worry. ...There's so much I want to write, but I don't think I have a lot of time left. Pearly, you're there too, right? Make sure you help Nick, OK? Someone's gotta watch out for the helpless lunk. ... Um... That's it for now, Nick. I guess I'll talk to you guys later.
Pearl:
...That's... I... Nooooooooo! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa... *sob*
Edgeworth:
Wright!
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
What's wrong? Why the blank stare?
Phoenix:
Oh, um, nothing.
Edgeworth:
We've searched the house, and this is the last room. It looks like he eluded us.
Phoenix:
...Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Yes?
Phoenix:
As far as clues go, I think this is about all I'm going to get.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
But I'm still short one last thing...
Edgeworth:
And what is that?
Phoenix:
(Ms. Andrews' Psyche-Lock... If I could just find out what secret she's holding... Then I think I stand a chance in court tomorrow... To blow this case wide open and expose the truth.)
Edgeworth:
I think I know what you're thinking. I'll contact the detention center.
Phoenix:
Um... Thanks, Edgeworth. Well, let's go Pearls. It's time to open that last lock.
March 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Andrews:
Good evening, Mr. Wright. ... What's wrong? You look ill...
Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews. I have come to remove your Psyche-Lock.
Andrews:

Andrews:
Fine, go ahead. Try to break me, if you can.

Take that!
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
-- Why Frame Him? --
Phoenix:
Can you please tell me why you framed Mr. Engarde for the murder?
Andrews:
I've already told you countless times. It's because I thought Matt was the killer.
Phoenix:
(No, that's not it! I know you have a personal reason to dislike Mr. Engarde.) Ms. Andrews. You may think I didn't hear it, but I know you said something earlier. You said, "Revenge."
Andrews:
So you are saying I was taking my revenge out on Matt, and that's why? Wh-What an absurd idea. I... I don't have anything I want to take revenge for.
Phoenix:
(Ms. Andrews... A woman who lives by being dependant on another person...) (There is something or someone in her past that would make her take revenge...)
Present Suicide Report or Celeste Inpax profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"C-Celeste..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Andrews:
Are you trying to help or hurt Matt with what you're doing...?
Phoenix:
What? What am I doing?
Andrews:
This random, haphazard throwing out of evidence you're so fond of doing.
Phoenix:
Th-That's not what I was trying to do at all!
Andrews:
Then refrain from doing it anymore.
Phoenix:
(I guess I screwed up big again...)
Leads back to:
"So you are saying I was taking my revenge out on Matt, and that's why?"
Andrews:
C-Celeste...
Phoenix:
There is only one catalyst that could cause such strong feelings, and even revenge. And that is Ms. Inpax's suicide.
Andrews:
Wh-What are you trying to say? Celeste was Juan's manager.
Phoenix:
...
Andrews:
On top of that, the one who hid her suicide note was also Juan. What does all this have to do with Matt?
Phoenix:
You're right. You haven't mentioned him... Yet. But for you to hate Mr. Engarde... It would mean that he must have had some relation to Ms. Inpax and her suicide.
Andrews:
Can you explain to me this "relation" between Celeste and Matt!?
Present Celeste's Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Andrews:
That's it?
Phoenix:
Yes...
Andrews:
And what sort of relation is this supposed to explain?
Phoenix:
W-Well, Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde's...
Andrews:
Before you start, Mr. Wright, perhaps I should first request to see proof that your brain is wired correctly.
Phoenix:
(Argh. I can't afford to mess up something as big as this! I need evidence that clearly shows a connection between Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde. If I can find that, I can finally get the real story!)
Andrews:
I wonder if you'd like to try again, Mr. Wright?
Leads back to:
"Can you explain to me this "relation" between Celeste and Matt!?"
Phoenix:
This... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct? She looks younger than when she passed away though.
Andrews:
...W...
Phoenix:
"With love... Celeste". This is Ms. Inpax's handwriting, isn't it?
Andrews:
... Where did you find this...? No, that's alright. It was a rhetorical question...
Phoenix:
Yeah, it is. I found this at Mr. Engarde's mansion.
Andrews:
... ...And after all this time... My last remaining secret has been revealed...

Talk
Why frame him?
Andrews:
Celeste... She was supposed to get married to Juan.
Phoenix:
Yes... But I heard that it didn't work out.
Pearl:
Because Mr. Corrida didn't want to get married to her anymore, right...?
Andrews:
Yes... Because of Matt.
Pearl:
B-Because of Mr. Engarde? What do you mean?
Phoenix:
(I think I can see where this is going.)
Andrews:
Celeste... She was Matt's manager a long time ago. She was the happiest woman in the world at that time. I was working part-time back then, and I often saw the two of them together.
Phoenix:
So that's why... "With love... Celeste" is written on the frame of that picture.
Pearl:
They were a couple, weren't they?
Andrews:
It wasn't anything as splendid as that. Celeste was being used; toyed with until she was... thrown away.
Pearl:
That's so horrible...
Andrews:
Matt's entire image is built around how nice and wonderful of a man he is. A scandal would have destroyed that. Which is why Celeste, in her kindness, moved over to Worldwide Studios. And that is where she met Juan. She seemed really happy with him; even happier than when she was with Matt. Celeste and Juan were such a good match that they were even planning to get married. And then it was suddenly called off. On the night Juan called their marriage off, Celeste... She killed herself. And that's why I framed Matt. It was revenge for Celeste and for myself.
Revenge (appears after Why frame him?)
Leads to:
"I'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right?"
Andrews:
I'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right? Matt "confessed" to Juan... about his relationship with Celeste.
Phoenix:
I see... So that's what happened.
Pearl:
But... Then why did Mr. Corrida have to call off the wedding!? I don't understand at all...
Andrews:
It was probably because of his worthless male pride. Juan and Matt were always fierce rivals. Matt waited for the wedding announcement and then unleashed the truth on Juan. He was aiming for when it would hurt Juan the most.
Pearl:
Poor Ms. Inpax!
Andrews:
...That wasn't the end of it. That day, I'm almost certain that Celeste left a suicide note behind. And in that note, she left a detailed account of Matt's various misdeeds, and... So that she would never again be hurt by Matt, she chose... to die. Then, when Juan discovered her body, he hid her note.
Pearl:
B-But why would he do that!?
Andrews:
It's simple. Juan realized that note was a powerful weapon against Matt. And it would be especially damaging to his "refreshing like a spring breeze" image. In any case... With his pride hurt, Juan sought revenge.
Phoenix:
Revenge... There's that word again.
Andrews:
Juan wanted to publicly disclose the contents of that suicide note. At a time that would cause Matt the most damage, of course.
Phoenix:
And that was at the press conference after the stage show...
Andrews:
I know all about it, because I heard it all from Juan. It was so I could find out about all this that I drew close to Juan to begin with. They're quite a pair of hideous monsters, aren't they? Even Celeste's death was something for them to use in their game. That night, when I found Juan's body, it was only natural that I thought the murderer was Matt. Those two were always spying on one another, after all. As for me, I was frantically searching for Celeste's suicide note. I wanted to destroy it before it ever went public. I was going to burn it. I had even brought a lighter. But... I couldn't find the suicide note... And that's when revenge crossed my mind. Yes, I was going to bring to them my own kind of cruel revenge. Celeste was killed by those two monsters. So when I stabbed Juan's body with that knife... I didn't feel a single shred of guilt.
Pearl:
...!
Andrews:
... And that's all I have to say.
Phoenix:
...
Andrews:
Well, Mr. Wright? Even knowing all this, are you still going to help that... "man"?
Phoenix:
... I... I'm a lawyer...
Andrews:
I see. What a foul profession.
Phoenix:
... Thank you very much for your time and for talking with me.
Andrews:
It was no big deal. I couldn't sleep anyway.
Phoenix:
(I can't sleep either... Not with Maya's situation... or with what I know now...)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:

Exit Magatama session
Phoenix:

Too many errors during Magatama session
...Mr. Nick......If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter......Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...
Phoenix:
