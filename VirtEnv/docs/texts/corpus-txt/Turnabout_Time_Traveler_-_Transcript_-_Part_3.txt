Wright Anything Agency
Athena:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! So the whole time traveling thing... ...was just a ruse put on by the guests at the reception?
Phoenix:
Looks like it. I knew there had to be some kind of trick to it.
Athena:
Wow. Two wedding receptions! Can you imagine? I wonder how much THAT must've cost them!
Phoenix:
I-I have no idea... But if you have to ask, you're not rich enough to want to know... Still, if you've got the money, it's a pretty good way to cover things up, if you ask me.
Athena:
You got that right...! I'm sure I would've been completely fooled.
Maya:
Hi! I'm back!
Phoenix:
Hey, Maya. Are you all set to go?
Maya:
Yup! Ready when you are! So! What should we start with?
Phoenix:
Hmm... Let's start with reviewing what we learned at the trial. What Ellen thought was time travel was really just a performance put on by the Sprockets. But other than that, it seems that what Ellen told us was actually all true.
Maya:
So what really matters right now is... ...the identity of the mystery person Ellen said she saw while she was being attacked!
Athena:
So, who IS this mystery person?
Phoenix:
That's the million-dollar question, I'm afraid. But if we want to clear Ellen of any suspicion, then figuring out who they are is key.
Athena:
I think I'll take "Toilets" for $200, instead, Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
Well, at least there were only so many people on that airship that night. And we know who the mastermind of the whole cover-up plot was, too, so that's good.
Athena:
You mean the groom, Sorin Sprocket, right?
Phoenix:
Exactly. He might know something that could help us out.
???:
So then, what am I doing here?
Larry:
I'm a very busy man, you know.
Phoenix:
Well, all of the other people involved are Sorin's family members. So I thought I'd better start by interviewing you. (Even if I probably shouldn't trust a word out of your mouth...)
Larry:
Oh, man... I have a really tight schedule, but... aw heck, what are friends for, right? Okay, pal! Go ahead, ask me anything!
Phoenix:
(Um, you DO remember it was you who came to me for help in the first place, right...?)
Talk
The incident
Phoenix:
I want to go over exactly WHAT happened WHEN before I step outside this office again. Since you were there, Larry, do you think you could help me get it all straight in my head?
Larry:
*sigh* If I gotta...
Phoenix:
Okay. So, the first reception was held at 7 PM on the day of the incident. That's the one you tried to crash, right?
Larry:
Huh? Oh, yeah, that's right. And then they locked me up in a cabin! It was awful, I tell you!
Phoenix:
(Too bad we're not here to focus on you, Larry.) And then the incident occurred after this first reception, at around 10 PM. Ellen was attacked in the reception hall by Gloomsbury. He forced her out onto the vista deck and was just about to kill her... 
Larry:
But Elly fought back, and ended up killing ol' Gloomsbury instead. To cover it up, the family quickly threw together a second reception. That's what Edgey is claiming, anyway. But I know my Elly didn't do it!
Phoenix:
The key point here is the mystery person Ellen said she saw strike Gloomsbury... ...just before she passed out. Did you see anybody suspicious skulking around that day?
Larry:
Nope. Not a soul! Because I was locked up in a cabin at the time!
Phoenix:
But you managed to escape, and sneak back into the reception hall. That's when you switched the lantern in the event hall with the lantern in the hold, right? Did you see anybody then?
Larry:
Nope. The place was completely deserted. I guess 'cause that Pierce butler guy had everybody gathered together somewhere.
Phoenix:
That makes sense. He must've been going over the cover-up plan with them. (So, clearly, the murder had already happened by the time Larry got out...) They must've gotten everything ready fast, and had the second reception soon after that.
Larry:
Then, after that second reception, Elly went to clean up the reception hall... ...and, as luck would have it, that's when she found the body in the lantern I'd brought up. I tried to do something nice for Elly out of the goodness of my heart, and THIS happened!
Phoenix:
Hmm... We still don't know exactly what happened during the actual murder itself. We'll just have to look into it, along with the identity of that mystery person...
The cabin
Leads to:
"So while the murder was taking place, you were locked up in a cabin."
Phoenix:
So while the murder was taking place, you were locked up in a cabin. Did you see anything unusual while you were in there?
Larry:
In the cabin? Let's see... Well... there was that pterodactyl flying through the sky! That's pretty unusual!
Phoenix:
Oh, right. That drawing of that "pterodactyl" you "saw"...
Larry:
What's with all the air quotes?! I really did see it! I swear!
Phoenix:
But, Larry, the time travel thing never actually happened. Which means you couldn't have seen a real pterodactyl flying through the sky!
Larry:
O-Oh... Are you doubting the eye of a super-popular picture book author?!
Phoenix:
No, I'm sure you saw something else, and mistook that for a flying reptile.
Larry:
Niiiiiick! You're making me doubt my own eyes! Now I'm not even sure WHAT I saw!
Larry's Drawing updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Either way, you have no idea what actually happened at the real scene of the murder?
Larry:
That's right! And I can say that with every confidence! Oh, wow. Would ya look at the time? I'd better go. I have a book signing to get to.
Phoenix:
A book signing? Whose book?
Larry:
Whose do you think?! It's mine, of course! It's a Laurice Deauxnim book signing!
Phoenix:
I bet you went around and begged a bunch of bookstores to let you do one. 
Larry:
O-Of course not! Th-They're the ones coming around to beg ME!
Phoenix:
(Looks like I guessed right...)
Larry:
A-Anyway, I have to go! I'll send you ten copies of my new book that just got released the other day, all right?!
Phoenix:
T-Ten? That's very generous of you...
Larry:
What are you talking about? I'm gonna send you the bill, too, of course. Just put 'em down as office expenses or something. Well, see ya!
Phoenix:
W-Wait, Larry! We don't need... ...Argh. He's gone.
Athena:
I'll take a copy, Boss! Oh, and make sure it's signed!
Phoenix:
Oh, boy... (Trucy's not gonna like this "office expense.")
Maya:
There goes our first lead. What do you want to tackle next, Nick?
Phoenix:
Right, we should really hit the streets now, huh? How about we go see Ellen?
Athena:
Sounds good, Boss! I bet I can cheer her up!
Phoenix:
I thought you were going to help Trucy with her magic show again today, Athena? Weren't you supposed to go meet her right about now? Trucy said she was going to practice her new trick on you, if I recall.
Athena:
"On me"...?! Really?
Phoenix:
Trucy's show is an important source of income for our agency, you know. You can leave the case to us, so you go ahead and run along, now.
Athena:
B-But, Boss...! 
Phoenix:
Off you go, Athena!
Athena:
Nooooo... I don't wanna dieeeee...
Phoenix:
We'd better get going, too, Maya.
Maya:
Okay!
Talk
Any ideas?
Maya:
............
Phoenix:
Why the long face, Maya?
Maya:
I can't believe time travel isn't real after all...
Phoenix:
I see...
Maya:
I thought I'd get to go back in time and see real dinosaurs and ninjas and stuff!
Phoenix:
Yeah... Too bad, huh? (I couldn't be more relieved, personally.)
What to do
Phoenix:
So, what should we do?
Maya:
Oh, I don't know... I mean, shouldn't we just keep investigating stuff or something?
Phoenix:
(She's really lost that spark... ...ever since I proved that time traveling wasn't real in court today...)
September 22
Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Ellen:
Oooooh... My poor, sweet Sorin...! I wonder how he's getting along without me...
Phoenix:
Hello, Ellen.
Ellen:
Oh, Mr. Wright! What's going to happen with the trial, do you think?
Phoenix:
Well, first and foremost... ...we have to hurry up and find this mystery person you saw just before you passed out.
Ellen:
Do you think that person could be the real killer?
Phoenix:
It's quite possible. And if we can prove that, we can clear you of all charges. Actually, would you happen to know where Sorin is right now?
Ellen:
He's usually busy with meetings all afternoon, but he should be home by evening.
Phoenix:
I think I'd better go have a chat with him later, then. (Why am I being treated to a view of someone's underwear...?)
Ellen:
Mr. Wright! Don't tell me... ...you suspect my sweet Sorin?!
Phoenix:
Well, he is the one who masterminded the second reception after the "time skip"... ...so I thought he might be able to tell us something.
Ellen:
How COULD you, Mr. Wright?! You can't possibly think--! My Sorin would NEVER kill anyone!
Phoenix:
A-All right, all right! Just calm down!
Ellen:
NO, not if you're accusing my Sorin!
Phoenix:
Please! I'm not accusing anybody! So please put the pan and ladle down, all right?
Ellen:
Really...?
Phoenix:
C-Cross my heart. So, for now, would you mind if I ask you a few more things about the case? (I'd better be careful not to provoke her...)
Talk
Sorin
Phoenix:
Could you tell me about Sorin?
Ellen:
There's nothing to tell! He's squeaky clean!
Phoenix:
A-All right, okay! (Maybe I should avoid the topic of Sorin right now.) L-Let's talk about something else, then.
Ellen:
Fine, but you won't hear a peep out of me about Sorin!
Phoenix:
(Talk about pulling teeth...)
Pierce Nichody
Phoenix:
Could you tell me about Pierce Nichody, then?
Ellen:
Pierce... He came to Sprocket Manor about a year ago. As the family butler, he's now in charge of everything in the household.
Phoenix:
Only a year ago? Did he have some kind of special connection with the family?
Ellen:
I'm just a maid, so I'm not privy to such things, I'm afraid.
Phoenix:
(It might've been Sorin's order, but Pierce is the one who coordinated the whole thing. He's the one who really orchestrated the grand "time travel" farce. He must have quite a bit of authority in that family...) But, no matter how good he is at his job... ...how could anybody gain that much influence in a single year?
Ellen:
I really don't know... I mean, he IS an excellent butler. Wouldn't that explain it?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Is it really as simple as that?)
Time travel
Phoenix:
What you thought was time travel was really just a cover-up carried out by your in-laws. Pierce said Sorin was the one who ordered the whole thing.
Ellen:
I still can't believe it. Even if the second reception was fake... ...Sorin would never use time travel for something like that! He's very serious about his time machine research, you know!
Phoenix:
I heard there's a reason he's researching time machines, actually... ...Something about "something he wishes he could change"... But isn't the whole idea of traveling back in time itself a little... fantastic?
Ellen:
I don't think so! After all, Sorin said real time travelers do exist!
Phoenix:
Really, now? You think he knows someone who actually traveled through time?
Ellen:
That's right. I haven't seen it personally, but Sorin said as much... ...so I believe it.
Phoenix:
(Somebody who actually traveled through time, huh? It's pretty hard to believe...)
Phoenix:
Thank you, Ellen.
Ellen:
You're going out to do your investigation now, aren't you?
Phoenix:
Yes, that's right.
Ellen:
Please make sure you don't cause Sorin any trouble, okay?
Phoenix:
I'm afraid... I can't promise you that.
Ellen:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Please! Whatever you do! Please don't upset my poor Sorin any further! I'm begging you!
Phoenix:
I-I'll do my best to not cause him any unnecessary trouble.
Ellen:
Ooh, I couldn't bear it if Sorin ever came under suspicion! I'd rather be found guilty myseeeeeeeelf! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Phoenix:
Yikes! Ellen, please! Don't work yourself up like this! You don't want Sorin to worry, do you?
Ellen:
N-No. You're right...
Phoenix:
(And the flood waters recede once more...)
Maya:
So what do we do now, Nick?
Phoenix:
Well, Ellen said Sorin is usually in meetings until the evening, so... ...let's save our house call until then. Why don't we go to the mooring dock and figure out our next move from there?
Maya:
Roger, Nick!
September 22
Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock
Phoenix:
So, where should we start?
Maya:
Hmm... Let's see. Are there any places we haven't examined yet? We already investigated the reception hall, and Sprocket Manor...
Phoenix:
...I know! We haven't looked at the vista deck or the hold yet!
Maya:
Hey, you're right! We've still got some pretty important places left to examine, don't we! The vista deck is the actual scene of the murder, right?
Phoenix:
And the lantern with the body in it was stored in the hold. I think there's a good chance we'll find some important clues in those locations.
Maya:
Do we know how to get to the hold?
Phoenix:
Good question. I think it was labeled in that diagram of the airship in this pamphlet. 
Maya:
There it is!
Phoenix:
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go!
Examine
Tower
Maya:
So that one little tower is all that's keeping the airship from being blown away?
Phoenix:
Apparently. It must be sturdier than it looks.
Maya:
You know what it reminds me of? A single mom raising three kids while holding down a full-time job!
Phoenix:
S-Sure... (Where did that analogy even come from...?)
Bench
Phoenix:
A strong wind blew this bench straight through the air, apparently.
Maya:
It looks like they fixed the sign, but left the bench right where it landed. I wonder why.
Phoenix:
Maybe the repair guy just hasn't gotten around to it yet.
September 22
Flying Chapel - Hold
Phoenix:
So this is the hold... (This is where Pierce orchestrated the whole cover-up operation... We'd better go over this place with a fine-tooth comb.)
Maya:
Hey, Nick...? Weren't we supposed to need a key card to get in here?
Phoenix:
Huh, you're right. I wonder why it was unlocked?
???:
How's it going, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Ema! What are you doing here?
Ema:
Just a little independent investigating, for my own sake. Gotta keep the mind sharp!
Phoenix:
(Ah, so the door's security system was turned off for the police investigation.) We'd like to investigate the hold ourselves. Would that be all right?
Ema:
Yeah, sure. The police just finished their examination anyway.
Phoenix:
Thanks. We'll just take a quick look around, then.
Ema:
Oh, right! You should know that the floor doubles as a huge lift. You can use that lever way back there to raise it up to the vista deck. The police inspected it already, but didn't find anything of particular interest, it seems. If you do go up to the vista deck with the lift, be careful not to fall off!
Phoenix:
Got it. Thanks.
Ema:
That goes double for you, Maya!
Maya:
Yes, ma'am!
Phoenix:
Well, let's get this show on the road.
Examine
Engine
Phoenix:
So this is the airship's engine. It's pretty impressive.
Maya:
And it's all rhythmic, like a heartbeat! It's the literal heart of the Flying Chapel! Look at all those huge gears spinning around and around and around and around and... Ulp! I think I'm starting to get dizzy...
Phoenix:
Yeah... Me, too...
Glassware
Phoenix:
These must be the dishes and glasses they use for receptions. Very fancy. I bet we'd be in big trouble if we broke any of them.
Maya:
Ooh! I wanna see, Nick!
Phoenix:
You, young lady, need to stay far, far away from them.
Maya:
Nick! You think I'm going to break them, don't you?!
Phoenix:
Let's just say your rap sheet for breaking things doesn't help your case.
Flowers
Maya:
These are the flowers we saw in Larry's photo!
Phoenix:
The petals make them look like little gears. The perfect flower for the Sprocket family, huh? Maybe they were going to shower the couple with the petals?
Maya:
You mean, kind of like how people throw rice or confetti?
Phoenix:
Yeah, like that. Only, these were found at the scene of a murder instead...
Airplane
Maya:
Ooh, look, Nick! It's an airplane!
Phoenix:
I wonder if Sorin built that one, too.
Maya:
Hey, why don't we take it for a spin? Just a quick tour around the neighborhood!
Phoenix:
And who do you propose is going to pilot that wooden deathtrap?
Maya:
Me, of course! Who else? Don't worry. I've seen people fly airplanes on TV plenty of times.
Phoenix:
Um... I think I'll pass. (I've still got my whole life ahead of me!)
Bell
Phoenix:
What's that? A wedding bell?
Maya:
According to the pamphlet... ...it's used on the vista deck during wedding ceremonies to bless the newlyweds.
Phoenix:
I guess they disassemble and store it away here in the hold when it's not being used.
Cake
Maya:
Ooh, it's a cake, Nick! A cake! It's so big, they wouldn't miss one little piece, would they?
Phoenix:
If you're that in the mood for a mouthful of styrofoam, knock yourself out.
Maya:
You mean it's not real...? Well, it sure fooled me... I was so ready to have some that I'm really craving cake now... Come on, Nick! Let's go get some!
Phoenix:
Maybe after the trial is over...
Pegacow Lanterns
Phoenix:
So there are two male Pegabull lanterns in the reception hall. That must mean... ...that these two are female Pegacow lanterns.
Maya:
Larry got their sexes mixed up when he replaced the one in the reception hall, huh? Didn't he see the horns? The difference is pretty glaring, if you ask me.
Phoenix:
And yet he managed not to notice. That's what makes Larry Larry. (And Larry being Larry is why I've seen more than my fair share of trouble for a lifetime...)
Ema:
Oh, Mr. Wright...? You know that lantern the victim was found inside of in the reception hall...? I'm just about to go piece it back together so the police can examine it.
Phoenix:
Oh? Okay. We'll stop by for a look, too, once you're done fixing it.
Lever
Phoenix:
Oh, look. There's the lever to the lift Ema told us about.
Maya:
Let's try going up on it! I'll go flip the switch. Here goes nothing!
Phoenix:
Wait! I'm not even on it yet! H-Hey, Maya! Stop the lift!
Maya:
Whoops, sorry! I got a little carried away!
Phoenix:
Never mind that. Move over a little!
Maya:
O-Okay...
Phoenix:
Is that... blood?
Ema:
B-Blood? Let me see!
Phoenix:
Could it be Mr. Gloomsbury's blood?
Ema:
Well, this lift goes up to the vista deck where the murder took place, so... ...I think that's the most logical conclusion.
Phoenix:
(But I thought the victim was clubbed to death and that there wasn't much blood...? Something tells me I'd better take a picture of this...)
Lift Bloodstain added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I should ask Ema about it some more later.) Maya, can you bring the lift back down now?
Maya:
You got it! I'll go flip the switch again! There! Done!
Phoenix:
I want to find out some more about that bloodstain... But, for now, I guess we should go up to the vista deck... ...and take a look around the actual crime scene for ourselves.
Maya:
The view must be great from up there! I bet it'll be awesome!
Phoenix:
...You mean, it would be, if it wasn't the scene of a murder...
Maya:
Okay! To the vista deck we go! Make sure you actually get ON the lift this time, Nick!
Phoenix:
I know, I know.
Maya:
Okay, I'll just flip the switch again, and... awaaaay we go! Wow! Look at the gorgeous view!
Phoenix:
So this is where Ellen was attacked, and Mr. Gloomsbury was killed... Yeesh. One wrong step, and it's "kersplat!" on the ground below.
Maya:
Should we go investigate the stuff that's a little closer to the edge?
Phoenix:
Well, I don't see much of anything over there. The police investigation didn't turn up any clues either, so... Maybe we don't need to?
Maya:
Oh, I get it! You're SCARED, aren't you, Nick?
Phoenix:
O-Of course not! C'mon, let's go back down and finish checking out the hold!
Lever(subsequent times)
Phoenix:
It's the lever for the lift... What should we do?
Go up to the vista deck
Phoenix:
Let's go up to the vista deck again.
Maya:
Okey-dokey! Aaaand up we go!
Phoenix:
Ugh... Well, I guess there really isn't anything to see up here... Let's go back down to the hold.
Maya:
But we just got here! Let's enjoy the view a little more!
Phoenix:
Time's a-wasting! L-Let's go, Maya!
Maya:
Aww...
Check out the bloodstain
Phoenix:
Maya, could you operate the lift for me? I want to see that bloodstain again.
Maya:
You got it! I just have to stop it partway up, right? So, first I'll throw the switch... there! Then, I'll press stop!
Phoenix:
Yeah... That's quite a bit of blood, all right. It's dry, but it doesn't look all that old.
Maya:
Do you think it's from the murder?
Phoenix:
I think so, but I'd need more info to be sure. Could you bring the lift back down now?
Maya:
Aye-aye, sir!
Leave it alone
Phoenix:
We'd better just leave it alone.
Maya:
Awwwww! I wanted to throw the switch!
Phoenix:
Maybe later...
Candelabra
Phoenix:
Huh? It looks like there are some fingerprints on this candelabra.
Ema:
Yeah. I just got done dusting that. I was able to pull a set of left hand prints.
Phoenix:
Do you know whose prints they are?
Ema:
Yes. The prints belong to the victim, Dumas Gloomsbury.
Maya:
Nick! I just figured out something amazing!
Phoenix:
You did?
Maya:
Get this -- if the fingerprints on the candelabra were from his left hand... ...then Mister Doom-n'-Gloom must've been... left-handed! What do you think of that? Do I have the makings of a great detective, or what?
Phoenix:
(Oh, yes. Your deductive reasoning skills are nearly Encyclopedic...)
Ema:
Hey, you're pretty good, Maya! I looked into it myself, and sure enough, the victim really was left-handed.
Maya:
Really? I got it right? Awesome!
Phoenix:
Uh, good for you, Maya.
Maya:
"Good for you"? That's all you've got to say?
Phoenix:
I, uh, think you did a real great job, Maya. Way to go! (I guess one can never have too much info...)
Maya:
Now you're talking! Heh heh heh!
Phoenix:
But, come to think of it... ...this candelabra isn't in the photo Larry took of the hold, is it?
Maya:
That picture was taken when they were getting ready for the first reception, right? The candelabra must've been brought in here sometime after that, then.
Phoenix:
Hmm... It's still possible it has something to do with the incident, though. I'd better add it to the evidence file, just in case.
Candelabra added to the Court Record.
Ema:
Oh, by the way, Mr. Wright... You can have this fingerprint powder, if you like.
Phoenix:
You're giving this to us?
Ema:
Sure. I have four other sets.
Phoenix:
Th-Thanks... (I feel like there's something more to the candelabra, but I can't put my finger on it...)
Candelabra (subsequent times)
Maya:
I wonder where they sell candelabras like these...
Phoenix:
What, are you looking to buy some?
Maya:
I was thinking they'd be perfect for the altar candles in the Channeling Chamber at home. It might class up the place a little!
Phoenix:
I dunno... I can't really see them fitting in with the vibe of Kurain Village...
Talk
The incident
Phoenix:
Any progress with your investigation?
Ema:
Nothing conclusive yet, I'm afraid. Almost everybody was involved with the cover-up... ...so it's hard to know who or what to believe.
Phoenix:
I know what you mean.
Ema:
Unless you have some compelling evidence, I'm afraid it's going to be a tough trial for you.
Phoenix:
You're telling me... There isn't much time left, so I've just got to make do and see what I can turn up.
The candelabra
Phoenix:
Ema, can we check out this candelabra a little more?
Ema:
A little more? What do you -- Oops!
Phoenix:
Wh-What happened?!
Ema:
I almost dropped the candelabra, and the candles slipped off.
Phoenix:
Well, let's be careful with that. It might be important evidence.
Ema:
Wait a minute... 
Phoenix:
Now what?
Ema:
One of the pins that hold the candles is broken.
Phoenix:
What?
Ema:
There's definitely something fishy about this candelabra!
Phoenix:
There is? What makes you say that?
Ema:
Call it forensic investigator's intuition! We already dusted this for prints earlier... ...so let's test it with luminol this time!
Phoenix:
(Knowing Ema, she'd use every test she has at the same time if she could...)
Ema:
Just hang on. This will only take a second.
Phoenix:
(I hope this turns up a new lead somehow...) Well, Ema? Did you find anything?
Ema:
Take a look at this, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
What is all that blood doing on there?!
Candelabra updated in the Court Record.
Ema:
Maybe somebody got hurt while they were setting up for the reception? These pins are pretty sharp.
Phoenix:
But if one of the pins is broken... ...it means there was some force involved. Do you think maybe somebody got stabbed?
Ema:
B-But nobody reported anything like that...
Phoenix:
(That's quite a bit of blood. I wonder whose it is... If I have anything that might shed some light on that, I should probably show it to Ema...)
The bloodstain (before clearing "The candelabra" dialogue option)
Phoenix:
Ema, about this bloodstain...
Ema:
I'm thinking it's probably the victim's blood.
Phoenix:
But the victim was clubbed to death, right?
Ema:
Yeah, but he could've been bleeding from his nose, or maybe he spat it out. I won't really know for sure until I look into it some more.
Phoenix:
I see. (There's still something about it that bothers me, though...)
The bloodstain (after clearing "The candelabra" dialogue option)
Phoenix:
About this bloodstain...
Ema:
What about it?
Phoenix:
There's something about it that's been bothering me.
Ema:
Oh, yeah? What's that?
Phoenix:
Well, there's a huge bloodstain on the crime scene lift, and a bloodstained candelabra... Now, this is only a guess, but I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from...
The same source
Leads to:
"I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source."
Different sources
Phoenix:
I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from completely different sources.
Ema:
Yes, that's what I'm thinking, too. So, what about it?
Phoenix:
(Oh, hmm... Being in agreement won't lead us anywhere new... I need to find out more about these bloodstains somehow...) Sorry! That's not what I meant to say... 
Leads to:
"I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source."
Phoenix:
I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source.
Ema:
Hmm... I guess that IS a possibility.
Phoenix:
Can we compare the two bloodstains? Would that take a lot of time?
Ema:
Are you kidding? Don't underestimate the power of science! It'll be done in a jiffy! And the results are in! That didn't take long, now, did it? Hmm... It seems that the blood from the lift and candelabra are from the same person.
Lift Bloodstain updated in the Court Record.
Candelabra updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Well, the victim was clubbed to death, and there wasn't all that much blood...
Ema:
But if this isn't Mr. Gloomsbury's blood...
Phoenix:
Well, this is just a guess, but... ...what if Mr. Gloomsbury stabbed somebody with the candelabra pin? That would explain both the huge bloodstain on the lift and the blood on the candelabra.
Ema:
Oh, my goodness! If that's true... ...then that means there was somebody else present at the scene of the murder!
Phoenix:
It does, doesn't it? (This just might substantiate Ellen's statement about a third person!) Ema, could you have this blood analyzed?
Ema:
Sure thing!
Present
Lift bloodstain
Phoenix:
Ema, about this bloodstain... Doesn't something about it strike you as odd?
Ema:
What's so odd about the victim's blood?
Phoenix:
That's not exactly... There's just something about it that bothers me.
Ema:
Hmm... Now that you mention it... ...I can't say I necessarily disagree with you.
Phoenix:
(Maybe I should talk about this some more with her...)
Phoenix:
Hmm... A mysterious bloodstain on a candelabra with the victim's prints on it... This just might back up Ellen's memory of seeing a third person. Next up, the reception hall. It might be worth taking another look around in there.
Ema:
The reception hall? The forensics team is in there investigating right now.
Phoenix:
Oh, they are?
Maya:
Well, we don't have time to just sit around, so let's go check out something else!
Phoenix:
Good idea. We could go question some people. (Especially Sorin. I have quite a few questions for that guy.)
Maya:
Sounds good, Nick!
Ema:
Off to do some legwork, then?
Phoenix:
Yup. I thought we'd head to Sorin's house for starters.
Ema:
He was accompanying the police on their investigation here earlier, but... ...he's probably home by now.
Phoenix:
Great, thanks. Later, Ema.

Phoenix:

I was told I had guests...
Phoenix:
Thank you for seeing us, Sorin. We know you're busy. We'd like to ask you a few questions about the case, if you wouldn't mind.
Sorin:

Phoenix:
Um... Sorin?
Sorin:
You're Ellen's lawyer, right?
Phoenix:
Huh...? Y-Yes, that's right. (Don't tell me he doesn't remember me...?)
Sorin:
...Will Ellen be found guilty?
Phoenix:
We're doing everything we can to prevent that. That's why we're here, investigating. Will you please tell us what you know?

Hey, Nick! Better watch out, or you'll be cursed by the bouquet of woe.

The cover-up
Phoenix:
It was you who gave the order for that large-scale cover-up plan, isn't that right?
Sorin:
What "large-scale cover-up"...?
Maya:
Don't play dumb with us! You held two wedding receptions in order to try and cover up Mr. Gloomsbury's murder!
Phoenix:
Ellen thought that, through the power of the Time Keeper you built... ...she traveled back in time.
Sorin:
Ah... So that's why there were two receptions...
Phoenix:
(Wait, does he seriously not know why the reception was held twice? Looks like I'll have to delve deeper here...)
Time travel
Phoenix:
So, the cover-up scheme -- that fake trip through time... ...you're not the one who was behind it all? Pierce Nichody stated in court that you were the one who ordered it to be carried out.
Sorin:
Pierce said that...? I see. I leave him in charge of everything around me. So whatever he decides is, in essence, my decision, too.
Phoenix:
So I take it that you didn't know anything about the cover-up? 
Sorin:
......That's none of your business.
Phoenix:
But you were in two wedding receptions in a row! And still, you claim to know nothing?
Sorin:
... I have nothing more to say to you. Please leave.
Phoenix:
B-But, Sorin...! Ow!
Maya:
Oh, there's something written on this paper airplane! Let's see... "Go away!"
Phoenix:
It doesn't get clearer than that, huh... (He's looking especially uncooperative, but... ...maybe I can grab his attention somehow. There's still that one piece of evidence I don't know much about... It's worth a try...)

S-Sorin!
Maya:

Phoenix:
S-Somebody, help! Sorin's collapsed!
Maid:

Relative:
Get him to the hospital! Quickly, now!
Maya:
Poor Sorin... That must be one serious wound...
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Maya:
What is it, Nick?
Phoenix:
Well, when I showed him the candelabra, his whole demeanor changed... So I was just thinking that maybe his injury is...
Maya:
Huh? What's this?
Phoenix:
It's Sorin's notebook. He must've dropped it in the rush to get him to the hospital.
Maya:
Ooh, his notebook, huh...? I wonder what's written in it. Don't you? Come on! You know you wanna take a peek!
Phoenix:
Sorin's notebook... What to do, what to do...?
Take a peek
Leads to:
"I feel guilty, snooping around in somebody's personal notebook, but..."
Don't look
Phoenix:
I really don't think we should...
Maya:
But it might have some really, really, REALLY important information in it!
Phoenix:
Yes, that's quite possible, but still... (Well, I guess it IS for Ellen's sake, at the end of the day...)
Leads to:
"I feel guilty, snooping around in somebody's personal notebook, but..."
Phoenix:
I feel guilty, snooping around in somebody's personal notebook, but... ...maybe we SHOULD take a little look-see. Whoa! It's filled with big words written in tiny letters! I guess he uses this notebook to write down his invention ideas? ...Huh?
Maya:
What is it? Did you find something?
Phoenix:
Hmm... After March 8th of last year, the content of this notebook changes dramatically.
Maya:
Like how?
Phoenix:
Well... Ever since that date, Sorin's been writing down every detail of his life. As in EVERY.
Maya:
Maybe he decided to start keeping a diary?
Phoenix:
But this is way too detailed to be an ordinary diary.
Maya:
Hmm... Either he's really compulsive... ...or maybe just plain forgetful.
Phoenix:
(But is it really as simple as that...?) I feel like something happened on March 8th that made Sorin change.
Maya:
Well, why don't you let me take a look at that, and I'll tell you!
Phoenix:
H-Hey! Maya! Let go or we'll rip it!
Maya:
Eep! Now look what you did! You dropped it! You should've just let me take a look!
Phoenix:
(How is this MY fault...?)
Maya:
Oh, no! Nick...
Phoenix:
Ack! It fell into that pool of Sorin's blood! I can't read a thing on these two pages now...
Maya:
Uh-oh! You're gonna get it now!
Phoenix:
(Ugh... I guess it really is my fault after all...) Let's just put it away carefully for now. We can't let anything else happen to it, you hear?
Sorin's Notebook added to the Court Record.
Maya:
Huh? Hey look, there's something sticking out of the notebook. It looks like a newspaper article.
Phoenix:
Let's see... It's about the car accident Sorin's sister died in! It happened on... March 8th... That's the day Sorin's notebook completely changed... Oh, wow!
Maya:
Wh-What else does it say?!
Phoenix:
It says the driver at the time of the accident was... Dumas Gloomsbury. It says Sorin was in the car, too, and that he had sustained severe injuries. It's just like Pierce said. Sorin completely changed after the accident.
Newspaper Article added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
So Gloomsbury was driving the car when they got into that accident... That opens up the distinct possibility... 
Maya:
Of...?
Phoenix:
Of Sorin holding a grudge against Gloomsbury.
Maya:
You think Sorin could've...?
Phoenix:
I don't know. It's not like I have any proof... We should talk to Pierce about this when we return Sorin's notebook to him. ...Though he doesn't seem to be here right now. Maybe he's at the Flying Chapel.

Maya:
I strongly suggest you don't say anything like that in front of the Sprocket family!

But they're perfect! They can even hold the really big candles! And they look so cool, too!

Oh, it's the notebook you dropped!
Phoenix:
The notebook "I" dropped?! It only ended up where it did because you tried to snatch it out of my hands!

Phoenix:
Oh, I think we both know who's more to blame...

Maya:
This is about the car accident Sorin's sister died in... I bet she would've wanted to see her little brother get married...
Phoenix:
Yeah... But with the way things are, I don't think she'll be able to rest in peace. So we'll just have to figure out the truth somehow... For her sake, too.

Phoenix:
I sure hope Pierce is around here somewhere.
???:
Ah, Mr. Wright and Ms. Fey.
Phoenix:
Hello, Pierce. We were just looking for you.
Nichody:
I'm sorry for Master Sorin's sudden departure earlier. You have my sincerest apologies.
Phoenix:
It was totally understandable, really. But shouldn't you be at his side right now?
Nichody:
It's fine. The other servants are with him, and I am in constant contact with them. Do not forget to give him his pain medication, and be sure to keep him hydrated. Also, see to it that he is not up and about. He needs complete bed rest.
Phoenix:
(Is this what happens when you're too rich for normal, peasant phones...?)
Nichody:
I must return to Master Sorin now, but... ...did you want something of me?
Phoenix:
Actually, here's Sorin's notebook. He dropped it when he collapsed. (I hope Pierce doesn't notice the bloodstain!)
Nichody:
Oh. Thank you very much for this. I will see to it personally that Master Sorin gets it back.
Phoenix:
Thank you.

Nichody:

Phoenix:
Oh, of course not! Aha ha!
Nichody:
Because it is filled with numerous patent-worthy ideas, you see.
Phoenix:
Look, I know you're busy, but would you mind if I asked you a few questions about the case?
Nichody:
Well, as I said, I must be getting back to Master Sorin. So if you could make it quick, I would greatly appreciate it.
Phoenix:
All right. I'll make this as quick as I can.
Talk
The cover-up
Phoenix:
I'd like to ask you about the cover-up you tried to pull off, if you don't mind.
Nichody:
I told everything there is to tell in court already. Disposing of anything that may harm the Sprocket family's reputation... ...is simply a part of my job.
Phoenix:
(Sounds like a lovely job description...)
Nichody:
I have nothing more to say on the matter. I will say, I do not think it's wise to spend time on topics that have already been discussed.
Phoenix:
Right.
The accident
Phoenix:
Pierce, could you tell us more about this accident?
Nichody:
Where did you find that...? And did I not already tell you about that accident?
Phoenix:
You did, but you conveniently left out one crucial detail: The fact that Dumas Gloomsbury was driving the car at the time.
Nichody:
Oh? Did I not mention that? I suppose it simply did not come up then.
Phoenix:
If Mr. Gloomsbury caused the accident... ...why didn't the Sprocket family fire him? Wouldn't that usually be the natural consequence of such a huge mistake?
Nichody:
Please do not misunderstand. Gloomsbury stayed on with the family... ...on Master Sorin's request.
Phoenix:
(What...?)
Nichody:
That is the type of person Master Sorin is. Perhaps it was the influence of Miss Selena's kind nature. She was such a sweet person that even in her last moments, she thought of Master Sorin.
Phoenix:
(Not only did Sorin NOT hold a grudge against Gloomsbury, he insisted on keeping him on. Now I REALLY don't understand how that guy's mind works...)
Selena's last moments
Phoenix:
So you were present for Selena Sprocket's last moments...?
Nichody:
Yes, in my professional capacity... The accident happened on the way to a certain party.
Phoenix:
And what kind of a party was it?
Nichody:
It was Miss Selena's engagement party. Gloomsbury's injuries were minor, but Miss Selena's and Master Sorin's were critical. They were brought to the Sprocket family's regular hospital.
Phoenix:
(Wow... To have such a terrible thing happen on what was to be a day of celebration...)
Nichody:
Thanks to the surgeon in charge, Master Sorin pulled through. But Miss Selena... She...
Phoenix:
............
Nichody:
The last words Miss Selena said to me were...
"Please help Sorin."
Nichody:
Ever since then, I have attended Master Sorin and tried to help him in any way I can.
Phoenix:
I see... Selena's fiancé must have been devastated.
Nichody:
Indeed. The shock of losing Miss Selena was so great, he quit being a surgeon.
Phoenix:
He was a surgeon? Wait... So the surgeon who tried to save them both, was he...?
Nichody:
Yes, he was Miss Selena's fiancé.
Maya:
What a terrible tragedy...
Phoenix:
How awful... So where is her fiancé now?
Nichody:
...Good question. I wonder that sometimes myself.

Nichody:
That is why I do not want you to bring up the car accident again. I hope you understand.

NIchody:
Wh-What in the world would make you think that...?
Phoenix:
Oh, I've got my reasons. Mr. Gloomsbury's fingerprints were found on this candelabra's stem. Which leads me to believe that Mr. Gloomsbury stabbed Sorin with it.
Nichody:
You cannot possibly think Master Sorin is the one responsible for the murder.

Pierce's Secret

"Could you tell me about Sorin's injury?"

Could you tell me about Sorin's injury?
Nichody:
...Very well. This is what I heard directly from Master Sorin himself. As you surmised, Master Sorin was stabbed by Gloomsbury on the day of the murder. It happened after the first wedding reception. The happy couple was in the reception hall when, suddenly, Gloomsbury appeared... He attacked Miss Ellen and tried to take her away. Master Sorin went to stop him, and found himself in a struggle with Gloomsbury. That is when Master Sorin was stabbed with the candelabra, he said. Even though Master Sorin was badly injured, he went after Gloomsbury.
Phoenix:
So Sorin really was at the scene of the murder, wasn't he?
Nichody:
Yes, that is correct. However, by the time Master Sorin arrived at the scene... ...Gloomsbury had already been murdered.
Phoenix:
(So Pierce is saying that Sorin WAS at the crime scene... ...but that he didn't have anything to do with the murder itself. Hmm...) Even still, why did you try to keep such an important piece of information from me?!
Nichody:
I am very sorry. Master Sorin's injury and Gloomsbury's murder were not directly related... ...so I decided not to mention it, so as not to unnecessarily complicate the investigation. ...Now, then. I am sorry, but I am afraid I really must go now. Please excuse me.

That's true! One step forward is better than none! So, what next, Nick?

Maya:
True...
Phoenix:
It must be tough for the maids to have to work on a beautiful day like today.
Maid:
Oh, we don't mind.
Phoenix:
Whoa! I didn't think you could hear me way over here!
Maid:
We don't think of it as simply cleaning. It's more like we're wiping away all of the sadness stuck to this airship...
Phoenix:
(Wow. Talk about devoted...)
Sweetheart Table
Maya:
Hey! I think that tablecloth is new. They must've changed it since yesterday!
Phoenix:
Huh? How can you tell?
Maya:
Because the food stains that were there are now gone!
Phoenix:
(I should've known it's because it's food-related...)
Small table
Phoenix:
This is where the murder weapon, the Time Keeper, was displayed. I guess it's in police custody now. ...Huh? What's this? A key?
Maya:
Let's ask the maid about it.
Phoenix:
Good idea. She might be able to tell us something. Excuse me. Could I ask you a question?
Maid:
Oh, of course. What would you like to know?
Phoenix:
Do you know anything about this key?
Maid:
It's the key that starts up the Time Keeper.
Phoenix:
A startup key?
Maid:
That's right. Oh, the First Startup of Love ceremony was so beautiful! The bride and groom each had a symbol of their love, and when they put them together... Oh, how romantic it was!
Key of Love added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
First Startup of Love ceremony? What exactly did that entail?
Maid:
Oh, er... It's a ceremony in which the couple activated the Time Keeper together for the first time. I suppose it was kind of like a cake-cutting ceremony.
Phoenix:
And what are these "symbols of their love" you mentioned?
Maid:
Well... that's kind of an industry secret, so I can't really say. I'm sorry. I'd better be getting back to my work...
Phoenix:
(Looks like there's an order from above not to talk about it.) I guess we've checked out everything of interest in this area.
Repaired Lantern
Phoenix:
Here's the broken lantern, all patched up. (And I do mean "patched"...)
Maya:
Ema said this was some of her best work, so I know she put a lot of effort into it!
Phoenix:
It was pretty smashed up. It must've been a lot of work to piece it back together. (Well, she gets an A for effort, at any rate...) ... Huh? This wheel handle on the back has some blood on it! It looks like somebody gripped it with a bloody hand...
Maya:
Maybe the blood got there when the killer was putting ol' Doom-n'-Gloom's body inside? Do you see anything else worth noting?
Phoenix:
Well, there's another one of these lanterns over there... ...so it might be a good idea to really compare the two later.
Broken Lantern updated in the Court Record.
Repaired Lantern (subsequent times)
Maya:
Ema must've worked really hard on this.
Maid:
You mean that police lady? She was going at it like a jigsaw puzzle. All "Not this piece" here, "Not that piece" there...
Phoenix:
It was pretty busted up. I can just imagine what a hard time she had figuring it all out.
Maya:
She should've asked me to help! I would've loved to restore this thing with her!
Phoenix:
I think it's best to leave that kind of thing to the police. (Besides, who knows what kind of liberties Maya would've taken in the process...?)
Intact Lantern (after examining Repaired Lantern)
Phoenix:
This is the unbroken Pegabull lantern. And this is the one that Ema restored. I wouldn't say they look exactly the same... More that they're made up of the same parts.
Maya:
Wait a minute.
Phoenix:
What is it, Maya?
Maya:
I think there's something off about this Pegabull.
Phoenix:
Just about everything about it looks off to me...
Maya:
I'm not quite sure what it is, but some detail isn't quite right. Show me the restored lantern again.
Phoenix:
Hey, I know! It's this, right?
Maya:
What? Where?
Phoenix:
The thing about the restored lantern that's off is the...
Shape of the horns
Phoenix:
The shape of the horns is different, isn't it? How they're curved, and their size, and stuff?
Maya:
I don't know... The curve and size seem the same as the unbroken one to me.
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess you're right. They're pretty much identical, huh. In that case...
Leads back to:
"The thing about the restored lantern that's off is the..."
Angle of the wings
Phoenix:
I've got it! The angle of that wing is different. And it's attached all wrong!
Maya:
Well duh, Nick! I could've told you THAT! I mean there's something more subtle... Something that feels just slightly off. You know what I mean?
Phoenix:
(No, not really... Still, maybe it's...)
Leads back to:
"The thing about the restored lantern that's off is the..."
Color of the wheel handle
Leads to:
"Look. It's the wheel handle. It's a different color altogether."
Phoenix:
Look. It's the wheel handle. It's a different color altogether. Ema got the inside and outside wheel handles switched around.
Maya:
Oh, wow! You're right! And there's blood here on this handle -- as if somebody gripped it with a bloody hand.
Phoenix:
Right. Which means that the blood got on the handle from inside the lantern.
Broken Lantern updated in the Court Record.
Maya:
Do you think the blood got there when the killer was putting the body in the lantern?
Phoenix:
Hmm... It's really hard to say, at this point.
Talk
Any ideas?
Maya:
I don't know... I really wonder about that Pierce...
Phoenix:
Yeah, I know what you mean. He seems to have a lot of power over everybody and everything, doesn't he?
Maya:
Actually, what I was really wondering about is that shoulder mech of his... I mean, it's pretty amazing how many things that tiny little contraption can do. Ooh! What if that  mech is actually Pierce's true control center, like his brain?
Phoenix:
Um... Maya...?
Maya:
And what if, somewhere in Sprocket Manor, he has another shiny, golden body! And then, during emergencies, he can switch bodies and become Super Pierce Nichody!
Phoenix:
This is what I get for trying to have a serious conversation with a super geek...
What to do
Phoenix:
I bet all Ellen wants is to start her happy new life with Sorin.
Maya:
Yeah... I bet you're right...
Phoenix:
But do you think the truth will really set her free...?
Maya:
All you can do is do your job to the best of your ability! And if we can bring Ellen joy that way, all the better, right?!
Phoenix:
Maya...
Maya:
Either way, I think true happiness can only be found in the truth. ... Um, what are you looking at me like that for?
Phoenix:
I was just thinking about how wise that sounded. Looks like our little Maya is growing up!
Maya:
Would you knock it off? I'm trying to be serious here!
Phoenix:
S-Sorry! Sorry!
Present
Broken Lantern
Maya:
Ema did a pretty good job fixing this guy up. Is it just me, or does this Pegabull look happy to be whole again? Still...
Phoenix:
Still...?
Maya:
If Ema had let me do it, I could've made it ten times cooler! I would've made the wings bigger, given it three horns, and painted it all red. But that's not all!
Phoenix:
It would've ceased to be a Pegabull waaay before that point, Maya...
Phoenix:
Whew! Well, I think we've checked out everything relevant to this case.
???:
What are you two doing here?
Phoenix:
Wait, what are YOU doing here?! Sorin! Shouldn't you be resting in bed? You're injured!
Sorin:
How do you know about that?! ...Um, never mind. My notebook... Have you seen my notebook? I can't find it anywhere. My notebook... I need my notebook...
Phoenix:
(What's the matter with him?)
Sorin:
M-My notebook... I need... I have to have... I-I...
???:
Master Sorin!
Nichody:
Master Sorin! I told you to stay in bed!
Sorin:
M-My notebook...!
Nichody:
Here you go.
Sorin:
Yes... This is it...!
Phoenix:
(So Sorin gets emotionally unstable without that notebook of his...?)
Sorin:
...Phew.
Phoenix:
(Looks like he's calmed down now.) Sorin, do you mind if I talk to you for a minute?
Nichody:
I cannot allow you to do that. What if his wound were to open up again? He needs to rest.
Phoenix:
Arngh... I guess you're right...
Nichody:
Now, if you will excuse us. Master Sorin, let us retire.
Sorin:
... All right.
Maya:
There they go.
Phoenix:
Pierce is right. I guess he really isn't in any condition to be questioned. Well, let's go back to the agency and sort through what we've learned.

Talk
The incident
Phoenix:
Hey, Larry... I thought you had a book signing?
Larry:
Yeah, but I snuck off early. I was worried about how your investigation was going!
Phoenix:
Nobody came to get their book signed, huh?
Larry:
What kind of a thing is that to say?!
Phoenix:
Well, how many people showed up, then?
Larry:
Well, um... Fine! It was four people, if you gotta know! Including the employees...
Phoenix:
S-Sorry... I shouldn't have asked...
Larry:
Quit looking at me like I'm some pitiful piglet!
Phoenix:
Um, why don't you get back to your signing? Another two or three people could show up before the store closes...
Larry:
They already put away the book signing table and cleaned everything up! I... I don't have anywhere else to go.
Phoenix:
Gee, Larry... I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time.
Larry:
I told you to quit looking at me like that!
Ellen
Phoenix:
So, have you been to see Ellen?
Larry:
Nah. Edgey told me to stay away. He said things always get complicated whenever I'm around. Can you believe the guy?
Phoenix:
(Actually, I'd tell Larry the exact same thing if I were Edgeworth.)
Larry:
So... How's the investigation coming along?
Phoenix:
We've made some progress, but I don't feel like we've gotten to the heart of things yet.
Larry:
Come on, Nick! You gotta do better than that! Me and Elly's whole future is riding on you!
Phoenix:
I-I don't think I can take on the heavy responsibility of your future, Larry.
Larry:
Whaaat? First, Edgey, and now YOU, Nick? Why does everybody gotta be so mean to me?
Phoenix:
C'mon, Larry! I really don't have time to be standing around shooting the breeze! Why don't you just get back to your book signing, huh?
Larry:
W-Will you come with me, ol' buddy...?
Phoenix:
Not a chance!
Larry:
Ooooooooh...!
Phoenix:
(Enough is enough already, Larry...)
September 22
Wright Anything Agency
Phoenix:
We're back. Anybody here?
Athena:
Oh, hi, Boss!
Phoenix:
Athena? I thought you were with Trucy?
Athena:
Um... I guess you could say that I'm... I-I'm taking a short break! B-But enough about me! What about the investigation! Did you find out anything?
Phoenix:
Well, turns out that the third person Ellen says she saw at the crime scene... ...might have been Sorin Sprocket.
Athena:
What? Really? I always thought he seemed suspicious...
Phoenix:
Thing is, by the time Sorin got to the vista deck... ...the murder had already occurred, apparently.
Athena:
No way! I don't buy that! Not for a second! It's a cover-up! A cover-up, I tell you!
Phoenix:
That's... certainly a possibility. And, as a lawyer, it's certainly a possibility I have to pursue, but...
Athena:
But what? It's your job, right? So pursue the heck out of it! Just do it!
Phoenix:
Yeah, but... ...is that really what's best for Ellen?
Maya:
Sorin could be found guilty if the truth comes out tomorrow... But if we don't pursue this possibility, Ellen could be found guilty instead...
Athena:
Oh, man... Either way, it sure doesn't spell out "happily ever after" for the two of them... So what are you gonna do, Mr. Wright?!
Phoenix:
I can't let an innocent person get convicted. So I guess all I can really do... is pursue the truth. Even if it ends up devastating Ellen...
Athena:
What a tough call to make...
Maya:
S-Still, there's always a chance, right? Maybe something will come up during the trial that will save their marriage!
Phoenix:
I hope so. I really do... ......Well, Maya, let's go.
Maya:
Break the news to Ellen, you mean...?
Phoenix:
Yup.
Athena:
Mr. Wright! Please take me with you! I bet I could help you counsel Ellen through this piece of bad news!
Phoenix:
Athena... I appreciate the offer, but don't you have somewhere else to be?
Athena:
...Do I?
Trucy:
Athena! What are you doing here?! I've been looking all over for you! Come on, now! Let's get back to practicing!
Athena:
N-No... Wait...! My body can't take it anymore! B-Boss, you gotta help me!
Phoenix:
A lawyer always keeps their promises, Athena.
Athena:
B-But, Boooooss...!
Trucy:
If you bail on me one more time, Athena, I'm going to use a real blade on you!
Athena:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Phoenix:
(Sorry, Athena, but somebody's gotta do it... Better you than me, though... Hang in there, kiddo!) Come on, Maya. We'd better get going.
September 22
Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Phoenix:
Hello, Ellen.
Ellen:
How did your investigation go, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Before I answer that, I need to ask you something. Was Sorin with you when Mr. Gloomsbury attacked you in the reception hall?
Ellen:
I, uh...... I'm sorry I kept it from you. I was afraid that he'd come under suspicion if I told you. So I kept quiet about it. I'm really sorry...
Phoenix:
...I see. I thought it was probably something like that. Listen, Ellen... I'm afraid I had to make a very difficult decision based on what I found out...
Ellen:
...What kind of decision?
Phoenix:
This is... very hard for me to say, but... The mysterious person you saw at the scene of the crime... was most likely Sorin.
Ellen:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Phoenix:
In other words, in court tomorrow... ...I'm afraid I'll have to propose the possibility that Sorin is the true culprit.
Ellen:
No... Sorin is innocent... Nooo...
Phoenix:
But don't you see? If I don't try to pursue that line of thought, you'll be found guilty!
Ellen:
No... Nooooo... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Phoenix:
Please, Ellen! Calm down!
Ellen:
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Sorin just can't be found guilty! I'd much rather I be found guilty instead!
Maya:
Ellen! You can't let yourself think like that!
Ellen:
But..! But...! But...! Nooooooooooooooooooo!
Maya:
Marriage is for life, right? Do you really think you can run away from the truth and still be truly happy with him?
Ellen:
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! You're not married, so how can you possibly understand?! Sometimes you've just got to do whatever it takes to make things wooooork!
Maya:
But...! N-Nick, you talk to her...
Phoenix:
H-Hey! Don't just dump this all on me!
Ellen:
Mr. Wright! I'm innocent, and Sorin is, too! So, please...! Prove our innocence in coooourt!
Phoenix:
I... I'll certainly do everything in my power... (I just hope she doesn't lose control like this in court tomorrow...)
To be continued
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
Nothing particularly interesting here.
Area already examined
Phoenix:
I've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.
Exit Magatama session
Phoenix:
(I think I'd better take a step back and gather my thoughts a little more...)
