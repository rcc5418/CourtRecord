May 12, 9:34 AMHigh Court of Khura'in - Accused Lobby
Maya:
.........
Phoenix:
(Maya looks exhausted, but I can't blame her.)
Maya:
Nick, I was thinking about it all day yesterday... I never properly asked you to defend me, did I?
Phoenix:
It doesn't matter. I'm on this case till the bitter end.
Maya:
I know. That's why... I wanted to officially ask you for your help.
Phoenix:
You got it, Maya! Let's do this. We gotta wrap this up and get back home so you can make your dream show come true. "The Steel Samurai vs. The Plumed Punisher," right?
Maya:
You bet!
Rayfa:
You look as if you did not sleep last night, Barbed Head. It is written all over your face. How can you expect to put up a respectable defense like that?
Phoenix:
I-I'm all fired up, and raring to go! (I guess Maya's not the only one looking exhausted.)
Rayfa:
...........................
Phoenix:
(Hm? Rayfa doesn't seem in the best spirits herself.)
Rayfa:
Hmph. Go ahead, feign confidence now while you are still able. For I will see to it that your last rites are read to you this day!
Phoenix:
(Heh, guess it was just my imagination...)
Maya:
Ready, Nick?
Phoenix:
Okay, Maya, let's head on in!
May 12High Court of Khura'in
Day 2Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise
Judge:
Now then, if everyone is ready...
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Magistry.
Nahyuta:
The prosecution is ready. Let us begin without further delay.
Judge:
Oh, no prayers this time, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
I already offered my prayers for the latest victim during my visit to the crime scene. Being that the accused has already been found guilty of the first murder... ...let us hasten this trial, so we may put this dead lawyer walking out of his misery.
Judge:
I could not agree more. In yesterday's trial, the accused was already found guilty of murdering the high priest. And today she will be tried for the murder of his disciple, Puhray Zeh'lot. Now then, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, your opening statement, if you would.
Nahyuta:
...Certainly. The accused has now slain two of the most devout clergymen in Khura'inism. Even the lowest level of Hell -- the Hell of Tickling -- would not be punishment enough.
Judge:
*gulp* Th-Then... what t-terrible fate awaits her?
Nahyuta:
Bahlgilpo'kon Hell -- a realm of eternal agony. There she will suffer the endless punishment of ja'gar by the galuun of Puhlmo'ten. Furthermore, Guhljaama--
Judge:
E-Enough, enough! My blood runs cold at the mere thought that such a terrible place exists.
Phoenix:
(I was going to ask for a translation, but on second thought, ignorance is bliss.)
Judge:
N-Now then, please continue, minus the part about the terrible hell awaiting the accused.
Nahyuta:
As you wish... The victim of this heinous crime was the high priest's disciple, Puhray Zeh'lot. He had been training under the high priest while living at the priest's home.
Judge:
I had met him a number of times, and he seemed like an earnest young man. How tragic that he met such a terrible end.
Nahyuta:
The murder occurred at the Plaza of Devotion, during the Purification Rite. It was a bold crime carried out while the plaza was full of the faithful deep in prayer. The Warbaa'd Dagger was found impaled in the victim's upper back. The stabbing caused a spinal cord injury that killed him instantly.
Judge:
Ah, the Warbaa'd Dagger. Lady Kee'ra's weapon of choice.
Nahyuta:
We have already established that the accused's prints were on the weapon. Incredibly damning evidence in itself.
Maya:
N-No... I didn't do it!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Hold your tongue. Now, being that the accused, Maya Fey, is a serial killer... ...the prosecution believes that the death penalty is the only possible sentence.
Judge:
Would the defense care to respond?
Phoenix:
The accused is innocent, and nothing can convince me otherwise! After all, the crime scene was packed with worshippers. How could my client possibly have committed this murder without a single witness?
Nahyuta:
The accused's fingerprints on the murder weapon alone is enough to render a verdict. As such, I see no need to debate this any further.
Phoenix:
B-But...!
Judge:
Well, once Her Benevolence conducts her Séance, it will be clear for all to see.
Nahyuta:
............... Your Magistry, might I have a word?
Judge:
Hm? Is something the matter, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
It is about the Divination Séance...
Rayfa:
That's enough!
Judge:
Y-Your Benevolence!
Rayfa:
Stop right there, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.
Nahyuta:
...As you wish. Forgive me for overstepping my bounds.
Phoenix:
(What was that all about?)
Rayfa:
Barbed Head, have you made peace with your fate? For this time, the Divination Séance will bring you to your knees!
Phoenix:
I'm ready. And I accept your challenge. (The only problem is, I have no weapons at my disposal. Our only hope now is what we can glean from the Séance vision and Rayfa's Insights.)
Judge:
Very well. The Divination Séance if you please, Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
Yes, let us begin. ...Nayna! O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination Séance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!
Rayfa:
............
Phoenix:
............
Judge:
............
Phoenix: 
(I don't get it. Why wasn't there anything to see?)
Judge:
Y-Your Benevolence! What in the world...?
Rayfa:
Urgh... I was unable to evoke any sort of response. I called out the spirit's name many times... but to no avail!
Nahyuta:
Just as I thought...
Phoenix:
(Wait, what does he know that we don't?)
Nahyuta:
I had sought to confirm the contents of today's Divination Séance. After all, it is customary for the prosecutor to verify it beforehand.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it...)
Rayfa:
I must go perform a Divination Séance for Puhray Zeh'lot. It is our custom for the prosecution to review its contents before a trial begins.
Nahyuta:
And that is why I sought to stop Her Benevolence from performing it here. However, she insisted that it be done. She wished to try one more time here in the Hall of Justice.
Judge:
It would appear Her Benevolence is tired from her manifold duties.
Rayfa:
I am not anything of the sort! The victim's spirit will not answer my call, but I know not why! It is my sacred duty to convey the truth through the Divination Séance!
Phoenix:
(Rayfa...)
Judge:
What are we to do without a Divination Séance?
Nahyuta:
I suppose I shall have to deliver the last rites without them. The prosecution has already taken that into account when preparing for today. I am fully capable of proving the accused's guilt, with or without a Divination Séance.
Judge:
Ha ha ha ha ha! You never fail to impress, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.
Phoenix:
(This is bad... The Divination Séance was my one and only hope.) Your Magistry, Her Benevolence said she isn't tired! So, shouldn't we try to find out why the Divination Séance failed?
Rayfa:
!
Judge:
How curious, Mr. Wright. Why have you suddenly taken such a keen interest in the Divination Séance?
Rayfa:
Yes, explain yourself! The Divination Séance is for shedding light on an accused's crimes! It is the Holy Mother's hammer of wrath, that is ever poised to pound you into your grave! You should fear it, not plead for it!
Phoenix:
...I believe in my client. Plus, yesterday, somebody told me something that changed my mind: The Divination Séance was once thought of as just another piece of evidence. If we were to correctly interpret the visions through careful analysis... ...then they would lead us to the truth behind what really happened. And the truth will show that my client, Maya Fey, is innocent.
Maya:
The truth is, you don't have anything else to fall back on, huh, Nick?
Phoenix:
...Maya, please, you're not helping.
Rayfa:
How dare you?! The voice of a mitamah is to be feared, not utilized by vile lawyers such as you!
Nahyuta:
Séances exact a heavy toll upon the royal priestess. It would be best not to burden her any further. Or does the defense feel that it can pose no counterarguments without the Séance?
Phoenix:
N-No, of course not! (He saw right through me! I'll have to find a way to make the Divination Séance happen, or we're toast.)
Judge:
Well, since the Divination Séance is not possible at this time, I see no other choice. Let us proceed with the trial without the Séance, as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi suggested.
Nahyuta:
Thank you, Your Magistry.
Rayfa:
Why you...! I will not forget this, Barbed Head! This will NOT be the last you see of me!
Nahyuta:
Now then, I will now proceed by providing an outline of the case at hand.
Judge:
Very well. If the lead detective would please come to the stand, we may begin.
Ema:
........................ ...Sorry, Mr. Wright.
Nahyuta:
Detective Skye... I understand how you would wish to save the accused and the defense. They are your friends, after all. But you must let them go... and move on.
Ema:
B-But...!
Nahyuta:
There is only one way to save them now: By giving their souls the chance to burn away the taint of their sins in the infernal flames.
Ema:
Ooh... I... I... I can't do this!
Judge:
Ah! No eating in the sacred Hall of Justice!
Maya:
Ms. Skye!
Ema:
Y-Yes?!
Maya:
Don't worry about me and Nick. You just do your job. I'm sure Nick will figure something out... eventually!
Ema:
............... Right. Thanks, Ms. Fey.
Nahyuta:
How very brave for a criminal with a tainted soul. Very well, Detective Skye. Please proceed.
Ema:
Okay, I can do this... Let me start with an overview of this case.
Witness Testimony-- Overview of the Second Murder --
Ema:
The latest victim was Puhray Zeh'lot.
He had been training under the high priest, and living at his house for the past two years.
The high priest's widow Beh'leeb Inmee has identified the victim's body.
He may have been mistaken for a rebel and killed due to his connection to the high priest.
Judge:
I see... Well, that certainly makes sense. Would the defense care to respond?
Phoenix:
(I didn't spot any inconsistencies in her testimony so far. And I don't have any evidence in my arsenal. What am I going to do now?)
Maya:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
What is it, Maya?
Maya:
I was just wondering about how much the police actually looked into Acolyte Zeh'lot. Because it just might prove to be the key as to why the Divination Séance failed.
Phoenix:
What are you getting at?
Maya:
Umm, well... It's just a hunch.
Phoenix:
(Wait a second. During my investigation... ...Rayfa told me about how the Divination Séance works. If I could figure out why it failed... ...maybe she could try it again. Okay! Time to press for some more information!)
Cross-Examination-- Overview of the Second Murder --
Ema:
The latest victim was Puhray Zeh'lot.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
What kind of person was Acolyte Zeh'lot?
Ema:
According to the neighbors and others who knew him... ...he was a deeply devout youth.
Nahyuta:
I, too, have heard his name mentioned as one who was a fervent practitioner. I suppose you might say he was the high priest's star disciple.
Ema:
Furthermore...
Ema:
He had been training under the high priest, and living at his house for the past two years.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Two years? Are you sure about that?
Ema:
We took statements from his neighbors and his fellow monks. They all corroborate our initial findings.
Phoenix:
What about you, Maya?
Maya:
...Well, when I first came here... ...I saw Zeh'lot praying under the high priest's instruction.
Phoenix:
I see... So the results of the police investigation seem to check out...
Ema:
The high priest's widow Beh'leeb Inmee has identified the victim's body.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Was Mrs. Inmee's positive ID the only way you verified the identity of the victim?
Ema:
Huh? ...Well, no! We also checked the ID card he carried and the data in his family registry. But...
Phoenix:
But what?
Ema:
His personal information didn't match any of the public records we cross-referenced.
Phoenix:
Maybe that's why the Divination Séance failed.
Ema:
I-I'm not sure what you mean, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Here's what I'm thinking...
His address was wrong
Phoenix:
The victim's address was wrong!
Ema:
Um... Mr. Wright? Even if it was wrong, how would that affect the Divination Séance?
Phoenix:
Oh, uhh... You're right. It wouldn't. (What was it that a Divination Séance required, again? Oh, right! Then there is only one possible answer!)
Ema:
It looks like the fact that his personal info wasn't in the public records isn't important.
Phoenix:
No, Ema, it is important.
Leads to:
"The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason..."
Puhray Zeh'lot is a fake name
Leads to:
"The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason..."
Phoenix:
The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason... In other words, he was using a fake name! The royal priestess uses a deceased's face and true name to summon their spirit.
Rayfa:
Why, yes, that is indeed true.
Nahyuta:
If he was using a forged ID and there is no mention of him in our public records... ...then he was likely an illegal immigrant. They are not uncommon here in Khura'in.
Phoenix:
An illegal immigrant? (Come to think of it, Rayfa mentioned something about immigrants yesterday.)
Ema:
But if that's the case, we have no way of knowing who he really is. We'll have to proceed without holding a Divination Séance this time.
Phoenix:
Urk!
Judge:
I had always thought that Acolyte Zeh'lot was Khura'inese. Oh, how the high priest must be lamenting his disciple's deception in the Twilight Realm. Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think? Should we add this to the testimony?
Add it to the testimony
Phoenix:
This is an important fact. Please add it to the testimony.
Judge:
Hmm... It would seem to be a fact most inconvenient for the defense. But, if you insist. Detective Skye, please add what you just said to your testimony.
Ema:
Yes, Your Magistry.
Add statement:
"He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name."
Don't add it to the testimony
Phoenix:
No, Your Magistry. There's no need to add it to her testimony.
Judge:
Very well, then. Please continue if you would, Detective Skye.
Ema:
Yes, Your Magistry. We still don't know the victim's true identity, but...
Press (after adding "He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.")
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But the victim was using a fake name, so... ...he may very well have been in Khura'in illegally.
Ema:
Y-Yes, that's very likely the case.
Phoenix:
(Now that I have an opening, what next? It's still not going to help me learn Zeh'lot's true identity. Was he really an illegal alien?)
Ema:
He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Isn't there some way to track down his real name?
Ema:
No, not if he was an illegal immigrant.
Phoenix:
Have you actually confirmed that he was in Khura'in illegally?
Ema:
Well, we don't have any conclusive evidence. But there's also no evidence of him being a citizen of Khura'in, either.
Phoenix:
Hoh boy... Now what do we do...
Maya:
What if there was a clue in the evidence you gathered?
Phoenix:
That's probably our only hope at this point. (If he really was an illegal immigrant, our proverbial goose is probably cooked.)
Present Crime Photo (Zeh'lot)
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Sorry, Detective Skye..."
Ema:
He may have been mistaken for a rebel and killed due to his connection to the high priest.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Maya isn't that Lady Kee'ra who's been going around capturing rebels!
Ema:
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright, but... 
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
That verdict was already handed down in the previous trial. It is no longer a point of dispute, and I will not allow you to make it so.
Phoenix:
But...!
Nahyuta:
No "ifs," "ands," and most of all, no "buts." The accused was posing as Lady Kee'ra. And she killed Acolyte Zeh'lot because she mistakenly believed him to be a rebel.
Maya:
Th-That's not true!
Ema:
I'm sorry... The verdict has already been read in that case. I have to assume that it's fact now.
Phoenix:
Arngh!
Before adding statement "He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name."
Phoenix:
Maya, you mentioned that Ema's testimony might hold a clue as to why the Séance failed.
Maya:
I did, but it's really just a hunch.
Phoenix:
(That might mean there was a mistake made during the investigation. It would have to be information that would impact the Séance. Hmm, what could it be...?)
After adding statement "He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name."
Phoenix:
(Now I know why the Divination Séance failed, but...)
Maya:
Umm, nothing's really changed.
Phoenix:
Yeah, which means we're in big trouble.
Maya:
If he really was an illegal immigrant, it's going to be real hard to find out his real name...
Phoenix:
(I guess our only choice is to give up on the whole Divination Séance thing. If only there was some way to find out the victim's real name...)
Phoenix:
Sorry, Detective Skye... But the police missed something important in their investigation.
Ema:
Huh?! Wh-What are you talking about?!
Phoenix:
The victim was undeniably a Khura'inese native! And this crime scene photo proves it.
Judge:
I-It does?!
Phoenix:
It's a little hard to see, but look closely. You'll see clear proof that the victim was Khura'inese.
Ema:
Wh-Where? I don't see anything that would prove that!
Phoenix:
This proves the victim was Khura'inese!
Present neck tattoo
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Look at this tattoo right here!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Judge:
Hmm...  fail to understand how that proves anything.
Phoenix:
Oh, don't worry, Your Magistry. I don't understand it, either!
Judge:
Your ineptitude is equally unfathomable, defense!
Phoenix:
(Argh... I better take a good look at that photo again.)
Judge:
Your claim that the victim was Khura'inese... Is it not but another one of your lawyerly untruths?
Phoenix:
No. If you look here in this photo, you'll see that he's definitely Khura'inese!
Leads back to:
"This proves the victim was Khura'inese!"
Phoenix:
Look at this tattoo right here!
Judge:
Why that's... a tattoo of a peach?
Phoenix:
I would like you all to think about the meaning of this tattoo.
Ema:
Oh, umm... The victim really liked peaches?
Judge:
Well, peaches are a favored delicacy here in Khura'in.
Nahyuta:
They happen to be a personal favorite of mine. The sweetness of their abundant nectars and the softness of their perfectly ripe flesh... They are a blessing from the Holy Mother herself.
Maya:
Nick, I've suddenly got a craving for peaches!
Phoenix:
...After the trial, Maya. Right now we have bigger fish to fry. Unfortunately, that is NOT a tattoo of a peach.
Nahyuta:
...It is not a peach, you say? Then what is it?
Phoenix:
Take a closer look. Haven't you seen something like that before? Namely, the tattoo on the high priest's brow.
Judge:
Oh, my!
Ema:
What?!
Phoenix:
This mark is only borne by members of the Khura'inist clergy!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
So that is what you believe it to be. But are they not utterly different shapes?
Phoenix:
Sure, they're shaped differently, but there's a reason for that. The victim had the peach-shaped tattoo inked over an existing tattoo for some reason. However, the dark red portion is exactly the same as the mark all Khura'inist clergy bear.
Ema:
Hey, you're right!
Judge:
Hmm... Until about twenty-some-odd years ago, everyone did get one, didn't they? I myself bear one on my right buttoc--
Nahyuta:
That is entirely too much information, Your Magistry.
Phoenix:
Information on everyone who enters the clergy is maintained at the temple! All we have to do is look up a monk with a mark in the same spot!
Ema:
I'm on it! I'll let you know if I get any hits!
Nahyuta:
That will not be necessary. If you seek information on the clergy... ...I have it all right here.
Judge:
Oh, my! You never cease to amaze! ...So, tell us, is there anyone who fits the bill?
Nahyuta:
.............................. ...There is just one, and his name is Rheel Neh'mu. He became a monk twenty years ago.
Phoenix:
Then that must be the victim's real name.
Judge:
But why would he have tried to cover up his tattoo with another one?
Phoenix:
(Yeah... There must've been some reason...)
Maya:
Nick! That's not important right now. The important thing is we know his real name.
Phoenix:
You're right! Your Magistry! Now that we know the victim's real name... ...the Divination Séance might finally work!
Judge:
Hmm... A lawyer who willingly seeks a Séance... This is entirely unprecedented.
Nahyuta:
Heh. You are but digging your own grave, defense.
Phoenix:
We won't know that until we try. (Sure, it's risky, but it's our only hope!)
Judge:
Very well. Let the Divination Séance be held once more! 
Rayfa:
.............................. Why would a lawyer work so hard to see the Divination Séance be held once more? You are a fool, Barbed Head. And your foolishness shall yield no gratitude from me. For with the truth revealed by my Insights, I shall gladly seek your demise!
Phoenix:
...Bring it on, Princess. Because I will correctly interpret each and every one of your Insights.
Rayfa:
Hmph! You will regret ever thinking you could use my sacred Insights as evidence. O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination Séance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!
Judge:
...Oh, my! It is just as Mr. Wright surmised. Puhray Zeh'lot wasn't the victim's true name! And now at last, we have seen the victim's final moments!
Phoenix:
B-But... All we could see was the ground!
Nahyuta:
You seem terribly disappointed. I take it you did not find any fodder for one of your infamous turnabouts?
Phoenix:
Ngrk!
Nahyuta:
I, on the other hand, have discovered something: Conclusive evidence that establishes the accused's guilt!
Phoenix:
Y-You did?!
Judge:
Ha ha ha ha ha! A most surprising surprise attack! ...So, tell us, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, what is this conclusive evidence you have found?
Nahyuta:
...The Plumed Punisher theme song that the deceased heard. Please consider this item here. It was confiscated from the accused during her interrogation.
Maya:
Hey, that's my Plumed Punisher strap!
Nahyuta:
When you press the magatama on the Plumed Punisher's belt...
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Nahyuta:
It seems the accused inadvertently pressed the button in the midst of her crime. This strap is an extremely rare item, is it not, Ms. Fey?
Maya:
You'd better not break it! There's only one of those in the whole wide world!
Phoenix:
M-Maya, noooooooooo!
Rayfa:
Heh heh heh heh! It is just as I said. Your flights of fancy... have come crashing down on you!
Maya:
She sure seems to be enjoying this.
Phoenix:
Yeah... I've never seen her look so thrilled before either.
Rayfa:
It is time to accept the fact that the Divination Séance is far more than mere evidence! It is the very truth that brings the hammer of justice down upon the accused!
Judge:
That is as conclusive as evidence can get. Now then, if there are no further objections...
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Slow down there, Your Magistry. At least let me make a counterargument!
Judge:
What's this? Do you take issue with the Divination Séance?
Phoenix:
(Oh, I have issues with it. I just don't know what they are yet. But that's never stopped me before!) The Divination Séance is not the absolute truth! It only becomes the truth after it's been interpreted correctly.
Rayfa:
Grr! You do not know when you are beaten, do you, you foolish lawyer. I am the only one who speaks for the mitamah of the deceased! If you believe there to be errors in my Insights, then let us see you prove it!
Insight -- Rayfa's Insight --
Rayfa:
The victim was offering up his prayers...
It was the night of the rite. The pattern on the plaza's ground was visible in the darkness.
Then, someone was there... and the theme to "The Plumed Punisher" filled the air...
The accused held the victim down and plunged her dagger into his upper back.
The blade struck true, and in that instant, he departed from this world...
Rayfa:
That is everything the deceased experienced in his final moments.
Nahyuta:
Her Benevolence's Insights have painted a detailed picture, both vivid and true.
Phoenix:
(I didn't notice any holes there. As they stand now, those Insights are really stacked against us. I'll just have to go over each and every one of the deceased's sensations very carefully.)
Rayfa:
The victim was offering up his prayers...
It was the night of the rite. The pattern on the plaza's ground was visible in the darkness.
Present Gingihl (Smell) on second panel
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Was it really the night of the rite...?"
Then, someone was there... and the theme to "The Plumed Punisher" filled the air...
The accused held the victim down and plunged her dagger into his upper back.
The blade struck true, and in that instant, he departed from this world...
Phoenix:
Was it really the night of the rite...?
Rayfa:
What do you mean? It could not be otherwise! The accused slew Acolyte Zeh'lot after killing the high priest during the Purification Rite.
Phoenix:
The only problem is, the deceased's spirit does not corroborate that.
Rayfa:
What's this?!
Phoenix:
Take a good look at what the victim smelled. Do you see how it says "gingihl"? Acolyte Zeh'lot shouldn't have smelled any gingihl on the night of the rite!
Judge:
Wh-What do you mean?
Phoenix:
Let me back up my statement with some evidence for you. This should explain how the victim couldn't have smelled gingihl on the night of the rite!
Present Beh'leeb's Statement
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The high priest's wife, Beh'leeb Inmee, told me about the Feast of Blessings."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
			
Judge:
............... To be frank, your assertion stinks, defense.
Phoenix:
Does it smell that bad?
Judge:
Indeed. I nearly passed out from the stench.
Phoenix:
(I didn't know my bluffs had such a pungent aroma...)
Judge:
It would seem that the smell of gingihl is unrelated to the case at hand.
Phoenix:
No, the fact that the victim smelled gingihl is extremely important. It's important because the smell shouldn't have been present on the night of the rite.
Leads back to:
"This should explain how the victim couldn't have smelled gingihl on the night of the rite!"
Phoenix:
The high priest's wife, Beh'leeb Inmee, told me about the Feast of Blessings. The feast includes a number of gingihl-based dishes. And they're only supposed to be served at a certain time the day before the rite!
Judge:
Why, I believe you're right! I had completely forgotten about that.
Phoenix:
During the feast, the unique smell of gingihl pervades the entire kingdom. The fact that the victim smelled it means... ...he was murdered between noon and 3 PM the day before the Purification Rite!
Rayfa:
That's enough!
Rayfa:
Hmph. I am not so easily fooled! Did that autopsy report not make it clear? The estimated time of death was during the rite!
Phoenix:
(Oh, right. I taught her about that yesterday.) Forgive me, Your Benevolence... ...but the estimated time of death is just that -- an estimate. Depending on the circumstances, it's possible for it to change.
Rayfa:
Wh-What's this?!
Phoenix:
Like, if a body was kept cold, the slowed rate of decay makes the death seem more recent.
Judge:
Why, I believe I have heard something of the sort before. Hmm... If it is as Mr. Wright claims... ...the estimated time of death in the autopsy report will have to be revised.
Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.
Rayfa:
Nnnggrrrrrrrrrrr! Barbed Head! You... You blinded me with science!
Phoenix:
S-Sorry... (Wait, what am I apologizing for?)
Rayfa:
Hmph. ...No matter. The murder may have occurred in the afternoon hours the day before the rite. Nevertheless... The murder weapon with the accused's prints on it is incontrovertible evidence. I will now amend my Insight to account for this new truth.
Insight Revised
It was the night of the rite. The pattern on the plaza's ground was visible in the darkness.
It was the afternoon of the day before the rite. Though a bit dark, the pattern on the plaza's ground was visible.
Rayfa:
The time of death has been corrected, leaving my Insight infallible.
Maya:
Nick! A change in the time of death is bound to cause some sort of an inconsistency!
Phoenix:
(If I had something that showed what it was like on that day, it could really help.)
Rayfa:
The victim was offering up his prayers...
It was the afternoon of the day before the rite. Though a bit dark, the pattern on the plaza's ground was visible.

Then, someone was there... and the theme to "The Plumed Punisher" filled the air...
The accused held the victim down and plunged her dagger into his upper back.
The blade struck true, and in that instant, he departed from this world...
Phoenix:
The change in the date and time of the crime... ...has caused a new inconsistency to surface.
Rayfa:
What's this?! Augh! You are making that irritating face again! Cease that at once!
Phoenix:
Sorry, but this is the face I was born with. Now, let's focus on what is important -- what the victim saw in his final moments.
Rayfa:
Do you have bats in the belfry, Barbed Head? There is nothing to see. The ground at the plaza was all that entered the victim's eyes.
Phoenix: 
And that's what I find so strange. On the day before the rite, it should've been impossible to see that pattern on the ground!
Judge:
Impossible, you say?! ...Do explain.
Phoenix:
This piece of evidence shows why the plaza's ground was not visible that day!

Judge:
.............................. Are you sure that shows why the ground was not visible?
Phoenix:
I'm positive!
Nahyuta:
I know not what the defense thinks he sees... ...but I see a lawyer spouting nonsense.
Judge:
Perhaps this will open his eyes.
Phoenix:
(Okay, I guess that wasn't it.)
Judge:
Now, I will ask you once more. What piece of evidence shows that the plaza ground was not visible that day?
Leads back to:
"This piece of evidence shows why the plaza's ground was not visible that day!"
Phoenix:
This newspaper has an article that is tiny in size, but huge in importance. It says that the ground was covered with "thick, white ice" the day before the rite.
Rayfa:
What?! B-But...!
Judge:
The victim did not see so much as an ice cube on the ground!
Phoenix:
Exactly. And so we must ask: What WAS the victim looking at in his final moments?
Rayfa:
If you have something to say, then say it!
Phoenix:
The last thing the victim saw was not the ground at the Plaza of Devotion. This can only mean that he was killed elsewhere!
Rayfa:
Wha--!
Nahyuta:
Wha--!
Judge:
Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Then where do you propose the victim was actually killed?
Rayfa:
Yes, tell us where! Otherwise, your argument is worthless!
Phoenix:
Um, about that... (Argh, I hadn't gotten to that part yet!) Any ideas, Maya?
Maya:
Umm... Let me think... Well... it's somewhere green and shaggy, right?
Phoenix:
Right, but where could that be?
Rayfa:
What is it, Barbed Head? Giving up already?
Phoenix:
N-Not at all! (Now, where have I seen something green and shaggy...?) This shows where the victim was killed!

Judge:
...I was imagining giving you a penalty, but now I don't have to just imagine it anymore.
Phoenix:
(Imagine that...)
Rayfa:
I knew it. The victim could not have been killed anywhere but the plaza.
Phoenix:
No, he was killed elsewhere! (It was somewhere green and shaggy. I know I've seen someplace like that, but where?)
Leads back to:
"This shows where the victim was killed!"
Phoenix:
The secret hideout the rebels were using!
Rayfa:
The rebel hideout? There was no such place anywhere on the floor of that chamber!
Phoenix:
You're absolutely right. (There's no place... on the floor, anyway.)
Judge:
Then what did the victim see in his final moments if not the floor of the rebel hideout?
Phoenix:
This is what the victim saw in his final moments!

Phoenix:
(If the reason why the moss had been disturbed is what I think it is...)

Oh, sorry. I was thinking about my answer.

The victim was killed here!
Judge:
But... how could he have been killed in such a place?
Phoenix:
Good question... What are your thoughts, Your Magistry?
Judge:
Didn't your mother tell you not to answer a question with a question?!
Phoenix:
Mamma mia... (The same pattern as the one at the plaza... Let's take a good look around.) Your Magistry! Please give me another chance!
Judge:
Very well, then. But there is a limit to my patience. Now, show me where you believe the victim was killed.
Leads back to:
"This is what the victim saw in his final moments!"
Phoenix:
The shaggy green surface the victim saw was one of the moss-covered stone slabs! As you can see, there are two distinct hand-shaped impressions in the moss here. I believe the victim was killed while he stood there with his hands pressed against the slab!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
That does agree with the Séance vision. However, one cannot definitely declare they are one and the same.
Judge:
I concur. There is no proof that a murder occurred in the rebel hideout.
Rayfa:
Indeed! What evidence do you have of this?!
Phoenix:
I've already shown you the evidence.
Judge:
Wh-What do you mean?
Phoenix:
Please take a look at this second version of the photo I just showed you. You can see the results of the luminol test I performed in the rebel hideout. This is proof positive that someone had been bleeding in front of that stone slab.
Judge:
Is this true?!
Phoenix:
This information has already been provided to the police.
Judge:
Detective Skye, to whom does this blood belong?
Ema:
W-We thought it was the high priest's blood that flowed in from outside... ...so we haven't tested it yet.
Judge:
Then you must do so at once!
Ema:
Y-Yes, Your Magistry!
Judge:
It appears the police have finished testing the blood. Detective Skye, your report, please.
Ema:
The blood found in the rebel hideout... ...belongs to Puhray Zeh'lot, just like the defense claims!
Nahyuta:
Detective Skye, do you realize what your blunder has done to me? When this trial concludes, I want to see you in my prayer chamber. There, I will deliver a joyous sermon onto you for eight hours straight.
Ema:
I-I'm really sorry, but... Please, anything but that!
Maya:
...Nick, maybe, just maybe... ...this is the chance we've been waiting for!
Phoenix:
Yep, it would seem so. (I hate to do this to Ema, but...)
Maya:
Go for it! It's full speed ahead!
Phoenix:
The victim was killed in the rebel hideout the day before the Purification Rite. Then, his body was moved to the Plaza of Devotion by someone we've yet to identify! So, when we thought we saw Acolyte Zeh'lot praying during the rite, he was already dead!
Rayfa:
Aaaaaaugh!
Phoenix:
And that's not all. If he was killed at the Inner Sanctum, that would explain one more thing.
Judge:
And that would be...?
Phoenix:
How the time of death was made to look later than it actually was. The proof of which, was left behind at the sanctum. This points to how the time of death was made to appear later than it actually was!
Present Inner Sanctum Photo
Phoenix:

"Why, these are..."

Nahyuta:
Do you truly believe that could affect the estimated time of death?
Phoenix:
A-And why not?!
Nahyuta:
Then let us test this idea on YOUR body.
Phoenix:
Errr... Pass?
Judge:
Mr. Wright's body may still be alive, but he appears very much brain-dead.
Phoenix:
(Urgh... I blew that one.)
Judge:
So no one attempted to cover up the true time of death.
Phoenix:
No, I believe someone did!
Leads back to:
"This points to how the time of death was made to appear later than it actually was!"
Judge:
Why, these are... photos of the Inner Sanctum?
Phoenix:
I'd like you to focus on this one. The proof is right here in this photo. This is how the time of death was made to appear later than it really was. Do you see how the snow has been removed from this one spot only? That's because it was used to keep the victim's body cold. And that's why the time of death wasn't what it seemed!
Rayfa:
That's enough!
Rayfa:
The time was mistaken? And the place, too? And just what do you believe that proves?
Phoenix:
Th-That my client is innocent.
Rayfa:
What of her fingerprints on the dagger, and the Plumed Punisher theme the victim heard? You have failed to address these two key pieces of evidence.
Phoenix:
Urk! I-I see your point.
Maya:
Wasn't this your big chance, Nick?!
Phoenix:
Ahh... I'm really hoping that the difference in location can invalidate... ...either the weapon or the theme song from being used as evidence against you.
Maya:
Actually, that might be possible. At least, for one of them.
Phoenix:
Really?!
Rayfa:
What's this? You say you can contradict our argument for a key piece of evidence?! Very well, let us see you try!
Maya:
Nick, take a good look at the rebel hideout photo!
Phoenix:
Umm... Uhh... ...Oh! The defense can invalidate this piece of evidence!
The fingerprints on the dagger
Phoenix:
The dagger with my client's prints on it. It's inconsistent with the facts that have come to light!
Rayfa:
I fail to see how you can contradict the fact that her fingerprints were on the weapon.
Judge:
We do not take kindly to such stalling tactics here in the Hall of Justice.
Phoenix:
Argh, sorry... (I guess there's nothing wrong with the murder weapon. Then that leaves...)
Rayfa:
You have not found any contradictions with the evidence!
Phoenix:
But the fact that the murder didn't occur at the plaza DOES affect the evidence! It results in a contradiction with the Plumed Punisher theme song the victim heard!
Leads to:
"The Plumed Punisher theme?"
The Plumed Punisher theme
Leads to:
"The Plumed Punisher theme?"
Rayfa:
The Plumed Punisher theme? And how do you intend to support such a claim?!
Phoenix:
Since the murder happened in the rebel hideout... ...there's something there that played the theme song, other than my client's strap!
Judge:
It wasn't the strap?! Is this true?
Phoenix:
The item that played The Plumed Punisher theme song was this!
Present Plumed Punisher clock
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"This is a Plumed Punisher alarm clock."

How could that have possibly played the theme song?!
Phoenix:

Rayfa:
Nonsense! I have never seen such an item before!
Judge:
Nor have I.
Phoenix:
(Why is everyone around here a Plumed Punisher expert?)
Judge:
It seems there was nothing there that could have played the Plumed Punisher theme.
Phoenix:
No, Your Magistry! Something in the hideout played it!
Leads back to:
"The item that played The Plumed Punisher theme song was this!"
Phoenix:
This is a Plumed Punisher alarm clock. I believe the victim heard its alarm go off!
Rayfa:
That's enough!
Rayfa:
What proof do you have that the alarm went off?!
Phoenix:
What proof do YOU have that it was my client's strap that played the theme song?!
Rayfa:
Auuugh! Do not twist the facts with your lawyerly wiles! Either way, the accused would still be guilty based off of her prints on the murder weapon. And here is what really happened!
Insight Revised
The victim was offering up his prayers...
The victim stood with his hands on the stone slab in the hideout.
It was the afternoon of the day before the rite. Though a bit dark, the pattern on the plaza's ground was visible.
It was the afternoon of the day before the rite.
Rayfa:
Though there have been some twists and turns, that is the truth of what happened.
Phoenix:
Arngh! (I won't get anywhere until I can eliminate the dagger.)
Judge:
Most impressive, Your Benevolence. I see no inconsistencies anywhere in the prosecution's case.
Phoenix:
No, there is one!

What's this?! You still claim there to be an inconsistency?!
Rayfa:
Hmph. Try as you might, the outcome will always be the same.

Then, someone was there... and the theme to "The Plumed Punisher" filled the air...
The accused held the victim down and plunged her dagger into his upper back.
The blade struck true, and in that instant, he departed from this world...
Phoenix:
The victim was originally thought to have been stabbed while bent over in prayer. But he was actually standing with his hands against the stone slab. So the question is, where did the sensation of something heavy come from?
Judge:
Hmm. Yes, I see your point.
Phoenix:
Since the victim was standing, he couldn't have been held down.
Rayfa:
Eeeep!
Judge:
Then tell us, Mr. Wright, what was that heavy sensation felt by the victim?
Phoenix:
Hmm... What caused the heavy sensation Zeh'lot felt? Any thoughts, Maya?
Maya:
Uhh... I agree, that sense of heaviness seems important, but... There's also the matter of Zeh'lot's hands on the stone slab. Why were they even there?
Phoenix:
Could it be related to the cause of the heavy sensation?
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Do you have an answer for us?
Phoenix:
O-Of course! (If I just envision the state Zeh'lot was in when he was killed...) The cause of the heaviness the victim felt was...
The falling stone slab
Leads to:
"The only conceivable cause is..."
The culprit jumping on him
Phoenix:
The killer jumped on him from behind!
Rayfa:
Hmm... Why do you suppose the killer would do that?
Phoenix:
Maybe they craved human contact!
Judge:
People who crave human contact do not kill those they seek contact with. But it's clear you've lost contact... with reality!
Phoenix:
Talk about a reality check...
Maya:
Wasn't there something really heavy in the rebel hideout?
Phoenix:
Of course! That's it! The cause of the heavy sensation...!
Leads to:
"The only conceivable cause is..."
Phoenix:
The only conceivable cause is... ...the stone slab falling over, trapping the victim underneath!
Judge:
What?!
Rayfa:
...!
Maya:
Oh...! The stone slab came falling down on him, crushing him underneath.
Phoenix:
Right. That was the cause of the heavy sensation the victim felt.
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
While your theory is impressive, you have overlooked a key fact. The victim was not crushed to death. Rather, he was stabbed.
Phoenix:
O-Oh yeah...
Nahyuta:
Or do you claim that the dagger was plunged in after the slab had fallen on him? Plus, had the killer been behind the victim, they would have both been crushed together.
Judge:
Well? Would you care to explain?
Phoenix:
(Sure, I'd love to. That doesn't mean I can! Hmm... How could the dagger have been plunged in after the slab fell on the victim?) The killer couldn't have plunged the dagger into the victim after the slab fell on him. But, what if the murder weapon wasn't what we thought it was?
Nahyuta:
Well, there WERE other weapons in the rebel hideout. But the entrance to the hideout is right by the stone slab. There isn't enough space between the two to use any of the weapons found within.
Phoenix:
Yeah... There's not much space by the entrance, is there... (So, what was the real murder weapon, then? I better think of something!)
Maya:
If the murder weapon wasn't the dagger... ...then the dagger must've been plunged into the victim after he was already dead. That means he was stabbed at least twice, but the autopsy doesn't mention that.
Phoenix:
Then he must've been stabbed in the same spot with something shaped like the dagger.
Nahyuta:
Would the defense care to offer an explanation sometime this century?
Phoenix:
(Wait, wasn't there something dagger-like near the scene of the crime? ...Something that had a shape similar to the Warbaa'd Dagger?)
Judge:
Present your evidence at this time, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
This shows what really killed the victim!

Judge:
Your ignorance shall cut you like a knife, defense.
Maya:
Something shaped like a dagger...
Phoenix:
I better compare the shape of the dagger with the rest of the evidence again.
Judge:
Now then, I would have the defense cut the nonsense and offer a proper answer this time. What really killed the victim, if it wasn't the dagger?
Leads back to:	
"This shows what really killed the victim!"

Judge:
Ha ha ha ha! Indeed! Perhaps the real murder weapon was the defense's own cranium!
Phoenix:
You won't be laughing after I show you what really killed the victim!
Judge:
Well, you will not be laughing after this penalty, either!
Phoenix:
Yowch! (Let's try that again... It's right here in the photo... The sharp object that took Zeh'lot's life!)
Leads back to:
"This is what really took Puhray Zeh'lot's life!"
Judge:
B-But that is the...!
Rayfa:
The warbaa'd statue?!
Phoenix:
Exactly! The warbaa'd statue has dagger-like feathers protruding from it. That is what really took the victim's life!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
You imbecilic fool! The statue is outside of the hideout! How do you propose it impaled someone who was inside?
Phoenix:
Haven't you heard? The warbaa'd statue also functions as the hideout's door.
Nahyuta:
...What do you mean?
Phoenix:
The statue can pull a complete switcheroo!
Nahyuta:
A switch... eroo...?
Phoenix:
To put it simply... it's a revolving door!
Judge:
A revolving door?! Why, that makes perfect sense!
Phoenix:
Therefore, I believe the truth behind the Divination Séance to be this! As the victim entered the secret hideout, the stone sculpture came toppling toward him. He threw up his hands to stop it, but its weight forced him backwards. Unfortunately, the warbaa'd statue was right behind him.
Rayfa:
Th-This... This cannot be...!
Rayfa:
That's enough!
Rayfa:
B-But the accused's fingerprints were found on the dagger!
Phoenix:
She had held it while rehearsing for the rite. Which is when her prints got on it!
Nahyuta:
...Gah!
Judge:
This is a shocking turn of events, but... ...there is a great deal of circumstantial evidence in the defense's favor. I believe we must accept that the warbaa'd statue was what killed the victim.
Warbaa'd Statue added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Now that we know how Acolyte Zeh'lot really met his demise... ...there's no basis for claiming my client committed this crime!
Maya:
Nice work, Nick!
Rayfa:
...How can this be happening yet again? The Divination Séance...  is the only truth!
Phoenix:
No, Your Benevolence. It's not the truth itself, but it IS a means for shedding light on the truth!
Rayfa:
Nnngh!
Phoenix:
Do you understand now? Your kingdom needs lawyers so that they can interpret your Insights.
Rayfa:
B-But... That means I... ...I have been misinterpreting the voices of the spirits all this time?
Judge:
Y-Your Benevolence! Are you unwell? All the color has drained from your face.
Rayfa:
........................ I will be fine. Continue your proceedings without me.
Judge:
...As you wish.
Phoenix:
(I feel kind of bad for her.)
Judge:
Now then, I would have the defense continue. Please explain what you have learned now that we know how the victim actually died.
Phoenix:
Acolyte Zeh'lot was killed in the hideout before the high priest's murder. That means the body found at the Plaza of Devotion was moved there by the real killer... ...but only after the Warbaa'd Dagger was thrust into him... ...to make it look like the murder weapon.
Judge:
Th-That does seem to agree with what we now know. But why would the real killer go to such lengths?
Phoenix:
I believe stabbing Acolyte Zeh'lot's body with the dagger and moving it to the plaza was...
A warning from the Twilight Realm
Phoenix:
It was a warning from the Twilight Realm. You know, something like... "Thou shalt not leave bodies lying around the Inner Sanctum."
Nahyuta:
You putrid-headed lawyer. Have you already forgotten? The high priest's body WAS left lying in the Inner Sanctum.
Phoenix:
Oh, right.
Nahyuta:
If the killer did not wish for bodies to be left at the Inner Sanctum... ...they would have moved the high priest's corpse, as well.
Phoenix:
(W-Well, he's not wrong...)
Judge:
How is this for a warning, Mr. Wright? Thou shalt not offer half-baked answers!
Phoenix:
(Next time, I better look before I leap.)
Judge:
Hmm. It seems the reason why the body was moved will remain a mystery.
Phoenix:
No, Your Magistry. I believe I can explain why!
Leads back to:
"I believe stabbing Acolyte Zeh'lot's body with the dagger and moving it to the plaza was..."
A crime committed for fun
Phoenix:
Maybe this was a crime committed for fun. The killer is someone who loves watching people react to murder scenes. That explains why they placed the body where so many people would see it!
Nahyuta:
But then why would the killer bother meddling with the estimated time of death?
Phoenix:
Oh, umm... That's a good point.
Judge:
Sitting through your silly answers is no fun, but I do enjoy levying penalties afterwards.
Phoenix:
(Argh... Well, I don't.)
Judge:
Hmm. It seems the reason why the body was moved will remain a mystery.
Phoenix:
No, Your Magistry. I believe I can explain why!
Leads back to:
"I believe stabbing Acolyte Zeh'lot's body with the dagger and moving it to the plaza was..."
To make it look like a serial murder
Leads to:
"It was an attempt to make my client look like a serial killer."
Phoenix:
It was an attempt to make my client look like a serial killer. That's right! The real killer planned all of this. This forged serial murder case!
Judge:
They did?!
Maya:
That's it, Nick! Keep hammering away!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Your reasoning has more holes in it than that cheese you foreigners so enjoy.
Phoenix:
What...?
Nahyuta:
Like those putrid, hole-riddled clumps of curds that only a rat like you could love... ...your reasoning, much like your putrid, hole-riddled brain, has putrefied.
Phoenix:
(What's his deal with things going putrid...?)
Nahyuta:
You have yet to overturn my argument that the accused is the killer. A careful analysis of the chain of events up to the killing exposes the truth as follows: Disguised as Lady Kee'ra, the accused found the rebel hideout the day before the rite. But Acolyte Zeh'lot had followed her there after noticing her suspicious behavior. Caught by surprise, she pushed the stone slab toward him... and we know the rest.
Maya:
I-I've never been to the rebel hideout in my life!
Nahyuta:
When the high priest arrived at the sanctum the next day, he realized what she had done. That is when the accused murdered him in order to silence him.
Judge:
Hmm... I believe Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has posed a compelling scenario. The defense, on the other hand, has yet to disprove the accused's guilt.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Why would my client move Acolyte Zeh'lot's body to where everyone could see it? And why would she stab the dagger with her fingerprints into his dead body? She had no reason to do any of those things!
Nahyuta:
The dagger in his corpse was likely a warning to the rebels. Something along the lines of "Lady Kee'ra will slay the Defiant Dragons."
Judge:
So that is why she moved the body to the plaza for all to see...
Phoenix:
(Now he has the judge convinced, too?! I thought I'd finally made some headway!)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? About time for one of your groans of distress, is it not?
Phoenix:
("G-Groan of distress"...? It kills me to admit this, but I've got nothing to counter his argument with. And I still haven't disproven the allegations 
against Maya.)
Judge:
Is it not time to end your futile struggle? You were already judged guilty yesterday. That makes you a dead lawyer walking. Accept the death that now awaits you, and in doing so, finally know peace.
Nahyuta:
A dead lawyer walking, indeed... Then again, are not all lawyers who practice in Khura'in? But I must admit, I misspoke earlier. Allow me to amend my statement. I had said the defense's reasoning had a putrid, cheese-like smell... ...but I now realize the stench was from his own putrid body, on the verge of death.
Phoenix:
(Now I'm a rotting zombie... Think... Who could've killed Zeh'lot the day before the rite? Who knew about the rebel hideout, and could gain access to the Inner Sanctum?)
Maya:
Hmm... Only those involved with the rite can enter the sanctum, so... 
Phoenix:
...Wait a second! (Only a rebel would've known about the secret hideout. And the only person who was involved with the rite, had access to the sanctum... ...and was suspected of being a rebel is...) Ahhhhhhhhh!
Maya:
Did somebody come to mind?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes... Except there's one huge problem.
Maya:
A huge problem?
Nahyuta:
What are you two going on about? Plotting your escape from this sacred hall? I would not put it past you, considering you have no means to raise further objection.
Phoenix:
(If I don't do something, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi will have this one in the bag. I'll just have to bluff my way out of this, regardless of that huge problem.) Your Magistry, I believe there is another suspect in Puhray Zeh'lot's murder!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Even the most benevolent Holy Mother would not forgive such a desperate lie. After all, you know very well that such a person does not exist.
Phoenix:
N-No, there is one person who knew everything!
Judge:
D-Does such a figure truly exist?! Tell us, who might that be?
Phoenix:
I believe the prime suspect in Acolyte Zeh'lot's murder is...!

Maya:
Jeez! This is all your fault, Nick!

Judge:
Three strikes and you're out, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Argh,  I'd better rethink my strategy... (I'm looking for someone who was allowed to enter the sanctum and knew of the hideout. Such a person could very well have killed Zeh'lot!) 
Judge:
If you fail to give a serious answer this time, I will personally put a muzzle on you. Now, who is this new suspect you believe to have killed the victim?
Leads back to:
"I believe the prime suspect in Acolyte Zeh'lot's murder is...!"
Phoenix:
It had to be someone allowed to enter the sanctum, and who knew of the hideout. And that would be... the high priest. He could've committed the crime if it occurred the day before the rite!
Nahyuta:
You would pin a crime upon the dead, knowing very well they tell no tales? Have you no shame!
Phoenix:
(Dead men tell no tales... That is definitely a problem. If only the high priest could tell his side of the story.)
Maya:
...Umm. Hmm... ...Wh-What? Do I have something on my face?
Phoenix:
...Wait a second! (Could this actually work?!)
Maya:
Oh, no! Don't tell me I have some of my breakfast caught between my teeth!
Phoenix:
(No, if there's even the slightest possibility, I'll have to go with it!) Your Magistry! Dead men DO tell tales! Therefore, I would like to request the high priest's testimony!
Judge:
His... testimony?! And just how do you propose we get the deceased to testify?
Phoenix:
There's a way for the dead to testify!  It's known as...!
Divination Séance
Phoenix:
All we have to do is have another Divination Séance with the high priest's spirit!
Nahyuta:
We already conducted a Séance with his spirit during the previous trial.What do you possibly hope to gain from another one?
Phoenix:
Oh, right...
Judge:
Speak of that sacred ritual needlessly, defense, and reap the consequences.
Phoenix:
(How could we get a dead man to tell his tale? Ah!  I wonder if Maya could...!) Your Magistry! There IS a way for the high priest to testify.
Leads to:
"Summon him here by means of spirit channeling!"
Channeling
Leads to:
"Summon him here by means of spirit channeling!"
Phoenix:
Summon him here by means of spirit channeling!
Judge:
Wh-What did you just say?!
Gallery:
Spirit channeling? Has this lawyer finally gone insane?!This is sacrilege! May the Holy Mother strike him down!
Judge:
Peace! I am frankly astonished you even know of such a thing. But spirit channeling is a secret art that only Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran can perform. And Her Eminence is far too busy with other duties to perform it at our pleasure.
Phoenix:
(I suspected as much. That means our only hope is...)
Maya:
..................... ...It's okay, Nick. You can tell them.
Phoenix:
But, Maya...! I thought you wanted to keep it a secret here in Khura'in.
Maya:
Don't worry. It's not like it's against the law or violates some religious precepts, so... ...I don't think we'll be punished. At least, I hope not.
Phoenix:
But this is a crucial period for you. It'll decide whether you become master of Kurain.
Maya:
We don't have any other choice, now do we? If I'm found guilty, it'll be a lot worse than not becoming master of Kurain.
Phoenix:
...All right. Thanks, Maya. Actually, there is someone here who is capable of channeling spirits.
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
But even Her Benevolence Princess Rayfa finds the Divination Séance to be a challenge. Who could possibly have greater spiritual power than she, aside from the queen?!
Maya:
Th-That... That would be... me.
Gallery:
Is this some sort of a joke? A foreigner could not possibly have such power!Even the royal priestess is incapable of such a feat!
Judge:
Peace! Peace, I say! ...Is this true? Is the accused capable of performing the secret art of spirit channeling?
Maya:
Umm...  well...  yes. Yes, I can.
Phoenix:
Now, Your Magistry, we'd like your permission to begin!
Rayfa:
That's enough!
Phoenix:
Y-Your Benevolence!
Rayfa:
This is an outrage! An outrage, I say! First, you make a mockery of the Divination Séance, and now, spirit channeling?!
Gallery:
Her Benevolence speaks the truth! Spirit channeling is a sacred rite!Foreign devils! I say they should be put to death immediately!
Rayfa:
Still your voices! Barbed Head, spirit channeling is a most sacred and secret of arts. Are you prepared to face the consequences of what you propose?
Phoenix:
Yes, I am.
Judge:
...Your Benevolence, are you saying you approve of their use of spirit channeling?
Rayfa:
I will judge whether their claim is true. If this is but another of their lies, they shall be executed on the spot!
Judge:
Very well, then! Umm... Your Benevolence? What if the accused accidentally calls forth an evil spirit?
Rayfa:
Do you truly believe this foreigner is capable of channeling spirits?
Judge:
Oh, umm...  no, but I wanted to be sure, as I am responsible for the safety of all present.
Rayfa:
Well, an inexperienced practitioner could inadvertently call forth a dangerous spirit. But do not fear, for I have a Magatama of Parting. With it, I can send spirits back to the Twilight Realm by halting the flow of spiritual power.
Judge:
...Th-That is a relief, indeed.
Rayfa:
These foreigners have thrown down the gauntlet. Let us not shirk from their challenge! We must prove them guilty and deliver their last rites! Do I make myself clear, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
Perfectly, Your Benevolence.
Judge:
Very well, the accused may channel the high priest's spirit. But first, we must take a short recess to prepare. We will resume as soon as the preparations are complete. Until then, this court is adjourned!
To Be Continued
May 12High Court of Khura'in - Accused Lobby
Phoenix:
Sorry, Maya, but this was the only way. You sure you're up for this?
Maya:
Thanks for believing in me, Nick. Even though I don't know if my channeling ability is on point yet...
Phoenix:
(Oh, right... Before she started training here, her success rate was only about thirty percent.) I know you can do it, Maya. (At least, I hope she can!) So you sure you're ready?
Maya:
Yeah, at least I think so.
Phoenix:
You don't sound so confident. What about all your training?
Maya:
Training's one thing. Actually doing it is another!
Phoenix:
Oh, I see... (Uh, oh... If she fails to channel the high priest, we're 
as good as dead.)
Maya:
Relax, Nick! You can count on me! I'll show you what my training's done for me! This will be a moment you never forget!
Phoenix:
O-Okay... (I just hope it's unforgettable in a good way.)
Maya:
Once we hear Abbot Inmee's story, I'm sure the truth will come to light!
Phoenix:
I hope so, but he was hiding the fact that he was a rebel, so... ...I doubt it'll be as cut-and-dried as all that.
Bailiff:
They are ready for you. Please return to the Hall of Justice at once.
Phoenix:
Okay, Maya, 'm counting on you!
Maya:
You got it! Here we go!
May 12High Court of Khura'in
Judge:
We have received official approval for the accused to channel a spirit here today. Now, if you will, Ms. Fey, please proceed.
Maya:
...Yes, Your Magistry.
Gallery:
I can't believe this! Only the queen should channel spirits!Execute them! Put them to death right now! Death! Death! Death! Death! Death! Death! Death! Death!
Phoenix:
(C'mon, Maya! I'm counting on you!)
Maya:
........................ I have been studying here in Khura'in for two years now... ...so that one day, I will be the master of Kurain, a village of spirit mediums back home. But first, I shall show you all the fruits of my training in your kingdom.
Phoenix:
(Wow,  she seems really confident.)
Rayfa:
Hmph. A neophyte practitioner such as you could not possibly channel a spirit.
Maya:
Okay, Your Benevolence, how about this? If I succeed, will you stop calling me a neophyte?
Rayfa:
Very well. ...IF you succeed.
Maya:
Oh, I will. Just you watch! O spirit of Tahrust Inmee, slumbering in the Twilight Realm... Return now... to the world of the living!
Tahrust:
Hrrm? What is this place?
Judge:
Oh, my!
Rayfa:
N-No...! Th-This cannot be!
Nahyuta:
P-Pohlkunkaaa!
Gallery:
...I-It's the high priest! The accused really can channel spirits!I don't believe it... The accused's spiritual power is the real deal!
Phoenix:
(Go, Maya!)
Rayfa:
I do not understand... This cannot be... This simply cannot be...! ...I-I--! I must step out now before I forget myself!
Judge:
Abbot Inmee!
Tahrust:
...Would this be the Twilight Realm? And what of this luxurious mane of hair...? Is it perhaps a gift from the Holy Mother, for decades of faithful service?!
Judge:
A... Abbot Inmee?
Tahrust:
My! But if it isn't His Magistry. Have you, too, shuffled off that mortal coil?
Judge:
Please, do not count me among the dead. It is only you who has passed on. But the spirit medium, Maya Fey, has brought you back among us today!
Tahrust:
Wh-Why... Acolyte Fey has mastered the secret art of spirit channeling?! I suppose that explains these gorgeous locks.
Judge:
When I pass from this world, I, too, hope to be channeled with a full head of hair!
Tahrust:
Though it be for the briefest of moments, I give thanks for this splendid coiffure. ...Praise be to the Holy Mother! However, this kimono is a bit too snug for my tastes. ...If you would excuse me! There, that is better.
Phoenix:
Umm... Could we get to his testimony now? (And I wish he'd kept his top on!)
Tahrust:
Hrrm? Why, you are that foreign lawyer the people speak of as of late. And is this not the Hall of Justice? Why have I been summoned here?
Judge:
Forgive us for calling you back from your eternal rest... ...but you have been accused of murder. Might we ask you to testify on your own behalf?
Tahrust:
...I have been accused of murder? That is troubling, indeed.
Phoenix:
AAAAAH! Wh-What's with that crazy pose?!
Tahrust:
Is this really cause for such astonishment? Even the lowliest of monks can achieve such body control with the proper training.
Phoenix:
(Oh...  I wonder if Ahlbi will be able to do that someday.)
Judge:
Will the defense please explain the situation to the high priest?
Phoenix:
I'd be happy to. Your disciple, Puhray Zeh'lot, has been murdered. It happened on the day before the Purification Rite. And the crime occurred in the rebel hideout hidden within the Inner Sanctum.
Tahrust:
A-Acolyte Zeh'lot? He has been killed? ...Who would do such a thing?
Phoenix:
Someone who knew of the hideout, and had access to the Inner Sanctum... In other words, YOU, Abbot Inmee. After all, weren't you secretly a rebel?
Tahrust:
..................
Phoenix:
(Oh dear... That's still Maya's body...I hope he doesn't break anything.)
Tahrust:
Hrrrmph. .....................
Gallery:
Wow! The high priest is amazing!To think he had mastered such an advanced prayer pose!He's still worthy of our veneration, even if he IS a rebel!Praise be to the Holy Mother! Praise be to the Holy Mother!
Tahrust:
Oh, my. Have my rebel allegiances been exposed? Not even my wife knew of that. It seems to rest in peace is not my fate.
Phoenix:
Why did you, a devout priest of Khura'inism, join the rebellion?
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
The high priest has come back to us for but a brief time, defense. Shall we not cut to the chase, and ask the most pressing of questions?
Phoenix:
...Oh, right!
Nahyuta:
Abbot Inmee, the prosecution believes the one who slew both you and Acolyte Zeh'lot... ...to be Maya Fey, who had been playing the role of Lady Kee'ra in the rite.
Tahrust:
Hrrm. Being that I was dead until just a moment ago... ...my memory is a bit hazy.
Nahyuta:
Could you please do your best to remember?
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The high priest says his memory is hazy!
Tahrust:
...HRRMMMMMM! It is all coming back to me. It is as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi concluded. I was slain by none other than Maya Fey.
Nahyuta:
The high priest's statement has proven my assertions with regards to his murder correct.
Phoenix:
NOOOOOOOOO! B-But what about Acolyte Zeh'lot?! You were the one who killed him, weren't you?
Tahrust:
Hrrmm...? I know naught about my disciple's murder. Furthermore, I have an alibi of my own.
Phoenix:
An alibi?! Seriously?!
Judge:
Ha ha ha ha! It seems the testimony the defense had been hoping for is working against him. Now Abbot Inmee, your testimony, if you please.
Tahrust:
Yes, yes of course.
Witness Testimony-- I Have an Alibi --
Tahrust:
I have an ironclad alibi for the time during which the murder took place.
Just past noon on the day before the rite, I was entertaining guests at my home.
And I believe my guests can corroborate this.
Phoenix:
You had guests? (Just past noon... That's right about the time Zeh'lot was murdered!) Are you sure about that?
Tahrust:
Absolutely.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, Rayfa told me about a spirit's memory...)
Rayfa:
A spirit's memory is cut off at the moment of death.
Phoenix:
So even a spirit that is brought back after centuries doesn't sense any gap in time... ...between the moment of its death, and the moment it is channeled?
Rayfa:
Yes, and yet, it clearly recalls all of the memories it had in life.
Phoenix:
(The high priest seems to know exactly what he's talking about. So, the question is, what would be the best angle of attack?)
Cross-Examination-- I Have an Alibi --
Tahrust:
I have an ironclad alibi for the time during which the murder took place.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You used the word alibi as if it were second nature.
Tahrust:
Hrrrmmm... Are you, perhaps, mocking me? Or is it, perhaps, the Kingdom of Khura'in itself you wish to ridicule?
Gallery:
C'mon! Everyone and their grandma knows what alibi means!We're not a bunch of country bumpkins here! We have plenty of courtroom dramas on TV!
Judge:
Peace, peace! Peace, I say! Mr. Wright, would you care to clarify your last statement?
Phoenix:
P-Please! Don't take it the wrong way! It's just, alibi is a rather technical term for a priest to use so naturally.
Tahrust:
I assure you, I know how to use the term. In fact, I had even hoped for a chance to do so one day. I suppose that even I, a high priest, am not immune to such trivial worldly attachments.
Phoenix:
O-Oh, I see... (Still, he seems unusually calm and composed. It's almost as if he had prepped himself for something like this...)
Tahrust:
Just past noon on the day before the rite, I was entertaining guests at my home. 
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Guests...? And you were entertaining them personally?
Tahrust:
That I was. We gathered around the table for a most enjoyable conversation.
Phoenix:
(He said his guests could corroborate his alibi. That can't be good for our case.)
Phoenix:
Are you sure that was the same day as the murder? Maybe you've misremembered.
Tahrust:
KAAAAAAAH! Do not doubt my mnemonic faculties! I may have died, but my memories up to that point are crystal clear!
Phoenix:
S-Sorry...  (...He's pretty thin-skinned for a priest. Though, I guess I should've known better than to doubt his memory...)
Rayfa:
A spirit's memory is cut off at the moment of death.
Phoenix:
So even a spirit that is brought back after centuries doesn't sense any gap in time... ...between the moment of its death, and the moment it is channeled?
Rayfa:
Yes, and yet, it clearly recalls all of the memories it had in life.
Tahrust:
Ahh... There's nothing better than enjoying gingihl cuisine with dear friends. That way, everyone's breath becomes equally malodorous!
Phoenix:
Right...
Tahrust:
And I believe my guests can corroborate this.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
And who exactly were your guests that day? Don't tell me they were rebels, so they can't be called here to testify...
Tahrust:
It was none other than His Magistry, along with his family. He couldn't attend the rite due to work, so he stopped by ahead of time. My my, how his daughter has grown.
Phoenix:
...Wait a second.
Judge:
Let me set the record straight right now. I am NOT a rebel. Thank you for that wonderful meal, Abbot Inmee. Lady Inmee's cooking simply cannot be beat!
Tahrust:
...So there you have it.
Phoenix:
When exactly was His Magistry at your home?
Tahrust:
He was there from 2 PM to 3 PM. Indeed, precisely the time period within which Acolyte Zeh'lot was slain.
Judge:
Yes, and we had a rousing chat concerning the game of Kachu'demahl.
Phoenix:
B-But...!
Judge:
I'll just have that added to the testimony. After all, it was I who visited the high priest's home.
Add statement:
"My guests that day were His Magistry and his family. They visited from 2 PM to 3 PM."
Tahrust:
My guests that day were His Magistry and his family. They visited from 2 PM to 3 PM.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Y-Your Magistry, are you sure this testimony is completely accurate?
Judge:
As sure as sure can be! Oh, how wonderful it is to finally have my actions be admissible as evidence in court!
Tahrust:
His Magistry was at my home during the exact time period of the murder. Come, let us put this behind us. I could not have possibly committed this crime.
Phoenix:
How can you be so sure? What if the clock or watch you were using was off, or you misread the time?
Judge:
There was a clock right near the table, and it had the exact same time as my watch.
Tahrust:
Now do you understand, lawyer?
Phoenix:
How am I going to attack his alibi? Maya, what do you... Oh, right... She's kind of busy right now.
Tahrust:
What? Is there something on my face? Hrrrmm?
Phoenix:
N-No, not at all! (I'll just have to start chipping away at that statement about his alibi.)
After pressing all statements:
Tahrust:
As you can see, my alibi is airtight. Or do you still think I could have killed Acolyte Zeh'lot?
Phoenix:
Argh...! (His Magistry's a witness?!)
Nahyuta:
Are you satisfied now? There is not a single discrepancy in Abbot Inmee's alibi.
Phoenix:
(I-If I give up now, it's all over!) N-Now hold on a second! (Is there something, ANYTHING wrong with the high priest's testimony?)
There is
Leads to:
"There IS a discrepancy in the high priest's testimony!"
There isn't
Phoenix:
Wait... Never mind.
Nahyuta:
I thought as much. After all, there can be no killer other than the accused.
Judge:
Indeed. And therefore, I see no need to continue these proceedings.
Phoenix:
(Do I really want to give up now? If I do, Maya will be found guilty. Was there really not a single thing wrong with the high priest's testimony?) Please, Your Magistry, wait.
Leads to:
"There IS a discrepancy in the high priest's testimony!"
Phoenix:
There IS a discrepancy in the high priest's testimony!
Judge:
There is? Well then, perhaps you could explain what it might be.
Phoenix:
This is what was wrong with his testimony.
The prayer feast was short
Phoenix:
The meal was too short to be a Feast of Blessings celebration.
Nahyuta:
The length of the feast is of no consequence. Besides, Lady Inmee's testimony regarding the feast was the same as her husband's. Or would you suggest Abbot Inmee and his wife are lying?
Judge:
Hmm. I see no problem as you allege.
Phoenix:
Oops... I guess I'm wrong then.
Judge:
It seems there is nothing wrong with Abbot Inmee's testimony.
Phoenix:
I beg to differ. There IS a problem! A big one!
Leads back to:
"This is what was wrong with his testimony."
He's too friendly with the judge
Phoenix:
He's way too friendly with you, Your Magistry. Are you two perhaps, more than just friends?
Judge:
M-M-Mr. Wright! What on earth are you suggesting?!
Phoenix:
You seem awfully flustered, Your Magistry.  That seems kind of suspicious.
Tahrust:
You are free to think anything you like about our relationship. But it has nothing to do with the case at hand.
Judge:
I concur! Now, I believe you know what comes next.
Phoenix:
Guess I got a little carried away there...)
Judge:
It seems there is nothing wrong with Abbot Inmee's testimony.
Phoenix:
I beg to differ. There IS a problem! A big one!
Leads back to:
"This is what was wrong with his testimony."
He knew the time of the crime
Leads to:
"After Abbot Inmee was channeled..."
Phoenix:
After Abbot Inmee was channeled... ...no one ever stated what time Acolyte Zeh'lot was murdered!
Judge:
N-Now that you mention it...!
Phoenix:
Despite that, you claim to have an alibi from 2 PM to 3 PM. That means you knew that Acolyte Zeh'lot was dead... ...when you were still alive!
Tahrust:
Haaargh!
Phoenix:
(Wait... I think I saw something just now... No, I must be imagining things.) So, tell me, how did you know what time the crime had been committed?
Tahrust:
Ummm... About that... Hrrrmmmmmm... HRRRRNH! ...Open your heart! Let the Holy Mother in!
Judge:
Wh-Why! We've been blessed with the high priest's sacred words of prayer!
Tahrust:
All who serve Her Holiness must strive to banish worldly desires from their soul! Open your heart! Let the Holy Mother in! Purge your mind of greed and bias!
Judge:
I feel as if my very soul has been cleansed!
Phoenix:
You can't fool me! Prayer may banish worldly desires, but it can't make a contradiction disappear!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
How can you be so sure?
Phoenix:
(What's that supposed to mean?)
Nahyuta:
This lawyer seems to think little of the power of Khura'inist prayer.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Abbot Inmee was at home during the crime, but knew of what happened at the hideout. I believe this can be explained thusly... He must have had a way to monitor the hideout from his home.
Phoenix:
What?!
Tahrust:
..................  Y-You never cease to amaze, Prosecutor. As he has surmised, there was a listening device installed at the hideout. It enabled me to instantly learn of anything unusual, even when I was not there.
Nahyuta:
Remember, the rebels had been using this as a top-secret hideout. It would be perfectly natural for them to install such an apparatus.
Phoenix:
(Wait, come to think of it, when I was searching the rebel hideout...)
Phoenix:
Hm? (There's something under the banner. A microphone? What's this doing here? Was someone trying to record something with it?)
Phoenix:
(That was a listening device...?)
Tahrust:
It starts recording whenever it detects movement. And I heard just such a recording after His Magistry and his family left. If you look in the desk in my study, you will find the tape in question.
Judge:
All right, then... Bailiff!
Bailiff:
Yes, Your Magistry!
Judge:
Go retrieve the tape in question from the high priest's home.
Bailiff:
At once, Your Magistry!
Nahyuta:
The power of Khura'inist prayer... Even a putrid brain such as yours should understand it now.
Phoenix:
(It's like the contradiction really did vanish.)
Judge:
We shall ascertain the content of the recording once we have the tape. In the meantime, I would ask Abbot Inmee to continue with his testimony.
Tahrust:
Very well.
Witness Testimony-- I Heard Everything --
Tahrust:
I was entertaining His Magistry and his family when the crime occurred.
When I listened to the tape later, I heard a man and a woman quarreling.
It sounded like an altercation between Acolyte Zeh'lot and Acolyte Fey.
After that, there was a loud noise, followed by haunting silence.
Phoenix:
(I have to find some way to attack his alibi. If only Maya were here... She has a way of putting me at ease. But seeing her like this is only creeping me out!)
Nahyuta:
Though the high priest was a rebel, he was still a Khura'inist holy man. Therefore, take care in your questioning, lest you invoke the ire of our people.
Gallery:
How dare he suspect the high priest! May the Holy Mother strike him blind.
Phoenix:
(As if this wasn't hard enough already...) Nice try, but I'll stop at nothing to find the truth!

Tahrust:
Indeed. My wife Beh'leeb was treating them to her wonderful home cooking.
Phoenix:
Your wife was there that day?
Tahrust:
Why yes. She was in the kitchen cooking up a storm the entire time.
Judge: 
Come to think of it, I don't think I saw her at all that day.
Tahrust:
She takes her culinary duties most seriously, you see. That is why she was in the kitchen cooking without pause the entire day.
Phoenix:
(So, the judge never saw Mrs. Inmee? Should I have Abbot Inmee add that statement to his testimony?)
Have him add it
Phoenix:
Please add that statement to your testimony.
Tahrust:
As you wish!
Adds statement "My wife Beh'leeb was in the kitchen cooking the entire time."
Leave it alone
Phoenix:
(I doubt Mrs. Inmee has anything to do with this case.) Please continue with your testimony, Abbot Inmee.
Tahrust:
After His Magistry left, I listened to the tape recorded via the listening device.
Leads back to cross-examination
Tahrust:
My wife Beh'leeb was in the kitchen cooking the entire time.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
What was your wife making that day?
Tahrust:
The menu that day featured "hahtin'supaise" and "mehl'tenmoht". They are both traditional Khura'inese dishes.
Phoenix:
(I can't even begin to imagine what those are...)
Judge: 
Ahhhh, yes! The exquisite zest of hahtin'supaise and the supreme texture of mehl'tenmoht! Lady Inmee's cooking that day was utterly unforgettable!
Tahrust:
Thank you! It brings me great joy to know you enjoyed your meal. Now, once His Magistry and his family had left...
After pressing all other statements
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Wright. Do you still feel the need to question the high priest? His alibi is as tight as tight can be.
Phoenix:
(This isn't going so well. I'd better ask him about something else.) ...I'm curious, Abbot Inmee. Did you stop by the rebel hideout after His Magistry left?
Tahrust:
...Yes. I thought it would be wise to assess the situation. But as I said before, there was nothing to see. The hideout appeared as it always had.
Phoenix:
And the victim's body...?
Tahrust:
It was nowhere to be found. Acolyte Fey must have already disposed of it, and anything else incriminating.
Phoenix:
So,  when you saw the rebel hideout... ...it looked like it does in this photo?
Tahrust:
Hrrm... Yes, I would say that is how it appeared that day.
Phoenix:

Tahrust:
Indeed! Each night, I would secretly check what the listening device had recorded. I would've been in serious trouble with my lovely wife had she discovered my secret.

Can you really tell what happened by the audio alone?
Tahrust:
Long years of ascetic training have sharpened my hearing. It is but a simple matter for me to ascertain a situation by the sounds I hear.
Phoenix:
P-Practicing Khura'inism improves your hearing?
Tahrust:
Hearing is but one of the senses it can improve. If one can focus and attain inner peace, all five senses can be sharpened. ...Why, the warbaa'd over in the bazaar just cried. Did you not hear it?

Mr. Wright. Is it not time to concede defeat?

Hmm. If you insist...

It sounded like an altercation between Acolyte Zeh'lot and Acolyte Fey.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Hold on. Are you sure about those voices? Was it really Acolyte Zeh'lot and Ms. Fey?
Tahrust:
I'd say that was the most reasonable conclusion under the circumstances. Or perhaps Acolyte Fey has an alibi that you can prove?
Phoenix:
Umm... I-I'm afraid not.
Tahrust:
Then I suggest you make like a mollusk, and clam up! Now, I will continue my testimony if I may.
After pressing all other statements
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Wright. Do you still feel the need to question the high priest? His alibi is as tight as tight can be.
Phoenix:
(This isn't going so well. I'd better ask him about something else.) ...I'm curious, Abbot Inmee. Did you stop by the rebel hideout after His Magistry left?
Tahrust:
...Yes. I thought it would be wise to assess the situation. But as I said before, there was nothing to see. The hideout appeared as it always had.
Phoenix:
And the victim's body...?
Tahrust:
It was nowhere to be found. Acolyte Fey must have already disposed of it, and anything else incriminating.
Phoenix:
So,  when you saw the rebel hideout... ...it looked like it does in this photo?
Tahrust:
Hrrm... Yes, I would say that is how it appeared that day.

A loud noise? I'd say that's worth looking into.
Tahrust:
It was a terrible crashing sound. Poor Acolyte Zeh'lot...  It must have felt so heavy.
Phoenix:
(It must've been the sound of that stone slab falling over.) (Should I have him add that statement to his testimony?)
Have him add it
Phoenix:
Please add that statement to your testimony.
Tahrust:
As you wish.
Adds statement "I would describe the noise as a terrible crash. Poor Zeh'lot... It must have felt so heavy."
Leave it alone
Phoenix:
(It's probably not that important.)
Leads back to cross-examination
Tahrust:
I would describe the noise as a terrible crash. Poor Zeh'lot... It must have felt so heavy.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You believe that terrible crash is connected to Acolyte Zeh'lot's death?
Tahrust:
Yes, the sound, no doubt, was poor Zeh'lot's death knell. Such a tragedy, for he was a fine disciple. I would ask all here today to give a prayer for his departed soul. Zuh'shiray matahmee yomah!

Phoenix:
(So, all he knows about the crime is what he heard on the tape? And he was with His Magistry and his family at the time.)
Tahrust:
Now that I have proven the soundness of my alibi... ...I believe it is about time for me to return to the Twilight Realm.
Phoenix:
Wh-What's the rush? Why not enjoy some more time among the living?! (I better find a way to attack his alibi soon. I'll just have to press harder and hope something useful comes out.)
After pressing all statements
Phoenix:
(I doubt there's much more testimony I could wring out of him by pressing. And I can tell the judge is growing impatient. There have been some changes in both the testimony and the evidence. That means there could very well be an inconsistency somewhere. I've got to find it -- before he returns to the Twilight Realm!)
Phoenix:
Abbot Inmee, you said, and I quote: "Poor Zeh'lot... It must have felt so heavy."
Tahrust:
..................
Phoenix:
Why do you think he felt something heavy? You said the hideout looked like it did in this photo. If so, there's nothing that would lead you to believe he had experienced a heavy feeling.
Tahrust:
..................
Phoenix:
The fact is, of course, a stone slab did fall over onto Acolyte Zeh'lot... ...impaling him on the warbaa'd statue behind him. But that was only revealed through Her Benevolence's Divination Séance earlier.
Judge:
Hmm. Would the defense please get to the point?
Phoenix:
My point is, simply hearing a crashing sound... ...shouldn't have automatically led him to conclude the victim was crushed to death.
Judge:
I still don't see your point.
Phoenix:
I'm saying that the high priest knew. He knew how the victim was really killed!
Judge:
Why...!
Phoenix:
And that is information only the real killer could've known!
Tahrust:
!
Phoenix:
(I-I definitely saw it that time! I've got the high priest's spirit shaking in his boots -- or should I say, sandals!)
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Need I remind you Abbot Inmee was with His Magistry at the time of the crime. Such an alibi precludes him from being the killer!
Phoenix:
(That's true. So he can't be the killer. However, he knew how Zeh'lot was killed -- something only the killer could know. Can this discrepancy be resolved somehow?)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright?! We're waiting for an explanation!
Phoenix:
...I was just getting to that. (Time to think of something quick!) The high priest knew something only the killer could've known because...
He heard it during the trial
Phoenix:
He heard it during this trial.
Judge:
How could that be? The true cause of death came to light before Abbot Inmee came back to this world.
Phoenix:
Oh... Umm, well then maybe...
Judge:
Let me stop you right there before you waste any more time with your inane excuses.
Phoenix:
(Guess I couldn't have wiggle my way out of that one.)
Judge:
If you're going to make such a bold claim, I insist you back it up.
Phoenix:
Don't worry, I'm going to do just that.
Leads back to:
"The high priest knew something only the killer could've known because..."
He inferred it after the fact
Phoenix:
Maybe he figured it out later. After all, we figured it out. He could have, too!
Tahrust:
W-Why, yes, it is as the lawyer says.
Judge:
Hmm. You are stating the obvious... and negating your own point, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Oh, umm... Oops? L-Let's pretend that never happened!
Judge:
Then you shouldn't have brought it up in the first place!
Phoenix:
(Urk! Now I'm really on His Magistry's bad side.)
Judge:
If you're going to make such a bold claim, I insist you back it up.
Phoenix:
Don't worry, I'm going to do just that.
Leads back to:
"The high priest knew something only the killer could've known because..."
He heard it from the real culprit
Leads to:
"He must've heard how the victim died from... "
Phoenix:
He must've heard how the victim died from... umm... ...from the real killer!
Tahrust:
Hrrrrrrrrmm? The real killer?
Phoenix:
(Of course! That makes perfect sense. I don't want to believe it, but this is the only possible explanation.)
Judge:
So, tell us! Who is this real killer?!

(That was pretty sloppy. The high priest has an ironclad alibi. But was there someone who didn't?)
Judge:
I expect a serious answer this time, defense. Who do you believe is the real killer?!
Leads back to:
"(The person most likely to be Zeh'lot's killer is...!)"
Phoenix:
Your Magistry, while you were visiting the high priest's home... ...you didn't see Mrs. Inmee at all, did you?
Judge:
No,  I never saw her, but... Wh-What does that have to do with anything?
Phoenix:
Did the high priest ever leave your sight?
Judge:
No, we were talking the entire time. And the food was brought right to the room's entryway.
Phoenix:
So, the high priest has an ironclad alibi. But his wife does not!
Nahyuta:
What the devil are you insinuating?
Phoenix:
I'm insinuating that Mrs. Inmee might have killed Acolyte Zeh'lot!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
You have a lot of nerve, making such a baseless allegation. She had no motive to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot. He was like family to her.
Phoenix:
No... We can't entirely discount the idea. Especially if you consider that... ...Mrs. Inmee could've been the one posing as Lady Kee'ra.
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Even a fool must temper his foolishness at times. Or do you truly believe Lady Kee'ra would kill Acolyte Zeh'lot, though he was not a rebel?
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
As we all know, the high priest was secretly a rebel! It would follow that his favorite disciple could very well be a rebel, too!
Judge:
A-Are you suggesting that Mrs. Inmee killed her husband, as well?
Phoenix:
As sad as it is to think she'd kill her own husband to rid the kingdom of rebels... ...I don't think we can rule it out.
Tahrust:
Tahrust:
............... KAAAAAAAAAH!
Phoenix:
Urk!
Judge:
Yikes!
Tahrust:
You claim my wife is that rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra? And that she slew both Zeh'lot and myself? My lovely wife?! That is utterly impossible! KAAAAAAAAAH!
Phoenix:
Urk!
Judge:
Yikes! I have never seen the high priest so angry!
Nahyuta:
It is as Abbot Inmee stated. And the accused has already been found guilty of his murder. It is far too late to overturn it.
Judge:
Th-That's right, Mr. Wright! N-Now apologize to the good priest before he gets angry again! Quickly now!
Phoenix:
No, I'm not going to apologize! The true identity of Lady Kee'ra is a major piece to this trial's puzzle! Admit it, Abbot Inmee -- your wife, Lady Inmee, killed you. Yet even now, you continue to lie in an effort to protect her.
Tahrust:
Tahrust:
How absurd! It appears the lawyer has forgotten. My lovely wife could not possibly battle the rebels in the guise of Lady Kee'ra. For we were blessed by Her Holiness and she is with child! Praise be to the Holy Mother!
Phoenix:
(Ack, I completely forgot about that.)
Tahrust:
That abominable Lady Kee'ra figure who slew me and Acolyte Zeh'lot was the accused!
Phoenix:
(This is bad, but I can't give up now!) D-Don't forget! My client doesn't have the strength to fight rebels, either!
Tahrust:

How could a weak young woman like her possibly...
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
You foolish oaf of a lawyer. If only you were as blessed as Lady Inmee.
Phoenix:
What?
Nahyuta:
Surely, the accused possesses the strength -- or should I say, the power. ...The power to battle those black-hearted rebels.
Phoenix:
Wh-What are you talking about?
Tahrust:
...My good prosecutor, I see you have come to the same conclusion as I. Such keen insight!
Nahyuta:
Then you have figured it out as well, Abbot Inmee? May I ask you to explain it to this putrid-brained lawyer?
Tahrust:
Certainly. For I cannot allow him to frame my lovely wife for murder! Foreign devil! Your Magistry, allow me to testify as to how Maya Fey is that murderous Lady Kee'ra!
Judge:
W-Well, if it would assuage your anger... ...then by all means, please testify!
Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey is Lady Kee'ra --
Tahrust:
Acolyte Fey channeled Lady Kee'ra's spirit.
She is a spirit medium who knows Lady Kee'ra's true name, so she could have done it.
So, it was the real Lady Kee'ra who returned to root out the rebels among us.
She attacked and killed me with a strength far beyond any mortal woman.
Phoenix:
B-But...
Nahyuta:
Do you understand now? Murder by spirit channeling explains everything. This is the only way the accused could have defeated one rebel after another!
Tahrust:
Indeed, I am a living... or shall I say "dead" proof of her terrible power.
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaaagh! (Maya's ability to channel spirits... It's come back to haunt her!)
Nahyuta:
Now, is it not time to let it go, and move on, defense?
Phoenix:
No, never! I'll never give up! (Now what? Think, think...! How can I prove that Maya couldn't have channeled Lady Kee'ra?!)

Argh... B-But you've no proof she actually channeled Lady Kee'ra.

Oh, but I do.

She is a spirit medium who knows Lady Kee'ra's true name, so she could have done it.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
While it's true she may be capable of channeling Lady Kee'ra... ...I doubt there's any proof she actually did.
Tahrust:
We are talking about the infamous "rebel hunter" here. That modern-day Lady Kee'ra has captured many a rebel all by herself. And among them have been more than a few great warriors.  Who but the real Lady Kee'ra could have accomplished such a feat?
Judge:
...Hmm, it would be difficult for a mere mortal. That leaves the real Lady Kee'ra of legend as the only likely answer.
Tahrust:
Indeed! Is this not proof enough that the real Lady Kee'ra of legend had been channeled?
Phoenix:
(The real Lady Kee'ra of legend. That's an oxymoron if I ever heard one. Then again, the people of Khura'in believe legends to be true.)

Lady Kee'ra is an actual person? Do you really believe there ever was a woman that powerful? One capable of battling rebels much bigger and stronger than herself?
Tahrust:
There is no way to prove that. But to doubt the existence of Lady Kee'ra is to doubt Khura'inism itself. It is not for us to question. We must simply believe.
Gallery:
Yeah! How dare you doubt our legends?!You'll regret saying that, you pohlkunan! Lady Kee'ra's gonna strike you down!

A strength far beyond any mortal woman? And just how strong would that be?
Tahrust:
You need but look at the wound she inflicted upon my body. ...Though I had hoped to never have to think about that again.
Phoenix:
Your wound...? (It was pretty deep, and there was a tremendous amount of blood.)
Tahrust:
And while Acolyte Zeh'lot was rather small in stature, he was strong. Nevertheless, he was no match for the sheer strength of Lady Kee'ra.
Phoenix:
(Maya's spirit channeling is proof that she's Lady Kee'ra? This is not good! I'll have to prove she didn't channel the original Lady Kee'ra!)
Phoenix:
The Tome of Secrets is only given to the priestess who performs the Purification Rite. Is this your proof that my client could have channeled Lady Kee'ra?
Tahrust:
Yes, indeed! For it contains the true name of Lady Kee'ra, a secret only revealed within!
Phoenix:
Abbot Inmee... I'm afraid you're mistaken. This couldn't have been used to channel Lady Kee'ra.
Tahrust:
What nonsense?!

Oh, umm... nothing, as far as I can tell.
Judge:
Well, as far as I can tell, this has everything to do with a penalty.
Phoenix:
(I know the answer's here somewhere. I just need to remember the requirements for spirit channeling.)
Judge:
It seems there can be no doubt that the accused channeled Lady Kee'ra.
Phoenix:
No, she couldn't have!
Leads back to:
"This is why my client couldn't have channeled Lady Kee'ra!"
Phoenix:
Lady Kee'ra's face is hidden behind a mask in the Tome of Secrets! You need both a name and a face to channel a spirit!
Tahrust:
...It can't be!
Phoenix:
Without a face... ...it would've been impossible for my client to channel Lady Kee'ra!
Judge:
Oh, my!
Phoenix:
Therefore, the claim that she became Lady Kee'ra by means of spirit channeling... ...is patently false!
Nahyuta:
Gah!
Phoenix:
And with Lady Kee'ra out of the equation, my client had no motive to commit murder!
Judge:
B-But then... ...who is the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra we've been reading about in the paper?!
Nahyuta:
Yes, who is this other suspect, if indeed there is one at all? Let us hear the defense's brilliant deduction!
Phoenix:
(Think, THINK! The true identity of Lady Kee'ra is the key to solving both murders! I thought Mrs. Inmee was suspicious, but her pregnancy takes her out of the running. And Mr. Are'bal is a rebel, so that doesn't make sense. That leaves us with... Hmm...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, you have that look again. The one where you know you have to say something, but you can't figure out what it is.
Phoenix:
(This is my chance to really turn up the heat. I'll just have to stir the pot till something floats to the top!) Your Magistry, I know who's been posing as the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra!

Judge:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! These may be tears of laughter, but rest assured there is no mirth here for you.

(This is no laughing matter! Let's think about that again. Who could be posing as Lady Kee'ra? If I cross off all the unlikely suspects, there's only one name left on the list!)

Khura'inism teaches us to be merciful, so in that spirit I am giving you another chance. Who do you believe is posing as Lady Kee'ra?
Leads back to:

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Magistry. I whittled down the list of suspects until there was only one left.

But a process of elimination is not the same as solid evidence. I assume you have evidence to back up your claim?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, of course! (I will have some in a moment, that is. At least, I hope so... Maya wasn't Lady Kee'ra, and neither was Mrs. Inmee or any of the other possibilities.

Well, here's your answer!

Now then, I will ask the defense once more. What proof do you have that the victim himself was Lady Kee'ra?
Leads back to:
"The evidence that proves Acolyte Zeh'lot was posing as Lady Kee'ra is this!"
Phoenix:
This is what proves that Acolyte Zeh'lot was Lady Kee'ra: Lady Kee'ra's warning letter!
Nahyuta:
How absurd! What could that possibly prove?!
Phoenix:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. You stated that this warning letter proved that my client was Lady Kee'ra. And the reason you gave was that the high priest's house was locked tight. But there was another member of the family who lived there.
Nahyuta:
...Ah!
Phoenix:
Therefore, Acolyte Zeh'lot could have delivered the warning anytime he wanted!
Gallery:
...What is he talking about? That's just not possible!
Tahrust:
...............
Nahyuta:
Are you saying Lady Kee'ra was not the culprit, but rather the victim?!
Phoenix:
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Judge:
B-But...! That would... That would overturn the entire premise of this case! This trial has proceeded on the assumption Lady Kee'ra was behind the serial killings. But if Lady Kee'ra is one of the victims... ...who was the killer, and what was their motive?!
Phoenix:
(The only suspect left is Mrs. Inmee. And there's only one possible motive!) What if Mrs. Inmee is a rebel?
Judge:
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
Tahrust:
Fiend! You're still bent on casting suspicion upon my lovely wife?! Blasphemer! You have no evidence of this! Repent for the mistrust in your soul! 
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Well, you have no evidence, either. After all, the dagger with my client's prints on it wasn't what killed Acolyte Zeh'lot. And the Plumed Punisher theme that he heard could have been an alarm clock. That means all of the evidence linking her to the crime have been called into question!
Tahrust:
Hrrrrrngh!
Judge:
Hmm... Was Lady Inmee a rebel, and did she pose as Lady Kee'ra to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot? Or was Acolyte Zeh'lot a rebel, and was the accused the Lady Kee'ra who killed him? I would say either scenario is just as likely. ...What are we to do now?
Tahrust:
Tahrust:
The alarm clock, you say...? Do you mean the one in the rebel hideout?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, but what of it?
Tahrust:
Heh heh heh heh heh. So that's it... Heh heh... Heh heh heh heh heh.
Phoenix:

Tahrust:
Ho ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! HA HA HA HA HA!
Judge:
A-Abbot Inmee! Just what is so comical?!
Tahrust:
Forgive my outburst... That has simply tickled my funny bone.
Phoenix:
What did?
Tahrust:
The theme song came from the Plumed Punisher clock, you say? ...Hmph! That alarm could not possibly have gone off.
Phoenix:
Wh-What makes you say that? The clock was working just fine the last time I checked!
Tahrust:
Try using your head for a change. Would not the existence of a secret hideout be given away if an alarm kept going off?
Phoenix:
Wait, you don't mean...
Tahrust:
Indeed! We leave the alarm switched off at all times!
Phoenix:
N-Nooooooooooooooo!
Judge:
I-In that case...
Tahrust:
I am sad to say that the defense's claim does not hold water!
Judge:
Would you care to respond, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Oh, umm... (This can't be happening. Not now...)
Nahyuta:
This should put an end to the lawyer's futile struggles. The theme song the victim heard was from the accused's strap, just as we suspected. Therefore, the accused is the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra, and the victim's killer.
Phoenix:
(I need an opening. Something I can raise an objection to.)
Tahrust:
That Plumed Punisher theme song Acolyte Zeh'lot heard in his final moments... I, too, heard it by way of the listening device.
Phoenix:
B-But did you really? If you had heard it, why didn't you testify to the fact before?!
Tahrust:
Is it not obvious?! I did not know such a tune could become a key matter of dispute. 
Judge:
Yes, the matter of the theme song came up before Abbot Inmee was channeled.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Well then, umm... What if he's lying about the clock's alarm being switched off?
Tahrust:
Miserable wretch! That would be a pointless lie -- one easily disproven!
Nahyuta:
If you check the clock, you will see that the alarm is, in fact, switched off.
Phoenix:
(Argh... Come to think of it...)
Rayfa:
Hmm... What a fine item. And this switch...If I'm right... 
Phoenix:
(We set the switch back into the off position before we left.)
Tahrust:
I remember hearing it clearly. Those distinctive taiko drums in the intro are etched in my mind. They went... Daka don-don-don, don-don-don-don!
Phoenix:
...Distinctive taiko drums in the intro?
Judge:
...This trial has gone on far too long. Shall we move ahead to the verdict phase now?
Nahyuta:
By all means. And let us also return Abbot Inmee's spirit to the Twilight Realm.
Tahrust:
Before I go, let me say a word to my darling wife... 
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
N-Now hold on just one minute! ...Your Magistry!
Judge:
Yes?
Phoenix:
The high priest's statement is inconsistent with a certain piece of evidence!
Judge:
It is?!
Tahrust:
Still you writhe in defiance of your fate? The very sight reminds me of a tortured soul,  writhing in flames! 
Phoenix:
You won't be saying that once I show you the evidence. (Now, all I have to do is pick the right one! This piece of evidence is inconsistent with that statement about the taiko drum intro!)

Leads to:
"This is what's inconsistent with his statement."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This evidence is inconsistent with your statement, if you get my drift!
Judge:
..................  Alas, I am afraid your "drift" is lost on me.
Phoenix:
Is it, now? (Did I get it wrong?)
Judge:
The defense is up to his usual tricks again.
Tahrust:
Then let us whip him into shape!
Judge:
Ha ha ha ha! By all means, Abbot Inmee! Please do the honors!
Tahrust:
Open your heart!  Let the Holy Mother in! KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
Phoenix:
(What if I refuse...? Now, what was the high priest's exact statement again?)
Tahrust:
I remember hearing it clearly. Those distinctive taiko drums in the intro are etched in my mind. They went... Daka don-don-don, don-don-don-don!
Phoenix:
Please! Let me try that again!
Leads back to:
"(This piece of evidence is inconsistent with that statement about the taiko drum intro!)"
Phoenix:
This is what's inconsistent with his statement. ...My client's Plumed Punisher strap.
Tahrust:
What does that have to do with anything?
Phoenix:
It plays the Plumed Punisher theme song. And here it is! The theme to "The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm"! Do you see what I mean? The music the victim heard in his final moments... ...might not have been the Plumed Punisher theme song!
Judge:
Hm? I'm afraid I am not following you. What was it if not the Plumed Punisher theme?
Phoenix:
In his final moments, Acolyte Zeh'lot heard...
The prayers of the people
Phoenix:
People praying!
Nahyuta:
Are you suggesting they were praying to the beat of the Plumed Punisher theme?
Tahrust:
No one would do such a thing in the holiest of holy Inner Sanctum.
Judge:
Yes, I have never heard of anything so absurd.
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, me neither... (The high priest heard a distinctive taiko drum intro. But the Plumed Punisher theme doesn't feature taiko drums.)
Judge:
It's clear now. The victim did indeed hear the Plumed Punisher theme in his final moments.
Phoenix:
No, Your Magistry. That's not what he heard.
Leads back to:
"In his final moments, Acolyte Zeh'lot heard..."
The song for the Dance of Devotion
Phoenix:
It was the music from the Dance of Devotion coming from the temple!
Tahrust:
I distinctly heard the Plumed Punisher theme. Or are you suggesting the music for the Dance of Devotion... ...has been changed to the Plumed Punisher theme?
Judge:
Do not make light of our religious traditions, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Ack... I didn't mean any harm, honest. (The high priest heard a distinctive taiko drum intro. But the Plumed Punisher theme doesn't feature taiko drums.)
Judge:
It's clear now. The victim did indeed hear the Plumed Punisher theme in his final moments.
Phoenix:
No, Your Magistry. That's not what he heard.
Leads back to:
"In his final moments, Acolyte Zeh'lot heard..."
The Steel Samurai theme
Leads to:
"There are no taiko drums in the intro of the Plumed Punisher theme!"
Phoenix:
There are no taiko drums in the intro of the Plumed Punisher theme! So what Acolyte Zeh'lot actually heard in his final moments was...  ...the theme of "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo"!
Judge:
Peace, peace! Peace, I say! ...Mr. Wright. What is this Steel Samurai of which you speak?
Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo is an action-hero show from America! The Plumed Punisher theme is a total rip-- Err... I mean,  is very similar to it. If you didn't know about The Steel Samurai, you could easily mistake the two.
Tahrust:
But the fact that Acolyte Zeh'lot heard music from an American action-hero show... ...is irrefutable evidence that the accused was in the secret hideout!
Phoenix:
Actually, no. You have it backwards.
Tahrust:
B-Backwards...?
Phoenix:
That's right. Ms. Fey met an avid Plumed Punisher fan here in Khura'in. And as a token of their friendship... ...she traded a certain Steel Samurai item she had for the Plumed Punisher strap.
Tahrust:
Hrrrmmmm?
Judge:
And this avid Plumed Punisher fan... ...was the one who killed Acolyte Zeh'lot?!
Phoenix:
Yes. And that avid fan is none other than the high priest's wife, Beh'leeb Inmee!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Do you have evidence to back up this claim, Mr. Wright? For as forgiving as the Holy Mother is... ...I doubt she would tolerate yet another dose of your baseless slander. I suggest you prepare yourself to face Her Holiness's wrath.
Phoenix:
Oh, I'm prepared. ...To turn this entire case upside-down, that is! (This is my last chance! I better take a deep breath and review the evidence.)
Judge:
Very well, then. Please present your evidence, if you would, defense.
Phoenix:
The evidence that proves Mrs. Inmee was the one who killed Acolyte Zeh'lot is this!
Present Family Photo
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"It's right here in this family photo!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Do you see this piece of evidence?! What Steel Samurai fan or fanatic wouldn't be tickled pink to have one of these?!
Nahyuta:
We are neither Steel Samurai fans, nor fanatics. You would not be using this nonsense as a means to befuddle us, would you?
Phoenix:
...Saw right through that, did you?
Judge:
Mr. Wright... I have warned you before. Keep this up, and I really WILL have your tongue plucked out!
Maximum penalty
Phoenix:
It's right here in this family photo! Proof that Mrs. Inmee and Ms. Fey traded items featuring their favorite characters!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
A family photo?! And what exactly should we be looking at here?
Phoenix:
The proof that they exchanged items featuring their favorite characters is right here!
Present Steel Samurai watch
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Look at Mrs. Inmee's left wrist."
Present anywhere else
Judge:
Hmm... So, THAT is the Steel Samurai you've been going on about?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, that's definitely it!
Nahyuta:
That is the Steel Samurai? But there is nothing even remotely samurai-like about it!
Phoenix:
Ack!
Judge:
Did you think to fool us because we lack knowledge of that show?!
Phoenix:
(I should've known better than to try and fool Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Okay. Something bearing the Steel Samurai's likeness should be in that family photo. And that will prove that Mrs. Inmee and Maya made a trade!)
Leads back to:
"The proof that they exchanged items featuring their favorite characters is right here!"
Phoenix:
Look at Mrs. Inmee's left wrist. You can see The Steel Samurai's trademark topknot right there!
Tahrust:
...............
Phoenix:
Which clearly makes this a Steel Samurai watch!
Tahrust:
Hargh!
Judge:
Why, I never knew your wife had such hobbies, Abbot Inmee!
Phoenix:
This family photo was taken right before Acolyte Zeh'lot was murdered. By that point, my client had the Punisher strap, and Mrs. Inmee had the Samurai watch. So, what the victim heard in his final moments... ...was none other than the sound of the watch Mrs. Inmee was wearing!
Tahrust:
Tahrust:
I wish to amend my testimony! What I thought were taiko drums was something else! My wife never had such a watch! It's the truth, I tell you! You must believe me, Your Magistry!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Be not deceived by the defense's lawyerly chicanery.
Phoenix:
(Now what?! He's been pretty quiet up to this point. What does he have up his sleeve?)
Nahyuta:
There is a big, gaping hole in his flimsy claim.
Phoenix:
A big, gaping hole? I don't think so!
Nahyuta:
Oh, no, I'm afraid it is there, all right. ...Just like the big, gaping holes in your putrid brain.
Phoenix:
My brain is neither putrid nor full of holes. I'm not a zombie, after all.
Nahyuta:
Heh, says the dead lawyer walking... He who is narrow of vision focuses on what is before him, never seeing the big picture. Or as they say in your country, you cannot see the forest for the trees! For if it is as you said... ...and Lady Inmee, the rebel, slew Acolyte Zeh'lot, the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra... ...then the rebel hunter would have been dead before the high priest was slain.
Judge:
That means...! The high priest could not have been slain by the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra!
Phoenix:
(Ack! How could I have missed that?!)
Nahyuta:
Who are you going to say killed the high priest now?!
Phoenix: 
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Nahyuta:
Do you finally understand? The sheer size of the holes that riddle your putrid brain?
Phoenix:
Ack! (I'm in hot water now. I don't have any other suspects in the high priest's murder!)
Nahyuta:
You mindless zombie. You should have begun your journey into the Twilight Realm long ago.
Phoenix:
(No. I will never give up! I just need to think things through and figure out... ...who really killed the high priest!)
Phoenix:
If Acolyte Zeh'lot had been Lady Kee'ra, he couldn't have killed the high priest! So, the question is, who did? Maybe I can get to the bottom of this by reviewing the events of this case in order! What evidence could tell me something about the crime scene before the murder? 
The Warbaa'd Dagger
Phoenix:
The Warbaa'd Dagger! ...No, that was found later, impaled in Zeh'lot's body. It doesn't tell me anything about the crime scene before the murder. I better think of something else.
Leads back to:
"What evidence could tell me something about the crime scene before the murder?"
Maya's testimony
Leads to:
The spring was stained red before the rite
The spring was stained red before the rite
Phoenix:
Oh, right... Maya said that the spring had been stained red before the rite even began. The spring was already red before the high priest's murder because of...
Zeh'lot's blood
Leads to:
The spring was stained red by Zeh'lot's blood
Tahrust's blood
Phoenix:
The high priest's blood? ...No, that doesn't make any sense. The high priest's murder happened during the rite, not before. So, that means... 
Leads back to:
"The spring was already red before the high priest's murder because of..."
The spring was stained red by Zeh'lot's blood
Phoenix:
That's right... Zeh'lot had been killed in the rebel hideout the day before the rite. ...And his blood had flowed into the spring. Wait a second. The high priest knew that Zeh'lot had been killed in the hideout. So why didn't he report it to the authorities? If Maya had been the killer, he could have easily had her arrested on the spot. Why didn't the high priest inform the authorities right then?
To threaten Maya
Phoenix:
He wanted to threaten Maya. ...Wait, why would he do that? I better think of another reason why he didn't inform the authorities.
Leads back to:
"Why didn't the high priest inform the authorities right then?"
To keep the hideout hidden
Leads to:
He wanted to keep the hideout secret
He wanted to keep the hideout secret
Phoenix:
If he reported Zeh'lot's murder...  ...the authorities would find out about the hideout. That's what he was worried about! But by going through with the rite... ...the high priest risked having Maya see the spring running red with blood. Why did he have to go through with the rite? Did he want to...?
Kill Maya
Phoenix:
Did he want to kill Maya? But he had any number of other chances to do that. The fact that she's still alive must mean he wasn't out to kill her.
Leads back to:
"Why did he have to go through with the rite? Did he want to...?"
Set up the scene during it
Leads to:
Use the rite to cover things up
Use the rite to cover things up
Phoenix:
He wanted to set up the crime scene to conceal the hideout! But how was he planning on concealing the source of the blood in the spring?
He emptied the spring
Phoenix:
Maybe he tried to empty the spring. Wait a second. It was still full of bloody water. Which means it hadn't been emptied. There must've been some other way he tried to conceal the source of the blood.
Leads back to:
"But how was he planning on concealing the source of the blood in the spring?"
He used Maya's blood
Phoenix:
Maybe he tried covering it up with Maya's blood. No, that can't be right. Maya didn't have a scratch on her. Time for another idea...
Leads back to:
"But how was he planning on concealing the source of the blood in the spring?"
He used his own blood
Leads to:
Stain the spring with his own blood
Stain the spring with his own blood
Phoenix:
He concealed the source of the blood with his own. That was how he kept the rebel hideout a secret! ...It's all starting to fall into place. I know who killed the high priest! It was...!
Maya
Phoenix:
Maya! ...Wait a second, that can't be right. She had no reason to conceal the source of the blood in the spring. The answer lies in who DID want to hide it!
Leads back to:
"I know who killed the high priest! It was...!"
Tahrust himself
Leads to:
TAHRUST'S DEATH WAS A SUICIDE
A third party
Phoenix:
Was there a third party at the scene of the crime? Hmm, I don't know why anyone else would want to conceal the blood's source, though. I better think of something else. The answer lies in who wanted to conceal the source of the blood in the spring!
Leads back to:
"I know who killed the high priest! It was...!"
TAHRUST'S DEATH WAS A SUICIDE
Phoenix:
I can't believe it! The high priest took his own life to keep the rebel hideout a secret!
Phoenix:
The high priest wasn't murdered by anyone. He took his own life to keep the rebel hideout a secret!
Tahrust:
WH--!
Nahyuta:
WHA--?!
Judge:
WH-WHAT'S THIIIIIIIIIIIIS?!
Tahrust:
...........................
Judge:
...Th-The high priest... committed suicide? I have never heard anything more absurd!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
The lawyer has placed a stain on the good priest's death with his putrid brain. Its putrid, gaping holes are as large as the hole in his logic.
Phoenix:
What hole?
Nahyuta:
You still fail to understand. You truly cannot see the forest for the trees! You claim the high priest took his own life. But have you considered who brought the dagger to the Plaza of Devotion?
Phoenix:
Ah...
Nahyuta:
After the high priest was killed, the dagger was thrust into Acolyte Zeh'lot's dead body. Only the accused, Maya Fey, could have done that!
Judge:
It is as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi says. Your claim is rather porous in its logic. And your evidence is too weak. You cannot prove that the high priest took his own life to conceal the rebel hideout.
Phoenix:
Urk! (They're right -- the dagger was impaled in Zeh'lot's body... ...but his body had been placed at the plaza the previous day.)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Would you care to respond?
Phoenix:
(Zeh'lot's body was already in the plaza the day before the rite. But what if the dagger was also already in him at that time?) The dagger was never at the Inner Sanctum.
It was moved by Maya
(Maya moved the dagger? No, that's not it. She had no reason to do that. If the dagger was already in Zeh'lot's body on the day before the rite, that means...)
Leads back to:
"The dagger was never at the Inner Sanctum."
It was moved by Tahrust's soul
(The high priest's spirit moved it? No, that's a stretch, even for a country where séances and channeling are used in court. If the dagger was already in Zeh'lot's body on the day before the rite, that means...)
Leads back to:
"The dagger was never at the Inner Sanctum."
Tahrust died by a different weapon
Leads to:
"Of course!"
Phoenix:
Of course! That's it! 
Nahyuta:
What is "it"?
Phoenix:
There was no need to move the dagger. It had already been stabbed into Acolyte Zeh'lot's body the day before the rite.
Judge:
What?! So that means... What does that mean?
Phoenix:
It means the dagger wasn't the weapon that took the high priest's life!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
But no weapon was ever found at the Inner Sanctum. If you will not listen to reason, then I insist you prove your assertion. Show us what you believe the real murder weapon to be!
Phoenix:
Th-The real weapon?! (I've got nothing, but I know there had to have been a weapon there! Maybe if I think back on the trial thus far, I'll spot the clue I need.)
Judge:
Well? Would the defense care to tell us what the real murder weapon is?
Phoenix:
This is what really killed the high priest!
Present Warbaa'd Statue
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"What really killed him has been at the Inner Sanctum all this time."
Present Warbaa'd Dagger
Phoenix:
Judge:
Well, that's odd... Did I not hear you say the dagger was NOT the murder weapon?
Phoenix:
That's right! I was just testing you to make sure you were listening!
Judge:
Yet again, all you have tested is my patience, defense.
Phoenix:
(Why did I even do that? We thought the high priest had been killed by the Warbaa'd Dagger, but... ...if it was something else that had killed him... ...it would have to be dagger-like in shape.)
Judge:
Are you prepared to show us what you believe really took his life?
Leads back to:
"This is what really killed the high priest!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Nahyuta:
.................. You believe that to be what took his life? Do you truly believe the high priest could have been killed by such an item?
Tahrust:
.........I do not recall ever seeing that.
Judge:
You just heard it from the horse's mouth. And now, you'll hear this from mine: penalty!
Phoenix:
(I have to present some conclusive evidence, or it's all over! We thought the high priest had been killed by the Warbaa'd Dagger, but... ...if it was something else that had killed him... ...it would have to be dagger-like in shape.)
Judge:
Are you prepared to show us what you believe really took his life?
Leads back to:
"This is what really killed the high priest!"
Phoenix:
What really killed him has been at the Inner Sanctum all this time. And its lethality has already been demonstrated by the late Acolyte Zeh'lot. That's right! It was the warbaa'd statue!
Nahyuta:
Poh-Poh-Poh-Poh-Poh... POHLKUNKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Judge:
...You believe that that statue claimed both victims' lives?!
Phoenix:
Would you care to chime in, Abbot Inmee?!
Tahrust:
Hrrm! Ngah-ah-ah... No...! He lies! Pay him no heed!
Beh'leeb:
Judge:
Why, it's...!
Nahyuta:
Lady Inmee!
Beh'leeb:
...Darling, don't you think this has gone on long enough?
Tahrust:
Tahrust:
Beh'leeb! ...No! Your Magistry, my wife knows nothing!
Judge:
...Please, Abbot Inmee, let your wife speak.
Tahrust:
Hrrrm... Hrrrrrrrngh...!
Judge:
Now, Lady Inmee, please continue if you would.
Beh'leeb:
..................... It's that time again.
Phoenix:
And what time would that be?
Beh'leeb:
Two thirty in the afternoon... The time my husband conducts his daily prayers. And... the time Puhray was slain.
Judge:
Th-That sound! It's...!
Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai alarm!
Beh'leeb:
.........I, too, like to pray at the same time as my dear husband. So, I set an alarm to remind me each day. But I had no idea it would come to this.
Judge:
........................
Tahrust:
No, stop! She knows not what she speaks!
Beh'leeb:
Your Magistry... I am the one who slew Acolyte Zeh'lot.
Tahrust:
HRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Judge:
A-Abbot Inmee! Bailiff, summon a physician at once!
Judge:
The physician is now attending the high priest, so there is no need to fear. Now, let us continue.
Phoenix:
(Um... And what about the half of him called "Maya" that's still among the living?) Mrs. Inmee, will you tell us everything you know?
Beh'leeb:
The truth is... I am a rebel, just like my husband. This tragedy unfolded before the rite, during the Feast of Blessings. I had gone to the rebel hideout to prepare it for Datz's escape.
Phoenix:
And that's when Acolyte Zeh'lot suddenly appeared?
Beh'leeb:
...Yes. Puhray was shocked when he saw me there.
Judge:
Acolyte Zeh'lot did not know you were a rebel?
Beh'leeb:
...I do not believe he did. I believe he was there simply to investigate the hideout.
Phoenix:
(And then he suddenly came face-to-face with Mrs. Inmee...) So, the true identity of the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra was Puhray Zeh'lot?
Beh'leeb:
Yes... He was a member of the secret police, serving directly under the minister of justice.
Phoenix:
(The secret police?!)
Beh'leeb:
And this is what he said to me... "I can kill rebels with impunity. The justice minister has my back!" He was using his position within the secret police to deal us rebels a heavy blow. But murder sanctioned by the crown is still murder.
Inga:
Heh, even without the DC Act, Dhurke and his insurgent scum buddies' days are numbered.
Phoenix:
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?!
Inga:
Let's just say... I got a little trick up my sleeve. So I'd watch it if I were you. 'Cause you got a defiant attitude -- like one o' them dragon dupes.
Phoenix:
(The trick up Minister Inga's sleeve was Lady Kee'ra...)
Rayfa:
N-No... This can't be! My father would never...!
Phoenix:
(This must be a bolt out of the blue for Rayfa.) This explains why Acolyte Zeh'lot abandoned his real name.
Beh'leeb:
Yes... He even went as far as covering up the tattoo that all Khura'inist clergy members receive.
Nahyuta:
Lady Kee'ra was a member of the secret police? That explains why no order was given to investigate her attacks.
Phoenix:
(I guess I'm not alone in hearing this for the first time.)
Rayfa:
But... But... This cannot be...
Gallery:
...Is this true? The justice minister is sanctioning state-sponsored murder?
Judge:
Peace! ...Now, Lady Inmee, please continue.
Beh'leeb:
Puhray suddenly lunged at me. That's when I pushed the stone slab toward him with all my might. But I never meant for what happened next to occur...
Tahrust:
Tahrust:
Allow me to take it from here.
Judge:
Abbot Inmee! Are you sure you're all right now?
Tahrust:
I am sorry you had to see that. But you need not worry about me. I am already dead.
Phoenix:
...Please. We need to know what was so important that you would take your own life.
Tahrust:
After I learned that my wife had accidentally slain Zeh'lot... ...I chilled his body with snow to make it seem as if he died more recently than he did. Then, I later moved it to the Plaza of Devotion and inserted the dagger into his wound. The plaza was empty at that time, for it was before prayer time had started. Finally, I placed his body in the prayer pose... ...knowing that no one would notice anything was wrong until the rite had concluded.
Judge:
Hmm... It is perfectly plausible that no one would disturb him if he seemed to be praying. We do treasure our prayer time, after all.
Phoenix:
So, you admit you tried to pin this crime on Maya Fey?
Tahrust:
...Yes, this was all my doing. I never told my wife of my plan. For surely she would have tried to stop me.
Beh'leeb:
.................................
Phoenix:
How did you get Ms. Fey's fingerprints on the dagger?
Tahrust:
I had her hold it while we were rehearsing the rite the day before. And right before the rite, I drugged her with a sleeping agent. Then, I put Lady Kee'ra's robes over the warbaa'd statue.
Phoenix:
(That means... ...Maya was probably already groggy by the time the rite started.)
Tahrust:
Finally, I ended my own life... ...to ensure that the crime would appear to have been by Acolyte Fey's own hand.
Judge:
Hmm... But when your body was discovered... ...Lady Kee'ra's robes were on the ground. How did they end up there if they were on the statue?
Tahrust:
After I impaled myself on one of the statue's dagger-like feathers... ...I used the last ounce of my strength to hurl my body backwards. As I did, I grabbed onto the robes, taking them with me, as I fell back onto the ground.
Judge:
How terrible! What possessed you to do such a thing?
Nahyuta:
You needn't have committed suicide simply to frame the accused.
Tahrust:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... As one well-versed in our kingdom's legal system... ...I would expect you of all people to understand.
Nahyuta:
...Understand what?
Phoenix:
This kingdom's legal system... Mrs. Inmee's crime... Your suicide... It can't be... That would be sadder than sad.
Judge:
Why, I believe the defense knows of what the high priest speaks.
Phoenix:
Yes, I finally understand. This explains why the high priest took his own life!
Present Dhurke's Law Book
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"...The Defense Culpability Act."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
And how, pray tell, does that explain why he took his own life?
Phoenix:
Don't you see? The reason is right here!
Tahrust:
There is nothing to see, for that bears no relation to the question at hand.
Phoenix:
Oh, umm... Did I get it wrong? (Why would the high priest commit suicide? If it was for his wife's sake... then maybe...!) Now I finally understand why the high priest took his own life!
Leads back to:
"This explains why the high priest took his own life!"
Phoenix:
...The Defense Culpability Act. Circumstantial evidence supports Mrs. Inmee's killing of Acolyte Zeh'lot in self-defense. However, it would be next to impossible to prove it without a lawyer. That's why the high priest wanted to pin the crime on Maya Fey.
Nahyuta:
...I fail to see what that has to do with his suicide.
Phoenix:
In Khura'in, the Divination Séance is the most important piece of trial evidence. The high priest wanted to frame Ms. Fey as a serial killer. It was a clever plan in which he made sure he'd see Lady Kee'ra in his final moments.
Tahrust:
...The lawyer speaks true. That is why I placed Lady Kee'ra's robes upon the warbaa'd statue. I made it seem that Acolyte Fey was the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra.
Rayfa:
Rayfa:
B-But...! Are you saying you used my Divination Séance to produce false evidence?
Tahrust:
Forgive me, Your Benevolence. ...But it was the only way to help my lovely wife.
Phoenix:
If you had approached me first, I could have proved that the murder was in self-defense.
Tahrust:
Perhaps... But I had little faith in lawyers, despite being a rebel.
Nahyuta:
How utterly foolish to cast away one's life for such a reason! There must have been other ways to cover up the crime!
Tahrust:
Yet, had I done so, my wife would rush to my defense. And when the case went to trial... ...she would suffer the same fate as I under the Defense Culpability Act. I could not have lived with myself had she been convicted because of that fiendish man!
Rayfa:
Th-This... This cannot be... All I have done under the laws of our kingdom... It has all been...
Phoenix:
(Poor Rayfa... She's really taking this hard. But I can't say I'm surprised.)
Tahrust:
Mr. Phoenix Wright. It is time to show the might of your legal prowess! You mustn't allow another innocent soul to be charged under that despicable law.
Phoenix:
...Of course. I'll do whatever I can.
Tahrust:
What I have done to you and Acolyte Fey is unforgivable. I can only offer my most humble of apologies. Your Magistry...
Judge:
Yes?
Tahrust:
I ask that you please look after my wife.
Judge:
You have my word.
Tahrust:
Your Benevolence, it is time that I return to the Twilight Realm. The Magatama of Parting, if you please...
Rayfa:
...............Very well.
Beh'leeb:
Beh'leeb:
Your Benevolence. Please, allow me the honor.
Rayfa:
...Y-Yes, it would be more fitting for you to send him on his way.
Phoenix:
(Mrs. Inmee...)
Beh'leeb:
Darling... I'm so glad I was able to see you one last time. Thank you... for everything.
Tahrust:
I'm sorry to leave you like this, my love...
Beh'leeb:
But now you can watch over me from the world beyond.
Tahrust:
Yes, always and forever...
Beh'leeb:
And with every breath I take, my darling, I'll be thinking of you.
Beh'leeb:
Farewell, my darling Tahrust.
Maya:
...The high priest has returned to the Twilight Realm.
Phoenix:
Maya!
Maya:
I feel great! I guess that means he didn't leave any regrets behind. Oh...! But what about the trial, Nick?
Phoenix:
...It's over. It was a sad reality born of love, and a great tragedy born of the Defense Culpability Act.
Judge:
Well, I see no need to continue this trial. Does the prosecution have anything to say?
Nahyuta:
Mr. Phoenix Wright... I owe a debt to you -- one that I will pay back in court someday.
Judge:
Now, to deliver today's verdict, and overturn that of yesterday's trial. With respect to all current and previous charges against them... ..I hereby declare the accused, Maya Fey, and her defense, Phoenix Wright...
Not Guilty
May 12, 4:20 PMHigh Court of Khura'in - Accused Lobby
Maya:
So, I was thinking, Nick... The legal system here is really stacked against the defense. It's totally unfair!
Phoenix:
...Yeah, it even forced the high priest to make the ultimate sacrifice just to protect his wife.
Maya:
It's just so sad...
Phoenix:
Protect the status quo, or join the revolution... If the real Lady Kee'ra were here, I wonder which side she would take.
Rayfa:
........................
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence...
Rayfa:
Huh?! What?!
Phoenix:
I was, uhh... just wondering. Are you all right?
Rayfa:
Quiet, you! How could I possibly be all right?! ........................
Phoenix:
(Yeah, she's not doing well at all...)
Rayfa:
......Who do you think you are -- suddenly appearing before me... ...trampling my Insights underfoot, and plunging the Hall of Justice into utter chaos! You even desecrated my mother and father's teachings, you... soulless infidel!
Phoenix:
(Oof, that was a bit more extreme than usual.)
Rayfa:
........................... What am I to do...? I had always believed that communing with a victim's mitamah... ...would lead me to the absolute truth. But each time you overturned my Insights... ...it was revealed that they served to support false charges, rather than the truth. I am left now with that heavy truth in my heart.
Phoenix:
(I'm sorry, Rayfa...)
Rayfa:
Perhaps I am not worthy of hearing the voices of the mitamah.
???:
That's where you're wrong, Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
What?
Phoenix:
(Maya?)
Rayfa:
How dare you--?!
Maya:
Your role is to bring forth the voices of the mitamah into our world. If you don't do it, who will?
Rayfa:
You know nothing, Maya Fey! It was spirit channeling, not a Divination Séance that brought the truth to light. How... How DARE an outsider like you employ the queen's secret art! But what can I do?! My spiritual power does not even approach yours! Ha ha ha ha! Is it not a cruel joke?! The royal priestess, bested by a lowly outsider?!
Phoenix:
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Rayfa:
Why not?! It is worth at least a laugh or two!
Maya:
...You shouldn't talk like that!
Rayfa:
Huh?!
Maya:
Listen, Your Benevolence... You were just fulfilling your duty, weren't you? And you're the only one capable of performing the Divination Séance, right? The station of royal priestess is not something to abandon lightly!
Rayfa:
...The station of royal priestess?
Maya:
The people of your kingdom believe in you. But if you really mean all that you just said... ...then what are they supposed to believe in?
Rayfa:
! Y-You know naught of what you speak!
Maya:
...Actually, I kinda do. After all, I'm only here training so I can become the master of my village back home.
Rayfa:
A village master, you say? ...I did not know. It seems I owe you an apology. For even today, I called you a neophyte practitioner.
Maya:
It's all right, Your Benevolence. Thank you for finally acknowledging me.
Phoenix:
(A future queen and a future village master? I guess it shouldn't be a surprise... ...considering they may have had a common ancestor.) Maya's right, Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
B-Barbed Head?
Phoenix:
Your Insights were a crucial piece of evidence in this last trial. It doesn't matter if they weren't always one hundred percent accurate. You should be proud of what you did. You've played an important role in assuring that justice was served.
Rayfa:
..................... Hmm...
Phoenix:
And besides, your Insights aren't the problem here. It's your kingdom's legal system. Without lawyers, your Insights have come to be accepted as the sole truth. And the Defense Culpability Act, which gave rise to that, is the root of it all.
Rayfa:
B-But that is the dangerous thinking of a rebel!
Maya:
...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein.
Rayfa:
.................. I wonder if I am even up to the task.
Maya:
Knowing you, Your Benevolence, you're more than capable.
Phoenix:
(...I've never heard Maya talk like this before. She's really come a long way.) 
*BOOOOM*
Phoenix:
Wh-What was that?
Bailiff:
It came from the hallway! Smoke! We'd better go check it out! Hurry!
Phoenix:
Mrs. Inmee!
Beh'leeb:
Mr. Wright, Acolyte Fey... I'm so sorry for what transpired. You were almost sentenced to death because of me. I will make amends by picking up where my husband left off. I will see the revolution through, so nothing like this can ever happen again! For that is the depth of my love for my dearly departed husband!
Datz:
Lady Inmee, we gotta hurry!
Phoenix:
That voice... Is that Mr. Are'bal?
Beh'leeb:
I must tell the people! They must learn that the peace we enjoy is a false one! One built on the backs of innocents charged with false crimes under that odious DC Act! We have it in our power to forge a society in which the law judges all of us fairly!
Datz:
Hey there, PW! I wish we had more time to talk, but...! Dhurke! Everything's ready! It's go time!
Phoenix:
Dhurke?
Dhurke:
.....................
Phoenix:
Wait, was that the rebel leader Dhurke?!
Bailiff:
After 'em! Don't let them get away!
Phoenix:
(The power to forge a society in which the law judges all of us fairly... It's the start of a legal revolution...)
Maya:
..................... Hey, Nick! Hate to bother you while you're lost in thought... ...but I just got this great idea!
Phoenix:
Wh-What is it?
Maya:
"The Steel Samurai vs. The Rebel Dhurke"! I bet it'd make for another awesome TV show! And if we threw the Plumed Punisher in there...! Everyone would go nuts over it!
Phoenix:
(............I'll never get what she sees in those shows. But it's good to know that no matter what happens, Maya will always be Maya.)
End
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That statement is inconsistent with this piece of evidence.
Nahyuta:
Let it go, and move on. Abandon this folly. You know very well your evidence proves nothing.
Phoenix:
Nice try, but you can't make me give up. I'm going to prove I'm right!
Judge:
You can point your finger as much as you want, but you're simply wasting your time. It is a pitiful sight to see a lawyer who doesn't know when he is beat.
Phoenix: 
(Argh... I just need to hang in there a little longer.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Please take a look at this piece of evidence. Anything come to mind?
Nahyuta:
............
Judge:
............
Phoenix:
W-Well...?
Judge:
Hm? Did the defense have something he would like to say?
Phoenix:
(That fell on deaf ears.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Judge:
Is something the matter?
Phoenix:
Sorry. That scream just sort of slipped out.
Judge:
I don't know about trials in your country, but we refrain from such rash outbursts here. Perhaps this will deter any future urges you might have.
Phoenix:
(I'm not helping my case in the judge's eyes, both literally and figuratively.)
Presenting incorrect sensation or Insight during Divination Séance
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence! isn't this statement inconsistent with the vision?
Rayfa:
Inconsistent...?
Phoenix:
Exactly! That's where the inconsistency lies!
Judge:
No, I believe it is in the defense's thought process that the inconsistency lies.
Phoenix:
(Argh. Guess there wasn't an inconsistency there after all...)
Consult (during cross-examination segment "Overview of the Second Murder", when evidence must be presented)
Maya:
Looks like you can't count on your bluffing skills to save your butt this time.
Phoenix:
Yeah... This is a tough one.
Maya:
Well, to me, there's something about this one statement that seems off.
Phoenix:
Yeah, it does sound a little strange, doesn't it? Thanks, Maya. I'll take another look at the evidence.
Maya:
You can always count on me!
Consult (during cross-examination segment "Overview of the Second Murder", when statements must be pressed)
Maya:
You're looking a little pale there, Nick. Are you all right?
Phoenix:
This trial is really putting me through the wringer.
Maya:
Maybe it's just a matter of getting the information you need.
Phoenix:
Right... Thanks, Maya. (Guess I'd better keep pressing, then!)
Maya:
Once you get more info, you can use it to make one of your famous bluffs!
Phoenix:
(She makes it sound like bluffing is my default move.)
Consult (during a Divination Séance, on initial Insight)
Maya:
It sure looks like you could use my help, Nick!
Phoenix:
Yes, please...
Maya:
Well, you know how the victim smelled gingihl? That sensation just seemed out of place.
Phoenix:
The smell of gingihl, huh? Thanks, Maya! (Okay, time to check the Séance vision again.)
Consult (during a Divination Séance, on first revised Insight)
Maya:
Nick, have you found any inconsistencies yet?
Phoenix:
Umm... I've been trying my best, but...
Maya:
I didn't notice any problems with the sensations that appeared.
Phoenix:
Then I guess we better focus on what the victim saw in his final moments.
Maya:
Another look at the updated Insights might help, too. A change in the day and time of the murder could result in an inconsistency.
Phoenix:
Right. Let's review the Séance vision while comparing it to the Insights.
Consult (during a Divination Séance, on second revised Insight)
Phoenix:
I can't find any inconsistencies, Maya.
Maya:
Don't give up yet, Nick. I mean, what about that Insight? You know, the one that said: "The victim stood with his hands on the stone slab in the hideout." Something about that doesn't seem to match up with the deceased's sensations.
Phoenix:
I see what you mean... Let's compare the victim's sensations to that particular Insight.
Consult (during all subsequent cross-examination segments, when evidence must be presented)
Phoenix:
(Argh, I can't find any inconsistencies in there. Maybe I overlooked something important. That one statement doesn't seem right, but I can't put my finger on it. I'd better look at the evidence again, too.)
Consult (during all subsequent cross-examination segments, when statements must be pressed)
Phoenix:
(Argh, I can't find any inconsistencies in there. Maybe I just don't have enough information yet. I should try pressing the witness some more.)
Too many penalties
Judge:
This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey... ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright... 
Guilty
