The Adventure of the Clouded Kokoro
Anime cutscene
'I begin to think, Wilson,' said Sholmes, turning his head languidly in my direction, 'that there is more to this case than that which we have observed. Indeed, that there may be another part to this story that we are yet to discover.' His eyes wandered, following the steam rising from his cup of herbal tea, leading him to the distant memory of that snowy evening - to the young lady, collapsed on the pavement along Briar Road, and to the knife in her back. Lit in the soft glow of gas lamps, a most extraordinary scene had been set, and under the cover of a light fog, the curtain had risen silently on the insoluble mystery of our invisible killer.
19th February, 9:47 a.m.
British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office
Examine evidence
Armband
Insignia on front
Ryunosuke:
These are the Scales of Justice. They're a symbol of the defence, aren't they?
Susato:
Yes, that's right. The scales are a symbol of fairness, to show that all are treated equally in the eyes of the law. And they're a warning to those who enter the courtroom without an impartial mind. 
Ryunosuke:
But if they're the mark of the defence... ...it would be more auspicious if they were weighing more heavily on the 'not guilty' side, I think. 
Susato:
......... Very impartial, I'm sure.
Inside of armband
Ryunosuke:
The lawyer's name is embroidered on the inside here, look. 'Kazuma Asogi'... This was his band, of course. 
Susato:
He had his heart set on this study tour in Great Britain. 
Ryunosuke:
I'm sure he would have found the truth he longed for here. (...But he lost his life before he even had the chance to see the place.)
Susato:
I have such a strong sense of his hopes and dreams when I look at this armband, though.
Susato:
Did you sleep last night, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
No...not at all.
Susato:
It was an enormous hotel, wasn't it? The rooms were so luxurious! I felt like we were staying in a palace! And with all the gas lights twinkling, it was brighter than day even in the middle of the night!
Ryunosuke:
What about the enormous beds? After my time on the SS Burya, I wasn't going to waste a single inch of that space. I spent the entire night rolling from one side of the mattress to the other.
Susato:
Oh yes, it really was the sort of night you can only dream of normally. Except... ...when I learnt that we owed three pounds for the rooms, that dream quickly turned into a nightmare.
Ryunosuke:
Oops! ...Sorry about that. The building was so impressive, and the entrance so inviting, I just...wandered in without thinking.
Susato:
In a lodging house in Japan, that sum of money would put a roof over your head for a whole year. I did try, but...I'm afraid I couldn't help my tears when we were presented with the bill.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... I really am sorry...
Susato:
Well, never mind. We must find some more affordable lodgings straight away, though. If we're not careful, our entire stipend will be used up in ten days or less.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... London is a scary place...
Ah, good morning to you at this early hour.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes! Um...we...erm... Well!
Susato:
...Good morning to you, Lord Chief Justice. We have come to report on the outcome of the trial at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san is amazing. She doesn't bat an eyelid, even in the presence of the imposing Lord Stronghart.)
Stronghart:
Yes, I believe you had a very comprehensive initiation into British courtroom practices.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes! It was very...eye-opening, thank you!
Susato:
And...in accordance with your instructions, Lord Stronghart... ...Mr Naruhodo performed his duty to the end.
Stronghart:
Yes...I've already been apprised of events. You conducted a remarkable defence. ...You may consider the test passed.
Ryunosuke:
Oh!
Stronghart:
No longer are you a student from the Empire of Japan... You may henceforth claim to be...a fully fledged lawyer! My country is delighted to welcome young talent from such a remote Eastern land.
Ryunosuke:
Um...thank you very much! (So...I'm a lawyer now...)
Stronghart:
Now, in view of your new appointment, I have a fresh case in mind for you. I'd like you to take it on at once. ...I trust that won't be a problem?
Ryunosuke:
Another case? Already?
Stronghart:
Nothing trains a lawyer better than practical experience. ...I'm sure I don't sense dissatisfaction, do I?
Ryunosuke:
......... It's just that yesterday's trial ended...unusually. I haven't quite come to terms with it.
Stronghart:
What's to come to terms with? The man was cleared. ...What more were you hoping for?
Ryunosuke:
.........
Judge:
The culpability of the defendant has not, at the present time, been established by this court. Consequently... ...the jury will not be required to proffer judgement.
McGilded:
Well, Lord van Zieks...it's been a pleasure, so it has. And as for you, my dear fella...I couldn't have asked for a better defence!
Wah hah hah hah hah!
Ryunosuke:
I just can't help wondering... if Mr McGilded really was innocent?
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
It's just that I never managed to ascertain the truth. And then the trial ended.
Stronghart:
......... Well, you needn't let it trouble you for a second longer.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
What do you mean, Lord Stronghart?
Stronghart:
Magnus McGilded passed away. Immediately following the trial.
Susato:
No!
Ryunosuke:
What?! Mr... Mr McGilded is... ...dead?!
Stronghart:
I have nineteen minutes and forty-one seconds until my next engagement. ...Time enough to talk.
Examine
Bookshelves
Ryunosuke:
Just look at all the knotty books packed together on these shelves! They go from floor to ceiling!
Susato:
And they're all books that you couldn't hope to come by in Japan. It's like a dream!
Ryunosuke:
Yes...a very bad dream.
Susato:
They're not all about British law, either. There are books about the judicial systems of other Western nations. France, Germany, Spain, Holland...
Ryunosuke:
What about Russia?
Susato:
Why do you ask?
Ryunosuke:
I was wondering about asking the Lord Chief Justice how you say 'wardrobe' in Russian. What do you think?
Susato:
...I think, perhaps, it's a thought best abandoned.
Armor
Ryunosuke:
Look at these menacing metal giants facing each other across the room!
Susato:
I believe they're... Yes, they're suits of armour.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, right... I thought maybe they were like the lion-dogs we have in Japan guarding shrine gates.
Susato:
No, not at all. In fact, in Europe, suits of armour like these are always possessed by evil spirits, you know. And they roam around in the middle of the night.
Ryunosuke:
Really? ...Is there nothing you don't know, Miss Susato?
Susato:
This book tells me everything I need to know about everything. If you're ever unsure, just ask!
Ryunosuke:
(Where did she get that incredible tome?!)
Gears
Ryunosuke:
Is this...some kind of clock?
Susato:
Actually, I, I think we might be INSIDE some sort of giant clock. But those gears are larger than anything you'd find on a steam locomotive, even!
Ryunosuke:
It's...eerie. Do you think clocks are some sort of hobby of his? The Lord Chief Justice, I mean.
Susato:
Well, boys do enjoy fiddling around with machines, don't they?
Ryunosuke:
I'm not sure you could 'fiddle' with cogs that size! And I'm certain you couldn't call him a 'boy'! (Still, it's amazing how little noise the cogs make, considering how large they are. There's actually something quite soothing about their precise rhythm...)
Chair or desk
Susato:
This must be the Lord Chief Justice's desk. I believe it's made of marble.
Ryunosuke:
It looks more like an over-the-top tombstone that's toppled over to me.
Susato:
I think that's your fanciful imagination at work again, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
It feels like everything that's normally made of wood and paper at home... ...is made of bricks and stone here.
Susato:
I know. That's why this place feels so overbearing, I'm sure.
Converse
McGilded's death
Ryunosuke:
I don't understand! What happened?! How can he be dead?
Stronghart:
After the trial concluded yesterday, there was a great commotion in the Old Bailey. As you'll presumably recall, an omnibus had been wheeled into the courtroom.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course. That was the scene of the crime which Mr McGilded had been accused of.
Stronghart:
Precisely. Well, while the bailiff's attention was diverted by some other matter, the omnibus went up in flames.
Ryunosuke:
No...
Susato:
How could such a thing have happened?
Stronghart:
That is being investigated as we speak. But already... ...the police have identified a corpse found inside the charred shell of the carriage as that of McGilded.
Ryunosuke:
That's awful!
Stronghart:
The man must have slipped inside whilst the bailiff's attention was elsewhere.
Ryunosuke:
(...That bailiff really needs to pay more attention.)
Susato:
And how could THAT have happened?
Stronghart:
That is also being investigated as we speak.
Susato:
......... Thinking back now... ...immediately after the trial, Mr McGilded did mention going back into the courtroom to look at the omnibus.
McGilded:
Well, I must be makin' tracks now. 'Tis time for the inspection.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? What inspection? 
McGilded:
They're goin' to examine the omnibus again, so I'm told. I asked if I could be present for it meself.
Stronghart:
An inspection of the omnibus? Not to my knowledge. I don't believe Scotland Yard had any intention of re-examining the carriage.
Ryunosuke:
But... Then who was Mr McGilded talking about?
Stronghart:
Never mind that now. The Yard is making a thorough investigation. This matter is no longer any concern of yours. Leave it to the police.
Susato:
Poor Mr McGilded...
British court
Stronghart:
So...how did you find your first taste of our country's supreme court?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Well, um...I don't know... I mean! It was...wow!
Susato:
...Mr Naruhodo means that the whole experience was steeped in the solemnity of Great Britain's long history. It's really a world apart from our own judicial system in Japan, which is only a few short decades old.
Ryunosuke:
(...Wow, Susato-san has such a way with words.)
Susato:
...And you seem to have a way of failing to find the right ones.
Stronghart:
The judicial system here is the most advanced in the world. ...Learn all you can.
Ryunosuke:
......... (The most advanced in the world, is it?)
Stronghart:
It was fortunate... ...that your very first trial was a simple affair.
Susato:
Simple? That was simple?!
Stronghart:
As I believe I mentioned yesterday morning...it was a trial you couldn't lose.
Susato:
I don't mean to be contrary, Lord Stronghart, but... the case was anything but simple!
Stronghart:
.........
Ryunosuke:
The circumstances of the case were so incriminating, I was stunned when I first heard them. In fact, I'm still finding it hard to believe that we managed to get a favourable verdict.
Stronghart:
......... Heh heh heh...
Ryunosuke:
Is, is something funny?
Stronghart:
No no, my apologies. However, the fact is that you did receive the not guilty verdict you set out to achieve.
Susato:
...!
Stronghart:
And that can only be attributed to exceptional talent... wouldn't you agree?
Ryunosuke:
Well, I, I don't know about that...
Stronghart:
......... Well, never mind. You exceeded my expectations, I freely admit. ...That much at least is an undeniable truth. Which is precisely why I have prepared the new case for you that I mentioned before.
Ryunosuke:
(What's going on? What was he going to say before?)
New case
Susato:
Could you perhaps give us some more details about the new case you mentioned?
Ryunosuke:
(Don't tell me, it's a murder and the trial starts in ten minutes...)
Stronghart:
Don't worry, it's nothing so alarming or quite so urgent as your last assignment. In fact, this case is completely different.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see. (Did, did he just read my mind?)
Stronghart:
That is to say, no one has died...as yet. And the trial will not be today. There is plenty of time to research the case thoroughly. ...Twenty-three hours, forty-three minutes and nineteen seconds to be precise.
Ryunosuke:
Haah... (So the trial's tomorrow then.) .........
Susato:
Is everything alright?
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes. I'm just a little confused, that's all. Yesterday's trial was... Well, it's left me wondering if I'm really cut out for being a lawyer.
Susato:
Oh, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
(I don't know if I could face standing in that courtroom again after Mr McGilded's trial.)
Stronghart:
Ah yes, I nearly forgot... There is one similarity with yesterday's case. Once again, there is currently no one to advocate for the defence.
Ryunosuke:
Oh!
Stronghart:
If the situation remains unchanged, the trial will start tomorrow with the defendant unrepresented. And if that happens, I need not remind you of the inevitable outcome.
Susato:
The most terrible end awaits the defendant...
Stronghart:
Yes...that's right.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (Here we go again...)
Present
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Lord Stronghart, may I show you this?
Stronghart:
To accept this item, issue a receipt, examine it thoroughly and make a formal statement of my findings... ...would require something in the region of twenty-four seconds of my time.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Stronghart:
Does the item warrant twenty-four seconds of my time, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
...Let's leave it for now.
After clearing all Converse options:
Stronghart:
...Your time is up. You will have to excuse me. I would advise you to begin making preparations for tomorrow's trial. After all, the clock is ever ticking. There is now but twenty-three hours, twenty-six minutes and thirty-nine seconds until the court sits.
Ryunosuke:
(Last time he mentioned the twenty-three hours, he said there was plenty of time...)
Stronghart:
And one more thing...Mr Naruhodo... There is something I should like to ask you.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um...what's that?
Stronghart:
Yesterday, you remarked upon something... That you intend to see through the will of your late compatriot, Mr Asogi.
Susato:
...!
Stronghart:
I would be interested to hear what exactly you mean by that... ...inside thirty-four seconds.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, well, erm... Kazuma always used to say, you see... ...that he wanted to learn how the greatest justice system in the world worked so he could change ours in Japan. Now that he's gone, I'd like to work towards that myself. ...And...there's another thing...
Susato:
Oh!
Stronghart:
'Another thing'? Continue...
Ryunosuke:
On the way here, on the steamship, he said something to me...
There's something very important that I have to do.
Stronghart:
'Something very important'? And what, exactly, would that be?
Ryunosuke:
He...never had a chance to tell me. I suppose he would have done...if he'd ever made it to Great Britain.
Stronghart:
...You're out of time. Well, thank you for an enlightening discussion.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! What's all this about?! Mr Asogi never once mentioned anything of the sort to me!
Stronghart:
I urge you both to focus your attentions on the matter at hand. I've taken the liberty of summoning the police inspector in charge of the case. He'll be able to apprise you of the details.
Ryunosuke:
(How long has he been there?)
Stronghart:
So...I wish you the best of luck...and bid you farewell.
Susato:
......... 'There's something very important that I have to do.' Kazuma-sama... What did you mean...?
Ryunosuke:
I wish I knew. But honestly, he never told me. ...Anyway, we had better talk to the detective, don't you think?
Susato:
Yes, you're right!
Ryunosuke:
(I hope I'm just imagining it, but I wouldn't say he looks pleased to see us at all.)
Examine
Inspector
Ryunosuke:
...Um, could we trouble you?
???:
What do you think?!
Ryunosuke:
Agh! Erm... Um... Lovely weather, isn't it?
???:
What's the weather got to do with anythin'?
Ryunosuke:
Agh!
???:
Listen to me, you young Japanese upstart! Some frippery about the weather doesn't get every English gent eatin' out of your hand, you know?
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... But Susato-san told me it was foolproof...)
???:
I'm a busy man. A very busy man! There's a crime scene to investigate, but I'm here havin' to give the likes of you a talkin' to!
Ryunosuke:
Oh... I'm ever so sorry...
???:
Can you imagine what the other officers there will be sayin'? Hm? 'Haven't seen Gregson anywhere, have you?' 'No, he's too busy with the bigwigs these days.' And all because of some bumpkin who's here on a jaunt from a country I've never even heard of! Hear that rippin' sound? That's my reputation at the Yard goin' to tatters!
Ryunosuke:
(There's no need to rip us apart as well...)
Susato:
...I don't believe we've been introduced. This is Mr Ryunosuke Naruhodo, a defence lawyer.
???:
...Eh?
Susato:
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I'm Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant, Su-
???:
...Eh?
Susato:
It's lovely weather we're having today, isn't it?
???:
......... It is unseasonably fine, I grant you. London winters don't see a lot of sunshine.
Ryunosuke:
(Unbelievable! How did she pull that off?)
???:
So... Ahem! Lord Stronghart has asked me to fill you in on the case.
Gregson:
The name's Tobias Gregson. Inspector Gregson to you. I'm from Scotland Yard.
Susato:
Gregson?! ...Um, Inspector...Gregson...?
Ryunosuke:
(What's the matter with Susato-san? Does this detective's name mean something to her?)
Inspector Gregson
Susato:
Inspector...are you perhaps... ...THE Inspector Gregson?
Gregson:
.........
Ryunosuke:
You're acting like you know this man, Miss Susato. But he's a London detective.
Susato:
Oh, I do know him! Very well, in fact!
Ryunosuke:
Very well?!
Susato:
Yes! He features prominently in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, in that publication. What's it called again? Randst Magazine?
Susato:
That's right. Inspector Gregson and Mr Sholmes enjoy a wonderful friendly rivalry!
Ryunosuke:
Really? YOU rival the great Mr Sholmes? That's incredible!
Gregson:
Oh, um...well, I don't know about that... Mr Sholmes isn't a professional like myself, of course. But he does come up with the goods from time to time.
Susato:
Mr Sholmes is equally complimentary about you, Inspector, isn't he? You've earnt his highest praise! 'Gregson is the pick of a bad lot of all the Scotland Yarders!' Those were his own words!
Ryunosuke:
...That's his highest praise?
Susato:
Well, Mr Sholmes isn't particularly known for giving compliments, you see.
Gregson:
That he is not! And thanks to that magazine, my name's known all over London town now!
Ryunosuke:
That's great, isn't it?
Gregson:
Hmph. I have to admit that to start with I was a little... well, flattered by all the attention. Everyone wanted to shake my hand, and my reputation at the Yard went through the roof.
Ryunosuke:
Well that's wonderful!
Gregson:
No it is NOT! There's nothin' more sinister than the man on the street! People are always lookin' at me now. They're whisperin' rumours about me under their breath, I'm sure.
Ryunosuke:
Rumours?
Susato:
Are, are you quite sure?
Gregson:
'He's changed since he started appearin' in those stories... The fame's gone to his head.' Stuff like that.
Susato:
Gosh, do you really think people are saying such mean-spirited things about you?
Gregson:
...Like I said, they whisper! So I can't catch exactly what they're sayin'. But I know what folk are like. I'm sure that's what they're sayin'! As sure as eggs is eggs!
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
I get the feeling this detective could be very hard work...
Susato:
Oh dear... Perhaps a sudden rise to fame does change people...
The case
Ryunosuke:
So, um...about the case that the Lord Chief Justice mentioned before...
Gregson:
Nothin' to tell, really. As far as we're concerned at the Yard, it couldn't be simpler.
Susato:
Oh dear. That probably means... ...that as far as we're concerned as lawyers, it couldn't be more complicated.
Ryunosuke:
I wish you were wrong about that, but I have a nasty feeling you're right.
Gregson:
A young woman was walkin' along the pavement on Briar Road when she was stabbed from behind. Fortunately, it wasn't fatal, but she's still laid up in hospital, unconscious.
Susato:
That's despicable! What sort of coward would attack the poor woman from behind!
Ryunosuke:
I suppose you would have finished whoever it was off with a Susato Takedown, would you?
Susato:
That is neither here nor there, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
(Brace yourself, Ryunosuke! You've angered her now!)
Gregson:
Anyway, after somethin' of a whirlwind investigation, the criminal was arrested. He barely had time for a cup of tea after the incident took place, to be honest.
Ryunosuke:
So...there must have been something left at the scene that led you directly to the culprit?
Susato:
Or perhaps a reliable witness who recognised the person in question?
Gregson:
Let me stop you right there. ...You're wastin' your time on this one.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gregson:
There's nothin' you can do. There's no way to help the bloke now.
Ryunosuke:
Why ever not?
Gregson:
Simple... The prosecutor that's been assigned to the trial tomorrow...is Lord Barok van Zieks.
Ryunosuke:
No!
Gregson:
Sounds like you've heard of him then.
Susato:
Oh yes, we are very familiar with Lord van Zieks. Believed to be the harbinger of death itself...
Ryunosuke:
(The Reaper of the Bailey...)
Reaper of the Bailey (appears after "The case")
Ryunosuke:
Lord Barok van Zieks... (...who we faced in court only yesterday.)
Susato:
Mr McGilded told us about him before the trial, didn't he?
When van Zieks stands for the prosecution, they call the accused his 'sacrificial lambs'. And in every single trial in which he's been the prosecutor...the accused has been damned!
Ryunosuke:
This Reaper of the Bailey nickname... I suppose he's earnt that because every defendant he advocates against is found guilty, is that it?
Gregson:
.........
Susato:
Well, if that's the case, we should inform you, Inspector... ...that in yesterday's trial against Lord van Zieks... Mr Naruhodo secured a verdict of not guilty!
Gregson:
Haah... And what of it?
Susato:
Oh! Well, um, I think... ...that means that even against the Reaper of the Bailey, it's not impossible to save the defendant!
Gregson:
No, you really don't have a clue, do you?
Ryunosuke:
...What do you mean?
Gregson:
What happened to that bloke in the end, eh? He's dead.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Gregson:
Magnus McGilded came a cropper in that omnibus when it went up in flames. So you can't rightly say you saved the defendant, can you?
Ryunosuke:
What...what are you saying?!
Gregson:
Look, if van Zieks could get the dirt to stick on everyone, he'd be a miracle-worker. But that's not how it goes. He doesn't work miracles; he works magic...black magic. I'd have a good, long think about that, if I were you.
Ryunosuke:
(...Are we really supposed to believe that?) 
Gregson:
.........
After clearing all Converse options with Tobias Gregson:
Gregson:
...Right, well, I've filled you in as requested, and I'm very nearly out of chips... So I'll be headin' back to the crime scene now. We're still carryin' out a few investigations there.
Susato:
It was Briar Road, you said, didn't you? Where the incident took place.
Gregson:
That's correct, ma'am. And if you head over to the holding cells you can meet the criminal himself.
Ryunosuke:
You've branded him a criminal already?
Gregson:
He's as good as. Shakin' like a leaf in his cell, he is. ...It'll give you a chuckle if nothin' else. He's inmate fifty-three. Speak to the jailer and he'll show you the way.
Ryunosuke:
Inmate fifty-three... Thank you. ......... (...So there's no helping anyone against the Reaper of the Bailey, they say...)
Susato:
Is something troubling you, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
..........
Susato:
To tell the truth, when I recall the trial yesterday, I can't stop myself from shaking. The idea of facing the Reaper in court again is... Well, if you think it's too much for you, there's no shame in turning the case down. That takes courage, too.
Ryunosuke:
......... But if the man they've arrested is innocent...
Susato:
...!
Ryunosuke:
...You could well imagine he would be shaking like a leaf in his cell. And I for one wouldn't find the sight of that funny.
Susato:
So...
Ryunosuke:
If I'm honest, I'm still reeling from the shock of yesterday's events myself. And I'm really not sure if I'll be able to help this man, whoever he is. But I'd like to try. So I think I'm going to make some enquiries. ...Will you help?
Susato:
.........
Did you really think you had to ask? After all...I am your judicial assistant!
Ryunosuke:
Thank you... So then...shall we?
Susato:
Yes! Let's go!
19th February
Local Prison, Cell 9
Ryunosuke:
So these are British prison cells...
Susato:
Oh, they're ghastly. It feels just like a dungeon.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. And having experienced it in Japan myself... ...I can assure you that our wooden cells feel a lot cosier than these cold, stone walls.
Susato:
Oh, don't, Mr Naruhodo! You're making it seem worse!
Ryunosuke:
(Apparently, our client is in this cell here. But it's so dark at the back there, I can't make him out. I wonder what he's like...)
Bailiff:
Inmate fifty-three! Your legal representative is 'ere to see you! Stop 'iding at the back of the cell and show your face at once!
Am I...? Am I a cat, as yet with no name?! Calling me by a number! It's utterly, unbelievably, unjustly unreasonable! I refuse to answer!
Susato:
......... Mr Naruhodo, what...? What do you think is going on here?
Ryunosuke:
I have no idea. But I wasn't just hearing things, was I? That tirade of complaints was in Japanese!
???:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Erm, excuse me, but who-
???:
Shh! Quiet! ......... They're all around. Hiding. I know they are! They're watching...listening...even now... I... I can sense it! .........
Ryunosuke:
Um...right... So, could I ask you, who exactly-
???:
There you are! You've come to curse me, haven't you? Don't try to hide it! You're a ghost!
Ryunosuke:
A ghost?!
???:
.........
Susato:
......... We mean you no harm, prisoner-san. Are you... ...Japanese, by any chance?
???:
......... This is... This is... BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS!!! Forgive me for that outburst before. I'm so sorry.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, it's...fine. We were just a little surprised, that's all.
???:
Imagine it! It's been twelve long months since I left my hometown! And here I am, in a frightful fix in a foreign land! So hearing the sweet, sentimental tones of a compatriot's voice here in this damp, dark hellhole was a...a...
Most Monumentally Moving Moment!
Ryunosuke:
(Who could have guessed that this new client Lord Stronghart assigned to us... ...would turn out to be a fellow Japanese?!)
???:
Ah... ...what compassion my fellow countrymen show! To dispatch a first-class lawyer all the way from Japan to defend a mere foreign student!
Noble, Nurturing, Never-Failing Nippon!
Ryunosuke:
A, a first-class lawyer? (Oh dear, I think there's been something of a misunderstanding here...)
Susato:
I wonder... Would you be so kind as to tell us what's happened? Why you've been detained as a suspect, for example.
???:
Yes... Yes! I can! I will!
Shan't Stay Sullen and Silent!
Susato:
I'm not quite sure I understand what he means, but...he seems happy!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, he does... (I just hope he actually has a good reason to be...) Thank you for your cooperation. I am a lawyer, as you said. My name is Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
Susato:
And I am Naruhodo-san's judicial assistant, Susato Mikotoba.
???:
I am... ...a visiting student, sent here by our government.
Soseki:
Notably, Notoriously Named Natsume! ...Soseki Natsume.

Soseki Natsume
Ryunosuke:
Soseki Natsume...san? What an unusual name.
Soseki:
Call me Soseki, please. I'm a poet, you see. A writer of haiku. It's something of a nom de plume.
Ryunosuke:
A nom de plume? You mean, an alias?
Susato:
That's right, Naruhodo-san.
Soseki:
No no NO! Don't be so prosaic! It's MUCH MORE REFINED than that!
Ryunosuke:
...And haiku? That really reminds me of home.
Susato:
Did I hear you say that you were a visiting student, sent over here by the government?
Soseki:
Yes yes, that's right. A year ago, I was told to go and study English. First I had to suffer that misery, and now this! It's beyond the pale!
Ryunosuke:
'Suffer that misery'? Did you not want to study here?
Soseki:
No! I mean, I've had an interest in Great Britain for some years, of course.
Ryunosuke:
...Oh.
Soseki:
But! Just because the government tells you to do something, does it mean you CAN do it? No!
Susato:
What do you mean?
Soseki:
If they'd told me to study English literature, THAT I could have understood. That's my field. But no, they told me to study the English language!
Utterly, Unbelievably, Unjustly Unreasonable!
Ryunosuke:
I see...
Soseki:
Only the other day, I was told to send a report about my first year here. I tendered a blank piece of paper.
Wise Words on White Washi!
Susato:
...You must be a man of great standing.
Soseki:
Oh yes! ...So I'm often told.
Ryunosuke:
(And often like to be told, it seems...)
The accusation against you
Susato:
Could you perhaps tells us exactly why you've been arrested, Soseki-san?
Soseki:
I didn't do it! I didn't commit that atrocious murder!
Susato:
Murder?!
Soseki:
Oh! No... No no, it's all alright. The woman didn't actually die, did she? But she was stabbed! With a knife! Right before my eyes!
Ryunosuke:
'Before your eyes'? You mean, you saw the attacker?
Soseki:
......... I didn't see anyone.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Soseki:
If I'd seen the person who did it...do you think I'd be locked up in here?
Susato:
Oh dear, it seems this case is becoming rather complicated.
Soseki:
Why me? WHY ME?! ...Why did that silly woman have to be stabbed in front of ME?! It's the curse! The curse of London! It's...
Incredibly, Inexcusably, Irritatingly Inconvenient!
Ryunosuke:
(So Soseki-san was there at the scene, but he didn't see the attacker...)
Susato:
It's vital that we find out more about the case!
About the case (appears after "The accusation against you")
Soseki:
It was an accursed evening, just after the snow had started to clear and heavy with fog. I'd been to the bookshop to buy some books, and I was on my way back to my accursed lodgings.
Ryunosuke:
(...Sure the bookshop wasn't accursed, too?)
Soseki:
As I was walking along that accursed pavement, I could make out the sole silhouette of another ahead of me. A woman, wearing a green overcoat, she was. And just as I went to overtake her... ...she suddenly let out a little scream, and collapsed onto the cold, hard slabs of stone at my feet!
Susato:
How terrible!
Soseki:
I called out to the woman, but...she didn't move! It, it was like a...
Ghostly, Ghoulish, Grim Graveyard!
Ryunosuke:
(Slight exaggeration there, perhaps...?)
Soseki:
I was terrified! I had to get away from there! So I ran! As fast as my legs would carry me back to my accursed lodgings!
Ryunosuke:
That's...not good.
Soseki:
They'll, they'll say it was shameful, I know. To run away like that...
Susato:
Tell me, Soseki-san, was the victim an acquaintance of yours?
Soseki:
Don't be ridiculous! Do you think I know nay of these fair-haired English?! And a young woman at that! I'm diffident! Shy! Timid! Unsure! I can't TALK to people!
Ryunosuke:
I...I see... (A young woman, unknown to Soseki-san...) And at the time it happened... ...who else did you see nearby? Did anybody pass you?
Soseki:
......... Regrettably... ...apart from myself and the woman...I didn't see a soul.
Ryunosuke:
No one?! (Oh great...)
Susato:
So the victim was unknown to you, and there was nobody else on the street at the time... That creates something of a conundrum, doesn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Hm? (What conundrum?)
Conundrum (appears after "About the case")
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean, Susato-san? What's the conundrum?
Susato:
Well, if what Soseki-san has just told us is true, there's something I can't explain. He says that he didn't know the victim, and that there was no one else at the scene. Then he apparently fled without having been seen.
Soseki:
I did, I did!
Ryunosuke:
(...But if that's the case... ...surely this man has to be the culprit?)
Soseki:
AAAAAARGH! You... What did you just say?!
Ryunosuke:
Nothing! I, I didn't say anything! (Oops. Perhaps I thought that a little 'loudly'...)
Susato:
Actually, that's not what was troubling me. What I was thinking was, how did Soseki-san actually come to be arrested?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
He didn't touch the victim, and there was nobody at the scene to see him. So how did the police ever discover that he was there in the first place?
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes! (She's right!)
Soseki:
......... It......... It was him... That accursed 'great detective'... He led the police to me! Of all the bad luck!
Ryunosuke:
Accursed...'great detective'...? (Could it be...?)
Soseki:
I shall never forget that man's name as long as I live! With his haughty laugh and his self-proclaimed greatness!
Brash, Big-Headed Busybody Begone! May you be cursed until the end of your days... Herr Lock Sholmes!
Ryunosuke:
I... I knew it!
Susato:
Mr... Mr Sholmes?!
Changes "About the case" Converse option to "Herr Lock Sholmes"
Herr Lock Sholmes (appears after "Conundrum")
Ryunosuke:
(Well, I didn't expect to hear that name from this man's lips, that's for sure.)
Soseki:
It was the morning after that nightmare had unfolded on the pavement before me. I was gnawing on a sliver of hard cheese when some men suddenly burst in through the door. They started shouting at me! 'This is the police! Put the weapon down!' Yes, it was a thin sliver, and yes it was hard... But I wasn't eating a weapon!
Disgusting Dietary Discrimination Devils!
Ryunosuke:
You...clearly had a trying morning yesterday.
Soseki:
And there he was, in the middle of all the policemen, grinning like a Cheshire cat! That...Herr Lock Sholmes!
Ryunosuke:
It's, it's actually just 'Herlock Sholmes'. He's English.
Soseki:
I've since found out that he's a famous name in detection here in London.
Susato:
Yes, the great detective is really very well known.
Soseki:
And his overly sharp mind managed to deduce my whereabouts apparently. He thinks I'm the knife-wielding madman! Me?! This weak, stooped kitten of a man!
Ryunosuke:
(I wonder what great deduction process led him to his conclusion this time...)
Susato:
Do you mean to say... ...that Mr Sholmes's deduction was the only reason the police arrested you? That would be really most unreasonable!
Soseki:
......... Well, um...the thing is... I was...I was thrown into a panic when they barged their way in.
Susato:
Of course you were! That's only natural.
Soseki:
I was terrified and trembling. And they kept throwing question after question at me. In impossible English!
Fiendish Foreign Flim-Flammery!
Ryunosuke:
Well...we are in England. You can't really blame them for questioning you in English.
Soseki:
Good point, good point. But my mind went blank. I, I knew I had to answer, but I didn't know what to say. So I just kept repeating things like, 'Yes, I do!' and 'I'm fine!' The next thing I knew, I was in manacles. And before I knew it, I was thrown in here.
Susato:
Oh dear. I'm afraid...that's hardly surprising.
Ryunosuke:
('I'm fine'? He's not fine now...)
Present
Armband
Soseki:
Yes! YES! The symbol of one of our great empire's first-rate lawyers! Which means! Of course! You'll stand by my side! You'll defend me!
Ryunosuke:
Oh... No, sorry, that wasn't why I was showing it to you.
Soseki:
......... THEN WHY ELSE WOULD YOU SHOW ME THAT?!
Ryunosuke:
(...Oops. In hindsight, that probably wasn't the best idea.)
After clearing all Converse options:
Soseki:
Mr Naruhodo Esquire!
Ryunosuke:
...Oh, you can just call me Naruhodo. And when we're speaking English, a simple 'Mister' is more than enough.
Soseki:
Oh. Yes. Um... Alright. Yes... They've, they've really got to me. This country is poisoning my mind! ......... But please, I beg you to defend me in court tomorrow. You can tell them what really happened. You'll do it...won't you?
Ryunosuke:
Well, erm...
Soseki:
Why?! WHY?! Why is it so hard to say 'yes' to me?!
Ryunosuke:
Well, the thing is...I'm just a student like yourself. On a study tour.
Soseki:
A, a student...?
Ryunosuke:
I have defended a case in the Old Bailey. Only the one, though. But at this moment in time, I really don't know what I'm supposed to believe in. I'm...confused about what justice in this country even means.
Susato:
Oh, Naruhodo-san...
Ryunosuke:
I'm not even the foreign student who was supposed to be here. I'm...a sort of locum lawyer, I suppose.
Soseki:
But! But that armband! That's the mark of a defence lawyer from our great empire!
Ryunosuke:
It's a keepsake from the man who should have been here. ...He was my best friend.
Soseki:
A, a keepsake? ......... I know exactly what they're saying about me.
Susato:
Oh... Who do you mean?
Soseki:
The lawyers. All the British defence lawyers. They won't defend me.
Susato:
Goodness! Why...why do say that?
Soseki:
For the same reason as you noted before. When it happened... ...there was only the victim and myself around. And I ran away from the scene of the crime. I'm not a fool. I know it looks as though I must be the culprit.
Ryunosuke:
It must be very hard for you, Soseki-san...
Soseki:
And anyway, I'm a student from overseas. I'm just a foreign nobody to them. Someone not to be trusted. I heard them openly laughing about me before. In my earshot, without any compunction at all. 'Any trial for this man would be a waste of time,' they said. And, 'Of course the foreigner did it!' They even had the gall to say, 'The man doesn't understand half of what's being said anyway!'
Ryunosuke:
That's awful...!
Soseki:
They're wrong! I've studied more English than half of the policemen out there on the streets! I've travelled halfway around the world to learn about these people's country and its great history! But no one here wants to listen to a man with a strange accent. They all hate me! So...at the very least... ...I'd like to entrust my fate to someone who can listen to me, in my native tongue.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Soseki:
You could do it. ...Couldn't you? When I look into your eyes, I can see it. I can see what you've been through.
Ryunosuke:
...Soseki-san, it's just that... ......... Give me a little time, please.
Soseki:
Hm?
Ryunosuke:
I'll do what I can, for the time being.
Soseki:
What do you mean?
Susato:
We shall investigate the case as thoroughly as possible. If we can find some clues, it will give us a much better chance, I'm sure!
Soseki:
......... Oh yes! Yes! Thank you! I'll be here! All alone! Waiting for you...Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire!
Susato:
We should be going then, Naruhodo-san. We have a case to prepare for!

Susato:
Ah! Look, Mr Naruhodo! Look at that regulation metal helmet! It's unmistakable! The men of Scotland Yard are here! They're investigating as we speak!
Ryunosuke:
That...is their job, you know?
Susato:
But Mr Naruhodo! To see one with my own eyes! They're often depicted in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' but I never dreamt I'd ever come this close... ...to a real bobby's helmet!
Ryunosuke:
What? The, the helmet?
Susato:
Hee hee! Of course! ...I have to try one on one day!
Ryunosuke:
Well, I...hope your hatty dream comes true. Hm, I don't see Inspector Gregson anywhere. Shall we see if we can sneak past and investigate the scene of the stabbing?
Susato:
Why should we sneak?
Ryunosuke:
I don't want to upset one of those bobbies and be butted on the head by one of those metal helmets. My skull would crack in two, I'm sure.
Susato:
Oh no, an English bobby would never do such a thing! This is a land of gentlemen, you know.

Examine
Red brick building
Susato:
That's a rather typical old brick building, isn't it? I'm sure it has a long and interesting history.
Ryunosuke:
Well, time certainly seems to have taken its toll on the place. It's crooked and sagging all over. (In fact, it looks in decidedly worse shape than the other houses around here...)
Susato:
We must find some cheap lodgings ourselves as soon as possible.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, you're right. Cheap, but ideally with reasonably level floors...
Bricked-up windows
Ryunosuke:
Oh, look at the windows of that building there.
Susato:
Are you sure they're windows...?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, but they're all filled in with bricks!
Susato:
Oh! You're right! ...I wonder why. Perhaps it's an empty property where nobody lives at the moment.
Ryunosuke:
There's smoke coming from the chimneys, though.
Susato:
Oh dear, everything still feels very foreign. There's so much we have to learn about this place.
Bicycle
Susato:
Oh! A British bicycle, look! Although the wheel is so misshapen, I'm sure it couldn't possibly be ridden any more.
Ryunosuke:
Someone must have been doing some breakneck cycling.
Susato:
It seems bicycles have become extremely popular in London recently. There's even a movement to change women's dress to allow them to ride as well.
Ryunosuke:
The bicycle fad won't last. I don't see why anyone would want to ride something like that.
Susato:
Goodness! Do you dislike bicycles?
Ryunosuke:
No! Not at all! I mean, it's not that I dislike them exactly. It's just that any occupation that involves taking both your feet off firm ground seems...reckless. If you'd ever tried walking on stilts and fallen into a river, I know you'd agree with me.
Susato:
...We'll have to hire a bicycle sometime. You can sit behind me while I ride you around.
Clouds or building silhouettes
Ryunosuke:
The clouds look so big and heavy in the sky, don't they? And with the dense fog as well, everything looks hazy.
Susato:
Well, it is known as foggy London town.
Ryunosuke:
I can just make out some sort of spire through the fog. It looks like it's still being built, though.
Susato:
Ah-ha! Yes! That must be the Crystal Tower, being built for the Great Exhibition that's to open in six months' time. Apparently it's going to be very striking. Glazed on all sides, and the symbolic centrepiece of the exhibition!
Ryunosuke:
It's to be the largest exposition in history, is it? (I can't even begin to imagine it.)
Chimneys on left
Ryunosuke:
Do you see all the black smoke rising from the chimneys over there?
Susato:
It says here that in Great Britain, many people heat their homes in winter using coal.
Ryunosuke:
The only chimneys I really remember seeing in Japan were on top of the bathhouse. Do you think some of those houses could be on fire?
Susato:
Not at all.
Ryunosuke:
Well, even so... ...that much thick smoke billowing up to the heavens is surely going to turn the whole sky black sooner or later.
Susato:
Gosh...you may be right about that...
Road in middle
Ryunosuke:
There are piles of snow on the pavement here and there, but the road itself is covered in carriage tracks.
Susato:
It seems carriages often travel down Briar Road. It soon disperses all the snow.
Ryunosuke:
I slipped over when I was walking down the pavement earlier. It seems like it would be far safer to walk on the road instead.
Susato:
Oh, but you're rather small, Mr Naruhodo. And dressed all in black. I worry coachmen might not see you, and you could be flattened by horses.
Ryunosuke:
...Well, thank you for the 'rather small' concern.
Officer
Ryunosuke:
That's one of the officers from Scotland Yard. The police are making sure the crime scene is undisturbed. I have a feeling that if we wander too close, we'll be clapped in irons.
Susato:
I think perhaps you're being a little overcautious. We've done nothing wrong, so we have no cause for concern.
Ryunosuke:
Oh no, I'm not getting caught out again. Twice is enough! Twice I've found myself in handcuffs despite not knowing a thing about what was going on.
Susato:
Yes, you've had some dreadful experiences... I'm sure that it's that wide-eyed look of panic you're so prone to. It does you no favours at all.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Sidewalk with barriers
Ryunosuke:
This patch of pavement must be where the incident occurred.
Susato:
Yes. It's a very wide, open space, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
(That's true. I can't see anywhere an attacker could have been hiding.)
Bobby:
Oi! What are you foreigners doin' 'ere?
Susato:
Agh!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um...erm...we, um... J-Just investigating the scene, Officer!
Bobby:
Conspirin' with that moustached fella from Japan, are ya?
Ryunosuke:
Conspiring?!
Bobby:
Come 'ere to destroy evidence, 'ave ya? Get out of 'ere before I give you an 'idin'! Go on!
Susato:
...He shooed us away like rats.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, we should give him a wide berth, I think.
Susato:
What a disappointing experience...
Snowman
Susato:
Hee hee! What a delightful snowman!
Ryunosuke:
I didn't realise the English had a tradition of making snowmen as well. It looks a little creepy, though.
Susato:
Oh, it has a scarf, look!
Ryunosuke:
You'd need one if you were out in this freezing cold all the time. I wish I had one.
Susato:
I'm afraid our budget is somewhat frozen at the moment, too. We certainly can't afford a scarf.
Ryunosuke:
(Surely the snowman here wouldn't miss his...)
Susato:
But the person who made the snowman certainly would.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I know. You're right. Anyway... ...even if I borrowed it, it wouldn't do much to warm my neck, would it? It's covered in snow.
Carriage
Susato:
Oh! That's a Scotland Yard carriage! They use vehicles like that to rush to crime scenes and cart away criminals!
Ryunosuke:
You're very well informed, aren't you?
Susato:
It's long been a dream of mine to ride one of those through the streets of London!
Ryunosuke:
Well, just pick up a stone and throw it through one of the windows, then.
Susato:
...But that would mean being arrested in order to ride it... ...wouldn't it? Still, if it's the only way... Help me find a good stone!
Ryunosuke:
No no no! I wasn't serious!
Gregson:
What's the Japanese delegation doin' here?
Susato:
Oh! Inspector Gregson!
Gregson:
This isn't on the tourist trail, as I'm fairly sure you're well aware.
Susato:
Yes! Of course! We're here to investigate.
Gregson:
So you've been to the holdin' cells, then? What d'you make of the criminal?
Susato:
He's not a 'criminal' as you put it, Inspector. He's a suspect.
Gregson:
Hmph. We'll see about that. You Japanese like to stick together, I s'pose. Well, do what you will. It doesn't bother me. The bloke's in court tomorrow whatever happens. And the verdict's a foregone conclusion.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...the stone-cold air of rejection...)
Susato:
Take heart! London at this time of year is full of stone-cold air!
Ryunosuke:
That...makes it worse somehow...
Converse
Scotland Yard
Susato:
Tell me about Scotland Yard, Inspector! Ever since I read about it in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', I've been fascinated by the place!
Gregson:
The Yard...is the most sophisticated policin' organisation you'll find anywhere in the world, ma'am.
Susato:
Oh, and you know I've always dreamt of wearing a real bobby's helmet!
Ryunosuke:
It does make them look the part. Seeing that policeman there with his helmet on... ...you certainly get the sense that this is a man who will take no nonsense in his duty of protecting the city.
Susato:
Oh yes! Doesn't he look wonderful?
Gregson:
Bein' a London bobby is hard going, I can tell you.
Susato:
Oh, really?
Gregson:
First thing in the mornin', you know what he does? Goes round and rouses all the labourers on his beat so they can get off to work.
Ryunosuke:
What? He wakes people up?
Gregson:
Yup. Raps on their windows with a long pole. Did it myself, goin' back a bit.
Susato:
I had no idea...
Gregson:
The bobby works for the people of the town. It's just another one of his duties. After that, he starts tirelessly patrolling the streets all day long. He has to cover twenty miles a day. That's the regulation distance.
Ryunosuke:
I can't really imagine how far that is, but it sounds like a long way.
Susato:
Let me see... Twenty miles... That's approximately the distance from Tokyo to Yokohama.
Ryunosuke:
On foot?! That's...that's definitely taking things a step too far!
Gregson:
And when it gets dark, of course, he has the important job of lightin' all the gas street lamps.
Susato:
Oh my... 
Ryunosuke:
And I suppose in between all of those duties, bobbies are expected to investigate cases as well?
Susato:
And chase after criminals trying to evade the law!
Gregson:
I'm not sure you could call it 'in between' exactly. More 'alongside'. But yes... ...they're expected to handle those jobs as well. We do have men keelin' over from time to time, I admit.
Susato:
......... I'd always dreamt of wearing one of those helmets, as I said. But it's with a heavy heart, that I shall have to relinquish that dream to you, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
...Your heavy heart will be my heavy head if you do.
About the case
Gregson:
It happened at around five in the evenin', two days ago. Just there, on that open bit of pavement. The victim - a young woman - was stabbed with a blade from behind.
Ryunosuke:
Is it right that the lady is still unconscious now? You mentioned that she's being treated in hospital.
Gregson:
...I never said she was a 'lady'. Truth is, unless she comes round pretty smartish, we won't be able to find out much about her at all.
Ryunosuke:
(I suppose that means they haven't been able to take a statement from her, of course...)
Gregson:
Here's a map of the local area I happen to have on me. You can take it if you want.
Ryunosuke:
Really? Are you sure?
Gregson:
It's Yard policy to give lawyers defendin' suspects the odd bit of information to go on.
Ryunosuke:
(I haven't actually accepted the job yet, but still...)
Susato:
Thank you, Inspector! We gratefully accept!
The local map has been entered into the Court Record.
Gregson:
Anyway... ...as far as we know, there was no one else on the scene other than the victim and your fellow countryman. So who did it, do you think? Not much of a head-scratcher, is it?
Ryunosuke:
Well, I know Mr Natsume is also claiming not to have seen anyone else around, but-
Susato:
But just because he didn't see anyone... ...it doesn't mean we can be sure that nobody else was present!
Gregson:
I'm sorry to have to tell you, but we most certainly can be sure.
Susato:
...How?
Gregson:
Because, ma'am... ...the precise moment of the stabbing didn't go unnoticed.
Ryunosuke:
It... What?!
Gregson:
We have two very reliable witnesses no less!
Susato:
Ah!
Gregson:
It was a typical foggy London day, and your client obviously didn't see them.
Ryunosuke:
(There were witnesses now...?)
Witnesses (appears after "About the case")
Ryunosuke:
Who are these witnesses, Inspector?
Gregson:
A fellow and his wife. And the man's one of the most reliable and respected citizens in all of London. He's a copper from Scotland Yard.
Susato:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
A, a policeman? (That...might change things.)
Susato:
And this policeman just happened to be there at the exact moment the woman was attacked?
Gregson:
Nothin' peculiar about that, ma'am. Part and parcel of bein' a bobby. Catchin' them bang in the act and all that.
Ryunosuke:
Um, do you think it might be possible... ...for us to ask that policeman a few questions?
Gregson:
Be my guest. You can ask him what you like...in court tomorrow!
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Gregson:
I've no doubt he'll be summoned as a witness. So, that'll give you something to look forward to!
Ryunosuke:
(That's that then... He's got no intention of letting us meet the man beforehand, it seems.)
Susato:
A policeman witnessed the incident... As your judicial assistant, I must warn you that this could make our job very difficult indeed!
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, as a non-judicial assistant, I could have warned me of that, too. Oh yes, one more thing, Inspector...
Gregson:
What?
Ryunosuke:
The person who led you to the suspect... I hear that was Mr Herlock Sholmes.
Gregson:
......... What are you bringin' him up for? .........
Ryunosuke:
(Was it something I said? The colour has drained from his cheeks...)
Tomorrow's trial
Gregson:
That twitchy Japanese bloke goes on trial tomorrow. Are you goin' to defend him or not?
Ryunosuke:
Well, erm...
Gregson:
......... Makes no difference to me, but I will just say this: No London lawyer worth his salt would touch that case with a barge pole.
Ryunosuke:
Because the prosecution is being handled by the Reaper of the Bailey, you mean?
Gregson:
There's no way to save the man now. It's a waste of time tryin'. It is all a bit strange, though...
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gregson:
The Reaper... He hasn't appeared in court once for a good few years now.
Susato:
Yes, we did hear something to that effect.
Gregson:
And the only people he usually bothers with are the real scum. The master criminals. The violent ones.
Ryunosuke:
M-Master criminals?
Susato:
The, the violent ones?
Gregson:
That's right. He hand picks his victims. Only deals with those guaranteed to go to the gallows for their sins.
Ryunosuke:
But! Mr Natsume wouldn't hang for what he's accused of, surely?
Gregson:
That's just my point, sunshine. Yes, the young woman was stabbed, but it didn't kill her. Couldn't even say the intent was there. So this isn't the sort of case I'd be expectin' the Reaper to want to sink his teeth into, for want of a better phrase.
Ryunosuke:
Well, it's not exactly a minor infraction, is it?
Gregson:
...No, there's got to be more to it. Some reason he's takin' an interest...
Susato:
Really? What sort of reason, Inspector?
Gregson:
You think I can tell what's goin' on inside the head of that lord of darkness? You'll have to ask him yourself...at tomorrow's trial.
Ryunosuke:
(Are we really going to have to face the Reaper again? The lord of darkness, as he put it.)
Mr Sholmes (appears after "Witnesses")
Gregson:
......... Who did you hear that name from?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, well, um... It was Mr Natsume who mentioned it. He said that Mr Sholmes was with the police when they entered his lodgings.
Susato:
I'm sure it was the result of one of Mr Sholmes's inspirational great deductions!
Gregson:
Fiddle-Faddle!
Susato:
Agh!
Gregson:
The man's an amateur! And I'm gettin' sick and tired of him showin' his mug everywhere!
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Gregson:
I don't know where he gets his information from, but he turns up at the scene of the crime... ...wanders around spoutin' incomprehensible rubbish, and before you know it... ...he claims to have solved the case!
Ryunosuke:
Yes... He's quite...astounding, isn't he?
Susato:
He, he is a great help to Scotland Yard though...isn't he?
Gregson:
Gibble-Gabble!
Susato:
Agh!
Gregson:
Ever seen this before?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes... That's Randst Magazine.
Susato:
The wonderful publication in which 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' appears!
Gregson:
Yes, well, that 'wonderful' publication, as you put it, sees fit to include several of the Yard's detectives in its stories. And the so-called great detective makes a mockery of all of us! If you ask anyone at the Yard, it's a misadventure to be included in any Herlock Sholmes tale at all!
Susato:
Well...I suppose there is an element of that...
Gregson:
We work our socks off, every one of us! Only to be frumped by the public thanks to that obnoxious detective! The man's as dangerous to us at Scotland Yard as he is to all our criminals!
Susato:
That can't really be true, can it, Inspector?
Ryunosuke:
(Clearly the great detective and the police have a... complex relationship.)
Present
Armband
Ryunosuke:
Inspector Gregson, could I show you this?
Gregson:
Am I supposed to know what that is? I've never seen that insignia before.
Ryunosuke:
It's worn by defence lawyers in the Empire of Japan. As a symbol of their profession.
Gregson:
...In other words, it's a worthless trinket here in Great Britain.
Ryunosuke:
Oh no! It's very important to me. It, it shows my spirit!
Gregson:
An English gentleman keeps things like his spirit very much to himself, I'll have you know.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Susato:
Don't give up, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
It's too late... He's crushed my spirit already.
Local Map
Ryunosuke:
Thank you again for this.
Gregson:
Hmph. Don't mention it. I had someone at the Yard fish it out for me. But in the end, I didn't need it.
Ryunosuke:
Oh?
Gregson:
Well, the case could hardly be simpler, could it? I don't need a map to work out what happened. You can throw it away when you're done with it.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... Cold...)
After clearing all Converse options:
Ryunosuke:
(Well... I don't think we're going to get any more useful information out of the detective.)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, can I make a suggestion?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes, what is it?
Susato:
Well, it seems to me... ...that we MUST speak with him about this!
Ryunosuke:
......... By 'him', do you mean... ...Mr Sholmes?
Susato:
Yes! Mr Herlock Sholmes! Exactly!
Ryunosuke:
(Look at those shining eyes! You can't wait, can you?) Well, Mr Natsume did blame Mr Sholmes for all of this, didn't he?
Susato:
Yes, he did! He really did! Which makes him an involved party in the case. Are you just going to ignore that? ...I hope not! ...I assure you, it's not simply my selfish desire to meet with Mr Sholmes again!
Ryunosuke:
The trouble is... ...we have no idea of the man's address, even. So how-
Susato:
It's Baker Street!
Ryunosuke:
H-How do you know that?
Susato:
It's in the stories, of course! 221B Baker Street... The most famous address in the world!
Ryunosuke:
Oh...I see... Well, there's nothing to stop us from going, I suppose... (We'd better try to find our way there before Susato-san gets any more excited and unpredictable...)
Susato:
Hurrah! I'll summon a carriage!
Ryunosuke:
(So, we're to have a reunion already... ...with the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes.)
19th February
Local Prison, Cell 9
Susato:
...It seems that we can't meet with Mr Natsume at the moment.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Susato:
He's being briefed about his appearance in court tomorrow, apparently.
Ryunosuke:
I see. (Yes, the trial is only a day away...) Alright then, let's come back later.
Susato:
Yes.
Ryunosuke:
(I really hope he's not answering any more questions with inappropriate textbook answers like, 'Yes, I do!')
Sholmes's Suite
Anime cutscene
Ryunosuke:
Thank you very much.
Man:
It's just up there, overlooking the street. Good day.
Ryunosuke:
Thanks again. This is it...the residence of Mr Herlock Sholmes.
19th February, 12:53 p.m.
Sholmes's Suite
Ryunosuke:
So this is where the great detective makes his living... (It feels surreal to be here somehow...) Is it as described in the stories, Miss Susato?
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Um...Susato-san?
Susato:
Many, many famous cases have been solved here in this very room.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! I, I suppose they must have been, yes... (I've never read the stories, so it's hard to get quite as excited about it as she seems to be...)
Susato:
The detective chases the villain relentlessly as he disappears into the fog down an unlit London street... Oh, the thrill of it! The romanticism! Can't you feel your heart thumping in your chest? Can't you, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! I, I suppose I can, yes...
Susato:
So, if you don't mind... ...I'll just stand here and soak up the atmosphere for a while longer. Please, don't mind me.
Ryunosuke:
Haah... (She's obsessed... Well... ...it looks like our detective friend isn't home at present.) Excuse me! Is anybody home?
???:
Oh! Do we have a visitor? Hello! Is it a big new case for Mr Sholmes?
Ryunosuke:
Erm...hello. ......... Wait. Aren't you...?
???:
Oh! How rude of me! I'll go and make some tea at once!
Ryunosuke:
(I'm sure it's the same girl...) Miss Susato! Did you see the girl who was just here?
Susato:
Oh yes... Isn't it truly extraordinary? To think that the King of Bohemia came to this very room to ask Mr Sholmes to take on his case...
Ryunosuke:
The, the King of Bo-where-ia?
Susato:
King Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, of course!
Ryunosuke:
...Sorry, I'm drawing a blank. Forget 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' for a moment, and look over there!
???:
The tea's brewed! And I have a freshly baked cake as well!
Susato:
Ah! It's you!
Ryunosuke:
(I knew it. Susato-san recognises her, too.)
???:
Ah! There you are!And taking that with you as well! I was looking forward to the trial run of my experimental smoke grenade launcher! Oh, good day to you! I'm...well, the inventor, I suppose, of that machine.
Ryunosuke:
(It's the girl who turned up at the end of Mr McGilded's trial in the defendants' antechamber.)
???:
I've never met a lawyer from the Far East before! Poor you, having to get straight to work when you've only just arrived in London.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, it was...challenging.
???:
Well, try this tea. It's my special blend, you know!
Ryunosuke:
Oh...um, thank you. (Is tea supposed to look that colour?)
Susato:
Oh my! What a fragrant yet mellow flavour!
???:
Hurray! It's a winner! I tried blending different leaves designed to alleviate fatigue, you see. You must be exhausted after your long voyage here. And you have another ticklish trial tomorrow! Oh, and you're to defend a Japanese man. I do wish you lots and lots of luck!
Ryunosuke:
Erm...
Susato:
Did Mr Sholmes tell you about us, by any chance?
???:
Oh! You know Hurley, do you?
Ryunosuke:
(...'Hurley'? 'Mr Sholmes' to you, surely?)
Susato:
Mr Sholmes was a fellow passenger on the boat that brought us to Great Britain, you see.
???:
Was he really? Well, I had no idea! I'm afraid Hurley's out on an errand again today, even though he's just returned from overseas.
Ryunosuke:
(Wait a minute... We met this girl for the first time ever yesterday after the trial. And only briefly at that. How on earth does she know so much about us?) Did she...deduce...all those things, do you think...?
Susato:
And perhaps more to the point... ...why is she here in Mr Sholmes's suite?
???:
Oh! Silly me! I haven't introduced myself, have I?
Iris:
It's a great pleasure to meet you both. My name is Iris Wilson. I live here together with Hurley.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, Iris, is it? What a lovely name!
Susato:
WHAT?!
Ryunosuke:
What's the matter?
Susato:
No, wait, this, this can't be... Did, did you... Did you say that your, your name is...'Wilson'?
Ryunosuke:
(What's the matter with Susato-san? Why is she so flustered all of a sudden?)
Iris:
Yes, that's right! And what are your names?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, um...I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo, a lawyer from Japan.
Susato:
......... Oh! Sorry... I'm Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant, Susato Mikotoba. It's wonderful to meet you!
Iris:
Lovely! Susie and Runo... Got it!
Susato:
'Susie'...?
Ryunosuke:
And 'Runo'...? (There's more to this girl than meets the eye... I have so many questions for her, I don't know where to start!)
Susato:
Yes, and so do I!
Examine
Large machine on left desk
Ryunosuke:
What on earth is this huge, over-the-top machine?
Iris:
That's the 'Great Analytiscope'. It can analyse anything, really. Anything at all!
Susato:
That's... That's absolutely incredible!
Iris:
It's one of Hurley's inventions. It took him a whole year! He said it was to help him with his investigations.
Susato:
What sort of things has he analysed with it? Do you know?
Iris:
Well...actually...he hasn't used it for anything yet.
Susato:
Oh...
Ryunosuke:
Why not?
Iris:
Apparently, on the evening he finally completed it, it suddenly occurred to him... 'I don't actually have anything I need to analyse.'
Susato:
Oh dear...
Iris:
How about you, Runo? Do you have anything you'd like to analyse?
Ryunosuke:
...The only thing that springs to mind is this machine itself.
Bookshelf behind violin
Ryunosuke:
There's all sorts on these shelves: chemistry apparatus, books, papers and...lots of things I've never seen before. It's all heaped up so high, I can't help feeling that the whole lot is going to topple at any moment.
Iris:
I keep telling Hurley not to cram so much on those shelves.
Ryunosuke:
...Good advice.
Iris:
He wanted to look something up in one of those books a while ago. But it was so tightly wedged in, he couldn't get it out. So he went and bought a new copy instead.
Violin
Ryunosuke:
Ah, I've seen pictures of Western musical instruments like this. It's called a violin, isn't it?
Susato:
Of course it is! Mr Sholmes is renowned for his violin playing!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, really?
Susato:
Absolutely! It's often explained in the stories. It's inspirational, Mr Naruhodo. Inspirational! I immediately started playing the koto, which was the closest Japanese stringed instrument I could find.
Ryunosuke:
...What a shame you couldn't bring it with you to London.
Susato:
Oh, yes. Well... ...Papa was beaming when I asked him if he would buy me one. But after a while, he asked if I would only practise when he was out of the house. So...now it's merely an ornament in my room.
Ryunosuke:
(That must have been an awkward conversation...)
Violin (after speaking to Iris Wilson about "'Wilson'")
Ryunosuke:
Ah, I've seen pictures of Western musical instruments like this. It's called a violin, isn't it?
Susato:
Of course it is! Mr Sholmes is renowned for his violin playing!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, really?
Iris:
That's right. I just sort of slipped that in.
Ryunosuke:
You did what, Iris?
Iris:
I didn't really give it a lot of thought, and just started adding it in to the stories.
Susato:
Yes. Mr Sholmes's exceptional violin playing has been mentioned a number of times.
Iris:
But the truth is, Hurley had barely touched a violin in his life up to that point.
Susato:
Oh...
Iris:
Of course, people started asking him to play for them after my stories were published. And he wasn't able to tell them that he didn't know how.
Susato:
What did he do?!
Iris:
He went straight to the pawnshop and bought himself a very nice violin. And then he practised. He practised until his fingers very nearly dropped off.
Ryunosuke:
(...Must be why he's so highly strung.)
Iris:
Before I knew it, he'd become rather good. The greatness of the great detective really shone with that experience, I think!
Ryunosuke:
...It was a great deception, that's for sure.
Initials on wall
Ryunosuke:
Why...why are there all those bullet holes in the wall up there?! Was Mr Sholmes trying to shoot a pestery fly or something?
Susato:
Mr Sholmes...would never do something so reckless.
Ryunosuke:
No?
Susato:
Those are the letters 'V.R.', standing for 'Victoria Regina'. It's Latin for Queen Victoria.
Ryunosuke:
So you mean...he shot the Queen into the wall?
Susato:
In a moment of boredom, Mr Sholmes adorned the wall with a patriotic sign, that's all. As pistol practice.
Ryunosuke:
Right, that...makes perfect sense now.
Susato:
It's exactly as it's described in the stories! Oh, this is delightful!
Ryunosuke:
I'm not sure that the real explanation is any less reckless than shooting at a fly, personally.
Susato:
It's patriotic, Mr Naruhodo! Patriotic!
Fireplace
Ryunosuke:
I do like this fireplace. It's one of the best things I've seen since we arrived in the country, in fact. Lingering beside the fire and watching the flames flicker and dance in the grate... Ah, it's so relaxing...
Susato:
We can't relax! Not when there are so many interesting things on the mantelpiece! Oh, it's just as it was described in the stories!
Ryunosuke:
It is?
Susato:
Yes! Exactly! Inside that Persian slipper, for example-
Iris:
...Are my chocolates for elevenses!
Susato:
And transfixed by that large jackknife-
Iris:
...Is my shopping list for the market!
Susato:
......... Oh, it's...not quite how I remember it being described in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'...
Ryunosuke:
(Poor Susato-san. She looks crushed.)
Chest
Ryunosuke:
It looks like that huge metal chest is being used as a table for tea and coffee. It seems very sturdy, with an equally sturdy lock.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! You mustn't go around opening things! I always have to keep an eye on you, don't I? You're very mischievous.
Ryunosuke:
(...How did you come to that conclusion?)
Iris:
Ooh, that chest... ...contains some of my most valuable things!
Ryunosuke:
(And that smile tells me you're not going to give us any clue about what they are...)
Shelf to the right of fireplace
Susato:
A mystery shoe, a curious hammer, some mysterious dancing men, a bust of Napoleon... Aah, what an entrancing collection!
Ryunosuke:
...This is the first time in my life that I've seen a lonely old shoe displayed as an ornament.
Iris:
Oh, those are all mementoes that Hurley has collected from his past cases.
Ryunosuke:
Really? Even the bust?
Iris:
Yes, that's right. When the mood takes him, he likes to throw it on the floor and smash it to dust.
Ryunosuke:
The poor, defenceless emperor? ...Mr Sholmes destroys it?
Iris:
Yes, and then he buys a new one.
Ryunosuke:
...You make it sound like he has the temperament of an insane sculptor.
Susato:
Aah, how entrancingly bohemian of him!
Tea set on cart or table
Ryunosuke:
What a beautiful English tea set. And so neatly arranged.
Iris:
It's a favourite pastime of mine, a cup of herbal tea in the afternoon.
Susato:
Tea...made of herbs?
Iris:
That's right. I grow all sorts of herbs in the garden, so I can experiment with different blends. One moment! Don't go away! I'll brew a pot of the special blend I came up with earlier today!
Ryunosuke:
(She looks delighted. ...I only hope it's safe to drink.)
Blackboard
Iris:
Ah, that's my blackboard where I note down ideas.
Ryunosuke:
Ooh, interesting. Let's see... 'Black Peter'...? (What does that mean?)
Susato:
Don't you want to hear what Iris has to say, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
(...I'll come back to that blackboard later.)
Blackboard (after speaking to Iris Wilson about "'Wilson'")
Iris:
Ah, that's my blackboard where I note down ideas.
Ryunosuke:
'Black Peter'...? (What does that mean?)
Susato:
Ooh, how intriguing! It must be the title of Iris's latest work! Oh my! I wonder what fantastic tale awaits us!
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san looks like an angel, but I bet she's dreaming of the most grisly crime you could imagine.)
Iris:
It's a case that Hurley solved just recently. A black cat called Peter went missing in the neighborhood. Hurley tracked it down at the fishmonger's in the end.
Susato:
Well! I can't wait for the story to be published!
White shelf behind chandelier
Ryunosuke:
That's a charming little white shelf. And full of charming little bottles, too.
Iris:
Oh yes. But don't touch any of those. They might explode.
Ryunosuke:
E-Explode?!
Susato:
Are they exotic chemicals? Do you use them for exciting experiments?!
Iris:
Yes, indeed! And as Hurley always says... 'Chemistry is an explosive science!'
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
I agree! A single discovery can trigger an explosion of innovation all around the world!
Ryunosuke:
...Or perhaps he just meant it literally. (...Either way, mental note: Do not touch any bottle that belongs to Iris.)
Typewriter or desk on right
Ryunosuke:
What on earth is that big black lump over there?
Iris:
Ah! That fascinating thing is called a typewriter. It's a machine that allows you to write on paper without needing a pen! And wizardly quick, too!
Ryunosuke:
(Ooh, that sounds like it could be very useful for someone like me with terrible handwriting.)
Typewriter or desk on right (after speaking to Iris Wilson about "'Wilson'")
Ryunosuke:
What on earth is that big black lump over there?
Iris:
Ah! That's a typewriter. It's a machine that allows you to write on paper without needing a pen! And wizardly quick, too!
Ryunosuke:
(Ooh, that sounds like it could be very useful for someone like me with terrible handwriting.)
Susato:
Wait! Iris, are...are all the stories from 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'-
Iris:
Yes! Every one typed on this trusty machine!
Susato:
Oh! My! Goodness! ...How wonderful!
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san looks like she's been shown into the Tokyo Imperial Palace gardens.)
Converse
Iris
Ryunosuke:
It was you that we ran into yesterday, wasn't it? At the Old Bailey.
Iris:
Yes, that's right! You were ever so helpful. Thank you so much!
Susato:
Oh no, not at all. I'm so sorry we couldn't have been more welcoming.
Ryunosuke:
Though, at the time, we did have a rather large gun pointed at us.
Iris:
...Like this?
Ryunosuke:
*Gulp!*
Susato:
Ah, thinking back now, you left with Miss Lestrade in tow, didn't you?
Ryunosuke:
(Oh yes, that awkward witness, Gina Lestrade...)
Iris:
Oh, Ginny? Yes, she's a professional pickpocket.
Ryunosuke:
So we found out.
Iris:
It was very naughty of her to pinch my invention like that!
Ryunosuke:
...Are you referring to that trial disrupting, gun-like contraption?
Iris:
Exactly! So I followed her, you see, to get it back. Hm...perhaps I should think about fitting a self-destruct mechanism in my inventions...
Ryunosuke:
(This girl is dangerous.)
Iris:
Anyway, I brought Ginny back here after that. So she could apologise to my trusty technician.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry, your technician?
Iris:
Hurley, of course, silly!
Susato:
Hurley...?
Iris:
Yes, Herlock! Herlock Sholmes. We live here together.
Ryunosuke:
I, I had no idea the great detective had such an... interesting young daughter.
Iris:
Daughter? Not likely!
Ryunosuke:
What?
Iris:
I wouldn't call him Hurley if he was my father, would I?
Susato:
Well then...what is your relationship with Mr Sholmes?
Iris:
Well, I expect you've found out that lodgings of any kind in London are very expensive. So the solution is to share the cost with a partner. A roommate.
Ryunosuke:
You're...roommates?
Susato:
I hope you don't mind me asking, Iris, but...how old are you?
Iris:
Ten at last this year!
Ryunosuke:
Well, what of your mother and father?
Iris:
Oh, no... They're not around.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see... (I wonder what the story is there...)
'Wilson'
Susato:
Oh yes! There's something I must ask you!
Iris:
Of course, of course! Go ahead, Susie!
Susato:
I am a very great fan of 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', and-
Iris:
Oh! You have a copy of Randst Magazine!
Susato:
Yes! I read every issue! It's delivered all the way to Japan on a ship.
Iris:
Oh, this is so exciting! My stories are being read on the other side of the world!
Ryunosuke:
'My' stories?
Iris:
That's right. Hurley is always solving such amazing cases, you see. And he tells me all about them. They really are quite fascinating! It would be such a shame if I was the only one who ever heard them, don't you think?
Susato:
Goodness!
Iris:
Last night, he was telling me all about a new case he just solved on a steamship travelling from a faraway land. So I was just in the middle of typing up the manuscript for the next issue before you came.
Susato:
So you... You...are the author...
Iris:
Yes. I'll let you in on a secret, if you like. I'm going to call this latest adventure, 'The Speckled Band'.
Ryunosuke:
'The Speckled Band'?! (That's...certainly very familiar.)
Iris:
Of course, I always change one or two details in the stories. Here and there. This time, I had the idea of making a venomous snake be the cause of all the trouble.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! That was Mr Sholmes's first thought as well, actually.
Iris:
Yes. And of course I know that a snake might not be a credible fit for the facts of the case exactly, but... ...it's a story! Some poetic licence is justified to make it more thrilling, I think! Don't you?
Susato:
So, do you mean to say...? Are the stories about Mr Sholmes that are published in Randst Magazine...
Iris:
...All written by me? Yes! On my wonderful and very modern typewriter!
Susato:
But! But all the stories I've ever read... ...are written by a doctor of medicine! Dr John H. Wilson!
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san's getting more and more worked up...)
Iris:
Ah, yes... That's me! I mean, my name really is Wilson.
Susato:
But! But what about the doctor of medicine part?
Iris:
That's all true, too. I am a doctor of medicine.
Ryunosuke:
No! At ten years old?!
Iris:
At ten years old!
Ryunosuke:
Well... That's quite incredible.
Susato:
But! ...But, but... Dr Wilson is an English gentleman!
Iris:
Ah, yes... I did alter the setting slightly, for the stories to be more compelling.
Susato:
Oh!
Iris:
Well, it sounds a little strange, doesn't it? A great detective with a ten-year-old girl in tow.
Susato:
......... I...suppose it does, yes.
Ryunosuke:
(Poor Susato-san... She looks like her whole world has just fallen apart.)
Your deductions just now
Ryunosuke:
Um...about before...
Iris:
Yes? Yes? What's on your mind, Runo! Do tell me!
Ryunosuke:
How did you know? That I was a lawyer, and we'd just arrived in London, I mean.
Susato:
Yes... Oh! And that we have a difficult trial tomorrow! How did you know all of that?
Iris:
Oh, that's what you mean.
Susato:
Please! Tell us how you did it! Explain every detail!
Iris:
Of course! I'd be delighted. Although...there's really no mystery. Now...let's begin! Iris Wilson is proud to present...her 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! First of all, I knew already that you were a lawyer, Runo. After all, I met you yesterday at the Old Bailey in the defendants' antechamber.
Ryunosuke:
But you also said that we'd only just arrived in London. How did you know that?
Iris:
I observed a passport and travel ticket protruding from your breast pocket.
Ryunosuke:
Oh!
Iris:
So I was reasonably confident that you must have only just arrived in the country. And on top of that... ...you accepted a case against that particular prosecutor. Telling me you were unaware of London's court affairs.
Ryunosuke:
The Reaper of the Bailey? I walked right into that one, didn't I...
Iris:
Then I noticed a red ink stamp on the back of Susie's hand. You were given that when you visited the local prison to meet with a suspect, weren't you? Earlier today.
Susato:
Ah!
Iris:
They use those stamps to keep a close eye on comings and goings, you see.
Susato:
I, I didn't realise...
Iris:
And a red stamp is only used for people visiting foreign inmates. So...that told me that even though you had only yesterday concluded the trial of Magnus McGilded... ...the two of you had already had cause to visit a foreign inmate at a local prison. However, neither of you was wearing a particularly sad expression on your face. So I concluded that the prisoner was unlikely to be a friend or a relative. That led me to believe that you must have accepted a new case.
Ryunosuke:
I... I see...
Susato:
But how could you have known that the trial is tomorrow?
Iris:
Well, having barely been home a few hours yesterday, Hurley solved yet another case. It obviously amused him. He told me that he'd caught a Japanese man who was bawling and trembling.
Ryunosuke:
A Japanese man? (Well, clearly that must have been-)
Susato:
Mr Natsume!
Iris:
Now, Runo has that fancy Japanese sword. And I think your outfit is called a kimono, isn't it, Susie? Well anyway, it was clear to me that you both come from Japan yourselves. So I put two and two together and decided you must be defending the Japanese man Hurley caught! And there was only one conclusion those facts could lead me to: You both came here to ask Hurley about the case! There's a note on the mantelpiece that says the man's trial will be tomorrow. Hurley is always stabbing his notes with a knife, you know. He is silly. And...that's all there was to it, really. Thank you for listening! I'm Iris Wilson, and that was one of my 'great deductions'!
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
.........
Iris:
Well? Was it a winner? Were my deductions correct?
Ryunosuke:
They... They were spot on!
Susato:
That was amazing, Iris! Truly a great deduction!
Ryunosuke:
You even managed the 'certain something' of Mr Sholmes's delivery!
Iris:
Oh, well...I was just copying Hurley's style for that!
Susato:
This is really very good news! You could tell us all about the case involving the Japanese man. You will, won't you, Iris? Please!
The case of the Japanese man (appears after "Your deductions just now")
Ryunosuke:
So yesterday, Mr Sholmes apprehended a Japanese man, you were saying...
Iris:
Yes. Hurley had just arrived back in London after his sea voyage. But the police were waiting for him at the railway station to take him directly to the crime scene.
Ryunosuke:
Ah... (The great detective is a popular man, it seems.)
Iris:
Apparently a woman was stabbed on a quiet street somewhere in town. There were witnesses who had seen a short, shifty-looking, stooped man running away from the scene.
Susato:
A short, shifty-looking, stooped man...
Ryunosuke:
Mr Natsume, beyond any doubt. (Soseki-san said that he didn't see anybody else on the street at all. But it seems there were witnesses after all.)
Iris:
Hurley used his great deductive powers to determine the man's address. It was a lodging room, very nearby. He went directly there with the police, and what did they find? A short, shifty-looking, stooped man, shivering in fear.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... Mr Sholmes's great deduction certainly hit the mark that time.
Susato:
Of course it did! He's a great detective!
Ryunosuke:
...Still, that means the incident occurred only two days ago. Surely tomorrow is too soon for the trial, isn't it?
Susato:
Definitely. We have no time to investigate properly!
Iris:
Hurley says that London is rife with crime.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Iris:
Scotland Yard is doing its best, but they can't stay on top of it, apparently.
Susato:
Oh dear. I hadn't realised the situation was so dire.
Iris:
That's why they can't afford to spend too much time investigating cases and trying the criminals in court. Staff and money are both short. Crimes are usually pinned on the first suspicious person.
Susato:
That's terrible! I suppose it's the harsh reality of the workings of the world's greatest justice system...
Ryunosuke:
I, I suppose it is... (But in that case... ...I don't hold out much hope for Soseki-san.)
Present
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Iris, could I show you this...
Iris:
Oh, how exciting! What is it? Tell me all about it!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, actually, I was hoping you might be able to tell me something about it, if anything comes to mind?
Iris:
Why would it?
Ryunosuke:
Well... No, I suppose it wouldn't.
Iris:
Tell me, tell me! I want to hear everything!
Ryunosuke:
(This hasn't gone according to plan...)
After clearing all Converse options:
Ryunosuke:
Thank you for answering so many of our questions, Iris. This has been very informative.
Iris:
Oh, you're most welcome! I've had so much fun!
Ryunosuke:
...Do you happen to know where Mr Sholmes is at the moment? As you guessed, we'd like to ask him some questions about this case as well.
Iris:
Ah well... ...I expect Hurley is still investigating the scene.
Ryunosuke:
Of the case involving Mr Natsume, you mean?
Iris:
Yes, Mr Nuts...ooh-may? Hurley said he was going to the man's lodgings. If you leave now, you'll probably catch him there.
Susato:
Iris! Do you know where those lodgings are?
Iris:
Well...I imagine the police are still investigating the scene of the crime themselves, aren't they? Did you happen to come across a detective by the name of Gregson when you were there?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, we know Inspector Gregson.
Iris:
Ah, goody. In that case... ...give Gregsy this from me, would you? If you do that, I'm sure he'll tell you what you want to know.
Ryunosuke:
What is this?
Susato:
A five shilling piece and a postcard, it seems...
Iris's postcard has been entered into the Court Record.
Susato:
It reads: 'Tell the gentleman in black whatever he wants to know. I trust that won't be a problem?' Gosh! This will make the inspector help us, will it?
Ryunosuke:
...Well, thank you, Iris. We'll give it a try.
Iris:
Good luck, then! I'm going to return to writing my manuscript. 'The Speckled Band'! And I'll be making more special blends of tea, so come back again soon!
Susato:
We'd be delighted! Thank you so much, Iris. Well, Mr Naruhodo...it's back to the scene of the crime!
Ryunosuke:
So, somewhat dubious that they would exert any influence over the men of Scotland Yard at all... ...we headed back to the scene with Iris's curious note and one of the world's heaviest silver coins in hand.
To be continued...
19th February, 2:38 p.m.
Briar Road
Ryunosuke:
It looks as though the police are still here, carrying on with their investigation.
Susato:
Perfect! So let's find Inspector Gregson as quickly as possible!
Ryunosuke:
Yes... And let's see if he'll take a break from his chips to look at that silver 'tip' Iris gave us for him!
Present
Iris's Postcard
Leads to:
"Erm, Inspector Gregson...do you have a moment?"
Ryunosuke:
Erm, Inspector Gregson...do you have a moment?
Gregson:
I'm sorry to say I don't. I'm a very busy man. Much too busy to talk to a pair of foreign gadabouts, that's for sure.
Susato:
We have these for you. A present...from Miss Iris Wilson.
Gregson:
WHAAAAAAT?! For me?! From Her Ladyship?
Ryunosuke:
Her Ladyship?
Gregson:
Give that here! At once! Come on! Hand it over! That's for me!
Ryunosuke:
Agh! (Don't wait for me to give it to you, will you?)
Ryunosuke:
Um...what was that coin exactly?
Gregson:
It's a silver crown, obviously. But it's a lot more than that. It's...well... It's an appearance fee, that's what it is!
Susato:
An appearance fee? ...Oh! I see. You mean...
Gregson:
That's right. For 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. Her Ladyship always offers me a little financial reward for featurin' me. Every time!
Susato:
Yes! Yes, of course! ...I know all about your exploits, Inspector! I read them avidly!
Gregson:
'Course, her usin' my name without my say-so does make me the butt of a lot of unpleasant jokes, but still.
Ryunosuke:
I am sorry, Inspector. That must be difficult for you.
Gregson:
Never you mind that! So...what d'you want to know then, eh?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gregson:
'Tell the gentleman in black whatever he wants to know. I trust that won't be a problem?' it says. Well obviously it's not a problem! Go on, fire away. What d'you want to know?
Susato:
Well, if you wouldn't mind, Inspector... ...we'd very much like to know the address of Mr Natsume's lodgings!
Gregson:
Ah, the little knife-wieldin', moustached Japanese fellow? He lives in a right old hovel. It's just over there, look. On the first floor of that house on the corner where that wreck of a bicycle's propped up.
Susato:
...That is nearby indeed.
Gregson:
If I remember rightly, the landlord is a Mr John Garrideb. ...Right, well... If you see her again, you make sure you give Her Ladyship my regards, you hear? I mean it! You tell her that Gregson sends his very best wishes!
Ryunosuke:
D-Don't worry, Inspector. We will.
Gregson:
Goodbye for now then. And long live Her Ladyship!
Susato:
Well, at least he told us what we wanted to know before he left.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. So then, shall we go and see what we can find in Mr Natsume's lodgings?
Susato:
Definitely!
Examine
Red brick building
Susato:
That's a rather typical old brick building, isn't it? I'm sure it has a long and interesting history.
Ryunosuke:
Well, time certainly seems to have taken its toll on the place. It's crooked and sagging all over. (In fact, it looks in decidedly worse shape than the other houses around here...)
Susato:
According to Inspector Gregson, that's the house where Mr Natsume has lodgings.
Ryunosuke:
Just across the road from where the incident took place, I see. (It must be awful for Soseki-san, getting caught up in something like this in a foreign land.)
19th February
Mr Natsume's Lodgings
Maid:
...May I help you?
Ryunosuke:
Ah, yes, would this be the residence of...Mr John Garrideb?
Maid:
Indeed it would, sir. And who may I say is calling?
Ryunosuke:
My name is Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I, erm...
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo is representing Mr Soseki Natsume. I believe he takes lodgings here?
Maid:
...!
Susato:
We would very much like to ask him some questions about our client.
Maid:
...! ...One moment, please. I shall convey the message to Mr Garrideb.
Ryunosuke:
Did you see that, Miss Susato?! That was a real-life English maid!
Susato:
I know! As I understand it, anyone of standing in English society employs a number of household staff. But that was the first time I've ever seen one in the flesh! Oh, this day keeps getting better!
Ryunosuke:
It certainly feels like we've really arrived now, doesn't it?
Susato:
We need only to meet a butler, and the experience will be complete!
Ryunosuke:
Well, I'm not sure if I'd go that far, but...I understand the sentiment.
Maid:
Thank you for waiting. Mr Garrideb will see you now. This way.
Examine
John Garrideb or maid
Garrideb:
Good day to you. John Garrideb, at your service.
Susato:
Pleased to meet you, sir. This is Ryunosuke Naruhodo. He's a defence lawyer.
Garrideb:
Do excuse me not getting up. Took a shot to the knee a few years back in the Battle of Maiwand, don't you know. Earned a medal for my pains, but had to withdraw from service. Handed over the reins to the up-and-comings.
Ryunosuke:
(So he's a retired soldier...)
Garrideb:
It's a hell of a job getting up and down stairs now, I can tell you. Don't get out much, as you can imagine.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it's quite a climb up here to the second floor, isn't it? I was panting at the top of the stairs.
Susato:
You really must take more exercise, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...do you think so?
Susato:
Well, Mr Garrideb, no doubt you were very courageous to earn yourself a medal.
Garrideb:
Oh, it was nothing. The medal's just a folderol, really. Wouldn't like to offend the general, though. So I grudgingly displayed it on the wall. Why don't you fetch it down, Joan? Let these good people see it properly.
Maid:
.........
Garrideb:
Joan! Fetch the- AAAAAARGH!!! Dash it all, woman! Be careful!
Maid:
Oh! Dearie me! I do beg your pardon, sir!
Garrideb:
Hmph! You jolly nearly took the skin off my hands!
Maid:
I shall be more careful, sir.
Garrideb:
So anyway, there you have it. Living the quiet life now.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...I see.
Garrideb:
Now then, I hear you want to know about the chap lodging downstairs. Is that right?
Susato:
Yes! We would be very grateful if you could answer some questions for us.
Garrideb:
Only too pleased, naturally. Especially if it helps to keep the peace here in Blighty. We've forged an alliance with the Empire of Japan recently, as I'm sure you're aware. So this case is very much in public eye, as it were.
Ryunosuke:
...Oh, is it?
Garrideb:
Even had some famous detective poking around, you know. In this old house, would you believe?
Susato:
Yes! Mr Herlock Sholmes!
Garrideb:
Hmph, could have been. Didn't catch the chap's name. Not really my cup of tea, all that detective business.
Susato:
Oh, but...you have a copy of Randst Magazine here, so...
Garrideb:
Eh? Hm? Ah...no, erm...
Maid:
Anyway, the chap's investigating the foreigner's room as we speak.
Ryunosuke:
(So he's in Soseki-san's room...)
Garrideb:
It's a bally nuisance, is what it is. The whole neighbourhood's twitching its curtains now. I don't like all this fuss. It's jolly unsettling.
About Mr Natsume
Susato:
About Mr Natsume then, Mr Garrideb! Please, do tell us!
Garrideb:
Ah yes, the Japanese chap. Only been lodging here for a week.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, just one week? So he moved in very recently, then.
Garrideb:
I have two lodgers most of the time. One on the ground floor, and one just below us. The first floor room became available a week ago, you see. There'd been- AAAAAAAAARGH!!! Dash it all, Joan! Do be careful!
Maid:
Oh! My goodness! I'm terribly sorry, sir! ......... If you want to know my opinion... ...I thought he was a shady sort from the moment I set eyes on him.
Susato:
Oh? Why?
Maid:
He seemed to have a most nervous disposition. Always shaking, and looking over his shoulder. The man had 'shady' written across his sweat-soaked brow, if you ask me. I said to myself, 'Joan, that man is trouble. Sooner or later, he's going to do something untoward.' ...And I'm rarely wrong about anything.
Ryunosuke:
(We won't be calling this maid as a witness, that's for sure.)
Susato:
Was there anything else that struck you as suspicious about the man at all?
Maid:
...! Yes! Oh, yes, indeed there was!
Ryunosuke:
(And she's dying to tell us...)
The shady lodger (appears after "About Mr Natsume")
Ryunosuke:
Had you noticed anything else at all about your lodger, Mr Natsume?
Maid:
...! Oh my word, yes! The man was shadier than an orchard!
Susato:
Could you elaborate?
Maid:
Well, take the man's room. Absolutely stuffed full of books, it is. More than anyone could ever read! And he never so much as passes the time of day with another living soul. I haven't seen a single visitor call. He just trots off to that old bookshop every single day, and comes back at five to light the gas fire. And the funny little man is up long past the time everyone else in the house has gone to bed, too.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! I, I see.
Maid:
The gentleman on the ground floor goes to bed at around nine each night. But I've never known that Japanese fellow to retire any earlier than two in the morning.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...
Susato:
......... Could you clarify something, I wonder?
Maid:
What, pray?
Susato:
How do you know so much about Mr Natsume's routine?
Maid:
Oh!
Susato:
I'd understood that neither of the lodgers live on this floor of the house. Is that correct?
Garrideb:
That's right, yes. They're both below us. On the first floor and street level.
Susato:
Then...how is it that you know so much about the lives of your lodgers? The precise times that they come back in the evening, for example. Even the times they go to bed.
Maid:
.........
Garrideb:
AAAAAAAAARGH!!! Good grief, Joan! Be more careful, woman!
Maid:
Oh my goodness, sir! I'm terribly sorry, sir!
Ryunosuke:
(Hm... Something doesn't add up here.)
Maid:
.........
The incident two days ago
Ryunosuke:
It seems that the incident took place at around five in the evening. Did you happen to look out of the window at around that time?
Garrideb:
Hm? The window?
Susato:
Yes, we noticed that the window over there looks out over Briar Road. The incident took place on the pavement just on the far side of the street. Was there anyone suspicious loitering nearby?
Garrideb:
Five o'clock is dinner time in the Garrideb household. So I'm afraid I don't remember seeing anything. How about you, Joan?
Maid:
No, sir. It would have been dusk outside already at that hour. And with the fog as well, I should think it would have been quite impossible to see the other side of the road.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see.
Susato:
Did you notice anything else out of the ordinary, then?
Garrideb:
Such as...?
Susato:
Anything at all! Even if it seems unrelated.
Garrideb:
Hmph, well...
Ryunosuke:
...! Yes? Was there something, then?
Garrideb:
Well, it's nothing particularly significant, but at around that sort of time in here, there- AAAAAAAAARGH!!! For the love of God, Joan! Watch what you're doing!
Maid:
Oh dearie me! What have I done? I'm awfully sorry, sir!
Garrideb:
Do be more careful, woman!
Maid:
Of course, sir. If I may, Mr Narrow-Hollow...
Ryunosuke:
Oh. ...Err, yes?
Maid:
I have an exceedingly good memory, and as far as I remember... ...nothing of any significance took place here at that hour. Nothing at all.
Ryunosuke:
Oh. Really? Mr Garrideb? The way you were talking before, it sounded rather like there might have been.
Garrideb:
Oh, well. As I was saying, it was just a trifling matter really. Nothing of- AAAAAAAAARGH!!! Joan! Dash it all! What is the matter with you, woman!
Maid:
Begging your pardon, sir. ...Nothing happened.
Garrideb:
......... Hm, yes. Quite. Nothing happened. We sat down to a quiet, uneventful meal, hm, Joan?
Maid:
Thaaat's right, Mr Garrideb.
Ryunosuke:
......... (What is the matter with these two?!)
Susato:
It sounds like something happened here in this room on the evening of the incident...but what?
Ryunosuke:
(I wish I knew...)
Mr Natsume's room (appears after "The shady lodger" and "The incident two days ago")
Ryunosuke:
Could you tell us which floor Mr Natsume's room is on?
Garrideb:
Why, certainly. Just below us on the first floor.
Susato:
And Mr Sholmes is investigating there, even as we speak?
Garrideb:
Yes. Told me Nats-his-name had asked him to look into the matter, so I gave him the key.
Susato:
Mr Natsume has engaged Mr Sholmes's services?
Ryunosuke:
(That's a blatant lie.) Would it be alright if we also had a look around? In Mr Natsume's room, I mean.
Garrideb:
...Hmph, don't see why not. It's just down one flight of stairs.
Ryunosuke:
(Who knows if we'll find anything that could help us with the case, but we have to try.) We need all the clues we can lay our hands on. Shall we?
Susato:
Yes. And while we're there... ...we can speak with Mr Sholmes again! Perhaps he'll be able to tell us more.
Cannon
Ryunosuke:
That's a full-sized cannon! What's it doing in here?
Susato:
Oh my... It's real! I thought it might be a replica.
Garrideb:
That old thing? Bah, that's little more than a toy.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Garrideb:
The army was selling it off when I retired, so I decided to give it a new home. Never know when the enemy might attack next! Jolly useful to have a cannon about the house.
Ryunosuke:
Really? It isn't...overkill?
Garrideb:
Be prepared, I always say. You never know what this twisted world is going to throw at you next, boy.
Susato:
Do you think there may be trouble brewing, Mr Garrideb?
Garrideb:
Always is! Take Joan here. Never fails to have a clean apron in reserve. Dries them over the barrel, you see. They dry very well on the cannon there, Joan tells me. Which rather proves my point, I feel.
Ryunosuke:
(...It's been reduced to a drying rack. No wonder the huge cannon looks like it's hanging its head in shame.)
Pile of books
Ryunosuke:
I notice you have a pile of books here, Mr Garrideb. Do you enjoy reading?
Garrideb:
Ever experience a London winter, boy? The nights are long. No better way to pass the time than in front of the fire with a jolly good book.
Susato:
Oh! There's a copy of Randst Magazine here, I see. No doubt Mr Garrideb enjoys 'The Adventure of Herlock Sholmes', too!
Ryunosuke:
...The great detective has a great many followers, it would seem.
Uniform
Ryunosuke:
That uniform looks fairly ancient, doesn't it?
Susato:
It's clearly been well looked after though.
Garrideb:
That old thing? Pah! Not much better than rags, really.
Ryunosuke:
Oh?
Garrideb:
Wore that ceremonial garb at my retirement bash, you know. But I'm not one for dwelling on the past, me. Would have gladly thrown it out, but you know how it is. Anyway, doesn't hurt to have the odd piece of memorabilia lying around, does it?
Susato:
Oh...I see.
Ryunosuke:
(Perhaps we should leave the past in the past...)
Mortar shells
Ryunosuke:
Are, are those mortar shells? They're enormous!
Susato:
Ah! I hadn't noticed! What are they doing here?
Garrideb:
Ah, those old things? Couple of little rounds I accidentally fired into the barracks during training, you know. Became a bit of colourful regiment folklore, that incident.
Ryunosuke:
You mean, you deliberately hunted out the spent shells?
Garrideb:
Well, I wouldn't say 'deliberately' exactly. They're only scrap iron, after all. Usually just thrown away, I believe. But you never know when things might come in useful, do you?
Ryunosuke:
...Useful for what, exactly?
Garrideb:
Hmmm...yes...well... Joan here did manage to knock one of the bally things on my foot the other day while she was dusting!
Susato:
Oh no!
Garrideb:
Hadn't shed a tear since 1869 before then, you know.
Ryunosuke:
(...Maybe reconsider throwing them away?)
Medal
Susato:
That looks like a medal of honour. And it's showcased on a very grand banner.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It's displayed with some pride, I would say. ...Although it bothers me that it's not straight.
Garrideb:
What, that old thing?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Garrideb:
I should be glad to see the back of it, but the general would turn in his grave if I disposed of it. The wall's the best place for it. Keeps the bally thing out of my way.
Ryunosuke:
(So it's just been polished to shine by accident, I suppose?)
Susato:
...There appears to be an inscription on the medal itself, look. Let me see... It says, 'For Distinguished Participation'.
Ryunosuke:
...Sounds like the kind of honours even I could be in line for.
Garrideb:
Well, one doesn't like to blow one's own trumpet. But I was given that for my time in the army. Can't measure an officer by the number of medals to his name, of course. Common knowledge in military circles.
Painting or lion
Ryunosuke:
...That portrait of Mr Garrideb is glaring at me, I swear.
Susato:
Have you noticed that all the little frames contain photographic prints of Mr Garrideb as well?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, and...there seems to be a statue of a lion on the mantelpiece as well.
Garrideb:
Ah, yes. Seemed to come back from the local pawnbroker with that little trinket.
Ryunosuke:
'Seemed to come back'? What do you mean?
Garrideb:
The chap who runs the place is a bally wizard! Went in to sell him something and came out with that thing! In point of fact... Now I think about it, I rather often find myself leaving the place with something I don't need.
Susato:
The lion ornament certainly does seem surplus to requirements.
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san doesn't pull her punches! ...Or her throws, for that matter.)
Screen
Susato:
Look at that enormous screen! It must have been put there deliberately, surely.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It certainly seems like someone's trying to hide something from view. (What could be behind it, I wonder...)
Susato:
I'm going to have a very quick look. Just a little peek!
Maid:
Ahem! Ahem!
Ryunosuke:
...Maybe let's not, Miss Susato. I think the maid is going to head us off with a cup of tea.
Maid:
Ahem! Ahem!
Window
Susato:
This window looks out over Briar Road, where the young woman was attacked.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes... I can make out the policemen on the far side of the road investigating the crime scene.
Susato:
The glass is rather murky, isn't it? You can't see very clearly.
Ryunosuke:
Does this thing open at all, I wonder...
Maid:
I shouldn't underestimate the bitterness of a London winter, sir.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Maid:
As soon as you open that window, the tea will freeze in the pot! No Londoner would go opening windows at dusk in the middle of winter, I assure you.
Ryunosuke:
(It seems very unlikely that these two would have seen anything of the incident, then.)
Table or cakes
Susato:
Oh, look! What a wonderful collection of cakes lined up on that gleaming silver cake stand!
Ryunosuke:
('Lined up'? It looks more like someone has half demolished them to me.)
Maid:
Afternoon tea is a time of indulgence, you know. It is quite the English way. It is Mr Garrideb's custom to take two cakes with his tea.
Susato:
That sounds delightful!
Ryunosuke:
Oh... Wait a minute, though... There are at least ten cakes on this cake stand.
Maid:
Well, naturally! And it would never do to waste the leftovers. So whatever Mr Garrideb doesn't eat, I say to myself, 'Joan, you shall have to tidy up.'
Ryunosuke:
How...magnanimous of you.
Candles
Susato:
This old candle holder looks a little out of place here, wouldn't you say?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, you're right. It's clearly supposed to be gold, but it's almost completely black for some reason.
Garrideb:
Ah, um...that old thing, yes. Just a cheap of ironmongery. Gimcrack, really.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Garrideb:
Used it when I was studying, don't you know? For my commission. I know it's old. Hardly worth hanging on to, really. But...well, still has its uses sometimes.
Susato:
Of course.
Ryunosuke:
Does everything in this room have some elaborate story behind it?
Susato:
They're memories, Mr Naruhodo... Memories.
Dresser or shelves on right
Ryunosuke:
Look at this crockery on display here. It's rather...unusual, isn't it?
Susato:
Oh my! A genuine London dresser! Isn't it delightful?! ...Although the shelves seem to be broken, and the crockery is... Oh dear! It's in pieces!
Ryunosuke:
It really is. The word 'cracked' wouldn't do that chinaware justice.
Susato:
......... Ah! I wonder... Perhaps the cannon was fired at it!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, probably something like that. (But let's not delve too deeply here...)
Sholmes's Suite
Examine
Iris Wilson
Ryunosuke:
Iris is hard at work at her desk, look. She's tapping away on her typewriter so fast, her fingers are a blur.
Iris:
Sorry, I can't stop! I have to meet the deadline for the next issue!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see. You must be very busy then.
Susato:
Don't disturb her, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
...I won't! So you can lower your arms now, please.
19th February
Mr Natsume's Room
Ryunosuke:
Wha...? Just look at this place! (And smell it! It's so musty in here. I suppose it's the mountains of old books that are responsible for that.)
Susato:
......... I don't think I've ever seen so many books in all my life!
Ryunosuke:
No, me neither. It's so dark in here, too.
Susato:
Is that the window over there?
Ryunosuke:
Well, it WAS the window, I think, yes. Once upon a time. (But for some reason it's been closed up with bricks and mortar.) So this is where Mr Natsume lives...
Susato:
By the way... ...I haven't spotted Mr Sholmes anywhere, have you?
Ryunosuke:
No, that's true. But according to what Mr Garrideb told us... ...the great detective should be around here somewhere investigating.
Examine
Desk
Susato:
That desk seems to be wedged into a crevasse between the mountains of books on either side.
Ryunosuke:
I suppose Mr Natsume would sit there and read while stroking his cat. But surrounded on all sides by these towering old tomes... Surely he dreamt of books every night as well.
Susato:
Yes...he must have done, mustn't he? ...Oh! What's this? It's a receipt from a secondhand bookshop. 'Yore Books'...
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes. Mr Natsume's name is on it, look. And the date of purchase... Ah, two days ago at 4:45 p.m. (That's the day of the incident!)
Susato:
That's just a short while before he was embroiled in the terrible attack! He must have been on his way back from buying some old books.
The secondhand book receipt has been entered into the Court Record.
Desk (subsequent times)
Susato:
That desk seems to be wedged into a crevasse between the mountains of books on either side.
Ryunosuke:
I suppose Mr Natsume would sit there and read while stroking his cat. But surrounded on all sides by these towering old tomes... Surely he dreamt of books every night as well.
Susato:
Yes...he must have done, mustn't he?
Herlock Sholmes (appears after examining desk)
Leads to:
"Aaah! Look, Mr Naruhodo!"
Cat figurine
Susato:
Oh look! It's a beckoning cat from home!
Ryunosuke:
It's a bit big and bulky, isn't it? Surely Mr Natsume didn't bring that maneki-neko all the way from Japan with him.
Susato:
I hardly think you're in a position to comment, Mr Naruhodo. Are you forgetting the enormous daruma doll that you brought in your luggage?
Ryunosuke:
...Well, it can be dangerous travelling abroad. I wanted a lucky charm.
Susato:
Well, I imagine Mr Natsume wanted the same. And this cat is sure to beckon good luck to him.
Ryunosuke:
(It's not doing a very good job so far, is it?)
Susato:
You mustn't say such things!
Ryunosuke:
I didn't say a word! (...Why are my eyes such a giveaway?)
Piles of books
Ryunosuke:
Look at all those books stacked up there! They almost reach the ceiling.
Susato:
They're all works of English literature. ...And they all smell so musty.
Ryunosuke:
With this volume of books to hand, you'd never be short of reading material, would you?
Susato:
No, what a dreamy idea!
Ryunosuke:
(...A bad dream, maybe. For me at least.) Mind you, I don't imagine the book that's at the bottom of the pile now will ever be read again.
Susato:
Ah, so reading is an experience that comes but once in a lifetime. Just as the tea ceremony teaches us.
Ryunosuke:
...I certainly didn't expect the conversation to turn down the path of tea ceremony philosophy.
Bricked up window
Ryunosuke:
Could you even call this a window?
Susato:
I think so... It was a window at one time, after all. Although all that remains is a frame around some bricks now.
Ryunosuke:
So really it's just a wall then, isn't it? But why would anyone deliberately brick it up like that?
Susato:
I'm afraid I have no idea. Ah! Perhaps Mr Natsume painted the brick design on in a fit of whimsy.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... That's alarmingly feasible. Anyway, whatever the reason, the lack of ventilation in here makes the place very oppressive.
Susato:
It does. I imagine being cooped up in a room like this would be extremely trying.
Cat
Susato:
Oh my! What an adorable little cat! Perhaps he's looking after all the books while his master is away.
Ryunosuke:
I don't know about that. He disappeared into that pile of books as quick as a flash. It was a tricolor 'mi-ke', wasn't it? Do they even have that sort of cat here in Great Britain?
Susato:
Perhaps Mr Natsume brought the little creature with him from Japan.
Ryunosuke:
...That's made me feel homesick now.
Susato:
Already? We've only been in the country for two days.
Paper wads on floor
Ryunosuke:
Look at all these balls of paper on the floor. There are notes scrawled all over them. In English. It looks like the wastepaper basket is so full, they've just fallen out.
Susato:
I think Mr Natsume must have been deeply immersed in his research, don't you?
Ryunosuke:
Or deeply averse to tidying up his mess.
Susato:
......... I...wouldn't like to speculate which is closer to the truth.
Susato:
Aaah! Look, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Ah-ha! There he is! (Where did he appear from?)
Susato:
He seems to be engrossed in the pages of an old book. I hope heh won't mind if we disturb him... Hellooo! Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
...! Ah, you two! Good day. Now, let me see... Where was it that we met?
Susato:
Oh, Mr Sholmes! We were together on the SS Burya.
Sholmes:
Yes, of course! The Burya. And let me see... What happened on that voyage?
Ryunosuke:
It was Kazuma Asogi. He died...tragically. But you were a great help to us.
Sholmes:
Ah yes, but of course! The case of Mr Asogi! It was the one with the snake, wasn't it?
Susato:
Oh!
Ryunosuke:
Well...you seem to remember...something of it, at least.
Susato:
What an honour, to be remembered vaguely by the great Herlock Sholmes! This is Mr-
Sholmes:
Oh no no, my dear madam, hold your tongue! I pride myself on my superior powers of recollection. Your names are safely recorded in my brain-attic. Miss Naruhodo... ...and Mr Susato!
Ryunosuke:
...Try the other way around, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! I lose the first round!
Sholmes:
...In truth, I had hoped to invite you both to my Baker Street suite the day we arrived in London. But some Scotland Yarders ambushed me at the railway station and whisked me away to a crime scene. It was an entirely trivial case, of course. I solved the matter in no more than thirty minutes.
Ryunosuke:
(So they apprehended Soseki-san in THAT short an amount of time?)
Sholmes:
I'm afraid the pursuance of a new case has dulled my recollection of my past involvements a little.
Ryunosuke:
'A little'?
Sholmes:
It is a mistake to think that one's brain-attic has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. I do my best to forget useless facts, lest they should elbow out the useful ones. Yes! Those are my own words of inimitable wisdom, you know. From an adventure entitled, 'A Study in Scarlet'.
Ryunosuke:
...Please, there's no need to quote yourself.
Sholmes:
I don't always remember my pearls of wisdom, but fortunately, my associate pens them beautifully.
Ryunosuke:
(He means Iris, I suppose.)
Susato:
Mr Sholmes... ...we have some extremely important questions to ask you about the 'trivial case' you just mentioned!
Sholmes:
Goodness! What an earnest expression. My dear madam, I should be only too pleased. And this murky room is an apt place to discuss the murky case!
Converse
Mr Natsume's arrest
Ryunosuke:
We know this to be the lodgings of a Japanese foreign student by the name of Soseki Natsume. It seems that you assisted in his arrest, Mr Sholmes. For the stabbing of a young woman outside here on Briar Road.
Sholmes:
Hm, Natsume... Yes, I believe it was a name rather along those lines.
Susato:
But Mr Natsume denies it! Was it really justifiable to arrest him on so little?
Sholmes:
......... I'm sorry, Miss Susato... ...but I have not the slightest idea what you mean.
Susato:
Wha...?
Ryunosuke:
(I can't believe he was looking Susato-san squarely in the eye while feigning ignorance.)
Sholmes:
I assure you, I am not merely feigning ignorance. It would appear as if the pair of you are under some misapprehension.
Ryunosuke:
Oh? How?
Sholmes:
I assure you I have no recollection of accusing your stooped compatriot of the crime.
Ryunosuke:
But that doesn't make sense!
Sholmes:
The good detective of Scotland Yard made the following request of me, and I quote verbatim: 'We need you to ascertain the identity and whereabouts of a man seen fleeing the crime scene.'
Ryunosuke:
Ah... A man...seen fleeing...
Sholmes:
There were a number of books scattered on the pavement at the scene. From the bookplates, I was quickly able to determine the bookshop from which they had been purchased. On speaking with the proprietor, I was immediately led to this address. ...Elementary, wouldn't you say? I believe there is a receipt around here somewhere from the establishment in question.
Ryunosuke:
So you don't think Mr Natsume is the culprit then!
Sholmes:
Hm...that I could not tell you. But it was aggravating my faculties. Hence why I returned here. However, this place is such a trove of fascinating books, I found myself quite lost in bibliophily. ...Do not be deceived into believing that I am a man of leisure. No no no!
Susato:
Oh dear...
Mr Garrideb, the landlord
Sholmes:
Ah...tell me... ...have you encountered the landlord of these lodgings?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Mr Garrideb. ...A retired military man.
Susato:
It was the first time I've ever met a soldier from the great British institution that is the Services.
Ryunosuke:
And it was the first time I've ever met a maid from the great British institution that is...service.
Sholmes:
......... Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
Ryunosuke:
I-I didn't think it was THAT funny...!
Sholmes:
I do apologise. As you may well be aware, many households in London employ a maid.
Susato:
Yes! I read as much in my 'Great Britain Primer'.
Sholmes:
And so conversely... ...whether or not a household employs a maid has come to betoken the social standing of those dwelling therein.
Ryunosuke:
Betoken their social standing? ...Sorry?
Sholmes:
Put simply, my dear fellow... ...those who employ at least a single maid are considered middle class. Those who do not, are beneath that. In the upper echelons of society, of course, households employ enough staff to constitute a large family. 
Susato:
Goodness! How extraordinary...
Sholmes:
As you can appreciate, for those on the precarious boundary between the middle and lower classes... ...being able to afford just one maid is of the first importance.
Ryunosuke:
I...I had no idea.
Sholmes:
And it is for precisely that reason, that I find great stimulation in the situation upstairs. Specifically, in the retired army veteran, Mr John Garrideb.
Ryunosuke:
Oh?
Sholmes:
Affable as he is, the fellow is hiding something. Whether or not it imposes on the circumstances of this case, I am as yet unable to ascertain.
Ryunosuke:
(...I'm thoroughly lost on what he means to say.)
The dingy room
Sholmes:
...This room is thoroughly suffocating for the soul, my dear fellow. I assure you, any man whose lot is to dwell in a place such as this will stab somebody sooner or later.
Susato:
Mr Natsume has stabbed no one!
Sholmes:
Ah, but 'sooner or later', as I said...
Susato:
I don't believe that's the issue here.
Ryunosuke:
...About this dark little room, Mr Sholmes... Why is there no longer a window? Do you have any idea?
Sholmes:
No window?
Ryunosuke:
Well, I mean, I can clearly see that there is a window... of sorts. But it's been completely blocked with bricks.
Sholmes:
Ah, I see. The answer to that question is quite simple: Window tax.
Ryunosuke:
Window...tax? What is that?
Susato:
Surely...not a tax on windows?
Sholmes:
Precisely that.
Susato:
Oh my goodness!
Sholmes:
Until relatively recently, a tax was levied on households in this country by the number of their windows. Those of lesser means, having inherited a sizeable and costly family home perhaps, rapidly closed windows up. While the rich opened windows here, there and everywhere... ...in an effort to curry favour with those in power by furnishing them with large sums of tax money.
Susato:
How awful! ...And unjust! Forcing people to live in rooms devoid of light!
Sholmes:
Indeed, disease was rife as a result. So some forty years ago, or thereabouts, the window tax was abolished. But its legacy remains, as you can see. In squalid lodgings such as these, for example.
Ryunosuke:
I suppose Mr Natsume's stipend for living here in London isn't very generous perhaps...
Sholmes:
It would appear so. I've done a little digging... ...and discovered that these lodgings were offered at an extraordinarily low price.
Susato:
Because the room is so awful, I should think.
Ryunosuke:
Apparently Mr Natsume only moved in here about one week ago.
Sholmes:
Yes, that's correct. However... ...I don't believe the low rent is explained by the shabby nature of the accommodation.
Ryunosuke:
Oh?
Sholmes:
Still, that is of little relevance here. A matter not worthy of further attention.
Ryunosuke:
(Are you sure? I'm curious now...)
Present
Armband
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, please! Despite aversions to the contrary, I am a professional. If I am to unleash my deductive powers on that trinket... ...I must ask for a sum of three pounds in cash.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I don't need you to make any deductions about it. I was just wondering if you might know-
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo! As a professional, I insist that if I am to offer my opinion on that trinket... ...I must ask for a sum of three pounds in cash.
Susato:
...I believe Mr Sholmes has his eye on an expensive copy of 'The Complete Works of Shakespeare'.
Sholmes:
Yes, to stand on the stage amid rapturous applause... It has long been a dream of mine, as you know.
Ryunosuke:
...I literally had no idea.
Secondhand Book Receipt
Sholmes:
Ah, the receipt for the books our stooped Japanese friend purchased. I uncovered that yesterday morning. A marvellous find, wouldn't you agree?
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes. The work of a truly great detective.
Sholmes:
What a scatterbrained individual he must be to have left it behind. ...Curiously, there was no mention of this publication on the receipt. Odd, when you consider how fascinating it is.
Ryunosuke:
You mean not everyone in London buys Randst Magazine every time they visit a shop? Yes, odd indeed...
Susato:
Oh, Mr Sholmes! How expertly you slipped that into the conversation!
Sholmes:
Ah, I'm glad you agree! Detective stories can be great works of literature, too, my dear fellow!
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
...Um, have you seen this, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Shh! I must have silence! It is of the first importance when I am in the throes of deduction that nothing irrelevant distracts me.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, sorry.
Sholmes:
......... Cloudy changing to fair, perhaps...
Ryunosuke:
(You were in the throes of deducing the weather...?)
After clearing all Converse options:
Sholmes:
Well, I believe I've told you all I can now.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
Ah yes, Mr Naruhodo... ...was it not your intention to become a practitioner of law?
Ryunosuke:
...! (You remembered that, did you?)
Sholmes:
Will you perhaps be offering your services in this very matter, I wonder? To the occupant of this room, Mr...Natsume, was it?
Ryunosuke:
......... I'm not sure.
Sholmes:
Not sure? On what grounds?
Ryunosuke:
Well, I actually defended someone in court here only yesterday.
Sholmes:
Really? Well then, I congratulate you, sir, on an ambition realised. And so promptly, too.
Ryunosuke:
The thing is... ...it's really made me question things. Am I right to believe in my clients? To trust in their innocence?
Sholmes:
......... Hm, yes. Trust...
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes... ...Mr Natsume didn't do it, did he?
Sholmes:
......... Ah ha ha ha ha hah! My dear fellow, I haven't the first idea!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! But... ...I thought that's why you were here. Didn't you come back to investigate?
Sholmes:
Ah yes, that was indeed my initial intention. But there are simply too many fascinating books here. I couldn't possibly ignore them.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...I see.
Sholmes:
Nevertheless, there are two facts that I can state quite unequivocally. The man who fled the scene of the crime two days ago was the Japanese occupant of this room. And... ...there are witnesses who swear to having seen the same man commit the crime. ...That is all I can say.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Sholmes:
Ah, and one more thing...
Susato:
Oh! What is it, Mr Sholmes! Tell us!
Sholmes:
I cannot say with any certainty whether or not it is of relevance to this case, but I am quite sure... ...that the retired army man who owns this property... is hiding something.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Garrideb is...? (Mr Sholmes said as much before actually, didn't he?)
Sholmes:
Anyway, at present, that is really all that plays on my mind in relation to this case.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo... ...as yet our investigations have uncovered nothing that could help establish Mr Natsume's innocence.
Ryunosuke:
No, you're right. (Perhaps it's time we probed a little deeper into Mr Garrideb's secret...)
Sholmes:
Just remember, I cannot be sure whether the landlord's secret will prove to be of relevance or not. But I wish you every success, of course, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
(Hm, a busy man, indeed... He's gone back to his book in the corner of the room.)
Examine
Herlock Sholmes
Ryunosuke:
Excuse me, Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
Hm, yes, so true. To be, or not to be... ...that is indeed the question...Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
......... (To be, or not to be brushed off. That is the question. And the answer is all too clear.)
Susato:
...Let's leave Mr Sholmes in peace, shall we?
19th February
Mr Garrideb's Room
Garrideb:
Ah, you pair again. Tell me, was the detective chap - I forget his name - still hard at work down there?
Susato:
Mr Herlock Sholmes?
Garrideb:
Ah yes, rings a vague bell. All that detective business isn't really my thing, I'm afraid.
Ryunosuke:
Well, Mr Sholmes is...in his element down there.
Garrideb:
Jolly good show. Another cup of tea, if you please, Joan. ...Now then, why don't you tell me what- AAAAAAAAARGH!!! For the umpteenth time, woman, will you watch what you're bally well doing?!
Maid:
I shall be serving dinner shortly, sir.
Garrideb:
Hm? Ah... Yes, of course. Frightfully rude of me, but I'm afraid I shall have to ask you to take your leave, if you'd be so kind?
Susato:
Oh, yes, of course. We are deeply grateful for all your assistance.
Garrideb:
Not at all, not at all! Don't get much chance to talk with young foreigners like yourselves. It's been a pleasure. Best of luck, and all that. ...Perhaps you could see yourselves out.
Ryunosuke:
(According to Mr Sholmes... ...Mr Garrideb is hiding something. And since no other avenues of investigation seem open to us at the moment, perhaps we should do some digging.)
Examine
Herlock Sholmes
Leads to:
"Ah..."
Ryunosuke:
Ah... (What's he doing over there?)
Susato:
M...Mr Sholmes?!
Sholmes:
Ah-ha! We meet again, my dear fellows!
Garrideb:
Good gracious! When did you sneak in here?
Sholmes:
Herlock Sholmes, sir, at your service.
Maid:
Whatever were you doing over by the window?
Sholmes:
I am given to watching the evening sky as the sun sets, madam. Yet sadly, cheerful as the room downstairs undoubtedly is, it lacks an aperture for such observation. So I took the liberty of borrowing a small corner of space by the window up here.
Garrideb:
Hmph. Well...
Ryunosuke:
(Keeping an eye to one's windows at dusk is the prudent thing to do in London, I'm gathering...)
Sholmes:
Ah, and one other thing, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Me?
Sholmes:
I thought perhaps you might be in need... ...of a certain great detective's...great mind!
Ryunosuke:
...! (Wait, he's not talking about...? Is he? I, I didn't expect to be going through that again so soon...)
Susato:
Do you mean, Mr Sholmes...?
Sholmes:
There is a mighty secret in this modest room. My eyes see even the most trivial of trifles. I take it you're prepared, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
I, I think so!
Sholmes:
There is just time enough for one of my greatly admired great deductions. Let us conclude the matter before dark! Mr Garrideb... ...though it would seem you are a military man of considerably distinguished service... ...your standing as a landlord is most certainly not what one might call, 'first-rate'.
Garrideb:
Hm?
Sholmes:
I'm afraid, sir, that it is all too clear to me. There are two conclusions I have been able to draw by careful observation of your living arrangements.
Garrideb:
I beg your pardon?
Sholmes:
The first... ...is that even as we speak, you are concealing the presence of a ferocious beast in your care!
Garrideb:
Eh?
Sholmes:
And the second... ...is that as a result of the beast's violent rampage, you have lost something very dear to you!
Garrideb:
Ah! Er...
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, look!
Ryunosuke:
(The old man's broken out in a cold sweat... Unbelievably, it seems Mr Sholmes's conclusions...are both spot on!)
Garrideb:
...How? How could you possibly...?
Sholmes:
'How could I possibly know?' you mean to enquire? The answer couldn't be simpler, sir. For in the dense jungle of logic and reasoning...I am the king of beasts!
Garrideb:
Agh!
Sholmes:
And I know only too well, that wild beasts are not easily tamed. So...shall we begin? Once again, Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!
The Great DeductionThe game is afoot!
Topic 1
Nature of the Beast
Sholmes:
It certainly shouldn't take a great detective to see... ...that a fearsome beast has been on the rampage of late within these four walls. Thus we are faced with the question: What form might this beast take? Ah, for a man with a military breeding, your eyes are uncommonly candid.
Garrideb:
I...!
Sholmes:
Your furtive glance, Mr Garrideb, leads us directly to the answer. The true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that lion statue! Yes, though an army man, you appear unimposing at best. A fact that has fuelled your admiration for the mighty lion, the king of beasts.
Garrideb:
What is this piffle, I ask you?!
Sholmes:
In the end, your admiration became so great, in fact... ...that you had a living, breathing specimen shipped from India, which you tried to keep in this very house!
Garrideb:
WHAAAT?!
Sholmes:
Yet living with such a wild beast proved more difficult than you had imagined. The chilling traces of a wild rampage are still very much in evidence.
Maid:
Well!
Sholmes:
Yet as we look around, the beast in question fails to present itself. Where could this angry creature have disappeared to... madam?
Maid:
M-Me?!
Sholmes:
I pray you do not consider me unchivalrous, but it is plain to me with one glance in your direction.
Maid:
It...it is?
Sholmes:
Your dress pocket gives us a handsome clue as to the beast's current whereabouts! For protruding from it is a handbill advertising a circus show.
Maid:
Ah!
Sholmes:
Yes, you sought to dispose of this terrifying lion, Mr Garrideb. At 'Batty's Circus'... ...a travelling show currently sojourning in a nearby park. I have observed the tents. You sold the savage lion, sir, to the circus troupe!
Garrideb:
I, I most certainly did not!
Sholmes:
...I believe I have made my point. The fearsome beast which ran amok in this room...was an Indian lion! And a simple visit to the circus now will reveal the lion prancing jubilantly through a ring of fire!
Topic 1
Nature of the Beast
Conclusion
A rampaging Asiatic lion
Topic 2
Aftermath
Sholmes:
Now...Mr Garrideb... ...it is plainly clear that you still have deep feelings for this formidable 'beast'. Indeed, in that blithe pose, the distress this loss has caused you is veritably tangible.
Garrideb:
...!
Sholmes:
Your head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that supporting arm. Amid fits of tears, you let your beloved beast go. The strain of losing something so dear to you is clearly visible in your visage.
Garrideb:
Nonsense man! I, I simply...
Sholmes:
But what, we must now ask ourselves, is the true cause of this pain? And we need only follow the direction of your gaze to find the answer. Yes, it is this pile of bills that has given rise to the pain you suffer. Every envelope contains another demand for payment.
Maid:
Ah...
Sholmes:
For cart-loads of meat, potatoes, wheat and tea. Indeed, feeding your beloved has had a devastating impact on the financial circumstances of your household. And so you had no choice but to let it go.
Garrideb:
Yes, well, erm...
Sholmes:
Now...in a final fit of rage, the ferocious beast carried out one last, unimaginable attack...
Maid:
Un-Unimaginable...?
Sholmes:
...The aftermath of which can be clearly seen by observing the carpet over there! A very expensive woollen carpet, if I am not mistaken.
Maid:
Oh dearie me...
Sholmes:
What could have caused such a destructive outburst?
Maid:
Ah...
Sholmes:
...This time, madam, I'm afraid it is you who has inadvertently revealed the truth to me. Your wandering eye has settled upon the answer very neatly indeed. Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the tower of cakes!
Maid:
Ah!
Sholmes:
There is no creature more dangerous on this earth than a beast with an unsatiated appetite. Was it or was it not once said by a noblewoman, 'If they have no bread, let them eat cake'? Food is at the heart of all tragedy, in fact.
Maid:
Whatever do you mean?
Sholmes:
Having tired of the taste of cake, the beast began to stalk its next prey. I'm sure I need not spell out the nature of this final act of destruction carried out by the beast. There is only one logical conclusion: Worked into a frenzy by hunger, the lion attacked and ate the carpet! The teeth marks in the carpet...are a perfect match with those of a lion I once saw in India.
Topic 2
Aftermath
Conclusion
Carpet gnawed on by the starving lion
Sholmes:
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this beastly puzzle!
Garrideb:
AAAAAAAAARGH!!! What is the matter with you, Joan?! You're pouring scalding hot tea all over me!
Maid:
Oh...I'm sorry, Mr Garrideb. I'm afraid I didn't notice.
Sholmes:
My deductions can be startlingly sharp. It stands to reason that your cup runneth over. Indeed, my revelations can make people spill tears at times, too.
Maid:
Oh...
Ryunosuke:
Erm, Mr Sholmes, sorry to butt in...again. But could I make an observation?
Sholmes:
Why certainly, Mr Naruhodo. What is it...again?
Ryunosuke:
Well, your deductions just now... Do you really think a lion could have fit inside a room of this size?
Sholmes:
Indeed. It is the only explanation for the facts. The terrifying truth all too often lies beyond the realms of common sense!
Ryunosuke:
(But wouldn't it be an idea to consider what lies inside the realms of common sense as well?)
Susato:
But...if an uncaged lion had run amok in this very room... ...surely Mr Garrideb and his maid would have been hurt...or worse.
Sholmes:
Ah, that's where you are stuck. No doubt the former military man held his own against the beast using that large cannon.
Ryunosuke:
I thought you said that they sold the lion to the circus...
Susato:
And what about the food? Meat and potatoes are one thing... ...but I don't believe I have ever heard of a lion that drinks tea.
Sholmes:
Ah, my dear Miss Susato. It occurs to me with some regularity... ...that irrespective of race and breeding, whenever anyone lands on Great British soil... ...they are infused with a highly appropriate taste for afternoon tea!
Susato:
Oh! ...What a glorious notion! Well then, Mr Naruhodo! It's your turn to shine again!
Ryunosuke:
I...had a feeling that was coming.
Susato:
A slight massage, that's all Mr Sholmes's deductions need. You can do it!
Sholmes:
Excellent. I've been waiting for my trusty partner in deduction to step forward, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
(...We don't even know yet whether or not this is going to help with Mr Natsume's case. Still... ...uncovering the truth is always worthwhile, whatever the motivation! ...At least, that's what I want to believe...)
Sholmes:
Let us start again from the beginning... ...of Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!
Course CorrectionHold it, Mr Sholmes!
Topic 1
Nature of the Beast
Conclusion
A rampaging Asiatic lion
Sholmes:
It certainly shouldn't take a great detective to see... ...that a fearsome beast has been on the rampage of late within these four walls. Thus we are faced with the question: What form might this beast take? Ah, for a man with a military breeding, your eyes are uncommonly candid.
Garrideb:
I...!
Sholmes:
Your furtive glance, Mr Garrideb, leads us directly to the answer. The true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that lion statue!
Ryunosuke:
...I really didn't see the lion thing coming.
Susato:
No, but if you observe Mr Garrideb's reaction... ...it rather seems as though some beast did indeed run amok here in this room.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, something with a very fierce nature.
Susato:
But it couldn't have been a lion transported from India.
Ryunosuke:
So what was it, then?
Susato:
We must follow Mr Garrideb's gaze. That will lead us to the true answer!
Examine lion statue
Ryunosuke:
Well, this is the lion statue that Mr Sholmes picked out.
Susato:
Yes... I wonder... ...perhaps if you did live with a lion, it would prove to be a rather sweet companion.
Ryunosuke:
I think... ...that's like a mouse trying to tell its family that the cat around the house is sweet.
Susato:
I supposed it IS a bit of a flight of fancy, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Anyway, the beast we're looking for is something else. Let's have a good look around!
Examine mortar shells
Ryunosuke:
Th-These are shells for the cannon, are they? What a strange place to keep them.
Susato:
I imagine they have some significance to Mr Garrideb. From his time in the army. ...Ah, of course! He mentioned a battle to us before, didn't he? Do you remember? He said that he'd been shot in the knee. Perhaps it was one of these that hit him?
Ryunosuke:
...If a round that size had hit his knee, there'd be nothing left of it...or Mr Garrideb for that matter. (Mr Sholmes has a Persian slipper... ...and this man has spent shells. Perhaps it's customary in Britain to display...well, rubbish, on the mantelpiece...)
Examine photograph frame
Ryunosuke:
What's this photograph?
Susato:
It appears to be from Mr Garrideb's wedding. He looks very happy, doesn't he?
Ryunosuke:
He does, but...you can't make out his bride.
Susato:
No, how unfortunate. Something must have struck the glass directly over the woman's face.
Ryunosuke:
(I wonder what happened... Probably best not to delve too deeply there.)
Examine newlywed bride
Susato:
The glass is broken, so you can't see the bride's face at all.
Ryunosuke:
But no amount of cracks could hide the woman's plump form.
Susato:
I think 'powerful' would be kinder than 'plump', Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, she certainly looks that. There's a lot of horsepower here. Not someone you'd want to upset, that's for sure.
Susato:
Oh look! Have you noticed her wedding ring? It's very large, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's an unusual design.
Susato:
It looks like some sort of embellished sunflower.
Examine Mr Garrideb
Susato:
This must have been when Mr Garrideb was still in the army.
Ryunosuke:
He seems to be carrying his rather stout bride effortlessly, and beaming a smile at the same time.
Susato:
I suppose he was very strong in his younger years.
Ryunosuke:
Hard to imagine now. He's as thin as a rake.
Examine photograph frame, then present newlywed bride
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that newlywed bride!"
Present lion statue
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
There is no beast more ferocious than the lion. And no lion that wouldn't unleash its ferocity in unfamiliar surroundings such as this. So it must have been a lion! No other proof is necessary!
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.
Ryunosuke:
An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.
Leads to:
"The true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that lion statue!"
Present mortar shells
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The true identity of the 'beast' that tore this room apart is these shells... ...with their butter-wouldn't-melt accomplice, the cannon! But war is good for nothing. It brings only destruction. ...Something we must all strive to understand!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"The true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that lion statue!"
Present photograph frame
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Behind the lion statute on the mantelpiece, almost deliberately hidden from view, is a photograph. Though I have yet to examine it in detail, I can assure you that it holds the answer. Because I'm employing an extremely advanced detection technique called 'jumping to conclusions', you see!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"The true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that lion statue!"
Examine photograph frame, then present Mr Garrideb
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
As we can see from this photographic print, some ten years ago, you were a fighting fit soldier, Mr Garrideb. No doubt a man of such strength could devastate a room like this in a fit of rage! But that was ten years ago, sir. Do you not think it's time you tidied the place up?
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"The true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that lion statue!"
The true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that lion statue!
Susato:
Well, what we do know with some certainty, is that a destructive creature has been at work in this room.
Ryunosuke:
And that Mr Garrideb inadvertently looked in the direction of something that gives its identity away. (Yes, if we investigate thoroughly enough, we ought to find the answer.)
Susato:
What did Mr Garrideb turn to look at? It's here somewhere. We simply need to find it!
Ryunosuke:
The true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that newlywed bride!
Sholmes:
Precisely, Mr Naruhodo! No other explanation could possibly fit! Yes, this framed print pictures your wife, Mr Garrideb. And while we lament the fact that her face is obscured...
Ryunosuke:
...we can still make out her mighty arms, and note the considerable horsepower they must contain.
Garrideb:
Oh, um...
Sholmes:
Indeed! Surely any woman of such powerful constitution would be honoured to be described as a 'beast'!
Ryunosuke:
Um...'honoured' might be stretching a point...
Sholmes:
Too late! The fact remains that the beast, which so clearly savaged this room... ...was your wife, Mr Garrideb!
Garrideb:
GYAAARGH!
Sholmes:
The chilling traces of a wild rampage are still very much in evidence.
Maid:
Well!
Sholmes:
Yet as we look around, the beast in question fails to present itself. Where could this angry creature have disappeared to... madam?
Maid:
M-Me?!
Sholmes:
I pray you do not consider me unchivalrous, but it is plain to me with one glance in your direction.
Maid:
It...it is?
Sholmes:
Your dress pocket gives us a handsome clue as to the beast's current whereabouts!
Susato:
The poor, fragile, defenceless woman is beside herself!
Ryunosuke:
Well... ...I don't know about 'fragile'.
Susato:
Oh...dear... Anyway, Mr Sholmes is quite right. There's no sign of a Mrs Garrideb anywhere.
Ryunosuke:
But it seems there may be a clue as to her whereabouts. A clue that this maid is trying to hide! (I wonder where Mr Garrideb's wife could be...)
Examine maid
Ryunosuke:
Two tightly shut eyes to avoid even the chance of a giveaway glance. Pursed lips to prevent any secrets from slipping out. Rounded cheeks to deflect any abuse that might be hurled her way. ...Yes, this is an unnervingly powerful woman, Miss Susato.
Susato:
...It's your turn of phrase that's unnerving, Mr Naruhodo.
Examine teapot
Susato:
What a charming little teapot. And it's in pristine condition. Joan has been pouring some deliciously fragrant tea from it for Mr Garrideb, hasn't she?
Ryunosuke:
Well, not so much 'for Mr Garrideb'... ...as 'on Mr Garrideb'. Wouldn't you say?
Susato:
I wouldn't dream of drawing attention to it!
Examine pocket
Susato:
That certainly does appear to be a circus handbill poking out from her pocket. 'Batty's Circus'...currently performing shows in a park not far from here.
Ryunosuke:
You don't think...? Surely Mr Garrideb didn't sell his wife to the circus!
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! How could you even think such a thing?
Ryunosuke:
I, I was only joking.
Susato:
Besides... ...I would have gone with 'Do you think he fed her to his pet lion?'
Ryunosuke:
...That's somehow worse.
Examine wedding ring
Ryunosuke:
She's wearing a very large ring, look.
Susato:
Oh yes. A sunflower design, with some rather nice embellishments. And it's on the ring finger of her left hand, which means... ...it's surely a wedding ring!
Ryunosuke:
It looks like it's on there for life, too. I can't imagine it would slide off a finger of that size.
Susato:
...That's something to think, Mr Naruhodo, not to say. ...Do you know, Mr Garrideb's wife in the photograph had a ring very much like this one. It was a large sunflower design as well.
Ryunosuke:
Really? You have a great memory for these things. Hm, a large sunflower wedding ring... (It's quite a coincidence that they have the same ring, isn't it?)
Present wedding ring
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Your wedding ring gives us a handsome clue as to the beast's current whereabouts!"
Present pocket
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The circus flyer poking out from your pocket... ...is compelling evidence that you have a connection to the beast we seek. Evidence that cannot be ignored, even if I want to!
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.
Ryunosuke:
An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.
Leads to:
"Your dress pocket gives us a handsome clue as to the beast's current whereabouts!"
Present maid
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
...I'm not even sure if I should voice this. It's impossible to believe it could be true, yet for some reason, the thought came into my mind... ...that this serving maid is in fact...a mighty goddess of destruction!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Your dress pocket gives us a handsome clue as to the beast's current whereabouts!"
Present teapot
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Years ago, I read about a pot like this in a book. It was an old Arabian tale. Inside the pot... ...was a genie, who, once unleashed, wielded the power to destroy the whole world!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Your dress pocket gives us a handsome clue as to the beast's current whereabouts!"
Your dress pocket gives us a handsome clue as to the beast's current whereabouts!
Susato:
We've already established who it was that caused all the damage in this room.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, Mr Garrideb's wife.
Susato:
It's just a question of finding out where she is now.
Ryunosuke:
For some reason, I feel as though she's very nearby. (I just need to find the evidence to prove it...)
Ryunosuke:
Your wedding ring gives us a handsome clue as to the beast's current whereabouts!
Maid:
Ah!
Sholmes:
Indeed it does! That flowery band gleaming on your finger gives you away! For it is identical to the one shown on the hand of Mr Garrideb's bride in this photographic print!
Ryunosuke:
In other words, you are no ordinary household maid.
Maid:
...!
Sholmes:
No... You are Mr Garrideb's lucky bride. You...are Mrs Garrideb herself!
Maid:
Oh my... WOOOOORRRRDDDD!!!
Garrideb:
...Well. Jolly fine detecting, sir. As you rightly surmised, this is the wife, yes. My Joan. Rather let herself go, you might say, but she was a bally corker back- AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
Sholmes:
...It would appear that you don't live in the most comfortable of circumstances. After all, you are a retired army man, yet you are in the business of renting out rooms.
Garrideb:
Tsk...
Sholmes:
I would assume, therefore, that you have insufficient means to employ a maid. ...Would that be correct?
Garrideb:
It's not right, I tell you! I was second lieutenant of the third regiment! A man has his pride, don't you know! By golly, it's a sorry thing when a chap can't even afford to have a single maid in his employ!
Sholmes:
Yes, here in London, one is rather judged. A household cannot be considered worthy of society if it employs no staff at all. Though in my considered opinion, such concerns about appearances are a folly.
Ryunosuke:
You, you mean Mr Garrideb has his wife...work as his maid?
Sholmes:
Precisely. ...Am I right, Mr Garrideb?
Garrideb:
Only in company, obviously. But listen here! This must remain a secret! Tip-Top secret! Please!

Nature of the Beast
Conclusion
A rampaging Asiatic lion
The raging wife of Mr Garrideb
Solved
Topic 2
Aftermath
Conclusion
Carpet gnawed on by the starving lion
Sholmes:
Now...Mr Garrideb... ...it is plainly clear that you still have deep feelings for this formidable 'beast'. Indeed, in that blithe pose, the distress this loss has caused you is veritably tangible.
Garrideb:
...!
Sholmes:
Your head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that supporting arm.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes is quite something. He's still calling Mr Garrideb's wife a 'beast'.
Susato:
Yes, as a woman, that feels rather uncomfortable.
Ryunosuke:
But Mrs Garrideb is standing beside her husband as we speak. In other words...he hasn't lost his beloved at all, has he?
Susato:
Oh, how true! So perhaps that supporting arm that seems to be propping up his head... ...has some other significance, then!
Ryunosuke:
According to Mr Sholmes, Mr Garrideb's pain is tangible, though. (What could that pose of his really signify...?)
Examine supporting arm
Susato:
Mr Garrideb certainly looks glum.
Ryunosuke:
According to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...that's because he's having to endure the acute pain of losing something dear to him. But we know that he hasn't lost his wife.
Susato:
So that means... ...there must be another cause for the pain he's suffering.
Examine slapped cheek
Ryunosuke:
Oh my! Look at that bright red mark!
Susato:
Gosh, that's quite something! And clearly made by somebody's hand.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, Mr Garrideb has been slapped on the face, it seems. Hard!
Susato:
I've never seen such a clearly defined mark. Whoever could have done such a thing?
Ryunosuke:
Well...there's a very limited number of candidates, I'd say.
Examine pipe
Susato:
That's a very large pipe, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, anyone who has something that size hanging out of his or her mouth on a regular basis... ...is sure to have a serious chin like Mr Garrideb's. (But what's that white binding around it all about?)
Present slapped cheek
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Your head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that slapped cheek!"
Present supporting arm
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Sometimes it's hard to read people's expressions. A man may have his head in his hands for many reasons. Perhaps because he's in great pain, certainly. Or perhaps because he's lost in a wonderful memory of the past. I believe, Mr Garrideb, that you're in the throes of being lost in wonderful memories of great pain!
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.
Ryunosuke:
An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.
Leads to:
"Your head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that supporting arm."
Present pipe
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
It seems to me...that your large pipe, Mr Garrideb, must be very heavy. Having that thing hanging out of your mouth all day would cause anyone's jaw to ache. You must give up smoking! It's the first step towards a pain-free life!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Your head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that supporting arm."
Your head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that supporting arm.
Ryunosuke:
What is the cause of this acute pain that Mr Garrideb obviously feels?
Susato:
It's rather strange, you know. He always seems to look at us only out of the corner of his eye.
Ryunosuke:
Maybe something is stopping him turning his head? (Perhaps we need to consider what this pain is from another angle...)
Ryunosuke:
Your head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that slapped cheek!
Sholmes:
And of course, the deliverer of that impressive mark on your cheek that refuses to fade... ...was you, Madam Joan Garrideb!
Maid:
Well, yes...
Sholmes:
You have been desperate to hide the slap mark on your cheek, sir.
Garrideb:
Agh! How the blazes...? How did you work that out, man?
Sholmes:
Nothing escapes the notice of one trained in the art of observation, my dear fellow.
Ryunosuke:
That's why you haven't looked directly at us even once... To keep your other side from view!
Garrideb:
Well, um... Hmph.
Sholmes:
Now then, let us proceed to the next conundrum. Why were you subjected to such a violent slap? In other words, we must ask ourselves what caused Madam Garrideb to fly into a rage? And we need only follow the direction of your gaze to find the answer. Yes, it is this pile of bills that has given rise to the pain you suffer.
Susato:
Didn't Mr Sholmes say that the bills were all for lion fodder?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, but now we've established that the lion never existed. Which can only mean that the thing responsible for gobbling up all that food... ...was Mr Garrideb's wife.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! She's a person, not a 'thing'!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, well... She's also a person who gave her husband a mighty slap round the face. One so hard that it left a perfect hand mark, in fact.
Susato:
Yes, why would a woman want to hit her husband with such force, I wonder?
Ryunosuke:
...I'd love to know the answer to that question.
Examine pile of bills
Susato:
Looking at all these bills, it certainly amounts to a great deal of food.
Ryunosuke:
Meat and potatoes by the cart-load, wasn't it? Well, looking at the two of them... ...you can tell immediately who eats the lion's share in this household.
Susato:
...Well at least we're no longer talking about an actual lion any more.
Examine bookmark
Susato:
Ah, someone must be reading this book at the moment. There's a bookmark here, look. Mr Garrideb is clearly an avid reader.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...wait a minute... I...don't think this is a bookmark.
Susato:
Oh no, so it isn't! It's a note, written in a woman's hand. 'Oh James, I love you. Yours, Mary'
Ryunosuke:
And look next to the signature here...
Susato:
Lip marks! Made with lipstick! Oh, what a passionate and romantic gesture!
Ryunosuke:
(Don't get any ideas, Susato-san...)
Susato:
Oh dear...I'm sorry.
Ryunosuke:
(So this bookmark is actually a love note, then. Hm...)
Changes "bookmark" to "love note"
Examine love note
Ryunosuke:
So this card that looks like it's being used as a bookmark is actually a love note.
Susato:
Yes, reading, 'Oh James, I love you. Yours, Mary'.
Ryunosuke:
But Mrs Garrideb's first name is Joan, isn't it?
Susato:
Yes... I believe we may be heading into dangerous territory here. It's very conspicuous after all, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
You mean the bright-red lips next to the woman's signature?
Susato:
Yes, it's the first thing you notice, of course. And it rather makes your heart skip a beat.
Examine broken plate
Susato:
Oh dear, this plate has been smashed to pieces. And nobody seems inclined to tidy up the mess.
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps it's some sort of high art.
Susato:
Really, Mr Naruhodo...?
Ryunosuke:
Well! Anyone who has a cannon on display in their living room is clearly a little...eccentric.
Susato:
...Yes, let's call it eccentricity.
Examine stack of books
Ryunosuke:
There are a lot of books stacked up on the shelf here, look. All novels that I've never heard of.
Susato:
It would appear somebody has purchased them all from a secondhand bookshop. I think Mr Garrideb is something of a book lover.
Examine bookmark, then present love note
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Yes, it is this love note that has given rise to the pain you suffer."
Present pile of bills
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
What causes the most pain to any man? The answer, of course, is a pile of bills and an empty purse. In fact, just imagining it brings tears to my eyes and makes this one finger look like two!
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.
Ryunosuke:
An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.
Leads to:
"Yes, it is this pile of bills that has given rise to the pain you suffer."
Present bookmark
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
What causes the most pain to any man? The answer, of course, is dropping your bookmark and losing your place in the book you're reading. Or worse, dropping someone else's bookmark, and getting a slap for it!

Leads to:
"Yes, it is this pile of bills that has given rise to the pain you suffer."
Present broken plate
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
What causes the most pain to any man? The answer, of course, is breaking one of your favorite plates. 'What am I going to eat my dinner off now?' you cry! ...But no one hears your sorrow.

Leads to:
"Yes, it is this pile of bills that has given rise to the pain you suffer."
Present stack of books
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
What causes the most pain to any man? The answer, of course, is purchasing an interesting-looking book, only to find it is written in Russian. For that reason, we should all learn Russian! ...Think of all the sorrow you could avoid.
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Yes, it is this pile of bills that has given rise to the pain you suffer."
Yes, it is this pile of bills that has given rise to the pain you suffer.
Susato:
We already know what the cause of Mr Garrideb's pain is, of course, don't we?
Ryunosuke:
The slap across the cheek which left that bright-red mark.
Susato:
Mr Garrideb and his wife seem to share a very deep and loving bond.
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps. But it's said that the stronger people's feelings are, the more fiercely they react to betrayal.
Susato:
You seem to know a lot about the ways of the heart, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
...I read it in a popular novel that I borrowed from Kazuma. (So we're looking for a reason why Mrs Garrideb would have felt betrayed by her husband, then!)
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it is this love note that has given rise to the pain you suffer.
Sholmes:
'Oh James, I love you. Yours, Mary'. ...Passionate indeed. Perhaps the sender of this note, a certain Miss Mary, is the fly in the ointment here?
Garrideb:
GAAARGH! But! I don't know the bally woman!
Ryunosuke:
You don't know her?
Garrideb:
That note wasn't written to me! It was just in the book. I don't know how it got there!
Sholmes:
It was 'just' in there, you say?
Garrideb:
That's right! That's what I've been say- AAAAAAAAARGH!!!
Maid:
A likely story!
Garrideb:
Now listen here, Joan, old thing! I explained at the time! I bought the book at that secondhand place. And that note must already have been in there.
Ryunosuke:
So...the previous owner of the book was using the note as a bookmark, you mean?
Garrideb:
That's right! That's what I've been say- AAAAAAAAARGH!!!
Maid:
A likely story!
Garrideb:
For heaven's sake, woman! Look at the name! It's written to 'James'! My name, in case you'd forgotten, is John! AAAAAAAAARGH!!!
Maid:
A likely story!
Garrideb:
Are, are you questioning my name now?!
Sholmes:
And there we have it... Arouse the suspicions of the female heart, and you unleash a beast with a most ferocious bite.
Garrideb:
Ugh...
Sholmes:
Now...in a final fit of rage, the ferocious beast carried out one last, unimaginable attack...
Maid:
Un-Unimaginable...?
Sholmes:
...The aftermath of which can be clearly seen by observing the carpet over there! A very expensive woollen carpet, if I am not mistaken.
Maid:
Oh dearie me...
Sholmes:
What could have caused such a destructive outburst?
Maid:
Ah...
Sholmes:
...This time, madam, I'm afraid it is you who has inadvertently revealed the truth to me. Your wandering eye has settled upon the answer very neatly indeed. Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the tower of cakes!
Susato:
But...but surely Mrs Garrideb didn't...eat the carpet?
Ryunosuke:
No, of course not. But there doesn't seem to be any doubt... ...that the state of disarray that this room is in is a result of her wild temper.
Susato:
...No, that's true. So, this is the last part of Mr Sholmes's deduction that we need to fix. We need only to follow Mrs Garrideb's gaze, and that will tell us the real answer.
Ryunosuke:
Alright. Let's see what we can see!
Susato:
Yes!
Examine tower of cakes
Susato:
Aah... So many cakes...
Ryunosuke:
Haah... Is that all you can think about?
Susato:
Well look at them, Mr Naruhodo! There is a mountain of them, and they all look so delicious!
Ryunosuke:
It's more of a tower than a mountain, I'd say.
Susato:
It's a mountain. And it's my hope that one day, in our very homeland... ...I will be able to perform the tea ceremony at the foot of such a mountain!
Ryunosuke:
...It's definitely a tower.
Examine candlestick
Susato:
This looks like a very old candlestick, doesn't it?
Ryunosuke:
The base looks too small. Surely it's very unstable. It looks to me like even the slightest knock would make it topple over.
Susato:
Oh dear, that would be dangerous.
Ryunosuke:
...Wait, take a closer look at this! There's one candle missing!
Susato:
Yes, I didn't notice that before.
Ryunosuke:
(Why is that, I wonder? Why is one candle of the three missing from its holder?)
Examine circus handbill
Susato:
This is an advertising handbill for the circus. 'Batty's Circus'... It's in a nearby park.
Ryunosuke:
Isn't this the same as the one we saw earlier? The one that was folded up in Mrs Garrideb's pocket?
Susato:
Perhaps they're very great circus-lovers?
Ryunosuke:
......... It...it couldn't be that the hungry lion is somehow involved again here, could it?
Susato:
Oh dear. I do hope not.
Examine carpet
Ryunosuke:
The carpet here has been ripped to shreds.
Susato:
Yes, and according to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...the tears match those made by an Indian lion's teeth exactly!
Ryunosuke:
...Oh, look here!
Susato:
What is it?
Ryunosuke:
If you look closely at the edge, you can see scorch marks.
Susato:
Oh yes, so you can! In that case... ...perhaps the carpet wasn't 'eaten' in the normal senses at all.
Ryunosuke:
(Let's rethink this with that in mind...)
Present candlestick
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the candlestick!"
Present tower of cakes
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
As you can see, the cakes on this cake stand have been strewn far and wide. In fact, I have a strong suspicion, that some of the delicious cream was thrown onto the carpet. But to a woman with a very sweet tooth, such waste would be unforgivable. So she ate it up, carpet and all!
Sholmes:
Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.
Ryunosuke:
An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.
Leads to:
"Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the tower of cakes!"
Present circus handbill
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Now, this circus handbill was discounted as part of an earlier deduction already. I realise that. And I also realise that just because it was the wrong answer then doesn't make it the right answer now. But when in doubt, my approach is present, present and present again!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the tower of cakes!"
Present carpet
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The cause of the carpet being in such a terrible state here...is the carpet itself. Now, I realise that appears to be something of a circular argument, however... ...it's the tack I've decided to try, and I'm not changing course now!
Incorrect evidence dialogue
Leads to:
"Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the tower of cakes!"
Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the tower of cakes!
Ryunosuke:
The real question here is... ...was the carpet actually eaten by something, or did something else happen to it?
Susato:
Perhaps that would be answered by examining the carpet in more detail. If we can find another possible explanation, maybe it will lead us to the right answer.
Ryunosuke:
Good idea! (Yes, the point is, how did the carpet end up like that?)
Ryunosuke:
Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the candlestick!
Sholmes:
Most illuminating, my dear fellow! And of course, the only possible way out of this logical labyrinth.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the remnants of a ferocious attack in which the carpet was devoured are clearly visible.
Sholmes:
Indeed they are. The scorch marks at the edge clearly give the truth away.
Garrideb:
Scorch marks?
Sholmes:
It would appear that this room was the scene of a little marital altercation.
Maid:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Mrs Garrideb's mighty arm muscles left an impression not only on her husband's face...
Sholmes:
...but on the entire room. The force of her strike caused a candle to fall from the holder...
Ryunosuke:
...and in seconds the carpet was alight, and the whole corner of the room in flames!
Garrideb:
Yes, erm... Hm...
Sholmes:
For the most ferocious beast in this world is neither a violent lion nor a vengeful woman...but fire.
Ryunosuke:
And in this room, that ferocious beast bared its claws and ran amok.
Sholmes:
Eloquently put, my dear fellow. So you see, there is but one conclusion here:
After the sparks of marital discord flew, this room was the scene of a fire!
Garrideb:
Mr Sholmes, sir... I salute yooooooooou!

Solved
Deduction CompleteElementary!
Garrideb:
It's these dashed long winter nights, you know. Nothing to do but read in front of the fire. Luckily, there's a jolly good secondhand bookshop just around the corner. Buy all my old novels there.
Sholmes:
And in the pages of one particular novel, you discovered some rather illicit material?
Susato:
For which your wife admonished you harshly, it seems.
Garrideb:
I don't know about 'admonished'. 'Demolished' might be rather closer to the mark. And 'beast' is most certainly an apt des- AAAAAAAAARGH!!!
Ryunosuke:
(Here we go again...) And the carpet? Was that destroyed by fire when a candle fell on the floor?
Garrideb:
'Fraid to say it was. Happened in the blink of an eye, you know. The whole place filled with smoke. Couldn't see a bally thing. I was caught between the old stick's rage and the raging flames.
Sholmes:
You paint a torrid picture, sir. ...One that would have been most entertaining.
Ryunosuke:
(That's sympathy for you...)
Garrideb:
Didn't take long for the fire to spread, of course. The bally furniture started going up as well! We've had to hide the mess behind that screen for the time being.
Susato:
Over here, Mr Garrideb?
Sholmes:
Well, you have nothing more to hide now. If you'll allow me...
Garrideb:
Had all my favourite old novels in that case. But as soon as the fire got hold of them, that was it. Whoosh! Up in smoke!
Ryunosuke:
Gosh...
Garrideb:
Then the wife started hurling things at me.
Susato:
What a terrible sight it must have been.
Garrideb:
There was I, back up against the window, under heavy enemy fire! Incendiary books incoming ten to the dozen. Worst of it is, I lost my favourite. Book called 'The Lion's Pride'.
Sholmes:
'The Lion's Pride'? Ah yes, your notorious love of big cats coming through again.
Garrideb:
I assure you, the title didn't influence my choice in the slightest.
Ryunosuke:
(So the poor man really did lose something dear to him as a result of the ferocious 'beast's' rampage.)
Susato:
Mr Sholmes's deductions turned out to be correct once again!
Ryunosuke:
...It can only be described as a great British wonder.
Garrideb:
I tell you, it was total carnage. Flames everywhere and the old stick in full fettle!
Ryunosuke:
Out of interest, what time of day was that?
Garrideb:
Hm, not sure I can remember. It was two days ago now. Let's see... Around five o'clock, I think.
Susato:
So at exactly the same time... ...as a terrifying incident was unfolding outside your window on the street below.
Garrideb:
Hmph. Even more terrifying on the inside, I can assure you. The whole of Blighty could have been flattened outside my window at that moment... ...and I wouldn't have noticed a dashed thing!
Susato:
Oh...really?
Garrideb:
.........
Joan:
.........
Sholmes:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Um, Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
Yes, Mr Naruhodo? What can I do for you?
Ryunosuke:
Well, I think we've got to the bottom of Mr Garrideb's situation now. But what does it have to do with Mr Natsume's circumstances?
Sholmes:
I can't help you there, I'm afraid.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, if you recall, I did say as much from the outset. I warned you that although I knew the retired army man to be hiding something... ...I could not be sure whether his secret would prove to be of relevance or not.
Ryunosuke:
I... I just knew you were going to say that!
Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Now now, Mr Naruhodo. You mustn't lose heart. Bear in mind... ...that all things fall into one of only two categories: Those relevant to the case, and those not.
Ryunosuke:
...That makes no sense to me.
Sholmes:
Well, no matter. It is of far greater importance that you make up your mind now.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
Visiting hours at the prison will soon be over.
Ryunosuke:
...! (Oh no! Is it that time already?)
Susato:
If we're to accept Mr Natsume's case... ...we have official paperwork to attend to.
Ryunosuke:
......... (So that's it. No more time to think.)
Joan:
Perhaps you'd like to betake yourselves to bidding us farewell now? I must prepare supper for Mr Garrideb.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, oh yes... I'm so sorry.
Susato:
Thank you both very much for your time.
Ryunosuke:
(Soseki-san will be waiting for us. And I'm going to have to give him an answer...)
Examine
John Garrideb or Joan Garrideb
Joan:
I'm terribly sorry, Mr Narrow-Hollow... ...but I'm afraid it's suppertime now. I'll have to ask you to leave.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes... I'm sorry.
Susato:
If we linger too long, Mrs Garrideb will start pouring tea again.
Ryunosuke:
...No one wants that. Alright, shall we go then? (No doubt Soseki-san is beside himself in his cell, waiting for us to return. I can't afford to spend any longer making up my mind...)
Scorch mark
Ryunosuke:
What a miserable sight.
Susato:
Oh dear. But at least the whole room wasn't engulfed in flames.
Garrideb:
Hmph. I suppose so. But my whole collection went up in smoke, you know. All those novels I adored so much.
Joan:
Tsk. Well, John, whose fault is that?
Garrideb:
Not mine, that's for sure!
Joan:
......... Well...whoever may or may not be to blame... ...I'm quite sure you can buy some new old books to replace them, can't you?
Garrideb:
Hmph! 'New old books'? Bally nonsense!
Ryunosuke:
(It does sound like a contradiction in terms. But then these two are full of contradictions.)
Susato:
Hee hee, that's couples for you, Mr Naruhodo. ...Or so I've been led to believe.
Move to any other location except Mr Natsume's Room:
19th February
Briar Road
Susato:
It's time, Mr Naruhodo. We must hurry back to the prison!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I know. Let's hail a carr- ......... Oh.
Susato:
What's the matter?
Ryunosuke:
It looks like something's going on over there in front of the Garridebs' house.
Susato:
...?
???:
I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers!
???:
Who are you calling an old man...you rum-lookin' niminy-piminy?!
???:
'There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'
???:
Who's this Horatio fella, eh? What are you on about?
Susato:
Excuse me...
???:
Eh? What the...? Who are you now?
Susato:
I'm sorry, it just looked as though there might be some problem here. And my associate here, Mr Ryunosuke Naruhodo, is a lawyer, you see.
???:
Eh? A lawyer? ...What?
Ryunosuke:
If I can be of any assistance, I'd be happy to help. I'm from Japan, but I have studied English law.
???:
Tsk! Fine! I'll be on me way for today. But you mark my words! This ain't over yet!
???:
Get thee to a nunnery!
???:
Do I look like a bloomin' nun to you?!
Susato:
I do hope you're not injured?
???:
O, fair Eastern maiden, thou art so gentle! Thank you!
Ryunosuke:
What was that all about?
???:
'There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'
Ryunosuke:
Erm...I'm not Horatio, either.
Susato:
Forgive the enquiry, sir, but... ...are you a lodger here? In the Garrideb residence?
???:
O, fair Eastern maiden, thou art so right! Yes, I do dwell in this humble abode.
Ryunosuke:
(Mr Garrideb mentioned that he had another lodger, didn't he? This must be the man.) Do you happen to know the other lodger, who lives on the first floor?
???:
Ah, yes. A gentleman named Natsume? O, more worthy a polemist in my battle of words ne'er could there be!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? Battle, did you say?
???:
Who is the stronger, Hamlet or Macbeth? Mr Natsume and I sparred long into the night!
Ryunosuke:
...I see.
Susato:
I, I don't fully understand, but it seems Mr Natsume and this gentleman are acquaintances at least.
???:
So, fair maiden! So good gentleman... ...I can tarry here no longer! Fare thee well!
Susato:
I didn't really understand him, but I think he's returned to his room.
Ryunosuke:
It seems he's unaware of what's happened to Mr Natsume, so he can't really help us. (With Soseki-san and that man as lodgers, the Garrideb house is certainly full of eccentrics.) Anyway, I'll go and find a carriage.
Susato:
Yes. I'm sure Mr Natsume is eagerly awaiting our return!
Ryunosuke:
(Let's hope we can get to the prison before visiting hours are over.)
19th February, 6:31 p.m.
Local Prison, Cell 9
Soseki:
......... Oh! It's you! You're here! You came! Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAME BACK! I'M SO TOUCHED!
Susato:
We are so sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr Natsume.
Soseki:
Oh! No! Th-Think nothing of it! R-R-R-Relax! If, if I were a cat, I would purr with pleasure at the company of such fine compatriots.
Noble, Nurturing, Never-Failing Nipponese!
Ryunosuke:
Oh now, let's not get carried away.
???:
Oh, I quite agree. There is nothing more reassuring than the familiarity of one's native land. On the other hand...
Sholmes:
...it is through friendship transcending international borders that one truly appreciates the fact. Such is my belief, at least.
Soseki:
Ah! Oh! It's... Yes! Agh! It's... It's YOU! THE MISERABLE, ROTTEN SPY! HERR LOCK SHOLMES!!!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes! What are you doing here?
Sholmes:
I have no intention of 'doing' anything per se. Save observing, of course.
Susato:
Whatever do you mean, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Well, having encountered some curious reading material in that gloomful room... ...and having unmasked the secret identity of that eccentric pair... ...I decided I should drop in on my way home. To see how our divested friend is faring.
Soseki:
Gloomful room?
Sholmes:
At least your accommodation here offers a window, my dear fellow. In that sense, it is the superior option. Anyway, I must commend you on your taste in books. My day has been a delight, and cost me not a penny.
Soseki:
AAARGH!!! YOUUU!!! HOW DARE YOU, HERR LOCK SHOLMES!!! ......... .........Ugh. I've had it. I'm through. I'm at the end of my rope. I should never have come to Great Britain. It was a terrible mistake. Haunted by spirits in those accursed lodgings... No doubt my luck will be cursed in tomorrow's trial as well... MY WHOLE LIFE IS BEDAMNED!
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
What are you thinking, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
...He mentioned that once before, didn't he? That his lodgings were cursed, I mean.
Sholmes:
And there is much truth in Mr Moustache's words.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Sholmes:
'Cursed' is a wholly appropriate description, I would say. For the man's lodgings...and indeed for tomorrow's trial.
Ryunosuke:
(...What's that supposed to mean?)
Converse
Cursed trial
Ryunosuke:
Mr Natsume, what did you mean by what you said just now? About the trial tomorrow being cursed?
Soseki:
Oh no! Why, why are you looking so grave? You're m-making me nervous! I was just getting carried away, that's all! I, I didn't mean anything by it!
Ryunosuke:
Oh...I see. (That's really agitated him...)
Soseki:
You... You... You don't mean...? The trial really IS cursed somehow?!
Sholmes:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Are you referring to the prosecutor? The Reaper of the Bailey?
Soseki:
The, the reaper?! Oh no! What do you mean? Please! Tell me! Summarise it succinctly in sixteen salient words!
Ryunosuke:
No defendant has ever survived a trial in which the Reaper stands for the prosecution...ever.
Soseki:
......... OH MY GOODNESS! CAN IT REALLY BE TRUE?! THAT WAS SIXTEEN WORDS EXACTLY!!!
Susato:
Yesterday, Mr Naruhodo successfully defended someone against the Reaper. But then...after the trial was over... ...the defendant passed away in...unusual circumstances.
Ryunosuke:
(Mr McGilded...)
Soseki:
Wha... Wha... Wha... WHAAAT?!
Sholmes:
Ah, I am impressed, Miss Susato. You have an eye for detail.
Susato:
Actually, the Lord Chief Justice told us.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes... ...surely it can't be that having failed the have the accused convicted... ...Lord van Zieks killed the man himself?
Susato:
Oh no! He couldn't have, surely?
Sholmes:
......... Ah ha ha ha ha hah! You have some wonderful notions!
Ryunosuke:
...Sorry?
Sholmes:
The man isn't a mass murderer; he's a court prosecutor, my dear fellow!
Susato:
Oh...yes... Why, of course he is!
Soseki:
Argh! 'Of course he is'?! THEN WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SCARE ME?!
Sholmes:
It could be said, however... ...that the real truth about the man is even more terrifying than your hypothesis.
Susato:
...!
Ryunosuke:
What on earth do you mean by that?
The Reaper (appears after "Cursed trial")
Sholmes:
Van Zieks is a quite exceptional man. However, in London courts of law... ...'exceptional' does not equate to winning every case without exception.
Soseki:
Aah! That's, that's good!
Ryunosuke:
(Soseki-san looks like he's going to cry tears of joy.)
Sholmes:
As you are no doubt aware, in a British criminal trial, there is both a judge and a jury. The judge officiates based on the letter of the law, whilst the jury offers public opinion and common sense. It is an excellent system, whereby the defendant's guilt is considered from several points of view. However, public opinion, in particular, is somewhat easily manipulated.
Ryunosuke:
Right...
Sholmes:
Criminals, and corrupt lawyers for that matter, can use it to their advantage. By any means at their disposal. Contriving evidence, calling imposters as witnesses, and so on. By such underhand means, those who would want to are able to sway the jury. Which means that even in the light of irrefutable evidence, the prosecution can fail.
Susato:
But it means the wrong verdict can be passed!
Sholmes:
And sadly is from time to time, my dear madam. It is simply the reality of the situation.. [sic]
Ryunosuke:
(And that's alright?)
Sholmes:
However... ...those indicted by Lord van Zieks cannot escape justice. Their fate is sealed.
Susato:
Oh my...
Sholmes:
Though the adjudication may see them leave the courtroom with their freedom... ...within months, they all...disappear! It is most striking.
Soseki:
D-Disappear? But, but how?
Sholmes:
Ah, by all manner of misfortune, sir. Perhaps they are trampled under a passing carriage. Perhaps they fall into the Thames and drown. Perhaps they are suddenly overcome by a raging fever. Or perhaps attacked by highwaymen.
Soseki:
Oh no no no...
Sholmes:
All examples of the reality here in London, I'm afraid, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
.........
Soseki:
Haah... I knew it. I'm...
A Dead Dodo, Done for, DOOMED!
Cursed lodgings
Ryunosuke:
When you said 'accursed lodgings' before, you were referring to your room at Mr Garrideb's house, I assume? Do you mean to say you believe the place is cursed?
Soseki:
......... It's been a year now since I came to Great Britain. But I'd only been in London a week before I started to notice strange feelings in myself.
Ryunosuke:
...That didn't take long then.
Soseki:
Everywhere I looked there were foreign faces staring at me... Laughing behind my back... I, I was sure people were talking about me. I started to become nervous about going outside. They were always staring at me! All the time! From dawn till dusk! So I shut myself away in my room. ...But even that didn't help. The fear wouldn't go away.
Susato:
You must have been very lonely, having been away from your homeland for such a long time.
Soseki:
I've had to move a number of times. Most recently, to that room on Briar Road, a week ago now.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, why did you choose there? It seems a little...inconvenient.
Soseki:
The rent is cheap. I have so little money, it appealed to me straight away. Of course, I asked why it was so affordable. The landlord just simpered and said: 'The room is cursed. ...Oops!' He quickly tried to cover his mistake, but it was too late. So I told him... ...if you have something to say, then say it! But if not, DON'T MENTION IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!
Ryunosuke:
Yes. ...Well said.
Soseki:
But it was true! It was all t-t-true!
Ryunosuke:
You mean... (...the room really is cursed, then?)
Soseki:
Ever since I moved into that windowless hellhole... ...my sleep has been plagued with nightmares! I awake feeling as though I'm being choked to death! And in my waking hours, people are stabbed in front of me as I walk down the street... I'm branded a killer... Thrown in prison... Nobody wants to know me... I'm, I'm...
Surrounded by Scary, Sinister Spirits!
If only there was someone... Just one person on my side... Can no one find it in his or her heart to believe in me? Really no one at all?
Ryunosuke:
(To believe... Yes, to believe...)
To believe (appears after "Cursed lodgings")
Ryunosuke:
Um, Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
Ah. Me, Mr Naruhodo? Pray, what can I do for you?
Ryunosuke:
It's about the case on the SS Burya. If you recall?
Sholmes:
The Burya... The Burya... ...Ah, that case!  The one with the snake?
Ryunosuke:
...Well, yes. At that time, I was the suspect. But you believed in me and listened to my side of the story. And you helped us to investigate.
Sholmes:
...I did, did I? Interesting.
Ryunosuke:
What I want to know is...why? Why did you believe me?
Sholmes:
I see, yes. You mean... ...because you were a grimly dressed, shady Eastern fellow found with the victim in a locked room?
Ryunosuke:
Um, well...if you like, yes.
Sholmes:
I'm a little surprised that the answer requires explanation, my dear fellow. It's quite simple, really. You said, 'I didn't do it.'
Ryunosuke:
But! I could have been lying! Surely you must have had your doubts? You must have suspected me a little.
Sholmes:
......... I think perhaps you have misunderstood. I neither recall believing in you, nor in that which you were telling me.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Sholmes:
You see... ...the only things I believe in...are those I choose to believe in!
Susato:
What... What do you mean, Mr Sholmes?!
Sholmes:
I make up my own mind about what is to be believed and what is not. If I should like to believe in something, I do. The circumstances can hang as far as I am concerned.
Ryunosuke:
But...I could have betrayed your trust!
Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! In that case, I should have made an elementary error of judgement, nothing more. Betrayal of trust is an overused excuse, in my opinion.
Ryunosuke:
Meaning...?
Sholmes:
Whether or not one should trust another is, in the final analysis, down to oneself. It is a matter of whether or not one can trust oneself.
Soseki:
Yes! YES! He's right! He's RIGHT, Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire!
Ryunosuke:
......... (Whether or not I can believe myself...)
Kazuma:
'A defence lawyer is only as good as his faith in his client. And that comes down to how much faith he has in himself.'
Ryunosuke:
(You were so right, Kazuma...)
Present
Secondhand Book Receipt
Ryunosuke:
We found this receipt in your room, Mr Natsume.
Soseki:
That's right. I went out to buy some new old books.
Ryunosuke:
(Isn't that a contradiction in terms?) And, it was on your way back to your room that you saw the woman being stabbed?
Soseki:
'She's dead!' I thought to myself. 'SHE'S DEAD!!!' My mind went completely blank. B-Before I knew it, I was back in my room, t-trembling like a leaf.
Ryunosuke:
(The bookworm hoping to worm his way out of a bad situation...?)
Susato:
......... Mr Naruhodo... ...please do be careful not to think such disparaging thoughts.
Ryunosuke:
(How could you possibly know...?)
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Um, Mr Natsume, would you take this and-
Soseki:
Oh! The joy! The sheer joy of a gift from my fellow countryman! The Complete Kindness of Kith and Kin!
Ryunosuke:
Oh no... Sorry, I just wanted to show you.
Soseki:
......... The Complete Cruelty of Kith and Kin!
Ryunosuke:
(...Oops.)
After clearing all Converse options:
Sholmes:
Well, my dear fellows, it is time we were leaving, I believe.
Susato:
Already?!
Sholmes:
Visiting hours are over. The guard will be here shortly to escort us out. There is a restaurant near here that serves excellent trout. Would you care to join me?
Soseki:
...!
Susato:
Oh dear. There is never enough time, is there?
Soseki:
......... .........
Ryunosuke:
Erm...Mr Natsume... ...if you'd like, in the trial tomorrow... ...I'd be happy to represent you.
Susato:
...!
Soseki:
L...L... Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire...
Ryunosuke:
......... As I said, I only experienced a British courtroom for the first time yesterday. And although the man I was representing was found not guilty, I lost sight of something crucial.
Soseki:
Something crucial?
Ryunosuke:
What to believe in: the defendant, justice or the truth. How to believe, even. But...I think I've finally worked it out. I've decided I must believe in myself above all else. To trust my instincts.
Susato:
Yes, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
And my instincts are telling me that you, Mr Natsume, are innocent of this crime. And it's imperative that we prove that in court.
Soseki:
Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire...
Ryunosuke:
I will fight for your innocence until the bitter end, with every weapon available to me. So I hope you'll permit me...to represent you tomorrow.
Soseki:
......... As I said when we first met... ...I'd like to entrust my fate to someone who will listen to me...in my native tongue.
Ryunosuke:
Of course, Mr Natsume.
Sholmes:
It would be fair to say, Mr Naruhodo... ...that your mind was, in many ways, made up from the outset. You merely needed the events of today to fully realise it.
Ryunosuke:
Yes... I think you're right about that. (It's been a roundabout journey, but I got there in the end.) Miss Susato...
Susato:
Yes?
Ryunosuke:
Would you be willing to stand by my side tomorrow and help me in court?
Susato:
......... Absolutely! As I said this morning... ...you may consider me your personal judicial assistant!
Ryunosuke:
(The shocking events of yesterday's trial still weigh heavily on my mind. But it's time to stop looking backwards. Kazuma believed in me. And Mr Sholmes believes in me now, too. So it's time... Time that I learnt to believe in myself. Soseki-san has no one. He's all alone. So it's my job to help him. To fight his corner. Tomorrow. In the courtroom. With all the strength I can muster!)
To be continued...
Examine insignificant area on evidence
Ryunosuke:
I can't find anything out of place.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Ryunosuke:
I've investigated thoroughly, but... I can't find anything out of place.
Presenting wrong evidence during Logic and Reasoning Spectacular
Sholmes:
What precisely was your intention with that, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Just following the natural progression of the deduction! Sometimes the truth hurts!
Sholmes:
Well, the truth is, you do not have a turn for observation or deduction. ...Did that hurt?
Ryunosuke:
Yes... A lot...
Presenting wrong evidence during Logic and Reasoning Spectacular
Sholmes:
What spectacularly contrived logic led you to this mindless conclusion?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, well, um...it's supposed to be a 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular', so...I thought I'd contribute to the show!
Sholmes:
This is my show, Mr Naruhodo. Kindly perform any peculiar experiments on your own stage.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... Sorry.
