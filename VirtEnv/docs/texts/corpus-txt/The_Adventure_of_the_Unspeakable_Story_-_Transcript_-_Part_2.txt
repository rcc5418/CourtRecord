Part 1
Part 2
When I awoke the following morning, Susato-san was already gone. Outside the window, the rain came down in sheets. And so began an even longer day than the last. One that I would remember for the rest of my days...
Examine evidence
Pawnbroker's Ticket (Coat)
Bloody fingermark
Ryunosuke:
It was blood, this stain, like we suspected.
Iris:
That's right! Hurley's wonderful concoction soon proved that!
Ryunosuke:
I, I don't suppose... Gina couldn't have been wearing leather gloves that night, could she?
Iris:
......... Ginny would never wear gloves! She's a pickpocket! She relies on being able to feel with her fingertips!
Ryunosuke:
(I could be wrong, but I think I'm being told off...)
Iris's Story Manuscript
Title
Ryunosuke:
'The Hound of the Baskervilles'...
Iris:
That's right! I used Daddy's notes to write it. I think it's a great story! I don't know why Hurley's forbidden me to publish it.
Ryunosuke:
No, it's strange, isn't it? Perhaps it's a problem with the title? Perhaps Mr Sholmes is a family friend of someone who has that name or something?
Iris:
Hmmm... Well, it doesn't have quite the same ring to it, but I could change it to 'The Hound of the Naruhodos'...
Ryunosuke:
...I'm fairly sure that Mr Sholmes is a friend of someone who has that name, too.
17th April, 9:32 a.m.
The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber
Ryunosuke:
Good morning, Gina.
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
I'm determined to prove your innocence today. I'm sure we can do it!
Gina:
......... So where's yer friend then?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gina:
Ya know, 'er in the fancy dress. ...Susarto or 'owever you say it. I dunno.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, Miss Susato had to leave early in the morning. She was already gone by the time I woke up.
Gina:
......... You alright wiv that, are ya? Forget about me, if ya like. Go and see 'er off.
Ryunosuke:
...It's fine. It's not as though Miss Susato and I won't meet again... one day.
Gina:
E-Even so...
Ryunosuke:
But you, Gina... ...you only get one chance. This trial today is all we have.
Gina:
...!
???:
Good morning, you two!
Iris:
How are you feeling, Ginny? Did you manage to sleep?
Wagahai:
Miaow...
Gina:
Iris! Wot are you doin' 'ere?
Iris:
What do you mean? When a friend is in need, we show our support! Isn't that right, Waggy?
Wagahai:
Miaow...
Iris:
Ah! Waggy!
Ryunosuke:
(...Great way to show your support, kitty.)
Gina:
Let 'im 'ave a nose around. Wot 'arm can it do?
Iris:
Oh, that reminds me. I bought a paper on the way here. Now, would you like the good news or the bad news? What do you say, Runo? Ginny?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, well, I think I'd rather get the bad news out of the way first.
Gina:
Nah, always take the good news first. Ya might not live to 'ear the bad.
Iris:
Yes...that question always gives away people's personalities.
Ryunosuke:
...Let's not go there.
Iris:
Alright then, I'll give you the bad news first. A record amount of rain has fallen this morning, and carriages all over the capital are struggling to move.
Ryunosuke:
...Huh? (The bad news...was a weather report?)
Iris:
So I hope that Susie made her train to Dover and that the train isn't delayed on its way to the port.
Ryunosuke:
Gosh...yes.
Gina:
Alright then, so wot's the good news?
Iris:
Well! The rain is forcast to subside this afternoon. So even if the train is delayed, it should be able to make up the time later! Well? That is good news, isn't it?
Gina:
I couldn't give a monkey's, really.
Ryunosuke:
(If only all good news cancelled out the bad.)
Iris:
And look! This trial has made the headlines, too! 'Pawnbroker Perishes in Pickpurse Plunder!' See?
Gina:
Tsk, 'ow d'you like that? Well let 'em say wot they want! See if I care!
Ryunosuke:
(...I can't, because you're covering your face.)
Iris:
Don't worry! Runo will soon show everyone that this headline is nonsense.
Ryunosuke:
I will?
Iris:
And then, in tomorrow's papers, the headline will be: 'Discharged Diver is Dauntless Do-Gooder!' ...Isn't that right, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, um...yes. Let's hope so.
Iris:
Of course they will! I have absolute faith in you! ...How was that? I was trying to sound like Susie. Did it work? Did it?
Ryunosuke:
(...It's like she was still here.)
Today's paper has been entered into the Court Record.
Iris:
Good luck then, Runo. I'll do what I can!
Examine evidence
Today's Paper
Picture of pawnbrokery or Pop Windibank
Iris:
'Pawnbroker Perishes in Pickpurse Plunder!' ...How awful! ...For Ginny, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
But tomorrow's headline will be, 'Discharged Diver is Dauntless Do-Gooder!' ...Right?
Iris:
Yes, something like that... If possible, I'd like to go even bigger.
Ryunosuke:
(Bigger? How?)
Iris:
'Proud Pickpocket Protects Planet Post-Trial!'...perhaps?
Ryunosuke:
'Protects planet'?
Iris:
Ooh, I can't wait for tomorrow now! It's going to be so great!
Picture on back
Iris:
There's a sensational story lower down the front page as well, look. 'Ministry Mole? Classified Secrets May Have Been Leaked Overseas From Ministry of Justice'
Ryunosuke:
(For a ten-year-old... ...Iris certainly has her finger on the pulse of world news.)
Iris:
It's about secret communications between Great Britain and its allies. Apparently they're being intercepted by hostile nations.
Ryunosuke:
Communications are being intercepted? But how would somebody be doing that?
Iris:
That's the question, isn't it? I've come up with three different possible methods so far. ...Are you looking for a new career, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
No! Of course not! I wonder... Perhaps this is what Lord Stronghart was talking about yesterday.
Iris:
Yes, it could be. And it could explain why he has Gregsy running from pillar to post at the moment.
The details of today's paper have been updated in the Court Record.

Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Iris:
Obviously, I don't know the law like Susie does, but still... ...I'll be by your side the whole time, giving you moral support and encouragement.
Ryunosuke:
...I'm not sure that big thing is as comforting as you think it is, to be honest, but... ...thank you, Iris. That's very kind of you.
Gina:
Oh yeah, Iris...
Iris:
Yes, Ginny?
Gina:
Well... ...I was wonderin', is all. About Sholmes. Did they fix 'im up alright?
Iris:
Yes...the operation was a great success. But...Hurley still hasn't come around yet.
Gina:
Eh?
Iris:
I've asked a friend of mine at Scotland Yard... ...to send a telegram as soon as he wakes up.
Ryunosuke:
(I'm sure Gregson will let us know the moment there's news.)
Gina:
Oh...right...
Ryunosuke:
(No Susato-san, and no Mr Sholmes... It's all down to me today...to prove that Gina is innocent  of this crime!)
Bailiff:
Miss Gina Lestrade! Counsel for the Defence! The trial is about to begin! Please make your way into the courtroom!
Iris:
It's time, then.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Let's go, Gina. Iris.
Iris:
Lead the way, Runo!
Ryunosuke:
Poor Gina... She's trying to put on a brave face, but I can tell she's worried and scared. I have to believe in her from start to finish. That's the weapon that will secure our victory here. If I learnt anything from my great friend...it's that.
17th April, 10:00 a.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. This trial shall determine the guilt or innocence of Miss Gina Lestrade. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.
Van Zieks:
The prosecution is ready.
Ryunosuke:
The defence...is ready.
Judge:
Lord van Zieks...
Van Zieks:
...My Lord?
Judge:
Remind me, how many years ago was it that you withdrew from the public prosecution service?
Van Zieks:
......... It was some five years ago, My Lord.
Judge:
Yes, and then two months ago you resurfaced somewhat unexpectedly. And here you are again today. Are there some circumstances of which the court should be aware that have led to this...erratic behaviour?
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
In what one might describe as your former life five years past... ...you dealt exclusively in matters concerned with the highest echelons of society and government.
Ryunosuke:
...! (Really...?)
Judge:
Yet today you choose to try a simple case of burglary and murder. I confess I find it more than a little befuddling, Counsel.
Van Zieks:
......... There are two types of person I cannot abide. Firstly, those wealthy scoundrels who hide behind a mask of philanthropy to cheat the public at large...
Iris:
He means Mr McGilded, who you defended against the Reaper two months ago.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, I'd just about managed to work that out. Thank you. (Magnus McGilded... If I'd known what a monster he was, I never would have defended him.)
Van Zieks:
...And secondly - even more loathsome... ...those wily scoundrels who masquerade as allies only to effect total betrayal in the final hour. In other words, the confidence tricksters from those tiny islands in the Far East...the Nipponese!
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?! (Did he really just say that?!)
Iris:
He means you now, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
...I actually managed to work that out, too. Thank you, Iris. 'Total betrayal'? What are you talking about?
Van Zieks:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(That torrid look of hatred in Lord van Zieks's eyes... Was that directed solely at me? Or was he talking about all Japanese people?)
Judge:
......... An alarmingly scathing explanation, Lord van Zieks. Still, the judiciary welcomes the return of the so-called 'Reaper of the Bailey', feared by all London's malefactors.
Van Zieks:
...Your Lordship is too kind.
Judge:
Now, jurors... The six of you have been selected at random to represent the will of the people in this trial. Are you ready to hear the evidence placed before you, and determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant?
Juror No. 1:
Former lieutenant in the British Army here, don't you know. Chaps like me were born ready!
Juror No. 2:
Clean crockery, clean cutlery and a clean conscience. His Lordship's motto is very appropriate here, I think.
Juror No. 3:
Everything will be stereoscopic in the future! Absolutely, absolutely everything! And I'm ready for it!
Juror No. 4:
I don't understand it. I can't have left it in there. It's not possible. ...But could I have?
Juror No. 5:
Women indispensable in society. Stop. Female-centric future awaits. Stop.
Juror No. 6:
'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.'
Ryunosuke:
.........
Iris:
Is something wrong, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
Oh...not exactly. It's just... ...I'm fairly sure I recognise these jurors. Almost all of them, in fact...
Iris:
Reeeally? Funny coincidences like that do happen from time to time, don't they? But it is quite strange. The jurors are chosen at random from London's six million inhabitants, you know.
Ryunosuke:
...So I've been led to believe. (But something tells me I'm being duped.)
Judge:
Very well. Now, Lord van Zieks... ...the court calls upon the prosecution to introduce the facts of the case.
Van Zieks:
As you wish, My Lord. Allow me to begin with a word of warning to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury. In short... ...there has never been a more self-evident case of cold-blooded murder.
Juror No. 1:
...!
Juror No. 3:
...!
Van Zieks:
The victim, Mr Pop Windibank, proprietor of a pawn shop on Baker Street, was shot from behind and died instantly. The prosecution presents this photographic print of the crime scene. As the court will observe, there is a single bullet wound just below the gentleman's left shoulder. The evidence suggests that the bullet pierced the man's heart resulting in near instant death. Moving on to the findings of Scotland Yard's coroner... His report states that the bullet entered the body on a rising diagonal trajectory.
Ryunosuke:
And...what's that supposed to tell us?
Van Zieks:
It means...the victim was likely shot by someone significantly shorter in height than himself. Someone...like the accused, you might say.
Juror No. 2:
Oh!
Juror No. 5:
...!
Van Zieks:
The prosecution wishes to present the autopsy report and crime scene photograph as evidence, My Lord.
Judge:
Indeed. The court accepts. Hand them to the bailiff, please.
The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.
The crime scene photograph has been entered into the Court Record.
Van Zieks:
I now ask the court to turn its attention to this plan of the establishment where the incident occurred. The proprietor, was found in the storeroom where he kept articles pawned to him. A windowless room with a single point of entry - a door to the main shop that was found locked. In this 'sealed chamber' there were only two persons present: The victim, Mr Windibank...and the accused.
Gina:
.........
Juror No. 4:
...!
Juror No. 6:
...!
Van Zieks:
It may further interest the court to know that when the accused was discovered at the scene... ...she had in her hand the gun used to fire the fatal bullet!
...Well, that's that then, isn't it? Nothing more to say.
...Isn't that grubby little girl a pickpocket anyway?
...She's one of those filthy drabs that live in the slums in the East End.
Oh well, it was only a matter of time before she got blood on her hands, then......What are the jurors waiting for? The girl's guilty as hell!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
We can't jump to conclusions here! We mustn't assume her guilt because of what she has to do to survive!
Van Zieks:
...My learned Nipponese...friend. It is you who mustn't jump to conclusions. The prosecution has barely begun presenting its case.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
Conveniently, this appalling act of murder... ...did not go unobserved. There were witnesses.
Judge:
Good gracious!
Van Zieks:
After their testimony, this girl's true nature will be exposed. Pitiful pickpurse...or cold-hearted killer? Here's to establishing the truth.
Gina:
.........
Judge:
Hmmm... The court will take the floor plan and firearm into evidence. Hand them to the bailiff, please, Lord van Zieks.
Van Zieks:
...At once, My Lord.
The crime scene floor plan has been entered into the Court Record.
Windibank's revolver has been entered into the Court Record.
Examine evidence
Windibank's Gun
Bullet cylinder
Ryunosuke:
This is Mr Windibank's gun. The cylinder is completely empty.
Iris:
Mr Windibank always used to keep this gun to hand on his shop counter.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, but only ever with a single bullet loaded, I understand.
Iris:
That's right. To keep all the pawned articles that were in his care safe.
Ryunosuke:
(But his one bullet was fired that night, and the poor man lost his life. Was he protecting his shop, I wonder? Trying to keep the articles safe?)
Iris:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(This isn't good.)
Iris:
I feel like the mood in here has turned very gloomy all of a sudden, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
I think...that's because it has.
Van Zieks:
Let us begin! Bring forth the witnesses to the foul murder of Mr Pop Windibank on 16th April of this year!
Van Zieks:
Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court.
Nash:
Name's Nash Skulkin! Occupation is, erm...baddie. Profeshnal baddie.
Ringo:
Name's Ringo Skulkin! Occupation's, um...same as 'im.
Gregson:
...Tobias Gregson. Scotland Yard inspector.
Nash:
That's right. We're wot they call...
...the Three Skulkin Bruvvers!.........
Gregson:
What are you lookin' at me like that for?! Don't lump me in with you lot!
Nash:
Cor blimey, that's cold! Don'tcha know wot we're goin' fru?
Ringo:
It's our older bruv! Lost contact wiv 'im, we 'ave! So we're scourin' every shady corner o' the capital!
Nash:
And then last night, we come across you! The very spit o' the bloke. Ain't that right, Ringo?
Ringo:
'E is, Nash, 'e is! The very spit of 'im!
Nash:
So we decided there an' then wot we woz gonna do. We woz gonna call ya...
Ringo:
...Big Bruv Sulky!
Gregson:
Come on, leave it out, you two!
Ryunosuke:
(...Sulky Skulkin? And that's before he's run out of chips...)
Judge:
Well then...Inspector Sulky Gregson...
Gregson:
Beggin' your pardon, My Lord, but the name's Tobias.
Judge:
What I would like to know, Inspector, is what you are doing in the witness stand.
Van Zieks:
The Skulkin Brothers are currently under arrest, My Lord, on suspicion of theft.
Judge:
Hmph. Thieves, are they, these three?
Gregson:
No, My Lord. Beggin' your pardon, but please don't lump me in with this lot.
Van Zieks:
Two nights ago, these two brothers illegally entered an establishment with intent to burgle. And in the course of their nefarious activities, they became embroiled in a far more sinister crime.
Judge:
By Jove, you mean to say...? What an extraordinary coincidence!
Van Zieks:
...Indeed, My Lord. While attempting to burglarise the pawnbrokery, they witnessed its proprietor's murder.
Judge:
Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar!
Van Zieks:
The various trespasses of these brothers is not the subject of today's proceedings... ...though they will naturally face trial in the very near future.
Gregson:
With Your Lordship's permission, I'd like to remain in the stand to keep these gents on the straight and narrow.
Judge:
Of course, Inspector. Sceptical as I am about the calibre of these witnesses, I will permit them to take the stand.
Van Zieks:
Mr and Mr Skulkin...you will now testify before the court. Describe the events of the night in question, and what exactly you saw.
'Appy to! ...Cos a Skulkin's never skulkin'!
Gregson:
...Get out of it!
Witness Testimony
- Illegal Entry -
Nash:
We woz walkin' down Baker Street in the small hours, an' the gaff's door was ajar, see?
Ringo:
It woz like some kinda sign. Beggin' for us to go in, it woz!
Nash:
But once we got inside, cor blimey lummy! We 'eard a gunshot from the back room!
Ringo:
We went to see wot woz wot, but the door was locked from the inside.
Nash:
We never done nuffin', guvnor! We never took nuffin'! We just left after that, nice an' quiet.
Judge:
Hmmm... A terrible coincidence, it would seem. At the precise moment these miscreants entered the property, an even more sinister crime was afoot.
Van Zieks:
The witnesses' testimony is consistent with the crime scene in every detail. The door providing access to the storeroom from the main shop was indeed locked from the inside. And within, only the victim and the accused were found.
Judge:
Hmmm... I must say, it does appear to be an overwhelmingly simple case. Still, the defence may cross-examine the witnesses now, of course. Counsel, if you please...
Ryunosuke:
.........
Judge:
Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Ah...erm...yes!
Iris:
What's the matter, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry, I... ...I was just stunned into silence for a minute by the blatant lies being told by that pair in the stand. (I know that it's all nonsense. Because I saw it with my own eyes! I'll just have to expose their testimony for the pack of lies it is!)
Cross-Examination
- Illegal Entry -
Nash:
We woz walkin' down Baker Street in the small hours, an' the gaff's door was ajar, see?
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
The front door of Windibank's was ajar, you say? What time of night was this?
Nash:
Must've been about one. ...Right, Ringo?
Ringo:
Yeah, I'd say so. ...Right, Sulky?
Gregson:
How would I know? The place would've been shut at one in the mornin'. Just like every other shop in town.
Nash:
Well it woz pitch-black inside, it's true. ...Ain't that right, Ringo?
Ringo:
I'm not so sure, Nash. I seem to remember a little light burnin' inside. Wot about you, Sulky, me old mucker?
Gregson:
...Leave me alone.
Ryunosuke:
(There definitely was a small lamp burning inside. That's what alerted us to the situation in the first place.)
Van Zieks:
And when these gentlemen ventured into the open establishment... ...the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, already had the muzzle of her gun trained on the unfortunate victim.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
That is pure conjecture!
Judge:
Hmmm...
Van Zieks:
Hah, perhaps. But it changes nothing. These brothers inadvertently wandered into the middle of a cold-blooded murder... ...simply because they found the door of the victim's establishment open and ventured inside.
Nash:
Right! That's wot 'appened!
Ringo:
It woz like some kinda sign. Beggin' for us to go in, it woz!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
What are you trying to suggest? That you had to go in?
Nash:
Well, God moves in mysterious ways, they say, dun't they, Ringo?
Ringo:
They do, Nash, they do. Must've been some sort o' providence, I reckon.
Ryunosuke:
...God's will often presents itself as the whim of thieves, does it?
Nash:
It weren't no whim. I'm dead sure o' that.
Ringo:
It weren't, Nash, it weren't. Like we said at the time...
Nash:
...Ya don't just find doors open in the middle o' the night like that. Nah, there's no two ways about it...
Ringo:
...It woz a sign that our long-lost bruvver was inside!
Iris:
They're not very good liars, are they?
Ringo:
Well...ya can't deny it. It led us to a bloke wot looks just like our bruv!
Gregson:
...I said, cut it out.
Ryunosuke:
(Those chips are getting a chomping today...)
Nash:
But once we got inside, cor blimey lummy! We 'eard a gunshot from the back room!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
A gunshot, you say. Just the one. Are you sure about that?
Nash:
Yup, just the one, guvnor. I can swear to that.
Ringo:
It woz, Nash, it woz. ...Ain't that right, Bruv?
Gregson:
...The firearm used belonged to the victim himself.
Iris:
Yes, Mr Windibank always used to leave his gun lying around on the counter.
Ryunosuke:
Right. I remember.
Gregson:
When we examined it, we found the revolver was completely out of rounds.
Iris:
That makes sense. Mr Windibank always used to say he only ever kept a single bullet loaded.
Ryunosuke:
(That's true. I remember him saying that as well.)
Judge:
So we can say with considerable certainty... ...that only a single round was discharged from the firearm used as the murder weapon.
Gregson:
Yes, My Lord. We can.
Van Zieks:
And I should remind the court... ...that the firearm in question was discovered in the hand of the accused.
Judge:
Hmmm...
Ryunosuke:
(...Wonderful.)
Ringo:
We went to see wot woz wot, but the door was locked from the inside.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Do you mean the door between the main shop and the storeroom?
Van Zieks:
If my learned friend is having difficulty grasping the situation, perhaps a drawing would help. Excluding the shop's entrance from the street, there is only one other door. That of the storeroom.
Nash:
'Course there woz only a little oil lamp burnin'. Not much to see by.
Ringo:
An' the door woz 'idden be'ind a curtain an' all.
Ryunosuke:
(That's right. When we arrived, the door was mostly obscured by the curtain.) Tell me... ...why exactly did you try to open that door?
Ringo:
Eh?
Ryunosuke:
Any normal petty thief would run at the sound of a gunshot, I should think.
Nash:
Oh, well, erm...your turn to rabbit, Ringo.
Ringo:
Well, Nash, erm...yeah... ...I s'pose...you'd 'ave to say we ain't 'normal', eh?
Van Zieks:
Broadly speaking, humans respond in one of two ways on hearing a gunshot or scream: The timid flee, gripped by fear, while the courageous investigate to see if they might help. These gentlemen are of the latter inclination. My learned Nipponese friend, it would seem, is of the former.
Ryunosuke:
(Alright... Somehow I just proved that I was a coward that night...)
Judge:
Thank you, Counsels... So, I believe we all understand that the door was locked and could not be opened. Proceed, witnesses...
Nash:
We never done nuffin', guvnor! We never took nuffin'! We just left after that, nice an' quiet.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Leads to:
"You didn't do or take anything..."
Iris:
What do you think about this pair, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
I think they're lying through their teeth, that's what I think. And I'm going to prove it!
Iris:
.........
Ryunosuke:
What is it, Iris?
Iris:
Weeell...I'm not really sure. There's just something a bit funny...about that prosecutor over there.
Ryunosuke:
Hm? (Wait, could this... ...could this testimony be some sort of a trap?)
Ryunosuke:
You didn't do or take anything... Is that your story?
Nash:
Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?
Ringo:
It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.
Ryunosuke:
So with no time to take your hands out of your pockets, you just left, nice and quietly, you say?
Nash:
That's right, guvnor. Nuffin' we 'ate more than violence. Peace-lovin' nibblers, we are, not bludgers.
Ringo:
We are, Nash, we are. Never even pulled me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.
Ryunosuke:
...So, you'd clearly like us to believe...
Nash:
Eh? Come again...?
Ryunosuke:
As you fled from the pawnbroker's that night... ...did you not run into anyone else?
Nash:
Um...
Ryunosuke:
And...did you not fire a gun at that person?!
Ringo:
Erm...
Judge:
Saints alive! They fired a gun, you say?
Nash:
AAAAAAGH!!! Blimey, guvnor!
Ringo:
You ain't tellin' us it woz you in the doorway?!
Ryunosuke:
It was.
Ringo:
......... Why the bleedin' Nora...
Nash:
...Didn't ya mention that before?!
Ryunosuke:
You were armed with a gun. And as you fled the scene, you fired that gun... ...at London's greatest detective, Herlock Sholmes!
They shot the great Mr Sholmes?
I did hear that, actually. There was a rumour he'd been rushed to hospital....The great Sholmes? That's beyond the pale!
Van Zieks:
On the night in question... ...this pair were arrested by the police within minutes of the discovery of the crime scene. ...Their suspicious countenance rapidly gave them away.
Ringo:
Hehe...
Van Zieks:
And when searched... ...a firearm was indeed found in their possession.

Van Zieks:
Furthermore, the barrel shows signs of a shot having been fired from it.
Juror No. 3:
...!
Juror No. 4:
...!
Van Zieks:
The prosecution invites His Lordship to examine the firearm recovered from these brothers.
Judge:
Yes, indeed... Remnants of powder around the muzzle, as you say, Counsel.
Juror No. 5:
...!
Juror No. 6:
...!
Judge:
The court will hold this weapon as evidence.
The Skulkin brothers' gun has been entered into the Court Record.
Van Zieks:
Now, my learned Nipponese friend...
Examine evidence
Skulkin Brothers' Gun
Bullet cylinder
Ryunosuke:
So, there's ammunition still loaded in five of this revolver's six cylinders.
Iris:
Yes, which tell us that only a single shot has been fired from it.
Ryunosuke:
Exactly.
Iris:
The bullet that hit Hurley in fact, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes... It happened almost as soon as we'd walked in through Windibank's door.
Iris:
......... I'll make those brothers pay.
Ryunosuke:
Y-Yes?
Van Zieks:
Here's to you successfully presenting the evidence.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
For yes, there are the telltale signs of spent powder on this gun, and a single bullet missing from the cylinder... ...but the prosecution demands evidence that it was fired at the scene of the crime under scrutiny in this trial!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Well, I don't need evidence! Because I was there!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
...However, the rest of us in this courtroom were not.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
If the defence fails to provide evidence in support of its rash claim... ...we shall have no choice but to toast your incompetence...and move on.
Ryunosuke:
(Evidence that these two fired that gun before they left Windibank's that night...)
Judge:
The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof. What evidence shows that these witnesses unloaded a firearm in the pawnbroker's shop that night?
Present Blood Samples Portfolio
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The evidence...is in this portfolio!"
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The evidence...is this!
Judge:
...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Van Zieks:
My learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer.
Ryunosuke:
AAARGH!
Iris:
Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally.
Ryunosuke:
The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...)
Leads back to:
"The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof."
Ryunosuke:
The evidence...is in this portfolio!
Judge:
What, what on earth have you there, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
During the course of our investigations, we discovered a number of bloodstains.
Van Zieks:
...Not trusting the police to do the job they're trained to do? How arrogantly Nipponese of you.
Ryunosuke:
W-Well anyway... ...we analysed all the blood samples we found and recorded the results in this portfolio.
Judge:
And you claim to have the evidence the court is demanding therein?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord.
Judge:
No more dallying then, Counsel. Present the pertinent evidence at once! What do you have in your portfolio that proves these witnesses unloaded a firearm at the scene?
Present Windibank's Main Shop sample
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"What is that? Explain!"
Present any other sample
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
THIS is the blood sample that proves it!
Judge:
...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Van Zieks:
You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen.
Ryunosuke:
AAARGH!
Iris:
Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally.
Ryunosuke:
The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...)
Leads back to:
"No more dallying then, Counsel."
Judge:
What is that? Explain!
Ryunosuke:
It's a photographic print taken at Windibank's pawnbrokery on the day of the incident.
Judge:
From the scene of the crime, is it? Is, is that... ...a bullet hole? And if my eyes do not deceive me, it appears the bullet is still lodged there.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, as Your Lordship noticed... ...the bullet pierced Mr Windibank's calendar. The date shown being the 16th of April - the very day of the pawnbroker's death.
Judge:
The incident occurred at one hour after midnight. But this indicates that a separate shot had been fired sometime after the calendar had been set to the 16th!
Ryunosuke:
That's right. And while it isn't irrefutable, the defence believes... ...this is credible evidence that the witnesses did fire a round from their gun in the pawnbroker's that night!
Nash:
NAAAAAAAAAH!!!
Judge:
Ordaaar! ...How does the prosecution stand, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
......... If that is the direction my learned friend wishes to take, the prosecution has no objection.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Van Zieks:
But you'll forgive me for flinging my hallowed chalice aside in disgust at the repugnancy it exposes. Yes. On the night in question, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery illegally... ...and like the bold 'baddies' they claim to be, opened fire on the new arrivals before fleeing back onto the street!
Nash:
EEEEEEH?! Take it easy there, guvnor! Yer gonna land us in the soup!
Ringo:
We 'ad a deal! You weren't gonna get into them...details. Tell 'im, Sulky! Set the bloke straight!
Gregson:
...I have nothin' to add.
Ryunosuke:
(So he knew, did he? Van Zieks knew their testimony would almost certainly expose the extent of their crimes.)
Van Zieks:
It would seem now... ...that I owe my learned Nipponese friend a word of gratitude. 
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Van Zieks:
What I mean...is that you have helpfully confirmed an important fact. 
Judge:
To what fact do you refer, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
As has been established, at the point of their arrest, a single shot had been fired from the brothers' gun. However, if that shot found its target in Mr Sholmes... ...then clearly these witnesses cannot be accused of the fatal shooting of the proprietor and victim.
Ryunosuke:
Agh!
Van Zieks:
In other words...these two men... ...have no material connection to the murder of Mr Windibank at all!
Ryunosuke:
...! (So that's it...)
Nash:
That's it! We didn't 'ave nuffin' to do wiv it!
Ringo:
We didn't, Nash, we didn't! That's wot I reckon!
Van Zieks:
Your crimes include unlawful entry, intent to steal, perjury and - let us not forget - attempted murder.
Gregson:
Quite a catalogue, eh, fellas?
Nash:
Ah...
Ringo:
We're in for it now, bruv...
Van Zieks:
Now then... ...let us take a moment to consider the aforementioned 'great detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes. It would seem the man patronised the pawnbroker's in question somewhat regularly.
Ryunosuke:
(Where's he going with this?)
Van Zieks:
Mr Sholmes appears to take pleasure in tinkering with eccentric machinery.
Iris:
'Eccentric'? Says who?!
Ryunosuke:
...Not me. Don't give me that look!
Van Zieks:
He installed a pair of machines like this one in the victim's shop.
Iris:
Oh! That's one of Hurley's 'Red-Handed Recorders'!
Judge:
What is that, Counsel? It has the appearance of a photographic contraption.
Van Zieks:
As Your Lordship has surmised, it is indeed a camera attached to a small timing device.
Ryunosuke:
Every half an hour, it automatically photographs the interior of the establishment. The idea being that if a thief were to break in to the shop, he would be caught red-handed.
Judge:
Hmmm...
Van Zieks:
The prosecution has obtained the photographs taken by the device on the night in question. As the court will observe, copious identical prints are produced in a quite desultory fashion.
Judge:
Hmph, rather prodigal, I feel.
Van Zieks:
In fact there are two such devices in the victim's shop, My Lord. If I may refer the court to the plan of the premises, their respective positions are here...and here.
Judge:
You say these cameras produce a print every half hour. I'm afraid I fail to see... ...how that would help if the anticipated thief conducted his activities in one of the many thirty-minute intervals.
Van Zieks:
One can only pray that the would-be criminal lingers, My Lord.
Judge:
Hmmm...
Van Zieks:
On the night in question, the witnesses currently in the stand were not caught on camera.
Nash:
Hehe, that's a bit o' Friar Tuck, eh, bruv?
Ringo:
Lady Luck luvs a Skulkin!
Judge:
Witnesses, at what time did your trespassing begin?
Nash:
Eh? ...Must've been just after one. ...Right, bruv?
Ringo:
Must've been, Nash, must've been. Yeah, just gone one.
Van Zieks:
In which case, minutes before these brothers entered the establishment... ...what scene might we expect to see within the shop? Let us examine the evidence...
Judge:
Good Lord! It's...it's the defendant! Miss Gina Lestrade!
Van Zieks:
As the court can clearly see... ...the accused is pictured, gun in hand, facing the victim over the shop counter. No doubt coercing the proprietor to open the door to his storeroom.
Judge:
Quite! One can only too easily imagine the events that unfolded. The court will take this photographic print as evidence, if you please, Counsel.
The photograph of Gina has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Iris:
I, I don't believe it! Ginny...
Van Zieks:
In short... ...the accused is the only person who could possibly have killed Mr Windibank.
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
???:
I say, My Lord...
Juror No. 1:
Wonder if I might put in a word at this point.
Judge:
Go ahead, Mr Foreman.
Juror No. 1:
Took a bally bullet to the knee in the Battle of Maiwand, 1880, don't you know. Decorated for it and all that, but forced to retire from service, sadly. 'Course, a medal can never outshine the exploits of chaps like us on the battlefield.
Judge:
Yes, Mr Foreman, and...? What exactly is your point?
Juror No. 1:
Carried on the battle after retirement, you see. The battle of daily life, if you like. And here I am now, leading this small squadron. Six men, all good and true. And we'll all go down together, you mark my words! One for all...and all for one!
Van Zieks:
...The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have reached agreement, have they? Is that what we are to understand?
Judge:
Well, Mr Foreman? Is that correct?
Juror No. 1:
......... In a manner of speaking...yes. That is the Garrideb Squadron's position, sir!
Ryunosuke:
What?! No! It's too soon to make a judgement here!
Juror No. 1:

Juror No. 2:
His Lordship insists on promptitude at all times. And that goes for making decisions, too.
Juror No. 3:

Juror No. 4:
I wouldn't have left it in there. I just wouldn't. But in all honesty, I can't actually remember...
Juror No. 5:
Situation clear. Stop. No room for doubt. Stop. Truth now undeniable. Stop.
Juror No. 6:
I am wery sorry for brothers. They are unlucky.
Judge:
Very well... ...I now call upon each member of the jury to state his or her leaning in this matter. Announce your considered verdicts to the court!
Juror No. 1:
Guilty!
Juror No. 2:
Guilty!
Juror No. 3:
Guilty!
Juror No. 4:
Guilty!
Juror No. 5:
Guilty!
Juror No. 6:
Guilty!
Judge:
It does indeed appear that the jury is unanimous in its leaning already.
Ryunosuke:
(That photograph... It must be the definitive evidence that Gregson mentioned!)
Iris:
But Ginny didn't shoot him!
Ryunosuke:
No, of course not! My Lord! The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination!
Judge:
Very well. The court grants permission.
Van Zieks:
So...you refuse to admit defeat again. How...unsurprising.
Judge:
We shall proceed immediately with the summation examination. Mr Foreman, are all members of the jury ready?
Juror No. 1:
Abso-bally-lutely, sir! Always ready for action, my chaps!
Judge:
...Very good. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have determined the defendant to be guilty!

Juror No. 3:

Juror No. 4:

Juror No. 5:
Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.
Juror No. 6:
In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.
Judge:
Hmmm... The circumstance of the crime and the evidence do indeed implicate the defendant rather comprehensively.
Van Zieks:
The storeroom, locked from the inside, in which the victim and the accused were discovered alone. And in the accused's hand, the fatal revolver, the firing of which was heard by these witnesses.
Juror No. 1:
Not to mention this print! Take it from a chap whose [sic] seen action on the battlefield: That young girl's on the verge of pulling the bally trigger!
Ryunosuke:
(...Thanks a lot, Mr Sholmes.)
Iris:
Oh dear... Hurley's cameras were supposed to help, not hinder.
Judge:
I'm afraid I think you have an uphill struggle ahead of you.
Ryunosuke:
(But Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank. Which means there's more to this situation that we've yet to see.)
Iris:
Agreed!
Judge:
You have the floor, Counsel. Proceed with the summation examination!

Juror No. 1:

Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Juror No. 1:
Haven't had the heart to break the news to Joanie yet. Bad enough that the old girl's clapped up. Yes, can't be denied...you did do rather a lot. But not for us, that's for dashed certain.

Um, what exactly do you mean by 'filthy eyesores'?
Juror No. 2:
On my way to market for His Lordship, I have to pass through the East End. The place is full of beggars, pickpurses and crossmen. The scum of the earth!
Ryunosuke:
...A little harsh, perhaps.
Juror No. 2:
Let me be plain... If it were up to me, all those back slums would be made spick and span or eradicated. At least we have people like the great detective working to achieve these important goals.
Ryunosuke:
You're referring to Mr Herlock Sholmes?
Juror No. 2:
That's right. I like to keep abreast of his exploits by reading Randst Magazine in between my duties. He does wonders, cleaning up London's streets. In my opinion, he should be declared an honorary maid of the capital.
Ryunosuke:
...Mr Sholmes? ...A maid?
Juror No. 2:
It's really quite unforgivable... Gutter scum having the audacity to shoot our very greatest detective!
Ryunosuke:
......... Minor detail: It was the two brothers in the stand who shot Mr Sholmes, not the defendant.
Juror No. 2:
A minor detail indeed. They're all gutter scum as far as I'm concerned!
Ryunosuke:
Weeell...it just might be an idea to get our facts straight anyway...
Juror No. 2:
...Yes, alright. I shall amend my statement.

Ryunosuke:

I agree with you. The shooting of Mr Sholmes was an unforgivable act. But the purpose of this trial is to determine who shot the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank.
Juror No. 2:
...I'm afraid you're splitting hairs, sir.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Juror No. 2:
Whether it was the thieves or the pickpurse... ...it was still gutter trash that shot the pawnbroker in the end. Filth that should be cleaned up and eradicated...in my considered opinion.
Ryunosuke:
(Thanks so much for sharing. ...Changing this maid's mind isn't going to be easy.)
Iris:
Runo... ...it was one of those two brothers that shot Hurley, wasn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Without question.
Iris:
Well then I'll never forgive them!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, Iris...
Iris:
Perhaps we can use this maid's statement to help us somehow, do you think?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, maybe. Let's listen carefully to what each juror has to say first...
Pit against Juror No. 6's statement
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Those two statements clearly contradict each other!
Judge:
Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself!
Juror No.2:
Oh my! My statement? Contradictory?
Juror No. 6:
Contradict... C-o-n...
Ryunosuke:
Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick.
Juror No. 6:
...I do not have stick. I have mouse.
Ryunosuke:
As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver.
Juror No. 2:
Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand!
Ryunosuke:
...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear?
Juror No. 6:
......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d...
Ryunosuke:
...Sir?
Juror No. 6:
Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning.
Ryunosuke:
...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear?
Juror No. 6:
......... Forgive me. I did not hear.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Juror No. 6:
...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker.
Ryunosuke:
(...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!)
Juror No. 6:
So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative.
Ryunosuke:
Yes! That's exactly right!
Juror No. 6:
Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal!
Ryunosuke:
...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced.
Juror No. 6:
This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?!
Ryunosuke:
Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so...
Juror No. 6:
Enough! I trust no one now!
Ryunosuke:
...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir.
Juror No. 6:
I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself!
Ryunosuke:
I'm afraid that won't be poss-
Iris:
Yes it is, Runo! Easily!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Iris:
With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder!
Ryunosuke:
Ah...
Iris:
If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor!
Van Zieks:
Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight.
Iris:
So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken.
Ryunosuke:
(That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.)
Juror No. 6:
So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing.
Ryunosuke:
It would seem so, yes.
Juror No. 6:
Good.
Ryunosuke:
No, not good.
Juror No. 6:
You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial.
Iris:
Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting!
Ryunosuke:
Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still!
Judge:
Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence.
The post-shooting photograph has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
(Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...)
Changes Juror No. 6's statement to "In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict."

Sorry? What? Don't, don't you know? If you look at the photographic print normally... ...it looks as though the pickpocket girl is about to shoot the victim, obviously.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But there's no indication that the defendant ever fired the gun!
Juror No. 3:
All I'm saying is that if you look at the same print in stereo, it could reveal all sorts of new information.
Ryunosuke:
......... By any chance... ...are you a fan of stereoscopes?
Juror No. 3:
Ooooooh! How did you know?!
Ryunosuke:

Juror No. 3:
Oh yes! I think you'll find that the stereoscope is here to stay! Giving us new perspectives we could only dream of before, it's the greatest invention the world has ever seen!

What?
Iris:
You need two photographs for a stereoscope, remember? You know, one for the left eye, and one for the right.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, oh yes. I remember now. But the print we have from the pawnbrokery is just a normal photograph.
Juror No. 3:
No no no. I think you'll find... ...that the clue is in the name. It's a stereoscope, not a monoscope! You always need two prints!
Ryunosuke:

Hmmm... Well, if we obtain another print at some point later in the trial... ...we can always show it to this young man then.

Juror No. 4:
Ah well, that's...a little embarrassing, to be honest. You see I was operating on someone yesterday. Standard thing - went in through the abdomen. But when I'd finished the procedure, I... Well, I couldn't find my scalpel anywhere.
Ryunosuke:
What?! (Did he...? Surely not!)
Juror No. 4:
Exactly! 'Surely not!' you say to yourself, don't you? Worrying, isn't it? That's what's been troubling me this whole time. Could I really have left my scalpel inside the fellow's belly? ...No, of course I couldn't! So...there you have it. Like I said, a little embarrassing, really.

That's exactly my concern! And seeing as this case appears to be all but sewn up... ...I need to focus on trying to remember exactly what I've sewn up elsewhere! Now...I'm sure I made sure everything was back as it should be. Well, as sure as you can be without being sure.
Ryunosuke:
(...I'm sure you need to be more sure.)
Juror No. 5:
Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry, 'radio transmission'? What do you mean?
Juror No. 5:
...Are you from the Far East? Stop.
Ryunosuke:
Um, yes. From the Empire of Japan.
Juror No. 5:
All communication with Far Eastern nations used to take place by mail. Royal Mail steamers take more than a month to complete the journey.
Iris:
Ah, but now we have the electric telegram. So we can send messages using electrical signals. Thousands of miles of cables have been laid along the ocean beds, connecting the entire world.
Ryunosuke:
Thousands of miles of cable? ...On the ocean bed? (It makes my head hurt just thinking about it.)
Juror No. 5:
You are well informed, young lady.
Iris:
Hehe!
Juror No. 5:
But cables will soon become a thing of the past. Stop.
Ryunosuke:
...And just when I was starting to catch up.
Juror No. 5:
Radio transmission is the future. Stop. Messages carried over airwaves to four corners of globe. Stop. Excitement growing! Stop. Atmosphere electric! Stop.
Ryunosuke:
Right... (...Try not to wear out your fingers.)
Juror No. 5:
Era of wireless telegraphy! Stop. Driving technological revolution! Stop. And people say inventions like the stereoscope are the height of technology! What utter piffle! I can't understand it. I really can't. They're just silly toys!
Pursue Juror No. 3
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Erm, juror number three...sorry to interrupt when you're obviously fuming, but...
Juror No. 3:
What?!
Ryunosuke:
Do you perhaps have something to say about juror number five's last remark? ...As if I couldn't guess.
Juror No. 3:
Oh, you bet I do! Say that again! Go on! I dare you!
Juror No. 5:
Goodness! Are you talking to me?
Ryunosuke:
...I think he just might be, yes.
Juror No. 3:
You think stereoscopes are just toys, do you? Huh?
Juror No. 5:
Absolutely. I mean, really! A machine to view photographs in three dimensions? Why on earth would you not just use your eyes to look at the world around you? It's all three-dimensional!
Ryunosuke:
...What a great way to appease the man.
Juror No. 5:
No, I'm sorry. Stereoscopes are of no practical use at all.
Juror No. 3:
......... You just don't know!
Juror No. 5:
Pardon?
Juror No. 3:
I think you'll find that viewing a photograph through a stereoscope... ...can unlock all sorts of possibilities! I'm obviously going to have to demonstrate!
Ryunosuke:
What sort of possibilities?
Juror No. 3:
Well, take a crime scene, for example. If you had a pair of photographs from a crime scene that you could view through a stereoscope... ...it could reveal hidden clues you'd never even noticed before!
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Iris:
Have you got any, Runo? Any prints we could look at with a stereoscope?
Absolutely! [before Juror No. 6 votes innocent]
Ryunosuke:
How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think.
Present Photograph of Gina
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Alright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints?
Juror No. 3:
Of course I can!
Ryunosuke:
Very well then...I'd like you to demonstrate.
Juror No. 3:
I'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all!
Present anything
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Wait, sorry? What do you mean, one more print?
Juror No. 3:
Oh dear, oh dear... Don't you have these in the Far East? Don't you know how a stereoscope works?
Iris:
Runo!
Ryunosuke:
What?
Iris:
You need two photographs for a stereoscope, remember? You know, one for the left eye, and one for the right.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, oh yes. I remember now. But the print we have from the pawnbrokery is just a normal photograph.
Juror No. 3:
No no no. I think you'll find... ...that the clue is in the name. It's a stereoscope, not a monoscope! You always need two prints!
Ryunosuke:
(...Thanks for the friendly explanation.)
Iris:
Hmmm... Well, if we obtain another print at some point later in the trial... ...we can always show it to this young man then.
Juror No. 3:
Hahaha!
Ryunosuke:
(I think you'll find...that know-it-all expression is really starting to annoy me.)
Judge:
Let's get things back on track, shall we, Counsel?
Changes Juror No. 3's statement to "All we'd need is another shot from a slightly different location, and we could see the scene in three dimensions!"
Leads back to summation examination
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...I was wrong. I can't actually think of anything we could use at all.
Iris:
What? Really? Oh dear, I think maybe I need to have a stereoscopic look at your brain sometime.
Ryunosuke:
(...What's that supposed to mean?)
Leads back to summation examination
Absolutely! [after Juror No. 6 votes innocent]
Ryunosuke:
How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think.
Present Photograph of Gina or Post-Shooting Photograph

Ryunosuke:
Alright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints?

Juror No. 3:
I'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all!
Present Post-Shooting Photograph or Photograph of Gina (whichever has not been presented yet)

Ryunosuke:
Wait, sorry? What do you mean, one more print?
Juror No. 3:
Oh dear, oh dear... Don't you have these in the Far East? Don't you know how a stereoscope works?

Ryunosuke:
(...What's that supposed to mean?)
Leads back to summation examination
None spring to mind
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...no, I don't think so. None spring to mind, anyway.
Iris:
Well if you find any, we should definitely try it!
Ryunosuke:
...I don't think we're just going to find prints of the crime scene lying around, you know. (But I suppose if we somehow find ourselves with some, it would be worth a go...)
Leads back to summation examination
Ryunosuke:
...Don't spare any feelings, will you? It's not like there's anyone here who likes stereoscopes... So...why exactly do you think that the defendant is guilty?
Juror No. 5:
It's quite simple... We haven't been shown a scrap of evidence to suggest that she isn't the culprit. And just as radio waves dash through the skies faster than the eye can see... ...so we should dash to the conclusion of this trial, and stop pandering to in-dit-cision!
Juror No. 6:
In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Please tell me you're not Vilen Borshevik... ...the Russian revolutionary.
Juror No. 5:
Re-Revolutionary?!
Juror No. 6:
......... Da. I believe there is such a rumour.
Ryunosuke:
...It's just a rumour?
Juror No. 6:
As you see, I have unfortunate appearance. I look like wicious criminal.
Ryunosuke:
(...Your words, not mine. Just want to point that out.)
Juror No. 6:
People call me revolutionary...murderer...autocrat...
Juror No. 5:
And...which glove fits?
Juror No. 6:
'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.'
Juror No. 5:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Right. That didn't sound staged at all. You'll forgive me for having my doubts.)
Juror No. 6:
To be treated like wicious criminal all the time... It is wery painful. People do not realise. So I have much sympathies for these brothers. People say they are criminals only because of how they look.
Ryunosuke:
The Skulkin brothers?
Juror No. 6:
Da, maybe they went inside pawnbroker's shop. But they have done nothing wrong. That is all what I want to say!
Ryunosuke:
...The Skulkin brothers did nothing wrong that night? (Alright, well first of all... ...that's one not-so-little misunderstanding I'll need to clear up straight away.) Tell me something, Iris...
Iris:
Hm? What is it, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
The jurors are chosen at random from the inhabitants of London town, aren't they?
Iris:
Yes! It's amazing, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
In that case... ...how is it that there's a Russian tourist sitting among them, who looks for all the world like a revolutionary?
Iris:
...I wish I knew.
Pit against Juror No. 2's statement (after Juror No. 2 changes her statement)
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Those two statements clearly contradict each other!
Judge:
Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself!
Juror No.2:
Oh my! My statement? Contradictory?
Juror No. 6:
Contradict... C-o-n...
Ryunosuke:
Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick.
Juror No. 6:
...I do not have stick. I have mouse.
Ryunosuke:
As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver.
Juror No. 2:
Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand!
Ryunosuke:
...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear?
Juror No. 6:
......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d...
Ryunosuke:
...Sir?
Juror No. 6:
Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning.
Ryunosuke:
...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear?
Juror No. 6:
......... Forgive me. I did not hear.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Juror No. 6:
...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker.
Ryunosuke:
(...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!)
Juror No. 6:
So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative.
Ryunosuke:
Yes! That's exactly right!
Juror No. 6:
Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal!
Ryunosuke:
...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced.
Juror No. 6:
This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?!
Ryunosuke:
Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so...
Juror No. 6:
Enough! I trust no one now!
Ryunosuke:
...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir.
Juror No. 6:
I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself!
Ryunosuke:
I'm afraid that won't be poss-
Iris:
Yes it is, Runo! Easily!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Iris:
With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder!
Ryunosuke:
Ah...
Iris:
If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor!
Van Zieks:
Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight.
Iris:
So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken.
Ryunosuke:
(That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.)
Juror No. 6:
So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing.
Ryunosuke:
It would seem so, yes.
Juror No. 6:
Good.
Ryunosuke:
No, not good.
Juror No. 6:
You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial.
Iris:
Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting!
Ryunosuke:
Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still!
Judge:
Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence.
The post-shooting photograph has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
(Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...)
Changes Juror No. 6's statement to "In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict."
Juror No. 6:
In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.
Ryunosuke:
(If I can't change the minds of more than half of these six jurors... ...the trial will be over.)
Iris:
But we know that Ginny would never shoot anyone.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, so we need to find contradictions in what these jurors are saying and pit them against each other. (I must be ready to go to whatever lengths I have to... to convince them of Gina's innocence!)
Ryunosuke:
Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.
Juror No. 3:
Yes, I see. Tell me, Mr, um...lawyer. Do you know how stereographic images work? Do you understand the principle?
Ryunosuke:
Well...I think so... (I did have a lesson only yesterday...) The left and right eye images need to be the same, only with a slight shift in the positions of some objects. Then when your brain merges the two images together inside your head, it notices the shift as if it were depth.
Juror No. 3:
Yes, exactly.
Iris:
It's that small shift between certain objects in the two pictures that's really important.
Ryunosuke:
So what happens if you use two photographs that are exactly the same, then?
Juror No. 3:
No no, obviously that wouldn't work at all. Not for seeing the scene three-dimensionally, anyway.
Iris:
Oh... OOOOOOH! Of course! Now I see!
Juror No. 3:
Ah! I think the young girl has discovered the secret!
Iris:
I have, I have!
Ryunosuke:
...Can you uncross your eyes before you tell me?
Iris:
Have another look at these two pictures from Hurley's camera, Runo! Go on! Can you see that there's a really obvious difference between them?
Ryunosuke:
Of course there is! There are two people in the first, and no people in the second!
Iris:
Well yes, you can see that straight away. But now... ...try looking at the pictures in three dimensions!
Ryunosuke:
Alright, I'll, I'll give it a go. (So, to start with... ...you have to cross your eyes, and then try to make the two pictures overlap exactly.) ........................... (Let's see if by crossing my eyes I can make the quill pens from each picture overlap in the middle...) ........................... (...Wait...)
Iris:
Well? Did you manage to see it properly, Runo?
Not really...
Ryunosuke:
I'm just not very good at this, that's the trouble.
Iris:
Oh, don't worry. I have just the thing! I happened to bring with me...a portable stereoscope!
Ryunosuke:
......... I know I mentioned this yesterday, but if you've had that contraption with you from the outset... ...you could have saved me staring at Mr Windibank and Gina like I hate them all that time!
Iris:
And if you remember, I said in reply... ...that it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Anyway, why don't we try using this helpful little aid now? Here goes...
Ryunosuke:
........................... (Now, let's see what we've got... ...Wait! Look at that!) 
Leads to:
"Agh!"
Yes, I saw it!
Leads to:
"Agh!"
Ryunosuke:
Agh! What's, what's going on with these two pictures? Some of the things on the counter sort of... They sort of jump out at you!
Juror No. 3:
Yes yes yes! That's it, you see! That's the other amazing power of stereoscopes!
Ryunosuke:
O-Other amazing power?!
Juror No. 1:
Is someone going to explain this...black magic, eh? Why the deuce do some of the things on the counter seem to jump out at you like that, hm?
Juror No. 3:
I think you'll find that if you consider the basic principle of the stereoscope, you'll answer your own question.
Juror No. 5:
Basic principles...of the stereoscope...?
Juror No. 3:
As I said before... ...if you try to look at two identical pictures using a stereoscope, it won't work at all. It's the slight shift in the positions of certain objects that lets you see pictures three-dimensionally.
Ryunosuke:
...In other words... ...even though at first glance it seems the objects on the counter haven't moved at all between the two pictures... ...this shows that actually...there must have been a slight shift in their positions!
Iris:
Yes, there must have been.
Juror No. 1:
Now hold fire there, sir! Got a reasonable grasp of this whole cross-eyed business now, I'd say. But why the devil does this shift between the two prints exist in the first place? Well? What's the answer, fellow? Come on, you're the cross-eyed master!
Ryunosuke:
What? Me? (I haven't the first idea!)
Iris:
You know, Runo! It's quite simple.
Ryunosuke:
It, it is?
Iris:
Just think it through step by step. The first photograph was taken at 1:00 a.m. Then, thirty minutes later...the second photograph was taken. But the position of some items on the counter appears to have shifted slightly in the interim. So that means...?
Ryunosuke:
That means that sometime in the half hour interval... ...someone must have tampered with the things on the counter!
Juror No. 1:
Zookers!
Juror No. 3:
Someone tampered...?
Juror No. 5:
New information! Stop. Not mentioned in testimony so far! Stop.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes... ...we've had to go around in circles a little here, it seems... ...but I'm starting to see what I should be aiming at in this summation examination now.) Ladies and gentlemen! The question now is clear. We know the items on the countertop were moved. ...But by whom?
Juror No. 1:
Are you... Are you suggesting you might know?
Ryunosuke:
Of course. I can tell you right now who is responsible for the almost imperceptible shift in the items on the counter!
Present Nash Skulkin or Ringo Skulkin profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!"
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Quite clearly it was the work...of this meddler!
Judge:
Hm... I'm afraid you've digressed there, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Van Zieks:
It should now be clear even to you... ...who is responsible for the impeachable shift in the direction of this trial...toward the absurd.
Ryunosuke:
Let me guess... ...Me?
Van Zieks:
Shift aside, my Nipponese friend, and let the real lawyers do the talking!
Ryunosuke:
Uargh! (I really felt that one...)
Iris:
If you think about it... ...it has to have been someone who was in Windibank's when everything was going on, doesn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Well...yes, that's true.
Iris:
So... ...that narrows it down quite a lot, I think.
Ryunosuke:
I'll have another think! (We know somebody must have touched the things on Mr Windibank's counter. So who was it?)
Leads back to:
"Ladies and gentlemen!"
Ryunosuke:
It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!
Juror No. 2:
...!
Juror No. 4:
...!
Juror No. 6:
Wait! This does not agree with what brothers said in testimony before. They said they did not even have time to pull 'dukes' from 'Lucy Lockets'. My phrasebook says 'dukes' is meaning 'hands' and 'Lucy Lockets' is meaning 'pockets'. But is this...another lie?! Is this what you are saying?!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Juror No. 4:
Now hold on there a minute! You can't be sure of that.
Juror No. 2:
I quite agree. The accused is a common pickpurse, after all. It's perfectly possible that she went through the things on the desk to see what she might steal.
Ryunosuke:
I think...that's unlikely.
Juror No. 1:
And why, exactly?
Ryunosuke:
...As you can see from...this photographic print, the defendant was pointing a gun at the victim. It would seem, as my learned friend indicated, that she was coercing Mr Windibank to open the storeroom door. In other words, Miss Lestrade's interests lay within the storeroom, not in the main shop... ...giving her no reason to touch anything on the counter. All of which points to one thing! The Skulkin brothers have omitted key facts in their testimony!
Juror No. 1:
...!
Juror No. 2:
...! But the accused is a pickpurse! Common gutter trash! Why look any further for the wrongdoer here?
Ryunosuke:
Because the Skulkin brothers are thieves, madam. No better - in fact worse - than a pickpurse.
Juror No. 2:
...!
Ryunosuke:
I believe that these brothers were looking for something on the victim's counter that night.
Juror No. 3:
...!
Juror No. 4:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you would condemn the defendant on the grounds that she's a pickpocket... ...would it not at least be right and proper to thoroughly scrutinise testimony given against her by two thieves?
Juror No. 4:
...Well said.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Juror No. 4:
I for one would like to hear more from that shady pair!
Juror No. 3:
Can you all see now? I think you'll find stereoscopes aren't playthings! You've seen their extraordinary potential firsthand!
Juror No. 5:
Wholeheartedly agree! Stop. Must purchase after trial. Stop. Will return home via Regent Street. Stop.
Judge:
Well...it would seem this trial has yet to run its course. The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have declared their inclinations via the mighty Scales of Justice. I hereby call this summation examination to conclusion with the balance altered in the defendant's favour. Two lean to guilty. Four lean to not guilty. Accordingly, the jury is without consensus... ...and I order this trial to continue.
Iris:
Yay! Well done! ...Oh, by the way...
Ryunosuke:
What?
Iris:
You should hold onto this, Runo. You never know when it might come in useful!
Ryunosuke:
(Twice in one trial would be unusual, surely? But alright.)
The stereoscope has been entered into the Court Record.
Judge:
Lord van Zieks... ...you will instruct the witnesses that the court demands additional testimony from them.
Examine evidence
Stereoscope
Print tray
Iris:
You have to pop your two prints in here to start with, you see.
Ryunosuke:
And then, when you look through the eyepieces, you can see the image in three dimensions!
Iris:
The important thing to get right is the position of the two prints.
Ryunosuke:
(I don't know who came up with the idea of a stereoscope, but it's really quite fascinating.)
Button
Ryunosuke:
Ooh! Look at that! It's totally changed shape, just from one little button press!
Iris:
Well, that is what the button's for, Runo. You're just like Hurley. You boys love pressing buttons, don't you, especially if you don't know what they do!
Ryunosuke:
(Us boys? ...Says the ten-year-old girl.)
Iris:
Anyway, now you can see that it really is a stereoscope, can't you?
Van Zieks:
......... I'm sure it won't spoil the bouquet to do so...My Lord.
Ryunosuke:
(I've won myself another chance to probe that pair about their activities that night at least. And I won't stop probing them until I've proven that Gina is innocent!)
To be continued...
Judge:
Order, please. Let us resume proceedings. Witnesses! You will now retake the stand.
Judge:
I presume you heard the defence counsel's summation examination?
Nash:
Oh...yeah...guvnor.
Ringo:
I did, guv, I did.
Ryunosuke:
...Mr and Mr Skulkin!
Cor!
Blimey!
Ryunosuke:
(...This is going to be hard work.) Earlier in this trial, you gave the following testimony about your actions after you entered Windibank's...
Nash:
Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?
Ringo:
It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.
Ryunosuke:
However...that was a lie! You brothers!
Cor!
Blimey!
Ryunosuke:
On the night in question... ...you rifled through the items on the victim's counter!
We never done nuffin' o' the sort!
'Ow d'you figure that out?
.........
Judge:
You will now give formal testimony once again. You will tell the court precisely what happened on the night in question. And this time...you will tell the truth.
Van Zieks:
...Each lie that passes your lips serves to increase the severity of your punishment. And that, gentlemen, may deal a crushing blow to your chances of ever seeing the light of day again.
...!
...!
Van Zieks:
A thought worth pondering perhaps.
Say no more, guv! We 'ear ya!
We'll blab! We'll speak! We'll peach!
Witness Testimony
- Illegal Entry: The Whole Truth -
Nash:
Alright, we did knock a few things over. But we weren't riflin' fer nuffin'!
Ringo:
It woz when we 'eard the gunshot, see. Made us both jump, an' all that stuff went flyin'.
Nash:
Lummy, it didn't 'alf gimme a fright! We woz thinkin' the shooter'd come out the door and get us next.
Ringo:
We stuck everyfin' back where we found it and scarpered...straight into 'im in the black.
Nash:
We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?
Judge:
Hmmm...so you admit to the defence's accusation. You did indeed ransack Mr Windibank's countertop on the night in question.
Nash:
Err...not ransack, guvnor, no.
Ringo:
That's right, Nash, that's right. It's...more like we tidied up. Yeah.
Van Zieks:
.........
Ringo:
Ugh...sorry.
Van Zieks:
By their own admission, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery under dubious circumstances. However, they panicked and fled on hearing the gunshot, having first made good their mess.
Nash:
The way you say it...we 'ardly sound like roughs at all.
Ringo:
We don't, Nash, we don't. Can't 'e make us sound a bit more...cut-throat?
Ryunosuke:
(It can't just be coincidence that these men showed up at Windibank's that night. There's more to their testimony than meets the eye. I'm sure of it!)
Cross-Examination
- Illegal Entry: The Whole Truth -
Nash:
Alright, we did knock a few things over. But we weren't riflin' fer nuffin'!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
If that's the case, then why didn't you testify to that effect in the first place?
Nash:
Well, ya know... We ain't exactly squeaky clean, are we?
Ringo:
We ain't, Nash, we ain't! If we admitted to somefin' like that, people would think we woz up to no good!
Nash:
Well said, Ringo, me old china! We'd only land ourselves in even more trouble!
Ryunosuke:
And in fact now, as a result of lying in your previous testimony... ...that's exactly what you've done. Landed yourselves in even more trouble.
Nash:
Ah, well, erm...
Ringo:
That's rotten luck.
Ryunosuke:
(...Says the rotten apple-eater.)
Van Zieks:
Witnesses... ...explain your actions to the court. Why did you ransack the victim's counter?
Nash:
We never ransacked nuffin'!
Ringo:
Right, Nash, right! More like we tidied the place up.
Van Zieks:
.........
Ringo:
Ugh...sorry...
Ringo:
It woz when we 'eard the gunshot, see. Made us both jump, an' all that stuff went flyin'.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So what you're saying is... ...the sound of the gunshot shocked you so much, you knocked all those things off the counter?
Nash:
Well, it shocked one of us that much, yeah! This bag o' nerves needs to learn to keep 'is shirt on!
Ringo:
Look, it woz loud, alright? Blimey, me dead granny would 'ave woken up at that bang!
Nash:
'Big' bruv 'ere screamed like a bloomin' baby and fell over on the counter. 'E knocked over a load o' books, a candlestick and some skull wotnot.
Ringo:
That got tangled in some marionette, wot knocked over a picture frame, wot knocked them scales on the floor.
Ryunosuke:
...You've really mastered working quietly then.
Ringo:
Wot a racket! Me granny would 'ave been scared back into 'er grave at a clatter like that.
Ryunosuke:
So in short...the gunshot took you by surprise.
Nash:
And then some! I mean it woz quiet as a mouse an' then all of a sudden...BAM!
Pursue Tobias Gregson
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Inspector Gregson! Do you have something to add?
Gregson:
Like I keep sayin', I don't appreciate bein' lumped in with these scoundrels!
Ryunosuke:
......... No, something to add about their testimony? You seemed to react just now at what Mr Skulkin said. Did it make you think of something?
Gregson:
......... It's probably nothin', of course. I wouldn't even bother to mention it, only... Well, the fact is, cases don't get solved if you ignore the little details.
Ryunosuke:
...How about you just tell us what's on your mind?
Gregson:
......... As you know, we brought these fellas in to the Yard for questionin' last night. And the statement they gave then told a slightly different story to what they're sayin' now.
Nash:
...!
Ringo:
...!
Nash:
Ah...um... Did it?
Gregson:
You claimed you heard the victim shout somethin' out before the gunshot.
Ringo:
Might 'ave, guv, might 'ave. Does ring a bell, now ya mention it...
Gregson:
Granted, it's only a minor detail, but still... ...I can't help feelin' like perhaps you've been a bit sloppy with your testimony here, eh, fellas?
Judge:
If I discover the witnesses' testimony has been any more 'sloppy' than it has hitherto proven to be... ...I shall be forced to bring the very harshest punishment to bear against them.
Nash:
Easy, easy!
Ringo:
We'll get it right this time!
Nash:
That's it! Yep! It's all comin' back to me now!
Van Zieks:
Then speak! Supplement your testimony with whatever details have miraculously returned to your questionable minds...sirs.
Ringo:
Um...hehe... Right you are...guv.
Changes statement from "It woz when we 'eard the gunshot, see. Made us both jump, an' all that stuff went flyin'." to "Just before the gunshot, we 'eard a voice yellin' out, 'Gimme that gun!'"
Adds statement "The bloke wot owned the place was 'oldin' a gun, so 'e should 'ave just fired instead of yellin' at the girl!"
Ringo:
And picture the scene, right. I 'ear the shot, then next thing I know, there's a skull rollin' across the floor!
Nash:
That deafenin' bang in the pitch-black... I ain't gonna forget that in an 'urry, I can tell ya.
Ryunosuke:
And yet despite being so scared, you had the composure to tidy the mess you'd made?
Nash:
Eh? Wot d'ya mean, guv?
Ryunosuke:
I would imagine most people would have left the rolling skull and fled without a second thought.
Ringo:
D'you wanna give the Skulkin bruvs a bad name? If nuffin' else, we're tidy!
Ryunosuke:
...Well pardon me for the slander.
Ringo:
Just before the gunshot, we 'eard a voice yellin' out, 'Gimme that gun!'
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So in fact you heard the voice and the gunshot almost simultaneously?
Ringo:
We did, guv, we did.
Nash:
Although...I s'pose if yer bein'...honest...we 'eard a kind of waverin' voice before the yell an' all.
Ringo:
'If, if ya don't wanna get shot...'
'Gimme that gun! BAM!'
Ringo:
...Kind o' thing!
Ryunosuke:
(...A career in acting tragically missed...) And where were the voices coming from? Could you tell?
Ringo:
'Course we could! From the other side o' that door behind the counter, it woz.
Ryunosuke:
(From the storeroom, where the victim was found dead...)
Van Zieks:
And the voice you heard...it was that of the victim, Mr Windibank?
Ringo:
On me granny's life! 'Course it woz!
Nash:
On 'is granny's life! 'Course it woz!
Ryunosuke:
So...that would mean... ...that you both knew Mr Windibank and the sound of his voice?
Nash:
Eh? So that would mean...wot?!
Ringo:
Wot, Nash, wot? ...Any ideas?
Judge:
Yes, Counsel, indeed it would.
Nash:
......... Nah nah nah! We, we didn't know the geezer!
Ringo:
'Ow am I s'posed to deny it when that bloke in all the fancy clobber's givin' us the evil eye?
Van Zieks:
......... If you value your lives, you will ensure your testimony is accurate and true.
Ringo:
On, on me granny's life, it is!
Nash:
On, on 'is granny's life, it must be!
Ryunosuke:
(...It's a good job his granny's dead.)
Van Zieks:
To summarise, then... Immediately after hearing the voice of the victim, you then hear the gunshot... ...causing you to stumble and upset the items on the counter, scattering them over the shop floor.
Ringo:
...Ya make it sound like we're clumsy.
Nash:
Don't forget we tidied up after like good little boys. Anyway, the way I see it...
Nash:
The bloke wot owned the place was 'oldin' a gun, so 'e should 'ave just fired instead of yellin' at the girl!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You're saying that Mr Windibank had a gun in his hands?
Nash:
Oh yeah! Bet that woz a sight, eh? Them two wavin' them guns at each other. Must've got pretty 'eated! I mean, just before 'e shouted out, we 'eard the geezer say, 'If ya don't wanna get shot...'!
Ringo:
Didn't really sound like 'e meant it, mind. More of an empty threat, ya could say.
Van Zieks:
Mr Windibank was known to keep a revolver on his shop counter at all times. People say that to protect the articles in his keeping, he'd readily put a bullet in someone's head if required. ...That someone being himself, of course.
Judge:
Good grief! Extraordinary devotion, indeed, if alarmingly misguided.
Nash:
Well 'e certainly sounded like 'e woz ready to pull the trigger the other night. Only, the person 'e woz gonna shoot beat 'im to it. Cooked 'is goose proper!
Ringo:
Bet 'e wished 'e'd squeezed the trigger instead of wastin' time shoutin', 'Gimme that gun!'
Ryunosuke:
And it was directly after those words that you heard the gunshot?
Nash:
It woz more or less at the same time, guv.
'Gimme that gun! BAM!'
Ringo:
...Kind o' thing!
Ryunosuke:
(...Yes... A career in acting very tragically missed...)
Nash:
Then we 'eard the sound o' someone hittin' the deck... ...before everyfin' went dead quiet.
Ringo:
After that, we dun a slap-dash job tidyin' the place up.

Present Photograph of Gina
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
You're saying that on the night in question... ...the victim, Mr Windibank, was wielding a gun, is that correct?
Nash:
That's it, guv. You've got the picture.
Ringo:
'E has, Nash, 'e has. No question!
Ryunosuke:
And yet the photographic evidence from the time of the incident clearly shows... ...that Mr Windibank was not in possession of a firearm of any description!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
...You surprise me. Does the defence really intend to highlight evidence that compromises the position of the accused even more?
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Judge:
Furthermore, the defence has failed to establish that the photographic print presented... ...was taken a suitably short time prior to the victim's death. Your chronology is severely lacking, Counsel.
Nash:
Yeah! That's right!
Ringo:
Too right, Nash, too right! The old geezer could've been about to turn the tables on the girl, eh?
Ryunosuke:
(...Hardly likely.)
Judge:
No, I'm afraid this won't stand as conclusive evidence.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Judge:
Continue with the cross-examination, Counsel! ...And heed my earlier warning, witnesses!
...A Skulkin's never skulkin'!
Nash:
Lummy, it didn't 'alf gimme a fright! We woz thinkin' the shooter'd come out the door and get us next.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So...you didn't try to open the storeroom door then?
Nash:
Not on yer life!
Ringo:
It went deathly quiet after that, it did. Put the wind right up me. But anyway, the door woz locked, weren't it? No way that woz openin'!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course. It was locked from the inside, or so we've been led to believe.
Ringo:
It woz, guv, it woz! From the inside.
Nash:
Right, so we 'ad no way of knowin' wot woz goin' on in there, did we?
Ryunosuke:
Unless there was some other way to get a view of the inside of the storeroom. Like, through the keyhole or...a spyhole perhaps?
Don't ring no bells! Don't light no lights!
We 'ad to cut an' run before we noticed anyfin' like that.
We're still cuttin' our teeth in this game, see. But one day...
...we'll really cut the mustard!
Ryunosuke:
...Please...cut it out.
Van Zieks:
But as we know, behind that door was the victim's lifeless body...with the accused not two feet away.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes...unfortunately... Gina was in there, unconscious...with the gun in her hand...)
Van Zieks:
To confirm, would it be correct to say that neither of you set foot inside the storeroom?
Ringo:
That's right, guv, that's right!
Nash:
Couldn't 'ave even if we'd wanted to!
Ringo:
We stuck everyfin' back where we found it and scarpered...straight into 'im in the black.

Ryunosuke:

Ryunosuke:
Yes, whereupon you fired a shot from your own gun... at Mr Herlock Sholmes!
Nash:
Oh, um...yeah...erm... We woz a bit 'asty there.
Ringo:
We woz, Nash, we woz! Troof be told, I woz already shakin' like a leaf when you lot turned up.
Iris:
If you're shaking like a leaf, don't put a loaded gun in your hand!
Ringo:
G-Good advice, miss, good advice...
Nash:
Troof be told, me mind went totally blank.
Iris:
Before your mind goes totally blank, make sure you don't have a loaded gun in your hand!
Nash:
M-Mental note made, miss...
Ringo:
After that we legged it down the street, but... ...'parently we looked dodgy to the coppers or summat, so they clapped the Darbies on us like winkin'.
Van Zieks:
And after you'd been handcuffed, the police found this revolver in your possession, correct?
Ringo:
Erm...well...yeah.
Nash:
But listen! That proves it, dunnit? Eh?
Nash:
We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
And why should we believe that?
Nash:
Eh? Wot? Well...cos it's true, innit!
Ringo:
The place was totally empty when we went in.
Van Zieks:
At that time, the victim was already in the storeroom... ...having been forced to open the door by the accused who had a gun to his head.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
In other words, on the night in question, these two witnesses... ...never even laid eyes on the proprietor of the pawnbrokery, Mr Windibank. Correct?
Ringo:
You've got it, mister!
Nash:
Down to a tee!
Judge:
Hmmm...
Ryunosuke:
(So the Skulkin brothers never actually encountered Mr Windibank? Is that really true, I wonder...)
Ryunosuke:
(That's it? That's the full extent of their testimony?)
Iris:
What is it, Runo? You look very fierce! I could pour you some herbal tea if you're tired?
Ryunosuke:
Oh...thank you, but I'm fine. Being such a logical thinker, you'll probably laugh... ...but I feel as though these brothers are still hiding something. Something important. It is nothing more than a feeling, though. I've no proof to support it.
Iris:
Hm... Well, feelings can be very logical at times.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Iris:
People's expressions...the movement of their eyes... the words they choose... You can take all that in and your brain will quietly analyse it to come up with a 'feeling' like you describe. You've concluded that there's something suspicious about this testimony without knowing why, that's all. I think you should trust your instincts.
Ryunosuke:
Iris...thank you... (...Sometimes I think if she's ten years old, I must be five.)
Ryunosuke:
So you're saying... ...that on the night in question, the victim, Mr Windibank, was wielding a gun, is that correct?
Nash:
That's it, guv. You've got the picture.
Ringo:
'E has, Nash, 'e has. No question!
Ryunosuke:
And yet...photographic evidence obtained immediately after the incident clearly shows... ...that Mr Windibank was not holding a firearm of any description!
Ringo:
Eh?! You wot?!
Nash:
Gordon Bennett! That ain't right!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
There can be no question that the victim's revolver was used in the incident. I would remind the court that Mr Windibank's gun was found at the scene. Not only was it identified as the murder weapon...but it was found in the accused's hand!
Nash:
Yeah! That moll-tooler used the victim's own gun to finish 'im off!
'Gimme that gun! BAM!'
Ringo:
...Kind o' thing!
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Stay exactly where you are! Right there!
Ringo:
Eh?
Ryunosuke:
If the crime had taken place as you've so colourfully described in your testimony... ...it would give rise to an undeniable and significant inconsistency in the final moments you just acted out.
Judge:
Goodness! Are you sure, Counsel?
Van Zieks:
You intrigue me, my learned friend. ...But let's see some evidence to support your claim. Where is the proof that demonstrates this inconsistency in the witnesses' portrayal of the victim's final moments?
Present Autopsy Report
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
According to their testimony... ...the witnesses claim to have heard a shout of 'Give me that gun!' followed by the gunshot.
Judge:
Indeed. With the two events happening almost simultaneously, or so we've been led to believe.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's right. Now, if that testimony is true... ...it would mean that at the moment of death, the victim and his attacker would have been facing each other. However...in the autopsy report, it clearly states... ...that the victim died instantly after being shot from behind.
Leads to:
"Ah."

I believe this is all the proof you need!

Van Zieks:
Unfortunately not. I require proof that actually proves something, you see.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (I knew it was a long shot...)
Van Zieks:
It would appear that you have failed to grasp even the bare bones of this case. Perhaps your level of intellect is better suited to the theatricals of these witnesses than advocacy.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
'Gimme that gun! BAM!'
Ringo:
...Kind o' thing! Wanna take the stage wiv us, eh?
Nash:
You could be Sulky if ya like!
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAARGH! (Nash, Ringo and Sulky's Kabuki theatre troupe... No, it would never take off.)
Judge:
I believe the counsel for the defence still wishes to pursue his career in the courts, Lord van Zieks.
Leads back to:
"You intrigue me, my learned friend."
Ah.
Ryunosuke:
So, as I stated before... ...there is an undeniable inconsistency in your testimony, Mr and Mr Skulkin!
NYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
Nash:
But! But! But it's the God's 'onest troof!
Ringo:
It is, Nash, it is! When 'e woz shot that night...
Nash:
...The shopkeeper 'ad a gun in 'is 'and! We saw it wiv our own bleedin' eyes!
Ryunosuke:
Did I hear you right just now? You actually 'saw' Mr Windibank holding a gun?
Ringo:
Erm...
Nash:
...Summat like that might've slipped out.
Van Zieks:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Ladies and gentlemen, you have all just heard the admission by these two witnesses... ...that on the night in question, they actually saw, with their own eyes, the victim wielding a gun. Which can only mean that despite their testimony to the contrary... ...the Skulkin brothers must have encountered the victim in person!
Nash:
Ah...erm...
Ringo:
Erm, Nash, erm!
NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Witnesses! Explain yourselves at once!
Nash:
Well...the thing is... It weren't s'posed to, um...
Van Zieks:
It would seem...that my previous warning fell on deaf ears. I made it quite clear that false witness...would be the death of you.
...!
Judge:
Am I to understand that you replaced the untruths of your original testimony with renewed lies?
Nash:
Um...ever so sorry, guvnor! Troof is, see...we, um...
Ringo:
Cut it out, Nash, cut it out! If we blab now, ya know wot 'e'll do to us...
Ryunosuke:
('He'? Who are they talking about?)
Van Zieks:
Let me make your position here perfectly clear. You will talk. There is no other option available to you.
Ringo:
Ugh...
Nash:
Bruv, come on! The game's up!
Ringo:
B-But 'e'll 'ave our guts fer garters!
Ryunosuke:
In case it hasn't quite sunk in yet... ...no matter how hard you try to hide it...the truth will come out!
Nash:
Ugh...um...
Judge:
On the night in question, it is now apparent that you brothers met face to face with the victim. I demand that you testify again to explain the precise circumstances under which this meeting took place!
Nash:
Erm...well...
Ringo:
...Do we 'ave to?
Van Zieks:
On pain of death. I suggest you make yourselves fully aware that this is your very last chance to tell the truth.
Witness Testimony
- Encounter with the Victim -
Ringo:
Alright, so we'd just got inside the gaff and 'eaved a sigh o' relief when the geezer showed 'is mug!
Nash:
'Gimme that gun!' 'e bellowed, and then 'e flew at us like 'e woz possessed! I thought we'd 'ad it!
Ringo:
For an old geezer, the bloke woz strong as an ox. 'E chucked me over the counter!
Nash:
I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!
Ringo:
We never 'ad nuffin' to do wiv killin' 'im! That's all wot 'appened, I swear!
Van Zieks:
So you're now telling us that moments before the victim was killed in the storeroom... ...you in fact encountered him in the main part of the shop.
Nash:
Um...well...yeah. S-Sorry...
Judge:
Well... ...we find ourselves at an interesting juncture. This changes matters considerably.
Nash:
But, but honest, guvnor, this time...
Ringo:
This time, Nash, this time... we ain't got nuffin' more to 'ide!
Judge:
Very well. Counsel for the Defence, you may proceed with your cross-examination.

Cross-Examination
- Encounter with the Victim -
Ringo:
Alright, so we'd just got inside the gaff and 'eaved a sigh o' relief when the geezer showed 'is mug!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
When you say 'geezer', I presume you mean the victim and proprietor of the shop, Mr Windibank?
Ringo:
Who else- ...Sorry, I mean, that's right!
Nash:
We woz keepin' a close eye on the entrance to the gaff, obviously. But we never thought no one woz gonna come outta the back room like that!
Ryunosuke:
The back room being the pawnbrokery's storeroom?
Ringo:
Yeah, that must be where 'e popped up from. Only place 'e could've been.
Van Zieks:
So it would seem the victim was already in the storeroom when these brothers entered the premises.
Iris:
Which means...Ginny must have been in there at that point as well.
Ryunosuke:
But that doesn't make sense...does it? If Gina had threatened Mr Windibank into the storeroom with her at gunpoint... ...then why would he have emerged from the same room all alone when the brothers arrived?
Iris:
Oh, I...don't know...
Ryunosuke:
Did you see the accused at that time?
Ringo:
Wot, that moll-tooler? Couldn't tell ya!
Nash:
No way, cobber! We 'ad bigger fish to fry then! I mean the old geezer just lost it!
Nash:
'Gimme that gun!' 'e bellowed, and then 'e flew at us like 'e woz possessed! I thought we'd 'ad it!

Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You mentioned that Mr Windibank shouted those words in your previous testimony, too. However, you claimed that you heard him yelling them on the other side of the storeroom door.
Nash:
Oh...um... Hehe. ...Did we?
Ryunosuke:
But the truth is, he he was shouting those words at you, wasn't he?
Nash:
Erm...well... Hehe. ...Yeah.
Van Zieks:
Was the victim - Mr Windibank - wielding a gun at the time?
Ringo:
Woz 'e ever! Blimey lummy! A great ugly barrel 'e 'ad, pointed straight at me frontispiece!
Ryunosuke:
So what you're saying is... ...you definitely saw Mr Windibank with the gun at that time. Is that right?
Ringo:
It is, guv, it is. Spot on.
Nash:
Then all of a sudden 'e came at us, 'e did!
Ringo:
It woz bedlam! I didn't know who woz goin' for who!
Ryunosuke:
...You were clearly all going for each other.
Ringo:

Ringo:
For an old geezer, the bloke woz strong as an ox. 'E chucked me over the counter!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I noted that you mentioned the counter in your previous testimony, too.
Ringo:
Well...yeah...'course we did!
Nash:
'E knocked over a load o' books, a candlestick and some skull wotnot.
Ringo:
That got tangled in some marionette, wot knocked over a picture frame, wot knocked them scales on the floor.
Ryunosuke:
So in fact, it wasn't the sound of the gunshot that shocked you and made you knock those things off the counter?
Nash:
Well...'big' bruv 'ere went flyin' over that counter like a gunshot, I can tell ya! Then the old geezer pinned 'im!
Ringo:
'E did, Nash, 'e did! If you 'adn't been there, the bloke would've flattened me like a bloomin' pancake in seconds!
Van Zieks:
At the time in question, the alarm was raised at the local police station via a secret cable from the pawnbrokery. There is a button under the counter used to activate it, which was presumably pressed by the victim.
Ryunosuke:
(That's right... When the brothers fled the scene and back onto the street... ...they ran straight into the arriving police, didn't they?)
Iris:
Poor Mr Windibank... He did everything he could to protect his shop...
Nash:
I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Were you intending to shoot Mr Windibank?
Nash:
Nah nah nah nah! Never! I, I woz just...ya know... Lookin' out fer me bruv, weren't I? 'E woz bein' flattened, don't forget!
Ryunosuke:
...By a man whose shop was being burgled, yes.
Van Zieks:
And then? The man fled into the storeroom when you pointed your gun at him, is that it?
Nash:
Yeah, that's it. 'E shoved me away, then ran off fru that door an' shut 'imself in!
Ryunosuke:
......... (There's something about that last remark... Something that doesn't quite ring true.)
Iris:
Hm...I wonder why Mr Windibank ran away into the storeroom...
Ryunosuke:
What?
Iris:
Well, according to what everyone's saying... ...Ginny was in there waiting for him...with a gun.
Ryunosuke:
Ah... (Yes, that's right.) Gina allegedly used Mr Windibank's gun to threaten him and force him to open the storeroom door. In which case...how did the gun end up in Mr Windibank's hands again?
Iris:
I have no idea... But that is strange, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
(This little inconsistency could be significant. I should make a mental note of it.)
Nash:
Look, the point is, me an' me bruv 'ere...
Ringo:
That's right, Nash, that's right! Me an' me bruv 'ere...
Ringo:
We never 'ad nuffin' to do wiv killin' 'im! That's all wot 'appened, I swear!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You say you had nothing to do with it?
Nash:
Nuffin' at all!
Ringo:
Nuffin', guv, nuffin'! The old geezer went and shut 'imself in the back room, didn't 'e?
Nash:
Locked, it woz. From the inside.
Ringo:
We know it woz, cos we tried to open it.
Nash:
But it's a decent door, that one. Good an' strong. Wouldn't budge an inch!
Van Zieks:
So in the end, the situation remains unchanged.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
Inside the storeroom with the pawnbroker there was only one other person. The sole person  who could possibly have shot the victim: the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade!
Ryunosuke:
Agh!
Judge:
Hm... It would indeed appear so. What say you to that, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
(I don't know...) Was there anyone else apart from Gina who could possibly have shot Mr Windibank?
There's no one else
Ryunosuke:
(He's right. Gina's the only one. There was no one else in the room!)
Iris:
With an attitude like that, Runo, it really will be all over.
Ryunosuke:
(Now a ten-year-old is reading the expression on my face...)
Iris:
Well, you just don't have that many. Wide-eyed, sweating, smug and happy. That's about it!
Ryunosuke:
(Surely there's more than that... isn't there?)
Iris:
Aaanyway...I think you might want to consider some other possibilities here. ...Or rather, I think you have to. Otherwise we won't get anywhere. ...Or rather, YOU won't get anywhere. I'm just here for moral support, remember.
Leads back to cross-examination
There could have been!
Ryunosuke:
Mr and Mr Skulkin!
Nash:
Eh?! Wot?
Ringo:
Wot's that look for?
Ryunosuke:
From the moment you admitted that you'd encountered the victim face to face that night... ...the course of this trial changed completely.
Nash:
It did?
Van Zieks:
What is your point...my learned friend?
Ryunosuke:
The question we must answer is who could have shot Mr Windibank. And it is the belief of the defence that the defendant is not the only possible answer at all.
Van Zieks:
You have my attention. In that case...let us return to this plan of the premises. The victim was killed in the storeroom, which was locked from the inside. Those are the facts. So pray...what other possible answer to the question of who shot the man could there be?
Judge:
Counsel... ...you must now provide answers to the court in respect of two conundrums.
Ryunosuke:
Two...My Lord? (...Twice as many chances to be right, maybe?)
Judge:
Indeed. Namely... ...from what location did the culprit shoot the victim? And furthermore... ...where was the victim at the time?
Ryunosuke:
......... Understood, My Lord.
Iris:
Are you alright, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
I'm not entirely sure. But there's one thing I am sure about. If I can prove that there's a credible new alternative to what happened... ...it would change Gina's prospects hugely!
Van Zieks:
So now...time for some clarity. Show the court on this plan the answers to the questions posed by His Lordship. If you believe someone else could have killed the victim, indicate from where that person could have fired the gun!
Present anywhere
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The defence believes that the culprit could have shot the victim from this location here.
Van Zieks:
......... And in answer to the second question... Assuming the culprit fired from the location indicated, where was the victim at the time?
Present storeroom (after presenting main shop)
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The culprit shot the victim from outside the storeroom!"
Present storeroom (after presenting storeroom)
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The defence believes that the victim would have been in this position here.
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
What your answers in fact show... ...is that your own position is as absurd as those you have indicated on the plan.
Ryunosuke:
What are you saying?
Judge:
What Lord van Zieks is saying, Counsel... ...is that your answers are clearly flawed!
Ryunosuke:
UWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.)
Iris:
So the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...you have to at least choose a place that's outside the storeroom, don't you?
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Iris:
I mean, if you're saying that someone shot Mr Windibank from inside the storeroom, they'll just say it was Ginny.
Ryunosuke:
......... You're right. (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?)
Give it a try
Ryunosuke:
The defence would like to point out the locations again!
Van Zieks:
Well well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment.
Leads back to:
"So now...time for some clarity."
Leave it
Ryunosuke:
My Lord, I would like to consider the situation a little more before giving my answers again.
Van Zieks:
Consider the situation as much as you like. The answers do not exist.
Judge:
Very well. The court will hear from the witnesses again while you deliberate, Counsel.
Leads back to cross-examination
Otherwise
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The defence believes that the victim would have been in this position here.

Ryunosuke:
UWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.)
Iris:
So the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...I don't see why we can't show that someone other than Ginny could have done it in the storeroom, do you?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's the right way of looking at it, I suppose. Someone other than Gina in the storeroom... (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?)
Give it a try
Ryunosuke:
The defence would like to point out the locations again!
Van Zieks:
Well well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment.

Leads back to cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
(So that's all these brothers are willing to reveal this time, is it?)
Iris:
They're still hiding something, don't you think?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I'm sure of it. And not just a minor detail, either.
Iris:
It was almost certainly because of these two that poor Mr Windibank...well... You can't let them get away with it, Runo!
Ryunosuke:
I know. (But I get the feeling... ...that there's even less evidence at my disposal this time to prove that they did it.)
Iris:
We've come so far... Now it's time to finish them off!
Ryunosuke:
Well, I'll do my best.
Ryunosuke:
The culprit shot the victim from outside the storeroom!
Van Zieks:
......... Continue.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Windibank died instantly from a bullet wound in his back. Looking at the stain of blood on the storeroom floor, it doesn't appear that the body was moved after death. Which tells us that he was almost certainly shot while he was in the storeroom. However, the crucial point is, where was the shooter when the fatal bullet was fired?
Judge:
So you are adamant...that the shot was fired from outside the storeroom?
Ryunosuke:
Well, according to the Skulkin brothers' earlier testimony...
Nash:
I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!
Ryunosuke:
If Mr Windibank ran away through the door... ...we have to assume that the door was open at the time.
Judge:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
It was at precisely that moment, when the victim was fleeing for his life... ...that these brothers had the perfect opportunity to shoot the man in the back once he was inside the storeroom!
NAAAAAAAAAGH!
GAAAAAAAAAGH!
Van Zieks:
...!
Iris:
Come to think of it...do you remember what the prosecutor said at the start of the trial?
Van Zieks:
Moving on to the findings of Scotland Yard's coroner... His report states that the bullet entered the body on a rising diagonal trajectory.
Van Zieks:
It means...the victim was likely shot by someone significantly shorter in height than himself.
Iris:
Poor man... Shot while he was running as fast as he could to safety...
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Of course! He would have been leaning forward as he was running away. So even if the bullet was fired horizontally, it would still have entered his body on an upward trajectory!
Iris:
So the culprit isn't necessarily someone shorter than Mr Windibank!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
I'm sure my learned friend can't have forgotten... ...that the storeroom door was found closed, and...locked from the inside. You claim the victim was shot as he fled into the room. Do you also claim his corpse was dexterous enough to turn the key in the lock?
Ryunosuke:
Agh! But...but... ...what if someone else locked the door? Yes! There is someone else who could have locked the storeroom door!
Van Zieks:
Is that so?
Judge:
Very well then, Counsel. Present your hypothesis to the court. In the scenario just described... ...the defence's assertion is that the victim was shot from outside the storeroom. In which case, who shut and locked the storeroom door from the inside?
Present Gina Lestrade profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Obviously, the person who locked the door was the only other person inside the storeroom at the time..."
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Obviously, that person could only have been...
Iris:
Just a moment, Runo!
Ryunosuke:
Hm? What? I'm just about to point dramatically at the prosecution and unveil an amazing revelation!
Iris:
Sorry, but just before you do, maybe you should take a deep breath and think things through one more time? The storeroom was locked from the inside. So whoever locked it must have been inside, too...don't you think?
Ryunosuke:
Ah, like Mr Windibank, you mean?
Iris:
Well yes, except that he was dead. But there's someone else it could have been. Only one other person, really.
Ryunosuke:
Oh... (Only one other?)
Judge:
You're out of time, I'm afraid. ...For which you must be penalised.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (There's a time limit?)
Judge:
Now then, let me pose the question again.
Leads back to:
"In the scenario just described..."
Ryunosuke:
Obviously, the person who locked the door was the only other person inside the storeroom at the time... ...the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
That's absurd! You're suggesting that the accused deliberately engineered the sealed room? For what possible reason?! Such actions would only serve to tighten the noose around her neck!
Judge:
I am inclined to agree, I must say. ...Well, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
......... Ah...yes...that's a tricky one, that...isn't it?
Judge:
Half-baked notions have no place in my courtroom, Counsel. Remember that, please.
Iris:
But of course Ginny would have locked the door. It almost goes without saying, doesn't it?
Ryunosuke:
It, it does?
Iris:
Well if I was Ginny in that situation... ...I know I would have locked the door. As quickly as I could! I mean... ...those two burglars had just fired a gun in her direction, hadn't they?
Ryunosuke:
(Oh yes! Obviously...) Before the two brothers arrived, Miss Lestrade and Mr Windibank were in the storeroom together. Now...I don't know what went on between them at that time, but at some point... ...Mr Windibank must have heard the intruders breaking into his shop, and left the storeroom.
Ringo:
Intruders, eh? ...That's us, bruv!
Van Zieks:
If your theory is correct, that would leave the accused alone in the storeroom.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, it would. Then, probably only moments later, the victim fled back through the storeroom door hoping to escape danger.
*BANG!*
Ryunosuke:
Hit in the back by the bullet, Mr Windibank fell to the floor where he was, just inside the storeroom. And what we have to ask ourselves now is, what would the defendant have done in that moment?
Nash:
Ah! I, I see where yer goin' wiv this!
Ryunosuke:
Outside the storeroom was a terrifying killer who had just murdered Mr Windibank. As soon as that thought struck Miss Lestrade, she slammed the door shut and locked it... ...in order to save her own life!
Van Zieks:
...!
Judge:
...!
???:
Hold it!
Nash:
But, but I ain't- I mean, we ain't the ones who dunnit!
Ringo:
We ain't, guv, we ain't! You've gotta believe us! I mean, come on! We'd never shoot no one!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
That's blatantly untrue! I know for a fact that you would. Because before my own eyes...you shot Mr Herlock Sholmes!
Ringo:
...!
Nash:
...!
Ryunosuke:
There is only one logical conclusion here. Mr and Mr Skulkin, you brothers had every opportunity... ...to have been the true perpetrators of Mr Windibank's murder!
Nash:
Ah...em...um...
Ringo:
Erm...em...ugh...
NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
Where, where does this leave us?
You mean to say it wasn't the pickpocket who shot the pawnbroker after all?
I should have known it was those three brothers! They look as shady as a dense forest!
Iris:
That was amazing, Runo! All the members of the jury seem to be firmly on your side now!
Ryunosuke:
I know! First time ever! And probably the last...
Iris:
Well, I think you've done it! Surely they'll have to give a verdict of not-
Van Zieks:
...Keh...heh...heh... An admirable effort...my learned friend.
Ryunosuke:
...! (What's this now? He's laughing?)
Judge:
You find the situation amusing, Lord van Zieks? I myself find the defence's argument most persuasive. 
Van Zieks:
I dare say... ...such chicanery is the bread and butter of the street performers in your provincial Eastern nation. But such blatantly malicious conjuring tricks amount to nothing more than inexcusable pettifoggery here.
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Van Zieks:
The hypothesis you put forward so ostensibly credibly cannot, and will not stand. Because, you see, it contains a fatal flaw!
Ryunosuke:
A, a fatal flaw?!
Van Zieks:
...Do you mean to tell me that you're unaware of your logic's failing?
Juror No. 1:
I say! Lord van Zieks... Might be an idea to explain this bally conjuring trick or whatever it is to the troops on the ground, hm?
Van Zieks:
The fatal flaw in my learned friend's argument is really very simple to understand... ...assuming you're not too dim-witted to count bullets!
Juror No. 1:
By George! Count bullets?!
Iris:
Oh dear... ...he noticed then.
Ryunosuke:
Huh? (What's everyone talking about?)
Van Zieks:
Counsel!
Ryunosuke:
Y-Yes, sir?!
Van Zieks:
Tell the court, how many bullets were found at the scene of the crime?
Ryunosuke:
Um...two. Two bullets.
Van Zieks:
Correct. The first, that which hit the victim in the back, ending his life. And the second, that which struck the 'detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes, on his arrival at the scene.
Judge:
Indeed. The defence presented a picture showing the damage caused by the second bullet earlier in the proceedings. The bullet which injured Mr Sholmes appears to have passed through his body to strike the calendar.
Van Zieks:
Your Lordship's understanding is correct. Furthermore, we know there are two firearms involved in the incident. The revolver belonging to the victim, Mr Windibank... ...and the Skulkin brothers' revolver. The evidence shows that a single bullet was fired from each gun.
Judge:
Yes! Indeed it does! A single bullet from each!
Van Zieks:
Now then, my learned friend...
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
You yourself told the court only moments ago... ...that these two brothers shot Mr Herlock Sholmes right before your eyes.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I, I did!
Juror No. 3:
Oh my goodness! I, I think you'll find...
Juror No. 4:
That if the single bullet that was fired from the brothers' gun hit Mr Sholmes, it means...
Juror No. 5:
Windibank not shot by same gun! Stop. Only one bullet! Stop.
Van Zieks:
...Exactly. Yes, this Nipponese street performer presented an ostensibly credible argument. ...However! It was never anything more than a diversionary trick with no hope of standing up to scrutiny!
Ryunosuke:
Ugh............ UWAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!
Van Zieks:
...Pray forgive the discourtesy of flinging the dregs of this hallowed nectar into the public gallery...
Judge:
L-Lord van Zieks!
Van Zieks:
...but this court needs to open its eyes. The accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, is no ordinary little girl. Despite her young years, she can, regrettably, no longer be described as a juvenile. No, the person in the dock is far from a law-abiding citizen. She has a past riddled with criminal conduct!
Juror No. 1:
...!
Juror No. 2:
...!
Van Zieks:
The truth is, the accused broke into the pawnbrokery on the night in question with loathsome intent... ...as we can see beyond doubt in this print which depicts her threatening the victim with the murder weapon!
Juror No. 3:
...!
Juror No. 4:
...!
Van Zieks:
And I have here in my possession one more piece of evidence the prosecution wishes to present.
Ryunosuke:
...! (That disk!)
Gregson:
I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much!
Gina:
No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!
Gregson:
I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, that music box disk... McGilded's music box disk...)
Van Zieks:
The very day before the hateful murder of Mr Windibank... ...the accused attempted to make off with this article, which clearly doesn't belong to her. And with none of the subtlety of a pickpocket, I might add. But by brute force and brazen impudence.
Judge:
Good gracious!
Van Zieks:
Make no mistake! Any sympathy for the accused on account of her years is misguided and dangerous! There are no depths to which this girl would not stoop if pushed. No crime she would not commit. ...The court forgets that fact at its peril.
Juror No. 5:
...!
Juror No. 6:
...!
Judge:
Hm...I see... I think it would be prudent to take this music box disk into evidence, Counsel. As a grim testament to the defendant's character.
???:
Hold it!
Gregson:
Um...Lord van Zieks...I, um...
Ryunosuke:
(Inspector Gregson...what...?)
Van Zieks:
Yes, Inspector?
Gregson:
We had a meetin' yesterday at the Yard with the prosecution service, and, um... ...I, I think it was agreed that that disk wouldn't be used as evidence.
Van Zieks:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(What's this all about? Why is the inspector acting strangely? That's the first time he's said anything to van Zieks at all...)
Van Zieks:
I am unaware of any such meeting.
Gregson:
But! But those were the instructions, right from the top. The government bigwigs were insistent!
Van Zieks:
Inspector, I am the prosecutor, and I alone determine how to present my case. Your warning is noted. ...Thank you.
Gregson:
...!
Van Zieks:
The prosecution wishes to proceed with submitting this disk as evidence, My Lord.
Judge:
In-Indeed. Bailiff!
The music box disk has been entered into the Court Record.
Van Zieks:
The prosecution has established the accused's motive, opportunity and baseness of character. There is nothing more to add. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I await your informed decisions...and rest my case.
Examine evidence
Music Box Disk
Bloodstain
Iris:
Oh! Runo, look! This is blood!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, you're right. (Just a small smear, but definitely blood. Actually, I feel as though I might have noticed that before...)
Iris:
Haha! Then it's my time to shine again! I thought I'd be waiting forever! Alright, hold still with that disk, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
Can we get this done quickly, Iris?
Iris:
In a flash! Ooh! A lovely bright shade again.
Ryunosuke:
......... (Wait, that colour...)
Iris:
What is it?
Ryunosuke:
It's just...that green, it... ...it's not the first time we've seen that colour, is it?
The blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record.
Bloodstain (subsequent times)
Iris:
So this is blood! Probably from somebody's fingertip.
Ryunosuke:
Well deduced. But not just somebody's fingertip... Mr Benedict's fingertip.
Iris:
The man dressed all in white?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It happened that afternoon in Windibank's. Gina tried to snatch this disk out of the man's hands, and the sharp little bumps cut his thumb.
Iris:
So the lesson is, if someone tries to grab a music box disk from you, let go quickly.
Ryunosuke:
...The lesson is don't snatch things, surely?
Note on back
Iris:
'For McGilded'... That's the man you defended in court a couple of months ago, isn't it, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Or rather, mistakenly defended.
Iris:
I wonder what his name is doing on the back of this disk...
Ryunosuke:
That's a question I'd love to know the answer to myself.
Ryunosuke:
(I don't believe it... I had the jury on my side for once, for all of five minutes...)
Iris:
Oh dear... It wasn't even for five minutes, Runo...
???:
My Lord!
Juror No. 1:
Wonder if I might say something at this point?
Judge:
Proceed, Mr Foreman.
Juror No. 1:
Been stumbling about in a bit of a fog up to now, if truth be told. But all of a sudden... ...the answer's bally obvious to me and my men! There's only one thing for it!
Ryunosuke:
(Oh no!)
Judge:
Very well. The court will hear from the jury. Ladies and gentlemen, you will present your leanings as to the defendant's culpability.
Juror No. 1:
Guilty!
Juror No. 2:
Guilty!
Juror No. 3:
Guilty!
Juror No. 4:
Guilty!
Juror No. 5:
Guilty!
Juror No. 6:
Guilty!
Judge:
We have a consensus among the jury, it seems.
Van Zieks:
When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains...must be the truth.
Iris:
That's, that's my line! I wrote that! For Hurley! Argh! How dare he use it against us?!
Ryunosuke:
Don't worry, Iris. I don't think we're finished yet. (There's still more to this case than we realise. There must be, because there's one thing that I'm absolutely certain of. Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank! That's beyond any doubt!)
Judge:
Very well... ...we will proceed with the second summation examination of the day. Mr Foreman, are you and the other jurors ready?
Juror No. 1:
Garrideb Squadron is primed and ready for action, sir!
Judge:
Very good. So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have now determined the defendant to be guilty!

Juror No. 2:
As only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.
Juror No. 3:
You don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!
Juror No. 4:
Hm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...
Juror No. 5:
The accused attempted a theft on the previous day. ...I can see I'm in for a busy day ahead.
Juror No. 6:
I am ballistics expert. I have seen many shootings. There is nothing I do not know about guns.
Judge:
Hmmm... It would seem there is little remaining room for doubt.
Juror No. 1:
Have to admit, I was rather bowled over by the argument put forward by the chap in black. But when that fell apart like a house of cards, I saw that I'd jolly well been hoodwinked. Well, no more!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...the whole courtroom is turning against me.)
Iris:
It's not fair!
Ryunosuke:
Iris?
Iris:
That prosecutor's being mean! Just because Ginny's done some things she shouldn't have done in the past... ...that doesn't make her a murderer!
Van Zieks:
Allow me to savour this fruity vintage while I savour the spectacle of your fruitless debate on the matter. Here's to the truth coming out...eventually.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Judge:
That's enough preamble. Counsel, proceed with the summation examination.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, My Lord.

Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Just because Miss Lestrade has a history of pickpocketing, she must be guilty of murder, is that what you're saying?
Juror No. 1:
Ah...well...
Ryunosuke:
Are all members of the British army so quick to judge?
Juror No. 1:
I beg your pardon? Are you mocking Her Majesty's armed forces? The greatest military organisation in the world!
Ryunosuke:
No. I'm simply illustrating my point.
Juror No. 1:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Making assumptions about people because they're a soldier...or a pickpocket...is wrong, and dangerous.
Juror No. 1:
Hmph. Well, yes, might have a point there, I suppose. But let's not forget the girl had already shown she had it in her from before. She's clearly a criminal sort through and through. Can't deny it.
Ryunosuke:
When you say that she'd 'shown she had it in her'...are you referring to this?
Juror No. 1:
Exactly. Tried to swipe that only a day earlier, hm? Or am I mistaken?
Ryunosuke:
...Not exactly. (Given that I was actually there at the time, it's hard to refute that.)
Iris:
I've never actually seen the real thing. I can't wait to have a closer look at it!
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes, of course... Mr Sholmes did use his caramel bars to make a copy of the disk, didn't he. (And then ordered every type of music box he could find from across Europe...)
Iris:
We still don't know what tune it plays though, do we? But I'd love to see how the original compares to Hurley's copy.
Ryunosuke:
(McGilded's disk... Could it be a clue somehow? Perhaps we should examine it in more detail...)
Juror No. 2:
As only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
It's the number of bullets that has you convinced?
Juror No. 2:
Only two bullets were fired, and the two guns that fired them have been examined by the police. When the parlour maid asks me how many are invited for dinner, I always tell her to count the table settings.
Ryunosuke:
(Well, that's logical, I suppose.)
Juror No. 2:
Although...
Ryunosuke:
Yes?
Juror No. 2:
...sometimes after dining, crockery does go missing. One or two guests rather like the fine china.
Ryunosuke:
...Does your employer dine with thieves?
Juror No. 2:
So I suppose... ...if there was another bullet somewhere of which we were unaware... ...I'd have to reconsider my position.
Ryunosuke:
(...A third bullet somewhere on the scene? Could that be possible?)
It's impossible
Ryunosuke:
Unfortunately... ...only two bullets were discovered by the police during their investigation.
Juror No. 2:
Yes, I know.
Ryunosuke:
Right...
Juror No. 2:
And I don't imagine the good men of Scotland Yard would have overlooked anything. If I missed a bullet while I was cleaning His Lordship's office, well! I should receive a sound scolding, I don't doubt.
Ryunosuke:
...And he should receive a visit from the police, perhaps. It sounds like a crime scene to me.
Iris:
Hm, a third bullet....
Ryunosuke:
It would completely turn things around if there was one, wouldn't it?
Iris:
...Do you think we might find one lying around somewhere?
Leads back to cross-examination
I can prove it!
Ryunosuke:
Allow me to show you, then...the third bullet!
Present The Third Bullet
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Here it is."
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
I, um...don't suppose this would pass as the third bullet?
Van Zieks:
It passes for a bullet as much as you pass for a lawyer... my learned friend.
Ryunosuke:
(Coming from you, I'm going to take that as meaning, 'not much'.)
Van Zieks:
In no way does it resemble a bullet...if that helps your understanding of my last remark.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Judge:
Counsel, at the very least I would expect the evidence you present to be of the correct form!
Ryunosuke:
(...It's been a long day.)
Iris:
Let's actually try to find this third bullet before we attempt that again, Runo.
Leads back to cross-examination
Juror No. 3:
You don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So if I've understood correctly, you need two pictures: a left eye one and a slightly different right eye one.
Juror No. 3:
Eeexactly! Then you can see the scene in three dimensions ...like this!
Ryunosuke:
So...if we have two bullets...I don't suppose you can see anything useful with them?
Juror No. 3:
Hm, I think you'll find... ...that no matter how much you squint, the truth of the situation always looks the same here. The only person who could have shot the victim is that girl in the dock!
Ryunosuke:
How can you be so sure of that?
Juror No. 3:
Think about it! The Skulkin brothers shot the great detective, didn't they?
Ryunosuke:
Yes...that's been mentioned once or twice...
Juror No. 3:
Well then! Surely it's coming into focus now, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
(This is a waste of time. I'm not going to change this man's mind any time soon.)
Juror No. 4:
Hm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Would you please stop muttering about things that have nothing to do with this trial, sir? The defendant's life is on the line here!
Juror No. 4:
Hm, well, the thing is... ...I couldn't really say that it is nothing to do with this trial, to be honest.
Ryunosuke:
Huh?
Juror No. 4:
I mean, there's no question that the man was shot, but the bullet had simply vanished from his stomach. It's quite inexplicable. ...Don't you think?
Ryunosuke:
......... I almost don't want to ask, but this surgery you've been muttering about all this time. You were operating on...
Juror No. 4:
What was the fellow's name now? Herr Lich? ...No. Herr Loch? ...No. Hairlock?
Ryunosuke:
Herlock Sholmes by any chance?
Juror No. 4:
Yes! Good Lord! It was that Hairlock fellow!
Ryunosuke:
WHAAAT?! You're, you're the surgeon that operated on Mr Sholmes?!
Juror No. 4:
That's right. Using the very latest anaesthesia techniques, I might add! It was a fairly major op, I can tell you.
Ryunosuke:
(This is crazy!)
Juror No. 4:
Let me see, the fellow was brought in not long after midnight, if I remember correctly. They said he'd been shot by some criminal or other. So I opened him up like a shot. But the funny thing is, I went over his insides with a fine-tooth comb, and couldn't find the bullet anywhere. So I'm afraid I had to throw up my hands and just stitch the fellow back up.
Ryunosuke:
......... I hate to state the obvious, but...
Juror No. 4:
Yes?
Ryunosuke:
...surely that's because the bullet is still at the scene of the shooting!
Judge:
The counsel for the defence is correct. As is clearly shown in this photographic print.
Ryunosuke:
The bullet that the Skulkin brothers fired at Mr Sholmes hit him in the stomach region... ...then exited his body and lodged into the shop wall where the calendar was hanging by the door. I think you'll find it's really quite simple if you just consider the problem three-dimensionally.
Juror No. 4:
Hah! Who do you think I am, son?
Ryunosuke:
...Um, well, 'juror number four' is about the best I can do.
Juror No. 4:
As soon as I saw the wound to the man's stomach, I flipped him over.
Ryunosuke:
...Like a pancake? Are, are you saying that you checked his back?
Juror No. 4:
Of course I did! And there wasn't a trace of injury. No sign that the bullet had left the body at all!
Ryunosuke:
What?
Juror No. 4:
That's the point! The only logical conclusion was that the bullet was still somewhere in the man's innards! Which is exactly why I set about slicing him up! And I'm still none the wiser, even now! How many times do I have to say it? Can somebody please explain how it happened? Can somebody please solve the mystery!
Ryunosuke:
...It's almost as much of a mystery as how this jury was put together.
Changes Juror No. 4's statement to "The mystery of where that bullet ended up is infuriating! Where's an expert when you need one?"
Juror No. 4:
The mystery of where that bullet ended up is infuriating! Where's an expert when you need one?
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes's surgeon is on the jury...? I've experienced some coincidences recently, but this is ridiculous.
Juror No. 4:
I'm as surprised as anyone!
Ryunosuke:
But there's no question that Mr Sholmes was shot?
Juror No. 4:
Well, that's what the police told me when they brought him in.
Iris:
...How bad were his injuries, doctor?
Juror No. 4:
He was in a bad way. He'd lost a huge amount of blood, you know. And I suspect he was shot at quite close range, too. Because his skin was badly burnt around the point of entry.
Ryunosuke:
Burnt?
Juror No. 4:
As I said, I flipped the fellow over and examined his back, but there was no sign of an exit wound. Which is why I thought I'd better locate the lug and pop it out.
Ryunosuke:
And yet you say you found no bullet inside the patient?
Juror No. 4:
Well I wouldn't have done, would I? Because it's in the wall of the pawnbroker's. But how did it get there?! I need someone to solve this mystery before it drives me to insanity! If only there were some expert in ballistics who could help! Even if he looked extremely untrustworthy!
Ryunosuke:
(So we have a disappearing bullet on our hands...)
Pit against Juror No. 6's statement
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Those two statements clearly contradict...the idea that all I do is pit jurors against each other!
Juror No. 4:
Ooh! A ballistics expert!
Juror No. 6:
'Pitting'... 'P-i-t-t-...'
Ryunosuke:
On the night in question, Mr Sholmes was shot by one of the Skulkin brothers. But since there was no sign of an exit wound on his back, we must assume the bullet didn't pass through him. However, no bullet was found lodged in Mr Sholmes's body, either. Furthermore... ...a bullet was found lodged in the wall of the shop where Mr Sholmes was shot. Juror number six...
Juror No. 6:
'Hello. My name is Vilen. Pleased to meet you.'
Ryunosuke:
This apparent contradiction in the facts that is so clearly troubling juror number four... Are you able to explain the mystery?
Juror No. 6:
......... I have seen wery similar situation in motherland.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Juror No. 6:
It was night. There was blizzard. I was running away long mountain round in freezing cold.
Judge:
Golly.
Juror No. 6:
The snow was piling high on both sides of road. It was wery narrow and dangerous. My pursuers had hunting rifles and they were on dog sleds.
Ryunosuke:
(...Mental note: don't ask too many questions.)
Juror No. 6:
I was shot from behind, and I fell down in snow. And this situation was wery similar to what I hear today from doctor. They could not find bullet in my body. And no sign of - how do you say? - exit wound.
Judge:
Then, then where did the bullet go?
Juror No. 6:
Bullet never hit me.
Juror No. 4:
Well if it never hit you, why did you fall down?
Juror No. 6:
Bullet hit frozen wall of ice wery close to my side.
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Juror No. 6:
One small piece - wery sharp - broke away from lump of ice and pierced my body. It made deep wound that looks just like bullet wound.
Juror No. 4:
Good gracious...
Juror No. 6:
Of course, piece of ice quickly melted inside me. And that is solution to mystery of disappearing bullet.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Juror No. 6:
.........
Juror No. 4:
But, but that doesn't answer the question at all!
Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Juror No. 4:
The shooting happened in a pawnbroker's shop... ...not some snowy mountain road in another country!
Ryunosuke:
......... ...Just an idea, but we might not be looking at EXACTLY the same scenario here.
Iris:
Runo... ...where exactly was Hurley shot again?
Ryunosuke:
Um, well, according to the report, in his stomach. Sort of around this area, I think.
Iris:
Well...that's precisely where he always wears a little pouch on his belt.
Ryunosuke:
A pouch? (Actually, I might have noticed something like that.)
Iris:
Yes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three glass phials of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations.
Ryunosuke:
What?! (Really?) Doctor! Where is the pouch Mr Sholmes was wearing?
Juror No. 4:
Hm, well... ...the fellow had nothing like that on his person when he arrived at the hospital as far as I remember.
Van Zieks:
If I may...
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks...?
Van Zieks:
While I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Van Zieks:
As I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound.
Juror No. 4:
Ah! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment!
Van Zieks:
Since then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred.
Judge:
Very well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed.
Bring forth Mr Herlock Sholmes's pouch!
Judge:
Hm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it?
Ryunosuke:
Look at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded!
Judge:
Exploded?
Ryunosuke:
So...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch.
Juror No. 4:
And it was the glass phial exploding that caused the fellow's injury!
Juror No. 6:
The bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop.
Van Zieks:
......... ...A delightfully complex aroma.
Judge:
Well, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least.
Van Zieks:
Though it has no bearing on the truth of this case.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
The bungling and burgling brothers shot the detective, and the accused shot the pawnbroker. The pertinent facts of the case remain unaltered.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Juror No. 4:
But at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man!
Juror No. 6:
...Da. 'Thank you wery much.'
Ryunosuke:
...Glad I could help.
Judge:
Due to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence.
Iris:
Hurley's pouch isn't scruffy!
Sholmes's pouch has been entered into the Court Record.
Judge:
Now, the summation examination... It would appear the defence is somewhat struggling to alter opinion, hm?
Ryunosuke:
Please, My Lord! A little more time. (After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!)
Changes Juror No. 4's statement to "Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better."
Examine evidence
Sholmes's Pouch
Scorch mark on left side
Ryunosuke:
(It's really scorched badly just here...)
Iris:
Oh! The strap is broken, look!
Ryunosuke:
This must be where the bullet hit, then.
Iris:
Let me see...
Bullet
Ryunosuke:
Wh-What the... Iris! Look! Behind where the broken phial was... Do you see it?
Iris:
AAAH! That's... ...the Skulkin brothers' bullet!
Ryunosuke:
(What a stroke of luck that it hit his pouch!) This is an amazing discovery! (What this means is... ...there were three bullets fired at Windibank's that night!)
Iris:
We've found exactly what that juror was talking about! The third bullet!
Ryunosuke:
It's time to press that juror again, I think!
The third bullet has been entered into the Court Record.
Bullet hole (after examining bullet)
Ryunosuke:
(This is where the third bullet was lodged. Imagine what would have happened if it had pierced the leather... Thank goodness Mr Sholmes is going to be alright.)
Scorch mark on left side (after examining bullet)
Ryunosuke:
(It's really scorched badly just here...)
Iris:
Yes, the strap is broken.
Ryunosuke:
Ripped apart by the bullet, obviously. 
Iris:
Let me see...
Hole on back
Ryunosuke:
Oh look...there's a hole here at the back. (It doesn't look much like a bullet hole. But clearly something's ripped through the leather with great force.)
Iris:
Something must have pierced it somehow to have left this hole behind.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it looks that way. Mr Sholmes and his pouch both took a beating, didn't they?
Broken white vial
Ryunosuke:
This phial has been smashed to pieces. Presumably this is where the bullet struck.
Iris:
As soon as the bullet hit the chemical in that phial, there would have been a really big explosion.
Ryunosuke:
A big explosion?!
Iris:
Well Hurley's potions and chemicals are amazingly useful for the investigation work he does. But they're also quite tricky to handle. Safely, at least. They're very dangerous.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Iris:
I'm sure that when this phial broke, the chemical inside would have ignited.
Ryunosuke:
......... (Note to self: Always walk on the right-hand side of Sholmes in future. The left is the danger zone.)
Purple or yellow vial
Iris:
These glass phials are full of Hurley's homemade potions.
Ryunosuke:
Homemade...?
Iris:
Yes, like fingerprint powder to show up where people have touched things... ...and scent-amplifying solution to intensify a smell lingering on an object.
Ryunosuke:
That's...amazing.
Iris:
They're all very easy to use. There's just one thing that you have to be careful of: They're all very flammable.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes is a walking bomb! (Either he's passionate about finding out the truth, or just oblivious to the dangers...)
The Third Bullet
Bullet
Ryunosuke:
This is the bullet that was fired from the Skulkin brothers' gun on the night of the incident.
Iris:
Yes. So it turns out it never actually entered Hurley's body at all.
Ryunosuke:
Thanks to the thick leather of that pouch he was wearing. It saved him.
Iris:
Hehe, Hurley's always lucky like that.
Ryunosuke:
Well...considering what he had to go through in hospital... ...I wonder how lucky he really was.
Iris:
Oh dear...poor Hurley...
Juror No. 4:
Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Then I ask you to reconsider your leaning, sir!
Juror No. 4:
Oh no, that's another matter entirely.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Juror No. 4:
All I can think about for the moment...is this wonderful sense of relief I have that the mystery is solved. I need some time to let that sink in before I could possibly consider anything else.
Ryunosuke:
Alright... (I thought surgeons had to be able to think quickly...)
Iris:
Perhaps we should leave him alone for now while he savours his inner peace... ...and focus on some of the other jurors?
Ryunosuke:
I suppose we'll have to. ...I wish I had the chance to experience inner peace sometimes.
Juror No. 5:
The accused attempted a theft on the previous day. ...I can see I'm in for a busy day ahead.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean, you're in for a busy day?
Juror No. 5:
Forgot to say. Stop. Do excuse me. Stop. I am a communications officer. Stop.
Ryunosuke:
A communications officer? Does that have something to do with sending telegrams?
Juror No. 5:
Everything from personal messages written by members of the public to the latest news in the capital. I convert all the messages into morse code and tap it out to the entire world electronically.
Ryunosuke:
To...the entire world?
Juror No. 5:
Thousands of miles of cable under the sea! Stop. Worldwide communication network! Stop. Information transmitted to and from all corners of globe! Stop.
Ryunosuke:
(Ah yes... ...she was getting equally worked up about radio waves or the like before, wasn't she?)
Juror No. 5:
I specialise in communicating information from government departments and newspaper offices.
Ryunosuke:
I see.
Juror No. 5:
I'm sure I shall have to wire the newspaper reports of today's guilty verdict later. So no sleep for me tonight, I imagine.
Ryunosuke:
(...Let's just finish the trial first, shall we?)
Juror No. 6:
I am ballistics expert. I have seen many shootings. There is nothing I do not know about guns.
Press
Ryunosuke:

Ryunosuke:

Juror No. 6:
......... 'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.'
Ryunosuke:
(...There's no way he's just a 'wisiting' tourist.) So...you're a ballistics expert? ...Who knew?
Juror No. 6:
I have much experience with guns.
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Juror No. 6:
I have lived through many - how do you say? Em... Extreme...em...wiolent...bath of...em... No. Blood of...em...
Iris:
Ah! Extreme violent bloodbaths, perhaps?
Juror No. 6:
Da! Those! Extreme wiolent bloodbaths! ...English is wery difficult language.
Ryunosuke:
(...Considering the sort of people you associate with, I'm surprised you still have a tongue.)
Juror No. 6:
Anyway. If you have questions about bullets and guns, you ask me. There is nothing I do not know. No mystery I cannot solve.
Ryunosuke:
(He's very confident in his knowledge of guns, that's for sure.)
Juror No. 6:
But...if possible, please, only in Russian language.
Iris:
He's not very confident in his knowledge of English, though, is he?
Ryunosuke:
No... Still, we should bear it in mind. (He's our man if there's a mystery about guns or bullets.)
Pit against Juror No. 4's statement

Before Sholmes's Pouch is added to Court Record
Ryunosuke:
(Van Zieks has managed to convince everyone...)
Iris:
'When you have eliminated the impossible...' he said. But he hasn't!
Ryunosuke:
(If we're going to fight back, we need more material. And we have to fight back! We have to turn this trial around again!)
After Sholmes's Pouch is added to Court Record
Iris:
Hurley always turns up at just the right moment!
Ryunosuke:
...Does he always come in the form of a pouch? (Seriously though, it sounds like the great detective was on death's door. But maybe his injuries won't be for nothing. That pouch could be a very valuable clue.)
Ryunosuke:
Here it is. We discovered it just now. Yes! On the night in question in Windibank's pawnbrokery...another bullet was fired!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
What is this new trickery, you Nipponese conjurer?! Where did you find that bullet?
Ryunosuke:
It was lodged inside Mr Sholmes's pouch.
Van Zieks:
What?!
Ryunosuke:
This pouch was removed from around Mr Sholmes's waist before he was taken to hospital. And since then, it has been touched by no one.
Judge:
Do, do you mean to say... ...the shot fired by the Skulkin brothers that night...
Ryunosuke:
Yes. As your Lordship has surmised...it hit this pouch.
Judge:
But that makes no sense whatsoever! We already know the whereabouts of the bullet fired at Mr Sholmes. It's clearly visible in this photographic print!
Juror No. 1:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
Two guns from the scene have already been submitted into the Court Record as evidence.
Judge:
Yes. That of Mr Windibank, and that belonging to the Skulkin brothers.
Ryunosuke:
And examination of both guns revealed... ...that only a single bullet had been fired from each.
Juror No. 2:
Ah!
Juror No. 3:
But, but that must mean...
Ryunosuke:
That's right. We now know that on the night in question, three bullets were fired. However! Only two bullets were fired from the guns recovered from the crime scene! And until that incontrovertible inconsistency is somehow explained... ...we cannot and must not pass judgement!
Van Zieks:
Agk......... AAAAAAAAARGH!!!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! While this summation examination remains incomplete, the court has been presented with new facts. Facts that would appear to shake the very foundations upon which the case against the defendant has been built.
Van Zieks:
...!
Judge:
As is my prerogative in this situation... ...I hereby temporarily suspend the summation examination.
Juror No. 1:
By Jupiter!
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Judge:
Bailiff! Bring the witnesses back to the stand at once!
Judge:
Witnesses...
Nash:
Guvnor!
Judge:
Were you listening to proceedings while the defence carried out the summation examination?
Ringo:
We woz, guvnor, we woz!
Van Zieks:
Perhaps we can dispense with the tedious preamble. Simply answer this one question: A third bullet has been identified at the scene of the crime. ...What do you make of that?
Nash:
Make of it, guv? I dun't make nuffin' of nuffin' if I can 'elp it. Um...
Van Zieks:
Is it one of yours?
Ringo:
Gorblimey, guv, gorblimey! Not a chance!
Van Zieks:
In that case...did you have an accomplice?
Nash:
Wot?! Eh? Wot?! Never! The Skulkin bruvvers work alone!
Ringo:
It's just the two of us! That's our trademark!
Ryunosuke:
(...How soon we forget poor Sulky...)
Van Zieks:
Only two of the bullets from the crime scene originated from the firearms we have in evidence. The third bullet was fired from another gun. ...Where is it?
Nash:
Lummy...that's an 'ead-scratcher... .........
Judge:
Hmmm... Counsel for the Defence...
Ryunosuke:
Y-Yes?
Judge:
I should like to hear your thoughts regarding these new developments. The third bullet...and the mysterious missing firearm from whence it came.
Ryunosuke:
(Thinking back over all the testimony we've heard and all the evidence we've seen... ...I think I'm starting to form a picture. A picture of what really happened that night.) My Lord, I think it's clear what this third bullet tells us about the Skulkin brothers:
They had a secret accomplice
Ryunosuke:
On that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been working with a third man.
Nash:
Erm...
Ryunosuke:
The witnesses are clearly doing their best to cover up the existence of this accomplice... ...but the evidence all points to the fact that there was someone else present! Someone carrying a gun!
Van Zieks:
Leads to:
"...An accomplice, you say?"
They had another gun
Ryunosuke:
On that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been in possession of another gun.
Nash:
Erm...
Ryunosuke:
We know that only one bullet was fired from each of the two firearms already in the Court Record. The logical conclusion, therefore... ...is that the brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun!
Leads to:
"...An accomplice, you say?"
It's nothing to do with them
Ryunosuke:
I believe...it has nothing to do with them.
Nash:
Eh?
Ringo:
Eh, Nash, eh! That's right!
Nash:
Yeah! Nuffin' to do wiv us, guv!
Ryunosuke:
We've established that one bullet was fired from each of the two guns already known to the court. The logical conclusion therefore, is that on the night in question at Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...there was another person present in possession of a third firearm.
Van Zieks:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Whilst the brothers may have had nothing to do with the third gun or the bullet fired from it... ...it's inconceivable that they had nothing to do with the third man. Yes! The brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun!
Leads to:
"...An accomplice, you say?"
Van Zieks:
...An accomplice, you say? Pigswill.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
These protracted proceedings have already forced us to endure two summation examinations. Yet in all that time, there has been not a murmur of a third man. If this apparently wraithlike being exists... ...the court must be shown hard evidence! Without it, this fantasy will be crushed.
Ryunosuke:
Agh!
Van Zieks:
The prosecution demands answers on two counts: Firstly: proof - evidence - that this accomplice was ever at the scene of the crime. And secondly... ...the identity of this spurious character.
Ryunosuke:
(The Skulkins are lying. I know that. But... ...how can I ascertain the identity of the person they're hiding?)
Judge:
Well, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
......... (I'm supposed to prove the existence of this accomplice... and reveal the person's identity, even...) In response to the prosecution's demands, My Lord, the defence is...
Ready to present answers
Ryunosuke:
The defence is ready. I believe I can provide all the answers the prosecution demands.
Van Zieks:
So, my Nipponese friend, despite the swimming eyes, you seem to think you have something to say. This promises to be interesting.
Ryunosuke:
(I have to push forward now. There's no other option. I need to use every single piece of evidence available to me if it will make a difference...)
Leads to:
"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay."
Unable to present answers
Ryunosuke:
The defence is... .........
Van Zieks:
Unable to complete a sentence, it would seem. Much less provide any credible answers here.
Judge:
Yes, it would appear so. Very well, this trial will now-
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Wait! Please!
Judge:
Good gracious, Counsel!
Ryunosuke:
(I have to keep the momentum going here. I can't give up now!)
Iris:
This is just like scientific research if you ask me.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Iris:
When you start doubting yourself and thinking you can't possibly work something out, you become blind. Even though in truth, the answer you're looking for is right there in front of you.
Ryunosuke:
(The answer...is right here in front of me!) ...My Lord! Actually...the defence would like to present answers to the questions posed by the prosecution.
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
So, my Nipponese friend, despite the swimming eyes, you seem to think you have something to say. But your earlier tongue-tied display will not go unpunished.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (Now I wish I'd bit my tongue instead of speaking before I'd made up my mind. It would have hurt less.)
Leads to:
"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay."
Judge:
In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay. On the night in question, in the moments leading up to the death of the victim... ...what proof have you that there was a third intruder present at the scene?
Present Blood Samples Portfolio
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The evidence is right here...in this portfolio."
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The evidence...is this!
Judge:
...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Van Zieks:
My learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer.
Ryunosuke:
AAARGH!
Iris:
Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally.
Ryunosuke:
The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...)
Leads back to:
"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay."
Ryunosuke:
The evidence is right here...in this portfolio.
Judge:
By Jove! That portfolio again, is it?
Van Zieks:
Do you expect the court to rifle through your papers itself? Be more specific!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
You claim one of those blood samples proves the presence of this third intruder. Well, which one is it?
Present Windibank's Main Shop sample
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"What am I looking at here?"
Present any other sample
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
THIS is the blood sample that proves it!
Judge:
...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Van Zieks:
You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen.
Ryunosuke:
AAARGH!
Iris:
Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally.
Ryunosuke:
The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...)
Leads back to:
"You claim one of those blood samples proves the presence of this third intruder."
Judge:
What am I looking at here? There appears to be some green paint or suchlike around the bullet hole in the middle of the calendar.
Ryunosuke:
That's a bloodstain, My Lord.
Judge:
A bloodstain?
Van Zieks:
Green blood? Curious, even for you. Is the court to understand that the intruder was some unhuman creature?
Ryunosuke:
It's...something developed by Mr Herlock Sholmes.
Juror No. 3:
By the great detective!
Juror No. 5:
New invention! Stop. Not yet appeared in stories! Stop.
Iris:
It's this, you see. It...doesn't have a name yet, though. This fogger sprays a chemical that reacts with the different elements in people's blood to change its colour.
Judge:
Different elements...of people's blood...?
Iris:
Yes. Everyone's blood is slightly different, you see. Because it's made up of different elements. So by seeing what colour it changes to, you can tell in a flash whose blood it is!
Juror No. 3:
Ooh! That brings a whole extra dimension to looking at blood!
Juror No. 5:
Talk of blood in courtroom! Stop. Very exciting! Stop.
Ryunosuke:
As an example, this one shows the blood of the victim, Mr Windibank.
Judge:
Ah... A striking blue.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. So you see, the green colour of this bloodstain on the calendar... ...shows that somebody else was shot in the main part of the shop!
Juror No. 1:
Now hold fire there, young man! Could be from some unrelated incident, couldn't it?
Ryunosuke:
No. It's not unrelated.
Juror No. 1:
...!
Ryunosuke:
The date showing on the calendar is the date on which Mr Windibank was killed.
Juror No. 1:
By golly!
Ryunosuke:
Therefore we can assume that whoever was shot, was shot on the same day.
Juror No. 4:
Then whose blood is it?!
Ryunosuke:
Well, the Skulkin brothers in the stand don't appear to be suffering from any gunshot injuries... Which means it must be the blood of somebody else. The third intruder, in fact.
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Whose identity the court is still waiting to hear. You can't delay this any longer, my learned friend. Who is this alleged third intruder?
Present Eggert Benedict profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The man's name...is Eggert Benedict."
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
There can be no doubt! THIS is the shadowy accomplice the brothers have been trying so hard to protect!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
A lottery? Is that how you decide who's guilty?
Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Van Zieks:
In that case, the name Ryunosuke Naruhodo should be added to the draw. For being guilty of incompetence!
Ryunosuke:
GAAAAAAGH! (...And I bet my lot would be drawn, too.)
Iris:
The identity of this accomplice is our trump card, Runo. 
Ryunosuke:
Yes...I, I expect it is...
Iris:
At this point, we're the only ones who know the person's identity. But it's time to stun the courtroom now! Let's give everyone something to think about!
Ryunosuke:
Yes... YES!
Leads back to:
"You can't delay this any longer, my learned friend."!
Ryunosuke:
The man's name...is Eggert Benedict.
Judge:
Eggert Benedict?! Who on earth are you talking about, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
He paid a visit to Windibank's pawnbrokery on the afternoon before the incident took place.
Van Zieks:
When the accused attempted to deceive the pawnbroker into releasing this article into her possession.
Ryunosuke:
...That's right.
Van Zieks:
...!
Ryunosuke:
The man identified by the defence, Mr Eggert Benedict... ...then attempted to take the article from the defendant by force.
???:
Broker!
Windibank:
Um, yes, sir?
???:
I believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemed an article from you, no?
Windibank:
Yes, yes, erm...
???:
The article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once.
Gina:
Now that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull?
???:
Give me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too.
Ryunosuke:
Inspector Gregson was there at the time, and can attest to what happened. In the end, it was the inspector himself who took the disk.
Judge:
Can you corroborate this account, Inspector?
Gregson:
Erm, yes, My Lord. That's more or less what happened. And in the interests of bein' thorough, I asked Windibank for a print showin' the fellow. Taken from one of his 'Red-Handed Recorder' gubbinses.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes! That's him talking to Mr Windibank that morning.)
Judge:
And you claim this man is the brothers' accomplice?
Ryunosuke:
Well, Mr and Mr Skulkin?
Nash:
......... Never seen the geezer before in me life!
Ringo:
On me life, guv, on me life! Never seen 'im!
Judge:
Well...somewhat unsurprisingly, it appears our witnesses disagree with the assertion.
Van Zieks:
I'm sure Your Lordship recalls my learned Nipponese friend's actual assertion. Which was that he could prove the identity of the alleged accomplice.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, and I can!
Juror No. 3:
Then show us the evidence!
Juror No. 2:
I agree! We must see proof that the clean-cut gentleman in the photograph is the filthy criminal you say he is!
Ryunosuke:
......... (This is the last piece of evidence... I've had a feeling that something has been missing in this trial from the very start. But now...I'm going to drag it kicking and screaming into the courtroom!)
Judge:
Are you ready to present your answer to the court then, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. The defence will present the evidence now. Proof that the man pictured in this photographic print was in fact the person struck by the third bullet!
Present Music Box Disk (after examining bloodstain during trial)
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question..."
Present Blood Samples Portfolio
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
That proof is right here, in this portfolio!
Judge:
Good gracious, Counsel! Does that portfolio contain the answers to every question posed?
Van Zieks:
...I see you share my interest in claret-coloured liquids, my Nipponese friend. But... Enough. The court demands to see further evidence.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
Which blood sample proves the man you identified was the one shot by the third bullet at the scene of the crime?
Present Music Box Disk sample
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question..."
Present any other sample
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
THIS is the blood sample that proves it!
Judge:
...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Van Zieks:
You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen.
Ryunosuke:
AAARGH! (It has to be a sample that links the bloodstain at the scene to Mr Benedict...)
Iris:
In other words, we need a sample of blood that turned the same colour as that bloodstain.
Ryunosuke:
(Another green sample? ...Did we have one of those?)
Iris:
I think perhaps you should have another look through everything, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
Right. I might need to go over the evidence again. (Where else did we notice a bloodstain?)
Leads back to:
"Enough. The court demands to see further evidence."
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Here it is! This is the irrefutable evidence!
Judge:
I'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see the connection.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Van Zieks:
It seems my learned friend is wide of the mark...again. In fact...he has just shot himself in the foot!
Ryunosuke:
GYAAAAAAGH! (I'll have to try that one more time. Even though my foot is killing me here...)
Judge:
I might remind you, Counsel, of the gravity of the choices you make in this courtroom. Think very carefully.
Leads back to:
"........."
Ryunosuke:
As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question... ...the defendant attempted - deceitfully, admittedly - to reclaim this disk from Windibank's.
Judge:
Which is when the aforementioned Eggert Benedict appeared on the scene, I believe. This man then attempted to purloin the article from the defendant's possession, no?
Ryunosuke:
That's correct, My Lord. I myself was present at the time. It was following this that a minor incident occurred.
Windibank:
But of course, sir. Here is the disk for you.
Benedict:
......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style.
Gina:
Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine!
Benedict:
Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal!
Ryunosuke:
Being a music box disk, it has countless small but sharp metal protrusions over its surface. Those protrusions caused Mr Benedict's finger to bleed. And the resulting smear of blood is still visible on the disk now.
Judge:
Goodness! A bloodstain, is it?
Ryunosuke:
My assistant and I have just analysed the bloodstain here in this very courtroom.
Iris:
Using...my trusty fogger gun!
Ryunosuke:
Yes. And we added the results to this portfolio.
Juror No. 1:
I say!
Juror No. 2:
It's green!
Juror No. 5:
It's exactly the same colour as the blood around the calendar!
Ryunosuke:
The evidence is conclusive! The man calling himself Mr Eggert Benedict, who was in Windibank's earlier in the day... ...is the accomplice who was present at the scene of the crime that same night!
So there was someone else there!
Look at those two brothers now! They're sweating buckets!Oi! Who are you talkin' about? ...It's boilin' in 'ere!
Ryunosuke:
My Lord! It is the opinion of the defence... ...that Mr Eggert Benedict...should be summoned to the courtroom to testify!
Judge:
Hmmm... It would certainly seem that we can ill afford to ignore this gentleman's apparent presence.
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
...This has gone on long enough now. This flagrant ignorance of the mechanics of law.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
Herlock Sholmes, you say? Yes, I've heard the name. The protagonist in a series of short stories for the vulgar classes. A god of detection or some such.
Iris:
...!
Van Zieks:
And now you employ chemical substances devised by this fantastical persona in the highest court in the land? Do you expect us to take you seriously? The samples made by this plaything are not fit to be called evidence.
Judge:
Hmmm...
Van Zieks:
So the bloodstain turned a shade of green. What of it? Here's to you successfully proving that no other blood in the world would turn the same colour.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...well...
Van Zieks:
And pray, do not even think of suggesting that we should take Mr Sholmes's word for it!
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Is he right? Is Mr Sholmes's concoction a load of rubbish?
I don't know... I mean, he is a great detective.What are you talking about?! We can't let him get away with that!
Ryunosuke:
......... (I knew it would come to this. Of course Mr Sholmes's invention isn't going to be recognised by any official body. But...what other choice did I have...?)
Iris:
Hm... I'm just remembering what Father Christmas over there said before. About how he was temporarily suspending the summation examination.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Iris:
In other words... ...the examination isn't over yet, is it?
Judge:
G-Good grief! What did you just say, young girl? 
Iris:
And in a summation examination, the decision as to whether or not the trial continues... ...is in the hands of the six jurors, isn't it?
Van Zieks:
...!
Iris:
So the way I see it... ...it doesn't matter what certain other people think of Hurley's invention. At least, not for now!
Ryunosuke:
Yes! (She's right!)
Judge:
Young lady, you have quite the devious mind!
Iris:
It really just comes down to one thing: Whether these ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...are convinced by what you say, Runo! ...Is that about right, would you say? Or did I misunderstand something?
Ryunosuke:
(Unbelievable! Mr Sholmes's partner is a force to be reckoned with!)
Iris:
Iris Wilson...sharpshooter!
Judge:
After that shrewd precis of the situation from an entirely unexpected source... ...it must be acknowledged that the previous summation examination has yet to reach its conclusion.
Van Zieks:
This is absurd!
Judge:
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court now looks to you for your final leanings in this matter.
Juror No. 1:
...!
Juror No. 2:
...!
Judge:
As proud citizens of Her Majesty's Britain, I'm sure you will come to fair and just conclusions.
Juror No. 3:
...!
Juror No. 4:
...!
Judge:
So then, state your final decisions in turn, please.
Juror No. 1:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 2:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 3:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 4:
Guilty!
Juror No. 5:
Guilty!
Juror No. 6:
Not guilty!
Judge:
Two call guilty, and four call not guilty. Such is the outcome of the summation examination.
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
My Lord, with all due respect, this is an outrage! The prosecution refuses to accept this decision!
Judge:
...On what grounds?
Van Zieks:
If these jurors are persuaded by some half-baked concoction devised by a pretender to real police work... ...then they are too ignorant to be trusted with the judgement of anyone's guilt.
Judge:
I'm sorry, Lord van Zieks, but the outcome of the summation examination cannot be ignored. This trial will continue!
Van Zieks:
Agk......... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
Judge:
...Nevertheless, we find ourselves in a rather awkward situation. The defence has very reasonably requested the subpoena of a new witness. But sadly, I fear that will be impossible.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Judge:
The name the gentleman gave for himself - Eggert Benedict - is quite clearly false.
Ryunosuke:
(I don't believe it! Just when I'd managed to prove the man was there that night...)
???:
...Um... Could, could I say something?
Judge:
...? Who was that, please? Who spoke?
Juror No. 5:
Um...it was me, My Lord.
Ryunosuke:
(Juror number five...?)
Judge:
What have you to say, madam?
Juror No. 5:
If possible...Inspector...
Gregson:
Eh? ...Me, ma'am?
Juror No. 5:
I wonder if you might show the photographic print to me again? The one in which the gentleman is shown.
Gregson:
Ah, right, yes. This one, you mean? Of Mr Benedict?
Juror No. 5:
......... ......... .........Yes... There's no doubt in my mind.
Ryunosuke:
Juror number five, you don't mean to say... You know this man?
Juror No. 5:
Yes, I know him.
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Van Zieks:
No!
Judge:
GOOD GRACIOUS!!! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Juror number five! How on earth...?
Juror No. 5:
I am a communications officer. Stop.
Ryunosuke:
...As we can clearly see...
Juror No. 5:
The gentleman in the photograph is... Stop. ...also a communications officer. Stop. He works in my office. Stop. A very talented operator in fact! Stop. He should be in the communication station now. Stop. Tapping away on the telegraph. Stop.
Ryunosuke:
(This doesn't seem right somehow... I can't put my finger on why, but...it doesn't feel right.)
Iris:
Hm... I suppose we all imagined the accomplice would be some sort of hardened criminal. It's...a bit unexpected to find out that he has a respectable job by day, whatever he gets up to at night.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...I suppose that's it. (I suppose that's why I felt something was wrong...)
Judge:
If the gentleman is at London's communication station, we should be able to subpoena him within the hour. Lord van Zieks, if you please...
Van Zieks:
...Yes, My Lord?
Judge:
Make the necessary arrangements with all haste!
Van Zieks:
As Your Lordship bids.
Judge:
The court will recess for one hour. When the new witness arrives, we shall reconvene to hear the gentleman's testimony. Inspector Gregson...
Gregson:
Yes, My Lord?
Judge:
I should like to hear from you specifically about events at the pawnbrokery on the day in question. Come to my chambers during the recess.
Gregson:
Yes, sir, My Lord.
Judge:
Very well... Court is adjourned until 1:40 p.m.!
To be continued...
17th April, 12:41 p.m.
The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber
Ryunosuke:
Ah, Gina. How are you holding up?
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(I'm starting to feel quite warmly towards her frequent cold shoulders now.)
Iris:
Ginny! Are you alright? Why aren't you saying anything?
Gina:
......... Wot's the point, eh? Why go to all this trouble an' fight so 'ard...for the likes o' me?
Iris:
What?
Gina:
Well you saw it! That picture.
Ryunosuke:
What picture?
Iris:
Ah, you mean this? The photograph taken by Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder. Well, I didn't think it would have captured a scene like this, that's for sure!
Gina:
It's 'opeless. Anyone who sees that's gonna think I did it, ain't they?
Ryunosuke:
Well...I won't pretend it wasn't a bit of a shock when the prosecution first presented it to the court.
Gina:
Surely you've gotta 'ave yer doubts about me now. Ya can't still think I'm innocent.
Ryunosuke:
......... Of course I can.
Gina:
Hmph.........
Iris:
Ginny...why don't you talk to us? Tell us what really happened that night.
Gina:
Eh?
Iris:
Runo's cleverly managed to piece together a lot of new information, but still... ...we'd really like to hear it from you.
Gina:
......... Alright then. It was after we'd 'ad that dinner together at your place, right, Iris? Then we all 'ad a chat up in your office, didn't we?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I remember.
Gina:
After that, I just couldn't get to sleep. So I slipped out an' went down the street to the two-to-one. To Windibank's place. ...I 'ad to know.
Ryunosuke:
If Iris's story was there or not? 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.
Gina:
I dunno wot it's about or nuffin'... ...but if you ask me, there's somefin' in it that Sholmes don't like. Somefin' wot 'e don't want people readin'. So that's why 'e lied to Iris about stickin' it in lug wiv Windibank for safekeepin'. At least, that's wot I thought at the time.
Ryunosuke:
So you broke into Windibank's?
Gina:
I just 'ad to know if it was there or not. I mean, I 'ad no idea all o' that was gonna kick off, did I? I struck the lock and snuck inside. It was dark as you like in there. So I gave the oil lamp on the counter a bit o' wick. And that's when...
What d'you think you're doing?!
AAAAAAGH!
Gina:
I nearly died, I did! And the next thing I knew... ...I'd grabbed the gun off the counter and was wavin' it in the air like...I dunno wot.
Ah...you're the girl who was in here this afternoon. I didn't think pickpockets went in for armed robbery.
The, the mantelscript... 'Ave you got it 'ere? Did Sholmes leave a load o' papers wiv you? A story.
Windibank:
I beg your pardon?
Gina:
'The Hound o' the...' somefin'-or-other. If it's 'ere, I wanna see it!
Windibank:
I'm sorry, young lady... ...but I'd sooner die than relinquish an article belonging to one of my customers.
Gina:
I don't want it! Wot would I do wiv it anyway? I just...wanna see it's 'ere, that's all.
Windibank:
Oh, you want to see it, do you?
Gina:
I wanna know if Sholmes really pawned it 'ere or not. Please! Just let me see it an' I'll go.
Windibank:
......... Oh, very well then. But for pity's sake, stop waving my gun around, would you?
Gina:
So then the old cove unlocked the storeroom door, and we both went inside. And it was there alright. The mantelscript. Sholmes weren't lyin' after all.
Iris:
You did all that just to check for me, Ginny?
Gina:
...Anyway, then there was a bit of a kick-up out in the main bit o' the shop.
Ryunosuke:
The Skulkin brothers arriving on the scene, yes.
Gina:
Wot was that noise? Someone's breakin' in!
Windibank:
Dear me, is there some burglars' convention here tonight that I don't know about?
Gina:
...I think I forgot to shut the door be'ind me. Sorry.
Windibank:
I'd better go and take care of it. Could I possibly have my gun back?
Gina:
Oh, well I'll come wiv ya and-
Windibank:
Now don't be foolish, young girl. You must stay right here. Don't leave this room under any circumstances.
Gina:
An' wiv that, 'e took the gun out of me 'ands and walked back out into the shop. I 'ung back in the storeroom like 'e said, strainin' me ears in the dark to 'ear wot was goin' on. It sounded like they got into a bit of a scrap. I started to think I should 'elp, see. So I was just about to go out the storeroom myself, when...
*BANG!**BANG!*
Gina:
I 'eard a couple o' shots go off. Two, I think. Almost at the same time. And then there 'e was, right at me feet. Lyin' face down on the floor! I was right next to the storeroom door, so I slammed it shut an' locked it quick as ya like.
Ryunosuke:
Because you thought whoever had shot Mr Windibank might come for you?
Gina:
Yeah. So I went to grab the old cove's gun. I figured I'd put up a fight at least. But when I got a better look at 'im, I knew... ...Windibank was a goner. I felt funny in me 'ead all of a sudden. Kind of dizzy. And after that...I don't remember nuffin'.
Ryunosuke:
That must be when you passed out, Gina.
Gina:
......... If...if I 'adn't done wot I done... ...the old cove might still be alive!
Ryunosuke:
Did you tell the police everything you just told us?
Gina:
'Course I did! But they didn't believe a word of it, did they? All they said was, if I kept tellin' lies, it'd make things even worse for me. .........
Iris:
It'll be alright, Ginny, don't worry. Just stay strong a little longer. Runo's about to put the real culprit through the mill!
Gina:
......... That cove wot was there in the afternoon? That Eggert Benedict...
I still remember 'ow 'e looked at me. Like I was nuffin'. 'E...'e was there that night.
Ryunosuke:
We don't know his real name yet... ...but I'm convinced that he's involved somehow.
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Anyway, thank you for telling us what happened, Gina. I appreciate your honesty.
Gina:
You wot?
Iris:
You can leave it all in Runo's capable hands now, Ginny!
Gina:
......... Mr Narra-'Oddo...
Ryunosuke:
Yes?
Gina:
...'Ow come you trust me? I don't get it.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Gina:
I mean, 'ave you forgotten wot 'appened 'ere before? Come on, it was only two months ago. Me and McGilded...we told you a whole pack o' lies. An' you got the bogtrotter off wiv 'em! Even though 'e was a killer!
Ryunosuke:
......... No, I could never forget that.
Gina:
Oh...
Ryunosuke:
(I did what I thought was best at the time. But the pain of that error of judgement doesn't get any easier to bear.) Still, don't forget that I also made you a promise. I told you that I'd be on your side to the bitter end, no matter what.
Gina:
But wot if I'm lyin'?! You could be workin' to get another killer off the 'ook for all you know!
Ryunosuke:
......... I was once in your position, Gina. I was the accused in a trial.
Gina:
You were?
Ryunosuke:
Before I left Japan. I was accused of murder. And strange as it might sound, the circumstances of the crime were pretty damning. I was sure that no one would believe it wasn't me who'd done it.
Iris:
Oh, Runo...
Ryunosuke:
But there was one person who stood up for me. Who believed in me, and was prepared to defend me. My best friend.
Ryunosuke, no one believes in you more than I do. Leave this to me. All you need to do is put your faith in me, and I'll do the rest!
Ryunosuke:
I was so happy, I cried. But even then... ...somewhere inside me, I couldn't help thinking: 'Surely he doesn't really believe in me. Not completely.'
Gina:
...!
Ryunosuke:
But...I was wrong.
As soon as my trial began, it was obvious... ...that he had an absolute, unwavering belief in me. And in turn, I developed an absolute, unwavering belief in him.
Ryunosuke:
Since then, I came to realise... ...if you want someone to believe in you, you have to believe in the other person first.
Gina:
Wot are you sayin'...?
Ryunosuke:
I promise you, Gina, that no matter what happens, I'll keep believing in you. So you don't need to worry. I won't let you down.
Gina:
......... Even though I'm a diver? ...And a no-good liar?
Ryunosuke:
......... You're not like McGilded. I know that.
Gina:
Eh?
Iris:
That's right! You're our friend, Ginny!
Gina:
I-Iris!
Ryunosuke:
We know you better than you think. And we've come to the conclusion that you're someone we can trust.
Iris:
Yes!
Ryunosuke:
That's really all we need to know.
Iris:
Exactly!
Gina:
Um...Mr Narra-'Oddo, I, um... I... *Sniffle, sniffle*
Bailiff:
Defendant Gina Lestrade and her legal representative! Court proceedings are about to resume. Please head into the courtroom immediately!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course! Thank you.
I'd been both a defendant and a defending lawyer in my time. So I knew only too well... ...just how hard it was to put all your faith in another. And I also knew... ...just how hard it was to bear the burden of another putting all their faith in you. (This is it at last. The final chapter. The final battle. Wish me luck, Susato-san... And I hope you're watching over me too...partner!)
17th April, 1:41 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
I hereby call this court to order as we resume the trial of Miss Gina Lestrade. Lord van Zieks, have you successfully subpoenaed the witness?
Van Zieks:
The subpoena was delivered to the communication station where the man works immediately, My Lord. However, the heavy rain has delayed the arrival of his carriage, it would seem.
Judge:
Hm, I see. Then let us turn our attention to Inspector Gregson's precis of the case heard by the court this morning. The glaring omission of the third bullet in your report is a serious blunder, Inspector.
Gregson:
Yes, um, I can only apologise, My Lord.
Judge:
And although the defence's chemical analysis of the blood at the scene makes for a compelling argument... ...I cannot permit such untried methods to be used as evidence in my courtroom.
Iris:
Hmph! It's a big mistake to cross Hurley and me. A very big mistake!
Bailiff:
My Lord! The subpoenaed witness has just arrived in the building.
Judge:
Thank you, Officer. Show him to the stand without delay.
Ryunosuke:
(Mr Eggert Benedict... I didn't expect to be crossing paths with him again so soon. And certainly not like this.)
Judge:
Thank you for complying with the court's subpoena at such short notice, sir.
???:
But of course, My Lord. As an upstanding member of London society, it is my pleasure to oblige.
Judge:
Now, kindly state your name and occupation for the record.
Graydon:
Ashley Graydon, communications officer.
Juror No. 5:
Mr Graydon and I both work at London's central communication station.
Graydon:
Now perhaps somebody would kindly explain what all this is about?
Van Zieks:
You were apprised of the situation by the court officer on your way here, I presume.
Graydon:
Yes, I was. Something to do with a murder that took place at a pawnbroker's on Baker Street. And some nonsense about me having been there on the night in question.
Van Zieks:
That is the accusation, indeed.
Graydon:
This really is beyond a joke, you know.
Judge:
Very well. Without further delay, the court will hear your testimony now, Mr Graydon. You will respond to the accusation made against you under oath.
Graydon:
Gladly, My Lord. Gladly.
Witness Testimony
- The Accusation -
Graydon:
Naturally, I have occasion to make use of pawnbroking services from time to time.
But are you seriously suggesting I colluded with these thugs to break into the place on the night of the murder?
...I have no intention of admitting to such an outrageous accusation.
Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.
Some scaramouch detective's homebrewed tincture can hardly be taken as serious evidence.
Judge:
So...you deny the accusation completely, do you?
Graydon:
I must say, I am dismayed. For the highest court in the land to be swayed by this self-professed detective's toy...
Van Zieks:
It was the will of the jury. And our great British justice system demands that the jury's will is upheld.
Graydon:
Then it would seem we have the misfortune of a most inept assembly of jurors today.
Juror No. 1:
...! By golly!
Graydon:
How long am I expected to be detained here?
Judge:
If, following the defence's cross-examination, your involvement in this matter has not been established... ...you will be free to leave immediately.
Graydon:
Good. Then I shall be away in time for afternoon tea. Some small consolation at least.
Judge:
Let us not hold up Mr Graydon any longer than necessary, Counsel. Proceed with the cross-examination.
Ryunosuke:
So...we meet again, Mr Eggert Benedict. Or is it Mr Graydon?
Graydon:
......... My apologies. You are...?
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer. We have met.
Graydon:
If you say so. Ashley Graydon. Enchanté. So...
Ryunosuke:
Agh!
Graydon:
...I trust we can conclude this quickly.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (But I'm NOT holding your flashy hat while we do.)

Ryunosuke:

Ryunosuke:
Yes, we even met in the very pawnbrokery where the crime took place on the afternoon of the day in question. Though of course...you introduced yourself by a different name at the time.
Graydon:

Ryunosuke:
It was Mr Eggert Benedict, I believe. Tell me, what made you-
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
The witness is here to testify about events that took place that night.
Ryunosuke:

Van Zieks:
He is under no obligation to answer such unrelated questions.
Ryunosuke:
You can't be serious!
Graydon:
...Thank you. Because I certainly do not feel inclined to answer such an inappropriate question.
Ryunosuke:
(So he's going to be evasive, is he? In an effort not to give anything away. This could be tricky...)
Graydon:

Graydon:
But are you seriously suggesting I colluded with these thugs to break into the place on the night of the murder?

Ryunosuke:
Have you seen these two men before?
Graydon:
This pair? ...No. I don't associate with criminals.
Ryunosuke:
(Said by a man who introduced himself as 'Eggert Benedict'...)
Graydon:
I'd like to know who I have to thank for this. Who made this outlandish accusation against me?
Van Zieks:
The young lawyer there in the black.
Graydon:
This is a farce! Whose idea was it to permit an outsider to work in a British court anyway?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Graydon:
Well, needless to say...
Graydon:
...I have no intention of admitting to such an outrageous accusation.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Where were you at around one in the morning on the night in question, sir?
Graydon:
That is past the hour at which I would normally retire. Certainly... ...I was not in the company of these rapscallions.
Ryunosuke:
You're able to prove that?
Graydon:
.........
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Listen carefully, my learned Nipponese friend... ...for you appear to be under a gross misapprehension on this point.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Van Zieks:
The witness maintains he was not at the scene of the crime. He has no obligation to prove his absence. If your accusation is that the witness was present at the scene... ...the obligation lies with you to prove your assertion.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
You will fulfil that obligation before putting any more unreasonable questions to the witness.
Ryunosuke:
(A silent victory wiggle. Thanks.)
Graydon:
Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Blood was found at the scene of the crime. There's no question of that. Mr Sholmes's chemical analysis has positively identified the substance as such.
Graydon:
But I am not the only human to have blood running through my veins, am I? How can you be sure that the blood is mine? It could equally be the blood of one of these two miscreants.
Ryunosuke:
Every individual's blood has a slightly different composition, it seems. Mr Sholmes's chemical is able to differentiate different blood samples by-
Graydon:
Spare me the science lesson! ...Who is this Sholmes character anyway?
Ryunosuke:
Oh. I, I assumed all Londoners would know the name. He's a grea- Well, a renowned detective.
Van Zieks:
So, even you are unable to bring yourself to say 'great detective'.
Graydon:
A great detective, you say? Tsk! Now we're in the realm of fairy tales, are we? The counsel for the defence thinks a British courtroom is an appropriate place for fairy tales, does he?
Pursue Nash Skulkin
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Do you have something to say about that, Mr Skulkin?
Ringo:
Eh? Wot? Me?
Ryunosuke:
...No, the Mr Skulkin next to you.
Gregson:
Right, I've had it up to here with this! How many times have I gotta tell you?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I know. You're not 'Big Bruv Sulky'. Mr Nash Skulkin!
Nash:
Eh? Cor blimey, guvnor! You wot?!
Ryunosuke:
Is it not the case that when Mr Graydon just spoke, a thought went through your mind? Would you care to share that thought with the court?
Nash:
Eh? Me thoughts? I dun 'ave none o' them! It must've been 'im!
Ringo:
You wot?!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Nash Skulkin! ...Answer the question, please. What went through your mind when Mr Graydon just spoke?
Nash:
Nuffin'! Honest, guv! Nuffin'! I, I woz just thinkin'... ...if 'e waves 'is arm around like that much more, it'll open up the wound again, that's all!
Ryunosuke:
What wound?
Nash:
Where 'e took the bullet, o' course! It woz only two days ago. It ain't gonna be 'ealed up yet! So I woz, um... Well, ya know... I woz worryin' for 'im, and... ......... Oh, 'ell's bells!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Graydon! Did you hear that?
Graydon:
What?
Ryunosuke:
Your comrade is worried about you, it seems. ...On account of your injured arm.
Graydon:
......... My Lord.
Judge:
Yes, Mr Graydon?
Graydon:
I have no idea what these two wretches are talking about. Certainly, I shouldn't be expected to answer anything in relation to their mindless insinuations.
Judge:
Hmmm...
Ryunosuke:
We know that someone other than the victim was hit by a bullet at the scene of the crime two nights ago. And from the height of the bullet hole in the wall, that person was likely hit in the upper arm or thereabouts.
Graydon:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps you'd allow a court official to examine your arm, sir? The left arm that you're currently clasping with your right hand, as if in pain!
Graydon:
......... No. ...I refuse.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Graydon:
You have shown no evidence whatsoever that links me to these common thieves. Accordingly, I am not obliged to permit any such invasion of my privacy! As I've already said, I'm completely uninvolved in all this. I've never had anything to do with the pawnbrokery where this fellow was killed whatsoever! I take offence at the insinuation that I was in any way involved!
Judge:
Hm...you claim to have had nothing whatsoever to do with Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery?
Ryunosuke:
My Lord! The defence would like that last statement to be added to Mr Graydon's formal testimony.
Judge:
Very well, Counsel. Continue with your testimony, My Graydon.
Graydon:
.........
Removes statement "Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.", adds statement "The bottom line is, I've never had anything to do with the pawnbroking establishment where the man was killed!"
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Iris:
Argh! This is so unfair! That chemical test is based on solid science! Hurley and I know what we're doing!
Ryunosuke:
The trouble is, unless the technique can be independently verified... ...we'll never get beyond this man's flashy stick-waving.
Graydon:
Granted, it is a very colourful alchemy. Perhaps it would make a good souvenir for your uneducated friends back home in the East.
Ryunosuke:
(Something riled him there. Just for a moment, Mr Graydon let his feathers get ruffled...)
Graydon:
But a souvenir is all it's good for.
Graydon:
Some scaramouch detective's homebrewed tincture can hardly be taken as serious evidence.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Don't forget, sir, that Mr Herlock Sholmes is the most famous detective in the world.
Graydon:
And the most famous detective in the world tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, hm?
Ryunosuke:
Erm, well, um... (Oh no! I can't think how to answer that!)
Van Zieks:
I once saw the world's most famous swindler thrown into jail. He allegedly told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but...what turned out to be a pack of lies.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Graydon:
Quite. Now... ...as you are no doubt aware, the central communication station is the heart of this country's information network. My work there is of paramount importance. And you have kept me from it for long enough already.
Graydon:
The bottom line is, I've never had anything to do with the pawnbroking establishment where the man was killed!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Never had anything to do with it? You forget that I was there, Mr Graydon! On the very afternoon of the incident!
Graydon:
...Obviously, I am not a complete stranger to the pawnbroker's. I'm currently on the lookout for an armchair to furnish my study.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
No! You were there to redeem an article!
Graydon:
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Pursue Tobias Gregson
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Do you have something to add, Inspector?
Gregson:
Eh? Come again, sunshine?
Ryunosuke:
You were there, too, in fact, weren't you, Inspector? That afternoon.
Gregson:
......... Well yes, I do remember meetin' yourself in the pawnbroker's that afternoon. You, your young Japanese assistant, and the accused were all present, as I recall.
Ryunosuke:
And at that time, this witness, Mr Graydon, was trying to acquire a particular article...
Gregson:
Um...well now...
Ryunosuke:
...!
Gregson:
I'm afraid I don't remember too clearly.
Ryunosuke:
What?! But, but you must!
Gregson:
I'm not going to lie and pretend I remember somethin' that I don't.
Ryunosuke:
...! (What's going on here?)
Iris:
Gregsy showed us a picture before, didn't he? You know, from the cameras that Hurley installed in Windibank's.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, of course.
Judge:
Indeed. And the gentleman pictured bears a striking resemblance to the witness, I must say.
Ryunosuke:
Exactly! Which proves that Mr Graydon was in the shop on the afternoon in question!
Graydon:
At no point have I denied that fact.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Graydon:
I merely entered the shop to peruse the articles on sale and have a word with the broker. Nothing more.
Gregson:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(This makes no sense. I understand why Mr Graydon might be trying to cover his tracks... ...but why would Gregson be trying to avoid giving testimony about what happened?)
Leads back to cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Graydon:
You must be confusing me with somebody else. I wasn't there for any such purpose.
Ryunosuke:
But, but the redemption article!
Iris:
That won't get you anywhere, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
Iris! ...What do you mean?
Iris:
Mr Windibank never wrote the names of his customers on his redemption tickets. So you can't prove the ticket was his.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (Of course... She's right.)
Iris:
I'm afraid... ...you're going to need to produce some irrefutable evidence here. Otherwise he'll never admit to being there.
Ryunosuke:
Hm...irrefutable evidence...
Present Music Box Disk
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Have you ever seen this disk before, Mr Graydon?"
Before correctly pursuing Nash Skulkin
Ryunosuke:
(That's all he's going to say on the matter, is it?)
Iris:
What do you think, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
I think he has no intention of telling us anything. He's well aware that the less he says, the less chance he has of giving himself away.
Iris:
Hm... The complete opposite of Hurley, then. He seems to think that the more he says, the better.
Ryunosuke:
I need to find a way of getting more information out of this man somehow... (But compared to the bungling burglars beside him, he seems as innocent as a child.)
Iris:
Or perhaps the Skulkin brothers might be the key here?
Ryunosuke:
Oh... (Could they be somehow...?)
Iris:
Remember, if you don't prove this witness has some connection to the incident here, he'll be free to leave.
Ryunosuke:
I know. I can't let that happen. (Let's listen to those statements again and see if there's any way I can make one of them tell us more.)
After correctly pursuing Nash Skulkin
Ryunosuke:
(That's all he's going to say on the matter, is it?)
Iris:
What do you think, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
I think he has no intention of telling us anything. He's well aware that the less he says, the less chance he has of giving himself away.
Iris:
Hm... The complete opposite of Hurley, then. He seems to think that the more he says, the better.
Ryunosuke:
Well, at least I managed to prise a little more information from these witnesses' lips. All thanks to the Skulkin brothers...
Iris:
Yes! They were the key to it after all!
Ryunosuke:
So he says he had nothing to do with Windibank's... (Well, we know that's not true.)
Iris:
Perhaps now would be a good time to have a proper look through the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
Good idea. You never know what tiny scrap of information could become a valuable weapon...
Ryunosuke:
Have you ever seen this disk before, Mr Graydon?
Graydon:
......... Why? Is it supposed to mean something?
Ryunosuke:
This disk was, until the day of his murder, in pawn in Mr Windibank's shop. It was redeemed by the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade that afternoon. However... ...somebody mysteriously appeared to try to take it from her. And that somebody was you, of course. Wasn't it, Mr Graydon?
Graydon:
As I have reiterated numerous times now...you are mistaken. That was not me. I've never seen that disk before in my life.
Ryunosuke:
It may have escaped your notice, but there is a small smear of blood on the disk.
Judge:
Ah yes. Resulting from an abrasion of the thumb, perhaps?
Ryunosuke:
That's right. The surface of the disk is covered in hundreds of tiny metal bumps. In the skirmish to acquire the disk, the thumb of the person who tried to take it suffered minor lacerations.
Graydon:
...!
Ryunosuke:
So! While the disk bears the remnants of that skirmish in the form of this smear of blood... ...the thumb of the person in question must bear the remnants also. In the form of a scratch!
Judge:
Good gracious! Indeed it must!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Graydon!
Graydon:
...!
Ryunosuke:
You refused to allow a court officer to examine your arm before. Are you now going to refuse to allow us to examine your thumb? Because I have no doubt that it bears a small scratch consistent with the smear of blood on this disk!
Graydon:
...! ......... Well well... ...it would seem I underestimated you.
Judge:
What, what is the meaning of this?
Ryunosuke:
So you admit it now? You admit you have a scratch on your thumb from when you attempted to take the disk from the defendant?!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! ...Well, Mr Graydon?
Graydon:
...It would appear there has been something of a misunderstanding here. I did not attempt to take the disk, as you put it. No, quite the reverse.
Ryunosuke:
What are you trying to say?
Graydon:
It's really quite simple, you see. The disk was mine from the outset. Is there some crime in taking an item that you own out of pawn?
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Van Zieks:
It would seem, Mr Graydon... ...that in this piece of evidence, my learned friend has established a link between yourself and the incident. Accordingly...you will tell the court everything you know about this disk now.
Graydon:
...As you wish. Though I'm quite sure it has nothing whatsoever to do with the pawnbroker's murder.
Witness Testimony
- The Disk -
Graydon:
There's a note on the disk saying, 'For McGilded', but the item belongs to me.
The redemption ticket was stolen from me by the accused - that filthy gutterling - on the day in question.
I proceeded at once to the shop in order to explain my situation and redeem my article.
In the end, of course, the disk was taken by the police.
In other words...I had absolutely no reason to break into the shop later that same night.
Judge:
Did I hear you correctly, sir? 'McGilded', you say? The famous London philanthropist? Who perished in this very courtroom two months ago after being acquitted of a distinctly messy murder?
Graydon:
Yes, My Lord. The one and the same.
Judge:
Good Lord! Mr Graydon! Are you saying that Mr McGilded and yourself were acquainted?
Graydon:
......... Yes. That's correct.
Judge:
Ordaaar! ...Well. I certainly didn't expect to hear that name uttered here in my courtroom again.
Ryunosuke:
(According to what Gina told us, this disk was placed in pawn on that fateful night two months ago. McGilded himself gave instructions to deposit it at Windibank's.)
Iris:
It's funny that Mr Graydon here is claiming the disk belongs to him then, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
In all likelihood, he's lying. (So he appeared that afternoon at Windibank's in order to get his hands on McGilded's disk for some reason...)
Judge:
Counsel, you will commence your cross-examination, please.
Cross-Examination
- The Disk -
Graydon:
There's a note on the disk saying, 'For McGilded', but the item belongs to me.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Would you care to explain how this belongs to you?
Graydon:
As you will observe, a communications officer such as myself commands a fine salary.
Judge:
You are certainly...exquisitely dressed, sir.
Graydon:
So you see, I have little need to make use of the services provided by the pawnbrokery trade. However, I did once find myself in difficulties having misplaced my purse whilst on an errand. Which is why I pawned my fine black overcoat to the broker in question.
Ryunosuke:
You claim that was your overcoat?
Graydon:
...Obviously. And in my haste, I clean forgot... ...that the music box disk was in its pocket.
Van Zieks:
And yet there is a note on it that reads, 'For McGilded'.
Graydon:
I am a collector of rare and unusual music box music. I first met Mr McGilded at a gentlemen's club in the city, and was interested to discover... ...that he shared my penchant in that area.
Judge:
So the disk in question...
Graydon:
It's a pre-production sample. I promised to let Mr McGilded hear it.
Van Zieks:
But then you forgot that it was in the pocket of the overcoat you were forced to pawn.
Graydon:
Yes, exactly.
Iris:
Gina didn't mention any of that in her testimony two months ago, did she?
Ryunosuke:
No. Because McGilded had threatened her to keep her mouth shut. Which means that if we dig too deeply here... ...it's going to expose Gina's perjury.
Iris:
Oh dear...this is complicated, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
(Let's leave it alone for the time being...)
Graydon:
The redemption ticket was stolen from me by the accused - that filthy gutterling - on the day in question.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So you're saying that Miss Lestrade lifted the ticket from your pocket or bag?
Graydon:
That's right. Despite being mindful of danger when walking in the insalubrious areas her kind frequent.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Miss Lestrade did no such thing!
Graydon:
Well of course you would take that stance. But the girl is a regular offender.
Ryunosuke:
You came to the pawnbrokery that day prepared with all the information you needed to identify the defendant. You were looking for her. That's what brought you to Windibank's. To get your hands on Mr McGilded's disk!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
My learned friend is a veritable font of nonsense.
Ryunosuke:
N-Nonsense?
Judge:
I concur with the prosecution. Counsel, you will refrain from conjecturing in this way. Is that clear?
Ryunosuke:
Yes...My Lord.
Graydon:
Then I will continue with my testimony, for what possible use it can be...
Graydon:
I proceeded at once to the shop in order to explain my situation and redeem my article.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Had you ever been to Windibank's before?
Graydon:
Only once for the purposes of pawning something. But, like many, I enjoy browsing in such establishments.
Van Zieks:
So when you noticed that the pickpocket had taken your ticket, you chased after her. Is that correct?
Graydon:
Yes, that's right. I didn't notice at first, of course. Such is the art of the pickpurse. But when I did, I headed to the pawnbrokery at once. In order to reclaim my coat before the thief could. I was merely trying to recover what was rightfully mine in the first place.
Ryunosuke:
(Argh! He can say what he likes because he knows we have no evidence to contradict him on this!)
Graydon:
In the end, of course, the disk was taken by the police.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it was taken by Inspector Gregson here, wasn't it?
Graydon:
That's right. This was the very man. Apparently the police are collecting anything that has a connection to Mr McGilded. As evidence. That's what the inspector said, at least, as he seized my disk. And thanks to the skirmish with that wastrel, I snagged the end of my thumb at the same time.
Pursue Tobias Gregson
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Is something wrong, Inspector?
Gregson:
Erm, well, erm... What d'you mean?
Ryunosuke:
The last remark Mr Graydon made in his testimony seemed to trouble you in some way.
Gregson:
Eh? No. No it didn't. It's nothin'. Leave it alone.
Ryunosuke:
Let me ask you this, Inspector: Why is Scotland Yard gathering Mr McGilded's possessions?
Gregson:
I can't tell you somethin' like that, sunshine!
Van Zieks:
What is it, Inspector? Investigative secrets?
Gregson:
Yes. Exactly. You should know all about that!
Van Zieks:
Magnus McGilded, who died so...unexpectedly after his trial two months ago. A man renowned throughout the capital for his great contributions to public life. Yet he had a dark side, too...
Ryunosuke:
...!
Gregson:
Where are you goin' with this, van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
I suppose the police are dealing with the aftermath of his nefarious activities, are they?
Gregson:
...That's enough! Coppers like me have duties to carry out that we're not at liberty to talk about. That's all you need to know.
Van Zieks:
Duties conferred by Lord Stronghart, I presume. The Lord Chief Justice appears to have great faith in you, Inspector.
Gregson:
......... The bottom line is, if you wanna get more out of me... ...you're gonna need Lord Stronghart's pawprint first!
Van Zieks:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(What's all this about? It's like there's something going on between Gregson and Lord van Zieks here...)
Judge:
Well, it would appear that the inspector has revealed all he is at liberty to reveal. Mr Graydon, let us return to your testimony.
Graydon:
Gladly, My Lord.
Leads back to cross-examination
Van Zieks:
And the disk in question is this disk here?
Graydon:
Yes, it is.
Van Zieks:
Scotland Yard have indeed been gathering items believed to have been the property of McGilded. Presumably to aid their investigations in some way.
Graydon:
Not something I would be aware of. I really didn't know the man well, anyway. After all, I'm merely a communications officer with a penchant for music boxes.
Ryunosuke:
(...And flamboyant poses.)
Graydon:
In other words...I had absolutely no reason to break into the shop later that same night.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
But perhaps you'd seen something of value among the forfeited items?
Graydon:
No, not at all.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Van Zieks:
A valuer was brought in by the police to assess everything in the shop. Without exception, every article on the shelves was common-or-garden bric-a-brac.
Ryunosuke:
In that case, it's clear... ...that you broke into the shop later that day in order to recover Mr McGilded's disk.
Graydon:
Have you not been listening, man? Even if I had wanted to recover the disk... ...you may recall that it had been seized by the police that afternoon! It was no more in the shop that night than I! As I keep saying, I simply had no reason to break in.
Ryunosuke:
......... (So there was nothing of McGilded's left in the shop that night. Nothing this man might have been after. I wonder if that's really true...)
Iris:
Runo, if you have some evidence... ...then let him have it! I'm dying to see that irritatingly assured expression of his crumble!
Present Pawnbroker's Ticket (Box)
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Leads to:
"This disk was deposited at Windibank's on Magnus McGilded's instructions."
Ryunosuke:
(McGilded slipped the disk into his coat pocket and had it deposited at Windibank's. Then, when he realised he was going to be arrested on suspicion of the omnibus murder... ...he threatened Gina and forced her to take the redemption ticket.)
Iris:
There's no doubt about it, that witness is lying through his pearly white teeth!
Ryunosuke:
The police were obviously after anything left behind by McGilded as well. That's why Inspector Gregson ended up taking the disk into custody that day.
Iris:
But Gregsy's being very strange about all this.
Ryunosuke:
There must be a reason for that, I'm sure. I just don't know what it is. (For now, I need to focus on exposing the fact that Mr Graydon is lying in his testimony.)
Ryunosuke:
This disk was deposited at Windibank's on Magnus McGilded's instructions. You knew that, and you went there with the intention of obtaining it for yourself.
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Conjecture again. And in any case, the disk was taken into custody by the police that afternoon. The witness had no reason to visit the pawnbrokery again that night!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry, my learned friend...but that's not true.
Van Zieks:
What?
Ryunosuke:
Mr McGilded had another article in pawn at Windibank's... ...as this second pawnbroker's ticket proves!
Graydon:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
There were two articles belonging to Mr McGilded in Windibank's pawnbrokery. And the reason you broke into the shop that night was to recover the second one... ...together with your two accomplices, the Skulkin brothers!
Graydon:
Agh!
Judge:
Hmmm... This is the second ticket, is it?
Van Zieks:
What had the man deposited?
Ryunosuke:
The article description reads, 'one small box'.
Judge:
A rather vague description, it seems to me.
Graydon:
Are you suggesting that I broke into the pawnbrokery with these...clowns in order to steal some trinket box?
Ryunosuke:
I believe there are adequate grounds to suspect that you did.
Graydon:
This is absurd! Why on earth would I do such a thing? Once the article had been forfeited, I could simply walk into the shop and purchase it. There would be absolutely no need for me to resort to theft!
Ryunosuke:
...! (That's a good point.)
Judge:
Hm, indeed. The witness makes a solid argument.
Iris:
So that means that for some reason... ...this Graydon fellow needed the small box that very night, does it?
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
It's time to put an end to this nonsense, My Lord.
Judge:
Could you be a little less cryptic, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
I do hate to ruin my learned friend's argument, but the truth is quite incontrovertible. On the night in question, no small box was taken from Windibank's pawnbrokery. And rest assured, the prosecution can prove it.
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Judge:
Good gracious!
Van Zieks:
Inspector, show the photographic prints to the court, if you please.
Gregson:
Yes, sir!
Ryunosuke:
(What prints?)
Gregson:
These prints were taken from one of the detective's security cameras.
Iris:
Ah, Hurley's Red-Handed Recorders again!
Van Zieks:
As previously explained using this plan of the shop layout... ...the victim's establishment was furnished with automatic cameras in two locations. One was set to capture the counter where Mr Windibank received his customers... ...and the other was set to capture the shelves on which articles were placed for sale once forfeited.
Gregson:
Accordin' to the information on this ticket... ...McGilded's small box had been forfeited already. Two days before the incident, at 9 p.m. on 13th April to be precise. Which means it would have been on the shelves of forfeited items in the shop front. Now, what I have here is a print taken by one of the cameras about two hours before the incident. That's at 11 p.m. on 15th April.
Judge:
Hm, the victim certainly had a very full shop, it would appear.
Gregson:
And then here we have another print... This one was taken about two hours after the incident.
Judge:
I see. So we have two pictures to compare. Though I must say that placing them side by side leaves me cold. Dear me, that's starting to make my head ache.
Gregson:
Obviously, at Scotland Yard we considered theft as one possible motive in this case. We explored the possibility that something had been taken in addition to the victim's life.
Judge:
So your men have already compared these two prints thoroughly, Inspector?
Gregson:
Yes, sir! We counted every single item in each of these two photographic prints. And the Yard's conclusion is that exactly the same number are present in both!
Judge:
Hmmm...
Van Zieks:
In other words, nothing was taken from the pawnbrokery on the night in question. And my learned friend's assertion is nothing more than a hopeful fantasy!
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAARGH! (I don't believe it! If I could have just shown that he'd stolen McGilded's pawned box... ...I might have been able to break him down at last.)
Iris:
You know what, Runo... ...I've been thinking. I wonder if these two photographs really are exactly the same.
Ryunosuke:
What...?
Judge:
So, Counsel...in the light of the evidence put forward by the prosecution, what is your position? It seems that in fact, on the night in question, nothing was stolen from the victim's establishment. Do you accept the prosecution's assertion?
Ryunosuke:
(I don't know... Could there be some hidden discrepancy in these two photographic prints somewhere?)
There's no discrepancy
Ryunosuke:
(However much I look at these two prints, I just can't see that anything went missing.) Yes, My Lord. I can see nothing wrong with the photographic evidence put forward.
Graydon:
.........
Judge:
Very well. In that case, the matter is settled.
Iris:
No! Wait, Runo! There's something out of place with these two prints, I'm sure of it.
Ryunosuke:
Iris!
Iris:
What about that trick that we just learnt? We should use that now to really examine these two prints thoroughly.
Ryunosuke:
Alright! Just, just uncross your eyes...please!
Judge:
Counsel... ...I've finally become accustomed to the wide-eyed star that so frequently occupies your countenance. But that crossing of your eyes is another matter entirely! I'm afraid I must penalise you for it.
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAARGH! (This could be our chance to fight back. I suppose I should explore all avenues before I just accept the prosecution's position. Could there really be some hidden discrepancy in these two photographic prints somewhere?)
Point out a discrepancy
Leads to:
"........."
Use a piece of evidence
Ryunosuke:
Before I give my answer, My Lord, I'd like to try something if I may.
Judge:
Try something? What do you mean, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
I'll need to use a certain piece of evidence from the Court Record to identify the discrepancy.
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
I'm not entirely sure I follow. Which piece of evidence do you intend to use to help you identify a discrepancy between the two prints?
Present Stereoscope
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"I'd like to use this device, My Lord."
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The piece of evidence I intend to use, My Lord...is of course... (What am I doing? There's something in the Court Record whose sole purpose is to view pairs of photographs. Do you think - just maybe, Ryunosuke - this might be the time to pick that particular item out?)
Judge:
Dear me, Counsel... ...you do blow hot and cold, don't you?
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...sorry, My Lord. I'd like to try that again.
Judge:
I'm sure you would. Very well then, let's hear your revised answer.
Leads back to:
"Which piece of evidence do you intend to use to help you identify a discrepancy between the two prints?"
Ryunosuke:
I'd like to use this device, My Lord. To view the two prints stereoscopically.
Juror No. 3:
Oooh! Yes! You've caught the bug at last! You can't resist it, can you? You've got the cross-eyed compulsion!
Ryunosuke:
(Juror number three. What a surprise.)

Come on, Runo! Let's put the pictures in place and see what this wonderful contraption shows us! ...There we go. Now, look through the eyepiece!

You must identify the location in question for the court, Counsel. Indicate the precise location of the discrepancy of which you speak.
Present round box on right
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Granted, these two prints are almost identical."
Present anywhere else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Obviously the discrepancy...is here!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
I must thank my learned friend. His answer has clarified the situation greatly. There is indeed a discrepancy here. Between our respective powers of reasoning.
Ryunosuke:
......... Let me guess... My powers of reasoning come up short?
Judge:
It would appear you're learning, Counsel. But not quickly enough.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (But I'm sure it's there. It's subtle, but there's a difference between those two prints. I know there is!)
Iris:
Don't give up, Runo! You can do this!
Leads back to:
"So, Counsel...in the light of the evidence put forward by the prosecution, what is your position?"
Ryunosuke:
Granted, these two prints are almost identical. However, there is one minor discrepancy between them.
Gregson:
WHAT?!
Ryunosuke:
When you view the two pictures stereoscopically... ...a single area stands out as being different: the location of this small box.
Van Zieks:
Let me... Wait... Un-Unbelievable!
Judge:
By Jove, you're right! How extraordinary!
Ryunosuke:
What this tells us is very simple! Mr McGilded's small box was indeed not stolen from Windibank's on the night in question. However, there can be no doubt... ...that somebody picked up this particular box and then returned it to its place on the shelves!
Judge:
Are you suggesting that the small box originally deposited by Mr McGilded is in fact...
Ryunosuke:
Yes! The very same small box I just identified in those photographic prints!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Mindless guesswork! What if it was?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
So a box was moved on the shelf. Nothing was stolen. Which means quite simply...that nothing has changed.
Ryunosuke:
That, that may be true, but... (Alright, McGilded's box wasn't stolen then... ...but doesn't the fact that it was moved like that change things?)
It changes nothing
Ryunosuke:
No, you're right. It changes nothing.
Graydon:
.........
Ryunosuke:
...! (Is that a smile on Mr Graydon's lips? Wait a minute... What am I saying? Of course it changes things!) ...Or so I thought at first! But actually, I'd say it changes everything! ...Well?
Van Zieks:
Well! It's changed your mind, certainly. And that capricious behaviour earns you a penalty, my learned friend.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (I really should have thought that through better.)
Judge:
But, but Counsel... ...if nothing was stolen and all that happened was that this box was moved slightly... ...how can that possibly alter the state of affairs here in the courtroom now?
Leads to:
"The crucial point is the fact that what was moved was a small box."
It changes everything
Ryunosuke:
I believe...this changes everything about the case.
Van Zieks:
How can that possibly be?
Leads to:
"The crucial point is the fact that what was moved was a small box."
Ryunosuke:
The crucial point is the fact that what was moved was a small box. In other words, we have to consider what might have been inside that box.
Van Zieks:
What are you suggesting?
Graydon:
.........
Ryunosuke:
I'm suggesting that we need to examine that box. As soon as possible! A vital piece of evidence is sitting on the shelves at Windibank's as we speak!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
That won't be necessary! Some little box belonging to a man who died two months ago can't possibly be relevant to this trial!
Judge:
The court does not uphold your objection, Lord van Zieks. Bailiff! Arrange for an officer to go to Baker Street at once. Obtain the small box in question and bring it back here for further examination!
Judge:
We should have a report within half an hour. I think perhaps we should recess for a short while until the evidence is brought forth.
Van Zieks:
To be hoodwinked by such a farce... Hmph. Disappointing.
Judge:
I beg your pardon, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
This is nothing but a smoke screen. A Nipponese speciality, it would seem.
Ryunosuke:
What are you trying to say?
Van Zieks:
My learned friend has persisted with the same line of reasoning from the very beginning. That this witness's intent was to steal an article belonging to Mr McGilded from the pawnbrokery. Yet common sense tells us...that none of the articles have value enough to be worth stealing in the first place.
Graydon:
Exactly! It would be beyond absurd to break into a place for the purpose of stealing such commonplace property.
Judge:
Hmmm...
Van Zieks:
If Your Lordship recalls, Mr McGilded perished two months ago, immediately after the conclusion of his trial. A trial in which he was found not guilty. A trial in which it was established he was the upstanding member of society his reputation implied, in fact. So I propose a toast. To my learned friend, and his most...insightful defence.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Graydon:
The articles this upstanding member of society pawned were entirely ordinary. A black overcoat that just happened to have a music box disk in one of its pockets. And a small box. I assure you, I wouldn't accept even if the man tried to make a gift of such things to me.
You know, that does make rather a lot of sense.
It's not as if it was gold or jewels, is it? Though goodness knows, Mr McGilded was rich enough!
But you can't deposit cash at a pawnbrokery. I'm quite certain of that.
Judge:
...The prosecution's argument is undeniably compelling.
Van Zieks:
It is incumbent on the defence now to bolster its argument. To explain what possible significance these commonplace articles pawned by this fine citizen could have!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Judge:
Well, Counsel? Is your argument in fact demonstrable? Are you able to show proof that the disk or the box are in any tangible way related to this case?
Ryunosuke:
Well...erm... .........
Iris:
What's the matter, Runo? We know that they're related, don't we? They're both vital pieces of evidence!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course. You and I both know that. We know McGilded's true character. And we know the disk is significant, even if we don't know why. But if we explain all that to the court at this point... ...we'll have to acknowledge that McGilded's acquittal two months ago was a mistake. That the defence's argument was flawed. Based on false information.
Iris:
Oh no!
Ryunosuke:
And that would mean... ...admitting that Gina committed perjury.
Iris:
But Ginny...
Ryunosuke:
(Could it be that van Zieks knows? Is that why he's doing this now? Because he anticipated everything?)
Iris:
But maybe... ...this could be a great opportunity for us.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? What do you mean, Iris?
Iris:
Well, what is it that you always say, Runo? 'Sooner or later, the truth comes out. Every time!'
Ryunosuke:
...! (Alright, the exact significance of the things that McGilded deposited with Mr Windibank... ...is something that only Gina can explain to the court. But if I put her on the stand to testify about that... ...it could critically damage our chances of winning this case. What's the right thing to do here?)
Have Gina testify
Leads to:
"My Lord, the defence would like to make a proposal."
Leave it
Ryunosuke:
(No, I can't get Gina to testify about this. If I did, she'd be forced to admit that she is guilty of a serious offence already. And for a pickpocket like her, that would surely be the nail in the coffin as far as this trial is concerned.)
Iris:
So you're not going to call Ginny, then?
Ryunosuke:
Well, to be honest, I was on the verge of deciding not to. But...we have to uncover the truth here. And in order to do that, we might have to suffer a few consequences along the way.
Iris:
Runo!
Ryunosuke:
(In other words, there's only one course of action for us to take here.)
Leads to:
"My Lord, the defence would like to make a proposal."
Ryunosuke:
My Lord, the defence would like to make a proposal.
Judge:
Oh? What proposal, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
While the court awaits the arrival of Mr McGilded's small box... ...I would like to call the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade, to the witness stand.
Judge:
The defendant? To what end?
Ryunosuke:
It's to do with the various articles deposited at Windibank's by Mr McGilded, My Lord. Miss Lestrade has information relating to them. I believe it would be beneficial for the court to hear what she has to say. It will prove the significance of the articles in question once and for all!
Van Zieks:
Well well...things are becoming interesting. I presume you've considered the implications of the testimony you're proposing? In particular, the impact it will have on the accused's standing...and indeed your own.
Ryunosuke:
......... I have.
Judge:
Lord van Zieks? Would you care to explain that last remark?
Van Zieks:
The prosecution accepts the defence's proposal. I move to interrupt the cross-examination of the current witness and hear from the accused herself!
Judge:
......... Very well, if you have no objection. So, the court will now hear the testimony of the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade. You witnesses currently in the stand may step down until further notice.
Graydon:
Then I shall bid you good day.
Van Zieks:
Wait. You, sir, shall remain in the stand while Miss Lestrade testifies.
Graydon:
......... As you wish.
Ryunosuke:
(Alright then, Gina, it's time... I know this will be hard, but please! Put your faith in me here!)
Iris:
Good luck, Runo...
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
The articles that Mr McGilded had deposited in Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...are intimately related with the omnibus case, the trial of which was heard in this courtroom two months ago.
Judge:
Yes... And I remember this young lady being brought before me in that trial as well.
Ryunosuke:
That's right, My Lord. Her testimony helped to establish the innocence of the defendant, Mr McGilded.
Gina:
.........
Van Zieks:
The omnibus case was...intriguing, to say the least. And now here we all are again. The same players in that trial facing each other once more. A twist of fate perhaps...my Nipponese friend.
Ryunosuke:
......... Allow me to recap the events of two months ago. An old brickmaker was stabbed to death in an omnibus running along London's winter streets. Apart from the victim, there was only one other person in the carriage: Mr McGilded. Naturally, he was the prime suspect for the murder. But as the trial progressed, another possibility emerged. That the murder in fact took place above the defendant's head on the roof deck... ...with the body then being dropped through the skylight into the carriage below. It was Miss Lestrade whose testimony brought that possibility to light. At the time of the incident, Miss Lestrade was concealed under a seat in the carriage... ...hoping to pick the pockets of unsuspecting passengers. Then, immediately after the trial, having being acquitted of the murder... ...Mr McGilded died in this very courtroom, in the most extraordinary of circumstances.
Van Zieks:
A mystery that remains unsolved even now, two months on. As indeed does the omnibus murder itself.
Judge:
Be that as it may... ...I recall neither the disk nor this 'small box' being mentioned in the course of those proceedings.
Ryunosuke:
Miss Lestrade...
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Would you tell the court now, please? What really happened in the omnibus two months ago, I mean.
Gina:
......... I dunno wot ya mean. I already said all of wot I know!
Ryunosuke:
And what about everything you told us yesterday from inside your prison cell?
Gina:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Please, Miss Lestrade. This is extremely important.
Gina:
B-But...
Van Zieks:
Remember, little girl... ...if it transpires that you wilfully withheld information in the trial two months ago... ...the Home Office will seek to prosecute you for perjury.
Gina:
...!
Van Zieks:
And naturally, you will lose all credibility as a witness. Although, let's face facts... ...you have little credibility to lose.
Gina:
.........
Iris:
Ginny, don't listen to him! Please! You have to trust Runo now!
Gina:
I-Iris...?
Iris:
We're on your side!
Gina:
......... Alright then. ...I'll talk.
Ryunosuke:
It's the right choice, Gina.
Van Zieks:
Well, it would seem that my learned friend... ...is hell-bent on bringing the entire courtroom down about his ears. ...So be it.
Judge:
I must confess that I'm struggling to understand what on earth is happening here. However, it would appear that Mr McGilded's pawned articles and that extraordinary case of the omnibus... ...harbour secrets of which we have been hitherto unaware.
Gina:
.........
Judge:
So, Miss Lestrade, you will now give your testimony before the court about the events of two months ago. You will reveal the truth, a commodity sorely lacking in your original statements!
Ryunosuke:
(This is it, then. Everything's going to come out. Like van Zieks said... ...this could bring the whole courtroom down about my ears. But as a lawyer, I'm prepared to take that risk.)
Witness Testimony
- The Real Truth of the Omnibus Case -
Gina:
Truth is, that brickmaker cove was in the cabin o' the omnibus the whole time.
When the Irishman dragged me out from under the seat, I saw that disk on the floor.
All of a sudden, I 'eard a scream from over me 'ead, an' that pair on the roof deck went off to call the slops.
That's when McGilded slipped the driver some tin to do a run to the pawn shop round about.
...He threatened me not to snitch. Not to say nuffin' to no one about wot I'd seen or 'eard.
Judge:
Good grief, this is outrageous! What you've just told the court bears almost no resemblance to your testimony two months ago!
Van Zieks:
As you say, My Lord.
Judge:
Then, then there's every chance... ...I may have adjudicated in error in McGilded's trial! It sounds very much to me as if the man deliberately deceived this court... ...in an effort to cover up the most wicked of schemes!
Van Zieks:
Without doubt, Your Lordship is correct. A great injustice was done in this courtroom two months ago. The actions of the accused in that trial, of this witness...and of my learned friend are entirely inexcusable!
I don't believe it!
The whole trial was a farce? It was all lies?
That McGilded fellow was rotten to the core! Just like that pickpocket!
Don't forget that lawyer from the East! They were all in on it together!
Gina:
Yer wrong, the lot o' ya! Mr Narra-'Oddo - the lawyer there - 'e didn't know nuffin' about it!
Juror No. 1:
Humbug!
Juror No. 2:
I don't think so. Are we really expected to believe that?
Juror No. 4:
He really stitched everyone up, didn't he? What an operation, to get the man off scot-free!
Juror No. 5:
Unforgivable! Stop. The lies have to stop! Stop.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the defence made a terrible error of judgement. I intend to take full responsibility and suffer whatever consequences are deemed appropriate. ...However! It's imperative that the court allows the witness to elaborate on her testimony. Because the true significance of McGilded's pawned articles must be brought to light!
Van Zieks:
......... Very well...my learned student friend...
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
Given the depths of calamity you have just plunged yourself into, this may well be worth hearing.
Judge:
Words fail me. This situation is...utterly deplorable. Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!
Judge:
I will decide upon your fate following the conclusion of this trial.
Ryunosuke:
Of course, My Lord.
Gina:
Blimey, Mr Narra-'Oddo...
Judge:
Now, Counsel. Proceed with the cross-examination!
Cross-Examination
- The Real Truth of the Omnibus Case -
Gina:
Truth is, that brickmaker cove was in the cabin o' the omnibus the whole time.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
And you were hiding in the cabin at the time as well, weren't you, Miss Lestrade? If I remember rightly, in the storage compartment underneath one of the seats?
Gina:
Yeah, that's right. It's pitch-black under there, so ya can't see nuffin' at all.
Pursue Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson (if not already pursued; before all statements have been pressed without pursuing)
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Is there something you'd like to share with the court, Inspector Gregson and Mr Graydon?
.........
Ryunosuke:
INSPECTOR!!! MR GRAYDON!!!
Gregson:
WHA-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Blimey! You tryin' to give me a heart attack?
Ryunosuke:
You have been whispering to each other for quite some time now. Tell us, what is the discussion about?
Gregson:
Discussion? With this fella? Pull the other one, sunshine! You think I've got anythin' to talk about with a shady gent like this?
Graydon:
And I have nothing to say to this uncouth detective after he deprived me of that disk that was rightfully mine.
Ryunosuke:
(But they've clearly been talking the entire time I've been cross-examining Gina. It's as if they've been negotiating.)
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
You will kindly refrain from talking amongst yourselves while the witness is giving testimony.
Gregson:
Yes, um...sorry, My Lord.
Ryunosuke:
(What WERE those two talking about?)
Judge:
Miss Lestrade, continue with your testimony, please.

Judge:
Now, in your testimony two months ago... ...I feel certain that you claimed Mr McGilded was the sole passenger, did you not?
Van Zieks:
False testimony, My Lord.
Gina:
That's...that's wot 'e told me I 'ad to say.
Ryunosuke:
But it's important that you tell us the truth now. Were Mr McGilded and the victim acquaintances?
Gina:
I dunno. But I did 'ear 'em talkin' a lot.
Ryunosuke:
What were they talking about?
Gina:
Well I couldn't 'ear too well. But if I 'ad to say... ...I think it was about money or somefin'. They kept talkin' about 'buyin&#39;' and 'not buyin&#39;'.
Judge:
Hm, perhaps business dealings of some kind...
Gina:
Well anyway, they got louder an' louder. It started to sound like a proper fight. I was pretty scared by then. I 'ardly dared to breathe. And then, all of a sudden... ...I 'eard a noise like someone keelin' over on the floor. It was bloomin' loud an' all.
Judge:
And I believe you let out an involuntary scream?
Gina:
Yeah. That's wot gave me away.
Gina:
When the Irishman dragged me out from under the seat, I saw that disk on the floor.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Was the disk you saw this disk?
Gina:
Yeah...I reckon it probably was. It was right next to the cove lyin' on the floor.

Judge:
Could this disk have belonged to the victim perhaps?
Gina:
I dunno, but McGilded picked it up pretty smartish. An' then 'e sat the cove wiv the knife in 'is belly up on the seat.
Ryunosuke:
What did he say to you at that time?
Gina:
'E told me not to say a word about wot I'd seen or 'eard to no one. About the disk an' all. I was dead scared. The way 'e was lookin' at me, I thought... ...if I didn't go along wiv it, I'd get stuck wiv that knife, too.
Judge:
Hmmm...
Gina:
Then 'e started askin' me a load o' questions. Like wot me name was an' where I lived an' that. 'E asked me about bein' a diver, too.
Ryunosuke:
But after a while, what had happened in the carriage was noticed?
Gina:
Yeah, that's right. First there was a kind of rappin' noise.
Gina:
All of a sudden, I 'eard a scream from over me 'ead, an' that pair on the roof deck went off to call the slops.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
There were two gentlemen occupying the seats on the roof deck, I believe?
Gina:
That's right. They must've looked down through the skylight an' noticed the cove wiv the knife in 'is guts. When they screamed, the driver pulled up the 'orses an' McGilded got me out o' sight.

Leads to:
"Thank you, Miss Lestrade."
Judge:
Out of sight? Where?
Gina:
Back under the seat where I started off. Once the carriage came to an 'alt, the two coves from the roof ran off to fetch the slops.
Van Zieks:
If they immediately left to fetch the police, it would appear they were entirely unrelated to the incident.
Judge:
Hmmm...
Ryunosuke:
So that left McGilded, the driver and you still at the scene.
Gina:
Yeah. Only the driver didn't know I was there cos I was under the seat. I 'eard the cabin door open, an' a voice from outside.
Judge:
The driver, yes... He also testified in the trial, I believe. A fellow who went by the name of Beppo, if memory serves.
Ryunosuke:
What did McGilded and the driver say to each other?
Gina:
'I dunno wot 'appened,' an' stuff like that mainly.
Gina:
That's when McGilded slipped the driver some tin to do a run to the pawn shop round about.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
That pawn shop obviously being Windibank's on Baker Street.
Judge:
Ju-Just a moment, Counsel! Do, do you mean to tell me... ...that the driver gave false testimony in that trial as well?!
Van Zieks:
Perhaps the excursion to the pawnbrokery slipped his mind when he was in the stand.
Judge:
Indeed, Lord van Zieks!
Gina:
McGilded took off 'is coat an' gave it to the driver. 'E folded it up, all careful like, before 'andin' it over. When I saw 'im do that, I remember thinkin'... ...that coat an' wot's in it 'as gotta be worth a few bob.

Van Zieks:
Which included giving false testimony in court two months ago?
Gina:
Yeah, that's it. And there was one other thing 'e said.
Van Zieks:
Which was?
Gina:
'E told me I'd 'ave to 'ang on to the ticket from the pawn shop. An' make sure not to lose it.
Judge:
The ticket...? Well I never!
Gina:
Said that if 'e didn't show up to get the ticket off me before two months passed... ...I 'ad to go to the pawn shop and pay the money to keep it in lug. To stop it bein' forfeited. 'E left me wiv some brass to pay for it.
Judge:
But really... ...why on earth would Mr McGilded have done such a thing? Depositing his overcoat with a pawnbroker before the arrival of the police... It makes no sense at all.
Ryunosuke:
There would seem to be only one logical explanation, My Lord. What McGilded had the driver deposit at Windibank's was something he didn't want the police to see. Something very important, that he needed to hide at all costs.
Judge:
...!
Gina:
Anyway...after that, 'e let me go. So I legged it before the coppers showed up.
Before pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson
Ryunosuke:
(Well done, Gina. It can't have been easy to tell the truth like that.)
Iris:
Ginny's really put her faith in you, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, and to thank her, she'll have to face a charge of perjury once this trial's over. (So I need to use the time we have now to get as much information out of her as possible.)
Iris:
It's time to really go for it! Press her on every statement!
Ryunosuke:
I, I suppose I should...
Iris:
Oh! And another thing...
Ryunosuke:
What's that?
Iris:
Take a look at those two. Isn't it strange that they've been whispering to each other the entire time?
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, that is strange. It looks like they're having a secret discussion about something... I'm not sure if I'm completely comfortable with that. I wonder if there's anything I can do about it...)
After pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson
Ryunosuke:
(Well done, Gina. It can't have been easy to tell the truth like that.)
Iris:
Ginny's really put her faith in you, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, and to thank her, she'll have to face a charge of perjury once this trial's over. (So I need to use the time we have now to get as much information out of her as possible.)
Iris:
It's time to really go for it! Press her on every statement!
After pressing all statements (without pursuing) and pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson:
Judge:
Thank you, Miss Lestrade. Thank you, Counsel. I've heard enough. I believe we now have a reasonable understanding of what actually transpired on the omnibus.
Van Zieks:
It would appear on that night two months ago, a negotiation was taking place on the omnibus. A negotiation concerning this disk. However, matters did not run smoothly. When the parties involved began to quarrel over price, McGilded took what he wanted by force... ...at the expense of the other man's life.
Ryunosuke:
Which proves my point! The disk is clearly extremely valuable in some way! (Although I don't understand why as yet.)
Van Zieks:
And two days ago, precisely two months after the omnibus incident... ...McGilded's coat and its contents were due to be forfeited.
Gina:
I didn't know wot I should do wiv the ticket. I mean, the cove died right after 'is trial. I knew that.
Van Zieks:
So you decided you would try to claim the articles as your own.
Gina:
Well why not, eh? They were only gonna be forfeited! Why shouldn't I 'ave got 'em? Anyway, ya can't blame me for thinkin' about it. Thinkin' ain't no crime!
Judge:
Miss Lestrade, it would appear Mr McGilded was prepared to kill in order to take possession of this disk. Do you know why that would be?
Gina:
Eh? I ain't got a clue! But I reckon it must be worth a fair bit o' brass. 'E was probably gonna sell it. An' ya can't blame me for thinkin' that! Thinkin' ain't no crime!
Judge:
Hmmm...
???:
My Lord!
Bailiff:
The evidence Your Lordship requested has been located and is ready for the court's inspection, sir!
Ryunosuke:
(The mysterious little box, deposited by McGilded two months ago... There's no doubt in my mind that it's a key piece in this far-reaching puzzle!)
To be continued...
Judge:
So this is the article in question, is it? The 'small box' deposited with the pawnbroker by Mr McGilded two months ago.
Ryunosuke:
...And on the night of Mr Windibank's murder... ...the only item on the shelves that was touched by whoever broke in to the shop.
Iris:
Quick, quick! Let's open it and see what's inside!
Judge:
Good gracious! This is no ordinary box, it seems!
Ryunosuke:
(Wow! ...Although in truth, I had an inkling that might be the case.)
Van Zieks:
...It would appear that the box houses a miniature music box movement.
Graydon:
.........
Judge:
Then...is it too much to expect...?
Van Zieks:
I think it would be reasonable to assume that it is a device for the playback of this disk, My Lord.
Judge:
So, here we have the means to play back Mr McGilded's disk, deposited at Windibank's at much the same time.
Van Zieks:
Not strictly correct, My Lord. It was not McGilded's disk. It was the disk of his victim in the omnibus.
Judge:
But why, for heaven's sake? Are we to understand that the brickmaker was trying to sell this music box disk to Mr McGilded?
Ryunosuke:
......... I believe the answer will become clear if we listen to the music on the disk, My Lord.
Judge:
Yes, very well. Let the court now listen to this curious disk at last.
Gregson:
Hold it!
Gregson:
Wait! ...My Lord!
Judge:
Good grief! What is the meaning of this, Inspector?
Gregson:
The music box and the disk are, um... Well they're unrelated to the case! No, no need to spoil the sombre atmosphere in the courtroom with some silly bit o' music...
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
This disk may very well have motivated the culprit in this case to commit murder! Clearly there's every chance that it's fundamentally important to understanding what happened!
Van Zieks:
The prosecution has no objection.
Gregson:
But, but no! That piece of evidence is police property now! You can't-
Van Zieks:
Clearly Scotland Yard has some vested interest here. But it is policy of this prosecutor to leave no avenues unexplored. And you, Inspector, have no jurisdiction here to prevent that from happening.
Gregson:
GA-AAAAAAAARGH!
Judge:
No further delays, please. Play the disk!
...........................
Judge:
Wh-What on earth...? That's certainly not what I would call music.
Ryunosuke:
(No... It's just the same note playing over and over again in an irregular sequence...)
Judge:
Hmmm...
Graydon:
Ha ha ha ha ha...
Judge:
Mr Graydon?
Graydon:
This, this really is priceless! After all that, the music box is broken!
Ryunosuke:
Broken?! (It, it can't be, can it?)
Graydon:
Well obviously! In fact, I wouldn't be surprised... ...if the officer sent to fetch it didn't drop it on the way back to the courtroom.
Judge:
Well, with much regret... ...I feel the court must accept that this music box offers little in the way of clues.
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
Are you ready to move on, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
(Come on...! Yes, alright, it does sound as though it's completely broken, but...is it?) Could this 'music' emanating from the music box possibly be a new clue?
No way
Ryunosuke:
I agree that it doesn't appear to be relevant, My Lord.
Graydon:
.........
Ryunosuke:
...What prompted that triumphant wiggle?
Graydon:
Nothing in particular.
Ryunosuke:
Really?! Or was it because that 'music' is in fact a very significant clue?!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
You never learn, do you? When you speak, you must mean what you say. ...Or be prepared to suffer the consequences!
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Judge:
Erm... Am I to understand that you do indeed consider this repetitive monotone to be relevant somehow? 
Leads to:
"It's an abomination, Counsel! Mere noise!"
It could be a clue
Ryunosuke:
I believe that it could be relevant, My Lord.
Judge:
Good Lord! But, but how can it be?
Leads to:
"It's an abomination, Counsel! Mere noise!"
Judge:
It's an abomination, Counsel! Mere noise! I fail to see how it can have any meaning whatsoever.
Ryunosuke:
(It does sound strange, I agree. But there's one thing bothering me... While Graydon stands there chortling victoriously... ...the inspector beside him has a rather telling expression on his face. It's as if Gregson recognises the sound. As if he's familiar with it somehow... And that's making him appear extremely on edge.)
Van Zieks:
If that's the stance of the defence, my Nipponese friend, answer me this...
Ryunosuke:
Oh!
...........................
Van Zieks:
Just what relevance do you propose this woeful chiming has on this case?
Ryunosuke:
......... It's the defence's belief that the sound emanating from this music box is...
Broken
Ryunosuke:
Clearly the music box is broken in some way!
Van Zieks:
.........
Graydon:
.........
Judge:
Counsel... ...I feel you are perhaps floundering in your non-native tongue, but 'broken' is tantamount to irrelevant here.
Van Zieks:
Indeed. And here's to your own irrelevant noise, my learned friend!
Ryunosuke:
Naaargh! (The music, or whatever you want to call it, has to be relevant somehow. ...Which might actually be the point!)
Van Zieks:
Let's see if you grasp the question better next time around...
Leads back to:
"..........................."
An unusual genre of music
Ryunosuke:
It could be an unusual genre of music that none of us are familiar with!
Van Zieks:
.........
Graydon:
.........
Judge:
Counsel... ...would you care to elaborate on that remark?
Ryunosuke:
Well, it...it could be a new style of music that's about to take the world by storm, for example!
Judge:
I think not, Counsel. Such monotonous nonsense could be pleasing to no one's ear, surely.
Van Zieks:
Well said, My Lord. And here's to my learned friend seeing that remark's true meaning!
Ryunosuke:
Naaargh! (The music, or whatever you want to call it, has to be relevant somehow. ...Which might actually be the point!)
Van Zieks:
Let's see if you grasp the question better next time around...
Leads back to:
"..........................."
Not supposed to be music
Leads to:
"Just because this is a music box, it doesn't necessarily mean the sounds we're hearing are music."
Ryunosuke:
Just because this is a music box, it doesn't necessarily mean the sounds we're hearing are music.
Graydon:
...!
Ryunosuke:
(Look at that. The smile vanished from Graydon's lips as soon as I said it. I'm on the right lines here. I must be!)
Iris:
Hehe, making deductions based on how people react to what you say... You're acting just like Hurley, Runo!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
The sounds we're hearing aren't necessarily music? Well, now that you've told us what they are not... ...I'm sure the court would like to hear what they are. Do enlighten us, my Nipponese friend.
Ryunosuke:
...! Well, um...
Van Zieks:
Surely you have an idea in mind? Because if not... ...it will be the death of your ill-formed argument!
Graydon:
Exactly. The music box is clearly broken. Refusing to accept that fact is pure foolishness!
Ryunosuke:
(They've got me! I don't know what the answer is...yet!)
Iris:
Um, Runo... ...I've just examined the music box very thoroughly... ...and I'm fairly certain that it's not broken at all.
Ryunosuke:
Really?!
Iris:
Really. The way it's been made, it can only produce a single note anyway.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you, Iris!
(Alright, well if the music box isn't broken... ...it must mean that the sounds it's producing have some significance that isn't musical. ......... Ah! Could it be...? Is that what these sounds are?!)
Iris:
Something's just struck me, Runo. I feel like recently - in the past few hours even... ...I've heard another sound very much like the one this music box makes.
Ryunosuke:
......... (Yes, it's a familiar sound.) Actually, Iris... ...I was just thinking exactly the same thing.
Judge:
I'm going to have to press the defence for an answer. If your assertion is that the sound produced by this music box is not in fact music at all... ...then what the devil is it, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
(All the evidence we've seen so far... All the testimony we've heard... It's all pointing to one single answer now!)
Van Zieks:
The prosecution demands that my learned Nipponese friend presents proof now! Tangible proof of this latest, wild speculation!
Ryunosuke:
......... Alright then. (This could be the best chance I'm going to get to fight back in this trial. And if I'm right, it's going to join all the dots together!) The evidence that explains the true nature of the sounds on this music box disk is...
Present Today's Paper (after examining picture on back)
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Today's paper, Counsel?"
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Obviously it's this!
Judge:
I'm afraid to say, Counsel... ...that you were being rather optimistic with that leading 'obviously' there.
Ryunosuke:
......... If I'm honest, as I thumped my hands down just now... ...I had an inkling that it was going to hurt me more than the bench.
Van Zieks:
Well. At least one of your 'inklings' was correct, then.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Iris:
That arrhythmic tinging sound the music box makes is definitely familiar somehow.
Ryunosuke:
It's almost like some sort of code... The question is how to show that the tinging sound has a connection to this case. (Perhaps I should have a good look through all the evidence in the Court Record again.)
Iris:
I'm going to have a good look through the Court Record again too, I think!
Leads back to:
"The evidence that explains the true nature of the sounds on this music box disk is..."
Judge:
Today's paper, Counsel? The headline is 'Pawnbroker Perishes in Pickpurse Plunder!' ...Hardly supportive of your cause.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...no, My Lord. I was hoping you'd look a little further down the page...
Judge:
Further down? 'Ministry Mole? Classified Secrets May Have Been Leaked Overseas From Ministry of Justice'... Yes, this is a very serious matter, being investigated at the highest level, I understand.
Van Zieks:
I have heard that international transmissions along supposedly secure lines are somehow being intercepted... ...and leaked to various other countries.
Ryunosuke:
And presumably...those transmissions are in the form of wired telegrams?
Van Zieks:
Of course.
Ryunosuke:
Juror number five! Your input, please!
Juror No. 5:
......... Stop. Oh! M-Me, sir? Whatever is the matter?
Ryunosuke:
You told the court before that you worked at the same communication station as Mr Graydon, did you not?
Juror No. 5:
Y-Yes, that's correct.
Ryunosuke:
And the particular station where you work... ...deals with government communications and newspaper reports?
Juror No. 5:
Oh, yes! We're not your run-of-the-mill communication station at all. Our work is extremely important.
Ryunosuke:
Then tell me...is this not a very familiar sound?
Juror No. 5:
Hm...? ......... You, you don't mean to say...? Is it...?
Ryunosuke:
That's right, madam. It bears more than a passing resemblance to the sound made by your telegraph machine as you tap it. I believe it's called...Morse code?
Juror No. 5:
But... I don't believe it!
Ryunosuke:
Now correct me if I'm wrong...but when it comes to leaking telegrams from government departments... ...there could be nobody more perfectly placed than a highly skilled communications officer!
Van Zieks:
Are, are you suggesting that the music box disk... ...contains stolen government secrets in Morse code?!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar! Please, everyone! Ordaaar!!! But this... This is... This is high treason, Counsel! Deserving of capital punishment!
Juror No. 6:
Too much new wocabulary! What is this 'treason'? And what is 'capital punishment'?
Ryunosuke:
(The sorts of words I'd half expect you to know...)
Judge:
For our sovereign government's confidential information, hostile nations would surely pay almost any price!
Ryunosuke:
Yes...and on that night two months ago... ...that was the very negotiation that was taking place inside the omnibus!
Van Zieks:
But in the end, McGilded perished, and the all-important disk lay unclaimed in the pawnbrokery...
Judge:
My word!
Ryunosuke:
In which case... ...whoever stole that information in the first place must surely have been beside himself with worry. Because if the disk were to be discovered before it found its way out of the country...
Judge:
...It would reveal an act of high treason punishable by death!
Ryunosuke:
So the culprit had no choice but to retrieve it. And in order to do that... ...he would have to gain entry to the pawnbrokery illegally in the middle of the night. Because the article left behind by Mr McGilded would incriminate him too much if it got into the wrong hands. Isn't that right...Mr Graydon?!
Graydon:
......... You, you think I've been stealing government secrets? Preposterous! Absolutely preposterous!
Judge:
So, in response to the defence's accusation... ...you claim complete innocence, do you?
Graydon:
Well of course I do! I've had to stand here in silence while that pretentious foreign lawyer has been prattling away!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Then by all means...counter the charges, sir!
Graydon:
...!
Van Zieks:
The prosecution demands the witness testifies...in response to the accusations brought by the defence!
Graydon:
......... ...Delighted, I'm sure.
Judge:
The witness is reminded that the crime under scrutiny in this trial is the murder of the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank. That being a most flagitious offence, for which the law of this land sanctions a capital punishment. But the heinous act of high treason is no less serious a crime. ...I urge you to bear that in mind as you testify, Mr Graydon.
Graydon:
.........
Judge:
So then, let us proceed. You may-
???:
Hold it!
Nash:
Ya gotta let us 'ave a rabbit an' pork 'ere, guvnor! We got things to say!
Judge:
I, I beg your pardon? Who do you think you are?
Nash:
Name's Nash Skulkin! Occupation is...profeshnal baddie.
Ringo:
Name's Ringo Skulkin! But we ain't baddies enough to sell out our muvverland!
Nash:
That's right. We're wot they call...
...the Three Skulkin Bruvvers! .........
Gregson:
Bad timin', fellas! Very bad timin'.
Witness Testimony
- Graydon's Counter -
Graydon:
A mere communications officer couldn't possibly steal confidential government information!
Besides, the sounds produced by that music box aren't even Morse code!
It was some low-class brickmaker negotiating with McGilded anyway, was it not? I've no relation to the man!
Nash:
Look, all we dun is break into the gaff the other night like wot 'e told us to do!
Ringo:
If we'd known there woz dodgy gov'ment secrets involved, we wouldn't 'ave touched it!
Ryunosuke:
.........
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
......... Erm...Mr and Mr Skulkin...
Nash:
One mister'll do, guvnor. ...Wot's up?
Judge:
Do I take it that you now admit to the crime? That on the night in question, you did indeed gain entry to the premises illegally? And moreover...you did so as a party of three, in collaboration with Mr Graydon here?
Nash:
.........
WE DID, GUV, WE DID!!!
Judge:
Quieten down, please. ...What say you to that, Mr Graydon?
Graydon:
...I have no idea what these two ruffians are referring to.
Nash:
You little rotter, gettin' us mixed up in all this monkey business! You never said nuffin' about no gov'ment secrets! It woz s'posed to be a straight-up job!
Ringo:
An' wot about the geezer whose shop it woz, eh? Poor old bloke didn't 'ave to die, did 'e?!
Graydon:
Agh...!
Ryunosuke:
(Nice to know who your friends are...)
Graydon:
Whatever these men say, I deny the accusations.
Judge:
Indeed... Well, I certainly wasn't expecting this little music box to become so significant in the proceedings. However, as it has, I will admit it into the Court Record as evidence.
The small music box has been entered into the Court Record.
Examine evidence
Small Music Box
Mechanism in top compartment
Ryunosuke:
This is the mechanism that turns the bumps on the disk into sound...isn't it?
Iris:
Yes, the 'movement'. It's all thanks to the comb with its teeth that are plucked by the passing bumps. Usually, the teeth on the comb are different lengths so that each one produces a different tone. But this comb is very strange. All the teeth are exactly the same length.
Ryunosuke:
Well...what does that mean?
Iris:
It means that no matter which tooth is plucked by the passing bumps, the music box will make the same sound. I've never seen a music box like it before.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it is strange. A music box that can only play a single note... (There has to be some significance to that, surely.)
Music box disk
Ryunosuke:
See how the 'For McGilded' disk sits in the music box the man deposited at Windibank's. It couldn't be a more perfect fit.
Iris:
So there's no question then! The disk was designed to be played in this music box.
Ryunosuke:
Yet despite that, the sounds it produces are neither musical, nor do they appear to have any meaning. (It just doesn't make any sense...)
Iris:
I wonder... ...if perhaps there's more to this music box than meets the eye. Maybe we haven't discovered all its secrets yet.
Knob on bottom
Ryunosuke:
...Oh!
Iris:
What is it, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
I've, I've just noticed something about this music box... It looks like the bottom of it opens up as well.
Iris:
Ah! You're right! Well come on then! What are you waiting for? Let's open it!
Ryunosuke:
Alright then...here goes...
Iris:
Look at that! There's another movement on the underside!
Ryunosuke:
So...does that mean... ...you can set another disk to play back on this side?
Iris:
Yes, I think so. And it looks like the two movements are linked together.
Ryunosuke:
They're linked?
Iris:
So if you had two disks, they would both play back at the same time.
Bottom compartment (after examining knob on bottom)
Ryunosuke:
Who'd have thought there would be a second movement on the underside of the box?
Iris:
And this movement is like the other one. The comb's teeth are all the same length.
Ryunosuke:
So...this movement also only produces a single tone, like the other one?
Iris:
Yes, it must do. Except that the length of the teeth on the two combs isn't the same. So the single tone produced by this movement will be different to the single tone we've already heard.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Iris:
Basically, each movement can only produce a single note...
Ryunosuke:
...but the notes they produce are different. (A music box that can only play two tones...)
Cross-Examination
- Graydon's Counter -
Graydon:
A mere communications officer couldn't possibly steal confidential government information!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So is this newspaper headline accurate? Government communications ARE being intercepted?
Graydon:
How could I possibly know?
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean by that?
Graydon:
Any important government communications are handled by high-level officers. By specialists. General members of staff in the station where I work would never be entrusted with sensitive information.
???:Oh no! Stop. Must say something! Stop.
Ryunosuke:
(Let me guess...) Juror number five!
Juror No. 5:
We regular communication station officers aren't as lowly as you're being led to believe! A team of us are responsible for setting up and testing the telegraphs used by the ministry. And Mr Graydon is the team leader!
Ryunosuke:
That's...fascinating.
Graydon:
.........
Juror No. 5:
Graydon is highly skilled operator! Stop. Currently in presence of idol! Stop.
Judge:
Hm... So you had access to the equipment used for these confidential communications, Mr Graydon...
Graydon:
Well, what of it?! The transmissions are always made behind closed doors so they can't be heard! And in any case, all messages are sent enciphered. Normal employees couldn't possibly understand them!
Juror No. 5:
Oh no! Stop. Must say something! Stop. Mr Graydon regularly attends meetings with ministry technicians and the ministry communications team! He assists them in ensuring that there are no errors in important international communications! And he's received the top prize at the Cipher-Cracking Convention five years in a row now!
Ryunosuke:
That's...fascinating.
Graydon:
.........
Juror No. 5:
Graydon is highly skilled operator! Stop. Currently in presence of idol! Stop.
Graydon:
Well your idol would appreciate it if you'd keep your mouth shut!
Ryunosuke:
(She should really pick her idols more carefully...)
Graydon:
I, I tell you this lawyer's accusations are completely unfounded!
Graydon:
Besides, the sounds produced by that music box aren't even Morse code!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
They're not?!
Graydon:
To anyone with a brain, that would be blatantly apparent on listening to that music box for even a few seconds.
Ryunosuke:
......... Of course, of course.
Van Zieks:
Surely it can't be that my learned friend is unfamiliar with Morse code?
Ryunosuke:
(Ouch. He looks genuinely shocked at my ignorance.)
???:Ha ha ha!
Juror No. 5:
I would be more than happy to demonstrate the basics for you, sir.
Ryunosuke:
A, a lesson...here in court?
Juror No. 5:
Morse code is a continuous series of two distinct tones.
Ryunosuke:
Tones, you say?
Juror No. 5:
Yes. A short 'dot' and a long 'dash'. By combining those in different ways, you construct letters.
Ryunosuke:
I see...
Juror No. 5:
For example, this is 'A'... And this is 'B'... But when you listen to the sound produced by this music box, you only hear one tone, don't you?
Ryunosuke:
But, but it sounds so similar! The rhythm of it is the same and everything!
Van Zieks:
But there's no discernible meaning to this apparently random sequence of sounds. So your assertion is fundamentally flawed. This is not Morse code.
Ryunosuke:
NOOOOOOOO!
Graydon:
Ha ha ha ha ha... Really, you shouldn't be so surprised. What did I tell you? That music box is nothing but a worthless piece of scrap! Perhaps you might consider studying your subject matter before casting aspersions in future!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... Stop. Nothing to say, but... Stop.)
Iris:
Oh, it's so frustrating, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Iris?
Iris:
I mean, if the government secrets were somehow being leaked using the music box... ...so many other things would slot into place so nicely.
Ryunosuke:
(Could there still be something I haven't considered...? Would it really be impossible to use this music box somehow to play back Morse code?)
It seems impossible
Ryunosuke:
The defence will concede that the music box is irrelevant. ...For the time being.
Graydon:
'For the time being'? Such optimism. Too debonair to admit defeat, are we?
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...those gesticulations are really starting to grate.)
Iris:
Hm...it can't be Morse code unless is [sic] has two distinct tones...
Ryunosuke:
(Perhaps I should examine that music box in a little more detail.)
Graydon:
.........
Leads back to cross-examination
Give it a try
Ryunosuke:
There's still every possibility that this music box was instrumental in the leaking of government secrets. That's the belief of the defence, at least.
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Does it please you in some way, my Nipponese friend, to repeat the same line of argument ad infinitum? It's already been established that to be Morse code, two tones are required. Dots...and dashes.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I'm well aware of that.
Van Zieks:
Then, what?
Judge:
Well, it would appear the defence has a hypothesis to put forward.
Graydon:
...!
Judge:
You had better present your idea at once, Counsel. How do you propose that this music box, which appears to produce only a single tone... ...could have been used to cipher secret messages into Morse code?
Examine knob on bottom, then present bottom compartment (before correctly presenting McGilded Case Notes)
Ryunosuke:
Judge:
Good gracious! What am I looking at here? Another movement on the underside of the music box?
Van Zieks:
What?
Graydon:
...!
Ryunosuke:
It appears, My Lord, that the two movements are linked together. In other words, you can put two disks in this music box... ...and the sounds of both will play back at the same time!
Judge:
Good heavens!
Ryunosuke:
As the court has heard, Morse code comprises of two tones: a short 'dot' and a long 'dash'. With a second disk in place, this music box could be used to generate Morse code and convey a message!
Graydon:
This is beyond a joke!
Ryunosuke:
I'm sorry?
Graydon:
This poor excuse for a lawyer has absolutely no evidence to support his claims!
Van Zieks:
Though of course... ...if my learned friend were able to present the court with the second disk, that would be another matter. ...Well?
Ryunosuke:
I, I can't...at the moment.
Judge:
Hmmm...
Van Zieks:
And may I remind the court that as the witness has pointed out... ...he was not the one in the omnibus with McGilded two months ago, striking a deal over the disk or disks.
Judge:
Indeed. That was Mr Mason, the brickmaker.
Graydon:
Exactly! I had nothing whatsoever to do with it!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Judge:
Though it has holes, I must admit the argument presented by the defence has much promise. I believe the cross-examination should continue.
Ryunosuke:
(The link between Graydon and the victim of the omnibus case must be there somewhere. But I haven't found it yet...)
Iris:
Oh dear... It looks like you need to give your argument more strength, Runo.
Judge:
You will reiterate your testimony if you please, Mr Graydon.
Graydon:
If I must, though I maintain exactly what I did at the start of this pointless cross-examination.

As the court has heard, Morse code comprises of two tones: a short 'dot' and a long 'dash'. With a second disk in place, this music box could be used to generate Morse code and convey a message!
Leads to:
"AAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!"
Present anywhere else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Yes! This is it, then!
Judge:
......... It appears you know what's coming, Counsel. Clearly that was an answer given in desperation by one floundering to substantiate his argument!
Ryunosuke:
GAAAAAAH! (Ugh... Was it that obvious?)
Iris:
I'm sure you're on the right lines, Runo. There's something about that music box. There has to be!
Judge:
Continue with the cross-examination, Counsel.
Leads back to cross-examination
Press (after correctly presenting bottom compartment in Small Music Box)
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
However! As the defence has just demonstrated... ...the music box is able to play a second disk simultaneously.
Graydon:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Which means there's a possibility the device could in fact have been used to produce Morse code!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
My Nipponese friend forces me to repeat myself. The courtroom is no place for mere possibilities. Present the second disk of which you speak...or your argument is dead in the water.
Ryunosuke:
I, I just can't do that at this time.
Van Zieks:
And may I remind the court that as the witness has pointed out... ...he was not the one in the omnibus with McGilded two months ago, striking a deal over the disk or disks.
Judge:
Indeed. That was Mr Mason, the brickmaker.
Graydon:
Exactly! I had nothing whatsoever to do with it!
Van Zieks:
So as my learned friend appears to be persisting with this line of argument... ...I presume the defence is able to show a connection between the brickmaker and this witness?
Ryunosuke:
...! (He's got me. I have to find a decisive piece of evidence here or it's all over!)
Graydon:
It was some low-class brickmaker negotiating with McGilded anyway, was it not? I've no relation to the man!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So two months ago in that omnibus...McGilded killed the brickmaker and stole the disk...
Van Zieks:
Mr Mason was a single man with almost nothing to his name. It seems he lived in an artisan quarter some years ago, but people there remember little about him.
Ryunosuke:
That doesn't make much sense, though, does it? How would a humble brickmaker come to acquire secret government information?
Graydon:
How indeed?
Ryunosuke:
There must have been somebody else involved behind the scenes in all of this. Somebody who acquired the disk and gave it to Mr Mason... ...in order to take it to the meeting with McGilded and negotiate a deal!
Graydon:
......... Dear me. You may have it in for me, sir, but I assure you...I have far more class than that.
Ryunosuke:
(An old brickmaker from an artisan quarter and this well-to-do communications officer... If only I could find some evidence to link the two of them together...)
Graydon:
.........
Judge:
If you have nothing more to add on that note, let us return to the witness testimony.
Present McGilded Case Notes (after Ashley Graydon profile is updated in the Court Record; before correctly presenting bottom compartment in Small Music Box)
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Ashley Milverton... Tell me, why did you try to hide your former name from the court?
Graydon:
Because I haven't gone by that name for years. It means nothing to me!
Ryunosuke:
No, I don't think that's the real explanation at all. The truth is...you had a reason to hide that name!
Graydon:
.........
Judge:
Explain yourself, please, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
I have here the notes from the omnibus case, My Lord. And as we all know, the victim - the man who we now understand to have been negotiating with McGilded...
Judge:
Yes...Mr Mason, the brickmaker?
Ryunosuke:
That's right. Only 'Mason' wasn't his surname at all. It was his given name. His full name...was Mason Milverton.
Judge:
Mil... Milverton?! Do, do you mean to say...? Saints alive!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Ashley Milverton... ...is it not the case that the brickmaker, Mr Mason Milverton...was your father?
Graydon:
Ugh! I, I don't...
Van Zieks:
As I believe I mentioned earlier... ...your family history will have been thoroughly checked when you joined the civil service. And it really would take no time at all for the court to subpoena those records.
Graydon:
Grrr...
Ryunosuke:
The truth is you have been illegally acquiring highly confidential government information... ...and selling it on to McGilded in collaboration with your father!
Graydon:
Objection!
Graydon:
This is slander!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Graydon:
I carved a new life for myself as a respectable communications officer. As a gentleman! I have no idea what my father has been up to. But it has nothing to do with me!
Van Zieks:
And may I remind the court... ...that the assertion that this disk contains some sort of message in Morse code has been reliably disproven. By a professional and independent communications officer, no less.
Judge:
Hmmm... The relationship between the victim of the omnibus case and this witness is undoubtedly significant. However, the defence's argument remains somewhat incomplete, I feel.
Ryunosuke:
No!
Judge:
I believe the cross-examination should continue.
Ryunosuke:
(Alright, so Morse code uses two tones. If I could just demonstrate the possibility that this could have been used to generate two distinct tones...)
Iris:
Hm...perhaps we should have a really good look over the music box, Runo.
Judge:
You will reiterate your testimony if you please, Mr Graydon.

Van Zieks:

Ryunosuke:
Certainly, the idea of a humble brickmaker gaining access to government secrets seems far-fetched. But having learnt that his son is an elite communications officer, the idea suddenly becomes more credible.

Gor blimey, ain't that the troof! Remember 'Milverton &amp; Skulkin's Milk Run'? That woz a corker, eh?
Van Zieks:
Save it until after the trial! Your reminiscing has no place in this courtroom. And neither does your fruit.
Nash:
Oi! The geezer asked us a question, didn't 'e? An' we woz answerin'!
Ringo:
Yeah, we ain't done nuffin' wrong!
Judge:
Nevertheless, the court is not prepared to accompany you on your trip down memory lane. Counsel, can we turn our attention back to the testimony, please?
Ryunosuke:
(I don't know... Could that sentimental story be relevant somehow?)
Add it to the testimony
Ryunosuke:
My Lord!
Judge:
Yes, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
The brothers' last sentimental statement...could hold vital information relating to this case!
Judge:
Very well, Counsel. I will permit the brothers to supplement their testimony with that detail. ...Briefly, I hasten to add.
Say no more! ...A Skulkin's never skulkin'!
Adds statement: "'Milverton &amp; Skulkin's Milk Run'... Gor, them were the days!"
Let it go
Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course, My Lord. I apologise for the diversion. (Watching them munch on that fruit is making me hungry, anyway. I'd love to crunch some of that apple!)
Iris:
Oh, I prefer pears! They're so sweet!
Judge:
Very good. So, Mr and Mr Skulkin, you will reiterate the rest of your testimony for the court.
Say no more! ...A Skulkin's never skulkin'!
Leads back to cross-examination
Graydon:
Enough! Why don't you 'baddies' desist with the fiction?
Nash:
...!
Graydon:
Obviously...I don't know these men from Adam! Now, for the last time, stop trying to implicate me in your sordid thievery!
Nash:
Well that's bloomin' nice, innit? You little turncoat! Fine, if that's 'ow ya want it... Two can play at that game! We ain't never 'eard o' this geezer before, either! Don't know 'im from Adam!
Ryunosuke:
Uhh...
Nash:
Never spoken to 'im before in me life! Never even seen 'im!
Ringo:
Never, Nash! NEVER!
Judge:
Good grief! Such a blatant lie will not stand in my courtroom!
Ringo:
Well, well...all I'll say is this...
Press (after adding sixth statement)
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Like Mr Graydon told you to do, you mean?
Nash:
That's it, yeah. Who else, eh? Silly me thought 'e woz just poppin' over for a natter after all them years, but the rotter 'ad a dodgy job for us! Eh, Ash?
Graydon:
Enough! Why don't you 'baddies' desist with the fiction?
Nash:

Ringo:
If we'd known there woz dodgy gov'ment secrets involved, we wouldn't 'ave touched it!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So did you know nothing about this music box?
Ringo:
We didn't know nuffin'! We still don't know nuffin'! And we ain't plannin' on knowin' nuffin' about it, neither!
Ryunosuke:
But two nights ago, you did indeed break into Windibank's pawnbrokery, didn't you? In your original testimony... ...you said that the door of the shop was ajar, and that it was like some kind of a sign, begging you to go in. But the truth is...you were planning to break into Windibank's all along, weren't you?
Ringo:
We were, guv, we were. Yer right there.
Nash:
Cos that's wot 'e told us to do! It woz 'is plan!
Graydon:
.........
Ryunosuke:
And why was it Mr Graydon's plan to break into Windibank's that night? Did you not ask the reason?
Ringo:
Well, um...erm... ...'E said the place woz full o' stuff worth nickin'. That's wot 'e told us beforehand, anyway. Turned out it woz a load o' cobblers, didn't it? I weren't best pleased, I can tell ya!
Ryunosuke:
(In any case, if they know the real reason, it doesn't sound like they're going to give it away...)
Nash:
'Milverton &amp; Skulkin's Milk Run'... Gor, them were the days!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
I'm sure I'm going to regret asking, but...what exactly was that? Some kind of business?
Nash:
Just a little scheme we 'ad goin' back when we woz youngsters. A bit o' fun, really.
Ringo:
Deliverin' fresh milk to the locals, that's wot it woz all about!
Ryunosuke:
That sounds alarmingly legitimate. There must be a catch. (I suppose since we're here, I should ask them to elaborate. But on what?)
The business model
Ryunosuke:
So...how did your little business work exactly?
Nash:
Well, every mornin' down our way, the milkman would come wiv 'is cart to deliver milk, see. If ya stuck yer empties outside yer front door, 'e would leave ya them full again, right?
Ringo:
So...we swooped in on the action! Got people to sign up wiv us. We promised to deliver milk fer 'alf the price o' the other geezers doin' it! People couldn't wait to sign on the dotted line! We were rakin' it in, we were!
Ryunosuke:
So...did you live on a dairy farm or something?
Ringo:
Gordon Bennett! Are you off yer rocker?! We 'ad nuffin'! We were too poor to 'ave a farm!
Ryunosuke:
Right.
Nash:
Nah, wot we 'ad goin' on woz simple once you 'ad the idea. We'd just switch 'em over, see. Our customers' empties wiv the full ones from anyone who wasn't on our books. A doddle, right?
Ryunosuke:
......... I think you meant to say 'a diddle'. And that's a crime.
Nash:
It woz just an 'armless bit o' fun, that's all!
Judge:
Milking the general public in such a fashion is most certainly not ''armless', as you put it.
Ringo:
Well, it woz 'im wot came up wiv the idea. Ash is the evil genius.
Ryunosuke:
You mean, Mr Graydon?
Graydon:
.........
Ringo:
Yeah, Ash always 'ad 'is 'ead in a book when we woz growin' up. Said 'e woz gonna get 'imself an edumation an' get out o' that slum we lived in.
Nash:
Cor, we all ragged 'im about that, didn't we? Told 'im 'e woz soft in the 'ead to even think it! But look at 'im now. 'E's only gone an' become a blinkin' com...commaca...comnication officer, ain't 'e?
Judge:
A communications officer, Mr Skulkin.
Iris:
......... Hm...Sholmes &amp; Wilson's Milk Run...
Ryunosuke:
No, Iris! Don't even think about it!
Leads back to cross-examination
The business name
Ryunosuke:
So this business was just a bit of fun, you say? And it was just yourselves and Mr Graydon involved?
Nash:
Yeah, that's it.
Ryunosuke:
'Milverton &amp; Skulkin's Milk Run', was it?
Ringo:
Yeah, that's it.
Ryunosuke:
And where did the 'Milverton' part come from?
Nash:
Oh right. I thought a clever clogs like you'd 'ave worked that one out. That's 'is-
Graydon:
Hold it!
Graydon:
Enough of this! How much longer are we expected to listen to this drivel? I don't-
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Let me guess? You don't accept anything these two witnesses are saying?
Graydon:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Tell me! Why is it that it was only at the mention of the name Milverton that you decided to interject?
Graydon:
B-Because I...well...
Nash:
It weren't the 'appiest of 'omes that one came from.
Ringo:
Yeah, 'is old man woz strugglin' fer money so much, 'is wife walked out on 'im.
Nash:
She took the name Graydon then, see.
Ringo:
But Ash will always be Milverton to us!
Ryunosuke:
Milverton... So that used to be your surname, did it?
Graydon:
Of course not! This is all bunkum! I've been a Graydon since I was born! Do you really think you can rely on the testimony of these two thieves, hm?
Van Zieks:
You're a communications officer attached to the civil service. As such, your personal details will have been thoroughly checked at the time of your appointment. It would be a very simple matter indeed to subpoena those records, Mr...Graydon.
Graydon:
Agh!
Judge:
Well. It would appear that Mr and Mr Skulkin's testimony has been reliable...for once. You were born Ashley Milverton, then. Is that correct?
Graydon:
......... Very well. Yes.
Ryunosuke:
(So Ashley Graydon was once Ashley Milverton... That information could change things... And could turn out to be extremely important.)
Ashley Graydon's personal profile has been updated in the Court Record.
Graydon:
.........
Leads back to cross-examination
Leave it
Ryunosuke:
Well, nothing about that seems particularly relevant here, so...I think I've heard enough.
Nash:
Eh? Come on, guv, I woz just warmin' up there. I got plenty to tell!
Ringo:
Yeah, come on. Ya can't say you ain't gonna bite now. Yer the one who brought it up!
Ryunosuke:
(That makes me the only one not biting here, in fact.)
Judge:
Let us return to the witnesses' testimony then.

(So Ashley Graydon was once Ashley Milverton... That information could change things... And could turn out to be extremely important.)
Ryunosuke:
All of a sudden, we seem to be up to our necks in a serious matter of national security. Although all this talk about interception of secret government messages is still just conjecture at this stage.
Iris:
It would explain a number of things though, wouldn't it? The negotiation Ginny overheard on the omnibus two months ago, and the break-in at Windibank's. But the trouble is, it wasn't Mr Graydon in the omnibus with Mr McGilded...
Ryunosuke:
No, that was Mr Mason, the brickmaker who was so horribly murdered.
Iris:
Hm...if only there was some link between the two men somehow.
Ryunosuke:
I know. But Mr Graydon's testimony seems to be as watertight as ever. I wonder if the key to us making headway with the cross-examination here... (...could be those two brothers.)
Graydon:
AAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
Ryunosuke:
The new facts and evidence unveiled by the cross-examination of this witness... ...all come together to reveal the truth!
Graydon:
The, the truth, you say?
Ryunosuke:
That you collaborated with your father, Mr Mason Milverton, in illegal dealings with Magnus McGilded.
Judge:
By dint of this music box, you mean, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Stealing information being sent in secret government communications, and selling it on to McGilded... Mr Graydon concocted this elaborate scheme of using two music box disks to encode the information... ...as, presumably, a safety measure against the information falling into the wrong hands.
Judge:
And a very effective one. I shouldn't have given the scheme any credence whatsoever.
Van Zieks:
But the deal with McGilded went sour...and the brickmaker met his end.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, but before he was arrested, McGilded managed to temporarily dispose of the stolen disk at the pawnbroker. Then, having learnt of the situation, you appeared at Windibank's two days ago... ...in an attempt to recover the two articles McGilded had placed in pawn there.
Graydon:
.........
Van Zieks:
But that attempt failed.
Ryunosuke:
One of the disks was seized by the police, and the other, you never found. So that same night... ...you enlisted the help of the Skulkin brothers and broke into the pawnbrokery. This time, determined to recover the second disk!
Judge:
Are, are you suggesting that the second disk...was inside the music box?!
Nash:
Eh?
Ringo:
We, we never knew nuffin' about that!
Ryunosuke:
On the night that Mr Windibank was killed... ...the intruder to the pawnbrokery touched one item, and one item alone: the music box.
Judge:
As rather ingeniously demonstrated using the two prints from the security camera, indeed.
Ryunosuke:
So, the question that naturally begs answering is this: why was only that one article disturbed? The answer is obvious: because it contained the second disk, which the intruder was desperate to retrieve. Since, if it were to fall into the hands of the police, it would be proof...of high treason.
Graydon:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Well, Mr Graydon? Do you deny that all of this actually began on that fateful night two months ago?
Graydon:
......... I... I... I refuse to accept any of this nonsense!
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Sir... ...there appears to be blood seeping through the sleeve of your jacket.
Graydon:
What?! Ah!
Ryunosuke:
Two nights ago... ...we know that three shots were fired at the scene of the crime in Windibank's pawnbrokery. One took the life of the pawnbroker himself... One struck the pouch around Mr Sholmes's waist... And the final bullet... ...struck the calendar on the wall of the shop, having first pierced the arm of one of the intruders. Mr Graydon... ...that wound on your arm that you seem to be trying to hide... It's a bullet wound, isn't it?
Graydon:
.........
Nash:
'E's got ya now, me old china.
Ringo:
Time to call it quits an' croak, I reckon.
Graydon:
......... Tsk. 'Don't acknowledge my presence there under any circumstances whatsoever.' Those were my terms, remember? And I paid you handsomely to comply. Clearly I was a fool to think I could trust some common back slum thieves.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Graydon:
Fine. I admit it. I was there in Windibank's that night. I paid this pair ten guineas to accompany me. And as you've noticed, I sustained an injury in the course of my adventures. But that is all! I admit to nothing more! Stealing government secrets? Negotiating with Mr McGilded? As God is my witness...I'm sure I recall nothing of the sort!
Ryunosuke:
(He's not going to go down without a fight. Not until I can show hard evidence, I suppose.) Nevertheless, the defence has now established a crucial fact.
Van Zieks:
Which is...?
Ryunosuke:
Well, we know that one bullet was fired from each of the two firearms we have in evidence. The bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun hit the pouch around Mr Sholmes's waist. And the bullet from Mr Windibank's gun... ...clearly must have been the one that caught Mr Graydon on the arm.
Judge:
Indeed it must. We can rule out the possibility that the man shot himself.
Graydon:
.........
Ryunosuke:
And that leads us to only one conclusion: Mr Windibank was shot by a third gun... ...which can only have been fired by the third intruder.
Judge:
Goodness!
Van Zieks:
...!
Ryunosuke:
That's right, Mr Graydon.
Graydon:
Grrr...
Ryunosuke:
The only person who could possibly have shot Mr Windibank that night...is you!
???:
Hold it!
Graydon:
Ha ha ha ha ha... You little upstart! You made a grave mistake when you summoned me here.
Ryunosuke:
What? (What's that supposed to mean?)
Graydon:
Yes, as you rightly say, I was there at the pawnbroker's. I did my best to hide the fact, naturally. I had no intention of ruining the distinguished career I'd built for myself at the communication station. But did the thought never cross your mind? Did you never consider the possibility?
Ryunosuke:
What, what do you mean? What thought? What possibility?
Graydon:
The possibility that if I was there at the scene... I may have witnessed the crucial moment. You see... ...this makes me a key witness in this case...and I have my hands firmly around the neck of your client!
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Judge:
Are, are you suggesting...?
Graydon:
I saw it all! I saw the very moment that pickpocket girl pointed the gun at that poor, defenceless pawnbroker...and shot him!
Ryunosuke:
You... WHAAAAAAAAT?!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Well... ...it would seem we are finally entering the last act of this theatrical trial.
Van Zieks:
Mr Graydon...
Graydon:
Yes?
Van Zieks:
I trust you are fully aware of the implications here? If it is shown that your claim is false... ...you will have incriminated yourself as the killer.
Graydon:
......... Oh, I understand fully.
Judge:
Then I must ask you to give your formal testimony once more. You will explain to the court precisely what you saw at the moment the defendant allegedly shot the victim.
Graydon:
...Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
Witness Testimony
- The Moment of the Shooting -
Graydon:
While these ruffians were jostling with the broker, I was still near the entrance to the shop.
When Windibank threw Nash over the counter, I felt a sharp pain in my arm.
I pursued the man but he shut himself in the storeroom. I could see him through the peephole in the door, though.
The accused, in a black coat, shot the man in the back as he was trying to flee to safety!
I saw the blood spatter all over that wretched girl.
Then she tossed the gun out of the peephole. So I picked it up...and made my escape.
Judge:
Good gracious! This, this is quite extraordinary testimony!
Graydon:
.........
Judge:
You claim, sir - under oath - to have clearly seen the defendant pulling the trigger! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar!
Graydon:
It wasn't my intention to testify in this way. But neither is it my intention to be found guilty of a murder I didn't commit. So you see...my hand has been forced. I tell the truth now as an act of self-preservation.
Ryunosuke:
...! The truth?
Van Zieks:
Until now, the prosecution was completely unaware of these details.
Gregson:
Yes...well, um...sorry about that.
Graydon:
Having shot me in the arm, the pawnbroker was then shot in the back by the accused. And as I said...she was showered in his blood.
Van Zieks:
You say the blood splattered over the accused's coat? Are you sure on that point?
Graydon:
Oh yes. Quite sure. All over the black overcoat that pickpocket girl was wearing at the time.
Judge:
Really? If her coat could somehow be shown to harbour vestiges of blood, that would be conclusive evidence here!
Van Zieks:
...Such an investigation is entirely possible, My Lord.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Van Zieks:
Only very recently, a German scientist has developed a technique to identify human blood. So here's to true science...not some amateurish detective's dubious foray into the world of chemistry.
Iris:
There's nothing dubious about Hurley's work! His ideas are all sound!
Van Zieks:
Ideas are no use to us here. In science, as in law, theories must be proven before they stand.
Iris:
...!
Van Zieks:
In Germany, the technique has already been employed in the courtroom as the basis of evidence. Scotland Yard has a small quantity of the chemical reagent used. With Your Lordship's permission... ...we could shatter all vestiges of doubt within minutes!
Judge:
Hm...
Iris:
This doesn't look good, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
Why not?
Iris:
Well, we know, don't we? That there's blood all over the front of Ginny's coat. If they test it with their chemicals...
Ryunosuke:
Oh help! You're right! (I was forgetting what happened yesterday...)
Iris:
Don't move, Ginny! I'm going to shoot!
Ryunosuke:
(But that's not Mr Windibank's blood. That stain is from two months ago. That's Mr Mason's blood, from when he was stabbed by McGilded, who was wearing the coat at the time!) My Lord! The defence objects to the test proposed by the prosecution!
Judge:
Overruled. Lord van Zieks. Make it so at once!
Van Zieks:
...With pleasure, My Lord.
Judge:
And while we await the results, the defence may proceed with the cross-examination.
Ryunosuke:
......... (Once they find that blood on the overcoat... ...Gina will be...)
Judge:
Counsel!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!
Judge:
Your cross-examination!
Ryunosuke:
Of course, My Lord. (If this cross-examination doesn't go well... If I don't manage to uncover some decisive evidence or a really compelling clue now... ...I have a very bad feeling about the outcome of this trial.)
Cross-Examination
- The Moment of the Shooting -
Graydon:
While these ruffians were jostling with the broker, I was still near the entrance to the shop.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Windibank emerged from the storeroom, I believe?
Graydon:
Ringo and Nash were scouring the counter when he suddenly appeared and flew at them. He already had the revolver in his hand. ...Fortunately, I wasn't too close.
Nash:
I've never been so scared in all me life!
Ringo:
Yeah, we're just yer regular, mild-mannered burglars, that's all. We dun't like violence.
Ryunosuke:
...Says the pair who carry a gun. What do you mean when you say you were 'near the entrance to the shop'?
Graydon:
I was in the doorway, running my eyes over the shelves of forfeited items.
Ryunosuke:
(Looking for the music box, of course.)
Graydon:
The broker went for Nash in the first place. Then Ringo joined in, making it two against one. So I assumed they could handle the situation. But I was wrong.
Ringo:
I woz tryin' to 'elp me little bruv, but the old geezer chucked me over the bloomin' counter!
Nash:
So I pulled me gun on the old fella, an' that soon made 'im scarper.
Judge:
The pair of you setting upon the poor, defenceless pawnbroker together? Shame on you!
Sorry, guv...
Graydon:
When Windibank threw Nash over the counter, I felt a sharp pain in my arm.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You mean that's the moment you were shot?
Graydon:
Yes. Though I didn't immediately realise what had happened, of course. Things crashed to the floor from the counter as the three men were brawling. It was at exactly that moment that it happened. So I didn't hear the gunshot.
Ryunosuke:
And the bullet went on to strike the calendar in the wall behind you...
Graydon:
So it would appear. When I looked at my arm, I saw it was bleeding badly. So I wrapped my handkerchief around it. Seeing as I couldn't explain what had happened to a doctor, I had no choice but to wait for it to heal. I didn't imagine it would still be bleeding two days later.
Van Zieks:
Did Mr Windibank intend to shoot you, do you think?
Graydon:
Well now...I don't imagine he even noticed I was there, to be honest. Perhaps the gun went off accidentally. Anyway, it didn't quite strike home.
Nash:
When I pulled me gun on 'im, 'e tried to shove me out the way.
Ringo:
And then 'e scarpered fru that door out back.
Judge:
At which point, what did you do?
Graydon:
I pursued the man but he shut himself in the storeroom. I could see him through the peephole in the door, though.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You mean you chased after him?
Graydon:
I don't recall the reason why. But I ran after him to the back of the shop.
Ryunosuke:
And what about this 'peephole in the door' you mentioned?
Gregson:
Well, unsurprisingly, the storeroom door's a solid job. Made of stout wood. But there's a small openin' in it about head height that lets you see what's what in there from the outside.
Ryunosuke:
(Actually, I should know that, shouldn't I? I looked through it myself that night.)
Van Zieks:
And what about you burgling brothers? Did you see what went on through this peephole as well?
N-N-Not likely, guv!
D-Didn't see nuffin' o' the sort, guv!
Graydon:
I doubt these two buffoons were even aware of the peephole's existence.
Ryunosuke:
(So the Skulkin brothers were there, but they didn't see the killing of Mr Windibank take place.)
Judge:
Hm...
Graydon:
Inside the storeroom, I could see the broker and that young girl standing there.
Judge:
The defendant?
Graydon:
Yes. Though neither of them noticed that I was looking. The girl raised her gun and pointed it straight at the man.
Judge:
And then...? What did you see next?
Graydon:
The accused, in a black coat, shot the man in the back as he was trying to flee to safety!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, when the crime was discovered, the defendant was found with a gun in her hand. But that was Mr Windibank's gun, from which only a single bullet had been fired. And as we've clearly established, Mr Graydon, that bullet was fired at you!
Graydon:
Ah, but no... It wasn't the broker's gun that the pickpocket girl had when I saw her. Yes, the bullet from Windibank's gun grazed my arm... And yes, the Skulkins' gun grounded the detective... But this...was another gun entirely. A third gun.
Van Zieks:
The broker's gun was not the murder weapon. So clearly there had to be a third firearm involved. In other words, the accused must have had her own gun with her at the time.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But no other gun was found at the scene!
Graydon:
Ha ha ha ha ha... Calm yourself, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Graydon:
You must consider the events in order.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Graydon:
At first I saw the broker and the girl glaring at each other, but then, all of a sudden... ...the broker turned to run. And it was at that moment, that the little gutter rat shot him in the back!
Judge:
...A chilling image, I must say.
Graydon:
.........
Graydon:
I saw the blood spatter all over that wretched girl.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
All, all over her?
Graydon:
Yes, through the peephole, I saw it clearly. Of course, the stains are invisible now, what with the coat being such a dark colour. But I assure you...that garment is sullied with the victim's blood!
Ryunosuke:
(Well...it is sullied with blood, that's for sure.)
Iris:
But it's not Mr Windibank's blood, is it?
Ryunosuke:
No, that's right. It's Mr Mason Milverton's blood from when McGilded stabbed him two months ago.
Iris:
It's so annoying! If they'd only accept Hurley's chemical analysis, we could prove that.
Ryunosuke:
But they won't. So unfortunately, we can't use it as evidence to support our case.
Iris:
Bother...
Graydon:
Then she tossed the gun out of the peephole. So I picked it up...and made my escape.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Did, did I hear you correctly? She threw the gun out of the room?
Graydon:
That's right. After the broker fell to the floor, she started walking over.
Judge:
Over where exactly?
Graydon:
In the direction of the storeroom door. To where I was watching. Of course, I quickly retreated. And then... ...the girl dropped the gun through the peephole onto the floor on my side of the door.
Judge:
But why on earth would she do such a thing?
Graydon:
...I couldn't tell you. Perhaps she was hoping to distance herself from the murder weapon. Without thinking, I went and picked it up. I suppose I was worried about just leaving it there, in case any more tragedies took place.
Van Zieks:
......... So it was you, in fact, who took the third gun from the scene of the crime?
Graydon:
Yes...it was yours truly.
Judge:
Hm...
Graydon:
I left the clear-up to my lackeys and left.
Ryunosuke:
Clear-up?
Nash:
We'd made a bit of a mess around the counter, so Mr Whistle 'n' Flute 'ere told us to tidy up.
Ringo:
'E thinks 'e's our bloomin' mum sometimes!
Graydon:
Well I was paying you enough, by God!
Nash:
Ugh...
Ryunosuke:
Tell me, Mr Graydon, when you left the pawnbrokery that night... ...was it by any chance with the second disk in your jacket pocket?
Graydon:
......... You're like a bull at a gate, aren't you? But I admit to nothing of the sort. After all, you can't even show the court such a disk exists...can you?
Pursue Tobias Gregson or Nash Skulkin
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Gentlemen!
Nash:
Hahh...hahh...hah...hahh... Hahh!
Gregson:
Somethin' wrong, sunshine?
Ryunosuke:
That should be my line. You...do realise you were just violently shaking Mr Skulkin?
Nash:
Blimey, this dee's a bit of an 'ooligan, ain't 'e?
Ryunosuke:
What was going on just now?
Nash:
You saw 'im! 'E grabbed me whistle! 'Why the blazes,' 'e said, 'didn't ya mention the third gun when we got ya down the station?'
Ryunosuke:
And why didn't you?
Nash:
Cos! We didn't know nuffin' about it! Or that flamin' peephole in the door!
Gregson:
Um...sorry about that. I can be prone to losin' my rag sometimes. ...Not hurt, are you?
Nash:
Gor blimey, see the way 'e's lookin' at me? I'm tellin' ya, this dee gives me the willies!
Ryunosuke:
(That was strange... The inspector doesn't normally get quite as worked up as that. He wouldn't normally grab someone...)
Iris:
No, that wasn't like Gregsy at all. He's normally all sweetness and light, no matter what I say to him.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, well... I think you might be a special case, Iris.
Iris:
Well anyway. That was definitely out of character.
Gregson:
.........
Leads back to cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
(As expected... ...he won't admit to anything unless I can thrust the evidence in his face.)
Graydon:
Ha ha ha ha ha... It's not as easy as you thought, is it? To pin a crime on this lapel.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Graydon:
Ha ha... It won't stick. Not murder...not treason...
Ryunosuke:
(Maybe not right now, but you won't be sniggering like that forever!)
Iris:
What's your feeling, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
As much as I hate to admit it...I don't see any obvious holes in his testimony at the moment.
Iris:
But you have to find a way to break this man!
Ryunosuke:
(And quickly, too. Because once they discover the blood on the overcoat Gina was wearing...)
Iris:
It's a bit strange that he's so sure of himself about seeing the blood spatter over Ginny's coat. It doesn't strike me as the sort of thing you'd claim if you hadn't genuinely seen it happen.
Ryunosuke:
But we know that Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank. So what's going on...?
Iris:
All I know is that it's very unfair! Why should some German scientist's test be acceptable as evidence when mine and Hurley's wasn't? Detectives can use test tubes, too!
Ryunosuke:
(Never mind that. I have to find a really stark inconsistency in this testimony somewhere. And I have to find it before the prosecution discovers the bloodstain on Gina's coat!)
After pressing first, second, third, fourth, and fifth statements and pursuing Tobias Gregson or Nash Skulkin correctly:
???:
My Lord!
Bailiff:
Requesting Your Lordship's permission to interrupt the cross-examination!
Judge:
Explain yourself, Officer!
Bailiff:
I have the results of the test that was ordered earlier, My Lord!
Van Zieks:
Ah...the blood... On the accused's overcoat.
Judge:
Thank you, Officer. Very well, the cross-examination is hereby temporarily suspended. I presume you have no objection, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Um... No, My Lord.
Gregson:
......... Well, there you have it!
Van Zieks:
The report, please, Inspector.
Gregson:
Yes, sir! 'Traces of human blood were found on the overcoat of the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade. From the extent of the stains, it would appear that they were the result of spattering following a gunshot wound.' ...End of report!
Judge:
Goodness me!
Graydon:
...See? What did I tell you?
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
No! The blood on that coat is not Mr Windibank's!
Judge:
What on earth makes you say that, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
The coat originally belonged to Magnus McGilded. Just before his coat was deposited at Windibank's, McGilded had fatally stabbed Mr Mason Milverton. So the blood on that overcoat...is the blood of the brickmaker from the omnibus case!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Well...the dead cannot speak. ...Isn't that right, my Nipponese friend?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Van Zieks:
Two months ago in this very courtroom... ...did you not argue fervently for McGilded's innocence? And yet now that the man is dead...you brand him as a murderer? Your conduct shatters any shred of respect you may have earnt for yourself in this country!
Ryunosuke:
Agh! But, but that was...
Juror No. 1:
I call it a bally disgrace! Treachery, that's what it is!
Juror No. 3:
Hm, how to determine whether the blood on that coat is two months old or not...? Even a stereoscope couldn't help the answer to that problem pop out. It can't be done!
Ryunosuke:
But...but... ...we used Mr Sholmes's specially formulated chemicals-
Juror No. 4:
Mr Sholmes is a detective, not a chemist!
Juror No. 5:
Would you put such faith in a chemical formula devised by me, for example, when I'm a communications officer?
Juror No. 6:
I held out pirozhki to starving boy, and he ran away crying.
Van Zieks:
Herlock Sholmes is barely more than a figment of the public's imagination. His name carries no weight in this courtroom! ...No weight at all.
Ryunosuke:
How could you say that?!
Graydon:
...Victory is sweet indeed. This proves that my testimony is the whole truth from start to finish!
Judge:
How do you arrive at such a conclusion, sir?
Van Zieks:
As the witness said, the accused's coat was spattered with the blood of the victim. The only way Mr Graydon could possibly have known that fact, is if he saw it happen. In other words...his testimony is solid, and the conclusion is singular: It was the accused who shot the victim in this case. That...is the whole truth!
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAARGH!
???:
My Lord!
Juror No. 1:
Been a long battle, this one, but this old warhorse has something to say now, if you please.
Judge:
Mr Foreman...?
Juror No. 1:
As of this moment, sir, the squadron has reached its final decision. Ready, men? All for one now!
SIR!
Juror No. 1:
Guilty!
Juror No. 2:
Guilty!
Juror No. 3:
Guilty!
Juror No. 4:
Guilty!
Juror No. 5:
Guilty!
Juror No. 6:
Guilty!
Judge:
Well, it would appear the ladies and gentlemen of the jury have reached a unanimous verdict.
Van Zieks:
The defence has consistently failed to unpick this witness's testimony. Here's to any attempt you may make at unpicking the jurors' decisions being...equally successful.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH! (I don't believe it... After I've come so far... How is it all unravelling on me so fast...?) .........
???:
How very distressing... ...to be held in such low esteem.
Bailiff:
Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?
Judge:
Officer...? You've delivered the report now. That will be all, thank you.
Bailiff:
It occurs to me with some regularity, Mr Naruhodo... ...that scientific truths are determined not by science... ...but by none other than the human mind.
Ryunosuke:
(I, I know that voice...) Am I going mad...? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr Sholmes!
Judge:
Wha...? WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!
Van Zieks:
What business do you have here, detective? The last I heard, you were recuperating in hospital.
Sholmes:
As well I would be...had I not been set upon an errand.
Van Zieks:
What errand?
Iris:
Hurley! It's really you! You're awake at last!
Sholmes:
Yes, good day, Iris. I appear to be rather late to rise. My apologies. Now, My Lord...if you will humour me?
Judge:
In what manner, sir?
Sholmes:
I have something of great importance I wish to give to the young lawyer over there. I need no more than five minutes. Would you be so kind as to spare us the time?
Judge:
Hmmm... What say you to this, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
......... This trial has taken many hours of the court's time. Having spent so long already-
Gregson:
Exactly! Havin' spent so long already, we don't wanna go wastin' any more precious time!
Van Zieks:
As I was saying... Having spent so long already, it would seem churlish to deny the defence a mere five minutes.
Gregson:
EEEEEEEEEHHH?!
Judge:
Very well then. Counsel, you have five minutes.
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, I apologise for my tardy arrival.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes! Are you alright now?
Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Alright? I'm all wrong!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
I've only just managed to summon the strength to stand, man! I asked the judge for five minutes... ...but I fear even that may prove too much for me. Pray forgive me should I pass out.
Ryunosuke:
Um...let's make this discussion as short as possible.
Iris:
Hurley, this place is full of idiots! None of them can see how wonderful your chemical blood analysis is!
Sholmes:
Ah well...that concoction of mine was really just a bit of sport to assist me in my investigations. I never took the trouble to refine it for appraisal by the scientific community. ...An oversight on my part.
Ryunosuke:
Right... (Modesty? Surely not...)
Sholmes:
But enough of that. I'm here to give you this, my dear fellow.
Ryunosuke:
What's that? (A lavender furoshiki wrapping...?)
Sholmes:
A leaving present. From Miss Susato.
Ryunosuke:
From Miss Susato?
Sholmes:
If possible, matters were to be settled without me giving you this. Those were her instructions when she asked me to do her this favour.
Ryunosuke:
I...I don't understand.
Sholmes:
Miss Susato foresaw today's events, I believe. She knew that the culprit would attempt to escape justice by means both devious and underhand. And that you, Mr Naruhodo, fighting fairly as you are wont to do, would find yourself in considerable peril. At that very moment of crisis, you were to be given this small parcel. Those were the dear lady's instructions.
Ryunosuke:
(A leaving present from Susato-san... Whatever could it be?) What is this?
Iris:
Oh! It's...it's the machine I made!
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Wagahai:
Miaow.
Iris:
Look! I used this! It's my latest invention! 
Ryunosuke:
What...what is that?
Iris:
I call it...the Cat-Flapomat! It can make a cat flap for a little furry friend like Waggy in seconds!
Iris:
What's Susie up to?
Sholmes:
Miss Susato muttered the following words before she left: 'I'm a failure. I don't deserve to be a judicial assistant.'
Ryunosuke:
What? (Didn't she say something like that...?)
Ryunosuke:
You really are the best judicial assistant in the world.
Susato:
Well...that's extremely flattering. But I'm sorry to say... ...that I've been a complete failure.
Ryunosuke:
Whatever did she mean by that, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
......... That night, when you left Windibank's in pursuit of the thieves... ...Miss Susato made use of this contraption for...a certain purpose. That is your answer, dear fellow.
Ryunosuke:
(Not, not at all cryptic then... Susato-san used this Cat-Flapomat that night? But why?)
The Cat-Flapomat has been entered into the Court Record.
Van Zieks:
...Your five minutes...is over.
Examine evidence
Cat-Flapomat
Grip or trigger
Ryunosuke:
Whew! Those vicious teeth look like they could rip through almost anything!
Iris:
They're good, aren't they? They're made of a special alloy I developed just for this job. The cutter rotates ten times per second so it can get through any kind of door in no time at all!
Ryunosuke:
And...what are the two parts at the top there?
Iris:
Ah, those are for attaching hinges to the section of door that gets cut out.
Ryunosuke:
Right. Of course.
Iris:
Nothing can match this machine for power! It can make mincemeat of even the toughest of doors!
Ryunosuke:
......... It sounds so charming and friendly when you say what it's for, but... ...it feels like the reality of the Cat-Flapomat is that it's a grim weapon of door destruction.
Iris:
Wagahai's so adorable, there's nothing I wouldn't do for him! Even developing deadly weapons!
Ryunosuke:
...! (We're out of time already?)
Sholmes:
I'm grateful to you for affording us that brief recess, Mr Reaper.
Van Zieks:
I need no thanks, detective. After all... ...the die is cast.
Sholmes:
...Is it really?
Van Zieks:
The jurors are unanimous in their leanings. No doubt my learned friend will consider a summation examination... ...but any attempt to alter the verdict now would be utterly futile.
Sholmes:
......... I wonder... Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Yes?
Sholmes:
The rest is down to you, dear fellow. What is your plan?
Ryunosuke:
(The rest is down to me...? I need to be careful here. If I make a wrong move, the trial will end...badly.) My Lord! The defence requests...
A summation examination
Ryunosuke:
(Now it's come to this, my only chance is to appeal to the jurors and try to change their minds.)
Sholmes:
What do you think you're doing, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
What of Miss Susato's gracious gesture? Would you let this final piece of evidence she left you go to waste?
Ryunosuke:
Final piece of...?
Sholmes:
This is not a time for inaction. This is a time to hear from a witness!
Ryunosuke:
But, but it's not possible for me to bring a new witness to the stand at this point!
Iris:
I don't think that's what Hurley means, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Iris:
Have you forgotten where we are in the trial?
Ryunosuke:
......... (Ah-ha!)
Judge:
If the defence has nothing more to add, I think we should proceed to the adjudication.
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Wait, My Lord! The defence requests...
Leads to:
"...further cross-examination."
Further cross-examination
Leads to:
"...further cross-examination."
Time to think
Ryunosuke:
(It's no good... I need time to think...)
Sholmes:
What do you think you're doing, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
What of Miss Susato's gracious gesture? Would you let this final piece of evidence she left you go to waste?
Ryunosuke:
Final piece of...?
Sholmes:

Judge:

Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Wait, My Lord! The defence requests...
Leads to:
"...further cross-examination."
Ryunosuke:
...further cross-examination.
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
The jurors have spoken! Protocol dictates that you may not cross-examine a new witness now.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
The defence is not asking for the cross-examination of a new witness. Rather to continue with one of an existing witness.
Van Zieks:
What?
Sholmes:
It would appear that a rather important detail has escaped your attention, Mr Reaper.
???:
My Lord!
Bailiff:
Requesting Your Lordship's permission to interrupt the cross-examination!
Judge:
Thank you, Officer. Very well, the cross-examination is hereby temporarily suspended. I presume you have no objection, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Um... No, My Lord.
Iris:
So nobody can say anything then! If Runo asks to resume his cross-examination of Mr Graydon...
Sholmes:
...The court is obliged to allow it!
Van Zieks:
This...is absurd!
Judge:
......... I would remind those present that this is my courtroom. I concur that the defence is entirely within its rights to request the continuation of the cross-examination. However, I will not permit an unremitting protraction of these proceedings. Therefore... ...I have decided to afford the defence one final opportunity in concluding the cross-examination.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Judge:
Counsel, you must choose but one statement from the witness's testimony... ...and but one piece of evidence to present in support of your argument against it.
Ryunosuke:
(A single chance to present evidence...?)
Judge:
If, following that, the situation remains unchanged, I shall move to adjudication. Is that clear, Counsels? You will not press the witness any further!
Van Zieks:
My Lord.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!
Sholmes:
Hm... A single statement and a single piece of evidence. ...Most generous. Well then, Mr Naruhodo. It's high time I...fell in a dead faint. I leave this...in your capable hands...
*Thud!*
Ryunosuke:
Mis...
MR SHOOOOOOOOOLMES!
Judge:
To stand so insouciantly before the court in a state of such high fever... Either the man has extraordinary strength of mind, or an extraordinary lack of feeling.
Van Zieks:
I imagine he's feeling very little now. The detective is sleeping soundly in one of the antechambers.
Ryunosuke:
(Strike a man when he's down, why don't you?)
Judge:
Well then, Counsel...are you fully prepared?
Ryunosuke:
...Yes. (One statement... One piece of evidence... I won't let Mr Sholmes down. Or Iris. And I won't waste this final chance that Susato-san has given me. This is going to decide the entire outcome of the trial!)
Judge:
Very well, then. Under the terms I have outlined...you may resume the cross-examination!

Present Cat-Flapomat
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Leads to:
"What on earth is that eccentric contraption, Counsel?"
Ryunosuke:
(His Lordship is only going to allow me to present one piece of evidence here... But it's clear what that piece of evidence should be!)
Iris:
How in the world...did Susie manage to sneak off with this without me noticing? And she used it in the pawnbrokery?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. At least, that's what Mr Sholmes said. (I was only gone from the place for about five minutes when I went after the Skulkin brothers. What possible reason could Susato-san have had to use Iris's contraption in that time...?) Could it be that what she did with the Cat-Flapomat... ...completely changes one of the key premises this testimony is based on?
Judge:
What on earth is that eccentric contraption, Counsel?
Iris:
Ooh, it's my Cat-Flapomat, My Lord! It makes a way for cats to get in and out of a room. It can cut through any door you can think of and make a new little door in the middle of it!
Ryunosuke:
That's right, My Lord. It's a device for creating so-called 'cat flaps': Small doors for cats to come and go as they please without their owners having to open the main door-
Graydon:
I'm sure we can all work that out for ourselves!
Iris:
Agh!
Graydon:
But that cat-lover's contrivance has no possible relevance to this case!
Ryunosuke:
Oh really?
Graydon:
Of course it doesn't! To start with, there was no cat flap in the pawnbroker's door.
Judge:
Hm... ...not being a keeper of cats myself, I'm afraid I fail to see what this has to do with the matter at hand.
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps it would help if I described its function another way, then. This contraption... ...is able to create a peephole in any door you can imagine in practically no time at all.
Judge:
I, I beg your pardon? A peephole, you say?
Ryunosuke:
Two nights ago... ...we arrived at the scene only minutes after the murder of Mr Windibank had taken place.
Gregson:
That's right. According to the paperwork at the Yard, it was you, your Japanese assistant and Sholmes.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the three of us were together. And it's recently come to my attention... ...that my assistant made use of this device at the time.
Judge:
Your assistant did what?!
Ryunosuke:
There was a peephole in the storeroom door. I can attest to that. Because I looked through the peephole myself, in order to see inside the locked storeroom.
Graydon:
This is ludicrous! What are you trying to say? Of course there was a peephole in the door. I said as much in my testimony! How else could I have witnessed the crime, for pity's sake?
Ryunosuke:
......... Yes...how could you?
Graydon:
What?!
Judge:
Counsel, kindly say what you mean.
Ryunosuke:
(Alright, it's time... Time to strike the final blow...) What I mean is this, My Lord! My assistant made the peephole in the storeroom door. And until such time as she did... ...the door had no hole in it to look through!
Graydon:
Wha...? NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
This is a farce! Are you really suggesting that the peephole in the door was...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it was created only after the incident had taken place. By my judicial assistant, using this device.
Judge:
Your assistant tampered with the crime scene, whilst being fully aware of the gravity of her actions? That is a most serious act of vandalism!
Ryunosuke:
For which I humbly apologise, My Lord! It was in the few minutes that I left the scene in order to pursue the Skulkin brothers and alert the police. Nevertheless! In the light of this new information... ...it becomes apparent that Mr Graydon's testimony... ...is riddled with holes!
Graydon:
...!
Judge:
Riddled with...? Explain yourself, Counsel!
Ryunosuke:
The majority of Mr Graydon's testimony that appears to incriminate the defendant... ...is based upon what he witnessed through the peephole in the storeroom door.
Graydon:
Yes... That filthy girl shooting the man in the back!
Ryunosuke:
However...if at the time of the incident... ...that peephole did not yet exist in the door... ...there's no possible way that you could have seen what you claim to have seen!
Graydon:
Grrr...
Ryunosuke:
In short... ...your entire testimony...is a pack of lies!
Graydon:
Ugh!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Is, is there any credence in this revelation?
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
None whatsoever! ...As my learned friend must surely realise.
Graydon:
Ex-Exactly! This is just some cheap trick designed to discredit me!
Ryunosuke:
I'm afraid not, sir.
Graydon:
Of course it is! Do you seriously expect people to believe that plaything can cut through a solid wooden door?
Iris:
Oh yes! I designed it to be very powerful. It can cut through even the toughest of doors!
Graydon:
That's absurd! I don't believe it for a second!
Iris:
Haha, I had a feeling you'd say that.
Graydon:
What?
Iris:
Waggy! Cooey! Time for dinner!
Miaow...
Iris:
Well?
Graydon:
Ah!
Judge:
Young lady! This is the Old Bailey! One does not make cat flaps in the oak panelling at the Old Bailey!
Graydon:
I'm...I'm not done yet, don't worry! This doesn't mean that the peephole in the storeroom door at Windibank's was made by your machine. And there's no way you can prove that it was!
Iris:
No? But it's easy.
Graydon:
What?!
Iris:
The cat flaps my Cat-Flapomat creates are all of a fixed size. And the dimensions of the peephole at Windibank's are an exact match.
Graydon:
Ugh! .........
Iris:
Hee hee! Old Silky's lost for words!
Ryunosuke:
Excellent work, Iris. Thank you!
Van Zieks:
And now it's my learned student friend's turn to be lost for words, I feel.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
I believe your judicial assistant has already left the country for your Eastern island home.
Ryunosuke:
Well...yes, that's true.
Van Zieks:
Then you may have some difficulty in establishing all of the facts. For the sake of argument, let us assume the peephole has dimensions that are a perfect fit for this contraption. In that case, when was the peephole cut? ...The prosecution demands proof of your answer.
Ryunosuke:
Agh!
Judge:
What is the purpose of your line of enquiry, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
It's very simple, My Lord. The defence argues that the peephole was created after the incident using this device. But now that the perpetrator has returned to her native land, she cannot testify to the fact. There is no proof.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Van Zieks:
And for as long as the defence remains unable to prove when the peephole was made... ...my learned friend's claim amounts to nothing more...than a baseless accusation!
Ryunosuke:
WHAAAAAAAAT?!
Judge:
Indeed that is so, Lord van Zieks. ...Well, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
I, um...
Iris:
Don't give up now, Runo! This is the time to create your own opening and force your way through!
Ryunosuke:
(I don't know if I can do this. But I do know one thing... Susato-san is the greatest judicial assistant in the world!)
Judge:
Very well. The counsel for the defence will present evidence to support the claim made. Proof that the peephole in the door of Windibank's storeroom was created after the event and not before!
Present Photograph of Gina
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"What are you...?"
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The defence believes this is all the proof the court should need!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Then the defence is extremely hopeful. ...That proves nothing.
Ryunosuke:
Gyagh! (They want me to show that the peephole was created after Mr Windibank was killed, but... ...I have no idea how to do that.)
Iris:
Don't be disheartened, Runo. You can rely on Susie!
Ryunosuke:
Rely on Miss Susato...? What do you mean?
Iris:
Well she wouldn't have left you in the lurch, would she? You can be sure she thought of a way to prove what you're being asked to prove now. So there must be some evidence in the Court Record somewhere that will do the trick.
Ryunosuke:
...! (Alright then... If the point is to prove that the peephole was made after the incident... ...then it would suffice to show... ...that the peephole wasn't there before the incident took place.) With Your Lordship's permission...I'd like to present a different piece of evidence instead!
Leads back to:
"Very well. The counsel for the defence will present evidence to support the claim made."
Van Zieks:
What are you...? A print from that detective's infernal cameras, again?
Ryunosuke:
My judicial assistant - Miss Susato Mikotoba - is an extremely intelligent and capable woman. Which is why I never had any cause to doubt... ...that she would have considered this scenario, and made sure I had the necessary proof!
Judge:
And the necessary proof is this photographic print, Counsel?
Graydon:
...!
Ryunosuke:
This print shows a scene in the shop moments after the defendant entered the premises.
Van Zieks:
Agreed. And it also shows the accused mercilessly wielded a gun in the direction of the defenceless broker.
Ryunosuke:
But, but more to the point... ...it pictures the storeroom door in the background!
Judge:
Let me see that print again!
......... I, I don't believe it!
Judge:
This really is quite remarkable! The door to the storeroom... ...is completely devoid of a peephole of any description!
Graydon:
Agh!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Graydon!
Graydon:
...!
Ryunosuke:
You couldn't possibly have witnessed the crime as you claim to have done. Because at the time it happened...there was no peephole in the door.
Graydon:
Ugh...
Ryunosuke:
In other words, your testimony... ...is a catalogue of lies!
Graydon:
Nrgh...urgn...grr... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! I am satisfied that the defence has substantiated its claim beyond all reasonable doubt. This witness's testimony was entirely fallacious!
Graydon:
.........
Van Zieks:
That's not the only thing we now know beyond all reasonable doubt. My learned friend's assistant's guilt can no longer be denied. The woman tampered with a crime scene!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
But more importantly...
Judge:
Good Lord! There's more, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
The defence may have established a reprehensible instance of perjury... ...but that is no proof that this man is the victim's killer.
Graydon:
Yes... That's right...
Ryunosuke:
What?
Graydon:
I was there at the scene, it's true. And I was shot in the arm, it's true. ...But that's all. Yes, in fact, if you look at the circumstances... I am the victim here!
Ryunosuke:
Oh please... NOOOOOOOOO! (I don't believe this. But they're right. As it stands now... ...I don't have any definitive proof that he is the culprit.)
Iris:
Still...he can't worm his way out of it now.
Ryunosuke:
Iris?
Iris:
You know what they say: There's no point locking the cat's door...after the cat has bolted. Isn't that right, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Iris:
As Hurley always says: 'One lie begets another.' No, wait... That might have been a line I wrote for him in one of my stories.
Ryunosuke:
......... Well, no matter who said it first, you're right. Mr Graydon... Not only did you give false testimony to the court... ...but the lies you told make no sense.
Graydon:
'Make no sense'? What do you mean by such a remark?
Ryunosuke:
What you said in your testimony... ...reveals that you know something you shouldn't have known. In other words...there is a fundamental inconsistency in your statements!
Graydon:
What?
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
This is provocative talk, Counsel. Won't you enlighten the court? Explain this alleged inconsistency!
Ryunosuke:
(Iris was right. One lie begets another.) The inconsistency is revealed by the lies in the witness's statements. They show that Mr Graydon had knowledge of something he shouldn't have known anything about. Namely...
The third gun
Ryunosuke:
...the third gun!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Do you have any idea what you're saying, my Nipponese friend?
Ryunosuke:
Absolutely! I've been studying English hard since I was a child!
Van Zieks:
...You fail to catch my meaning. The witness has admitted to removing the gun in question from the scene himself.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Van Zieks:
Precisely who else BUT this man could have known of a third gun's existence?!
Ryunosuke:
GYAAAAAAH!
Iris:
Keep at it, Runo! Chin up!
Ryunosuke:
(After the lengths Susato-san went to in order to leave that last piece of evidence with me... In fact, perhaps I need to pursue the implications of that further... Then it might all become clear!)
Van Zieks:
There's still light in those dark eyes, I see... Will it do you any good, I wonder...
Leads back to:
"This is provocative talk, Counsel."
The peephole
Leads to:
"The point is not that you lied in your testimony, Mr Graydon..."
The bloodstains on the coat
Ryunosuke:
...the bloodstains that were present on Miss Lestrade's coat!
Graydon:
That's right. The victim's blood spattered all over her when she shot him!
Ryunosuke:
But how could you possibly have known that?
Graydon:
Obviously because I saw her do it through the peephole in...the... .........
Leads to:
"The point is not that you lied in your testimony, Mr Graydon..."
Ryunosuke:
The point is not that you lied in your testimony, Mr Graydon... It's the nature of the lie you concocted that is so revealing.
Graydon:
You're not making any sense.
Ryunosuke:
Then let me ask you a simple question: How is it, Mr Graydon... ...that you knew of the existence of the peephole in the storeroom door?
Graydon:
What? Well, obviously, I... ......... Ah! ...Argh...
Judge:
Has the cat got your tongue, witness?
Ryunosuke:
The peephole in the door was made after the incident occurred. And once I returned to the shop having failed to catch the two burglars... ...Scotland Yard's investigators arrived immediately. Since that time, the police have been at Windibank's constantly, carrying out their investigation. ...Isn't that right, Inspector Gregson?
Gregson:
Um, well... Yes, of course, erm... ...the place is chock-full of pawned articles and my lads have to thoroughly examine them all. So I gave the order to have officers workin' around the clock in shifts so we get through it all.
Ryunosuke:
And consequently there's no way that you, Mr Graydon, could have gained access to the shop.
Graydon:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Therefore! You should have known nothing about the peephole in the storeroom door. So the fact that its existence forms the basis of your testimony...is completely inexplicable!
Graydon:
Agh!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
And yet...the fact remains that Mr Graydon did maintain... ...that he witnessed the crime take place through the peephole in the door.
Judge:
How on earth is that possible?
???:
Um...
Gregson:
...Could I have a word, please, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
Speak, Inspector.
Gregson:
It's just that I really ought to be gettin' back to the station now to put in my report. There's really nothin' more I can add to this testimony, so if it's all the same to you...
Van Zieks:
Permission denied.
Gregson:
Oh...
Van Zieks:
It's not all the same to me, Inspector. Not at all. You will remain exactly where you are until this trial concludes.
Gregson:
......... Of, of course, sir.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Graydon...
Graydon:
.........
Ryunosuke:
You shouldn't have known about the existence of that peephole. Which can only mean... ...that you must have been informed about it by somebody else.
Graydon:
Ugh...
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Stop there, my learned friend. You realise, I trust, that the words you just uttered have extremely serious implications.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes. But the defence believes that the details about the case that Mr Graydon claims to have seen... ...must have been revealed to him by a certain person before his testimony. (And, in fact... ...considering a particular clue we have, there's really only one person that could be!)
Judge:
Who is the person in question, Counsel? Who gave this witness details of the crime scene to facilitate his false testimony?
Present Tobias Gregson profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The truth is...it can only have been you, Inspector Gregson!"
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
This is the person in question, My Lord!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Whatever sins others may conceal... ...it's very clear who had the means to reveal information about the crime scene to the witness.
Ryunosuke:
(Oh, drat...)
Van Zieks:
Wipe that dratted expression off your face and accept the penalty you deserve!
Ryunosuke:
Agh!
Iris:
Who knew about the peephole and the bloodstains on Ginny's coat? And who had the opportunity to pass that information on to old Silky? I can only think of one person, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...sadly, so can I...
Judge:
Perhaps you'd like to trying [sic] answering the question again, Counsel?
Leads back to:
"Who gave this witness details of the crime scene to facilitate his false testimony?"
Ryunosuke:
The truth is...it can only have been you, Inspector Gregson!
Gregson:
Eh?! Me?
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
You had better have some proof to substantiate such a rash claim, my learned friend.
Ryunosuke:
Consider the fact... ...that we have only been aware of Mr Ashley Graydon's identity for the last few hours. We learnt of it only during the course of the trial today.
Judge:
Indeed. Preparations for his testimony were made with great urgency during our hour-long recess. While the police executed the subpoena and brought the man here from the communications station.
Ryunosuke:
And until that time, Mr Graydon would have had no idea. No inkling that he would suddenly be required to appear in court.
Graydon:
.........
Judge:
Are you suggesting that until such time as he was summoned...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. Until then, it's reasonable to assume he knew nothing of the peephole. It was only once Mr Graydon was in the stand that he realised his position. That he would have to defend himself against the accusation that he was the third intruder.
Van Zieks:
You're suggesting to the court that it was while this trial was in progress that he received the information?! So that he could commit perjury in order to save his skin!
Ryunosuke:
Exactly. And the only person with knowledge of the investigation that he had any contact with... ...is you, Inspector Gregson!
Gregson:
This, this is a bloomin' outrage! Why would I be givin' away details of our investigations to this fella, eh?
Judge:
Hmmm...
Gregson:
I was summoned to His Lordship's chambers durin' the recess in any case! Had you forgotten that?
Judge:
Quite true. I had a number of questions regarding the events that transpired at the pawnbrokery.
Van Zieks:
Which means... ...the first time these two laid eyes on one another was after proceedings resumed following the recess. Since then, they've been in full view in the stand, where such illicit discussions couldn't possibly have occurred!
Ryunosuke:
Agh!
Iris:
Ooh...I've just remembered something, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
What is it, Iris?
Iris:
There was one time before, wasn't there? I think it was when Ginny was testifying.
Ryunosuke:
...Oh yes, now you mention it... ...when the bailiff was dispatched to retrieve McGilded's music box from the scene of the crime... That's it! (It was during that testimony! I remember finding it strange at the time. Mr Graydon and the inspector seemed to be having some kind of secret discussion.) It would have been possible for you to give Mr Graydon the information he needed then.
Gregson:
You little toerag! You're makin' all this up! I'm, I'm a respectable Scotland Yard inspector for cryin' out loud! Why would I do somethin' like that? Why would I be givin' away confidential details to the likes of this bloke?
Ryunosuke:
Admittedly, you wouldn't have had any reason to do something like that for no gain. But perhaps... ...it was part of a deal of some kind. Then it starts to make more sense.
Van Zieks:
...! What deal, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
I wonder if perhaps, in exchange for details about the peephole at the crime scene... ...Mr Graydon agreed to give a certain something to the inspector.
Gregson:
...!
Graydon:
.........
Judge:
I'm sure I need not remind the inspector that, if found to be true, striking a deal of any kind with a witness... ...would be considered a gross case of malfeasance!
Gregson:
Well, well I...
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
It's becoming clear... ...that jumping in with accusations is this Nipponese student's speciality.
Ryunosuke:
I, I don't do that!
Van Zieks:
But with the stakes so high, the prosecution is not prepared to listen to baseless charges. It is incumbent on the defence now to present evidence in support of this diabolical claim.
Ryunosuke:
E-Evidence...?
Van Zieks:
Just what are you proposing that the inspector demanded of the witness in return? The court must see proof of this alleged deal!
Ryunosuke:
(If Inspector Gregson really did strike a deal with Mr Graydon... ...then logically, there's only one thing he could have asked for... That MUST be it!)
Iris:
Runo...do you think it could be...?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It's the missing link that would join all the dots together in this puzzle.
Judge:
I must press you for an answer now, Counsel. What evidence explains the nature of the alleged deal that Inspector Gregson made with the witness?
Present Music Box Disk or Small Music Box
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Inspector Gregson!"
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
This, My Lord! This shows exactly what the deal between these two men was all about!
Judge:
Hmph. Well, Inspector? What do you have to say for yourself?
Gregson:
.........
Judge:
Dear me, it would appear this answer has in no way satiated your appetite.
Van Zieks:
Some of that 'bite' should be directed at my learned friend, I feel.
Ryunosuke:
GYAAAAAAH!
Iris:
I'm very surprised at Gregsy. There must have been a compelling reason for him to give away case secrets like that.
Ryunosuke:
Well...what's the most important thing to the inspector? What could have motivated him to do it?
Iris:
Hm...well most Scotland Yard inspectors that I know... ...would put nothing above their duty to policing.
Ryunosuke:
(So do we have some evidence that's related to the inspector and his duties, I wonder...?)
Leads back to:
"I must press you for an answer now, Counsel."
Ryunosuke:
Inspector Gregson! Besides this murder, is it not true that you've been working on another, very important case?
Gregson:
What...are you gettin' at now, sunshine?
Ryunosuke:
Is it possible that this other, top-secret case... ...is what's alluded to in this newspaper article here? The classified secrets being leaked overseas from the Ministry of Justice...
Gregson:
How, how the bleedin' Nora could you...?
Ryunosuke:
We discovered, during the course of this trial, the music box deposited at Windibank's by Magnus McGilded. A special music box, designed to play two disks at once. It would seem very likely now, that encoded on the pair of disks that were in McGilded's possession... ...are the leaked classified secrets.
Gregson:
.........
Ryunosuke:
So I put it to you, Inspector...that in order to recover the second of the disks containing those secrets... ...you covertly made a deal with Mr Graydon in which you exchanged the disk for details of the case!
Gregson:
You... You little... AAAAAAAAARGH!!!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!
Ryunosuke:
On the day of the incident... ...when we met you at Windibank's, you said this:
Gregson:
I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over!
Gina:
No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!
Gregson:
I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.
Ryunosuke:
Scotland Yard already knew at that time, isn't that right? That Magnus McGilded was involved in the stealing of government secrets!
Gregson:
......... My orders were: Recover the medium used to convey the secrets leaked from the ministry... ...and do it on the q.t. Strictly hush-hush.
Van Zieks:
And that explains why, when I presented this disk as evidence to the court... ...you objected so heavily, I presume? Because you knew that it contained highly confidential information.
Gregson:
Blimey, not likely! I mean, I wasn't that sure of it myself. I realised there was a possibility, that's all.
Judge:
Inspector, surely... Surely you're not saying that in order to acquire the second of these music box disks... ...you did indeed reveal confidential details of the crime scene to the witness? To aid and abet this man in giving false testimony?!
Ryunosuke:
There's no other way that Mr Graydon could have known of the existence of the peephole. It's the only explanation. A deal was struck between these two men!
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
If - and I stress 'if' - this sobering assertion turns out to be founded in truth... ...it would mean that the second disk is, as we speak, here in this very courtroom.
Ryunosuke:
Wait, what? In, in this room? How could you possibly make a claim like that?
Van Zieks:
Because Inspector Gregson is a Scotland Yard detective.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Gregson:
What's that supposed to mean, eh?
Van Zieks:
As a seasoned policeman, the inspector will have approached this alleged deal with caution. Certainly, he would not have accepted a gentleman's agreement in this matter. No...he would have insisted on having the article agreed upon in the palm of his hand.
Judge:
Good gracious! Then...you mean to say... ...Inspector Gregson already has the item in question in his possession? He has the second disk actually on his person?!
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The defence demands that the inspector is searched at once!
Iris:
Definitely! They could only have struck a deal with each other when Ginny was testifying before. And Gregsy hasn't moved from the witness stand since!
Ryunosuke:
My Lord, please! Order an examination of his personal effects immediately!
Judge:
Hmmm... Well, Inspector?
Gregson:
......... This young lad wants to tone down his imagination. He's insulted me and my profession quite enough.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Gregson:
However... ...if it'll put this matter to bed and dispel any doubts about my involvement... ...then I'll happily submit to a body search!
Ryunosuke:
What...? (He's going to agree to it?)
Van Zieks:
...I presume you're aware of the precipice on which you now teeter, my learned student friend? You've made a most serious allegation against Scotland Yard here. If, following the search of the inspector's personal effects, no disk is found... ...you will be deemed unfit for court service, this trial will end... ...and my country's government will formally demand of yours that you are severely reprimanded.
Ryunosuke:
That sounds serious...
Judge:
Indeed. To have a visiting student make such defamatory remarks about our country's most senior police force... ...is not something Her Majesty's government will be able to overlook.
Iris:
You're just threatening Runo because you're scared!
Van Zieks:
The accusation is beyond serious. You must be prepared for grave consequences.
Ryunosuke:
......... (It's true... I can't imagine Gregson would have accepted a gentleman's agreement for something so critical. The disk must have physically changed hands. Which means the inspector should have it. But somehow...something doesn't feel quite right here...)
Judge:
Very well, Counsel. You know the implications. So let me ask you one final time...
Ryunosuke:
Y-Yes, My Lord!
Judge:
Do you still persist in formally requesting a search of the inspector's personal effects?
Yes, search him!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the defence demands that Inspector Gregson is searched at once!
Judge:
Very well. Are you ready to proceed, Inspector?
Gregson:
Be my guest, sir.
And so a brief body search was carried out by the court bailiff. A few short minutes later... ...it was revealed that the inspector had nothing unusual on his person at all.
Ryunosuke:
......... GYAAAAAAAAAH!
Iris:
Just as I thought.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Iris:
Well you heard Gregsy before. He almost invited the search. It was obvious that we wouldn't find anything!
Ryunosuke:
......... Maybe consider mentioning things like that before I monumentally put my foot in it next time.
Judge:
Well, Counsel? What do you have to say for yourself now?
Van Zieks:
Have you learnt your lesson? Or do you intend to embarrass more people in this courtroom?
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (This is bad...)
Leads back to:
"Do you still persist in formally requesting a search of the inspector's personal effects?"
Search someone else!
Leads to:
"Yes, the defence formally demands the search be conducted!"
Withdraw the request
Ryunosuke:
(If they don't find anything, I'll be in serious trouble here.) No, My Lord. The defence withdraws the request.
Gregson:
Tsk. Pathetic.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gregson:
One little threat, and you abandon your beliefs, do you? I always had a suspicion your samurai spirit would be no match for the chivalry of the Brits.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
In that case, I've changed my mind! The defence does demand the search, My Lord!
Judge:
And in that case, Counsel, I have no choice but to penalise your fickle mind.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (That went well...)
Iris:
I have to agree with Gregsy. You can't turn your back on what you believe.
Ryunosuke:
No...I suppose not.
Judge:
Let me clarify your position once and for all, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
Y-Yes, My Lord!
Leads back to:
"Do you still persist in formally requesting a search of the inspector's personal effects?"
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the defence formally demands the search be conducted!
Judge:
Well!
Van Zieks:
Don't say you weren't warned. But your typical Nipponese stubbornness may well land you in hot water this time. Perhaps the lesson will do you some good.
Gregson:
Fair enough. I've got nothin' to hide.
Judge:
Very well, then. Bailiff! Conduct a search of the inspector's personal effects, please.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
The defence demands a search...but not of Inspector Gregson.
Van Zieks:
What?
Gregson:
Now what's all this? I'm the one you're accusin', aren't I? I thought you wanted to search me.
Ryunosuke:
No no, Inspector. Not you. Somebody else.
Gregson:
What's the meanin' of all this, eh? Lost it at last, have you, sunshine? The court shouldn't have to put up with this nonsense! You're bein' completely irrational!
???:
Be quiet! All of you!
Iris:
Runo's doing what you all told him to do, and having the courage of his convictions. So you should respect that and listen to what he has to say in good faith! Because that's the British way!
Judge:
...!
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
Well said, young lady. Indeed, this court is in awe of the defence counsel's conviction...and eagerly awaits his next words.
Gregson:
You what? Now don't be hasty, My Lord!
Ryunosuke:
(If I'm not mistaken about the things I've seen in court today... ...I'm fairly sure that I know who has that disk at the moment. There's only one person it can be.)
Judge:
Counsel, of whom do you request this search now?
Present Nash Skulkin profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Of, My Lord...Mr Nash Skulkin!"
Present Ashley Graydon profile
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Mr Ashley Graydon, My Lord. The defence demands that he be searched at once!
Judge:
Very well. I presume you will not protest, Mr Graydon?
Graydon:
...Au contraire.
And so a brief body search was carried out by the court bailiff. A few short minutes later... ...it was revealed that Mr Graydon had nothing unusual on his person at all.
Ryunosuke:
......... GYAAAAAAAAAH!
Judge:
Well, Counsel?
Leads back to:
"If I'm not mistaken about the things I've seen in court today..."
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
My Lord! The defence demands this person be searched at once!
Judge:
Good grief! What possible relation could exist between that person and the case, Counsel?
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
It would seem my Nipponese friend does not understand the gravity of requesting such a search. If the defence counsel's aim is humiliation... ...perhaps this will give him a taste of his own medicine!
Ryunosuke:
GYAAAAAAAAAH!
Iris:
If Gregsy doesn't have the disk at the moment... ...the question is, where could he have hidden it?
Ryunosuke:
The trouble is, he's been in the witness stand the entire time, in full view of everyone in the courtroom. Not an easy situation in which to go about hiding anything, really. (So there's honestly only one place heh could possibly have hidden it, then.)
Iris:
Perhaps in another person's pocket? Someone with him on the stand?
Judge:
Well, Counsel?
Leads back to:
"If I'm not mistaken about the things I've seen in court today..."
Ryunosuke:
Of, My Lord...Mr Nash Skulkin!
Judge:
Well I never!
EEEEEEEEEH?!
BLIMEEEEEEY?!
Meeeeeeeeeeee?
'Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiim?
Judge:
Very well then. Bailiff! Restrain the witness and conduct a thorough search of his personal effects!
Gregson:
Hold it!
Gregson:
...Please, My Lord!
Judge:
Inspector?
Gregson:
Scotland Yard, erm...has to object to this search!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Unfortunately for you, Inspector...your objections carry no weight here.
Gregson:
Eh?
Van Zieks:
In this courtroom, only the prosecution and the defence have the authority to object.
Gregson:
But, but Lord van Zieks...
Van Zieks:
I have no idea what forces are in play that might influence your actions... ...but personally, I have no intention of obstructing the course of this trial.
Gregson:
Agh!
Judge:
Bailiff! Carry out the search!
Nash:
Now 'old on a mo! I, I dun't know nuffin'! N-Nuffin' about no disk... C-CUT IT OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUT!!!
AAAAAAAAAH! Here, My Lord! In, in the witness's pocket... I found this!
Judge:
Good Lord! That's...
Van Zieks:
...Another music box disk.
Nash:
I dun't know nuffin' about it! Nuffin'!
Gregson:
.........
Graydon:
.........
Ryunosuke:
That is the second music box disk left behind by Magnus McGilded. Is it not...Inspector Gregson?!
Gregson:
Urgh... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Mr Skulkin, what have you to say for yourself?
Nash:
Gordon Bennett! I mean, just...Gordon flamin' Bennett! I swear I didn't know nuffin' about that disk! Honest to God!
Judge:
Counsel, would you please explain what exactly is going on here? The alleged deal that was struck was between this witness... ...and this detective, no?
Ryunosuke:
Without question, My Lord.
Judge:
Then for pity's sake... ...why on earth was this man in possession of the disk that the inspector traded for information?
Ryunosuke:
Inspector Gregson is a shrewd, calculating man who rarely loses his composure. But at one particular point in this trial, he exhibited some unusual behaviour for a brief moment.
Judge:
I don't recall. What unusual behaviour?
Gregson:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
It was...yes, during my cross-examination of Mr Graydon.
Ryunosuke:
Tell me, Mr Graydon, when you left the pawnbrokery that night... ...was it by any chance with the second disk in your jacket pocket?
Graydon:
I admit to nothing of the sort.
Ryunosuke:
While Mr Graydon answered my questions... ...the inspector appeared to have grabbed Nash Skulkin by his coat and was shaking him violently.
Nash:
Yeah! 'E did an' all! Thought me noggin woz gonna fall clean off, I did! I woz wishin' I'd been born as me bruvver, I woz!
Ryunosuke:
And what exactly happened to make the detective attack you like that?
Nash:
I ain't got a clue! 'E just suddenly turned an' grabbed me whistle like that an' started shakin' me! 'Why the blazes didn't ya mention the third gun when we got ya down the station?' That's wot 'e said. Yelled it right down my ear 'ole, 'e did! Me 'ead's still throbbin' now!
Judge:
Hm...
Ryunosuke:
The way the detective behaved then was extremely out of character. But looking back now...it must have been then that he did it. That was the opportunity Inspector Gregson created for himself in order to hide the disk.
Judge:
Well bless my wig! He hid it?!
Gregson:
You...
Judge:
But I'm afraid I fail to comprehend the motive here. If the detective had acquired the disk he was after... ...why on earth would he then proceed to hide it in another man's pocket? This is a court of law! He could have submitted the item as evidence.
Van Zieks:
It would appear, My Lord, that the inspector was not at liberty to do that.
Judge:
Whyever not?
Van Zieks:
As the man himself revealed himself earlier, his current assignment has some...special conditions.
Gregson:
......... My orders were: Recover the medium used to convey the secrets leaked from the ministry... ...and do it on the q.t. Strictly hush-hush.
Judge:
'Hush-hush'? A top-secret assignment, is it?
Van Zieks:
As far as we're aware, the information stolen comes from confidential government communications. It would seem that if that information were to be revealed in court as evidence, it would be...problematic. ...Does that sum up the situation, Inspector?
Gregson:
......... I'm operatin' under direct orders from the ministry. I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to answer that question.
Van Zieks:
So...realising there was a chance that you may be searched here in court... ...you took steps to hide the disk you had acquired from the witness.
Judge:
Ah! Does this mean...?
Ryunosuke:
He only pretended to attack Mr Skulkin in order to get close enough to him... ...to slip the second disk into his pocket.
Judge:
So it was all a pretence?
Gregson:
.........
Graydon:
.........
Judge:
Well now, Inspector Gregson... And you, Mr Graydon... ...are you prepared to admit to the accusation made against you of this alleged deal?
Graydon:
......... ...Admit to it? Yours truly? Please...
Ryunosuke:
Mr Graydon!
Graydon:
Clearly our Eastern visitor has an uncommonly active imagination. However, there's no proof that I passed that disk to the inspector.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But! But then... ...how do you explain the reason why you knew about the peephole?
Graydon:
I'm under no obligation to explain.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Graydon:
Yes, I lied in my testimony. That I admit, so sentence me accordingly. But that is all I admit. Murder...? Leaking government secrets...? Striking a deal with the detective...? All of it is this young Eastern man's fancy. I have no idea what any of that is about!
Ryunosuke:
You... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! Well, what about you then, Inspector Gregson? Do you admit to making a deal with Mr Graydon in order to acquire the disk?
Gregson:
...Ladies and gents of the jury... ...as a Scotland Yard inspector, I will declare this and nothin' more:
Juror No. 1:
...!
Gregson:
I am actin' in the best interests of the country. Whatever I've done, it's been in the name of justice.
Juror No. 2:
...!
Juror No. 3:
...!
Gregson:
So, as members of the public of this fine country... ...I'd like to think that justice will be your guidin' light when you're makin' your decisions.
Juror No. 4:
...!
Juror No. 5:
...!
Juror No. 6:
...!
Judge:
Hmmm... This is quite a quandary indeed. Rarely have I encountered such extraordinary tumultuousness in the concluding of a trial. Nevertheless, in the absence of any further evidence to be presented... ...I believe it is time that we put the matter to the jury for their final leanings.
Juror No. 1:
Well now...as a fellow servant of Queen and country, I must say I sympathise with the old inspector.
Juror No. 2:
Yes, he's a dependable man, I'm quite sure. In service, one becomes a good judge of character.
Juror No. 3:
Even crossing your eyes doesn't help when it comes to looking at this case. It's all blurred to me...
Juror No. 4:
Well, as a fellow professional, I'd like to put my faith in the detective, really.
Juror No. 5:
Graydon is highly skilled operator! Stop. Currently in presence of idol! Stop.
Juror No. 6:
...Detective has wery much trust in eyes. More than this, I cannot say.
Ryunosuke:
(I don't believe it! These six jurors are... They're going to believe Gregson! If they declare their decision now...)
Iris:
Is Ginny going to be found guilty?
Ryunosuke:
If I don't manage to produce some definitive evidence right now, then...we're going to lose! Either some proof that Graydon killed Mr Windibank or stole those government secrets... Or some evidence to force Gregson into admitting that he struck a deal with the witness...
Judge:
Well then, Counsel... ...I think it's time I imposed on the jurors to declare their final decisions, no? That is, unless you have some compelling evidence you have thus far not presented to the court?
Ryunosuke:
(If I let the judge call on the jurors to announce their leanings, Gina will be found guilty.)
Iris:
So there's no choice then, Runo! You have to throw some more evidence at them!
Ryunosuke:
(This is it now. It all comes down to this... Who do I present evidence against? Gregson...or Graydon...?)
Graydon
Ryunosuke:
Mr Graydon... ...there is one final piece of evidence I would like you to see.
Graydon:
Hmph, you misguided fool. Whatever you intend to show me now, you'll be wasting your time. I have nothing left to lose. I assure you, I will admit to nothing.
Ryunosuke:
(This is my last chance. It looks like I'm going to have to force his hand here. One final piece of evidence to get him to admit to the deal he clearly struck on the stand.)
Present Music Box Disk
Ryunosuke:
Judge:
Is that...Mr McGilded's music box disk, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. The first disk of two, which has already been placed in Mr McGilded's special music box ready to play.
Leads to:
"I think perhaps now would be a good time to listen to the sound produced by the music box again."
Present Small Music Box
Ryunosuke:
Judge:
Is that...Mr McGilded's peculiar music box, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. With a disk already in place ready to play.
Leads to:
"I think perhaps now would be a good time to listen to the sound produced by the music box again."
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Judge:
......... What on earth is this, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Irrefutable proof, My Lord...of the corrupt dealings that went on between these two men.
Van Zieks:
Or perhaps... ...irrefutable proof of the corrupt workings of my learned friend's mind.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh.
Judge:
Really, Counsel, at this stage in the proceedings, I would have expected a more considered argument. The defence will be duly penalised!
Ryunosuke:
UWAAAAAAAAAH! (They only struck that deal at the very last possible moment when they were in the stand. What's more, there's no love lost between them, clearly. It was strictly business...)
Iris:
If you think about it, murder and treason are both such serious crimes...
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Punishable by death.
Iris:
So I don't think old Silky's going to admit to either any time soon, do you?
Ryunosuke:
No. But Gregson, on the other hand... He is just refusing to admit to what happened because he's been sworn to secrecy. Out of a sense of duty.
Iris:
......... I wonder... If Gregsy's lips are sealed because he's determined to do his duty, then perhaps to prise them open... ...you're going to have to be determined enough to do your duty too, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
...! (Of course! He'd do anything to follow his orders, so...)
Judge:
The jury has indicated its readiness to declare its final findings. I urge you to consider this as your own final deed in this trial, Counsel.
Leads back to:
"This is my last chance."
Inspector Gregson
Ryunosuke:
Inspector Gregson... ...there is one final piece of evidence I would like you to see.
Gregson:
Eh? ...What's that then?
Ryunosuke:
If you refuse to acknowledge that you did in fact strike a deal with the witness here today... ...then you leave us no choice but to examine this piece of evidence...thoroughly.
Gregson:
Well, go on...
Ryunosuke:
(This is my last chance. It looks like I'm going to have to force his hand here. One final piece of evidence to get this detective to admit to the deal he clearly struck with Graydon.)
Present Music Box Disk
Ryunosuke:
Judge:
Is that...Mr McGilded's music box disk, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. The first disk of two, which has already been placed in Mr McGilded's special music box ready to play.
Leads to:
"I think perhaps now would be a good time to listen to the sound produced by the music box again."

Irrefutable proof, My Lord...of the corrupt dealings that went on between these two men.
Van Zieks:

Ryunosuke:
Ugh.

Judge:
The jury has indicated its readiness to declare its final findings. I urge you to consider this as your own final deed in this trial, Counsel.
Leads back to:
"This is my last chance."
Leave it to the jury
Ryunosuke:
(I can't possibly decide this.) I think...all I can do is leave it in the jury's capable hands at this sta-
???:
No, Runo!
Iris:
Look how far we've come! This is the final stretch! You need to pick the most explosive piece of evidence, and throw it at the weakest witness! Hard!
Van Zieks:
Just before you do... ...you deserve an explosive punishment for that weakest of decisions.
Ryunosuke:
...! (This will be the final blow. I need to decide where to place it for myself...)
Judge:
Your answer then, please, Counsel!
Leads back to:
"This is it now."
Ryunosuke:
I think perhaps now would be a good time to listen to the sound produced by the music box again. Only this time... ...with the second disk we've just discovered set in place as well!
Judge:
Goodness! This disk, Counsel?
Gregson:
Hold it!
Gregson:
No! Wait! I, I can't let you do that!
Ryunosuke:
Why not?
Gregson:
B-Because, um... Well! Because it's got nothin' to do with this case, that's why!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Not true, Inspector!
Gregson:
Eh?!
Ryunosuke:
The defence has already proposed... ...that the sounds heard by the court earlier from this music box were part of a Morse code message.
Graydon:
...!
Ryunosuke:
We know that Morse code comprises of two distinct tones. The defence believes that the second disk contains the second tone needed to complete the message! And now we have a chance...to confirm that theory!
Gregson:
For cryin' out loud, sunshine! We're talkin' about state secrets here! If you go lettin' the whole courtroom hear confidential information like that, it's...it's treason!
Ryunosuke:
Then do you admit the charge? That in order to protect those state secrets, you engaged in unlawful dealings with the witness?
Gregson:
You're... You're mad... If you let that secret information out into the public domain... ...you'll...you'll be makin' an enemy of the entire British government, you idiot!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Let's not forget, Inspector, that you - a Scotland Yard officer - leaked confidential case details to a witness! That you continue to lie to the court! And all because, by fair means or foul, you're determined to do your duty. Well...by fair means or foul, I'm prepared to do mine!
Gregson:
Don't you dare...
Ryunosuke:
I will stop at nothing to protect my client! I don't care who I make an enemy of!
Van Zieks:
.........
Ryunosuke:
My Lord! If you please! The court must hear the sounds made by that music box!
Gregson:
Come on, van Zieks! For Pete's sake! Stop 'im!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Inspector, you should know my methods by now. I'm a prosecutor. ...I'm no Scotland Yard puppet.
Gregson:
Ugrk...
Van Zieks:
In this courtroom, my duty is to the law. So let me propose a toast. To uncovering the truth...by fair means or foul.
Gregson:
NOOOOOOOOO!!!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Judge:
Very well, the defence's stance here and that of the prosecution has been made very clear, I feel. Therefore...in accordance with the defence's request... ...the court will now listen as this music box is set in operation once more. This time...with the second disk in place, and both disks playing simultaneously...
.........
Oh, listen to that... It's...it's unmistakable now... It's Morse code!
???:
Hold it!
Gregson:
Alright, alright! I admit it! Whatever you want! But for the love of God... ...shut that bloomin' box up!!!
.........
Ryunosuke:
Let me ask you again then, Inspector Gregson... Did you, or did you not, strike a deal with the witness next to you in the stand, Mr Ashley Graydon?
Judge:
Specifically, did you furnish the witness with confidential case details in exchange for this music box disk? Did you reveal the existence of the peephole in the pawnbroker's storeroom door, Inspector?
Gregson:
......... I did.
Graydon:
...! Stop! What are you doing, man?
Gregson:
......... It's all exactly like the young Eastern lawyer said. When the trial resumed after the recess, and we were stood here in the stand together... ...that's when he approached me with the deal.
Graydon:
Shut up, you imbecile! SHUT UP!!!
Psst, you there... You're the detective who turned up at the pawnbrokery the other day, aren't you? I may have something you're looking for, Inspector. With me at this very moment. So how about a trade? I suggest you accept... ...or information that may make certain individuals uncomfortable will soon become very public indeed.
Gregson:
I couldn't let that information become public knowledge. Not under any circumstances. So I accepted the man's proposal, and told him details about the case that should've put him in the clear. The peephole in the storeroom door...and the bloodstains on the overcoat.
Ryunosuke:
By giving false testimony, this witness intended to have the defendant wrongly accused of murder. Inspector, you knew that! Yet you still revealed those details to facilitate the witness's perjury!
Gregson:
......... I did. But then it turned out the peephole had only been made that night, after the incident took place. Scotland Yard wasn't aware of that, if I'm perfectly honest.
Ryunosuke:
Well, Mr Graydon? What do you have to say for yourself?
Graydon:
Uh...ugh...
Ryunosuke:
There's nothing and no one left for you to hide behind. You struck a deal with the inspector in order to escape conviction of a very serious crime. Namely this... You are the third intruder who broke into the pawnbrokery on the night in question... ...and YOU perpetrated the murder of the proprietor, Mr Pop Windibank!
Graydon:
Nrgh... You... You... TRAITOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR!!!
Judge:
Bailiff! BAILIFF!!! Restrain that man! At once!
(That's it then. It's all over...)
...........................
..................
.........
I despised my life growing up. Those slums are vile places. I was cursed from birth. Born into poverty, the son of a penniless artisan. My parents did nothing but quarrel all day long. What little money they had was never spent on me.
Graydon:
So I set about studying. To better myself. To one day escape from that hellhole.
Judge:
And you eventually became a communications officer. ...I admire your determination.
Ryunosuke:
But then you decided to try to sell government secrets? Why?
Graydon:
......... Isn't it obvious? Because I wanted money. Even now, years later, the nightmares of my life in the slums wake me in the small hours. I wanted to drown them out. With more money than anyone who lived in that squalor could ever imagine. Then one day, I met him. Mr Magnus McGilded.
McGilded:
Yer a feen with a quare talent, so you are. I've money to throw yer way if yer interested. All ye need to do...is go along with me little plan now.
Graydon:
I was to steal the ministry's telegraphic message logs and McGilded would buy them for a handsome sum. As I was responsible for inspections of the ministry's communications office, it was a simple enough task.
Van Zieks:
The lure of the devil's offerings... How easy it is to succumb.
Judge:
But you must surely have realised the seriousness of the crime you were committing.
Graydon:
And for that reason, I took great lengths to ensure that my actions were untraceable.
Van Zieks:
By using the music box.
Graydon:
......... My father was a brickmaker. Though my mother divorced him when I was still a child.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, Mr Mason Milverton.
Graydon:
That's right. He was very skilled with his hands. He'd once been a music box maker's apprentice. I imagined his skills would be sufficient to create a machine that could generate Morse code. So I sought out my father again...to employ his services. It was the first time I'd seen him since I left the slums ten years earlier.
'Look at you, Ashley. What a fine gent you've become, eh?'
Graydon:
He was a different man to the one in my memory. A thin, frail old man. But poverty had never broken him. Never corrupted him like it had me. I was sure that he wouldn't help me if I told him the real reason. So I made up a story.
'I've got some work for you, Father. I need some music box disks made.'
'Music box disks, eh?'
'A musician friend of mine has written some music he wants to sell to the public. I've brought the score with me. There are two, actually.'
'I'd be delighted, son. ...It's been twenty years since I did any work like this, though. Fetch my tools, would you? They're in the loft.'
Graydon:
That's how I had him make the two disks.
Van Zieks:
Thereby splitting the information in two... You were taking considerable precautions indeed.
Graydon:
It was to protect myself as much as anything. It meant that I could deal with McGilded in two separate transactions. The first involved the first of the two disks and the music box for playing them. I exchanged them with McGilded for ten guineas. Then, on receipt of the second disk, he would pay a thousand guineas.
Ryunosuke:
So...what happened on the omnibus two months ago... ...was the second part of a deal? The exchange of the second disk?
Graydon:
Yes. I'd sold the man information that way a number of times already. But it seems he became reluctant to part with his money.
Judge:
But that doesn't quite make sense, Mr Graydon. For why was it that on the omnibus two months ago... ...your father, Mr Milverton, was the one dealing with Mr McGilded and not yourself?
Graydon:
When I received the thousand guineas after my first completed dealings with McGilded... ...I decided to give two hundred to my father for his troubles.
But my father realised something was amiss. In time, he worked out that I must be involved in something...dubious. And when he did, he said to me:
'Next time there's an exchange, you'll let your old man do it, understand? Otherwise I won't take your money any more.'
.........
Graydon:
...That was my father's way of dealing with it, I suppose. 'Climb into the omnibus, hand over the second disk, and take the money from McGilded. That's it.' He had no idea what was actually on the disks I'd asked him to make. He never knew. ...Just like I'll never know why everything went so horribly wrong that night. All I know is that the disk was taken from him... and he never returned home.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
.........
Graydon:
It was only then that I found out what sort of a monster McGilded really was. So after ten years of not once uttering it, I swore on my father's name... ...to exact revenge.
Ryunosuke:
Revenge?!
Van Zieks:
...As anyone with even the remotest knowledge of the man will no doubt be able to imagine... ...McGilded brought all his wealth and influence to bear in the most despicable of ways... ...to crush any semblance of justice in his trial.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
The crime scene was tampered with, evidence was fixed, and witnesses were bribed. That trial two months ago was a farce from start to finish.
Ryunosuke:
(My feet had barely touched British soil back then. And I walked into that hornets' nest, completely unaware of the sinister background to it all...)
Graydon:
I'd made plenty of money out of my dealings with McGilded by then. So I spared nothing in my arrangements two months ago. I knew exactly who to hire. If you're willing to pay the price, there are people in this city willing to do anything you ask. McGilded himself had shown me that.
Ryunosuke:
Are, are you saying that...?
Graydon:
I think you have the picture now. After he twisted everything to his favour in this courtroom to ensure that he walked free... ...I took matters into my own hands...and delivered the justice that monster deserved!
That 'tragic accident' following the trial here two months ago... ...was planned and executed... by yours truly.
Ryunosuke:
(McGilded's death that day... ...was caused by this man!)
Bailiff:
Everything is ready, sir. If you'd like to follow me into the courtroom...
McGilded:
What's this, Officer? 'Tis sooner than I was led to believe.
Bailiff:
I hope it's not inconvenient, sir. There were some changes to the schedule.
McGilded:
Well, I must be makin' tracks now. 'Tis time for the inspection. They're goin' to examine the omnibus again, so I'm told. I asked if I could be present for it meself.
Ryunosuke:
So that policeman who came to tell McGilded he could examine the omnibus again...
Graydon:
That's right. An imposter, hired by me. McGilded used his wealth to manipulate the trial. He paid people to adulterate the omnibus with all manner of false evidence... He threatened witnesses to lie in their testimony... So I gave the man a taste of his own medicine. Once the omnibus was dowsed in paraffin... ...one of my sham policemen ushered McGilded inside... and sent him on a one-way journey to Hell. An eye...for an eye. That's how I avenged my father's death.
Judge:
...A spine-chilling account indeed.
Graydon:
But that wasn't the end of it for me. There was a loose end, you see.
Ryunosuke:
A loose end?
Graydon:
Yes. I should think it's obvious. The second disk, which my father had taken to exchange with McGilded.
Judge:
Ah...yes... There was indeed no mention of it in the man's trial two months ago. Clearly because it had been removed from the scene of the crime.
Graydon:
When I realised it was missing, I remembered something. Something from the first time I'd dealt with McGilded.
Graydon:
'This is the first of the two disks, and the music box you need to play them.'
McGilded:
'Well, look at that now. What an ingenious little invention. So then, as promised... Ten guineas for ye, young man.'
Graydon:
'Wh-What's this? "Windibank's Pawnbrokery"?'
McGilded:
'Aye, 'tis a pawnbroker's ticket, so it is. Ye can use it to redeem an article I've deposited there for ye. There's no need to give a name. Just hand over the ticket and tell the feen the watchword. I've put a jewel in pawn for ye. It'll fetch a good ten guineas if ye sell it, so it will.'
Graydon:
'...I've never heard of a pawnbrokery being used in quite that way before.'
McGilded:
'Have ye not, Mr Graydon? London's pawnbrokeries are very useful places, ye know. Each one is like an extremely secure vault.'
......................................................
Graydon:
So I knew that if he'd taken steps to hide the disk... ...it would be in that pawnbrokery somewhere. And that on the night he killed my father, he must have entrusted the ticket to someone.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, to Gina.) I remember now...that when we first met you at Windibank's that afternoon two days ago... ...you had a description of Miss Lestrade written down. How did you know who you were looking for?
Graydon:
From the trial. That pickpocket's testimony was clearly peculiar. Anyone could see that. I realised immediately that she was another of McGilded's pawns. That he must have threatened her somehow. I was fairly convinced it would be her who had the ticket. So I started to make some enquiries. I had a strong suspicion the girl would come out of the woodwork on the redemption deadline.
Ryunosuke:
(And he was absolutely right.)
Graydon:
And yes, sure enough, she did. All I needed to do was to wait until the girl went to Windibank's to redeem the articles. But unfortunately, she redeemed only McGilded's overcoat and the one disk that was in its pocket. The all-important music box with the second disk inside was missing.
Van Zieks:
Because it had already been forfeited two days earlier.
Graydon:
But I was unaware of that fact. Had I not been, I could have avoided my night-time excursion.
Gregson:
Meanwhile, as our investigation into the stolen government secrets was progressin'... ...we'd picked up on the fact that McGilded was involved.
Ryunosuke:
Inspector! (You've recovered fast!)
Gregson:
My orders were to recover the stolen information as quickly as possible. So we started gatherin' the fella's possessions and examinin' whatever we could lay our hands on. We had a full-scale investigation goin' on at the Yard, but we had to keep it as quiet as we could.
Graydon:
Then, when the inspector here took the disk from me in the pawnbrokery that day, I become [sic] nervous. I was sure the music box and the second disk were still there in the shop somewhere. So I knew that it was a race against time. I had to find those articles before the police did.
Ryunosuke:
So that's what prompted you to break into the place that same night... ...with the help of your old friends, the Skulkin brothers.
Graydon:
......... What happened that night in the pawnbrokery...I can only describe as a nightmare. While Nash and Ringo were searching the counter... ...I'd located the music box I'd sold to McGilded on the shelves of forfeited articles.
Van Zieks:
And the second disk was inside?
Graydon:
Yes. I slipped it into my pocket with a very deep sigh of relief. But then something entirely unexpected happened.
'What are you doing in my shop?!'
*BANG!*
Graydon:
A gunshot rang out in the shop, and I felt a sharp pain in my left arm.
Van Zieks:
The broker fired his gun, and the bullet pierced your limb.
Graydon:
Yes, exactly. But unfortunately... ...I'd decided to bring my own gun with me that night. Just in case.
Ryunosuke:
...!
*BANG!*
Graydon:
Before I knew what was happening, I'd fired back. The man had already turned to flee. I hadn't intended to fire in his direction, much less kill him. But unfortunately for both of us...the bullet hit home. It struck him in the middle of his back as he fled through the storeroom door for refuge.
Judge:
A sorry, sorry tale...
Graydon:
It all took place in the blink of an eye. I don't imagine Nash and Ringo even realised what had happened at first. I was terrified...so I fled. And that's the whole story. That's everything that happened at Windibank's on that wretched night.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
.........
...........................
Van Zieks:
Earlier, you called McGilded a monster. A man who used his wealth and influence to distort the facts and escape justice for the crime of murder. What tragic irony... For what you have done...is exactly the same.
Graydon:
.........
Van Zieks:
You've become the very monster you saw, and despised so deeply, in McGilded.
Graydon:
......... Yes...I think I have.
Judge:
Well...this has been a long and exhausting trial. However, it would seem that at last we have arrived at the truth. Inspector Gregson...what of Mr Ashley Graydon?
Gregson:
He's been restrained, My Lord, and is bein' escorted to the Yard. He'll be charged with the murder of Mr Windibank... ...and the stealin' of government secrets.
Judge:
Very good. And you, Inspector. Regrettably, you will have to face charges yourself.
Gregson:
...Yes, My Lord. Of course.
Van Zieks:
It transpires that you were complicit in helping a criminal escape justice. That fact remains, whether or not you were doing so in the line of duty. ...The crime is a serious one, Inspector. And inexcusable.
Gregson:
.........
Judge:
Now to the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade...
Gina:
Ah! ...Yeah?
Judge:
It is time for the final adjudication. Is the jury ready, Mr Foreman?
Juror No. 1:
Yessir! Garrideb Squadron standing by, sir! This is really it now... The last push! The final call! The finishing whistle! My men are ready to deliver their verdicts!
Judge:
Thank you, Mr Foreman. Very well, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will now declare your final decisions to the court!
Juror No. 1:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 2:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 3:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 4:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 5:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 6:
Not guilty!
Gina:
Hahaha! That's the stuff! I'm off the 'ook!
Iris:
Finally, Runo! You finally managed to do it!
Ryunosuke:
Finally is the word. I really wasn't sure if we'd come out on top for a while there.
Iris:
Susie was right. You're the best lawyer in the world!
Judge:
Miss Lestrade. I am not finished with you yet.
Gina:
Eh?! Wot, wot are ya lookin' at me like that for?
Judge:
Before you start enjoying your freedom, there are certain other crimes to consider, hm?
Gina:
Eh?
Judge:
Two months ago - in my courtroom, no less - you gave false testimony, did you not? And in relation to the trial today, not only did you unlawfully enter Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...you also attempted to abscond with Mr McGilded's property, it seems.
Gina:
EEEH?! I never done nuffin' o' the sort!
Ryunosuke:
(Of course not. It's not like you were gleefully wearing McGilded's coat in your cell yesterday or anything...)
Iris:
Aww... And just when I was getting excited about throwing a party for Ginny this evening...
Judge:
And turning our attention to the defence... Determining that, when played together, the music box disks contained a message in Morse code was... Well, it was certainly a most unexpected revelation, Counsel.
Van Zieks:
Quite so, My Lord. The prosecution was caught entirely off guard. In fact, I think we should applaud my learned friend's courage here today. I propose a toast. To demanding that government secrets be disseminated before the entire courtroom!
Ryunosuke:
Ah! V-Very sorry about that. It was the only way that I could get Inspector Gregson to admit to what he'd done, so...
???:
If, if I may say something on that point...
Ryunosuke:
(Isn't that...?)
Juror No. 5:
It's, um, about the sounds produced by the music box before. I do wonder...if that was really Morse code at all.
Ryunosuke:
What...what are you saying, madam?
Juror No. 5:
Oh, well, it's just that I'm really rather fanatical when it comes to Morse code, you see. So much so that the whole world seems to be covered in dots and dashes to me, in fact.
Judge:
Goodness, madam. An unhealthy level of obsession, one feels.
Juror No. 5:
But I must say that in my opinion, the sounds produced by those two disks... ...were nothing more than that. A meaningless serious [sic] of two different tones.
Ryunosuke:
Wha... WHAAAAAAT?! (Can, can that really be? It...wasn't Morse code after all?!)
Iris:
.........
Ryunosuke:
My Lord! The defence would like to listen to the music box again!
Gregson:
Are you off your nut?! How many times do I have to tell you, those disks contain ministerial secrets, sunshine?!
Van Zieks:
This courtroom is not an appropriate forum to discuss the nature of the government communications. We know McGilded conspired to trade national secrets with our enemies. Secrets acquired from Mr Graydon. Now that the man has admitted to his crimes, we have no need to pursue the matter further.
Ryunosuke:
...! (Ugh...but it's really going to bother me!)
Iris:
.........
Judge:
Miss Lestrade...
Gina:
Yeah...Me Lord?
Judge:
That which you have seen today here in this courtroom has been extremely disturbing.
Van Zieks:
Falsified evidence...intimidation...perjury... A grim catalogue of depravity.
Judge:
An appalling experience to befall any child.
Gina:
Come on. It ain't nuffin' I dun't see most days in the back slums.
Judge:
I beg your pardon?
Gina:
If yer weak, ye pay for it. That's just 'ow life goes.
Ryunosuke:
Gina...
Gina:
......... But look, I reckon I've worked somefin' out today. The world ain't fair, but if ya want it to change... ...you've gotta start at 'ome. You've gotta change 'ow you are yerself.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Judge:
Well, that's a very laudable lesson, I would say. I eagerly look forward to the born-again Miss Lestrade never gracing my courtroom with her presence again.
Gina:
.........
Judge:
Now...with regard to the murder of Mr Pop Windibank, proprietor of a pawnbrokery business on Baker Street... ...I hereby declare the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade...
Not Guilty
Judge:
That is all. Court is adjourned!
Van Zieks:
On a personal note, I must say you've surprised me, my Far Eastern friend.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...oh!
Van Zieks:
Despite being a Nipponese, you saw through the pretence to the malice that festered within that Englishman. And at the same time, saw through the grime to the surprising heart of your English client. You have a curious talent for judging character, especially considering our very different cultures.
Ryunosuke:
......... I don't think there's anything curious about it.
Van Zieks:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Whether we're from the Empire of Great Britain...or the Empire of Japan... ...we're all human beings. We're not so very different on the inside.
Van Zieks:
......... You know, I took this case for one very simple reason. To lock swords with you once again here in the courtroom.
Ryunosuke:
You did?
Van Zieks:
When I encountered you for the first time two months ago, it reminded me... ...of toasting friendship and trust with another Nipponese...only to find my trust betrayed. Through you, I hoped to look into the eyes of the man I once knew...and try to understand.
Ryunosuke:
......... You mentioned something similar earlier today - about 'total betrayal' at the hands of the Japanese. What happened exactly?
Van Zieks:
......... Well you may ask. And one day, when the time comes, you will learn the answer, whether you like it or not.
Ryunosuke:
......... Alright, then I'll wait for that day, if I must.
Van Zieks:
Coming to be known as the Reaper of the Bailey, and my retirement from service five years ago... It gives me cause to wonder...if our meeting has some deeper purpose... So...farewell, my Nipponese fellow. Until we meet again.
17th April, 5:24 p.m.
The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber
Ryunosuke:
(It's done... It's over at last... ......... But... ...where's Iris disappeared to?) Ah... Congratulations, Gina! ...I knew it all along. I knew that you were innocent.
Gina:
......... Well...you did wot ya said, Mr Narra-'Oddo. Ya believed in me. Right up to the end. ...Yer as odd as yer name.
Ryunosuke:
What's odd about it? I told you I had faith in you, didn't I?
Gina:
......... No one ever 'as before, see. Kept a promise, I mean. Properly.
Ryunosuke:
That's awful...
Gina:
I've figured somefin' out today. All me life, growin' up in the slums, I've never trusted no one. But that's just cos I've been scared of bein' stabbed in the back. I mean, the more ya trust someone, the more it 'urts when they let ya down.
Ryunosuke:
......... Yes...I think I can understand that. (After all, I had a taste of it in that trial two months ago. I chose to trust someone, and paid for it. That betrayal left a big scar...) You know, though, Gina, I worked something out quite recently, too. Trusting in someone else is...really an exercise in learning to trust yourself. (And when your gut tells you it's the right thing to do, and your trust is rewarded... ...there's no better feeling in the world.) I think I have you to thank for reminding me of that valuable lesson.
Gina:
Oh...well...if ya say so. Don't make a fat lot o' sense to me, though.
Ryunosuke:
I'm trying to say...that putting my faith in you, Gina, has been a real pleasure.
Gina:
For cryin' out loud, pack it in! ......... But I s'pose... ...I sort of feel the same way. I mean...sometimes trustin' someone else is...ya know... alright.
Ryunosuke:
...Thanks.
Kazuma:
'This is the way I see it, Ryunosuke... A defence lawyer is only as good as his faith in his client. And that comes down to how much faith he has...in himself.'
.........
Ryunosuke:
After this experience...I'm starting to feel like I understand what you mean. Kazuma... ...am I living up to your expectations? Am I turning out to be the lawyer you believed I could be?
Kazuma:
.........
???:
Pardon the interruption... ...but what the deuce does a man have to do to be noticed around here...my dear fellow?
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Th-That voice!
???:
It's too late for 'th-that voice' now...Mr Naruhodo! I've been standing here patiently in the corner of the room for an eternity! 'Ah ha ha! Yes, it was me all along!' I would have said when finally you noticed me.
Sholmes:
But you people! With your incessant babbling!
Gina:
Aah! M-Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
'Ah ha ha! Yes, it was me all along!' ...You see?
Ryunosuke:
I'd, I'd assumed you'd been taken back to the hospital, to be honest.
Sholmes:
Indeed I was. ...But I managed to escape again!
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Sholmes:
I happen to be aware of one or two...foibles of the doctor who was tending to me. I merely made my knowledge of them known to the man, and he happily issued me with a leave of absence.
Ryunosuke:
...How very above board.
Sholmes:
But enough of my adventures. That was a fine victory, Mr Naruhodo. Your tireless efforts justly rewarded, I feel. Congratulations are in order! As a close friend, I tip my hat at you.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...um... Thank you.
Gina:
Hmph! Some great detective you are! Great at bein' cold as ice maybe!
Sholmes:
...Have I irked you in some way, Miss Lestrade?
Gina:
While you've been 'avin' a snooze in yer nice soft bed, some of us 'ave been fightin' for our lives!
Sholmes:
Ah well...that bullet did cause me to lose a substantial amount of blood, it's true. So I have indeed been feeling somewhat cold. Not perhaps as cold as ice, but... Well, have a feel.
Ryunosuke:
...Could you take your hands off my neck please, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
And...in some way, I suppose...congratulations are in order for you, too, Miss Lestrade.
Gina:
Wot's that s'posed to mean? Why so 'alf-'earted?
Sholmes:
Well, naturally it isn't my intention to alarm you, but... ...an acquittal in a trial with that particular prosecutor is perhaps a little...precarious.
Ryunosuke:
(Well done, Mr Sholmes. Not alarming in the slightest.)
Gina:
Oh... The Reaper, ya mean? Cos anyone who's found not guilty in a trial 'e was workin' on winds up dead anyway? Is that it?
Sholmes:
The very point I was trying to make! As exemplified by the fate of Mr McGilded, in fact. Ah, but of course...I pay no attention to such irrational drivel myself.
Gina:
......... Yeah, well...it don't bother me.
Sholmes:
Oh really?
Gina:
'Course not. The way I see it, the Reaper's a bit like 'Im upstairs.
Ryunosuke:
Him upstairs? You mean...like God?
Gina:
Yeah, 'Im upstairs knows wot's wot, right? 'E knows wot people are like on the inside. 'E won't 'ave got the wrong end o' the stick. There are some coves like that bogtrotter, wot are rotten to the core. At the end o' the day, 'Im upstairs makes sure they get wot they deserve.
Ryunosuke:
I...suppose that's one way of looking at it. Divine justice is one thing, though. The Reaper taking matters into his own hands and claiming lives is another.
Gina:
Well, I ain't like the McGildeds o' this world. So I ain't scared. ...I got principles, see.
Sholmes:
......... A trait in you which is to be admired, Miss Lestrade.
Gina:
Oi! Just give a rest, alright?
Sholmes:
As I was saying, congratulations are in order. The news of your acquittal...was very welcome news to me indeed. Let me express my heartfelt congratulations...Gina.
Gina:
......... Well, um...erm...
???:
THERE you are! Hurley! How long have you been here?
Iris:
Honestly! I went to the main entrance especially to meet you there!
Sholmes:
Ah, Iris, my dear, I do apologise. But wait until I tell you what happened! This pair made utter fools of themselves!
Iris:
What happened?
Sholmes:
As you know, I have a penchant for disguise. I was hiding in this room dressed as a bailiff. But these dolts didn't notice my presence at all! Ah ha ha ha hah! They had no idea! Can you imagine, Iris? Would you credit it?
Iris:
Hm...I'm not sure, really.
Sholmes:
I beg your pardon?
Iris:
I'm sorry, Hurley, but you just don't have the weighty presence you seem to think you have. In fact, you really ought to be careful about that. It's going to land you in trouble one day.
Sholmes:
...I'll be careful.
Ryunosuke:
(Ouch.)
Iris:
Anyway, it's such a shame. I was so hoping to throw a party for Ginny tonight. But...you won't be able to come, will you?
Gina:
Don't look like I'm gonna be goin' nowhere for a while. You 'eard the judge's patter. I got stuff to make amends for, apparently. All them 'offences'. Wot was it again? Breakin' an' enterin', takin' the bogtrotter's stuff wot was in lug, blah, blah, blah...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I think you'll find that basically, being a pickpocket is the main offence.
Gina:
But divin' ain't an offence! It's a job, innit?
Ryunosuke:
(I don't think so!)
Gina:
Still, it 'as got me thinkin', all this. Maybe I should start lookin' for another line o' work. I mean, you didn't start off as a lawyer, did ya, 'Oddo?
Ryunosuke:
Well no...but I was never a pickpocket.
Gina:
Well anyway, I reckon I could make a change. I'm gonna do somefin' for all them lot like me from the slums! Somefin' that makes a difference for 'em!
Iris:
That's a wonderful idea, Ginny! And I'm sure you can do it!
Gina:
...Heh heh heh...
Iris:
What is it?
Gina:
Nuffin'...
???:
Miss Gina Lestrade!
Bailiff:
The prison carriage has arrived, ma'am. Come with me to the rear gate at once.
Gina:
Right, well...looks like I'm off then.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Goodbye, Gina. And good luck.
Gina:
......... Um...erm...'Oddo...?
Ryunosuke:
Yes?
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! What, what was that for?!
Gina:
I, um...I dunno... I mean... ...I dunno wot to say, so...
Sholmes:
Ah, indeed... ...perhaps the situation calls for a phrase hitherto missing from your vocabulary, Miss Lestrade.
Gina:
Eh?
Sholmes:
On occasions such as this... ...I would recommend a simple 'thank you'.
Gina:
Oh...
Iris:
Oh yes! It's good advice, Ginny!
Gina:
Right, I see. Well... ......... .................. Tha... Thanks...'Oddo. Thank you for everyfin' wot you've done! For believin' in me!
Ryunosuke:
......... Not at all. In fact, that should be my line. ...Thank you, Gina.
Ryunosuke:
(Well, there she goes. I wonder if I'll ever see her again...)
Sholmes:
Well well, quite the indomitable pickpurse...
Iris:
Oh, I nearly forgot! I bought a paper outside. It's a special edition, and this trial is all over the front page! 'Pickpocket's Innocence Proven!' ...Isn't it wonderful?
Ryunosuke:
You should have shown it to Gina, Iris. She would have been thrilled.
Iris:
Oh no! How silly of me... Ah, but anyway...would you like the good news or the bad news?
Ryunosuke:
Ugh, not again.
Iris:
Well, what do you say, Runo? Hurley?
Ryunosuke:
As usual, I think I'd rather get the bad news out of the way first.
Sholmes:
Absolutely not! I have no intention of listening to anything but good news!
Iris:
And there you have it. ...How people answer that question says a lot about them, doesn't it?
Ryunosuke:
...Let's not go there.
Iris:
Alright then...maybe let's start with the good news this time. The rain hash finally stopped! It was a record level of rainfall, apparently.
Sholmes:
Well, that is good news indeed. We can journey back in greater comfort.
Ryunosuke:
Alright then...what's the bad news?
Iris:
The huge storm has left the seas very choppy. The Channel in particular is awful, so sailings out of Dover have been delayed by a day or more.
Ryunosuke:
Wait... (Dover?)
Iris:
That's right! If we head to the station immediately... ...we may still make it in time to wave Susie off!
Ryunosuke:
......... But, but... ...there won't be a train, surely? We couldn't be that lucky.
Sholmes:
Who do you think I am, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Mr...Sholmes?
Sholmes:
I rushed to Victoria station earlier and made arrangements for a special express! If we hurry now, we shall be there in time for dinner! And I know of a fine restaurant that serves the most delicious baked sole.
Ryunosuke:
I don't... The great detective does it again!
Sholmes:
Indeed he does! I happen to be aware of a number of the rail transport director's foibles.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Sholmes:
I merely made my knowledge of them known to the man, and he happily laid on the locomotive. Elementary!
Ryunosuke:
......... Just an idea, but it might be wise to stop manipulating people that way...
Iris:
What are we waiting for, then! To London Victoria!
18th April, 5:32 a.m.
Port of Dover, Quayside
Sholmes:
That took somewhat longer than I had anticipated.
Iris:
Susie's boat must be about to leave now.
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato... Where are you...? Over there! Look! (It looks like she's reading something.)
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato! Wait! What are you doing?
Susato:
Mr...Mr Naruhodo? What are you doing here?
Ryunosuke:
We came as soon as we could after the trial. I mean... ...we heard that sailings were being delayed due to the bad weather, you see.
Susato:
Oh, I... I see... Then! Then tell me! How did Gina's trial go?
Ryunosuke:
It...it went well. She was acquitted.
Susato:
......... That's wonderful. Really wonderful news.
Ryunosuke:
The book you were about to throw into the sea... It was your Encyclopaedia of British Law, wasn't it?
Susato:
Oh dear... I was hoping you hadn't seen that. ......... I'm not worthy of practising law in any way now. So...I was saying my final farewell.
Ryunosuke:
You were saying goodbye to law? (You? Susato-san?)
Sholmes:
Would I be correct in assuming... ...it's because of the peephole, Miss Susato?
Susato:
......... I deliberately altered the scene of a crime. And...then I tried to hide the fact. What I did is utterly unforgivable!
Iris:
That reminds me... ...how did you even come to have this, Susie?
Susato:
On the evening of the incident... ...Mr Sholmes had invited Gina to dinner, if you remember.
Iris:
Oh yes! We had a wonderful time!
Susato:
Well, Gina gave us a little introductory lesson, didn't she? To the art of pickpocketing, I mean.
Iris:
Oh, that was so much fun! I stole Runo's armband!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, please don't do that again, Iris. That band's very important to me.
Iris:
Well if it's so important, you should pay more attention to it! You didn't notice for ages!
Susato:
On a whim, I thought it would be fun to see if I could take the Cat-Flapomat. So I put it up my sleeve.
Iris:
Really?!
Susato:
And then I rather forgot about it...until I found myself in Mr Windibank's shop with it later that night.
Ryunosuke:
I, I see...
Susato:
And then...
*BANG!*
Susato:
AAAAAAAH!!! Mr Sholmes! Mr Shooolmes!!!
Sholmes:
Leave me, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Right!
Susato:
After Mr Naruhodo had left the shop, I started to think... That door started to play on my mind.
Ryunosuke:
The storeroom door, you mean?
Susato:
Yes. If Gina was anywhere in the shop, I realised it could only be behind that door. And at that moment, the little device that I had up my sleeve sprang to mind. I was so worried about Gina, I simply had to know.
Ryunosuke:
So...you used the Cat-Flapomat to make the peephole in the door.
Iris:
As captured in a photographic print of the shop... ...by one of Hurley's Red-Handed Recorders.
Sholmes:
Indeed, it was of the first importance, that point. Precisely when the peephole was made. That information would prove to be Mr Naruhodo's greatest weapon. Though naturally without proof, it would have amounted to nothing.
Susato:
But when I looked through the hole in the door... ...the sight that met my eyes made my blood run cold. Thoughts started to run through my mind. I remembered that trial two months earlier.
Ryunosuke:
The trial of Magnus McGilded.
Susato:
I thought about how he had manipulated the evidence and arranged false testimony to secure his freedom. It made the British justice system feel very dark and sinister to me. And then a terrible thought occurred to me. What if... What if some wicked criminal was planning to do the same thing now?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Susato:
Because from the appearance of the crime scene, it looked exactly as though Gina had shot Mr Windibank. Even though I was sure she would never have done such a thing...
Ryunosuke:
...You were worried that the true culprit would try to frame her for the crime?
Susato:
That's right. But then I realised... It would be very difficult for anyone to give false testimony in this case.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Susato:
Well, the crime appeared to have happened behind the door of a locked room. For someone to claim falsely to have witnessed it, there would have to be a way to see beyond the door.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Sholmes:
For which a peephole would be the very thing!
Susato:
Only the peephole I had made wasn't actually there until after the crime had been committed, of course. And the criminal would know that, so it wouldn't make any difference.
Sholmes:
But the possibility of a rather ingenious trap was there, was it not?
Ryunosuke:
A, a trap? (Is that why she did it?)
Iris:
So...is that why you kept it a secret, Susie? You never mentioned that you made the peephole to anyone. ...Not even to the police.
Susato:
I know. And I knew at the time what I was doing was wrong. A criminal offence, even. That's why I decided to confide in Mr Sholmes. If Mr Naruhodo was completely backed into a corner, with no other possible means of escape... ...the truth about the peephole could save him! That was my plan.
Ryunosuke:
(She really does think of everything...) But, but then... ...why didn't you just tell me everything before the trial began?
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, you're not thinking straight. If she had done that, it would have rendered you complicit in the whole escapade.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...
Sholmes:
You could have been disbarred if you had been seen to have knowingly tampered with a crime scene. So Miss Susato decided to shoulder the burden of responsibility alone. For your sake...and Miss Lestrade's.
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato...
Susato:
......... The truth is, when it happened...I did it because... ...I'd lost a little of my faith in the law.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Susato:
I was worried that the right person wouldn't be convicted of the crime. But the moment I allowed myself to think that... ...is the moment I lost my right to call myself a judicial assistant. .........
Ryunosuke:
......... What you did...isn't comparable to what he did. Graydon is the one who lied in the witness stand, using that peephole as a way to implicate Gina!
Susato:
...!
Ryunosuke:
And besides... ...if the peephole inconsistency hadn't existed... ...I'm not at all sure that she would have been acquitted in the end. Miss Susato, what you did...saved Gina's life!
Susato:
......... Well, with your kind words, Mr Naruhodo...you've saved me, too, from my regrets.
Sholmes:
Well, we must all be thankful that Miss Lestrade's freedom has been assured.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, exactly. Although some of the loose ends in that trial will continue to play on my mind, I'm sure.
Susato:
But the revelation that the music box disk contained secret messages, Mr Naruhodo! What a triumph to work that out! I'm full of admiration!
Ryunosuke:
Well actually...that argument wasn't quite as compelling as I thought it was.
Susato:
Oh! It wasn't?
Ryunosuke:
There was a communications officer among the jury members, you see. A telegraph operator. And she said that the majority of the sounds on the disk were just meaningless tones.
Sholmes:
As one would expect. After all, we are talking about secret government communications. No doubt they were written in cipher to avoid being readily understood should they have been intercepted.
Ryunosuke:
In cipher? I, I see... So then we could never have hoped to understand the message anyway.
Sholmes:
Nonsense, my dear fellow! It's quite a zero pipe problem, I assure you!
???:
...........................
.........A.........
...so...gi...?
Ryunosuke:
...! (...What?)
Iris:
Well...that can't be a real word, can it? How funny.
Susato:
Wait! Iris, what did you just say?
Iris:
Oh! Um...I just said, 'Asogi'. Does...that word mean something to you?
Ryunosuke:
Mean something? Asogi...was the name of my best friend!
Iris:
What?!
Susato:
But how?! How do you know that name, Iris?
Iris:
I wrote it down during the trial before. When the message was playing on the music box.
Ryunosuke:
(She transcribed it on the fly? She really is a genius!)
Iris:
I thought the message probably wouldn't be written out in plain Morse code, so I tried various ways to interpret it. But whatever I tried, the words just didn't seem to make any sense. That is...in English at least.
Susato:
Oh!
Iris:
It suddenly occurred to me, you see... There's more than one Morse code. Not just the English variety. Various countries around the world have altered and added to Morse code to use it in their own languages.
Ryunosuke:
I, I don't believe it! Are you saying...?
Iris:
That's right. I've only actually seen a chart of Japanese Morse code once before. But I think it's based on the i-ro-ha pangram, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
And you mean to say that in Japanese Morse code, the message says 'Asogi'?
Iris:
Yes, I think so. ...Sorry, but I don't remember all of the Japanese Morse code.
Susato:
Iris, would you let me see that?
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato! Do you know it? Do you know Japanese Morse code?
Susato:
Yes! I spent some time studying it. Because I'm quite sure Morse code will become ever more important for international communications!
Sholmes:
Then might I recommend, my dear madam, that you focus your efforts on the English version?
Susato:
Be that as it may! Iris, show me the message, please!
Iris:
Of course!
Susato:
......... .................. But, but what can this possibly mean...?
Ryunosuke:
(Whatever is in that long sequence of supposedly meaningless dots and dashes... ...it's made the colour drain from Susato-san's face.)
Susato:
......... There's no doubt that this message is written in Japanese Morse code.
Ryunosuke:
So the British Empire has been using Japanese for its secret communications?
Susato:
I don't understand the reason why, but... ...the message appears to be a list of four people's names.
Ryunosuke:
Four names?
Susato:
The first...is 'K. Asogi'.
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma Asogi... (Why? Why was his name on that disk?)
Susato:
The second...is 'A. Shin'.
Ryunosuke:
Shin? I don't recognise that name.
Susato:
The third...is 'T. Gureguson'.
Ryunosuke:
Guregu... Gregson?!
Sholmes:
Ah, it would seem Tobias Gregson is the third man on the list.
Ryunosuke:
(And what's HIS name doing in a secret government communication as well?)
Susato:
And the last name... .........
Ryunosuke:
What's the matter, Miss Susato?
Susato:
It's...it's just so strange... So unexpected...
Iris:
Oh! What is it, Susie! Don't keep us in suspense!
Susato:
......... The last name...is 'J. Wilson'.
Iris:
What?!
Ryunosuke:
Wilson?
Iris:
John H. Wilson? You mean...Daddy?
Sholmes:
.........
Susato:
It says only 'J. Wilson', so I'm afraid I can't be sure. Then, after the four names, it reads - if I translate from Japanese - 'That is all four...' And that's the end of the message. Or rather, the end of what you noted down, Iris.
Iris:
.........
Ryunosuke:
I just can't believe it. Who would ever have thought... ...that those disks contained Japanese Morse code? (Not to mention a strange list of some disturbingly familiar names...)
Sholmes:
It would appear that this particular message... ...is a communication of some kind between Great Britain and the Empire of Japan.
Iris:
So...Daddy could be in Japan then. Where Susie and Runo come from!
Susato:
Oh! Well...
Iris:
Hm, no... It's not very likely really, is it? I mean, there are thousands of people with the surname Wilson, and there must be lots of 'J's among them.
Ryunosuke:
......... (Professor John H. Wilson, visiting professor of medicine at the Imperial Yumei University... But we can't tell Iris about that now. We just can't.) This is so strange. Somehow, in solving the case of Mr Windibank's murder today... ...I feel like I've rolled back a boulder at the mouth of a very dark cave...
Susato:
......... I do wonder... ...if perhaps it's a dark cave that we shouldn't go wandering inside.
Ryunosuke:
.........
*HOOOOOONK*
Susato:
Oh dear...the ship is going to set sail soon.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...it seems so.
Susato:
I'll sail on that steamship first to the Port of Dunkirk in France. Then I'll change onto a larger passenger vessel bound for Japan.
Iris:
You're really going then, Susie...
Sholmes:
We wish you a safe passage, Miss Susato.
Susato:
Thank you so much. I wish all of you the very best.
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato! I, I had hoped to have you always at my side...to guide me and support me.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Please...come back soon. As far as I'm concerned...you really are the very best judicial assistant in the world!
Susato:
...! ......... I'm...I'm quite sure... I'll be back before you know it!
Iris:
Really, Susie?
Susato:
Oh, now don't forget, Iris, I made you a promise I've yet to fulfil.
Iris:
A promise...?
Susato:
About your manuscript.
Iris:
Ah...
Ryunosuke:
(Oh yes... 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'...)
Iris:
......... Well I'll be waiting for you then, Susie! A promise is a promise!
Susato:
Definitely, Iris! ......... Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Yes?
Susato:
Do you remember the first time we met?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course. On the SS Burya, when I was dragged out from that wardrobe, still half asleep. If I remember rightly, you threw me halfway across the cabin with a Susato Takedown.
Susato:
You know very well that I'm talking about after that! It's strange, but being thrown together as we were in that case, I somehow felt straight away... ...that you were the perfect person to continue Kazuma-sama's great legacy.
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato...
Susato:
And my instincts were right! I really want to believe... No... I'm sure that... ...I'll be back soon. Farewell until then!
Anime cutscene
Ryunosuke:
Somehow we seem to have come to the end of the Adventures of Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Or the first volume, at least. Looking back now, it feels as though fate has led me on this journey. Fate led me to becoming a lawyer. To travelling halfway around the world. To meeting the great detective. I'm sure there'll be trials and tribulations ahead. Of course there will. But whatever happens I know I'll be able to turn my fortunes around. After all, I have the greatest friends in the world on my side.
Sholmes:
Ah, yes. Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
I have some rather...awkward news. The railway company has decided to sue over the special express train, apparently.
Ryunosuke:
Huh?
Iris:
It caused such a commotion on the line. All the other trains had to wait at stations.
Sholmes:
But really, we would never have made it to Dover in time otherwise. Anyway, I explained everything, and how it was all your fault.
Ryunosuke:
Huh? Huh?
Sholmes:
I believe a formal complaint should be delivered to your office tomorrow. But not to worry, my dear fellow. According to Miss Susato...
Iris:
...You love defending yourself in court!
Ryunosuke:
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Iris:
It's alright, I'm perfectly happy to testify! 'He really didn't look like the sort of man who'd do something so outrageous.' ...See?
Ryunosuke:
......... Um...Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
Yes?
Ryunosuke:
A word, if you don't mind...
Sholmes:
Why certainly! Any word you like. Bellow it out, my dear fellow!
Iris:
Oh yes! I love Runo's 'words'. And I know just the one he'll use here!
Ryunosuke:
Then I really must say...
Objection!
Sholmes:
In the following weeks, hundreds of music boxes arrived at Baker Street from all over Europe. Something was afoot! ...Though it transpired I had ordered them all myself. So I advertised them for sale with: 'Used by Mr Sholmes to solve an important case!' And the money I've earnt! Consulting detective work pays a pittance by comparison!
Iris:
Aaah...I haven't slept a wink. This manuscript is due tomorrow now! When I'm this busy, Hurley usually cooks me breakfast. Well, 'cooks' is an overstatement...for some dry toast and insipid coffee. I do miss Susie and her lovely Japanese breakfasts!
Auchi:
Witness! Your testimony is riddled with contradictions!
Korekuta:
Exactly! Rarely do rare koban coins hide under rare steaks themselves!
Nosa:
Well Aido Nosa knows his father is an innocent man! ...Or are you calling my son a liar?!
Judge:
Witnesses! My courtroom is no place for your petty arguments!
Hosonaga:
Having delivered the Russian dancer to shore in Shanghai, I laid low on the steamship for a while. But last night I apprehended an extremely suspicious Japanese national on board.
Soseki:
I've done NOTHING WRONG! All I did was give Wagahai's offspring refuge in my pocket! A man brings some kittens on board, and suddenly he's a hardened criminal! IT'S NOT FAIR!
Stronghart:
Scientific investigation will be the gold standard for policing in the new age. I dream of a world governed by the tenets of order and discipline. Like a great clock, in fact, whose hundreds of parts mesh together in perfect unison. Now...if you'll excuse me. I have but two minutes and thirty-seven seconds until my next appointment.
Gregson:
The latest Randst Magazine is out. And I'm in it again! Whenever I say that one line she wrote now, I get a standin' ovation! Wanna hear it? 'Hmph. Not bad, I suppose...for an amateur.' *Glug glug glug* Haah...Her Ladyship puts me to shame.
Garrideb:
Been visiting the old girl on a daily basis, of course. Joanie, my old jailbird! Must say, battling with those bally stairs every day has done wonders for the dicky peg. Managing rather well with the housework, too. Got this maid business taped up, I'd say. Hope the gossiping neighbours don't realise the man of the house is his own maid!
Patricia:
My Roly is back on the beat again! All thanks to the Reaper!
Roly:
There's nothing I enjoy more these days than hunting out small change in the gutter. I'm a better bobby now. Looking out for Londoners, their dropped ha'pennies and my lovely wife!
Oh, Pat...
Oh, Roly...
Gina:
Looks like I'm gonna be doin' time for a bit now. But Iris comes every day for a natter, so it ain't too borin'. She's always goin' on about all them cases wot Sholmes is lookin' into. Crim'nal investigations are kind of int'restin' when ya get into 'em.
Graydon:
Yes, I renounced my upbringing and chose a life of sophisticated crime. But regrets? ...Please.
Nash:
Give over, bruv! That ain't the Ash we used to know!
Ringo:
We got time in 'ere to plan the comeback of Milverton &amp; Skulkin's Milk Run, right?
The Three Muske-wotsits, milkin' the neighbourhood for all it's werf!
Susato:
...This past six months has been a time I shall remember for evermore. Painful goodbyes...and wonderful encounters... I've come to realise that's what life is all about. Naruhodo-san, I promise... Your assistant will return to you one day. But for now, I leave you with many memories, and a heartfelt wish...that life will treat you well.

FIN
Examine insignificant area on evidence
Ryunosuke:
I can't find anything out of place.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
The witness's last statement is clearly at odds with this piece of evidence!
Judge:
I'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see the connection.
Ryunosuke:
Oh!
Judge:
And for heaven's sake, would you kindly desist from that wide-eyed panic-stricken look you are wont to wear!
Ryunosuke:
(...But it's the only panic-stricken look I know...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Let's just consider the implications of that statement for a moment, shall we?
Judge:
What implications, Counsel? Nothing strikes me about it.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...um...exactly! There's nothing striking about it!
Judge:
Hm, what does strike me is your propensity for the inane, however.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... I need to clear my head and come at this again from a different angle.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
That reveals a damning inconsistency, that last statement!
Judge:
Damning, you say? As I look at you, Counsel, I see your trembling hand, your pallid expression and your perspiring brow.
Ryunosuke:
Huh?
Judge:
It seems to me THAT is the damning inconsistency here. With the misplaced confidence of your assertion!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... He has a damning tongue...)
Judge:
...You invite it, sir.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
There's clearly something odd about that last statement made by the witness!
Judge:
There is clearly something odd here indeed. Your behaviour, Counsel!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Haha! Please, d-don't mind me...
Judge:
That would be significantly easier if you would lower your hand.
Ryunosuke:
(I won't lower my hand until I prove my client's innocence! ...As long as it's quite quick.)
Pursue Nash Skulkin incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Nash Skulkin! Do you have something to add?
Nash:
Eh? Wot?
Ryunosuke:
Something that was said just now appears to have got you thinking.
Nash:
Oh, well, yeah... I woz just thinkin' about me bruv, Sulky.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...the one you've lost touch with?
Nash:
Yeah. Gor, 'e could be a right nasty piece o' work sometimes, that one! Always used to nab me share o' the grub when we 'ad anyfin' to eat.
Ryunosuke:
...He does sound like a very mean man.
Gregson:
Oi! What are you lookin' at me for, sunshine?!
Pursue Ringo Skulkin incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Ringo Skulkin! Do you have something to add?
Ringo:
Eh? Wot?
Ryunosuke:
Something that was said just now appears to have got you thinking.
Ringo:
Oh, well, yeah... I woz just thinkin' about me bruv, Sulky.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...the one you've lost touch with?
Ringo:
Yeah. Blimey, 'e could be a saint sometimes, that one! Always used to gimme a share of 'is grub when we 'ad anyfin' to eat.
Ryunosuke:
...He does sound like a very kind man.
Gregson:
Get out of it! These chips are mine! I'm not sharin'!
Pursue Tobias Gregson incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Is something wrong, Inspector?
Gregson:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Inspector Gregson!
Gregson:
I can't be here! I haven't got the time to stand around in the bloomin' stand!
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Gregson:
I need to get back to the Yard! Who knows what's kickin' off while I'm swannin' around here?
Ryunosuke:
...Are you referring to the emergency you've been talking about since yesterday?
Gregson:
I haven't been talkin' about anythin' of the sort! That's a top-secret assignment, that is!
Ryunosuke:
...Says the detective...at full volume...in the courtroom... with the public gallery.
Gregson:
......... Well...well... Well anyway! The point is, you need to get this trial over and done with as quickly as possible!
Pursue Juror No. 1 incorrectly during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Garrideb!
Juror No. 1:
Have to address me as 'juror number one' here, old chap. Or if you prefer, Garrideb Squadron Leader.
Ryunosuke:
...Right. Well...juror number one...did something just cross your mind?
Juror No. 1:
......... Well, if I must say... ...I was rather recoiling under your fearsome gaze.
Ryunosuke:
(...This squadron leader is a tough customer.)
Pursue Juror No. 2 incorrectly during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Juror number two! Would you care to add anything?
Juror No. 2:
Oh! Whatever do you mean, sir?
Ryunosuke:
That last statement is playing on your mind, is it not?
Juror No. 2:
The only thing that's playing on my mind at the moment... ...is this dull spot on the bench that I just can't seem to polish out.
Ryunosuke:
...Perhaps you'd be better off polishing up your listening skills rather than the bench.
Pursue Juror No. 3 incorrectly during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Juror number three!
Juror No. 3:
Gosh! What?
Ryunosuke:
Did something about that last statement make you see things in a different light somehow?
Juror No. 3:
An interesting question... And having considered it two-dimensionally, the answer would be...no.
Ryunosuke:
And what if you consider it three-dimensionally?
Juror No. 3:
......... I'm glad you asked! Having considered it three-dimensionally, the answer is...still no.
Ryunosuke:
(Any excuse to go cross-eyed...)
Pursue Juror No. 4 incorrectly during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Is everything alright, juror number four?
Juror No. 4:
Everything alright? Everything alright?! How could it possibly be, the way I'm feeling?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, is...something troubling you?
Juror No. 4:
Of course something's troubling me! Anyone could tell that just by looking at me. Don't tell me you haven't noticed me worrying! I've been making it as obvious as I possibly can.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Juror No. 4:
I mean, it's nothing to do with the trial, of course. It's a personal matter.
Ryunosuke:
...Don't tell me you haven't noticed...that everyone else in this courtroom is focused on the trial.
Pursue Juror No. 5 incorrectly during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Juror five! ...Is something wrong?
Juror No. 5:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Is there something about that last statement that's troubling you?
Juror No. 5:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Juror number five! I'm directing these questions at you!
Juror No. 5:
And I've been tapping my answer to you repeatedly! 'No. Stop.'
Ryunosuke:
(All that tapping just for that? Surely she's omitting some information there...) If I could ask you to stick to answering questions in a way that everyone present can understand?
Juror No. 5:
If you're feeling left out, sir, you could always switch to Japanese? Then no one would understand you, either.
Ryunosuke:
(...Because that would really help win the case.)
Pursue Juror No. 6 incorrectly during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Juror number six!
Juror No. 6:
Yes, comrade, what do you want?
Ryunosuke:
(Comrade? That sounds ominous...) I, um...was just wondering if that last statement had made you realise something, that's all.
Juror No. 6:
Da. There is one thing...
Ryunosuke:
Yes? Go on...
Juror No. 6:
English language is wery difficult. You must study wery hard.
Ryunosuke:
......... (I think it every time I speak with this man... Who on earth was responsible for selecting these jurors?!)
Pit incorrect juror statements during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Those two statements clearly contradict each other!
???:
Hold it!
Juror No. 1:
Sorry, old bean. Can't accept that, as squadron leader.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Juror No. 1:
All fighting for a common cause, don't you know, my chaps. No way they'd contradict one another.
Judge:
I concur, Mr Foreman. You will refrain from personal attacks on the jury based solely on your own frustrations, Counsel!
Ryunosuke:
(...The really frustrating thing is, I thought I'd identified a genuine discrepancy there...)
Iris:
There are a lot of questionable characters in the Garrideb Squadron. You might have to listen to what they have to say a few times before it starts to make sense.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, and press them on anything that sounds suspicious. That's the way forward here. (But still, should we really be labelling members of the jury as questionable?)
Pursue Ashley Graydon incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Are you alright there, Mr Graydon?
Graydon:
Quite alright, thank you. ...I didn't know you cared.
Ryunosuke:
Did something about that last piece of testimony strike a chord with you, perhaps?
Graydon:
No, not really. I tend to take no notice of what others say.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Graydon:
All I'm interested in is living my life...with a flourish.
Ryunosuke:
...If you'd kindly try not to 'flourish' into the people next to you, though...
Too many penalties
Judge:
Thank you, Counsels! ...I've seen enough. According to the powers vested in me by Her Majesty the Queen, I declare no further examination necessary. As such, I shall be requesting the final decisions of the members of the jury. Are you all ready, Mr Foreman?
Juror No. 1:
Abso-bally-lutely, my good sir!
Judge:
Then please announce your findings to the court!
Juror No. 1:
Guilty!
Juror No. 2:
Guilty!
Juror No. 3:
Guilty!
Juror No. 4:
Guilty!
Juror No. 5:
Guilty!
Juror No. 6:
Guilty!
Judge:
I hereby declare the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade...
Guilty
Judge:
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I applaud your considered and expedient deliberations. Court is adjourned!
