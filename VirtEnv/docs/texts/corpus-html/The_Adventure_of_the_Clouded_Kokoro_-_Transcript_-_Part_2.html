The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber</span></center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, I never expected this. Who'd have thought we'd be back here again so soon?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We are on a study tour of Great Britain...with the intention of learning the country's legal practices. In order to research the latest court procedures here, we need as much court experience as possible.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, yes, I suppose that's true, but... ...for the person in the dock, it may well be his or her one and only time in court. And it could be life-changing. In which case, treating it  as 'research' may seem a little... crass.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Oh, when you put it like that... You're quite right.
</p>
<center>Good morning!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, Mr Natsume. Good morning.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear, are you alright? Your eyes are terribly bloodshot.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
'The early bird catches the worm,' as they say here in Britain.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I've heard that expression.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
But I really don't want to catch a worm. SO I TRIED DESPERATELY NOT TO WAKE UP EARLY! BUT I WAS SO WORRIED, I COULDN'T <span style="color:#E16935">CATCH A WINK</span>! ...And now I'm absolutely exhausted as a result.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Do all literary people take things so...literally?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Thank you for putting your faith in us today, Mr Natsume.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
......... I, I WISH I HAD NINE LIVES! MY WHOLE FUTURE HANGS IN THE BALANCE! I'M...
</p>
<center>Too Terrified To Tremble!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Really? Because I can feel tremors in the floor.)</span>
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
I can't do this! I can't take it! Although...Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...yes?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
I caught a glimpse of the public gallery as I walked by the courtroom. It looked like the opening night of the opera, there were so many people. I had no idea my case was such a notorious affair here in London.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh. Um... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Neither did I.)</span> Do you know why that might be, Miss Susato?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm sorry, Mr Naruhodo, but I have no idea.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So that all-knowing look on your face is just coincidence then, is it?)</span>
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
DON'T HIDE THE TRUTH FROM ME! ...It's...it's... ...it's because of <span style="color:#E16935">the Reaper</span>, isn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Lord van Zieks?!)</span> Is, is that right, Miss Susato?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...I purchased as many different newspapers as I could find this morning, and yes... ...Lord van Zieks is on the front page of every one.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I knew it!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Sometime after the prosecutor was dubbed 'The Reaper of the Bailey'... ...he stopped appearing in court, it seems. It's been several years now, in fact, until the day before yesterday.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, Inspector Gregson told us something similar, didn't he?
</p>
<center>The trial two days ago marked Lord van Zieks's return to the courtroom after a very long hiatus. <span style="color:#0070C0">(The trial of Magnus McGilded... Ugh, what a harrowing experience that was.)</span></center>
<p><br />
Susato:<br />
I believe that appearance made even greater waves here in the capital than today's.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But we wouldn't have realised, of course, having only just arrived in the country.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
'Why is the Reaper back in the Bailey so soon, for what appears to be a mundane murder?' That's the question the papers are asking. And they are all speculating various answers.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
'Mundane'? MUNDANE?! It's the most significant saga of the century to some of us!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear! I meant no offence, Mr Natsume! But...that is how the papers are describing it.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Well, lest we also forget the fact that it could spark an international incident. Obviously, the reappearance of this infamous prosecutor has caught people's attention. But there's another blatant <span style="color:#E16935">similarity</span> with the trial of two days ago.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, I agree.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire... It's <span style="color:#E16935">you</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Me...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, I suppose that's true.)</span>
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Both times, it is you who stands against this legendary prosecutor. It, it can only mean...THAT YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH THE REAPER!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Please! I don't rub shoulders with...with...death-bringers!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm afraid that there's really only one other explanation. It can only be another example, Mr Naruhodo, of your uncommon <span style="color:#E16935">bad luck</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Thanks for that.)</span>
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Oh, this is just my luck! Why must I be represented by a man with such frail fortune? By the LEAST LUCKY LAWYER ALIVE!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Well, let's not forget... ...that it was you, Mr Natsume, who asked me to represent you.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, it's true that I'm just a student, new to London, with little in the way of experience or skills...or luck. But I promise you this... ...I will fight your corner until the bitter end. And I will believe in you, Mr Natsume.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Oh, benevolent Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You're not alone here with us, Mr Natsume. Whatever happens, we will always be on your side!
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Oh, benevolent Non-Locum Assistant Miss Mikotoba Esquiress... ......... I AM IN YOUR DEBT! FOREVER! I shall never forget this great kindness for as long as I live!
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Mr Natsume! Counsel for the Defence! The court session is about to begin. Kindly make your way into the courtroom at once!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright then, Mr Natsume, it's time. Let's go.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Y-Y-Ye... Y-Y-Ye... YEEESSSSSS!!!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center><span style="color:#0070C0">(This is it... My second appearance in a British courtroom. And my second trial against...the Reaper. I hope you're watching over me, Kazuma. Because this time, I won't let my faith waver. I'll believe in my client to the last. Just like you believed in me... ...I believe I can do this now! I'm ready for this fight!)</span></center>

The Old Bailey Courtroom</span></center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution is fully prepared, My Lord.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The defence...is ready, My Lord!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... The Nipponese are a truly fascinating breed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry, what?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Lord Stronghart has told me all about you. That you are a student who arrived in London but two days ago. A mere amateur.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Do, do you have a point?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Being a compatriot, you feel compelled to try to help the accused, I suppose. ...Typical Nipponese arrogance.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Forgive me, but I do not believe arrogance is an appropriate description.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Susato-san...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
After all, at our previous encounter, the defendant was found to be innocent.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Very true. And a most fascinating - if dark - trial it was, too. The tragic conclusion came later, of course. Here's to the acquitted, and his unfortunate <span style="color:#E16935">violent end</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Counsels. I see both sides are in fine fettle. Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...are you ready to carry out your duties here in court as impartial members of the public?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
You never know when you might be down on your luck. But I believe in fair play for everyone.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Well I must warn you, I'm rather more ruthless than I appear.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Oh well, not me. What you see is what you get. I'm a peace-loving fellow.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
I'm afraid to say, I think it's quite possible that moustached foreigner did the deed.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Come on, what are we waiting for? No doubt he did it, anyway.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Eh? Sorry? Didn't quite catch that.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, let us proceed. Your opening statement, if you please, Lord van Zieks.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Very recently, Great Britain signed an alliance with a rising power in the Far East. The accused in the dock today is a student from that same land. A certain Mr Soseki Natsume. And while our country has extended this foreign student the warmest of welcomes... ...regrettably the kindness has not been returned. In fact, this student is accused of a most sinister act. Of plunging a knife into the back of an innocent woman who was doing nothing but walking down the street!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
A knife crime?! I tell you from bitter experience, those are the worst! Bloody oath, they are!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Just look at that sallow complexion and short stature... He's, he's one of those dreadful 'Japanese'!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Come on, let's get this over with. With me now, everyone. One, two...three!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Eh? Sorry? Didn't quite catch that.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Pray...forgive the discourtesy of smashing my hallowed chalice here in this great chamber. Allow me to call the first witness to the stand.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. Bailiff, lead the inspector in, please!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
Your name and occupation, please.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes, sir. Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Would you please summarise the events of the case for the court, Inspector?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
The victim is thought to be a young woman in her twenties by the name of Olive Green.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I beg your pardon, Inspector? '<span style="color:#E16935">Thought to be</span>'?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes, havin' been stabbed in the back by her attacker's knife, the victim fell unconscious. That was three days ago now. And she's been <span style="color:#E16935">comatose ever since</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(So they don't even know who she is for sure?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm, comatose... I see. But her life is not in danger?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Fortunately for the Eastern student, the charge will not be murder. Pray, elaborate on the details, Inspector.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Sir. If I could ask everyone to look at this street map... As I mentioned, the incident took place three days ago. ...At around five in the afternoon. It happened <span style="color:#E16935">on the pavement</span> running alongside Briar Road, a wide thoroughfare for horse-drawn vehicles. It had not long since stopped snowin' as the victim - Miss Green - was walkin' down the street. Out of the blue, she was approached from behind by the accused and stabbed in the back. Luckily, the young lady's life was spared, and she's currently bein' treated in one of the city's hospitals. But bein' unconscious as she is, we've been unable to take a statement from her, of course. This is the case file with everything we know about the victim so far.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Inspector. The court will accept the documents as evidence, if you please.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The case file has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What of <span style="color:#E16935">the weapon</span> that was used?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Sir. I have that here. It was removed from the victim's back.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ouch. That big thing is starting to make me scared to walk down the street now...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
With a heavy blade like that, almost anybody would have been able to stab the poor woman.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Even the scragged-looking Soseki-san, I suppose...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... A common-or-garden jackknife, I would say. Rather nondescript. Thank you, Inspector. The court accepts the blade as evidence.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The jackknife has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now then...what do we know of the motive? <span style="color:#E16935">Money or valuables</span>, I presume?

<p>Gregson:<br />
From what we can tell by looking at the woman's possessions, it seems like she's a poor student herself. Hard to imagine she would have had anythin' much worth pinchin', My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I see. Well, in that case, are we looking at some deep-seated <span style="color:#E16935">resentment</span> toward the victim?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
...I'm afraid I couldn't say. Apart from visitin' secondhand bookshops, the defendant, Mr Natsume, doesn't appear to get out much. At this moment in time, we haven't been able to establish any sort of connection between him and the victim.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Scotland Yard does not arrest people without good cause. That should be beyond question. Inspector Gregson, the prosecution calls for your formal testimony. Explain to the court precisely why the constabulary came to arrest the Nipponese student.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes, sir!

<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span><br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- Mr Natsume's Arrest -</span></center>
<p>Gregson:<br />
As I said, it was five o'clock in the afternoon when the incident occurred. And there was an unusually light fog.<br />
Visibility was reasonably good, and there was no one else about but the victim and the accused.<br />
Out of the blue, the victim was stabbed from behind and subsequently collapsed on the pavement.<br />
The accused ran off, scatterin' his belongings all over the floor.<br />
Those bein' a number of old books he'd just bought. He was on his way home from a bookshop, it seems.<br />
It was just a matter of workin' out who the books belonged to, and we found the bloke to arrest him.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Old books, you say?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes, My Lord. I have a photograph here of the scene of the crime, taken immediately after the incident.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah yes, I can clearly see <span style="color:#E16935">the books</span> to which you are referring. I will take that photographic print as evidence, please, Inspector.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The crime scene photograph has been entered into the Court Record.</span>

You Nipponese are a spineless breed. Too cowardly to admit defeat. Denying everything despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...I...

Forgive me, Lord van Zieks, but the defendant is not denying '<span style="color:#E16935">everything</span>', as you put it.

What are you doing, Miss Susato?

Do go on...

Mr Natsume has admitted to playing some part in the incident. Isn't that right, Mr Naruhodo?

As I was walking along that accursed pavement, I could make out the sole silhouette of another ahead of me. A woman, wearing a green overcoat, she was. And just as I went to overtake her... ...she suddenly let out a little scream, and collapsed onto the cold, hard slabs of stone at my feet! I was terrified! I had to get away from there! So I ran! As fast as my legs would carry me back to my accursed lodgings!

<p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Hmph, a green overcoat?

Well that's exactly what the woman in that print is wearing!

Oh my! A photographic print in full colour! What will the world come up with next?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The defendant has done nothing more than admit he fled the scene of a terrifying incident! That does NOT mean that he's guilty of the heinous crime of stabbing the woman in the back!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
There was nobody else there at the time. Just <span style="color:#E16935">the two of them</span>: the victim...and the accused. In other words, there is <span style="color:#E16935">nobody else</span> who could possibly have stabbed the woman. A fact...that the accused concedes!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A light fog, you say?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Well, light for London. You could see the opposite side of the street for once. Not much farther, though.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That's light, is it?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Around these parts, yes. Not something I'd expect a Japanese fellow like yourself to know, of course.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I've read that London is famous for its fog. But in my country, people usually imagine that gives the city a rather beautiful appearance.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Tsk. How quaint.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes, well, it's not somethin' us Londoners tend to romanticise, as I expect you can appreciate.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I see...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
At this time of year, the fog causes a large number of accidents, especially when it's heavy. Sometimes you can't even see your own hand at the end of your arm.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed. The other day, I was very nearly trampled by horses before I could see the carriage they were pulling.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh... Susato-san and I should definitely remember to stop, look and listen...)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
However, on the day that concerns us, the fog was somewhat lighter than usual. A fact no doubt lamented by the accused.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How are you able to state that with any certainly?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Quite simply, my learned friend. Because that is what <span style="color:#E16935">the witnesses</span> to this crime have told us.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ah yes, Inspector Gregson mentioned the witnesses yesterday, didn't he?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's right. One of them is <span style="color:#E16935">a policeman</span>, I believe. From Scotland Yard.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That is correct, ma'am.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then we must hear their testimony!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution will of course call them to the stand... should it be necessary.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, wait a minute! At five o'clock in the afternoon in the middle of winter... it would have been dark already! No matter how light the fog might have been, no one could have seen-
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I'm unaware of the situation on your tiny island in the East... ...but here in the capital city of Great Britain...all main roads are illuminated in the night by gas streetlights.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution believes there would have been ample light by which to witness the crime.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Quite. Here in London, for the first time in history, mankind has completely conquered the darkness.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Which means we really need to hear those witness statements. If I could just get through the fog of this cross-examination, maybe we'll be able to...)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It seems the counsel for the defence is...taking stock. Continue with your testimony, Inspector.

</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That's right. As you can see from this print.

...Yes, quite so, Inspector. The handle of the weapon is clearly protruding from the victim's back. And you say this poor woman - Miss Green - remains in a critical condition? Comatose, no less?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I'm afraid so, My Lord, yes. She's bein' treated at Barts. I was hopeful that she'd come round before the trial started so I could take a statement, but it wasn't to be.

That's right, My Lord. Secondhand books, they were. Irreparably damaged after fallin' in the snow, of course.

The defendant apparently visits a secondhand bookshop on a daily basis.

Yes, so I understand. A shop full of old English literature.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I commend the accused on the lofty subject matter of his scholarly attention.

The bloke's room was stacked floor to ceilin' with those musty old books.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Can you tell us more about the bookshop in question, please, Inspector?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Well, if I must. I'll have to ask you to look at the street map again, I'm afraid. The closest secondhand bookshop to the accused's lodgings is this place here. Bourbon Books. A little place on the corner of Briar Road and Meerschaum Street. As it happens, the accused is currently livin' in lodgings on the other side of Briar Road at the opposite end. Which means it doesn't take a genius to work out the route he would've taken home. Somethin' like this.

Hm, so the shop is called Bourbon Books, is it?

That's right. That's the closest secondhand bookshop to the accused's lodgings. And to get from there back to his room... ...he would have gone right past the very spot where the incident took place.

You haven't confirmed it? Why the devil not, Inspector?

Well, um, the thing is... ...the shopkeeper's gone on a trip, you see. Left the mornin' after the incident. To collect more stock, I'm told. So we, um, haven't been able to ask the bloke if the accused visited his shop on the day in question or not.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well in that case, what did the defendant himself have to say about it?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...No recollection.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!

According to the statement he made at the time, the accused has no recollection of where he'd been.

The bloke clearly has his head in the clouds whenever he's walkin' about town. He claims he just wanders into whatever bookshop he happens to be passin', and rarely notices the name.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You asked for the help of the famous detective, Herlock Sholmes, to locate the defendant, I believe.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... Stuff and nonsense.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That Jack-in-office...that busybody...just comes and sticks his oar in whether we ask him or not!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but according to what I have here... ...Mr Sholmes was shown to the scene by Scotland Yard detectives.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Well that was nothin' to do with me! The lads at the scene must've done it! Without my permission!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I tell 'em time and again! Whenever somethin' happens, send word to headquarters! Then follow your bloomin' instructions!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I see.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
If that meddler gets his hands on any details, we'll all be readin' it in Randst Magazine next month! And you can bet your last farthin' that I'll be in there, too, stripped of all my hard work on the case! 'Yes, Mr Sholmes, no, Mr Sholmes', 'Aren't you clever, Mr Sholmes'! That's all the thanks I'll be gettin'!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Inspector. If the man is proving detrimental to the Yard's activities... ...perhaps I should step in and...<span style="color:#E16935">deal with him</span>?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Argh!!! .........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It appears Inspector Gregson is lost for words.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. The Reaper's words carry a lot of weight, obviously.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Anyway, the point is this! That little Japanese bloke's already admitted it. He's admitted that those books all over the pavement at the scene were the ones he bought that day!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm...
</p>

<p>Susato:<br />
What do you think, Mr Naruhodo? If you're unable to sway the jury during this cross-examination, I'm afraid-
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That Mr Natsume's fate will be sealed? Yes, they're sure to find him guilty. So one way or another... ...I have to expose an undeniable <span style="color:#E16935">inconsistency</span> in the inspector's testimony!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...if, if I could just stop you there, Inspector Gregson...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
What is it, sunshine? I'm a busy man, you know!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This is a receipt that we found in Mr Natsume's room. It was issued on the day of the incident, and details the purchase of three secondhand books.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
And you found that in the accused's room, did you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, but the point is not where the receipt was found, but <span style="color:#E16935">the name of the shop</span> printed on it.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Go on.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This receipt was issued from a bookshop called...<span style="color:#E16935">Yore Books</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yore Books? Y-o-r-e, I presume...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord. So Mr Natsume did indeed purchase a number of books at a secondhand bookshop that day. However! The bookshop in question...was not Bourbon Books!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Eh? What?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Inspector! Do you know of this other bookshop?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Y-Yes sir! Yore Books is another secondhand bookshop not far from Bourbon Books. It's just that... Well, it's such a small place, I, I didn't think the accused would have known about it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But in fact that IS the bookshop which the defendant visited on the day in question. And this receipt proves it!

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Yes...for what difference it makes. Wherever the man purchased his musty tomes, it makes no difference in <span style="color:#E16935">the final analysis</span>.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I disagree! I, I mean...after all, um...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I have the street map here, if that might be of help?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, um... Yes! Thank you! Have a look at this, please... If the defendant had been returning from Bourbon Books... ...then yes, he would almost certainly have passed the place where Miss Green was attacked. However! If we take into account the fact that he was actually at another bookshop - Yore Books... ...it may very well turn out that <span style="color:#E16935">he wouldn't have passed that location</span> at all!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...! Could that be true?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
My my, it rather depends on where this other bookshop is, but I do declare it may be a possibility...
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Is that right, Mr Lawyer, sir? What you just said?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Absolutely! It absolutely could be right!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Inspector Gregson! Where is this Yore Books establishment?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Well, um, obviously we looked into that. It turns out that Yore Books... ...is just here on the next corner of Meerschaum Street goin' east.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The local map's information has been updated in the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And there you have it! As you can clearly see now... ......... ...Oh.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...My learned Nipponese friend is obviously in training to be a clown, the way he regales us with such witticisms. To your future career in the circus.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Grrr...you put that glass down now, or I'll put it down for you!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I, erm...didn't think I needed to spell it out, but here we go. If the accused was comin' home from Yore Books instead of Bourbon Books... ...there's no doubt he still would have passed the place where the victim was stabbed.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, thank you, Inspector.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Allow me to reiterate for my learned, if somewhat slow, Nipponese friend... Wherever the man purchased his musty tomes, it makes no difference in <span style="color:#E16935">the final analysis</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
AAAAAAGH!!!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
As I suspected! You can't fool me! And I don't suggest you try!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
What did I say, eh? I've had enough of this now!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Beg your pardon? Terribly sorry, but would you mind repeating that?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo! We mustn't give up!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What, what do you mean?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
If the prosecution's assertion is correct... ...the members of the jury may very well decide that Mr Natsume is guilty!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! <span style="color:#0070C0">(She's absolutely right!)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We must think! We must consider the assertion just put forward by the prosecution very, very carefully!

Erm, yes, My Lord! You, you can see what I mean on this map! When returning from Yore Books to his lodgings... ...Mr Natsume could have followed the route suggested by the prosecution. However... ...that isn't the only conceivable route to take between the two places. If the defendant used these streets...look what happens! He arrives back at his lodgings without passing the location where the victim was attacked!

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Talking back to a clown is a fool's errand, of course. However, I feel compelled to point out that... ...that route is what is commonly referred to as <span style="color:#E16935">the long way round</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
On a cold winter's night, why would any man choose to take a longer route home?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, um...erm...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The answer is extremely simple: He wouldn't. In other words... ...the accused took the obvious route back to his lodgings, and is the obvious perpetrator of this crime!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...but...BUT! Ah-ha, yes! I've got it! Obviously, we must ask the man himself! Ask Mr Natsume which route he took home!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I have already informed the court of the accused's response to such questioning. He claims he has 'no recollection'.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Haah...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That's right. As I said, the bloke seems to spend his time outside wanderin' aimlessly from A to B. That day was no exception. He says he doesn't remember where he was or which route he took home.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I don't... I DON'T BELIEVE THIIIS!!!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...I thank you, my learned friend. And suggest that we do not waste any more of the court's time by wandering aimlessly around this subject. Pray, what say you insightful jurors?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but even if that is the case, the defence still-

</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, Counsel... ...in accordance with the letter of the law, we shall proceed with a summation examination. Are the members of the jury ready, Mr Foreman?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Of course we're ready! I'm all too familiar with that Nipponese whippersnapper and his onkus refusal to throw in his alley.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well then. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain <span style="color:#E16935">on what grounds</span> you have determined the defendant to be guilty!

<p>Juror No. 1:<br />

</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
If he said that a woman in green collapsed before his eyes, why it can only have been the victim!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
The man wouldn't have gone around the houses on his way back from the bookshop. Not in winter!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
So the poor woman was attacked from behind, was she? How dreadful!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
I really don't care! Can't we just wrap this up now? I've got work to be doing!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Hm, Yore Books, yes... Nice shop, that. But Bourbon Books? ...Hmph, no, not worth a visit.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... With only minor exceptions, the reasons for finding the defendant guilty are all too clear.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
When the stabbing occurred, the only two people at the scene were the victim and the accused. And the accused himself... ...has admitted to seeing the victim in her green overcoat sink to the ground before his eyes.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Furthermore, we have heard from the inspector that the defendant then fled the scene. I must say, I would have ample grounds to convict this man already.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear, even the judge appears convinced of Mr Natsume's guilt now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh, why did he have to run away like that? And how are we supposed to believe in some phantom attacker that nobody could see? This is impossible! How can I possibly make a case for the defence?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo! This is no time for grumbling! If we want to force the trial to continue-
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I know. I have to <span style="color:#E16935">turn the tide</span>. I must make the jurors change their minds. Well, four of them, at least.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Exactly. We have no choice but to forge forward!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You have the floor, Counsel. Begin your summation examination.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Yes, I had a feeling I knew your face. ...Or the side of it, anyway. If I remember correctly, you're a banker, aren't you?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
That's right. After the gold rush down under, I came back to London to work. And it was all going swimmingly until you started fossicking around! <span style="color:#E16935">Bruce Fairplay</span> was a man of repute!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Don't think I've forgotten how you treated me the other day! You had me and that young hatter <span style="color:#E16935">pegged as criminals</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, well, you know... Water under the bridge!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Now there's all sorts of rumours buzzing around. And the police have been badgering me nonstop.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...If, if I could turn back the clock...
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Well anyway, I don't know about the hatter, but at least I'm in the clear now. And free to make up my own mind about who's guilty and who isn't.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Haah... Thank goodness... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright, maaaybe I might struggle to change this man's mind, given our awkward history...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear, I wonder what's become of Mr Furst now...

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You're right that at the time of the incident... ...the defendant <span style="color:#E16935">admits to having seen</span> someone wearing a green overcoat walking ahead of him.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Well quite! That's precisely my point. Clearly that 'someone wearing green' was the victim. And clearly that funny little Nipponese man with the disturbing moustache is <span style="color:#E16935">the culprit</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But let us not forget, madam! The defendant vehemently denies attacking the woman!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Why, of course he does! If he admits to stabbing her, his life is over. The man is obviously a liver-faced coward. Honestly! Claiming the woman simply collapsed before his eyes!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But if that's a lie as you're suggesting, do you not think he would have concocted something more credible?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Oh, I really couldn't say. After all, you are...foreign. Who's to say what goes through your funny little minds.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I could tell you what's going through my funny little mind right now, but you wouldn't like it...)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
I do declare the man has already made the admission. He himself has stated that there was nobody else around. Surely the conclusion is obvious? No one else could possibly have committed this awful crime!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
If no one else could have done it, the accused must be the man. Really, it couldn't be more simple!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Your argument is compelling in its simplicity, I must admit.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Oh my! You are too kind, My Lord!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Those two statements clearly show a flaw in the jurors' reasoning!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A flaw? What are you talking about, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I think perhaps the old man didn't hear you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Unbelievable. It's not like I was loud or anything... There is at least one fact of which we can be sure here. The bookshop receipt found in the defendant's room clearly indicates that on the day of the attack... ...he had been to Yore Books and purchased a number of secondhand titles. He then returned home on foot.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
But the man says he has no recollection of his return journey.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's correct. But what he does remember is seeing someone appear in front of him on the way. Someone in a green overcoat, who suddenly collapsed on the pavement before his eyes.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Yes, we are well aware of all this! The poor young woman who was stabbed, obviously.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Can we really be sure of that, madam?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
My! Whatever do you mean?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm sure you heard juror number six's account of what happened to him that day? That same afternoon, there was somebody else apart from the victim... ...who was <span style="color:#E16935">wearing a green overcoat</span> and who <span style="color:#E16935">fell over</span> on the icy streets in the neighbourhood.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Oh my!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
My goodness, you, you mean...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right. I'm referring of course... ...to hard-of-hearing juror number six!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Are, are you really suggesting... ...that the person in the green overcoat whom the defendant saw collapse in front of his eyes... ...was the jolly old gentleman on the end of the bench here with me today?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That is entirely possible, yes. After all, the old man... ...has a somewhat similar build to the victim.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Well look at that!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
My goodness me!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Hm? Sorry? You need a pee?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And crucially! We know <span style="color:#E16935">precisely where</span> the old man in the green overcoat fell!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
On Calabash Road...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Therefore, if the person who Mr Natsume saw collapsing in front of him was in fact juror number six... ...it means the defendant must have taken the long route back to his lodgings. And if that's true, then clearly... ...the crime scene on Briar Road where the woman was stabbed...was not on his way home!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Oooh my!

You idiot, old man! If you hadn't been so daft as to be roaming about there, we'd have boxed this off hours ago!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
And really! What were you thinking, wearing such a befuddling coat?!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
What did you say to me?! Is it a crime for the elderly to walk the streets these days, hm? Is it a crime to slip over on the ice? Is it a crime to keep up with the latest styles and wear a beautiful, green overcoat, is it?!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?

Is it a crime to change your mind, is it? Well?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! That was wonderful!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, we've managed to change a couple of minds at least. It's strengthened our position somewhat.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes! And it will prompt the other members of the jury to reconsider their stance as well. They'll be asking themselves if their current leanings are really right or not. Now, if only... If we could just identify one more clue or discrepancy that would make them stop doubting Mr Natsume... ...we might be able to tip the balance completely!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, that's exactly what we've got to do! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Van Zieks is looking to bring this trial to an early conclusion. That's what we have to prevent, by whatever means we have at our disposal!)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But you can't deny that there are other routes Mr Natsume could have taken back from Yore Books.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Oh yes. Like you drew on the map, you mean? What was it? Calabash Road or something?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Precisely.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
But it seems to me that what counts is whether the little Japanese fellow <span style="color:#E16935">actually went that way or not</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...yes, that's true.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
And at the moment, there's <span style="color:#E16935">no proof</span> that shows he did, is there?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...yes, that's true as well.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
And as I understand it, the accused himself <span style="color:#E16935">doesn't remember</span> which way he went, does he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...yes, that's annoyingly true.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Winter nights are dark and cold, so the way I see it, you'd want to <span style="color:#E16935">get home</span> as quickly as possible.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...yes... Haah...why is all this true?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
So really, the only thing that makes sense is that he went home along Briar Road.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm supposed to be convincing you here!)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
I have given it a lot of thought, you know. I didn't just make up my mind on a whim that he did it. I mean, if there was some logical reason why he might have gone the Calabash Road way, it'd be different. I'd be happy to reconsider my position in that case. Honest, I would.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hm, a reason why Soseki-san might have taken the longer way home...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, a good reason... I don't imagine you'll be able to sway this young man's opinion without one.

Oh! Me, sir? What, what do you mean?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Juror number five's words just now are extremely significant. Let's take a moment to consider the implications of what's been said on our map of the local area. On the day in question, Mr Natsume visited this bookshop to purchase a number of secondhand books. And on the same day... ...we now know that there were works being carried out on Meerschaum Street, making it impassable. Which means that the defendant's route home... ...could not have taken him along Meerschaum Street and down Briar Road.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Oh! Yes! Of course! What, what do you think, sir?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Well! Yes, you can't argue with that really, can you? We must've had a good two yards or more of the pavement up. Every gentleman and gentlewoman that came along had to turn back and go the other way.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So the only conclusion is this! The defendant must have <span style="color:#E16935">taken the longer route</span> back to his lodgings!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Yes, I suppose he must have.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
I, I suppose that must be right, eh?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Juror number three, you said the following: 'The man wouldn't have gone around the houses on his way back from the bookshop.' ...But! We see now...that he had no choice!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Yeees! ......... My Lord Mr Judge, sir, if I may...?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
I, I don't think in all good conscience...that I can say the man's guilty now. ......... Yes, I'd like to see this trial continue so we can get to the bottom of what really happened. What about you, sir?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Eh? Who, me? Hm, well, alright then... If there's a hole in the prosecution's argument, it should be filled in, that's what I say.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! That was wonderful!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, we've managed to change a couple of minds at least. It's strengthened our position somewhat.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes! And it will prompt the other members of the jury to reconsider their stance as well. They'll be asking themselves if their current leanings are really right or not. Now, if only... If we could just identify one more clue or discrepancy that would make them stop doubting Mr Natsume... ...we might be able to tip the balance completely!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, that's exactly what we've got to do! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Van Zieks is looking to bring this trial to an early conclusion. That's what we have to prevent, by whatever means we have at our disposal!)</span>

</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Whatever is the matter, young man?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You're the wife of Mr Garrideb, aren't you? The landlord who rents Mr Natsume his room.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
The master's wife?! Where do you get your ideas, sir? I'm the maid! The maid, you understand!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She's keeping up that charade? ...Ugh, this is going to be awkward.)</span> Erm, why didn't you mention this yesterday? That you'd been selected for the jury in this trial, I mean.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Well, I was told not to mention it to anyone until the day of the trial, you see. It was in the letter I received. The instructions were very clear. So I'm afraid I had no choice.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I see. Anyway, Mr Natsume - the defendant - takes lodging in your...master's house, doesn't he?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Yes, that's right. Although he's only been in a little over a week now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And in that time, surely you must have taken stock of his character. Does Mr Natsume look like the kind of man who would commit a crime such as this?!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Oh my goodness me, yes! He's just the sort.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Spending all his time in that dark and dingy room, sporting that unscrupulous moustache... The man never speaks! And don't get me started on those shifty eyes! All the neighbours are talking about him. I've heard them, you know. People think he must be building a bomb in there or something.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear, poor Mr Natsume. How could people say such things about him? He's just a harmless bookworm, nothing more.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Well, you just called him a worm, so... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Anyway, I'd better be careful about inviting this 'maid' to speak. She's said enough damning things already.)</span>

A man's life is on the line here, sir! This will take as long as it takes!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Don't get clever with me now, son! My life's on the line, too. And so is my family's.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
The likes of you wouldn't understand, but a labourer like me can't afford to take time off. If I don't work, I don't eat! And neither do the wife and kids!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, I see. That...must be very hard.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
I go to the union every morning to find out what needs doing. If you're late and the work's taken, it's tough. This time of year, there's water and gas supply pipes bursting left, right and centre. They're after cheap labour to get the roads dug up to fix it. It's a hard slog from dawn till dusk, it is.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...you were out digging up the roads on the day of the incident as well, were you?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
That's right. In fact, if I remember rightly... ...it was just round the corner from where it all happened. By that old bookshop, it was.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Another coincidence?)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
That's right, <span style="color:#E16935">Meerschaum Street</span>, it was.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Meerschaum Street...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
On the map, Mr Naruhodo! There are only three named streets!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Juror number five! I need you to add that information to your formal statement, please.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
What's the point in that? Can't we just get this business over with now?

Please, sir, it's important!

Tsk, fine, I'll do it then.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So, if I understand correctly, you're a day labourer and you were doing road maintenance that day?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
That's right. Like I said, you get a lot of burst gas and water pipes underground in the middle of winter. It's the only time of year fellows like me can actually make a few bob. And I'm missing out today!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And...when you say from dawn till dusk...?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Well the work has to be completed within the day, see. No coaches or pedestrians can pass while it's happening.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I wonder if I could trouble you, sir... ...to mark on this street map the exact location of the works you were carrying out?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Give it here, then. Let me have a look. Right, let's see then... Here we are, Meerschaum Street. Yes, it was just here, like. It was a tidy dig, I can tell you. We had to get through all the drifts of snow that had frozen solid.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And at what sort of time did you finish the work?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Well, we started in the morning and we can't have finished before gone six, I'd say. The snow had stopped coming down, but it was long past dark for sure.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That means the road work was still going on when Miss Green was attacked at around five o'clock.

</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Hm? Sorry? 'Fold it,' you say? Fold what?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Um, no no, what I said was 'Hold it!' What I wanted to ask was, do you visit Yore Books often?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I like the old books they have in there, yes. I enjoy reading them over a nice cup of old tea. That's my daily routine, you see. Same thing every day. Including the day you're all talking about.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And at what time did you visit Yore Books on the day in question?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Well, I was picking out books in there all afternoon, and it would have been just before five that I left. That's my daily routine, you see. Same thing every day. Including the day you're all talking about.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Just before five, you say? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Exactly when the victim was attacked!)</span> Are you sure about the time?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Oh yes, no mistake there. I remember it well, I'm not about to forget that day in a hurry. Not after the dreadful time I had.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Well, I was walking down Calabash Road when I slipped on the ice and donked my head! It's always worse after the snow's stopped falling. That's when it's most slippery. Knocked myself clean out, I did. I really thought my number was up!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wait a minute! Let me get this straight. This happened...on <span style="color:#E16935">Calabash Road</span>?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
That's right. I live in Cornpipe, you see. Heading down Calabash Road is the quickest way for me to get back from Yore Books.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Juror number six! I must insist... ...that you add that information to your formal statement! It may very well be extremely significant!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Hm? Sorry? 'Extremely sick'? No no, I'm quite alright now.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And that was at around five o'clock, you say? The same time as the victim was attacked.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I don't know anything about the girl who was stabbed. But my dinner's on the table at the same time every day.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And for the record, could you please identify the precise location of your fall?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Goodness, it was aeons ago now. I'm not sure I can remember.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...It was three days ago. Try dredging your memory. Please.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Hm, well, let me see... It was especially slippery around about... Ah yes! I remember now! It was just on the corner here.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What happened to you then? Were you alright?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Well, you don't get too many people down Calabash Road, you see. So there was no one around when I fell... No one around when I knocked myself out... No one around when I came to again... And no one around when I sneezed. So I picked myself up and went back to my nice, warm house where my grandchildren were waiting for me.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A sad and lonely picture you paint, sir. You were fortunate not to have frozen to death.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, how lucky that he wasn't more seriously injured!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
True. It sounds like it was very nearly another hospital admission...or worse. Ah yes, one more thing... Were you wearing that same green overcoat on the day in question?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Absolutely. It's the only coat I have. It took until this morning to dry out properly. Good job too, or I'd have had nothing to wear here. So count your blessings, I say! Ho ho ho!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Those two statements clearly show a flaw in the jurors' reasoning!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A flaw? What are you talking about, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, juror number two? Juror number six?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
My, whatever do you mean, sir?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I think perhaps the old man didn't hear you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Unbelievable. It's not like I was loud or anything... There is at least one fact of which we can be sure here. The bookshop receipt found in the defendant's room clearly indicates that on the day of the attack... ...he had been to Yore Books and purchased a number of secondhand titles. He then returned home on foot.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
But the man says he has no recollection of his return journey.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's correct. But what he does remember is seeing someone appear in front of him on the way. Someone in a green overcoat, who suddenly collapsed on the pavement before his eyes.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Yes, we are well aware of all this! The poor young woman who was stabbed, obviously.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Can we really be sure of that, madam?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
My! Whatever do you mean?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm sure you heard juror number six's account of what happened to him that day? That same afternoon, there was somebody else apart from the victim... ...who was <span style="color:#E16935">wearing a green overcoat</span> and who <span style="color:#E16935">fell over</span> on the icy streets in the neighbourhood.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Oh my!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
My goodness, you, you mean...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right. I'm referring of course... ...to hard-of-hearing juror number six!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Are, are you really suggesting... ...that the person in the green overcoat whom the defendant saw collapse in front of his eyes... ...was the jolly old gentleman on the end of the bench here with me today?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That is entirely possible, yes. After all, the old man... ...has a somewhat similar build to the victim.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Well look at that!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
My goodness me!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Hm? Sorry? You need a pee?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And crucially! We know <span style="color:#E16935">precisely where</span> the old man in the green overcoat fell!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
On Calabash Road...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Therefore, if the person who Mr Natsume saw collapsing in front of him was in fact juror number six... ...it means the defendant must have taken the long route back to his lodgings. And if that's true, then clearly... ...the crime scene on Briar Road where the woman was stabbed...was not on his way home!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Oooh my!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
You idiot, old man! If you hadn't been so daft as to be roaming about there, we'd have boxed this off hours ago!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
And really! What were you thinking, wearing such a befuddling coat?!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
What did you say to me?! Is it a crime for the elderly to walk the streets these days, hm? Is it a crime to slip over on the ice? Is it a crime to keep up with the latest styles and wear a beautiful, green overcoat, is it?!

And I would too!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?

Is it a crime to change your mind, is it? Well?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! That was wonderful!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, we've managed to change a couple of minds at least. It's strengthened our position somewhat.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes! And it will prompt the other members of the jury to reconsider their stance as well. They'll be asking themselves if their current leanings are really right or not. Now, if only... If we could just identify one more clue or discrepancy that would make them stop doubting Mr Natsume... ...we might be able to tip the balance completely!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, that's exactly what we've got to do! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Van Zieks is looking to bring this trial to an early conclusion. That's what we have to prevent, by whatever means we have at our disposal!)</span>

It seems I must retract my earlier remark.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I mistakenly credited these jurors with intelligence by describing them as 'insightful'. Yet we have just witnessed them falling for a cheap trick performed by an Eastern 'entertainer'.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Eh?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Whatever do you mean?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I haven't tricked anyone! Everything I've said is the truth!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Indeed... Stalwart juror number five was undoubtedly repairing the road, as he claims. I believe you said it was 'a good two yards' of the pavement which you had excavated, sir?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
That's right. Took me the whole day and they paid me a measly tuppence for it!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Now, my learned Nipponese friend, tell me... ...do you have any notion of the distance that two yards represents?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! Um, well... <span style="color:#0070C0">(If I'm honest, I don't have a clue, no...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Two yards is...a little less than two metres.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Less than two metres? <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's...not much at all!)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
In other words, a distance readily vaulted by anyone of moderate vigour. ...Would you not agree, my stalwart friend?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Eh? Me? Well, I can't say you're wrong, no.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And did you perchance erect a sign to prevent pedestrians from passing the site of your works?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Eh? I wouldn't dream of it! What a waste of time! No coaches would have had a hope of passing anyway, and we just turn any gentlefolk back when they come. Kids just jump right over us all the time.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...The accused is no gentleman, as far as I can see. I have little doubt, however, that he could spring over a two-yard trench in his meanderings around town.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Is that true? Is it?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The incontrovertible truth is that the books just purchased by the accused were found at the scene. There can be no doubt that on his way back to his lodgings, Mr Natsume walked down Briar Road.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Crushed...in a single sentence...)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And...old man...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
C-Cold man?! ...You can talk!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You say that around five o'clock on the day in question, you slipped and fell on Calabash Road. Pray, was there a suspicious-looking Nipponese behind you at the time?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Oh! I, I, um...can't say as I remember.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You, you don't remember?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
How about a wager, my learned friend? You say it was this old man that the accused saw. But I would lay a thousand to one...against you being able to prove it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
AAAAAARGH!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Lord van Zieks, explain yourself!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...My Lord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If you had such a trenchant argument up your sleeve... ...why in the world did you not proffer it during the summation examination?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Hmph... I wanted to give this young foreign student the sightseeing experience he no doubt came for. I wanted him to see for himself how the opinion of the jury is so <span style="color:#E16935">readily swayed</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But my hospitality has its limits. And they have been reached, I feel. So, my learned friend...today's sightseeing tour of London is now over.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What, what are you talking about?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My Lord! The prosecution requests permission to call its next witnesses to the stand.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Granted. Bailiff! Bring forth the witnesses!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Its...next witnesses?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo, do you not remember? We've been told on several occasions that there were eye witnesses to the incident.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I remember. One of them being a Scotland Yard <span style="color:#E16935">policeman</span>, no less.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm afraid that's likely to be the prosecution's next witness.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright, no matter who van Zieks brings to the stand as his witnesses, and no matter what they say... ...I believe in Soseki-san! I know he's innocent! And I'll keep believing to the very end. Until this battle is over!)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
Witnesses, please state your names and occupations for the court.
</p><p>.........
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Constable Roly Beate, SAH! Nothin' to report on the streets, sah. .........
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
And I'm Mrs. Beate! Patricia's my name. I'm proud to say I'm this young town hero's wife!
</p><p>Roly:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...what's the story here?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Well, in truth, we've not been married long. In fact, we celebrated our first anniversary only the other day!
</p><p>Roly:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No no, it was your husband I was asking about. He seems...tired.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Hardly surprising. Whilst being an honourable occupation, patrolling the beat is the most demanding work in the world.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, really? <span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm sure I've heard that before, actually.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed, apart from rare days off, our gallant officers trudge some twenty miles a day, you know. They patrol boarding houses and pubs, collect taxes, survey the streets, check that meters are reading true... And they're responsible for keeping the streets clean, and lighting and extinguishing our streetlights.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There are a number of items on that list that don't sound much like policing duties at all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I wouldn't just be falling asleep on my feet, I'd have collapsed long ago!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But it goes without saying that a policeman's primary duty is the apprehension of criminals. Even when he's off duty, a constable is expected to investigate and resolve any crimes on his beat. For the London bobby is a man of honour.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...And a man of slumber.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
On the day in question... ...this man and his wife were walking down Briar Road in the opposite direction. And they witnessed the incident as it occurred. ...Is that not correct, Mr and Mrs Beate?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
That's right, sir! ...Isn't it, Roly?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
......... Constable Roly Beate, SAH! Nothin' to report on the streets, sah.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What a great witness he's going to be...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very good. I'd like to hear your formal testimonies now, please. You will tell the court exactly what you saw on the afternoon of the incident.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Yes, sah!
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span><br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- What the Witnesses Saw -</span></center>
<p>Patricia:<br />
It was our wedding anniversary, and Roly was taking me out for a meal. There was no time to change after work.<br />
Anyway, two silhouettes appeared out of the fog on the pavement in front of us.<br />
All of a sudden, one of them just collapsed on the floor. Then the other scattered something before running off!<br />
We ran straight over of course, and then went for help at a nearby police box.<br />
It was definitely that Japanese man in the dock. Roly and I both saw him as clear as day!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Well...this is extremely compelling testimony, I must say.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear, this policeman and his wife are claiming to have positively identified Mr Natsume at the scene. If their testimony is true... ...the alternative course of events that you established in the summation examination will be quashed.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Its death knell, in fact. Because that 'alternative' was never viable in the first place.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What an unfortunate bechancing. And on your wedding anniversary, too.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh, I know! But I still managed to go out for the evening with my man! I thank the Lord for that!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Gosh, the life of a London 'bobby' sounds very hard indeed.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Indeed. However... ...this cross-examination will be over in minutes. You may well have time to rest this afternoon.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My learned friend, the witnesses saw the face of the man fleeing the scene. They are testifying under oath that it was without doubt the accused, Mr Soseki Natsume.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And one of these witnesses is a policeman, no less. So you appreciate the gravity of the situation, I'm sure.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Except that the man's so tired, his <span style="color:#E16935">wife</span> has to do all the talking...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Enough preamble. Counsel for the Defence, commence the cross-examination, please.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Y-Yes, My Lord!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No time to change after work, you say? Are you also a member of the police, Mrs Beate?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh no, sadly not. It's a job for strapping young men only. Women, children and the elderly can't even apply.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...I think you can probably see why children and the elderly can't do the job, can't you?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
I think Roly looks ever so handsome in his uniform. ...It suits you down the ground, doesn't it, darling?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Hm? Wha...? ...Ah, I'd just finished my beat. Pat and I were heading back to the station. I was actually planning on getting changed there.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is, is he talking in his sleep? This is creepy...)</span>
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh no, Roly. I much prefer you in uniform. Sometimes I don't recognise you when I see you in plain clothes.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear, that doesn't seem...healthy.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Kindly adhere to the point. You were going for a meal after you had finished your beat for the day, correct?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
That's right, sah, yes. Although I was fit to drop, to be honest. After spending the whole day on my feet. But policing is my life, sah! As long as I'm the proud owner of this, I'll serve my city and my Queen to the end!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...What's that now?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
My warrant card, sah! Proof that I'm a London copper. It has the noble founding principles of the force written on it as a reminder to all us policemen of our sworn duty. To patrol the streets of London town and uphold the peace of the common man... SAH! And for such a noble cause, I cover twenty miles every single day without fail and without a grumble! Because the plodding of my boots is all Londoners need to hear to feel safe and secure!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...fighting crime doesn't appear to come into it, then...
</p><p>Roly:<br />
But SAH! Just on that one particular day, I was looking forward to celebrating my wedding anniversary. Mrs Beate puts up with a lot being married to a bobby like me. I wanted to show my dear wife how much I care!
</p><p>Oh, Pat...
<span style="float: right;">Oh, Roly...</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, what a charming couple! Their young love is such a joy to behold!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...If a little...over-the-top, perhaps?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And then...? Kindly describe what happened next.

My husband's a policeman, remember! And I know what I saw! I remember every last detail! Everything! Like, like... Oh, I know! What about the books the man dropped? I could tell you the names of every single one, I could! Every single one! And you dare to question how reliable my testimony is!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That will do, Mrs Beate.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
No, it won't do at all! That Japanese lawyer has no idea what I'm capable of! Even if I decide to forgive him for insulting us, don't think for a minute that Roly will!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Two 'silhouettes'?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
That's right. They were coming towards us, walking up Briar Road in the opposite direction. There was a rather plump figure followed by a scrawny, thin-looking man.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That does sound exactly like the victim as pictured in this print. And like Mr Natsume.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, unfortunately, it does.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And you're certain that at that time there was nobody else nearby?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh yes, quite certain. It was dark, but there are streetlights on Briar Road, you see. There was nobody else around at all. ...Isn't that right, my darling?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Hm? Wha...? ...Ah yes, that's right. Of course, there was a light fog on the ground. But Briar Road is dead straight and you could see a fairly long way down the pavement. And then there's the streetlighting as well. I didn't see any...other...pedestrianzzz...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Before sleep takes a firm hold, your answer, please, Mr Beate. ...Are you quite sure of what you've just said?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Yes, SAH! As a copper who spends all day every day keeping watch on the streets, I'd swear to it, sah! I'm as sure...as my love for Patricia is true!
</p><p>Oh, Pat...
<span style="float: right;">Oh, Roly...</span>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hm... They're still maintaining there was no one else around other than the victim and the attacker. It's starting to seem like that must be how it really happened.)</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...that didn't stop Mr Natsume, did it? He fled the scene all too convincingly.

That's why I sent Patricia, you see. I told her where to find the right police box.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...forgive my ignorance, but what do you mean exactly by '<span style="color:#E16935">the right police box</span>'?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Depends on a crime's location, you see, as to who deals with it. Where the woman was stabbed wasn't actually on my beat. So I told Patricia the way to the police box for the beat the incident fell under so she could go...and report...it.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
I ran there as quickly as I could and asked for help from the bobby on duty. There is nothing more potent than a young couple in love working together, you know.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And thanks to your swift response, the case was quickly resolved. The actions...of two model citizens.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh please! You're making us blush! ...Isn't he, darling?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Yes SAH! What Patricia said, sah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Let's move on, shall we?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But surely you wouldn't have been able to see his face by the light of the gas streetlamps, would you?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
We absolutely could! Us Londoners have exceptional eyesight, I'll have you know!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Right.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
The light from the streetlamps was more than enough! And my husband already told you that the fog was only light, didn't he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Haah... Yes, and what of the fog?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
We're famous for it across the globe, I believe. But it's an absolute menace to those of us who have to live with it, of course.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh, it is, it is. When it's thick, you can't even see the hand at the end of your own arm.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes, alright, I take your point. Now...could you stop shaking your husband about?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
The constant fog makes our eyes very sharp, you see. That's why we can tell you for sure and certain that it was that little Japanese man we saw. Can't we darling?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Hm? Wha...? ...Ah. Yes. It was the accused and no mistake. The moustache, the hunched back, the cat-like eyes, the taut mouth, the snub nozzz... Unmistakable, SAH!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, we know that there were books dropped at the scene of the crime, as you say.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Those purchased by the accused at the nearby secondhand bookshop on the day in question.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
After I'd been to the police box for help, I... Well, I decided to have a good look over the area for good measure. I am a proud policeman's wife, after all! I did it for Roly!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And...what was your husband doing at the time?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh, he was lying face down in the snow. Getting some well-deserved rest. He works ever so hard, you know. Ever so hard! ...Don't you, my darling?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Interesting way of guarding the scene of the crime.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, Mrs Beate, seeing as you've regaled the court with tales of your powers of recollection... ...would you be so kind as to recount the titles of the books you observed at the scene?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
I'd be happy to. Now, are you all listening? There was 'The Picture of Monsieur Somebody-or-other'. And...'Whatsit Yearnings'... Then there was, um...'A Meal for...Someone' and the last one was definitely...'The Thingummy's Something'. ...You see?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... ...Yes, I see there are one or two holes in your memory.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh well, they were along those lines, I'm quite sure.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
There were indeed books found at the scene with titles 'along those lines' as you put it.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Well, what did I tell you? So I think it's very mean the way you've been implying that my testimony can't be trusted. Don't you agree, darling?
</p><p>Roly:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...you're saying that there were four books?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
That's right. I remember all of them. 'The Picture of Monsieur Somebody', 'Whatsit Yearnings', 'A Meal for Someone' and 'The Thingummy's Something'.

...I'm sorry, Mrs Beate... ...but there is a fundamental flaw in that statement of yours.

Oh no! What, what flaw?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Simply that, at the scene of the crime...there were only <span style="color:#E16935">three books</span>, not four!
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This is the receipt from the bookshop where the defendant bought his books.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
'Yore Books'...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, and it details Mr Natsume's purchases that day. But as you can see...only <span style="color:#E16935">three books</span> are listed.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Only three...? But...no...no, that can't be! I remember seeing them! There were four books, I tell you! Four dirty old books!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh really? Have a good look at this photographic print of the scene of the crime. As you can clearly see from this evidence as well, there are only three books!
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
But...I just don't believe it! I saw them there! I swear it! I saw them!

No madam, I'm afraid your powers of observation cannot be relied upon.

</p><p>Patricia:<br />
No!

</p><p>Susato:<br />
What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, I hate to admit it, but on hearing the testimony... ...it really does seem as though Mr and Mrs Beate saw what they say they saw. Mr Natsume running away from the scene on Briar Road that day.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Yes, I feel the same.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So if that's true, where does it leave us?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The members of the jury are sure to call for a guilty verdict after this testimony.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh no! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Then what do we do?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... If Kazuma-sama were here...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! What are you trying to say?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I think he would try to find <span style="color:#E16935">a contradiction</span> somewhere else within their testimony.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean, 'somewhere else'?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Their statement about seeing Mr Natsume is unequivocal. Calling that into question won't help. But if you could identify some other part of their testimony which appears to contradict the facts... ...you might be able to discredit them! To make the jury doubt if the pair's memory of the day is accurate!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...right...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Put simply, we must focus on finding a discrepancy in these statements somewhere. If we don't, I'm afraid the trial may reach an early and unfavourable conclusion.

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It's plainly evident... ...that it is your powers of deduction that cannot be relied upon, my learned Nipponese friend.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What cannot be denied is that these two witnesses saw the accused running from the scene. A fact that you know very well you have no hope of disproving.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So you've striven to avert attention from that by dint of some inconsequential discrepancies. Would that be...fair?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Ugh. <span style="color:#0070C0">(He sees right through me...)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But your plan has somewhat recoiled against you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What are you talking about?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It's quite simple. Let me explain with a toast. To the policeman's wife, and her <span style="color:#E16935">entirely accurate</span> testimony. ...In every respect.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You see, the matter is not up for debate. At the scene on Briar Road, a total of <span style="color:#E16935">four books</span> were most definitely found.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but what about the photographic print? It only shows <span style="color:#E16935">three books</span>!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Quite right. Only three can be seen...in that print.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That print? You, you mean to say...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Allow me to present another! ...One that shows the victim's hand.
</p><p>I, I don't believe it!<br />
It's...it's the fourth book!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As you will observe... ...the fourth book was hidden from view in the original print by the victim's torso.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No... NOOOOOOOOO!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar!
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
There! You see? You see?! Look at that! Look, look, look!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
It's just like I said! ...Isn't it, my darling?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Yes, SAH! Patricia's always right, sah!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Let us study the receipt for the books purchased by the accused on the day in question. Mrs Beate, the titles once again, if you please.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh yes, of course. 'The Picture of Monsieur Somebody-or-other'...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...'The Picture of Monsieur Lecoq'.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
'Whatsit Yearnings'...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...'Canterbury Yearnings'.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
'A Meal for Someone'...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...'A Meal for Gaboriau', in fact. As the court has just heard, the witness remembers the book titles <span style="color:#E16935">flawlessly</span>, save for a few minor details. Mrs Beate's powers of recollection can only be described as exceptional.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Did you hear that, Roly? The gentleman paid me a compliment!
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Yes SAH! Flawless, sah! Patricia is flawless!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
B-But...there are only three books on the receipt. And Mrs Beate mentioned four.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
There's nothing surprising about that. Clearly the fourth book is that which is shown in this photographic print.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I'm sorry, Counsel, but does that not seem odd? Why should the fourth book be omitted from the receipt?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It's not odd at all, My Lord. As the photograph clearly shows, the fourth book was found in the victim's clutches. In other words...it <span style="color:#E16935">belongs to the victim</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The victim...was holding her own book?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I wonder...what became of that fourth book?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Obviously, it wasn't overlooked by the investigating officers at Scotland Yard. I have it here, as evidence.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You will submit that and the aforementioned photographic print to the court, please, Counsel.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...My pleasure, My Lord.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The second crime scene photograph has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The fourth book has been entered into the Court Record.</span>

...<span style="color:#E16935">A fire</span>, My Lord.

<p>Garrideb:<br />
'Fraid to say it was. Happened in the blink of an eye, you know. The whole place filled with smoke. Couldn't see a bally thing. Didn't take long for the fire to spread, of course. The bally furniture started going up as well! Worst of it is, I lost my favourite. Book called 'The Lion's Pride'.

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
This is risible! All you've told the court is that a book by the same name was involved in a fire. In which case, it would be reasonable to assume that it was burnt to ashes. And entirely unreasonable...to infer that it magically removed itself to the scene of the crime.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Perhaps it would make more sense...if I told you that the cause of the fire was...marital discord. Without going into details, it appears that Mrs Garrideb was considerably enraged. Apparently she continued to attack Mr Garrideb even amid the flames.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh, how awful! I can't even imagine being so horrid to the one you love. ...Can you, Roly?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Absolutely not, SAH! My Patricia would never raise a finger against me, sah!

<p>Garrideb:<br />
Had all my favourite old novels in that case. But as soon as the fire got hold of them, that was it. Whoosh! Up in smoke! Then the wife started hurling things at me. There was I, back up against the window, <span style="color:#E16935">under heavy enemy fire</span>! Incendiary books incoming ten to the dozen.

The man had his back up against the window...and he had <span style="color:#E16935">burning books thrown at him</span>? Goodness gracious! Are, are you suggesting... ...that the book was thrown through a window and...and landed coincidentally at the scene of the crime?

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
No. A thorough investigation of the surrounding area was conducted the very evening of the incident. And there is no report of the Garridebs' window pane being broken.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's quite true. We also saw no sign of broken glass when we visited the Garrideb household. But is it not conceivable that <span style="color:#E16935">the window was open</span> at the time in-
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Not even remotely! Let us not forget the season, and the chilling weather that accompanies it. No Londoner would ever leave a window open in the middle of winter.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... Does the defence postulate this scenario in all seriousness, Counsel? Do you earnestly claim that the book found at the scene was a flaming projectile thrown by Mr Garrideb's wife?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I believe it's a possibility, My Lord.
</p><p>
???:</p><center>That's quite enough!</center>

Well... ...it would appear that the ladies and gentlemen of the jury are once again in full agreement. What is your position, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
In truth, My Lord...I feel these have been unnecessarily protracted proceedings. But then one must always exercise patience in order to savour the best vintage.

Of course. The defence has the right to another summation examination at this point. You could still convince the jurors to change their minds. You have one more chance!

If there was some novel alternative explanation about how the victim was stabbed, I might reconsider...
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Even if the woman was throwing books, it can't be related to this crime if the window was closed, can it?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Dearie me, it was only a little book! Hardly life-threatening, even with a direct hit!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Look, I just want to get this over with. If I don't bring home some pay tonight, I'll be in a tidy bit of trouble.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Come to think of it, we had a fire at home a while ago. It gave me the sneezes.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Hm, yes...considerably more tangible arguments from all members of the jury this time around, it seems. ...With one notable exception, of course.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My learned student friend was unable to find fault in the previous witness testimony.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So the court must accept the fact that it was indeed the accused seen fleeing from the scene. And moreover... ...no one else was even at the scene to commit the crime!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, if the eye witnesses are correct...it would seem as if the conclusion is somewhat <span style="color:#E16935">set in stone</span>. I fail to see how it can be argued any other way.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...That means, I'm afraid, that during this summation examination... ...it's essential that you establish some other tangible explanation for the facts!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But how? What would even constitute <span style="color:#E16935">a tangible explanation</span> here?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Isn't it obvious? Who stabbed the woman and how? Those two details are all you need provide. Simply give us <span style="color:#E16935">a name</span> and <span style="color:#E16935">a method</span> by which the attack was conducted.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...And there I was thinking this might be hard.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But Mr Naruhodo, you have to do it! Otherwise this really will be where the trial ends!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh, no pressure then...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That's quite enough preamble. Proceed with the summation examination, please. I presume you are prepared, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, yes! ...My Lord. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright, Ryunosuke, focus your mind now... Clearly, the key to this summation examination... ...is going to be juror number four, the maid. Or should I say, Mrs Garrideb?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We have a book that disappeared from the Garridebs' house on the evening of the incident... ...and the fourth book found in the victim's hand.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There must be a way to link the two. Yes, that's what we have to find... <span style="color:#0070C0">(...using every technique I've learnt in my short career so far! Whatever it takes!)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Don't forget to keep an eye on Mrs Garrideb and <span style="color:#E16935">how she reacts</span>...even to the things other people say!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But as we now know, there were four books, not three!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Well? What difference does it make?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There's every possibility that the fourth book...in fact belongs to the defendant's landlord!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Yes, that's the part I have a problem with.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Well, at the point the woman was stabbed, this landlord fellow was at home, wasn't he? Enjoying a fiery scrap with his wife or something, you said.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That's not exactly how I put it, no.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Well anyway, the point is, the fellow and his wife were somewhere else when it happened.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I think...that's what you call a strong alibi.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
So it couldn't have been the landlord who did it. Which only leaves the Nipponese fellow. Honestly, I can't see what all this palaver's about. It's a done deal, isn't it?

So...you might be willing to change your decision, you mean?!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Oh my! Such delight on your face! But I'm afraid I shan't be swayed by emotion. Despite what you may think of me, I am a very modern, metropolitan and rational woman.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That's great.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
If one reads the morning papers, it's all forgotten by tea time, isn't it? So why read them in the first place? You see? Modern, metropolitan and rational thinking, wouldn't you say?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...And not at all extreme.
</p><p>Juror No, 2:<br />
As I see it, an overwhelmingly suspicious Japanese man has been implicated by overwhelmingly strong testimony. So despite one or two minor puzzlements, I do declare that the man is overwhelmingly guilty! ...Modern, metropolitan and rational logic, wouldn't you say?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Overwhelmingly.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
But us modern 'gals' are always delighted to embrace new fads, you know. So I'd be only too happy to consider an exciting <span style="color:#E16935">new theory</span> if you could come up with one!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'd be happy to do that, too...if only I could.)</span>

Let's do our very best not to disappoint the modern and metropolitan young lady!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How can you be so sure?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
The prosecutor fellow over there said it earlier, didn't he? Winters in London are no joke. You don't want to invite that sort of cold indoors. So no, that window wasn't open. Us Londoners like sitting by the fire and staying warm, see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But you couldn't categorically state that the window wasn't open, could you?

It just wasn't. They wouldn't have opened it.

They do? How exactly, Counsel?

Don't point at me again! I told you, it wasn't me!

Did you hear juror number six's account of his birthday celebrations last year? It seems, despite being a Londoner, he once opened his windows in the middle of winter.

Well yes, of course. Because it was an emergency. I mean, obviously, if the room was filled with smoke from a fire, then you'd be mad not...to open the... ......... Oh!

Exactly. On the day in question, at the time of the incident, there was a fire in the Garrideb household. And Mr Garrideb had the following to say about it: 'The whole place filled with smoke.'

Oh dearie me! What is the meaning of this? How dare you imply that I'm hiding who I really am!

It's imperative that you confirm something for the court. So please, it's time to drop the pretence now.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Wh-What is it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
When the fire started in your house that day, did you or your husband open the window?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Wha...? I, I beg your pardon? What are you insinuating?!

......... And what if we did?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Oh, alright then. ...Yes, you're right. My husband was frantically trying to open the window. Which can't have been easy, since I continued to give him a justly deserved book battering.

...Even though your house was on fire?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Oh, you never stop throwing until the anger subsides. It would be terribly bad for the nerves to do otherwise.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Of course. I should have realised.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's a significant step forward, Mr Naruhodo. You've managed to establish that <span style="color:#E16935">the window was open</span>. We simply must have that added to Mrs Garrideb's formal statement.

...There's really no such thing as a 'loving' incendiary bomb.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Well he brought it upon himself! It's playing with fire to betray a fiery love! Isn't it? ...Well? Don't you agree?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Erm...well...any kind of betrayal is...is certainly a bad thing, yes. But I think the argument might have arisen out of your misunderstanding, Mrs Garrideb...
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Never you mind that! The point is, we were just having a jovial little dispute, nothing more! And I won't have any more of these suggestions that it was anything whatsoever to do with this crime!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

The fourth book found at the scene of the crime shows very obvious signs of fire damage. And the title of the book...is 'The Lion's Pride'. <span style="color:#E16935">The same title</span>, in fact, as the book that Mr Garrideb told us he had been reading.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
......... Well, I really couldn't say.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
On the day in question, did you or did you not throw at your husband... ...the copy of 'The Lion's Pride' that he had been reading?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
......... I did.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
It was the first thing I could lay my hands on. So I hurled it straight at him! And now you come to mention it, yes... ...he was rather enjoying reading it, you're right.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Why did you not reveal this information to the court from the outset?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Because I couldn't, you insolent little man! I didn't remember! At times like that, you pick up and throw whatever you can lay your hands on, as well you know!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I really don't.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
I barely noticed I was throwing a book, much less the title of it!

It was listening to what this granny was saying. Brought it all flooding back.

</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
It, it was about two weeks ago now. I'd just got back home after work, like. I put my hand in my pocket for the wages I'd just earnt that day...and I nearly died. There was a hole. Every last penny had dropped out.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh dear, what a disaster.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
You haven't heard the half of it, boy.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
The wife was cutting up some chicken at the time. I, I could hardly get the words out, but I told her straight: 'I've lost the day's wages, luv.' Next thing I knew, the blade was whistling past my ear. Stuck into the wall next to me, it did. About an inch deep.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(No words... Just...terror...)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
I could smell it then, you know. That God-awful stench of the Thames. I was sure I was going to end up face down in the muddy banks that night, I can tell you. Now...that's a real disaster, isn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I'll never use the word lightly again.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is this: When women lose their rag, they'll throw anything at you! Knives, hatchets, hammers...you name it!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo! You mustn't think that all women are so short-tempered and unrefined!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No no, I wasn't thinking that!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Throwing household objects at people is... Well, it's so uncivilised. At least attack with honour! Using a bow or the like.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? Attack? ...Who are you going to attack?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Never mind. Anyway, this man's words... ...could be rather significant, I think.

Your wife really threw a kitchen knife at you?

That's right. She was chopping meat with it. ...Had a tidy edge on it, believe me. Still...it's all memories, isn't it? It started with that smile  she threw me when we were courting.

...Your wife must be even beefier than you.

And things came to a head last week when she threw me. Right into the Thames. Still...she's not so bad when she's calmed down. She's a little sweetheart, really.

...I'm...so happy for you.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />

Anyway, I mustered all my puff to blow them out... ...only I must have blown wrong somehow. The flames didn't go out, but candles went flying all over the room! The furniture caught and everything went up! The whole place filled with smoke!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Definitely sounds like devil-worship to me.)</span> And...by 'the sneezes', I presume you mean a cold. But how did you catch a cold from a fire?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
What a fiasco it was. The grandchildren, bless them, threw water over me as they tried to put out the flames. And then, because the whole room had filled up with smoke of course... ...we had to open all the windows to clear it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The windows...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
The biting winter air rushed over me like the devil dancing on my grave, it did! I caught a terrible cold from it. It put me in hospital for a while. ...I won't forget that birthday in a hurry!

Juror number four! Do you have something to say about that?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mrs Garrideb!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Oh dearie me! What is the meaning of this? How dare you imply that I'm hiding who I really am!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's imperative that you confirm something for the court. So please, it's time to drop the pretence now.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Wh-What is it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
When the fire started in your house that day, did you or your husband open the window?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Wha...? I, I beg your pardon? What are you insinuating?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The room would have been thick with smoke after the carpet and bookcase caught fire as they did. In a situation like that...it's inconceivable that you wouldn't have opened the window!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
......... And what if we did?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Oh, alright then. ...Yes, you're right. My husband was frantically trying to open the window. Which can't have been easy, since I continued to give him a justly deserved book battering.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Even though your house was on fire?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Oh, you never stop throwing until the anger subsides. It would be terribly bad for the nerves to do otherwise.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Of course. I should have realised.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's a significant step forward, Mr Naruhodo. You've managed to establish that <span style="color:#E16935">the window was open</span>. We simply must have that added to Mrs Garrideb's formal statement.
</p><p><i>Changes Juror No. 3's statement to "The window could have been open when the woman was throwing books. I mean, it's definitely a possibility." and Juror No. 4's statement to "Now you mention it, yes, the window was open at the time. I'd clean forgotten, but it's true."</i>
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Therefore, to clear the smoke, either Mr Garrideb or his wife almost certainly opened the window. That, you cannot deny, would be in no way out of the ordinary!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
No...I suppose it wouldn't.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
When you get to my age, you learn a thing or two, you know. And I can tell you... ...you'd have to be a prize idiot not to open the window if there was a fire! Eh?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Yes! Of course! I, I think I need to reconsider my statement.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! Please do. <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's a step in the right direction...I think.)</span>

An alternative explanation...as to how the victim was stabbed in the back.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
What are you talking about?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We've demonstrated that the fourth book - 'The Lion's Pride' - that was found at the scene of the crime... ...originated in Mr Garrideb's room on the top floor of his house. Therefore it's equally possible that some other object besides the book... ...could have <span style="color:#E16935">found its way</span> from the Garrideb household to the street below.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Eh? What's that now?

After all, Mrs Garrideb could have thrown any number of different objects at her husband. ...Isn't that right, juror number four?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm beginning to think that...ever since <span style="color:#E16935">the true origins</span> of this book came to light... ...perhaps she's <span style="color:#E16935">had a feeling</span> this might be what happened.)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Now you listen here, you Eastern galah! As the foreman of this jury, I demand a straight answer. You give us this yarn about <span style="color:#E16935">some other object</span> making its way out of the house...but what? What was it?

......... Juror number four...Mrs Garrideb...
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Wha...? What now?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I must apologise in advance for this... ...but I need you to confirm something else for the court. This knife... Have you ever seen this knife before?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good Lord, Counsel! What on earth are you doing? That's <span style="color:#E16935">the weapon</span> that was lodged into the victim's back, man!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My Lord, remember that when the victim was attacked, Mr and Mrs Garrideb were in the throes of an argument. Mrs Garrideb was hurling anything she could at her husband, who'd been backed up against the window. A window that had been opened to clear the smoke...and through which a book sailed to land <span style="color:#E16935">at the crime scene</span>.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
You can't seriously believe that! The book...was found in the victim's grasp!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Are you saying that it flew out of the window and across the street to land neatly in her hand?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Huh! Even my missus hasn't got an aim like that!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I admit...there are many details we don't yet understand. But that's the point! That's precisely why... ...we must not allow this trial to end! Not right now!

Thank you, madam!

Yes, I agree. I certainly didn't see this coming, but... ...I just don't think it would be right for this trial to come to an end now with so many unanswered questions.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Foreman!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
......... I'd have to agree. Not that I think the granny did it, mind.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
...Yes, you know what? I'm not quite happy about this at the moment, either.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
All together now, ladies and gents...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We... We...did it...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, congratulations, Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, as a result of the defence's summation examination, a number of jurors' leanings have changed. Two jurors call guilty, against four now calling innocent. Accordingly, the opinion of this court is divided... ...and this trial will continue!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Now then, Lord van Zieks...how does the prosecution wish to proceed?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...This trial is rapidly descending into a farce. Like a corked wine...the first few sips are bitter enough... ...but what follows is so repugnant, it's good for nothing save the gutter!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
If, if I may, Lord van Zieks... ...the defence has just put forward a credible alternative explanation for what happened.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Credible? Is that your considered opinion, Mr Foreman? The defence's argument is a joke to which I barely know how to respond. But let me start by insisting... ...that you must familiarise yourselves better with <span style="color:#E16935">the relative positions</span> of those places being discussed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean by that? <span style="color:#0070C0">(...What's his angle this time?)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It should already be more than apparent, that between the crime scene and the Garrideb household... ...runs a rather wide street, <span style="color:#E16935">Briar Road</span>. Which means that the distance from the Garridebs' house to the scene is some... Yes, fifteen yards.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Let me see... Fifteen yards... That's around fourteen metres.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
F-Fourteen metres? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh. ...That's a little farther than I'd imagined.)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And, as you ladies and gentlemen of the jury rightly noted as having portentous significance... ...the fourth book was found <span style="color:#E16935">in the victim's clutches</span>. In other words...the smouldering book, wantonly hurled by the lady of the house travelled some fifteen yards... ...to land on the opposite side of the road, neatly between the collapsed victim's fingers and thumb. ...Is that your final conclusion, my learned...and deluded friend?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! Um...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And did the jackknife follow a near identical trajectory to plunge into the middle of the victim's back? This fantasy is somewhat stretching the notion of 'having a bad day' for the victim, I think. Even those pathetic serialised detective stories have more believable plots!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
AAAAAAAAAGH!!! ......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(There's nothing I can say to that...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That...that prosecutor loves the sound of his own voice!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Susato!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Serialised detective stories are pathetic, are they?! How dare he?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um... Maybe let's pick our battles here...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
My Lord, might I be allowed to speak?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
As judicial assistant, you may speak for the defence, yes. Go ahead.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The prosecution may consider the idea a fantasy... ...but what the defence has postulated was believable enough to persuade the jury to change its leaning. And as such...the court has a duty to explore this alternative explanation as thoroughly as possible!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
To that end... ......... ...juror number four - Mrs Joan Garrideb...must be called to testify and submit to cross-examination!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Saints alive! A cross-examination of a juror?! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Well...this, this is highly irregular. It is unprecedented for a member of the jury to be summoned to the witness stand.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And unnecessary.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
L-Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
There are already witnesses in the stand whose testimony the defence may further cross-examine. If my learned friend's farcical theory has any truth in it... ...then both a burning book and a jackknife must have flown through the sky before this couple's eyes. And we must assume they would be able to testify accordingly.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... What say you, witnesses?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
......... Yes, SAH! Constable Roly Beate reporting for duty, sah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

Oh, they are so heroic, these 'London bobbies'.
</p><p>Roly:<br />

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. I hereby reject the defence's request...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...and order the witnesses in the stand to testify again. State forthwith before the court any details pertaining to the defence's <span style="color:#E16935">alternative explanation of events</span>.

<p>Roly:<br />
This case has nothing to do with Mr and Mrs Garrideb. Believe me, a London bobby is good for his word!<br />
You see - SAH! - the windows on the top floor of the Garrideb house are <span style="color:#E16935">top-hinged casements</span>.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Obviously, if anything had been thrown out of the window, we would have seen it.<br />
I did leave the scene to go and fetch help, but my trusty Roly was there to make sure nothing was disturbed.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
I didn't take my eye off the crime scene for one moment, sah! Nothing strange to report on that front, sah!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Well, this is quite startling. <span style="color:#E16935">Top-hinged casement windows</span>!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
That detail was not in the police report, Constable.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Ah, yes, um... Sorry about that. I...must have been a little drowsy... Ahem.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You cannot excuse your sins with drowsiness every time, Constable.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
No, SAH!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...sorry, but... ...what exactly is <span style="color:#E16935">a top-hinged casement window</span>?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And you... You cannot excuse your ignorance with such trite remarks, my learned friend.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Of course...sorry.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I've found it, Mr Naruhodo! Cast your mind back to the windows in Mr and Mrs Garrideb's room...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright, I'll try...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So the window opens in order to allow air to circulate inside the house. But as it's <span style="color:#E16935">a top-hinged casement window</span>, it swings open along the upper edge, you see.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I'm glad you've rectified your ignorance. A casement window's most prominent feature... ...is its '<span style="color:#E16935">stay</span>' - a metal bar which prevents the window from being opened beyond a certain amount.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It, it <span style="color:#E16935">prevents it opening</span>? <span style="color:#0070C0">(This is all news to me!)</span>
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Absolutely correct, sah! In other words, if a book or knife were to have been thrown through the open window... ...it would have clattered against the pane and fallen straight down to the pavement below.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You see the problem, then? Good...your education in windows is complete. There was never any possibility of either the book or the knife travelling fifteen yards over the road. That is, unless the window pane had been shattered... something we've discounted already.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Th-That can't... BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Did you see that, Roly? That young Japanese man just collapsed in agony!
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Oh yes, my darling. I saw it. I saw how he crumbled before me.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh, Roly! You're so strong!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(How is this happening? I haven't even started the cross-examination yet, and already my argument's been destroyed.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Counsel, if you could drag yourself upright again...the court awaits your cross-examination.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How can you say that for certain?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
...A very good question, sah. And the answer...is this! It has the noble founding principles of the force written on it as a reminder to all us policemen of our sworn duty.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
He showed us that before, didn't he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Did he? <span style="color:#0070C0">(I can't say I remember.)</span>
</p><p>Roly:<br />
To patrol the streets of London town and uphold the peace of the common man... It's what the job's all about! And that is why I can stand here today beside my long-suffering wife and tell you a bobby's good for his word! ...While rubbing my tired eyes admittedly...SAH!
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh, Roly...you're so manly!
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Of course I am, my darling Patricia!
</p><p>Oh, Pat...
<span style="float: right;">Oh, Roly...</span>
</p><p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
......... No, none of this is what I meant. I meant, how can you say for certain that this case has <span style="color:#E16935">nothing to do</span> with Mr and Mrs Garrideb?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Ah, I see, sah! You should have said so earlier, sah.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes, well... So, could you answer the question? <span style="color:#0070C0">(That was a waste of time, then.)</span>
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Absolutely, sah! I will answer it to the fullest of my abilities, sah! There's a surprising reason why Mr and Mrs Garrideb's domestic dispute can't be related to this case. ...But before I get into that, sah, just one thing...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
I'd very much like you and all your countrymen to understand the great British institution of Scotland Yard. So I hope you'll take back some tales of us London bobbies and how we uphold our <span style="color:#E16935">guiding principles</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I wasn't planning on going back just yet. I've only just arrived here.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
So to that end - SAH! - I'd be happy to lend you my warrant card for your perusal. But I must warn you...you won't be able to get through it without shedding a few tears!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Thank you. I'll...try.

I heard that! That Japanese man thinks a policeman's wife's word counts for nothing, does he? Well watch out, sir! I might let you get away with something like that, but my Roly won't!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
By which you mean they don't open fully...is that correct?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Yes, sah! They're just there to allow a bit of air through the house, you see. So they're restricted as to how much they open.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And therefore anything thrown out of the window from inside the room... ...would simply strike the pane and fall to the street directly below. For clarity, allow me to mark the map. Here...is <span style="color:#E16935">the location where objects would have fallen</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm, yes... <span style="color:#E16935">Directly opposite</span> the scene of the crime, on the other side of the rather wide road.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Would it have been so hard for somebody to mention this top-hinged casement thing before?)</span> Well...I have another question for you, Constable.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
And what would that be, sah?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How do you even know? Why would you have any idea what sort of windows Mr and Mrs Garrideb's house is furnished with?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Ah, well sah... That's very simple. You see, I helped with the investigation yesterday.

Oh, I was just remembering, that's all. We really were...so lucky.

Lucky? What do you mean?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Well, of course I feel terrible for the poor woman who was attacked. Don't misunderstand me, please. But we were just so lucky it didn't happen on Roly's beat. It was so close, you see!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh... I hadn't realised.

Constable Beate!

Hm? ...Oh! Y-Yes, that's right. That's the reason I was helping out with interviewing the occupants of the Garrideb household yesterday. Their house is on my beat, you see...sah.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hm, that really was cutting it close then...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Constable, I wonder if you could clarify something... If the Garrideb household is on your beat, does that mean that the pavement next to it is as well?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Outside Mr Garrideb's house? Yes, ma'am! The pavement on that side of the road is part of my beat!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I see... I was unaware of that.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Just think, if the woman had been attacked just on the other side of Briar Road... ...we would never have been able to go for that meal to celebrate our wedding anniversary! But...that's the life of a bobby, after all.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Extraordinary people, our bobbies. Tirelessly working for the benefit of all Londoners.

Oh, but Roly and I were strolling along, gazing at the night sky and looking for our lucky star!

The star that will guide us to eternal happiness!

If a flaming book had cut across the sky in front of us... ...it would have lit up like a shooting star.

And if I'd seen a shooting star, I would have made a wish upon it! 'Let Roly be an inspector,' I would have said! Three times at least!

Of course, what with the smog and everything, we couldn't actually see any stars...

Yes, sah, that is correct, SAH! As sure as the night sky in London is starless, sah!

So Roly told me the way. Only...I sort of got a little lost on the way.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Patricia, my darling...that's why I love you. Your terrible sense of direction is bewitching to me!
</p><p>Oh, Pat...

Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh, please...)</span>
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
So, I suppose I was gone for about fifteen minutes. But like I said, my Roly was at the scene the whole time, making sure nothing was disturbed!
</p><p>Roly:<br />
I was off duty at the time, of course, but...a true bobby is never really off duty, SAH!

Mrs Beate, nobody is questioning what you've told us.

I saw it, I did! That evening, I saw it clearly! That little Eastern man with the whiskers and the funny curved back, slinking away from the scene!

Haah...
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
And I know what I didn't see, as well. I didn't see any flaming books or knives flying through the sky!

...All very clear. You, you also mentioned something about having a poor sense of direction?

Constable Beate! ...Is there a problem?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
......... Eh? Ah...hm? Ah, no sah... No problem, sah.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Did your wife's remark just now bring something to mind, perhaps?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Oh, um...well...in a way, sah...yes, sah. I, I was just remembering that the same thing happened that evening, is all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! You mean, Mrs Beate lost her way? On the night of the incident?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Well, you see, I sent her off to find a police box in the next beat over from mine. But she was gone a fair bit longer than what I was expecting. I thought she'd be back inside ten minutes, but my darling was gone a good fifteen.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh, Roly! You're such a tease! But the reason I was so long was because of the bouquet, silly.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
...The bouquet?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry, what bouquet are you talking about?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh, it was a present for our wedding anniversary. ...Roly's so romantic! He saved up for it with farthings and ha'pennies he found in the gutter while doing his rounds!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...how romantic!
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
I'd forgotten all about it until just now. ...Had you, my darling?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Aaaaaaaaah! Hm? ...Ah! Oh, yes... But that...was just...between us... No talking about it to anyone else, darling. You have to promizzz...
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Really? ...Oh.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

I'm afraid I can't offer any useful insight, Mr Naruhodo. But I'm quite sure of one thing: We have to ask Mrs Beate about <span style="color:#E16935">the bouquet</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You mean you dropped the bouquet at the scene of the crime?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Yes, that's right. Oh, I was so upset. When we ran over and saw it was a woman with a knife in her back... ...I was so shocked, I dropped the bouquet Roly gave me. It was in a dark spot where the streetlights weren't casting any light, so I didn't notice at first.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And then you went to the police box to report it to the policeman whose beat it was on?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Yes! And I came back to the scene together with the other constable, you see. That's when I spotted my bouquet again. But the funny thing was, when I went to pick it up... ...it was nowhere near the victim's body at all!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...In case you need reminding, Mrs Beate, the victim is not deceased.

...Your husband, presumably?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
That's right! Silly me, I'd gone over to the wrong side of the street! Although I'm going to blame the bouquet this time. I can't think how it got there, I really can't.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So the bouquet somehow moved from one side of Briar Road to <span style="color:#E16935">the opposite</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm...curious indeed.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Isn't it? ...But the worst of it is, I forgot to pick the bouquet up again when we left the scene! That beautiful rose Roly bought me! With that change from the gutter he spent so long collecting!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... By 'bouquet'... ...do you perhaps mean this sorry, solitary rose?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh! OOOOOOH! Yes! Yes, that's it! That's the bouquet Roly bought me for our anniversary...with old bits of change he found in the gutter!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Maybe just call it a rose.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Tell us, Lord van Zieks, where did you come by the flower?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
According to the report by the police officer in charge of the crime scene investigation... ...it was found on the edge of <span style="color:#E16935">the pavement</span> in front of the Garrideb household.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(In front of the Garridebs' house?)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Although it wasn't noticed until the morning, as it lay where the streetlamps cast no light. It was believed to be of no relevance to the case, since it was found on the opposite side of the thoroughfare.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh, thank you, sir! Thank you! Could I have it back now, please?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... No, I think for good measure, this rose should be added to the Court Record as evidence.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The anniversary bouquet has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
But...it's a symbol of our love... I want it back after the trial! Do you hear me? I want it back!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good grief! Rest, rest assured that I shall do my very best not to forget, Mrs Beate.

'Nothing to report'...?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
That's correct, sah. I had my eyes wide open the entire time. Never looked away for a second. No one else approached the scene, and nothing was removed from it. I can swear to that on the Yard's honour, SAH!

This burnt copy of 'The Lion's Pride' was originally in the Garrideb household. So the question remains, how did it <span style="color:#E16935">find its way</span> into the hand of the victim? Can you shed any light on that, seeing as you were at the scene of the crime the entire time?

Even if that were possible, why would the victim have been gripping a book like that in her hand? As we can see from this photographic print, she had a bag over her shoulder.

...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The fourth book that had no business being at the scene of the crime... ...made me sure that Mrs Garrideb was hiding something from us.

You claim, Constable Beate, there was 'nothing to report' in the fifteen or so minutes you were guarding the scene. But that cannot be.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
.........
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
What...what do you mean to say?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In your testimony just now, Mrs Beate, you explained to the court... ...that when you arrived back at the scene of the crime with the policeman assigned to that beat... ...the bouquet you had dropped at the victim's side was no longer anywhere nearby.

Yes, <span style="color:#E16935">on the opposite side</span> of Briar Road to where the victim was attacked. But considering the size of that meagre 'bouquet' - if a single, sorry bloom can be so described... ...no doubt it was blown in the wind across the street, back into the gutter where it belongs.

Meagre...?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But if that were the case... ...why did Constable Beate not testify to the fact?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
'No one else approached the scene, and nothing was removed from it.' Constable Beate swore to that on Scotland Yard's honour.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
But the bouquet belonged to me! It has nothing to do with the case. That's...that's why Roly didn't mention it, I'm sure!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, because sadly it's not only your bouquet we're talking about here. More than one thing in this case is mysteriously <span style="color:#E16935">the wrong way round</span>!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What are you talking about?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Think about it... Besides Mrs Beate's bouquet...there's Mr Garrideb's book! Mr Garrideb's copy of 'The Lion's Pride', which was thrown out of the window by his wife... ...would have struck the pane of the casement window and landed here, <span style="color:#E16935">on the west side</span> of the street. And yet... ...it was actually found here, <span style="color:#E16935">on the opposite side</span> of the road, in the victim's hand. Meanwhile, according to the testimony we've heard, Mrs Beate's bouquet... ...should have been dropped here, at the scene of the crime, <span style="color:#E16935">on the east end</span> of the street. But in fact... ...it was actually found here, <span style="color:#E16935">on the opposite side</span> of the road, in front of Mr and Mrs Garrideb's house. There's no logical explanation for those things... ...unless somebody <span style="color:#E16935">deliberately moved them</span>!
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
What are you trying to say? The way you're talking, it sounds like you think my Roly's done something wrong!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Don't you listen to a word that scrawny lawyer says! Wittering on about books and bouquets... Why should we care? It's nitpicking, that's what it is!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Oh good. Mrs Garrideb's come round.)</span> You might call it nitpicking, Mrs Garrideb... ...but deliberately meddling with the scene of a crime is a criminal offence. It's called, um...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...'<span style="color:#E16935">Tampering</span>', Mr Naruhodo.

It was five o'clock in the evening and already dark. There was the typical London fog on the ground. When you saw the incident unfold and ran to the victim's aid... ...that was actually on <span style="color:#E16935">the west side</span> of Briar Road.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
No! That's not true! It, it can't have been!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Constable Beate then arranged for you to be absent for a while by sending you for help. And during the fifteen minutes you were away, he <span style="color:#E16935">transplanted</span> the crime scene. He moved all the things shown in this print: the victim herself...the four books... He moved everything in fact...to the pavement on <span style="color:#E16935">the east side</span> of Briar Road!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Extraordinary...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But the constable <span style="color:#E16935">overlooked</span> one thing.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
What? What did he overlook?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The bouquet, I presume?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Exactly.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The prosecution told the court just a few minutes ago about the discovery of the rose bouquet. Lord van Zieks said, 'It wasn't noticed until the morning, as it lay where the streetlamps cast no light.'
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, it couldn't be seen in the dark, obviously.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which is why it was only the bouquet... ...that was found in its original position, on the pavement <span style="color:#E16935">on the west side</span> of Briar Road.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And that...is the defence's theory about what really happened that evening. How do you respond... ...Constable Roly Beate?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
......... Um...well...I'm... Very sorry. I didn't mean to nod off again. But I haven't slept properly...in a month. Did I miss...anything...important...?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh Roly... ...it isn't true, is it? What that lawyer said is all lies, isn't it? I know it is, because you're the most upstanding, righteous man I know!
</p><p>Roly:<br />
......... I had...a dream... A terrible dream... All the thingzzz...I did that night... Everything...come out... Everything...expozzz'd...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Only...it seemzzz... ...it...wasn't a dream at all.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good... GOOD GOLLY! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! What on earth is the meaning of all this?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh Roly, why? Why would you do something like this? Moving a corpse is...is...is a criminal offence, isn't it?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Wishing the victim dead should be one, too.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Constable, explain yourself! Why would you do this? As a respected member of Scotland Yard, your duty is to protect the good people of London town!
</p><p>Roly:<br />
......... I, I can't say...sah.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
WHAAAT?!
</p><p>Roly:<br />
I really am ever so sorry about all this. For damaging the Yard's reputation... For...for everything...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I have a possible explanation.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
For why, on that particular evening... ...Constable Beate felt compelled to move the scene of the crime. I can think of one reason.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?! How could you possibly know? You - a foreigner - presuming to understand the mind of a Scotland Yard policeman!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And yet, Lord van Zieks, it is this foreigner who has uncovered the startling truth of the matter thus far.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I believe it would be beneficial to the court to hear this extraordinary young lawyer's theory. Counsel for the Defence, if you please...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now then...I think you had better show us some evidence.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
At once, My Lord. <span style="color:#0070C0">(England... Japan... It makes no difference where you come from, human emotions are the same. And I think I have a fairly good idea of <span style="color:#E16935">the feelings</span> behind this man's actions...)</span>

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I realise that I'm a foreigner in this land. And I have only just arrived from Japan. Which is why all this information about London's so-called 'bobbies' is completely new to me. I've learnt that, though honourable, 'patrolling the beat is the most demanding work in the world', for example.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Keeping the peace, looking after the citizens on his beat in all kinds of ways... There's no doubt that the young bobby is charged with a great deal to do each day, certainly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But for Constable Beate, the day in question was <span style="color:#E16935">special</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Special? How?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
On account of this <span style="color:#E16935">bouquet</span>, My Lord.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh yes! It was our very first wedding anniversary!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Constable Beate had worked so hard to be able to afford this simple gift for his wife... ...and was so looking forward to taking her out for a celebratory meal...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...When he and Mrs Beate stumbled upon a crime along Briar Road. When he saw that shadowy figure through the fog collapse on the pavement ahead of them... ...what must have gone through the man's mind?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Roly:<br />
But SAH! Just on that one particular day, I was looking forward to celebrating my wedding anniversary. Mrs Beate puts up with a lot being married to a bobby like me. I wanted to show my dear wife how much I care!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Roly:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This is the warrant card that Constable Beate offered to lend to me earlier. Inside, among the rules for patrolling policemen, it says... ...'When a crime is discovered on his beat, a policeman must assist with initial investigations and help detectives.'
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah ha!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Constable Beate... ...is that or is that not the reason why you moved the whole scene of the crime that day?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
......... Yes... Everything you said... It's all right...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... So that's it... It was all to do with <span style="color:#E16935">the boundary of your beat</span>.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Exactly. To summarise... ...the incident actually occurred on Constable Beate's beat.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious! Constable! Do you realise the gravity of what you have done?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
......... It...was the first time since I became a copper... ...that I'd ever cursed God. 'Stay close to me, Pat! The criminal could still be lurking somewhere!'
</p>
<center>As we ran over to the scene, I had every intention of doing my duty as a police officer.</center>
<p>'We've got to report this to the station as quickly as possible!'
</p>
<center>...But then it dawned on me. I realised where we were. <span style="color:#E16935">Where the victim was</span> lying. And what that meant for me.</center>
<p>'When a crime is discovered on his beat, a policeman must assist with initial investigations and help detectives.'
</p>
<center>Why here? Why did this have to happen here? And why tonight of all nights?! ...Why...?</center>
<p>It's a copper's job to guard the scene of the crime, so... ...I told Pat she'd have to go to the nearest police box and fetch whoever was on duty there. It was then, when I opened my mouth to speak... It just...came out. I couldn't believe the words that were coming out of my own mouth! 'This is the next beat to mine, Pat. So you'll have to go <i>[sic]</i> the police box that covers it. Turn right along Meerschaum Street, and then... ............ ........ ......' ......... .........I'm...I'm... I'm sorry... I'm...so sorry...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, Constable...
</p><p>Roly:<br />
I...I just wanted... Just that one night... To take my Patricia out for dinner.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh Roly...
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Just that one night. .........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You knew that if the incident was on your beat, your evening of celebration would be ruined. And so you decided...to move the entire crime scene outside your jurisdiction. Just across the street, to the east pavement of Briar Road... which falls under the neighbouring beat's care.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
......... You see, I... I thought ...Well, I was sure the victim was dead, you see.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I beg your pardon?
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh, of course he did! Otherwise my Roly would never have left the poor woman on the freezing cold pavement!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......... Ah, I see your meaning now.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
......... But God got me back for my sins, didn't He? That's why... That's why I missed the rose I bought for Pat.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Oh no, Roly! That was all my fault! I should never have dropped it in such a dark place... I'm so sorry, Roly!
</p><p>Roly:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... And can you tell us, Constable... ...how many books did you move from the one side of the road to the other in total?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Hm? Oh! ...Um... Four, it was. Yes, sah. ...Definitely...four.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Three of them dropped by Mr Natsume, and the fourth... ...being the one that fell from the window upstairs in the Garrideb household, of course.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...what made you place that book in the victim's hand? When all the others were scattered haphazardly around, I mean.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Oh, well, sah... That's because that's how I found it.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
'How you found it'? What do you mean?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
When we first ran over to the scene... ...the victim was already holding the book. So...when I moved everything, I made sure it was still in her hand.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You're sure it was this book - 'The Lion's Pride' - that the victim was holding?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Oh yes, sah. No doubt about it...sah...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hm...interesting...)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The fourth book's information has been updated in the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Roly:<br />
......... I thought it was an open-and-shut case at the time, you see. There were only the two people at the scene. And Pat and me both saw it happen. However which way you looked at it, it had to be the fellow who ran off who'd done it...I thought. I couldn't see the harm, really. I didn't think moving it all over the road would make a jot of difference. I... I suppose this is it for me now. I've had it...
</p>
<center>.........</center>
<p><br />
Van Zieks:<br />
My Lord...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I believe...that concludes the cross-examination of the witnesses.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Constable...you may withdraw.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Yes, SAH!
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Um, Mr Prosecutor, sir... ...what will become of my Roly? What will happen to him?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... For now, you are free to go home. The police will contact you in due course.
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
Please...don't punish my husband! This, this was all my fault! It's because I'm always moaning at him for coming home late!
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Leave it now, Pat. ...Let's go home. I'm...tired...
</p><p>Patricia:<br />
...Alright then, my love.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
One last thing, Constable...
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Sah?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Let this be a lesson to you. In a criminal investigation, every detail matters, however insignificant it may seem to you.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Yes...sah...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Carve that lesson in your mind. And never again make the mistake of tampering with the scene of a crime.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Ah?! N-Never again, sah? You, you mean to say...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Leave. Now. This trial is not yet over.
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Uh...um... SAAAH!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Well, quite a startling revelation, I must say. Whoever thought of a third party transplanting the entire scene of a crime like that!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Indeed, My Lord. Nevertheless, there are some immutable facts here. Principally... ...that the accused, Mr Soseki Natsume, is the only person who could possibly have committed this crime.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No! I disagree. Now that we know the true scene of the incident...there is someone else. Another person who <span style="color:#E16935">could be responsible</span> for the knife in the victim's back!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Forgive me for being presumptuous... ...but I believe the prosecution is probably well aware of this possibility already.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Lord van Zieks! Is this true?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Very well. Name the person if you will. And if further investigation is warranted... ...the prosecution has no objection to the trial continuing.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
<span style="color:green">You will name this 'other person' who could have perpetrated the crime!</span>

But the situation is very different now! Mrs Garrideb, answer me this...
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
What do you want now, you little toad?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
At the time of the incident, you were engaged in a violent argument with your husband, Mr John Garrideb. In the course of the argument, a minor house fire was ignited... ...and to clear the smoke from the room, your husband opened a window that looks out over Briar Road.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Well, what of it?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You threw this book at your husband, when he was cornered with his back against the window. Upon striking the pane of the open top-hinged casement window, the book plummeted directly down... ...finding its way... ...to what we now know to be the true scene of the incident.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Yes, and as I said, what of it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
During the argument, you were beside yourself with rage. As such, you threw not just books, but anything you could lay your hands on.

So...let me ask you one more time, Mrs Garrideb... This knife - the one removed from the victim's back... Have you really never laid eyes on it before?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Ah... ......... ............ ...I don't recall it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Seriously...?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Am I supposed to remember everything I picked up and threw at my husband? And anyway, the man over there in all that regalia said members of the jury needn't testify, didn't he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Conveniently, yes.

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
No! I have no recollection of saying that at all...juror number four.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Make no mistake... You jurors are not special in any way. You are not immune to the judicial process. If you know something about this knife, madam...let the truth come out.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
But! But that's just a common-or-garden knife! It could have come from anywhere. We have several like that at home. If, if one went missing... ...how would you expect me to know?!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
What's that?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Are you joking?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What are you saying, please, Mrs Garrideb?
</p><p>Now you listen to me!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
I, I refuse to believe all this nonsense! I couldn't bear the thought that I'd injured someone. Do you hear? I couldn't bear it!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, the poor woman...
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
So...yes! I want <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>! I want to see hard evidence if you're going to insist on this being my fault! You're going to have to prove to me that I threw that knife if that's what you think. Come along now! Chop chop! ...Do your worst!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, well...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If, if I had evidence like that, believe me, I would have thrown it at her already!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Then take the stand, juror!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution does not object to the defence's request to cross-examine this woman.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Thank you, Lord van Zieks.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
I... I'm going to have to testify?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Juror number four... ...as I'm sure you will appreciate, having observed it with your own eyes today... ...witness testimony can lead to the most extraordinary truths being unearthed. Truths of which the witnesses themselves may not even have been aware.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Oh dearie me...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So I demand your full and unadulterated testimony, Mrs Garrideb. And mark my words: In this court of law today...we shall extract the truth! Do you concur, Counsels?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Certainly, My Lord.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Um... ...That's what I'm hoping for, My Lord! <span style="color:#0070C0">(This is such a strange feeling... For the first time since arriving in this country, it actually feels real. I'm here, in the Old Bailey...and I'm <span style="color:#E16935">a lawyer</span>!)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
Witness, state your name and occupation.
</p><p>Joan:<br />
Oh...ah... Yes, my name is Joan Garrideb... ...and I'm...um...well... I'm a juror...and suchlike.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It sounds like even she doesn't know if she's a housewife or a maid or what any more...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The court has decided your testimony is required in order to clarify matters in this case. ...Do you understand, madam?
</p><p>Joan:<br />
...Yes! ...My Lord!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You will tell the court everything that took place in your household on the evening in question. And I warn you... Do not attempt to hide the truth.
</p><p>Joan:<br />
Oh... Oh dearie me...
</p><p>???:<br />
...Chin up, Joanie. Nothing to worry about now.
</p><p>Joan:<br />
Oh! I didn't know you were here, John!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Garrideb:<br />
Wasn't only you in the room that day, old thing, was it? Rather think I ought to testify as well, don't you?
</p><p>Joan:<br />
But...but what about your knee, dear?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Don't you worry about that. Hardly notice it! I'm not the sort of chap to leave a comrade to face disciplinary action alone.
</p><p>Joan:<br />
Oh, John...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I presume you are Mr John Garrideb?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Yes, sir! Former second lieutenant of the third regiment of the 4th Northumberland Fusiliers. Sir! Seen my fair share of action and now living the quiet life, as it were.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...The quiet life? Were you not engaged in an incendiary battle with your spouse on the day in question?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Ah...well...yes... Ahem! Quite.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I believe this may represent a first in the proud history of the British court. Calling a juror to the witness stand is unprecedented. However, the court will hear your testimony now, juror number four, and that of your husband. You will recount clearly and concisely the events in your home at the time of the incident in question.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Sir! At once!

<span style="color:#E16935">- The Battle of Garrideb -</span></center>
<p>Garrideb:<br />
Yes, on the day you're referring to, the wife and I did have a bit of a skirmish. Can't recall the reason now.<br />
Knocked a candlestick over and set fire to the carpet! Soon had it out, though, and got the window open.
</p><p>Joan:<br />
Meanwhile...I was picking up whatever I could find to throw at him.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Plenty of knives around our place. Can't say I'd notice if one or two went missing, I'm afraid.<br />
If that bally thing in the victim's back really was one of ours, you'll have a job proving it, I think.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... It sounds as though it was <span style="color:#E16935">quite the battlefield</span> in your household that evening.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Although an entirely <span style="color:#E16935">one-sided</span> assault, it seems.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
The enemy caught us on the hop, sir. Had no choice but to dig in and take defensive measures. To be honest, if the enemy had kept shelling us for another minute, we'd have been toast. 'Course, a veteran such as myself... ...is only too aware that on every battlefield, you're just a gnat's whisker from death at any moment.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Are we still talking about a marital quarrel here?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well... ...I must say I'm dubious that this testimony will shed any light on the origins of this jackknife.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
In combat, one's focus narrows such that surroundings are barely noticed. These witnesses may not be able to offer anything more than they have testified already. This may be a dead end.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Van Zieks may well be right.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, whatever the chances... ...we only have this last cross-examination to uncover <span style="color:#E16935">the truth</span>, Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...I'm afraid so.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, Counsel. Begin your cross-examination!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The reason...is what you told us yesterday, I believe.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, that's right. If I remember correctly... ...it all started because of <span style="color:#E16935">a note</span> that was tucked into the pages of a book belonging to Mr Garrideb.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A rather <span style="color:#E16935">passionate</span> note, in fact. But Mrs Garrideb found the note, discovering her husband's <span style="color:#E16935">little secret</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And she gave him a mighty number of <span style="color:#E16935">slaps</span> across the face for it, too!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...What a sordid state of affairs.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Hell on earth.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
......... I say! When a chap says he can't recall such things, it's common decency not to drag it all up! And besides, half of it was wide of the mark, anyway.
</p><p>Joan:<br />
A likely story!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...These waters run veeery deep.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And what transpired next, after these multiple blows to the face?

And the fire also spread to some items of furniture, didn't it?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
The bookcase...my armchair... Anything of mine, really. Just so happens there was some bathwater around that evening, so I sloshed that about to put it out.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...A most precarious situation you put yourself in.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Ours is a three-storey town house on the west side of the street, where the water main isn't connected yet. Have to draw water from a public water pump during the day if you need any, you see.
</p><p>Joan:<br />
The lodgers are always moaning that they can't get any water at night. Although, that little moustached Japanese man buys water in bottles, I believe.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The defendant, Mr Natsume, you mean?
</p><p>Joan:<br />
Yes. He receives a stipend for his studies, you know. From his home country. Can you imagine? Being able to brew a pot of tea at all hours... He's obviously very well off.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Have you actually seen the state of the man?)</span>

Did your wife's remark just now bring something to mind?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Nothing of any significance, no. Just that the barrage of projectiles the old thing launched in my direction... ...was somewhat more solid than she implies. Books...bricks...and the fire poker, I seem to recall.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Ouch.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />

Your pipe, sir?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Had this thing in my hand as usual at the time of the onslaught. Knocked it clean out with one of her 'soft' projectiles, she did! Yes... And when I went to pick the thing up, it was broken in two. ...I'd like to see a sponge do that sort of damage.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I see, your pipe was broken...
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
It would never have been sent flying unless it was hit by something pretty solid. Anyway, I've managed to bandage the thing up for now.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? ...Would you care to elaborate?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Nothing to say, really. Rather partial to a spot of carving, you see. Pipes and whatnot. Fishing tackle. You know the sort of thing.
</p><p>Joan:<br />
It's a passion we both share. I like to carve little wooden trinkets, too. And then there's my leatherwork.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Sorry to say we're always losing knives about the place. And we have dozens of the things.
</p><p>Joan:<br />
They sell them at the market, sometimes. Twenty for the price of nineteen. Needless to say, I snap them up! John prefers to use two knives at meal times too, instead of a knife and fork.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Now now, Joan, we don't want people thinking I'm some kind of savag- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Here we go again with the scaldings. Why are they being so evasive?)</span>

...But I can't see anything.

There are already countries in the world where these so-called fingerprints can be used as evidence. Lord Stronghart is currently discussing the matter at the Ministry of Justice.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, I believe we are rapidly approaching an era of scientific methods of investigation.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But for now...we shall have to find an alternative method of proving our assertion. That this knife found in the victim's back was originally in Mr and Mrs Garrideb's house.

Ugh... If only I could transplant this whole incident to several years in the future...

What is that? A tiny scrap of metal?

Yes. Almost certainly from the tip of a blade. And what may appear at first to be just a tiny scrap...is in fact a crucial piece of evidence!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Interesting. And where did the defence come by this evidence?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was lodged in the chamber of Mr Garrideb's pipe.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
My pipe, you say? By Jove, I wonder how that got there.

And what precisely does this fragment of metal signify, Counsel? Are you suggesting that it is in some way related to the matter of the stabbing on Briar Road?

Yes, My Lord! The crucial point we have to ask ourselves here... ...is <span style="color:#E16935">when</span> did the fragment of metal find its way inside Mr Garrideb's pipe?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Something that was clarified for us in the most recent witness testimony.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Garrideb:<br />
Had this thing in my hand as usual at the time of the onslaught. Knocked it clean out with one of her 'soft' projectiles, she did! Yes... It would never have been sent flying unless it was hit by something pretty solid.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Garrideb:<br />
Oh...dearie...me...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
During the argument between these two that occurred just as the victim was on the pavement below... ...Mrs Garrideb flung this knife at her husband. However... ...the knife missed Mr Garrideb, instead striking the pipe in his hand at the time.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Which caused the tip to <span style="color:#E16935">break off</span>... Of course.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good Lord!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. And that is when the tiny tip of the blade... ...found its way inside Mr Garrideb's pipe!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
The...the chances of that are a million to one!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And yet there's no other credible explanation for how the tip of the blade ended up in your pipe. Then, after losing its tip, the knife ricocheted off the pipe and flew out of <span style="color:#E16935">the open window</span>.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In short! This knife, which <span style="color:#E16935">fell</span> from the window of the Garridebs' house... ...is the very same knife that struck the victim in the middle of the back on the street below!

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...A full-bodied theory, I'll give you that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
A complex bouquet of seemingly trivial points, plausibly arranged to create an almost passable vintage. Allow me to toast my learned friend's characteristically Nipponese approach to <span style="color:#E16935">bottling his argument</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But after all, it is just a theory. The bottle, I fear, is corked. Because you see... ...it's spoilt by an insurmountable inconsistency!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
An insurmountable... ...WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT??!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Lord van Zieks! Explain yourself! What is this inconsistency you claim to have identified?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
An inconsistency of the simplest nature, My Lord. The victim was found with the knife planted <span style="color:#E16935">in the middle of her back</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes, in her- Ah!
</p><p>Joan:<br />
That's right! You silly little man!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Now, Joan old thing... What are you getting so excited about?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Let us consider the basic facts of the case once more. The victim was walking along the pavement before being stabbed in the back and falling to the ground. If the knife that struck her had fallen <span style="color:#E16935">from above</span>... ...there's no possible way it could have planted itself into <span style="color:#E16935">the victim's back</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar!
</p><p>Joan:<br />
Quite right! You see! That's exactly right! If the knife had fallen on her from above... ...it would have struck her <span style="color:#E16935">on the top of her head</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...um... .........
</p>
<center>He's lost for words, look...<br />
I knew it... I never liked his theory in the first place.<br />I don't know, though... What really did happen?</center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
Hmmm... It would appear the defence has made rather a spectacular blunder.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If a theory has even one inconsistency...it cannot stand. Your theory, my learned friend...is history!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(We were so close... I could see the truth... I was so sure we were on the right track... But now the way has been blocked completely...by just one, simple <span style="color:#E16935">inconsistency</span>!)</span>
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>Or in other words...</center>
<p><br />
Susato:<br />
...we simply need to eliminate that one inconsistency, and the theory will stand!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Miss Susato!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You mustn't worry, Mr Naruhodo. You were just caught off guard, that's all. And your mind went blank. But if the path you were on is indeed correct, then a way will present itself. The key to this is in the Court Record, I'm sure. All <span style="color:#E16935">the information</span> you need is there!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It seems you have nothing to say, my Nipponese friend. Well, your silence speaks volumes. A tacit acceptance that your theory...is fatally flawed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This inconsistency doesn't mean I was on the wrong track... It means that I need to sharpen my mind and dig deeper for the truth! It's <span style="color:#E16935">a test</span>!)</span> Yes! If the knife fell on the victim from above, there's no way that it could have hit her in the middle of her back... ...under normal circumstances, that is.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What are you implying?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There is a piece of evidence in the Court Record that can explain this inconsistency. That can explain how the knife that fell from above could have pierced <span style="color:#E16935">the victim's back</span>. We already have the answer.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Goodness!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Utter...utter madness!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Surely this must be the last time... Counsel, present the evidence of which you speak!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is the last inconsistency... The final piece in the puzzle. If I can successfully make sense of this...the truth will be laid bare at last!)</span> <span style="color:green">The evidence that explains how the falling knife became lodged in the victim's back is...</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This is the final piece of evidence the defence will present!
</p><p>.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That answer appeared to make Mr Garrideb rather lightheaded. But Mrs Garrideb didn't bat an eyelid.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It would seem...you've been cut down in your prime.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Uh-oh...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You must watch out for blades falling from the heavens, my learned friend. They may strike at any time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
AAAAAAGH! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Not what you want to hear...from the Reaper! If the knife fell straight down and hit the victim in the middle of her back... ...then her back must have been facing the heavens at the time. But why?

</p><p><i>Leads back to:</i><br />
"Surely this must be the last time..."
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This - <span style="color:#E16935">the fourth book</span> found at the scene... This is the final piece of evidence the defence will present!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The burnt book?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Is that not Mr Garrideb's book?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. And to understand its significance, we have to consider <span style="color:#E16935">how it came to be</span> at the scene in the first place. This photographic print clearly shows the book in question... ...and the victim <span style="color:#E16935">holding it</span> in her hand.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But as we all now know... ...it was the police constable that <span style="color:#E16935">put the book between her fingers</span> like that.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Quite so. As part of his wholesale transplanting of the crime scene to the opposite side of the road.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's true. However... ...as part of his testimony, Constable Beate made an extremely enlightening statement on that point.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...what made you place that book in the victim's hand?
</p><p>Roly:<br />
Oh, well, sah... That's because that's how I found it. When we first ran over to the scene... ...the victim was already holding the book. So...when I moved everything, I made sure it was still in her hand.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In other words, the victim had <span style="color:#E16935">already picked the book up</span> of her own volition. And clearly, that must have been <span style="color:#E16935">before</span> she suffered the knife wound.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, I should say so! After being attacked with a knife, I don't imagine she'd have been doing much of anything.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So the question becomes...why did the victim have that book in her hand?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
By...by jingo! I...think I'm beginning to see what may have happened now.
</p><p>Joan:<br />
Oh dearie me...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... We know that the book fell from the top floor of the Garrideb household onto the pavement below. At precisely the moment that the victim was walking past.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, at exactly that moment. The young woman was walking along the street in the light fog... ...when all of a sudden, a book fell right in front of her.
</p><p>Joan:<br />
...The book I threw...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, Mrs Garrideb. And what do you think the woman did? What would you do, if you were walking along and suddenly a book landed in front of you on the pavement?
</p><p>Joan:<br />Well, I... I really can't imagine it... But...I suppose... ...she might have reached down...
</p>
<center>...and picked the book up.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! That is exactly what the woman in fact did. She <span style="color:#E16935">picked up the book</span>!
</p><p>Joan:<br />
Oh... Oh heavens! 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And when the woman reached down to <span style="color:#E16935">pick the fallen book up</span>... ...what position would <span style="color:#E16935">her back</span> have been in? That's right. Facing the sky, completely and utterly defenceless. Then, in the very next moment, while the woman was still bent over picking up the book... ...the next object fell from the room above - the jackknife - straight into the middle of her back. And at that same time... ...walking by chance directly behind Miss Green... ...was the defendant, Mr Soseki Natsume.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well I never!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It appeared to Mr Natsume... ...that the woman simply collapsed on the floor. In the dark and the fog, <span style="color:#E16935">he didn't see</span> the knife falling on her from above.
</p><p>Joan:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...And from the other direction... ...the constable and his wife saw no one but the victim and her apparent attacker.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So <span style="color:#E16935">there never was</span> a 'real culprit' to run from the scene in the first place...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No. This was nothing more than a series of unlikely events that culminated in an unfortunate accident. And THAT is the real truth behind this case! Well...Mr and Mrs Garrideb?
</p>
<center>.........</center>
<p><br />
Joan:<br />
The very first time you showed me that knife, I... I had my suspicions. I wondered if perhaps it might have been something like that.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
There there, old bean...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Poor Mrs Garrideb... 
</p><p>Joan:<br />
...Of course I never meant for anything of the sort to happen, but... ...it was all my fault...wasn't it?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
.........
</p><p>Joan:<br />
I take full responsibility. I let my anger get the better of me. ...I threw that book. ...And I threw the knife as well.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........
</p><p>Joan:<br />
John, dear...
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
It's alright. I know.
</p><p>Joan:<br />I'm... I'm ever so sorry. Truly.........
</p>
<center>I'M SORRIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEE!!!</center>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Lord van Zieks...what news of Mrs Garrideb?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
She's been taken to the infirmary. It would appear that today's events had left her in an especially flustered state. However, I believe she will recover in due course. There is no cause for concern.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, unbeknownst to themselves, they caused what could easily have been a terrible tragedy. They shall have to prepare themselves for the consequences of their actions.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
There is some good news, however, My Lord. I have just had word from the hospital where the victim is being treated. Her condition is improving steadily, and the doctor believes she will regain consciousness soon.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's strange, we've been talking about the victim all this time, but we've never once met her.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
How wonderful! The woman is out of danger, it seems.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, that is good news.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, Mr Soseki Natsume...
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Ah...um... Yes!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
On behalf of my fellow countrymen, I would like to take this opportunity to beg your pardon, sir. You came from your distant Eastern homeland to study our great British culture... ...and have been repaid with immeasurable unkindness. Please accept our heartfelt apologies.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
......... No, it is me who should be begging your pardon.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh no, Mr Natsume...
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
That evening...when the young woman just collapsed on the pavement before my eyes... ...I, I jumped to the wrong conclusion again, in my confusion.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What conclusion, sir?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
I was sure that the woman was dead.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, Constable Beate said the same thing, didn't he? He thought she had been killed, too.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I suppose she must have looked completely lifeless.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
......... It's been about a year since I arrived in Great Britain now. But I still can't get used to life here. I, I can't relax. I'm sure there are evil spirits lurking in the fog... Like they're haunting me!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Poor Soseki-san... His imagination really has got the better of him.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, poor man...
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
So when it happened... ...I thought the young woman had been taken by the fog spirits! I should never have dropped my books like that and run away. I SHOULD HAVE CALLED FOR HELP! FOR A DOCTOR! FOR THE POLICE! ......... Instead, I've managed to create a rift in the relationship of trust between our two empires. And for that...I am truly sorry.
</p>
<center>.........</center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
One could indeed say that some sort of mischievous spirit has been at work here, I think. One that created a chain of unfortunate mishaps. We were befooled by this spirit and led to false conclusions. But thanks to Lord van Zieks, and our young lawyer here from the East... ...that chain has now been broken, and the spirit exorcised. ...I heartily commend you both.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now then, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Yes, My Lord!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In concluding this trial, I must ask one last time for your decisions regarding the defendant's culpability. Are you ready to present your findings to the court?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
As the foreman of the jury, I can assure you we've reached a fair and just conclusion.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
I do declare the truth can be extremely cruel at times.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Well, I didn't suspect the woman next to me, that's for sure!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Sitting in for the old bean whilst she's out of action, you know. But I know what her decision would be.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Does this mean I'll finally be able to get out of here and start work? ...Well, it's about time!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I say, I'll have a corker of a story to tell the grandchildren when I get home, won't I?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I hereby demand your final decisions. Mr Foreman!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Not guilty!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Not guilty!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Not guilty!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Not guilty!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Not guilty!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Not guilty!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. Mr Soseki Natsume... I hereby pronounce you...
</p>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
And finally, Mr Natsume...
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Oh! Yes, Lord, sir?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You are now a free man once more. It is my hope that you will continue to further your education in British culture. ...And may you never again be brought before me!
</p><p>Soseki:<br />Oh, oh yes, sir. Of course! On my life...I SWEAR I'LL NEVER SET FOOT IN A COURTROOM AGAIN! I'm...
</p>
<center>Transported To Tears!</center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
Thank you, Counsels. Court is adjourned!

<center><span style="color:green">20th February, 3:17 p.m.<br />
The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber</span></center>
<p><br />
Soseki:<br />
Oh, Locum!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Wait. You, you mean me?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
OF COURSE! Is there another locum here?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Is there even one?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Compared to the original 'Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire', your name has become rather short, hasn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...What's wrong with using my actual name?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />Oh, at last! I'm free! I'm free!
</p>
<center>Joyful, Joyous, Jubilant Jubilation!<br />Heady Hearty Happiness, Hurrah!</center>
<p><br />
Susato:<br />
Oh, I am pleased! Mr Natsume is delighted!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Would it be so hard just to say that, then?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Locum, you did it! You saved me from the brink!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, what happened to the poor woman was in no way your fault, after all. I'm just glad everyone can see that now.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />NO NO NO! NOT THAT!
</p>
<center>Lovely Loyal Locum Lawyer!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...yes?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
......... I mean, as I said before...I have just never got used to life here in Great Britain. Every time I look over my shoulder, I see foreigners. I see towering brick buildings. And from high-up windows, I see them looking down on me, laughing, 'Look at that little hunchback!'
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear, I'm sure it's all in your head, Mr Natsume.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />...But! Today! You, locum lawyer, gave my gloom the boot! You stood firm behind that baronial bench, before all those babbling British! You battled to the bitter end, laying bare the baffling truth! And when I beheld the blinding fireworks among the beams of the Bailey's roof, I bellowed:
</p>
<center>Behold the Best Barrister ever Born!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, that's very flattering. And we're very pleased for you.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
This has given me a wonderful anecdote to recount to my old friends back in Japan.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
An, an anecdote? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Is that what's to become of all my hard work?)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
Ah, there you are, my dear fellows!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I apologise for keeping you waiting. I rose late this morning.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, Mr Sholmes! What a pleasure to see you!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I see I am here not a moment too soon. A disaster has been averted, I'm glad to say!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The trial shall begin presently, Mr Naruhodo. And I wish you the very best of luck.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...It's just finished.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
What?! No! Then my haste was in vain?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
AAAAAARGH!!! It's...! It's...YOU! HERR LOCK SHOLMES!!!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh? Have we met, sir?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Um, this is Mr Natsume. The man you had arrested, Mr Sholmes.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, I see. I failed to recognise you at first. Our previous encounters have taken place in the gloom. Either of your bleak lodgings or that prison cell. I simply couldn't place that curious face, in the light.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Charming.)</span>
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
This is all your fault...Herr Lock Sholmes! You're the reason I had to go through this terrible ordeal! I'm...I'm going to give you...a piece of my mind!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
My apologies, sir, but I assure you, I have placed you now. You're the fellow who abandoned that poor young lady and ran off, are you not?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Ah.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Had she been taken to hospital more urgently... ...I feel perhaps she would have regained consciousness by now.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Oh.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But it was unavoidable, I'm sure. We are but human, after all. Anyone would have been shaken by such an experience.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
......... I...do feel very badly about how I behaved.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, never mind. Now then, what was it that you wanted to say to me, sir?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
......... Nothing.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Priceless! Oh, I am sorry, really, but... ...that was quite priceless.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Poor Soseki-san...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Still, on the bright side, you've had an extremely entertaining experience without paying a penny! And, it would seem...you were not even found guilty.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
...But there is no bright side.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Whatever do you mean, Mr Natsume?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Even after this, I'm... I'm still cursed! ...By the spirits. And... AND NOW BY THE REAPER!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Lord van Zieks...)</span>
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
I haven't forgotten, you know! What facing that man in court means! Even if you're found not guilty...YOU'RE STILL DOOMED!!!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It, it will all be alright, Mr Natsume.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
If the Reaper appears trying to make trouble... ...I will protect you!
</p>
<center>Haiiiiii-YA!</center>
<p>...With a perfectly executed Susato Takedown!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Much as I like being turned on my head, a bit of warning might be nice next time, Miss Susato. So, Mr Natsume...what do you intend to do now? You mentioned something about recounting your experiences to your friends back in Japan?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
......... Yes! I, I intend to return to my homeland soon.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
It has already been a year since I arrived here in Great Britain. I've visited universities, libraries, bookshops... I've been honoured with the tutelage of professors... I've learnt so much about the wealth of literature here, and the city it has shaped. And I've come to realise that it is my calling to sail home and tell my fellow countrymen about it.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's very touching, Mr Natsume.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...Or, in perhaps less veiled terms... ...you wish to withdraw halfway around the world to escape the terror of the Reaper's curse?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL! The more I learn of literature, the more this strange feeling claws at my insides. I feel compelled to return to my roots and attempt to pen a work of my own.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, I see. <span style="color:#0070C0">(A work of literature by Soseki-san... Could be an interesting read.)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And what about Miss Susato and yourself, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? What about us?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Will you return to Japan alongside your moustached compatriot?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Why would we?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
A week has not yet passed since we arrived in London. And only now does it feel as though we have finally found our feet!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And...you are accommodated in a hotel at present, are you not?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right. But we need to find lodgings before it bankrupts us.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I've calculated we can only afford another ten nights before our entire budget is exhausted.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Well then! You could take my lodgings.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! ...The...windowless room?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Ah, but what it lacks in windows, it more than makes up for with a floor, a ceiling AND walls.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Great.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
And of course, I'd be happy to leave behind the accursed evil spirit!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my! An evil spirit?!
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Oh yes. It tries to suffocate you while you sleep. It's, it's...an infallible wake-up call!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We'll...think about it, if that's alright.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Perhaps I can offer a more welcome alternative. Would you consider taking lodgings with me?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Really?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, a vacancy has conveniently presented itself. ...Though it is up in the attic, I might add.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Are you sure it isn't just a storage loft?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I spoke with the landlady this very morning on the matter of price. And Iris is cleaning the room as we speak. You must come at once. ...I presume you have no luggage to speak of?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, this is simply wonderful! What an honour! To be invited to taking lodgings in the great detective's office...'s attic! I'm...I'm too overcome for words!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...So suggesting we look elsewhere is out then.)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Then it's settled. Iris will prepare a welcome dinner this evening. And you must come too, Mr Natsume. I insist!
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
I...I...I...don't know what to say! But thank you! And yes!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Wonderful! Then I'll go and complete the paperwork for your formal release, Mr Natsume! It shan't take long!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Somebody's happy.)</span>
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
...Locum. I, I knew that you wouldn't let me down. I'm truly delighted to have met you here in London.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Likewise, Mr Natsume. It's been a privilege meeting you, too. It's a shame that we're going to have to say goodbye so soon.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Well...I've come to realise that I belong in Japan. But, Locum! We'll meet again one day.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I'm sure. <span style="color:#0070C0">(And hopefully by then, I'll be a successful lawyer.)</span>
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Hopefully by then, I'll be a successful author.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, my dear fellow, our carriage appears to have arrived. Shall we go, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, Mr Sholmes.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I've little doubt Mr Natsume will be released in time for dinner this evening.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>And so... ...with Soseki-san's innocence successfully established... ...we rode with Mr Sholmes to what was to become our new home: 221B Baker Street.</center>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">20th February, 4:41 pm.<br />
The Attic Room</span></center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
So this...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Is to be our new office, yes!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Our office...? I rather like the sound of that.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Me, too! It's simply wonderful, isn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I hope you can see this, Kazuma. It's only a small step... ...but I'd like to think we're getting a little closer to your dream now.)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So, my dear fellows! Do you like the place?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, Mr Sholmes... Yes, thank you so much.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's a delightful room, Mr Sholmes! I simply adore it!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Good, I'm pleased to hear it. Iris and I are delighted to welcome you.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I hope everyone's hungry! It's nearly time for dinner. We'll eat as soon as Mr Natsume arrives. We have a lot to celebrate!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Iris, you must let me help you!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Alright then, Susie, you can be in charge of the salad.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Splendid!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So, Mr Naruhodo, how does it feel? To have your own office in the capital?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's very exciting, actually. I can't help wondering what adventures await us.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Those were precisely my sentiments when I first established my office at these premises. ...Until I discovered the dark truth about the city of London, that is.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
London is a glorious place, full of wonder, opportunity, prosperity and mirth. But the brightest of lights... ...casts the darkest of shadows.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Shadows? What do you mean?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, I believe you're well aware of the murkiness that lies behind London's facade already. So once again, Mr Naruhodo... ...welcome to London!
</p>
<hr />
<center>Of course, at the time... ...I had no idea of the significance of those words Mr Sholmes so casually spoke. But it wasn't long before my turn came... ...to lift the facade and see the true depth of the murk that lay behind it.</center>

Juror number two.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Oh! ...Yes?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Do you have something to say about that last statement?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
What I am particularly troubled by... ...is this mole. No amount of powder seems to cover it up!

...Perhaps you could give the trial as much attention as your mole?

Erm, no, not really. Rather like how the accused wouldn't have had a reason to take the long way home from the bookshop.

...That wasn't even slightly what I asked.
