<i>Anime cutscene</i><br />
'I begin to think, Wilson,' said Sholmes, turning his head languidly in my direction, 'that there is more to this case than that which we have observed. Indeed, that there may be another part to this story that we are yet to discover.' His eyes wandered, following the steam rising from his cup of herbal tea, leading him to the distant memory of that snowy evening - to the young lady, collapsed on the pavement along Briar Road, and to the knife in her back. Lit in the soft glow of gas lamps, a most extraordinary scene had been set, and under the cover of a light fog, the curtain had risen silently on the insoluble mystery of our invisible killer.

These are the Scales of Justice. They're a symbol of the defence, aren't they?

Yes, that's right. The scales are a symbol of fairness, to show that all are treated equally in the eyes of the law. And they're a warning to those who enter the courtroom without an impartial mind. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But if they're the mark of the defence... ...it would be more auspicious if they were weighing more heavily on the 'not guilty' side, I think.

<p>Susato:<br />
Did you sleep last night, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No...not at all.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It was an enormous hotel, wasn't it? The rooms were so luxurious! I felt like we were staying in a palace! And with all the gas lights twinkling, it was brighter than day even in the middle of the night!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What about the enormous beds? After my time on the SS Burya, I wasn't going to waste a single inch of that space. I spent the entire night rolling from one side of the mattress to the other.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh yes, it really was the sort of night you can only dream of normally. Except... ...when I learnt that we owed three pounds for the rooms, that dream quickly turned into a nightmare.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oops! ...Sorry about that. The building was so impressive, and the entrance so inviting, I just...wandered in without thinking.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
In a lodging house in Japan, that sum of money would put a roof over your head for a whole year. I did try, but...I'm afraid I couldn't help my tears when we were presented with the bill.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... I really am sorry...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, never mind. We must find some more affordable lodgings straight away, though. If we're not careful, our entire stipend will be used up in ten days or less.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... London is a scary place...
</p>
<center>Ah, good morning to you at this early hour.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Yes! Um...we...erm... Well!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Good morning to you, Lord Chief Justice. We have come to report on the outcome of the trial at the Old Bailey yesterday.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Susato-san is amazing. She doesn't bat an eyelid, even in the presence of the imposing Lord Stronghart.)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Yes, I believe you had a very comprehensive initiation into British courtroom practices.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...yes! It was very...eye-opening, thank you!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And...in accordance with your instructions, Lord Stronghart... ...Mr Naruhodo performed his duty to the end.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Yes...I've already been apprised of events. You conducted a remarkable defence. ...You may consider the test passed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
No longer are you a student from the Empire of Japan... You may henceforth claim to be...a fully fledged <span style="color:#E16935">lawyer</span>! My country is delighted to welcome young talent from such a remote Eastern land.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...thank you very much! <span style="color:#0070C0">(So...I'm a lawyer now...)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Now, in view of your new appointment, I have a fresh case in mind for you. I'd like you to take it on at once. ...I trust that won't be a problem?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Another case? Already?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Nothing trains a lawyer better than practical experience. ...I'm sure I don't sense dissatisfaction, do I?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... It's just that yesterday's trial ended...unusually. I haven't quite come to terms with it.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
What's to <span style="color:#E16935">come to terms with</span>? The man was cleared. ...What more were you hoping for?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
The culpability of the defendant has not, at the present time, been established by this court. Consequently... ...the jury will not be required to proffer judgement.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Well, Lord van Zieks...it's been a pleasure, so it has. And as for you, my dear fella...I couldn't have asked for a better defence!
</p><p>Wah hah hah hah hah!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I just can't help wondering... if Mr McGilded really was <span style="color:#E16935">innocent</span>?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's just that I never managed to ascertain the truth. And then the trial ended.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... Well, you needn't let it trouble you for a second longer.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What do you mean, Lord Stronghart?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Magnus McGilded passed away. Immediately following the trial.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! Mr... Mr McGilded is... ...<span style="color:#E16935">dead</span>?!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I have nineteen minutes and forty-one seconds until my next engagement. ...Time enough to talk.

I don't understand! What happened?! How can he be dead?

After the trial concluded yesterday, there was a great commotion in the Old Bailey. As you'll presumably recall, an omnibus had been wheeled into the courtroom.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, of course. That was the scene of the crime which Mr McGilded had been accused of.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Precisely. Well, while the bailiff's attention was diverted by some other matter, the omnibus went up in flames.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
How could such a thing have happened?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
That is being investigated as we speak. But already... ...the police have identified a corpse found inside the charred shell of the carriage as that of McGilded.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's awful!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The man must have slipped inside whilst the bailiff's attention was elsewhere.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...That bailiff really needs to pay more attention.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And how could THAT have happened?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
That is also being investigated as we speak.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Thinking back now... ...immediately after the trial, Mr McGilded did mention going back into the courtroom to look at the omnibus.
</p>
<hr />
<p>McGilded:<br />
Well, I must be makin' tracks now. 'Tis time for the inspection.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? What inspection? 
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
They're goin' to examine the omnibus again, so I'm told. I asked if I could be present for it meself.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Stronghart:<br />
An inspection of the omnibus? Not to my knowledge. I don't believe Scotland Yard had any intention of re-examining the carriage.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But... Then who was Mr McGilded talking about?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Never mind that now. The Yard is making a thorough investigation. This matter is no longer any concern of yours. Leave it to the police.

I don't mean to be contrary, Lord Stronghart, but... the case was anything but simple!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />

The circumstances of the case were so incriminating, I was stunned when I first heard them. In fact, I'm still finding it hard to believe that we managed to get a favourable verdict.

......... Heh heh heh...

Is, is something funny?

No no, my apologies. However, the fact is that you did receive the not guilty verdict you set out to achieve.

And that can only be attributed to exceptional talent... wouldn't you agree?

Oh, Mr Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't know if I could face standing in that courtroom again after Mr McGilded's trial.)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Ah yes, I nearly forgot... There is <span style="color:#E16935">one similarity</span> with yesterday's case. Once again, there is currently no one to advocate for the defence.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
If the situation remains unchanged, the trial will start tomorrow with the defendant unrepresented. And if that happens, I need not remind you of the inevitable outcome.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">The most terrible end</span> awaits the defendant...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Yes...that's right.

</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...Your time is up. You will have to excuse me. I would advise you to begin making preparations for tomorrow's trial. After all, the clock is ever ticking. There is now but twenty-three hours, twenty-six minutes and thirty-nine seconds until the court sits.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Last time he mentioned the twenty-three hours, he said there was <span style="color:#E16935">plenty of time</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
And one more thing...Mr Naruhodo... There is something I should like to ask you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Um...what's that?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Yesterday, you remarked upon something... That you intend to see through <span style="color:#E16935">the will</span> of your late compatriot, Mr Asogi.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I would be interested to hear what exactly you mean by that... ...inside thirty-four seconds.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, well, erm... Kazuma always used to say, you see... ...that he wanted to learn how the greatest justice system in the world worked so he could change ours in Japan. Now that he's gone, I'd like to work towards that myself. ...And...there's another thing...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
'<span style="color:#E16935">Another thing</span>'? Continue...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
On the way here, on the steamship, he said something to me...
</p>
<hr />
<center>There's something very important that I have to do.</center>
<hr />
<p>Stronghart:<br />
'<span style="color:#E16935">Something very important</span>'? And what, exactly, would that be?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He...never had a chance to tell me. I suppose he would have done...if he'd ever made it to Great Britain.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...You're out of time. Well, thank you for an enlightening discussion.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo! What's all this about?! Mr Asogi never once mentioned anything of the sort to me!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I urge you both to focus your attentions on the matter at hand. I've taken the liberty of summoning the police inspector in charge of the case. He'll be able to apprise you of the details.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(How long has he been there?)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
So...I wish you the best of luck...and bid you farewell.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... 'There's something very important that I have to do.' Kazuma-sama... What did you mean...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I wish I knew. But honestly, he never told me. ...Anyway, we had better talk to the detective, don't you think?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, you're right!

You're acting like you know this man, Miss Susato. But he's a London detective.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, I do know him! Very well, in fact!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Very well?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes! He features prominently in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, in that publication. What's it called again? Randst Magazine?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's right. Inspector Gregson and Mr Sholmes enjoy a wonderful <span style="color:#E16935">friendly rivalry</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Really? YOU rival the great Mr Sholmes? That's incredible!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Oh, um...well, I don't know about that... Mr Sholmes isn't a professional like myself, of course. But he does come up with the goods from time to time.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Sholmes is equally complimentary about you, Inspector, isn't he? You've earnt his highest praise! 'Gregson is the pick of a bad lot of all the Scotland Yarders!' Those were his own words!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That's his highest praise?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, Mr Sholmes isn't particularly known for giving compliments, you see.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That he is not! And thanks to that magazine, my name's known all over London town now!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's great, isn't it?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Hmph. I have to admit that to start with I was a little... well, flattered by all the attention. Everyone wanted to shake my hand, and my reputation at the Yard went through the roof.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well that's wonderful!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
No it is NOT! There's nothin' more sinister than the man on the street! People are always lookin' at me now. They're whisperin' rumours about me under their breath, I'm sure.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Rumours?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Are, are you quite sure?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
'He's changed since he started appearin' in those stories... The fame's gone to his head.' Stuff like that.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Gosh, do you really think people are saying such mean-spirited things about you?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
...Like I said, they whisper! So I can't catch exactly what they're sayin'. But I know what folk are like. I'm sure that's what they're sayin'! As sure as eggs is eggs!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........

Oh dear... Perhaps a sudden rise to fame does change people...

So, um...about <span style="color:#E16935">the case</span> that the Lord Chief Justice mentioned before...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Nothin' to tell, really. As far as we're concerned at the Yard, it couldn't be simpler.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear. That probably means... ...that as far as we're concerned as lawyers, it couldn't be more complicated.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I wish you were wrong about that, but I have a nasty feeling you're right.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
A young woman was walkin' along the pavement on Briar Road when she was stabbed from behind. Fortunately, it wasn't fatal, but she's still laid up in hospital, unconscious.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's despicable! What sort of coward would attack the poor woman from behind!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I suppose you would have finished whoever it was off with a Susato Takedown, would you?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That is neither here nor there, Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Brace yourself, Ryunosuke! You've angered her now!)</span>
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Anyway, after somethin' of a whirlwind investigation, the criminal was arrested. He barely had time for a cup of tea after the incident took place, to be honest.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...there must have been something left at the scene that led you directly to the culprit?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Or perhaps a reliable witness who recognised the person in question?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Let me stop you right there. ...You're wastin' your time on this one.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
There's nothin' you can do. There's <span style="color:#E16935">no way</span> to help the bloke now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Why ever not?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Simple... The prosecutor that's been assigned to the trial tomorrow...is Lord Barok van Zieks.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Sounds like you've heard of him then.

Oh yes, we are very familiar with Lord van Zieks. Believed to be the harbinger of death itself...

</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, if that's the case, we should inform you, Inspector... ...that in yesterday's trial against Lord van Zieks... Mr Naruhodo secured a verdict of not guilty!

Haah... And what of it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! Well, um, I think... ...that means that even against the Reaper of the Bailey, it's not impossible to save the defendant!

Ah!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Magnus McGilded came a cropper in that omnibus when it went up in flames. So you can't rightly say you <span style="color:#E16935">saved</span> the defendant, can you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What...what are you saying?!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Look, if van Zieks could get the dirt to stick on everyone, he'd be a miracle-worker. But that's not how it goes. He doesn't work miracles; he works magic...<span style="color:#E16935">black magic</span>. I'd have a good, long think about that, if I were you.

...Right, well, I've filled you in as requested, and I'm very nearly out of chips... So I'll be headin' back to the crime scene now. We're still carryin' out a few investigations there.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It was <span style="color:#E16935">Briar Road</span>, you said, didn't you? Where the incident took place.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That's correct, ma'am. And if you head over to the holding cells you can meet the criminal himself.

You've branded him a criminal already?

He's as good as. Shakin' like a leaf in his cell, he is. ...It'll give you a chuckle if nothin' else. He's inmate fifty-three. Speak to the jailer and he'll show you the way.

To tell the truth, when I recall the trial yesterday, I can't stop myself from shaking. The idea of facing the Reaper in court again is... Well, if you think it's too much for you, there's no shame in turning the case down. That takes courage, too.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

So...

If I'm honest, I'm still reeling from the shock of yesterday's events myself. And I'm really not sure if I'll be able to help this man, whoever he is. But I'd like to try. So I think I'm going to make some enquiries. ...Will you help?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
'<span style="color:#E16935">Suffer that misery</span>'? Did you not want to study here?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
No! I mean, I've had an interest in Great Britain for some years, of course.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Oh.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
But! Just because the government tells you to do something, does it mean you CAN do it? No!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
If they'd told me to study <span style="color:#E16935">English literature</span>, THAT I could have understood. That's my field. But no, they told me to study <span style="color:#E16935">the English language</span>!

<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Sure the bookshop wasn't accursed, too?)</span>

They'll, they'll say it was shameful, I know. To run away like that...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Tell me, Soseki-san, was the victim an acquaintance of yours?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Don't be ridiculous! Do you think I know nay of these fair-haired English?! And a young woman at that! I'm diffident! Shy! Timid! Unsure! I can't TALK to people!

</p><p>Susato:<br />
He didn't touch the victim, and there was nobody at the scene to see him. So how did the police ever discover that he was there in the first place?

It was the morning after that nightmare had unfolded on the pavement before me. I was gnawing on a sliver of hard cheese when some men suddenly burst in through the door. They started shouting at me! 'This is the police! Put <span style="color:#E16935">the weapon</span> down!' Yes, it was a thin sliver, and yes it was hard... But I wasn't eating a weapon!

Good point, good point. But my mind went blank. I, I knew I had to answer, but I didn't know what to say. So I just kept repeating things like, 'Yes, I do!' and 'I'm fine!' The next thing I knew, I was in manacles. And before I knew it, I was thrown in here.

Well, erm...

Why?! WHY?! Why is it so hard to say 'yes' to me?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, the thing is...I'm just a student like yourself. On a study tour.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
A, a student...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I have defended a case in the Old Bailey. Only the one, though. But at this moment in time, I really don't know what I'm supposed to believe in. I'm...confused about what justice in this country even means.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, Naruhodo-san...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm not even the foreign student who was supposed to be here. I'm...a sort of <span style="color:#E16935">locum</span> lawyer, I suppose.

But! But that armband! That's <span style="color:#E16935">the mark</span> of a defence lawyer from our great empire!

</p><p>Soseki:<br />
A, a keepsake? ......... I know exactly what they're saying about me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh... Who do you mean?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
The lawyers. All the British defence lawyers. They won't defend me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Goodness! Why...why do say that?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
For the same reason as you noted before. When it happened... ...there was only the victim and myself around. And I ran away from the scene of the crime. I'm not a fool. I know it looks as though I must be the culprit.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It must be very hard for you, Soseki-san...
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
And anyway, I'm a student from overseas. I'm just <span style="color:#E16935">a foreign nobody</span> to them. Someone not to be trusted. I heard them openly laughing about me before. In my earshot, without any compunction at all. 'Any trial for this man would be a waste of time,' they said. And, 'Of course the foreigner did it!' They even had the gall to say, 'The man doesn't understand half of what's being said anyway!'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's awful...!
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
They're wrong! I've studied more English than half of the policemen out there on the streets! I've travelled halfway around the world to learn about these people's country and its great history! But no one here wants to listen to a man with a strange accent. They all hate me! So...at the very least... ...I'd like to entrust my fate to someone who can listen to me, in my native tongue.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
You could do it. ...Couldn't you? When I look into your eyes, I can see it. I can see what you've been through.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Soseki-san, it's just that... ......... Give me a little time, please.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'll do what I can, for the time being.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We shall investigate the case as thoroughly as possible. If we can find some clues, it will give us a much better chance, I'm sure!
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
......... Oh yes! Yes! Thank you! I'll be here! All alone! Waiting for you...Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire!

Tell me about Scotland Yard, Inspector! Ever since I read about it in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', I've been fascinated by the place!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
The Yard...is the most sophisticated policin' organisation you'll find anywhere in the world, ma'am.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, and you know I've always dreamt of wearing a real bobby's helmet!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It does make them look the part. Seeing that policeman there with his helmet on... ...you certainly get the sense that this is a man who will take no nonsense in his duty of protecting the city.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh yes! Doesn't he look wonderful?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Bein' a London bobby is hard going, I can tell you.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, really?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
First thing in the mornin', you know what he does? Goes round and rouses all the labourers on his beat so they can get off to work.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? He wakes people up?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yup. Raps on their windows with a long pole. Did it myself, goin' back a bit.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I had no idea...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
The bobby works for the people of the town. It's just another one of his duties. After that, he starts tirelessly patrolling the streets all day long. He has to cover twenty miles a day. That's the regulation distance.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I can't really imagine how far that is, but it sounds like a long way.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Let me see... Twenty miles... That's approximately the distance from Tokyo to Yokohama.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
On foot?! That's...that's definitely taking things a step too far!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
And when it gets dark, of course, he has the important job of lightin' all the gas street lamps.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my... 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And I suppose in between all of those duties, bobbies are expected to investigate cases as well?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And chase after criminals trying to evade the law!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I'm not sure you could call it 'in between' exactly. More 'alongside'. But yes... ...they're expected to handle those jobs as well. We do have men keelin' over from time to time, I admit.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... I'd always dreamt of wearing one of those helmets, as I said. But it's with a heavy heart, that I shall have to relinquish that dream to you, Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Your heavy heart will be my heavy head if you do.

It happened at around five in the evenin', two days ago. Just there, on that open bit of pavement. The victim - a young woman - was stabbed with a blade from behind.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Is it right that the lady is still unconscious now? You mentioned that she's being treated in hospital.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
...I never said she was a 'lady'. Truth is, unless she comes round pretty smartish, we won't be able to find out much about her at all.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
M-Master criminals?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The, the violent ones?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That's right. He hand picks his victims. Only deals with those guaranteed to go to the gallows for their sins.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But! Mr Natsume wouldn't hang for what he's accused of, surely?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That's just my point, sunshine. Yes, the young woman was stabbed, but it didn't kill her. Couldn't even say the intent was there. So this isn't the sort of case I'd be expectin' the Reaper to want to sink his teeth into, for want of a better phrase.

Yes, he did! He really did! Which makes him <span style="color:#E16935">an involved party</span> in the case. Are you just going to ignore that? ...I hope not! ...I assure you, it's not simply <span style="color:#E16935">my selfish desire</span> to meet with Mr Sholmes again!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The trouble is... ...we have no idea of the man's <span style="color:#E16935">address</span>, even. So how-
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's Baker Street!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
H-How do you know that?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's in the stories, of course! 221B Baker Street... The most famous address in the world!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...I see... Well, there's nothing to stop us from going, I suppose... <span style="color:#0070C0">(We'd better try to find our way there before Susato-san gets any more excited and unpredictable...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Hurrah! I'll summon a carriage!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So, we're to have <span style="color:#E16935">a reunion</span> already... ...with the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes.)</span>

Susato:<br />
...It seems that we can't meet with Mr Natsume at the moment.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
He's being briefed about his appearance in court tomorrow, apparently.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I see. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, the trial is only a day away...)</span> Alright then, let's come back later.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes.

Ryunosuke:<br />
Thank you very much.
</p><p>Man:<br />
It's just up there, overlooking the street. Good day.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Thanks again. This is it...the residence of Mr Herlock Sholmes.
</p>
<center><span style="color:green">19th February, 12:53 p.m.<br />
Sholmes's Suite</span></center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
So this is where the great detective makes his living... <span style="color:#0070C0">(It feels surreal to be here somehow...)</span> Is it as described in the stories, Miss Susato?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...Susato-san?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Many, many famous cases have been solved here in this very room.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! I, I suppose they must have been, yes... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I've never read the stories, so it's hard to get quite as excited about it as she seems to be...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The detective chases the villain relentlessly as he disappears into the fog down an unlit London street... Oh, the thrill of it! The romanticism! Can't you feel your heart thumping in your chest? Can't you, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! I, I suppose I can, yes...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So, if you don't mind... ...I'll just stand here and soak up the atmosphere for a while longer. Please, don't mind me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Haah... <span style="color:#0070C0">(She's obsessed... Well... ...it looks like our detective friend <span style="color:#E16935">isn't home</span> at present.)</span> Excuse me! Is anybody home?
</p><p>???:<br />
Oh! Do we have a visitor? Hello! Is it a big new case for Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Erm...hello. ......... Wait. Aren't you...?
</p><p>???:<br />
Oh! How rude of me! I'll go and make some tea at once!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm sure it's the same girl...)</span> Miss Susato! Did you see the girl who was just here?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh yes... Isn't it truly extraordinary? To think that the King of Bohemia came to this very room to ask Mr Sholmes to take on his case...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The, the King of Bo-where-ia?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
King Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, of course!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Sorry, I'm drawing a blank. Forget 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' for a moment, and look over there!
</p><p>???:<br />
The tea's brewed! And I have a freshly baked cake as well!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah! It's you!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I knew it. Susato-san recognises her, too.)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>???:
</p>
<center>Ah! There you are!</center><p>And taking that with you as well! I was looking forward to the trial run of my experimental smoke grenade launcher! Oh, good day to you! I'm...well, the inventor, I suppose, of that machine.
</p><hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's the girl who turned up at the end of Mr McGilded's trial in the defendants' antechamber.)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
I've never met a lawyer from the Far East before! Poor you, having to get straight to work when you've only just arrived in London.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...yes, it was...challenging.
</p><p>???:<br />
Well, try this tea. It's my special blend, you know!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...um, thank you. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Is tea supposed to look that colour?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my! What a fragrant yet mellow flavour!
</p><p>???:<br />
Hurray! It's a winner! I tried blending different leaves designed to alleviate fatigue, you see. You must be exhausted after your long voyage here. And you have another ticklish trial tomorrow! Oh, and you're to defend a Japanese man. I do wish you lots and lots of luck!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Erm...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Did Mr Sholmes tell you about us, by any chance?
</p><p>???:<br />
Oh! You know Hurley, do you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...'Hurley'? 'Mr Sholmes' to you, surely?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Sholmes was a fellow passenger on the boat that brought us to Great Britain, you see.
</p><p>???:<br />
Was he really? Well, I had no idea! I'm afraid Hurley's out on an errand again today, even though he's just returned from overseas.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Wait a minute... We met this girl for the first time ever yesterday after the trial. And only briefly at that. How on earth does she <span style="color:#E16935">know so much</span> about us?)</span> Did she...<span style="color:#E16935">deduce</span>...all those things, do you think...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And perhaps more to the point... ...why is she here in Mr Sholmes's suite?
</p><p>???:<br />
Oh! Silly me! I haven't introduced myself, have I?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It's a great pleasure to meet you both. My name is <span style="color:#E16935">Iris Wilson</span>. I live here together with Hurley.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, Iris, is it? What a lovely name!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
WHAT?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's the matter?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No, wait, this, this can't be... Did, did you... Did you say that your, your name is...'<span style="color:#E16935">Wilson</span>'?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What's the matter with Susato-san? Why is she so flustered all of a sudden?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, that's right! And what are your names?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, um...I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo, a lawyer from Japan.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Oh! Sorry... I'm Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant, Susato Mikotoba. It's wonderful to meet you!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Lovely! Susie and Runo... Got it!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
'Susie'...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And 'Runo'...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(There's more to this girl than meets the eye... I have so many questions for her, I don't know where to start!)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, and so do I!

It's one of Hurley's inventions. It took him a whole year! He said it was to help him with his investigations.

I keep telling Hurley not to cram so much on those shelves.

...What a shame you couldn't bring it with you to London.

That's right. I just sort of slipped that in.

You did what, Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I didn't really give it a lot of thought, and just started adding it in to the stories.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. Mr Sholmes's exceptional violin playing has been mentioned a number of times.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But the truth is, Hurley had barely touched a violin in his life up to that point.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Of course, people started asking him to play for them after my stories were published. And he wasn't able to tell them that he didn't know how.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What did he do?!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
He went straight to the pawnshop and bought himself a very nice violin. And then he practised. He practised until his fingers very nearly dropped off.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Must be why he's so highly strung.)</span>

Mr Sholmes...would never do something so reckless.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Those are the letters 'V.R.', standing for 'Victoria Regina'. It's Latin for Queen Victoria.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you mean...he shot the Queen into the wall?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
In a moment of boredom, Mr Sholmes adorned the wall with a patriotic sign, that's all. As pistol practice.

Right, that...makes perfect sense now.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's exactly as it's described in the stories! Oh, this is delightful!

Ah! That's a typewriter. It's a machine that allows you to write on paper without needing a pen! And wizardly quick, too!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ooh, that sounds like it could be very useful for someone like me with terrible handwriting.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Wait! Iris, are...are all the stories from 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'-
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes! Every one typed on this trusty machine!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! My! Goodness! ...How wonderful!

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was you that we ran into yesterday, wasn't it? At the Old Bailey.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, that's right! You were ever so helpful. Thank you so much!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh no, not at all. I'm so sorry we couldn't have been more welcoming.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Though, at the time, we did have a rather large gun pointed at us.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...Like this?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
*Gulp!*
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah, thinking back now, you left with Miss Lestrade in tow, didn't you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh yes, that awkward witness, <span style="color:#E16935">Gina Lestrade</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, Ginny? Yes, she's a professional pickpocket.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So we found out.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It was very naughty of her to pinch my invention like that!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Are you referring to that trial disrupting, gun-like contraption?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Exactly! So I followed her, you see, to get it back. Hm...perhaps I should think about fitting a self-destruct mechanism in my inventions...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This girl is dangerous.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Anyway, I brought Ginny back here after that. So she could apologise to my trusty technician.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry, your technician?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hurley, of course, silly!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Hurley...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, Herlock! Herlock Sholmes. We live here together.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I had no idea the great detective had such an... interesting young daughter.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Daughter? Not likely!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I wouldn't call him <span style="color:#E16935">Hurley</span> if he was my father, would I?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well then...what is your relationship with Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, I expect you've found out that lodgings of any kind in London are very expensive. So the solution is to share the cost with a partner. A roommate.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You're...roommates?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I hope you don't mind me asking, Iris, but...how old are you?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ten at last this year!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, what of your mother and father?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, no... They're not around.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, I see... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I wonder what the story is there...)</span>

Of course, of course! Go ahead, Susie!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I am a very great fan of 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', and-
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh! You have a copy of Randst Magazine!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes! I read every issue! It's delivered all the way to Japan on a ship.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, this is so exciting! My stories are being read on the other side of the world!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
'<span style="color:#E16935">My</span>' stories?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's right. Hurley is always solving such amazing cases, you see. And he tells me all about them. They really are quite fascinating! It would be such a shame if I was the only one who ever heard them, don't you think?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Goodness!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Last night, he was telling me all about a new case he just solved on a steamship travelling from a faraway land. So I was just in the middle of typing up the manuscript for the next issue before you came.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So you... You...are the author...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes. I'll let you in on a secret, if you like. I'm going to call this latest adventure, 'The Speckled Band'.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
'The Speckled Band'?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's...certainly very familiar.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Of course, I always change one or two details in the stories. Here and there. This time, I had the idea of making a venomous snake be the cause of all the trouble.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! That was Mr Sholmes's first thought as well, actually.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes. And of course I know that a snake might not be a credible fit for the facts of the case exactly, but... ...it's a story! Some poetic licence is justified to make it more thrilling, I think! Don't you?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So, do you mean to say...? Are the stories about Mr Sholmes that are published in Randst Magazine...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...All written by me? Yes! On my wonderful and very modern typewriter!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But! But all the stories I've ever read... ...are written by a doctor of medicine! Dr <span style="color:#E16935">John H. Wilson</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Susato-san's getting more and more worked up...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah, yes... That's me! I mean, my name really is <span style="color:#E16935">Wilson</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But! But what about <span style="color:#E16935">the doctor of medicine</span> part?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's all true, too. I am a doctor of medicine.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No! At ten years old?!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
At ten years old!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well... That's quite incredible.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But! ...But, but... Dr Wilson is an English <span style="color:#E16935">gentleman</span>!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah, yes... I did alter <span style="color:#E16935">the setting</span> slightly, for the stories to be more compelling.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, it sounds a little strange, doesn't it? A great detective with a ten-year-old girl in tow.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... I...suppose it does, yes.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...about before...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes? Yes? What's on your mind, Runo! Do tell me!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How did you know? That I was a lawyer, and we'd just arrived in London, I mean.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes... Oh! And that we have a difficult trial tomorrow! How did you know all of that?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, that's what you mean.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Please! Tell us how you did it! Explain every detail!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Of course! I'd be delighted. Although...there's really no mystery. Now...let's begin! Iris Wilson is proud to present...her '<span style="color:#E16935">Logic and Reasoning Spectacular</span>'! First of all, I knew already that you were <span style="color:#E16935">a lawyer</span>, Runo. After all, I met you yesterday at the Old Bailey in the defendants' antechamber.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But you also said that we'd <span style="color:#E16935">only just arrived in London</span>. How did you know that?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I observed <span style="color:#E16935">a passport</span> and travel ticket protruding from your breast pocket.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So I was reasonably confident that you must have only just arrived in the country. And on top of that... ...you accepted a case against that particular prosecutor. Telling me you were unaware of London's <span style="color:#E16935">court affairs</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">The Reaper of the Bailey</span>? I walked right into that one, didn't I...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Then I noticed <span style="color:#E16935">a red ink stamp</span> on the back of Susie's hand. You were given that when you visited the local prison to meet with a suspect, weren't you? Earlier today.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
They use those stamps to keep a close eye on comings and goings, you see.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I, I didn't realise...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
And a red stamp is only used for people visiting <span style="color:#E16935">foreign inmates</span>. So...that told me that even though you had only yesterday concluded the trial of Magnus McGilded... ...the two of you had already had cause to visit a foreign inmate at a local prison. However, neither of you was wearing a particularly sad expression on your face. So I concluded that the prisoner was unlikely to be <span style="color:#E16935">a friend</span> or <span style="color:#E16935">a relative</span>. That led me to believe that you must have accepted <span style="color:#E16935">a new case</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I... I see...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But how could you have known that the trial is <span style="color:#E16935">tomorrow</span>?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, having barely been home a few hours yesterday, Hurley solved yet another case. It obviously amused him. He told me that he'd caught a Japanese man who was bawling and trembling.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">A Japanese man</span>? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, clearly that must have been-)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Natsume!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Now, Runo has that fancy <span style="color:#E16935">Japanese sword</span>. And I think your outfit is called <span style="color:#E16935">a kimono</span>, isn't it, Susie? Well anyway, it was clear to me that you both come from Japan yourselves. So I put two and two together and decided you must be defending the Japanese man Hurley caught! And there was only one conclusion those facts could lead me to: You both came here to ask Hurley about the case! There's a note on the mantelpiece that says the man's trial will be tomorrow. Hurley is always stabbing his notes with a knife, you know. He is silly. And...that's all there was to it, really. Thank you for listening! I'm Iris Wilson, and that was one of my 'great deductions'!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well? Was it a winner? Were my deductions correct?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
They... They were spot on!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That was amazing, Iris! Truly a great deduction!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You even managed the 'certain something' of Mr Sholmes's delivery!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, well...I was just copying Hurley's style for that!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
This is really very good news! You could tell us all about the case involving the Japanese man. You will, won't you, Iris? Please!

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So yesterday, Mr Sholmes apprehended a Japanese man, you were saying...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes. Hurley had just arrived back in London after his sea voyage. But the police were waiting for him at the railway station to take him directly to the crime scene.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah... <span style="color:#0070C0">(The great detective is a popular man, it seems.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Apparently a woman was stabbed on a quiet street somewhere in town. There were witnesses who had seen a short, shifty-looking, stooped man running away from the scene.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
A short, shifty-looking, stooped man...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Natsume, beyond any doubt. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Soseki-san said that he didn't see anybody else on the street at all. But it seems there were <span style="color:#E16935">witnesses</span> after all.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hurley used his great deductive powers to determine the man's address. It was a lodging room, very nearby. He went directly there with the police, and what did they find? A short, shifty-looking, stooped man, shivering in fear.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... Mr Sholmes's great deduction certainly hit the mark that time.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Of course it did! He's a great detective!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Still, that means the incident occurred only two days ago. Surely <span style="color:#E16935">tomorrow</span> is too soon for the trial, isn't it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Definitely. We have no time to investigate properly!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hurley says that London is rife with crime.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Scotland Yard is doing its best, but they can't stay on top of it, apparently.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear. I hadn't realised the situation was so dire.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's why they can't afford to spend too much time investigating cases and trying the criminals in court. Staff and money are both short. Crimes are usually pinned on the first suspicious person.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's terrible! I suppose it's the harsh reality of the workings of the world's greatest justice system...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I suppose it is... <span style="color:#0070C0">(But in that case... ...I don't hold out much hope for Soseki-san.)</span>

Thank you for answering so many of our questions, Iris. This has been very informative.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, you're most welcome! I've had so much fun!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Do you happen to know where Mr Sholmes is at the moment? As you guessed, we'd like to ask him some questions about this case as well.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah well... ...I expect Hurley is still investigating the scene.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Of the case involving Mr Natsume, you mean?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, Mr Nuts...ooh-may? Hurley said he was going to the man's lodgings. If you leave now, you'll probably catch him there.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Iris! Do you know where those lodgings are?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well...I imagine the police are still investigating the scene of the crime themselves, aren't they? Did you happen to come across a detective by the name of <span style="color:#E16935">Gregson</span> when you were there?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, we know <span style="color:#E16935">Inspector Gregson</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah, goody. In that case... ...give Gregsy this from me, would you? If you do that, I'm sure he'll tell you what you want to know.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What is this?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
A five shilling piece and a postcard, it seems...
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Iris's postcard has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It reads: 'Tell the gentleman in black whatever he wants to know. I trust that won't be a problem?' Gosh! This will make the inspector help us, will it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Well, thank you, Iris. We'll give it a try.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Good luck, then! I'm going to return to writing my manuscript. 'The Speckled Band'! And I'll be making more special blends of tea, so come back again soon!

We'd be delighted! Thank you so much, Iris. Well, Mr Naruhodo...it's back to the scene of the crime!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:

Um...what was that coin exactly?

It's a silver crown, obviously. But it's a lot more than that. It's...well... It's <span style="color:#E16935">an appearance fee</span>, that's what it is!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
An appearance fee? ...Oh! I see. You mean...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That's right. For 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. Her Ladyship always offers me a little financial reward for featurin' me. Every time!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes! Yes, of course! ...I know all about your exploits, Inspector! I read them avidly!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
'Course, her usin' my name without my say-so does make me the butt of a lot of unpleasant jokes, but still.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I am sorry, Inspector. That must be difficult for you.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Never you mind that! So...what d'you want to know then, eh?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
'Tell the gentleman in black whatever he wants to know. I trust that won't be a problem?' it says. Well obviously it's not a problem! Go on, fire away. What d'you want to know?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, if you wouldn't mind, Inspector... ...we'd very much like to know the address of Mr Natsume's lodgings!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Ah, the little knife-wieldin', moustached Japanese fellow? He lives in a right old hovel. It's just over there, look. On the first floor of that house on the corner where that wreck of a bicycle's propped up.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...That is nearby indeed.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
If I remember rightly, the landlord is <span style="color:#E16935">a Mr John Garrideb</span>. ...Right, well... If you see her again, you make sure you give Her Ladyship my regards, you hear? I mean it! You tell her that Gregson sends his very best wishes!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
D-Don't worry, Inspector. We will.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Goodbye for now then. And long live Her Ladyship!

Well, at least he told us what we wanted to know before he left.

Yes. So then, shall we go and see what we can find in Mr Natsume's lodgings?

Definitely!

Maid:<br />
...May I help you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, yes, would this be the residence of...Mr John Garrideb?
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Indeed it would, sir. And who may I say is calling?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My name is Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I, erm...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo is representing Mr Soseki Natsume. I believe he takes lodgings here?
</p><p>Maid:<br />
...!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We would very much like to ask him some questions about our client.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
...! ...One moment, please. I shall convey the message to Mr Garrideb.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Did you see that, Miss Susato?! That was a real-life English maid!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I know! As I understand it, anyone of standing in English society employs a number of household staff. But that was the first time I've ever seen one in the flesh! Oh, this day keeps getting better!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It certainly feels like we've really arrived now, doesn't it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We need only to meet a butler, and the experience will be complete!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, I'm not sure if I'd go that far, but...I understand the sentiment.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Thank you for waiting. Mr Garrideb will see you now. This way.

<p>Garrideb:<br />
Good day to you. John Garrideb, at your service.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Pleased to meet you, sir. This is Ryunosuke Naruhodo. He's a defence lawyer.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Do excuse me not getting up. Took a shot to the knee a few years back in the Battle of Maiwand, don't you know. Earned a medal for my pains, but had to withdraw from service. Handed over the reins to the up-and-comings.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So he's a retired soldier...)</span>
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
It's a hell of a job getting up and down stairs now, I can tell you. Don't get out much, as you can imagine.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, it's quite a climb up here to the second floor, isn't it? I was panting at the top of the stairs.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You really must take more exercise, Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...do you think so?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, Mr Garrideb, no doubt you were very courageous to earn yourself a medal.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Oh, it was nothing. The medal's just a folderol, really. Wouldn't like to offend the general, though. So I grudgingly displayed it on the wall. Why don't you fetch it down, Joan? Let these good people see it properly.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
.........
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Joan! Fetch the- AAAAAARGH!!! Dash it all, woman! Be careful!
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Oh! Dearie me! I do beg your pardon, sir!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Hmph! You jolly nearly took the skin off my hands!
</p><p>Maid:<br />
I shall be more careful, sir.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
So anyway, there you have it. Living the quiet life now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...I see.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Now then, I hear you want to know about the chap lodging downstairs. Is that right?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes! We would be very grateful if you could answer some questions for us.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Only too pleased, naturally. Especially if it helps to keep the peace here in Blighty. We've forged an alliance with the Empire of Japan recently, as I'm sure you're aware. So this case is very much in public eye, as it were.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Oh, is it?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Even had some famous detective poking around, you know. In this old house, would you believe?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes! Mr Herlock Sholmes!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Hmph, could have been. Didn't catch the chap's name. Not really my cup of tea, all that detective business.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, but...you have a copy of Randst Magazine here, so...
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Eh? Hm? Ah...no, erm...
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Anyway, the chap's investigating the foreigner's room as we speak.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So he's in Soseki-san's room...)</span>
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
It's a bally nuisance, is what it is. The whole neighbourhood's twitching its curtains now. I don't like all this fuss. It's jolly unsettling.

About Mr Natsume then, Mr Garrideb! Please, do tell us!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Ah yes, the Japanese chap. Only been lodging here for a week.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, just one week? So he moved in very recently, then.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
I have two lodgers most of the time. One on the ground floor, and one just below us. The first floor room became available a week ago, you see. There'd been- AAAAAAAAARGH!!! Dash it all, Joan! Do be careful!
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Oh! My goodness! I'm terribly sorry, sir! ......... If you want to know my opinion... ...I thought he was a shady sort from the moment I set eyes on him.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh? Why?
</p><p>Maid:<br />
He seemed to have a most nervous disposition. Always shaking, and looking over his shoulder. The man had 'shady' written across his sweat-soaked brow, if you ask me. I said to myself, 'Joan, that man is trouble. Sooner or later, he's going to do something untoward.' ...And I'm rarely wrong about anything.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(We won't be calling this maid as a witness, that's for sure.)</span>

...! Oh my word, yes! The man was shadier than an orchard!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Could you elaborate?
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Well, take the man's room. Absolutely stuffed full of books, it is. More than anyone could ever read! And he never so much as passes the time of day with another living soul. I haven't seen a single visitor call. He just trots off to that old bookshop every single day, and comes back at five to light the gas fire. And the funny little man is up long past the time everyone else in the house has gone to bed, too.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! I, I see.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
The gentleman on the ground floor goes to bed at around nine each night. But I've never known that Japanese fellow to retire any earlier than two in the morning.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Could you clarify something, I wonder?
</p><p>Maid:<br />
What, pray?

How do you know so much about Mr Natsume's routine?
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'd understood that neither of the lodgers live on this floor of the house. Is that correct?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
That's right, yes. They're both below us. On the first floor and street level.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Then...how is it that you know so much about the lives of your lodgers? The precise times that they come back in the evening, for example. Even the times they go to bed.

It seems that the incident took place at around five in the evening. Did you happen to <span style="color:#E16935">look out of the window</span> at around that time?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Hm? The window?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, we noticed that the window over there looks out over Briar Road. The incident took place <span style="color:#E16935">on the pavement</span> just on the far side of the street. Was there anyone suspicious loitering nearby?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Five o'clock is dinner time in the Garrideb household. So I'm afraid I don't remember seeing anything. How about you, Joan?
</p><p>Maid:<br />
No, sir. It would have been dusk outside already at that hour. And with the fog as well, I should think it would have been quite impossible to see the other side of the road.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, I see.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Did you notice anything else out of the ordinary, then?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Such as...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Anything at all! Even if it seems unrelated.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Hmph, well...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! Yes? Was there something, then?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Well, it's nothing particularly significant, but at around that sort of time in here, there- AAAAAAAAARGH!!! For the love of God, Joan! Watch what you're doing!

Oh dearie me! What have I done? I'm awfully sorry, sir!

Of course, sir. If I may, Mr Narrow-Hollow...

Oh. ...Err, yes?

I have an exceedingly good memory, and as far as I remember... ...nothing of any significance took place here at that hour. Nothing at all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh. Really? Mr Garrideb? The way you were talking before, it sounded rather like there might have been.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Oh, well. As I was saying, it was just a trifling matter really. Nothing of- AAAAAAAAARGH!!! Joan! Dash it all! What is the matter with you, woman!
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Begging your pardon, sir. ...Nothing happened.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
......... Hm, yes. Quite. Nothing happened. We sat down to a quiet, uneventful meal, hm, Joan?
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Thaaat's right, Mr Garrideb.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(What is the matter with these two?!)</span>

Afternoon tea is a time of indulgence, you know. It is quite the English way. It is Mr Garrideb's custom to take two cakes with his tea.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That sounds delightful!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh... Wait a minute, though... There are at least ten cakes on this cake stand.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Well, naturally! And it would never do to waste the leftovers. So whatever Mr Garrideb doesn't eat, I say to myself, 'Joan, you shall have to tidy up.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How...magnanimous of you.

...In truth, I had hoped to invite you both to my Baker Street suite the day we arrived in London. But some Scotland Yarders ambushed me at the railway station and whisked me away to a crime scene. It was an entirely trivial case, of course. I solved the matter in no more than thirty minutes.

It is a mistake to think that one's brain-attic has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. I do my best to forget useless facts, lest they should elbow out the useful ones. Yes! Those are my own words of inimitable wisdom, you know. From an adventure entitled, 'A Study in Scarlet'.

We know this to be the lodgings of a Japanese foreign student by the name of Soseki Natsume. It seems that you assisted in his arrest, Mr Sholmes. For the stabbing of a young woman outside here on Briar Road.

Hm, Natsume... Yes, I believe it was a name rather along those lines.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh? How?

I assure you I have no recollection of accusing your stooped compatriot of the crime.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But that doesn't make sense!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The good detective of Scotland Yard made the following request of me, and I quote verbatim: 'We need you to ascertain the identity and whereabouts of a man seen fleeing the crime scene.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah... A man...seen fleeing...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
There were a number of books scattered on the pavement at the scene. From the bookplates, I was quickly able to determine the bookshop from which they had been purchased. On speaking with the proprietor, I was immediately led to this address. ...Elementary, wouldn't you say? I believe there is a receipt around here somewhere from the establishment in question.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you don't think Mr Natsume is the culprit then!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm...that I could not tell you. But it was aggravating my faculties. Hence why I returned here. However, this place is such a trove of fascinating books, I found myself quite lost in bibliophily. ...Do not be deceived into believing that I am a man of leisure. No no no!

I do apologise. As you may well be aware, many households in London employ a maid.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes! I read as much in my 'Great Britain Primer'.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And so conversely... ...whether or not a household employs a maid has come to betoken the social standing of those dwelling therein.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Betoken their social standing? ...Sorry?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Put simply, my dear fellow... ...those who employ at least a single maid are considered middle class. Those who do not, are beneath that. In the upper echelons of society, of course, households employ enough staff to constitute a large family. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Goodness! How extraordinary...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As you can appreciate, for those on the precarious boundary between the middle and lower classes... ...being able to afford just one maid is of the first importance.

I...I had no idea.

...About this dark little room, Mr Sholmes... Why is there no longer <span style="color:#E16935">a window</span>? Do you have any idea?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
No window?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, I mean, I can clearly see that there is a window... of sorts. But it's been completely blocked with bricks.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, I see. The answer to that question is quite simple: Window tax.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Window...tax? What is that?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Surely...not a tax on <span style="color:#E16935">windows</span>?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Precisely that.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my goodness!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Until relatively recently, a tax was levied on households in this country by the number of their windows. Those of lesser means, having inherited a sizeable and costly family home perhaps, rapidly closed windows up. While the rich opened windows here, there and everywhere... ...in an effort to curry favour with those in power by furnishing them with large sums of tax money.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
How awful! ...And unjust! Forcing people to live in rooms devoid of light!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed, disease was rife as a result. So some forty years ago, or thereabouts, the window tax was abolished. But its legacy remains, as you can see. In squalid lodgings such as these, for example.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I suppose Mr Natsume's stipend for living here in London isn't very generous perhaps...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It would appear so. I've done a little digging... ...and discovered that these lodgings were offered at an extraordinarily low price.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Because the room is so awful, I should think.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Apparently Mr Natsume only moved in here about one week ago.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, that's correct. However... ...I don't believe the low rent is explained by the shabby nature of the accommodation.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Still, that is of little relevance here. A matter not worthy of further attention.

Thank you, Mr Sholmes.

...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(You remembered that, did you?)</span>

Will you perhaps be offering your services in this very matter, I wonder? To the occupant of this room, Mr...Natsume, was it?

......... I'm not sure.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Not sure? On what grounds?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, I actually defended someone in court here only yesterday.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Really? Well then, I congratulate you, sir, on an ambition realised. And so promptly, too.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The thing is... ...it's really made me question things. Am I right to believe in my clients? To <span style="color:#E16935">trust</span> in their innocence?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... Hm, yes. Trust...

Mr Sholmes... ...Mr Natsume didn't do it, did he?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! But... ...I thought that's why you were here. Didn't you come back to investigate?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah yes, that was indeed my initial intention. But there are simply too many fascinating books here. I couldn't possibly ignore them.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...I see.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Nevertheless, there are two facts that I can state quite unequivocally. The man who fled the scene of the crime two days ago was the Japanese occupant of this room. And... ...there are witnesses who swear to having seen the same man commit the crime. ...That is all I can say.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, and one more thing...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! What is it, Mr Sholmes! Tell us!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I cannot say with any certainty whether or not it is of relevance to this case, but I am quite sure... ...that the retired army man who owns this property... is hiding something.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Garrideb is...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Mr Sholmes said as much before actually, didn't he?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Anyway, at present, that is really all that plays on my mind in relation to this case.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo... ...as yet our investigations have uncovered nothing that could help establish Mr Natsume's innocence.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, you're right. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Perhaps it's time we probed a little deeper into Mr Garrideb's <span style="color:#E16935">secret</span>...)</span>

Well, Mr Sholmes is...in his element down there.

I shall be serving dinner shortly, sir.

Hm? Ah... Yes, of course. Frightfully rude of me, but I'm afraid I shall have to ask you to take your leave, if you'd be so kind?

Oh, yes, of course. We are deeply grateful for all your assistance.

Ah... <span style="color:#0070C0">(What's he doing over there?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
M...Mr Sholmes?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah-ha! We meet again, my dear fellows!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Good gracious! When did you sneak in here?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Herlock Sholmes, sir, at your service.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Whatever were you doing over by the window?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I am given to watching the evening sky as the sun sets, madam. Yet sadly, cheerful as the room downstairs undoubtedly is, it lacks an aperture for such observation. So I took the liberty of borrowing a small corner of space by the window up here.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Hmph. Well...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Keeping an eye to one's windows at dusk is the prudent thing to do in London, I'm gathering...)</span>

Oh! Me?

...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Wait, he's not talking about...? Is he? I, I didn't expect to be going through that again so soon...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Do you mean, Mr Sholmes...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
There is a mighty <span style="color:#E16935">secret</span> in this modest room. My eyes see even the most trivial of trifles. I take it you're prepared, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I think so!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
There is just time enough for one of my greatly admired great deductions. Let us conclude the matter before dark! Mr Garrideb... ...though it would seem you are a military man of considerably distinguished service... ...your standing as a landlord is most certainly not what one might call, '<span style="color:#E16935">first-rate</span>'.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I'm afraid, sir, that it is all too clear to me. There are two conclusions I have been able to draw by careful observation of your living arrangements.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
I beg your pardon?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The first... ...is that even as we speak, you are concealing the presence of <span style="color:#E16935">a ferocious beast</span> in your care!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Eh?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And the second... ...is that as a result of <span style="color:#E16935">the beast</span>'s violent rampage, you have lost something very dear to you!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Ah! Er...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo, look!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The old man's broken out in a cold sweat... Unbelievably, it seems Mr Sholmes's conclusions...are both <span style="color:#E16935">spot on</span>!)</span>
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
...How? How could you possibly...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
'How could I possibly know?' you mean to enquire? The answer couldn't be simpler, sir. For in the dense jungle of logic and reasoning...I am <span style="color:#E16935">the king of beasts</span>!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And I know only too well, that wild beasts are not easily tamed. So...shall we begin? Once again, Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his '<span style="color:#E16935">Logic and Reasoning Spectacular</span>'!
</p>
<hr />
<center>
<b>The Great Deduction</b><br />The game is afoot!</center>
<p><b>Topic 1</b><br />
Nature of the Beast
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It certainly shouldn't take a great detective to see... ...that a fearsome beast has been on the rampage of late within these four walls. Thus we are faced with the question: What <span style="color:#E16935">form</span> might this <span style="color:#E16935">beast</span> take? Ah, for a man with a military breeding, your eyes are uncommonly candid.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
I...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Your furtive glance, Mr Garrideb, leads us directly to the answer. The true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>lion statue</b></span>! Yes, though an army man, you appear unimposing at best. A fact that has fuelled your admiration for the mighty lion, the king of beasts.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
What is this piffle, I ask you?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
In the end, your admiration became so great, in fact... ...that you had a living, breathing specimen shipped from India, which you tried to keep in this very house!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
WHAAAT?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yet living with such a wild beast proved more difficult than you had imagined. The chilling traces of a wild rampage are still very much in evidence.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Well!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yet as we look around, the beast in question fails to present itself. Where could this angry creature have disappeared to... madam?
</p><p>Maid:<br />
M-Me?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I pray you do not consider me unchivalrous, but it is plain to me with one glance in your direction.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
It...it is?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Your <span style="color:#E16935"><b>dress pocket</b></span> gives us a handsome clue as to the beast's current whereabouts! For protruding from it is a handbill advertising a circus show.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, you sought to dispose of this terrifying lion, Mr Garrideb. At '<span style="color:#E16935">Batty's Circus</span>'... ...a travelling show currently sojourning in a nearby park. I have observed the tents. You sold the savage lion, sir, to the circus troupe!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
I, I most certainly did not!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...I believe I have made my point. The fearsome beast which ran amok in this room...was an Indian lion! And a simple visit to the circus now will reveal the lion prancing jubilantly through a ring of fire!
</p><p><b>Topic 1</b><br />
Nature of the Beast
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
A rampaging Asiatic lion
</p><p><br />
<b>Topic 2</b><br />
Aftermath
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now...Mr Garrideb... ...it is plainly clear that you still have deep feelings for this formidable 'beast'. Indeed, in that blithe pose, the distress this loss has caused you is veritably tangible.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Your head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>supporting arm</b></span>. Amid fits of tears, you let your beloved beast go. The strain of losing something so dear to you is clearly visible in your visage.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Nonsense man! I, I simply...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But what, we must now ask ourselves, is the true cause of this pain? And we need only follow the direction of your gaze to find the answer. Yes, it is this <span style="color:#E16935"><b>pile of bills</b></span> that has given rise to the pain you suffer. Every envelope contains another demand for payment.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
For cart-loads of meat, potatoes, wheat and tea. Indeed, feeding your beloved has had a devastating impact on the financial circumstances of your household. And so you had no choice but to let it go.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Yes, well, erm...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now...in a final fit of rage, the ferocious beast carried out one last, unimaginable attack...
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Un-Unimaginable...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...The aftermath of which can be clearly seen by observing the carpet over there! A very expensive woollen carpet, if I am not mistaken.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Oh dearie me...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
What could have caused such a destructive outburst?
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...This time, madam, I'm afraid it is you who has inadvertently revealed the truth to me. Your wandering eye has settled upon the answer very neatly indeed. Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>tower of cakes</b></span>!
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
There is no creature more dangerous on this earth than a beast with an unsatiated appetite. Was it or was it not once said by a noblewoman, 'If they have no bread, let them eat cake'? Food is at the heart of all tragedy, in fact.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Whatever do you mean?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Having tired of the taste of cake, the beast began to stalk its next prey. I'm sure I need not spell out the nature of this final act of destruction carried out by the beast. There is only one logical conclusion: Worked into a frenzy by hunger, the lion attacked and ate the carpet! The teeth marks in the carpet...are a perfect match with those of a lion I once saw in India.
</p><p><b>Topic 2</b><br />
Aftermath
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
Carpet gnawed on by the starving lion
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this beastly puzzle!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Garrideb:<br />
AAAAAAAAARGH!!! What is the matter with you, Joan?! You're pouring scalding hot tea all over me!
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Oh...I'm sorry, Mr Garrideb. I'm afraid I didn't notice.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
My deductions can be startlingly sharp. It stands to reason that your cup runneth over. Indeed, my revelations can make people spill tears at times, too.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Erm, Mr Sholmes, sorry to butt in...again. But could I make an observation?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Why certainly, Mr Naruhodo. What is it...again?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, your deductions just now... Do you really think <span style="color:#E16935">a lion</span> could have fit inside a room of this size?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed. It is the only explanation for the facts. The terrifying truth all too often lies beyond the realms of common sense!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(But wouldn't it be an idea to consider what lies inside the realms of common sense as well?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But...if an uncaged lion had <span style="color:#E16935">run amok</span> in this very room... ...surely Mr Garrideb and his maid would have been hurt...or worse.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, that's where you are stuck. No doubt the former military man held his own against the beast using that large cannon.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I thought you said that they sold the lion to the circus...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And what about the food? Meat and potatoes are one thing... ...but I don't believe I have ever heard of a lion that drinks <span style="color:#E16935">tea</span>.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, my dear Miss Susato. It occurs to me with some regularity... ...that irrespective of race and breeding, whenever anyone lands on Great British soil... ...they are infused with a highly appropriate taste for afternoon tea!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! ...What a glorious notion! Well then, Mr Naruhodo! It's your turn to shine again!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I...had a feeling that was coming.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
A slight massage, that's all Mr Sholmes's deductions need. You can do it!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Excellent. I've been waiting for my trusty partner in deduction to step forward, Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...We don't even know yet whether or not this is going to help with Mr Natsume's case. Still... ...uncovering the truth is always worthwhile, whatever the motivation! ...At least, that's what I want to believe...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Let us start again from the beginning... ...of Herlock Sholmes's '<span style="color:#E16935">Logic and Reasoning Spectacular</span>'!
</p>
<hr />
<center>
<b>Course Correction</b><br />Hold it, Mr Sholmes!</center>
<p><b>Topic 1</b><br />
Nature of the Beast
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
A rampaging Asiatic lion
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It certainly shouldn't take a great detective to see... ...that a fearsome beast has been on the rampage of late within these four walls.

</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
I...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Your furtive glance, Mr Garrideb, leads us directly to the answer. The true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>lion statue</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I really didn't see the lion thing coming.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No, but if you observe Mr Garrideb's reaction... ...it rather seems as though some beast did indeed run amok here in this room.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, something with a very fierce nature.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But it couldn't have been a lion transported from India.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So what was it, then?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We must follow Mr Garrideb's gaze. That will lead us to the true answer!

...we can still make out her mighty arms, and note the considerable horsepower they must contain.

Indeed! Surely any woman of such powerful constitution would be honoured to be described as a 'beast'!

Um...'honoured' might be stretching a point...

The chilling traces of a wild rampage are still very much in evidence.

...It would appear that you don't live in the most comfortable of circumstances. After all, you are a retired army man, yet you are in the business of renting out rooms.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Tsk...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I would assume, therefore, that you have insufficient means to employ a maid. ...Would that be correct?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
It's not right, I tell you! I was second lieutenant of the third regiment! A man has his pride, don't you know! By golly, it's a sorry thing when a chap can't even afford to have a single maid in his employ!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, here in London, one is rather judged. A household cannot be considered worthy of society if it employs no staff at all. Though in my considered opinion, such concerns about appearances are a folly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You, you mean Mr Garrideb has his wife...work as his maid?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Precisely. ...Am I right, Mr Garrideb?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Only in company, obviously. But listen here! This must remain a secret! <span style="color:#E16935">Tip-Top secret</span>! Please!

</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
Carpet gnawed on by the starving lion
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now...Mr Garrideb... ...it is plainly clear that you still have deep feelings for this formidable 'beast'. Indeed, in that blithe pose, the distress this loss has caused you is veritably tangible.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Your head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>supporting arm</b></span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Sholmes is quite something. He's still calling Mr Garrideb's wife a 'beast'.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, as a woman, that feels rather uncomfortable.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But Mrs Garrideb is standing beside her husband as we speak. In other words...he hasn't lost his beloved at all, has he?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, how true! So perhaps that supporting arm that seems to be propping up his head... ...has some other significance, then!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
According to Mr Sholmes, Mr Garrideb's pain is tangible, though. <span style="color:#0070C0">(What could that pose of his really signify...?)</span>

Sometimes it's hard to read people's expressions. A man may have his head in his hands for many reasons. Perhaps because he's in great pain, certainly. Or perhaps because he's lost in a wonderful memory of the past. I believe, Mr Garrideb, that you're in the throes of being lost in wonderful memories of great pain!

Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.

Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What is the cause of this acute pain that Mr Garrideb obviously feels?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's rather strange, you know. He always seems to look at us only out of the corner of his eye.

Your head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>slapped cheek</b></span>!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And of course, the deliverer of that impressive mark on your cheek that refuses to fade... ...was you, Madam Joan Garrideb!
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Well, yes...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You have been desperate to hide the slap mark on your cheek, sir.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Agh! How the blazes...? How did you work that out, man?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Nothing escapes the notice of one trained in the art of observation, my dear fellow.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's why you haven't looked directly at us even once... To keep your other side from view!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Well, um... Hmph.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now then, let us proceed to the next conundrum. Why were you subjected to such a violent slap? In other words, we must ask ourselves what caused Madam Garrideb to fly into a rage? And we need only follow the direction of your gaze to find the answer. Yes, it is this <span style="color:#E16935"><b>pile of bills</b></span> that has given rise to the pain you suffer.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Didn't Mr Sholmes say that the bills were all for lion fodder?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, but now we've established that the lion never existed. Which can only mean that the thing responsible for gobbling up all that food... ...was Mr Garrideb's wife.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo! She's a person, not a 'thing'!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, well... She's also a person who gave her husband a mighty slap round the face. One so hard that it left a perfect hand mark, in fact.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, why would a woman want to hit her husband with such force, I wonder?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I'd love to know the answer to that question.

<p>Yes, it is this <span style="color:#E16935"><b>pile of bills</b></span> that has given rise to the pain you suffer.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We already know what the cause of Mr Garrideb's pain is, of course, don't we?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The slap across the cheek which left that bright-red mark.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Garrideb and his wife seem to share a very deep and loving bond.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Perhaps. But it's said that the stronger people's feelings are, the more fiercely they react to betrayal.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You seem to know a lot about the ways of the heart, Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I read it in a popular novel that I borrowed from Kazuma. <span style="color:#0070C0">(So we're looking for <span style="color:#E16935">a reason</span> why Mrs Garrideb would have felt betrayed by her husband, then!)</span>

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
'Oh James, I love you. Yours, Mary'. ...Passionate indeed. Perhaps the sender of this note, a certain Miss Mary, is the fly in the ointment here?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
GAAARGH! But! I don't know the bally woman!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You <span style="color:#E16935">don't know</span> her?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
That note wasn't written to me! It was just in the book. I don't know how it got there!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It was '<span style="color:#E16935">just</span>' in there, you say?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
That's right! That's what I've been say- AAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</p><p>Maid:<br />
A likely story!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Now listen here, Joan, old thing! I explained at the time! I bought the book at that secondhand place. And that note must already have been in there.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...the previous owner of the book was using the note as a bookmark, you mean?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
That's right! That's what I've been say- AAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</p><p>Maid:<br />
A likely story!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
For heaven's sake, woman! Look at the name! It's written to 'James'! My name, in case you'd forgotten, is John! AAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</p><p>Maid:<br />
A likely story!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Are, are you questioning my name now?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And there we have it... Arouse the suspicions of the female heart, and you unleash <span style="color:#E16935">a beast</span> with a most ferocious bite.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now...in a final fit of rage, the ferocious beast carried out one last, unimaginable attack...
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Un-Unimaginable...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...The aftermath of which can be clearly seen by observing the carpet over there! A very expensive woollen carpet, if I am not mistaken.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Oh dearie me...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
What could have caused such a destructive outburst?
</p><p>Maid:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...This time, madam, I'm afraid it is you who has inadvertently revealed the truth to me. Your wandering eye has settled upon the answer very neatly indeed. Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>tower of cakes</b></span>!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But...but surely Mrs Garrideb didn't...eat the carpet?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, of course not. But there doesn't seem to be any doubt... ...that the state of disarray that this room is in is a result of her wild temper.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...No, that's true. So, this is the last part of Mr Sholmes's deduction that we need to fix. We need only to follow Mrs Garrideb's gaze, and that will tell us the real answer.

Alright. Let's see what we can see!

Yes!

As you can see, the cakes on this cake stand have been strewn far and wide. In fact, I have a strong suspicion, that some of the delicious cream was thrown onto the carpet. But to a woman with a very sweet tooth, such waste would be unforgivable. So she ate it up, carpet and all!

Now, this circus handbill was discounted as part of an earlier deduction already. I realise that. And I also realise that just because it was the wrong answer then doesn't make it the right answer now. But when in doubt, my approach is present, present and present again!

<p>Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>tower of cakes</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The real question here is... ...was the carpet actually eaten by something, or did something else happen to it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Perhaps that would be answered by examining the carpet in more detail. If we can find another possible explanation, maybe it will lead us to the right answer.

Good idea! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, the point is, how did the carpet end up like that?)</span>

Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>candlestick</b></span>!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Most illuminating, my dear fellow! And of course, the only possible way out of this logical labyrinth.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, the remnants of a ferocious attack in which the carpet was devoured are clearly visible.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed they are. <span style="color:#E16935">The scorch marks</span> at the edge clearly give the truth away.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Scorch marks?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It would appear that this room was the scene of a little marital altercation.
</p><p>Maid:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mrs Garrideb's mighty arm muscles left an impression not only on her husband's face...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...but on the entire room. The force of her strike caused a candle to fall from the holder...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...and in seconds the carpet was alight, and the whole corner of the room in flames!
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Yes, erm... Hm...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
For the most ferocious beast in this world is neither a violent lion nor a vengeful woman...but <span style="color:#E16935">fire</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And in this room, that ferocious beast bared its claws and ran amok.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Eloquently put, my dear fellow. So you see, there is but one conclusion here:
</p><p>After the sparks of marital discord flew, this room was the scene of <span style="color:#E16935">a fire</span>!

<p>Garrideb:<br />
It's these dashed long winter nights, you know. Nothing to do but read in front of the fire. Luckily, there's a jolly good secondhand bookshop just around the corner. Buy all my old novels there.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And in the pages of one particular novel, you discovered some rather illicit material?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
For which your wife admonished you harshly, it seems.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
I don't know about 'admonished'. 'Demolished' might be rather closer to the mark. And '<span style="color:#E16935">beast</span>' is most certainly an apt des- AAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Here we go again...)</span> And the carpet? Was that destroyed by fire when a candle fell on the floor?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
'Fraid to say it was. Happened in the blink of an eye, you know. The whole place filled with smoke. Couldn't see a bally thing. I was caught between the old stick's rage and the raging flames.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You paint a torrid picture, sir. ...One that would have been most entertaining.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's sympathy for you...)</span>
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Didn't take long for the fire to spread, of course. The bally furniture started going up as well! We've had to hide the mess behind that screen for the time being.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Over here, Mr Garrideb?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, you have nothing more to hide now. If you'll allow me...
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Had all my favourite old novels in that case. But as soon as the fire got hold of them, that was it. Whoosh! Up in smoke!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Gosh...
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Then the wife started hurling things at me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What a terrible sight it must have been.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
There was I, back up against the window, <span style="color:#E16935">under heavy enemy fire</span>! Incendiary books incoming ten to the dozen. Worst of it is, I lost my favourite. Book called 'The Lion's Pride'.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
'The Lion's Pride'? Ah yes, your notorious love of big cats coming through again.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
I assure you, the title didn't influence my choice in the slightest.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So the poor man really did <span style="color:#E16935">lose something dear</span> to him as a result of the ferocious 'beast's' rampage.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Sholmes's deductions turned out to be correct once again!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...It can only be described as a great British wonder.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
I tell you, it was total carnage. Flames everywhere and the old stick in full fettle!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Out of interest, what time of day was that?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Hm, not sure I can remember. It was two days ago now. Let's see... Around five o'clock, I think.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So at exactly the same time... ...as a terrifying incident was unfolding outside your window on the street below.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Hmph. Even more terrifying on the inside, I can assure you. The whole of Blighty could have been flattened outside my window at that moment... ...and I wouldn't have noticed a dashed thing!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh...really?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, Mr Naruhodo? What can I do for you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, I think we've got to the bottom of Mr Garrideb's situation now. But what does it have to do with Mr Natsume's circumstances?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I can't help you there, I'm afraid.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
My dear fellow, if you recall, I did say as much from the outset. I warned you that although I knew the retired army man to be hiding something... ...I <span style="color:#E16935">could not be sure</span> whether his secret would prove to be of relevance or not.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I... I just knew you were going to say that!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Now now, Mr Naruhodo. You mustn't lose heart. Bear in mind... ...that all things fall into one of only two categories: Those relevant to the case, and those not.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That makes no sense to me.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, no matter. It is of far greater importance that you make up your mind now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Visiting hours at the prison will soon be over.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh no! Is it that time already?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
If we're to accept Mr Natsume's case... ...we have official paperwork to attend to.

Oh dear. But at least the whole room wasn't engulfed in flames.
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Hmph. I suppose so. But my whole collection went up in smoke, you know. All those novels I adored so much.
</p><p>Joan:<br />
Tsk. Well, John, whose fault is that?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Not mine, that's for sure!
</p><p>Joan:<br />
......... Well...whoever may or may not be to blame... ...I'm quite sure you can buy some new old books to replace them, can't you?
</p><p>Garrideb:<br />
Hmph! 'New old books'? Bally nonsense!

Susato:<br />
It's time, Mr Naruhodo. We must hurry back to the prison!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I know. Let's hail a carr- ......... Oh.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What's the matter?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It looks like something's going on over there in front of the Garridebs' house.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...?
</p><p>???:<br />
I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers!
</p><p>???:<br />
Who are you calling an old man...you rum-lookin' niminy-piminy?!
</p><p>???:<br />
'There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,<br />
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'
</p><p>???:<br />
Who's this Horatio fella, eh? What are you on about?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Excuse me...
</p><p>???:<br />
Eh? What the...? Who are you now?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm sorry, it just looked as though there might be some problem here. And my associate here, Mr Ryunosuke Naruhodo, is a lawyer, you see.
</p><p>???:<br />
Eh? A lawyer? ...What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If I can be of any assistance, I'd be happy to help. I'm from Japan, but I have studied English law.
</p><p>???:<br />
Tsk! Fine! I'll be on me way for today. But you mark my words! This ain't over yet!
</p><p>???:<br />
Get thee to a nunnery!
</p><p>???:<br />
Do I look like a bloomin' nun to you?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I do hope you're not injured?
</p><p>???:<br />
O, fair Eastern maiden, thou art so gentle! Thank you!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What was that all about?
</p><p>???:<br />
'There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,<br />
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Erm...I'm not Horatio, either.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Forgive the enquiry, sir, but... ...are you a lodger here? In the Garrideb residence?
</p><p>???:<br />
O, fair Eastern maiden, thou art so right! Yes, I do dwell in this humble abode.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Mr Garrideb mentioned that he had another lodger, didn't he? This must be the man.)</span> Do you happen to know the other lodger, who lives on the first floor?
</p><p>???:<br />
Ah, yes. A gentleman named Natsume? O, more worthy a polemist in my battle of words ne'er could there be!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? Battle, did you say?
</p><p>???:<br />
Who is the stronger, Hamlet or Macbeth? Mr Natsume and I sparred long into the night!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I see.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I, I don't fully understand, but it seems Mr Natsume and this gentleman are acquaintances at least.
</p><p>???:<br />
So, fair maiden! So good gentleman... ...I can tarry here no longer! Fare thee well!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I didn't really understand him, but I think he's returned to his room.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It seems he's unaware of what's happened to Mr Natsume, so he can't really help us. <span style="color:#0070C0">(With Soseki-san and that man as lodgers, the Garrideb house is certainly full of eccentrics.)</span> Anyway, I'll go and find a carriage.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. I'm sure Mr Natsume is eagerly awaiting our return!

Ah! Oh! It's... Yes! Agh! It's... It's YOU! THE MISERABLE, ROTTEN SPY! HERR LOCK SHOLMES!!!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Sholmes! What are you doing here?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I have no intention of 'doing' anything per se. Save <span style="color:#E16935">observing</span>, of course.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Whatever do you mean, Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, having encountered some curious reading material in that gloomful room... ...and having unmasked the secret identity of that eccentric pair... ...I decided I should drop in on my way home. To see how our divested friend is faring.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Gloomful room?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
At least your accommodation here offers a window, my dear fellow. In that sense, it is the superior option. Anyway, I must commend you on your taste in books. My day has been a delight, and cost me not a penny.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
AAARGH!!! YOUUU!!! HOW DARE YOU, HERR LOCK SHOLMES!!! ......... .........Ugh. I've had it. I'm through. I'm at the end of my rope. I should never have come to Great Britain. It was a terrible mistake. Haunted by spirits in those accursed lodgings... No doubt my luck will be cursed in tomorrow's trial as well... MY WHOLE LIFE IS BEDAMNED!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What are you thinking, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...He mentioned that once before, didn't he? That <span style="color:#E16935">his lodgings were cursed</span>, I mean.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And there is much truth in Mr Moustache's words.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
'<span style="color:#E16935">Cursed</span>' is a wholly appropriate description, I would say. For the man's lodgings...and indeed for tomorrow's trial.

Oh...I see. <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's really agitated him...)</span>

You... You... You don't mean...? The trial really IS cursed somehow?!

Are you referring to the prosecutor? <span style="color:#E16935">The Reaper of the Bailey</span>?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
The, the reaper?! Oh no! What do you mean? Please! Tell me! Summarise it succinctly <span style="color:#E16935">in sixteen salient words</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No defendant has ever survived a trial in which the Reaper stands for the prosecution...ever.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
......... OH MY GOODNESS! CAN IT REALLY BE TRUE?! THAT WAS SIXTEEN WORDS EXACTLY!!!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yesterday, Mr Naruhodo successfully defended someone against the Reaper. But then...after the trial was over... ...the defendant passed away in...unusual circumstances.

Ah, I am impressed, Miss Susato. You have an eye for detail.

Actually, the Lord Chief Justice told us.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Sholmes... ...surely it can't be that having failed the have the accused convicted... ...Lord van Zieks <span style="color:#E16935">killed the man himself</span>?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh no! He couldn't have, surely?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... Ah ha ha ha ha hah! You have some wonderful notions!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Sorry?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The man isn't a mass murderer; he's a court prosecutor, my dear fellow!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh...yes... Why, of course he is!
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Argh! 'Of course he is'?! THEN WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SCARE ME?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It could be said, however... ...that the real truth about the man is even more terrifying than your hypothesis.

Van Zieks is a quite exceptional man. However, in London courts of law... ...'exceptional' does not equate to winning every case without exception.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Aah! That's, that's good!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Soseki-san looks like he's going to cry tears of joy.)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As you are no doubt aware, in a British criminal trial, there is both a judge and a jury. The judge officiates based on the letter of the law, whilst the jury offers public opinion and common sense. It is an excellent system, whereby the defendant's guilt is considered from several points of view. However, <span style="color:#E16935">public opinion</span>, in particular, is somewhat easily manipulated.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Right...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Criminals, and corrupt lawyers for that matter, can use it to their advantage. By any means at their disposal. Contriving evidence, calling imposters as witnesses, and so on. By such underhand means, those who would want to are able to sway the jury. Which means that even in the light of irrefutable evidence, the prosecution can fail.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But it means the wrong verdict can be passed!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And sadly is from time to time, my dear madam. It is simply <span style="color:#E16935">the reality</span> of the situation.. <i>[sic]</i>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And that's alright?)</span>

Oh my...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Though the adjudication may see them leave the courtroom with their freedom... ...within months, they all...<span style="color:#e16935">disappear</span>! It is most striking.

Ah, by all manner of misfortune, sir. Perhaps they are trampled under a passing carriage. Perhaps they fall into the Thames and drown. Perhaps they are suddenly overcome by a raging fever. Or perhaps attacked by highwaymen.

When you said 'accursed lodgings' before, you were referring to your room at Mr Garrideb's house, I assume? Do you mean to say you believe the place is cursed?
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
......... It's been a year now since I came to Great Britain. But I'd only been in London a week before I started to notice strange feelings in myself.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That didn't take long then.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Everywhere I looked there were foreign faces staring at me... Laughing behind my back... I, I was sure people were talking about me. I started to become nervous about going outside. They were always staring at me! All the time! From dawn till dusk! So I shut myself away in my room. ...But even that didn't help. The fear wouldn't go away.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You must have been very lonely, having been away from your homeland for such a long time.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
I've had to move a number of times. Most recently, to that room on Briar Road, a week ago now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, why did you choose there? It seems a little...inconvenient.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
The rent is cheap. I have so little money, it appealed to me straight away. Of course, I asked why it was so affordable. The landlord just simpered and said: 'The room is cursed. ...Oops!' He quickly tried to cover his mistake, but it was too late. So I told him... ...if you have something to say, then say it! But if not, DON'T MENTION IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. ...Well said.
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
But it was true! It was all t-t-true!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You mean... <span style="color:#0070C0">(...the room really is cursed, then?)</span>
</p><p>Soseki:<br />
Ever since I moved into that windowless hellhole... ...my sleep has been plagued with nightmares! I awake feeling as though I'm being choked to death!

The Burya... The Burya... ...Ah, that case!  The one with the snake?

But! I could have been lying! Surely you must have had your doubts? You must have suspected me a little.

But...I could have betrayed your trust!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! In that case, I should have made an elementary error of judgement, nothing more. Betrayal of trust is an overused excuse, in my opinion.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Meaning...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Whether or not one should trust another is, in the final analysis, down to oneself. It is a matter of whether or not one can trust oneself.

And Mr Sholmes believes in me now, too. So it's time... Time that I learnt to believe in myself. Soseki-san has no one. He's all alone. So it's my job to help him. To fight his corner. Tomorrow. In the courtroom. With all the strength I can muster!)</span>
