Ryunosuke:<br />
Good morning, Gina.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm determined to prove your innocence today. I'm sure we can do it!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... So where's yer friend then?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Ya know, 'er in the fancy dress. ...Susarto or 'owever you say it. I dunno.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, Miss Susato had to leave early in the morning. She was already gone by the time I woke up.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... You alright wiv that, are ya? Forget about me, if ya like. Go and see 'er off.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...It's fine. It's not as though Miss Susato and I won't meet again... one day.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
E-Even so...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But you, Gina... ...you only get one chance. This trial today is all we have.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...!
</p><p>???:<br />
Good morning, you two!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
How are you feeling, Ginny? Did you manage to sleep?
</p><p>Wagahai:<br />
Miaow...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Iris! Wot are you doin' 'ere?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What do you mean? When a friend is in need, we show our support! Isn't that right, Waggy?
</p><p>Wagahai:<br />
Miaow...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah! Waggy!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Great way to show your support, kitty.)</span>
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Let 'im 'ave a nose around. Wot 'arm can it do?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, that reminds me. I bought a paper on the way here. Now, would you like the good news or the bad news? What do you say, Runo? Ginny?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, well, I think I'd rather get <span style="color:#E16935">the bad news</span> out of the way first.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Nah, always take <span style="color:#E16935">the good news</span> first. Ya might not live to 'ear the bad.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes...that question always gives away people's <span style="color:#E16935">personalities</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Let's not go there.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Alright then, I'll give you the bad news first. A record amount of rain has fallen this morning, and carriages all over the capital are struggling to move.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Huh? <span style="color:#0070C0">(The bad news...was a weather report?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So I hope that Susie made her train to Dover and that the train isn't delayed on its way to the port.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Gosh...yes.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Alright then, so wot's the good news?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well! The rain is forcast to subside this afternoon. So even if the train is delayed, it should be able to make up the time later! Well? That is good news, isn't it?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I couldn't give a monkey's, really.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If only all good news cancelled out the bad.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
And look! This trial has made the headlines, too! 'Pawnbroker Perishes in Pickpurse Plunder!' See?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Tsk, 'ow d'you like that? Well let 'em say wot they want! See if I care!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...I can't, because you're covering your face.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Don't worry! Runo will soon show everyone that this headline is nonsense.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I will?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
And then, in tomorrow's papers, the headline will be: 'Discharged Diver is Dauntless Do-Gooder!' ...Isn't that right, Runo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, um...yes. Let's hope so.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Of course they will! I have absolute faith in you! ...How was that? I was trying to sound like Susie. Did it work? Did it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">17th April, 10:00 a.m.<br />
The Old Bailey Courtroom</span></center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. This trial shall determine the guilt or innocence of Miss Gina Lestrade. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution is ready.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The defence...is ready.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Lord van Zieks...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...My Lord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Remind me, how many years ago was it that you withdrew from the public prosecution service?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... It was some five years ago, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, and then two months ago you resurfaced somewhat unexpectedly. And here you are again today. Are there some circumstances of which the court should be aware that have led to this...erratic behaviour?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In what one might describe as your former life five years past... ...you dealt exclusively in matters concerned with the highest echelons of society and government.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Really...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yet today you choose to try a simple case of burglary and murder. I confess I find it more than a little befuddling, Counsel.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... There are two types of person I cannot abide. Firstly, those wealthy scoundrels who hide behind a mask of philanthropy to cheat the public at large...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
He means Mr McGilded, who you defended against the Reaper two months ago.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes, I'd just about managed to work that out. Thank you. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Magnus McGilded... If I'd known what a monster he was, I never would have defended him.)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...And secondly - even more loathsome... ...those wily scoundrels who masquerade as allies only to effect total betrayal in the final hour. In other words, the confidence tricksters from those tiny islands in the Far East...<span style="color:#E16935">the Nipponese</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Did he really just say that?!)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
He means you now, Runo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I actually managed to work that out, too. Thank you, Iris. '<span style="color:#E16935">Total betrayal</span>'? What are you talking about?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That torrid look of hatred in Lord van Zieks's eyes... Was that directed solely at me? Or was he talking about all <span style="color:#E16935">Japanese</span> people?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......... An alarmingly scathing explanation, Lord van Zieks. Still, the judiciary welcomes the return of the so-called 'Reaper of the Bailey', feared by all London's malefactors.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Your Lordship is too kind.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, jurors... The six of you have been selected at random to represent the will of the people in this trial. Are you ready to hear the evidence placed before you, and determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Former lieutenant in the British Army here, don't you know. Chaps like me were born ready!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Clean crockery, clean cutlery and a clean conscience. His Lordship's motto is very appropriate here, I think.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Everything will be <span style="color:#E16935">stereoscopic</span> in the future! Absolutely, absolutely everything! And I'm ready for it!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
I don't understand it. I can't have left it in there. It's not possible. ...But could I have?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Women indispensable in society. Stop. Female-centric future awaits. Stop.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Is something wrong, Runo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...not exactly. It's just... ...I'm fairly sure <span style="color:#E16935">I recognise these jurors</span>. Almost all of them, in fact...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Reeeally? Funny coincidences like that do happen from time to time, don't they? But it is quite strange. The jurors are chosen at random from London's six million inhabitants, you know.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...So I've been led to believe. <span style="color:#0070C0">(But something tells me I'm being duped.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. Now, Lord van Zieks... ...the court calls upon the prosecution to introduce the facts of the case.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As you wish, My Lord. Allow me to begin with a word of warning to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury. In short... ...there has never been a more self-evident case of cold-blooded murder.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The victim, Mr Pop Windibank, proprietor of a pawn shop on Baker Street, was shot from behind and died instantly. The prosecution presents this photographic print of the crime scene. As the court will observe, there is a single bullet wound just below the gentleman's left shoulder. The evidence suggests that the bullet pierced the man's heart resulting in near instant death. Moving on to the findings of Scotland Yard's coroner... His report states that the bullet entered the body on <span style="color:#E16935">a rising diagonal trajectory</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And...what's that supposed to tell us?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It means...the victim was likely shot by someone significantly <span style="color:#E16935">shorter in height</span> than himself. Someone...like the accused, you might say.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution wishes to present the autopsy report and crime scene photograph as evidence, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed. The court accepts. Hand them to the bailiff, please.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The crime scene photograph has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I now ask the court to turn its attention to this plan of the establishment where the incident occurred. The proprietor, was found in the storeroom where he kept articles pawned to him. A windowless room with a single point of entry - a door to the main shop that was found locked. In this 'sealed chamber' there were <span style="color:#E16935">only two persons</span> present: The victim, Mr Windibank...and the accused.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It may further interest the court to know that when the accused was discovered at the scene... ...she had in her hand <span style="color:#E16935">the gun</span> used to fire the fatal bullet!
</p>
<center>...Well, that's that then, isn't it? Nothing more to say.<br />
<p>...Isn't that grubby little girl a pickpocket anyway?<br />
...She's one of those filthy drabs that live in the slums in the East End.<br />
</p>
Oh well, it was only a matter of time before she got blood on her hands, then...<br />...What are the jurors waiting for? The girl's guilty as hell!</center>

We can't jump to conclusions here! We mustn't assume her guilt because of what she has to do to survive!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...My learned Nipponese...friend. It is you who mustn't jump to conclusions. The prosecution has barely begun presenting its case.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Conveniently, this appalling act of murder... ...did not go unobserved. There were witnesses.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious!

After their testimony, this girl's true nature will be exposed. Pitiful pickpurse...or cold-hearted killer? Here's to establishing the truth.

It's our older bruv! Lost contact wiv 'im, we 'ave! So we're scourin' every shady corner o' the capital!

</p><p>Ringo:<br />
'E is, Nash, 'e is! The very spit of 'im!
</p><p>Nash:<br />
So we decided there an' then wot we woz gonna do. We woz gonna call ya...

<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Sulky Skulkin? And that's before he's run out of chips...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well then...Inspector Sulky Gregson...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Beggin' your pardon, My Lord, but the name's Tobias.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What I would like to know, Inspector, is what you are doing in the witness stand.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The Skulkin Brothers are currently under arrest, My Lord, on suspicion of theft.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph. Thieves, are they, these three?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
No, My Lord. Beggin' your pardon, but please don't lump me in with this lot.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Two nights ago, these two brothers illegally entered an establishment with intent to burgle. And in the course of their nefarious activities, they became embroiled in a far more sinister crime.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
By Jove, you mean to say...? What an extraordinary coincidence!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Indeed, My Lord. While attempting to burglarise the pawnbrokery, they witnessed its proprietor's murder.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The various trespasses of these brothers is not the subject of today's proceedings... ...though they will naturally face trial in the very near future.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
With Your Lordship's permission, I'd like to remain in the stand to keep these gents on the straight and narrow.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Of course, Inspector. Sceptical as I am about the calibre of these witnesses, I will permit them to take the stand.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Mr and Mr Skulkin...you will now testify before the court. Describe the events of the night in question, and what exactly you saw.
</p><p>'Appy to! ...Cos a Skulkin's never skulkin'!

<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... A terrible coincidence, it would seem. At the precise moment these miscreants entered the property, an even more sinister crime was afoot.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The witnesses' testimony is consistent with the crime scene in every detail. The door providing access to the storeroom from the main shop was indeed locked from the inside. And within, only the victim and the accused were found.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... I must say, it does appear to be an overwhelmingly simple case. Still, the defence may cross-examine the witnesses now, of course. Counsel, if you please...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Do you mean the door between the main shop and the storeroom?

If my learned friend is having difficulty grasping the situation, perhaps a drawing would help. Excluding the shop's entrance from the street, there is only one other door. That of the storeroom.
</p><p>Nash:<br />
'Course there woz only a little oil lamp burnin'. Not much to see by.
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
An' the door woz 'idden be'ind a curtain an' all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's right. When we arrived, the door was mostly obscured by the curtain.)</span> Tell me... ...why exactly did you try to open that door?

Any normal petty thief would run at the sound of a gunshot, I should think.

Well, Nash, erm...yeah... ...I s'pose...you'd 'ave to say we ain't 'normal', eh?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Broadly speaking, humans respond in one of two ways on hearing a gunshot or scream: The timid flee, gripped by fear, while the courageous investigate to see if they might help. These gentlemen are of the latter inclination. My learned Nipponese friend, it would seem, is of the former.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So with no time to take your hands out of your pockets, you just left, nice and quietly, you say?
</p><p>Nash:<br />
That's right, guvnor. Nuffin' we 'ate more than violence. Peace-lovin' nibblers, we are, not bludgers.
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
We are, Nash, we are. Never even pulled me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...So, you'd clearly like us to believe...
</p><p>Nash:<br />
Eh? Come again...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As you fled from the pawnbroker's that night... ...did you not run into anyone else?
</p><p>Nash:<br />
Um...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And...did you not fire a gun at that person?!
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
Erm...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Saints alive! They fired a gun, you say?
</p><p>Nash:<br />
AAAAAAGH!!! Blimey, guvnor!
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
You ain't tellin' us it woz you in the doorway?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was.
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
......... Why the bleedin' Nora...
</p><p>Nash:<br />
...Didn't ya mention that before?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You were armed with a gun. And as you fled the scene, you fired that gun... ...at London's greatest detective, Herlock Sholmes!
</p>
<center>They shot the great Mr Sholmes?<br />
I did hear that, actually. There was a rumour he'd been rushed to hospital.<br />...The great Sholmes? That's beyond the pale!</center>
<p><br />
Van Zieks:<br />
On the night in question... ...this pair were arrested by the police within minutes of the discovery of the crime scene. ...Their suspicious countenance rapidly gave them away.
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
Hehe...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Judge:<br />
What is that? Explain!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's a photographic print taken at Windibank's pawnbrokery on the day of the incident.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
From the scene of the crime, is it? Is, is that... ...<span style="color:#E16935">a bullet hole</span>? And if my eyes do not deceive me, it appears the bullet is still lodged there.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, as Your Lordship noticed... ...the bullet pierced Mr Windibank's calendar. The date shown being the 16th of April - the very day of the pawnbroker's death.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The incident occurred at one hour after midnight. But this indicates that a separate shot had been fired sometime <span style="color:#E16935">after the calendar had been set</span> to the 16th!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right. And while it isn't irrefutable, the defence believes... ...this is credible evidence that the witnesses did fire a round from their gun in the pawnbroker's that night!
</p><p>Nash:<br />
NAAAAAAAAAH!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! ...How does the prosecution stand, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... If that is the direction my learned friend wishes to take, the prosecution has no objection.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But you'll forgive me for flinging my <span style="color:#E16935">hallowed chalice</span> aside in disgust at the repugnancy it exposes. Yes. On the night in question, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery illegally... ...and like the bold 'baddies' they claim to be, opened fire on the new arrivals before fleeing back onto the street!
</p><p>Nash:<br />
EEEEEEH?! Take it easy there, guvnor! Yer gonna land us in the soup!
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
We 'ad a deal! You weren't gonna get into them...details. Tell 'im, Sulky! Set the bloke straight!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
...I have nothin' to add.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So he knew, did he? Van Zieks knew their testimony would almost certainly expose the extent of their crimes.)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It would seem now... ...that I owe my learned Nipponese friend a word of gratitude. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What I mean...is that you have helpfully confirmed an important fact. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
To what fact do you refer, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As has been established, at the point of their arrest, a single shot had been fired from the brothers' gun. However, if that shot found its target in Mr Sholmes... ...then clearly these witnesses cannot be accused of the fatal shooting of the proprietor and victim.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
In other words...these two men... ...have <span style="color:#E16935">no material connection</span> to the murder of Mr Windibank at all!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(So that's it...)</span>
</p><p>Nash:<br />
That's it! We didn't 'ave nuffin' to do wiv it!
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
We didn't, Nash, we didn't! That's wot I reckon!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Your crimes include unlawful entry, intent to steal, perjury and - let us not forget - attempted murder.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Quite a catalogue, eh, fellas?
</p><p>Nash:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
We're in for it now, bruv...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Now then... ...let us take a moment to consider the aforementioned 'great detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes. It would seem the man patronised the pawnbroker's in question somewhat regularly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Where's he going with this?)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Mr Sholmes appears to take pleasure in tinkering with eccentric machinery.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
'Eccentric'? Says who?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Not me. Don't give me that look!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
He installed a pair of machines like this one in the victim's shop.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh! That's one of Hurley's 'Red-Handed Recorders'!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What is that, Counsel? It has the appearance of a photographic contraption.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As Your Lordship has surmised, it is indeed a camera attached to a small timing device.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Every half an hour, it automatically photographs the interior of the establishment. The idea being that if a thief were to break in to the shop, he would be caught red-handed.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution has obtained the photographs taken by the device on the night in question. As the court will observe, copious identical prints are produced in a quite desultory fashion.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph, rather prodigal, I feel.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
In fact there are <span style="color:#E16935">two</span> such devices in the victim's shop, My Lord. If I may refer the court to the plan of the premises, their respective positions are here...and here.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You say these cameras produce a print every half hour. I'm afraid I fail to see... ...how that would help if the anticipated thief conducted his activities in one of the many thirty-minute intervals.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
One can only pray that the would-be criminal lingers, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
On the night in question, the witnesses currently in the stand were not caught on camera.
</p><p>Nash:<br />
Hehe, that's a bit o' Friar Tuck, eh, bruv?
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
Lady Luck luvs a Skulkin!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Witnesses, at what time did your trespassing begin?
</p><p>Nash:<br />
Eh? ...Must've been just after one. ...Right, bruv?
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
Must've been, Nash, must've been. Yeah, just gone one.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
In which case, minutes before these brothers entered the establishment... ...what scene might we expect to see within the shop? Let us examine the evidence...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good Lord! It's...it's the defendant! Miss Gina Lestrade!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As the court can clearly see... ...the accused is pictured, gun in hand, facing the victim over the shop counter. No doubt coercing the proprietor to open the door to his storeroom.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Quite! One can only too easily imagine the events that unfolded. The court will take this photographic print as evidence, if you please, Counsel.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The photograph of Gina has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I, I don't believe it! Ginny...

In short... ...the accused is the only person who could possibly have killed Mr Windibank.

</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
......... Ah, you're that lawyer chap. Well, there's a turn-up for the books! Yes, rather a turbulent time we had back then.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Some extraordinary events took place at your house, that's for sure. Luckily Mr Sholmes and I were able to get to the bottom of it all.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I think we did rather a lot for you, didn't we?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I mean, obviously... ...I wouldn't be suggesting that therefore you should change your leaning to not guilty or anything!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
......... Hmph. Can't be denied, I suppose. The 'curse of the Garrideb house' was the talk of the town after that business. Lodgers moved out, and I couldn't get a bally soul to take up the tenancies.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Haven't had the heart to break the news to Joanie yet. Bad enough that the old girl's clapped up. Yes, can't be denied...you did do rather a lot. But not for us, that's for dashed certain.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I suppose not...

'Course... ...there can be no suggestion of that being the reason I'm leaning towards guilty here, obviously.

...Polishing the bench, I see...again.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
A maid's work is never done. Not a blemish must remain.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, what exactly do you mean by 'filthy eyesores'?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
On my way to market for His Lordship, I have to pass through the East End. The place is full of beggars, pickpurses and crossmen. The scum of the earth!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...A little harsh, perhaps.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Let me be plain... If it were up to me, all those back slums would be made spick and span or eradicated. At least we have people like the great detective working to achieve these important goals.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You're referring to Mr Herlock Sholmes?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
That's right. I like to keep abreast of his exploits by reading Randst Magazine in between my duties. He does wonders, cleaning up London's streets. In my opinion, he should be declared an honorary maid of the capital.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Mr Sholmes? ...A maid?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
It's really quite unforgivable... Gutter scum having the audacity to shoot our very greatest detective!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Minor detail: It was the two brothers in the stand who shot Mr Sholmes, not the defendant.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
A minor detail indeed. They're all gutter scum as far as I'm concerned!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Weeell...it just might be an idea to get our facts straight anyway...

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I agree with you. The shooting of Mr Sholmes was an unforgivable act. But the purpose of this trial is to determine who shot the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
...I'm afraid you're splitting hairs, sir.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Whether it was the thieves or the pickpurse... ...it was still gutter trash that shot the pawnbroker in the end. Filth that should be cleaned up and eradicated...in my considered opinion.

Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself!
</p><p>Juror No.2:<br />
Oh my! My statement? Contradictory?

Contradict... C-o-n...

Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...I do not have stick. I have mouse.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Sir?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
......... Forgive me. I did not hear.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! That's exactly right!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Enough! I trust no one now!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm afraid that won't be poss-
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes it is, Runo! Easily!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> the brothers' flight.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It would seem so, yes.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Good.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, not good.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, what exactly have you been muttering about all this time, sir? You keep talking about having left something somewhere or something like that.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Ah...so sorry. As you can probably tell, I'm <span style="color:#E16935">a surgeon</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A surgeon?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(That totally passed me by...)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Of course, people conducting surgery in this country aren't considered to be doctors. Oh no! Even though me and my kind are at the forefront of medical science! The real brains in the field!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...what is it that you think you've left behind?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Ah well, that's...a little embarrassing, to be honest. You see I was operating on someone yesterday. Standard thing - went in through the abdomen. But when I'd finished the procedure, I... Well, I couldn't find my scalpel anywhere.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Did he...? Surely not!)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Exactly! 'Surely not!' you say to yourself, don't you? Worrying, isn't it? That's what's been troubling me this whole time. Could I really have left my scalpel inside the fellow's belly? ...No, of course I couldn't! So...there you have it. Like I said, a little embarrassing, really.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That's one way of putting it. The other is manslaughter.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
That's exactly my concern! And seeing as this case appears to be all but sewn up... ...I need to focus on trying to remember exactly what I've sewn up elsewhere! Now...I'm sure I made sure everything was back as it should be. Well, as sure as you can be without being sure.

...Are you from the Far East? Stop.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, yes. From the Empire of Japan.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
All communication with Far Eastern nations used to take place by mail. Royal Mail steamers take more than a month to complete the journey.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah, but now we have the electric telegram. So we can send messages using electrical signals. Thousands of miles of cables have been laid along the ocean beds, connecting the entire world.

Thousands of miles of cable? ...On the ocean bed? <span style="color:#0070C0">(It makes my head hurt just thinking about it.)</span>

You are well informed, young lady.

<span style="color:#E16935">Radio transmission</span> is the future. Stop. Messages carried over airwaves to four corners of globe. Stop. Excitement growing! Stop. Atmosphere electric! Stop.

...I think he just might be, yes.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
You think stereoscopes are just toys, do you? Huh?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Absolutely. I mean, really! A machine to view photographs in three dimensions? Why on earth would you not just use your eyes to look at the world around you? It's all three-dimensional!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...What a great way to appease the man.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
No, I'm sorry. Stereoscopes are of no practical use at all.

......... You just don't know!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Pardon?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />

What sort of possibilities?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Well, take a crime scene, for example. If you had a pair of photographs from a crime scene that you could view through a stereoscope... ...it could <span style="color:#E16935">reveal hidden clues</span> you'd never even noticed before!

Oh dear, oh dear... Don't you have these in the Far East? Don't you know how a stereoscope works?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Runo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You need <span style="color:#E16935">two photographs</span> for a stereoscope, remember? You know, <span style="color:#E16935">one for the left</span> eye, and <span style="color:#E16935">one for the right</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, oh yes. I remember now. But the print we have from the pawnbrokery is just <span style="color:#E16935">a normal photograph</span>.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
No no no. I think you'll find... ...that the clue is in the name. It's a stereoscope, not a monoscope! You always need two prints!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Thanks for the friendly explanation.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hmmm... Well, if we obtain <span style="color:#E16935">another print</span> at some point later in the trial... ...we can always show it to this young man then.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Hahaha!

</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
To be treated like wicious criminal all the time... It is wery painful. People do not realise. So I have much sympathies for these brothers. People say they are criminals only because of how they look.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The Skulkin brothers?

Those two statements clearly contradict each other!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself!
</p><p>Juror No.2:<br />
Oh my! My statement? Contradictory?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Contradict... C-o-n...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...I do not have stick. I have mouse.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Sir?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
......... Forgive me. I did not hear.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! That's exactly right!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Enough! I trust no one now!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm afraid that won't be poss-
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes it is, Runo! Easily!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> the brothers' flight.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It would seem so, yes.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Good.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, not good.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Yes, I see. Tell me, Mr, um...lawyer. Do you know how stereographic images work? Do you understand the principle?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...I think so... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I did have a lesson only yesterday...)</span> The left and right eye images need to be the same, only with a slight <span style="color:#E16935">shift</span> in the positions of some objects. Then when your brain <span style="color:#E16935">merges</span> the two images together inside your head, it notices <span style="color:#E16935">the shift</span> as if it were depth.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Yes, exactly.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It's that small <span style="color:#E16935">shift</span> between certain objects in the two pictures that's really important.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So what happens if you use two photographs that are <span style="color:#E16935">exactly the same</span>, then?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
No no, obviously that wouldn't work at all. Not for seeing the scene three-dimensionally, anyway.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh... OOOOOOH! Of course! Now I see!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Ah! I think the young girl has discovered the secret!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I have, I have!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Can you uncross your eyes before you tell me?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Have another look at these two pictures from Hurley's camera, Runo! Go on! Can you see that there's a really obvious <span style="color:#E16935">difference</span> between them?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Of course there is! There are <span style="color:#E16935">two people</span> in the first, and <span style="color:#E16935">no people</span> in the second!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well yes, you can see that straight away. But now... ...try looking at the pictures <span style="color:#E16935">in three dimensions</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright, I'll, I'll give it a go. <span style="color:#0070C0">(So, to start with... ...you have to <span style="color:#E16935">cross your eyes</span>, and then try to make the two pictures <span style="color:#E16935">overlap</span> exactly.)</span> ........................... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Let's see if by crossing my eyes I can make the quill pens from each picture overlap in the middle...)</span> ........................... <span style="color:#0070C0">(...Wait...)</span>

Agh! What's, what's going on with these two pictures? Some of the things on the counter sort of... They sort of <span style="color:#E16935">jump out</span> at you!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Yes yes yes! That's it, you see! That's the other amazing power of stereoscopes!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
O-Other amazing power?!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Is someone going to explain this...black magic, eh? Why the deuce do some of the things on the counter seem to <span style="color:#E16935">jump out</span> at you like that, hm?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
I think you'll find that if you consider the basic principle of the stereoscope, you'll answer your own question.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Basic principles...of the stereoscope...?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
As I said before... ...if you try to look at two identical pictures using a stereoscope, it won't work at all. It's the slight <span style="color:#E16935">shift</span> in the positions of certain objects that lets you see pictures three-dimensionally.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...In other words... ...even though at first glance it seems the objects on the counter haven't moved at all between the two pictures... ...this shows that actually...there must have been a slight <span style="color:#E16935">shift</span> in their positions!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, there must have been.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Now hold fire there, sir! Got a reasonable grasp of this whole cross-eyed business now, I'd say. But why the devil does this <span style="color:#E16935">shift</span> between the two prints exist in the first place? Well? What's the answer, fellow? Come on, you're the cross-eyed master!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? Me? <span style="color:#0070C0">(I haven't the first idea!)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You know, Runo! It's quite simple.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It, it is?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Just think it through step by step. The first photograph was taken at 1:00 a.m. Then, thirty minutes later...the second photograph was taken. But the position of some items on the counter appears to have shifted slightly in the interim. So that means...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That means that sometime in the half hour interval... ...someone must have <span style="color:#E16935">tampered</span> with the things on the counter!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Zookers!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Someone tampered...?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
New information! Stop. Not mentioned in testimony so far! Stop.

The question now is clear. We know the items on the countertop were moved. ...But by whom?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />

Of course. <span style="color:green">I can tell you right now who is responsible for the almost imperceptible shift in the items on the counter!</span>

Quite clearly it was the work...of this meddler!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... I'm afraid you've digressed there, Counsel.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It should now be clear even to you... ...who is responsible for the impeachable shift in the direction of this trial...toward the absurd.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Let me guess... ...Me?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Shift aside, my Nipponese friend, and let the real lawyers do the talking!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Uargh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I really felt that one...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
If you think about it... ...it has to have been someone who was in Windibank's when everything was going on, doesn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...yes, that's true.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So... ...that narrows it down quite a lot, I think.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Wait! This does not agree with what brothers said in testimony before. They said they did not even have time to pull 'dukes' from 'Lucy Lockets'. My phrasebook says 'dukes' is meaning 'hands' and 'Lucy Lockets' is meaning 'pockets'. But is this...another lie?! Is this what you are saying?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I'm afraid so.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Now hold on there a minute! You can't be sure of that.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
I quite agree. The accused is a common pickpurse, after all. It's perfectly possible that she went through the things on the desk to see what she might steal.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I think...that's unlikely.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
And why, exactly?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...As you can see from...this photographic print, the defendant was pointing a gun at the victim. It would seem, as my learned friend indicated, that she was coercing Mr Windibank to open the storeroom door. In other words, Miss Lestrade's interests lay <span style="color:#E16935">within</span> the storeroom, not in the main shop... ...giving her no reason to touch anything on the counter. All of which points to one thing! The Skulkin brothers have <span style="color:#E16935">omitted key facts</span> in their testimony!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
...! But the accused is a pickpurse! Common gutter trash! Why look any further for the wrongdoer here?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Because the Skulkin brothers are thieves, madam. No better - in fact worse - than a pickpurse.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I believe that these brothers were <span style="color:#E16935">looking for something</span> on the victim's counter that night.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you would condemn the defendant on the grounds that she's a pickpocket... ...would it not at least be right and proper to thoroughly scrutinise testimony given against her by two thieves?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
...Well said.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
I for one would like to hear more from that shady pair!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Can you all see now? I think you'll find stereoscopes aren't playthings! You've seen their extraordinary potential firsthand!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Wholeheartedly agree! Stop. Must purchase after trial. Stop. Will return home via Regent Street. Stop.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well...it would seem this trial has yet to run its course. The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have declared their inclinations via the mighty Scales of Justice. I hereby call this summation examination to conclusion with the balance altered in the defendant's favour. Two lean to guilty. Four lean to not guilty. Accordingly, the jury is without consensus... ...and I order this trial to continue.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yay! Well done! ...Oh, by the way...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You should hold onto this, Runo. You never know when it might come in useful!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Twice in one trial would be unusual, surely? But alright.)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The stereoscope has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Lord van Zieks... ...you will instruct the witnesses that the court demands additional testimony from them.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(From <span style="color:#E16935">the storeroom</span>, where the victim was found dead...)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

On 'is granny's life! 'Course it woz!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...that would mean... ...that you both <span style="color:#E16935">knew</span> Mr Windibank and the sound of his voice?

Eh? So that would mean...wot?!
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
Wot, Nash, wot? ...Any ideas?

Yes, Counsel, indeed it would.

</p><p>Ringo:<br />
Didn't really sound like 'e meant it, mind. More of an empty threat, ya could say.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Mr Windibank was known to keep a revolver on his shop counter at all times. People say that to protect the articles in his keeping, he'd readily put a bullet in someone's head if required. ...That someone being himself, of course.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
According to their testimony... ...the witnesses claim to have heard a shout of 'Give me that gun!' followed by the gunshot.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed. With the two events happening <span style="color:#E16935">almost simultaneously</span>, or so we've been led to believe.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, that's right. Now, if that testimony is true... ...it would mean that at the moment of death, the victim and his attacker would have been <span style="color:#E16935">facing each other</span>. However...if I could ask the court to study the photograph of the victim's body again... ...you can clearly see that Mr Windibank was in fact <span style="color:#E16935">shot from behind</span>.

Ladies and gentlemen, you have all just heard the admission by these two witnesses... ...that on the night in question, they actually saw, with their own eyes, the victim wielding a gun.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
When you say 'geezer', I presume you mean the victim and proprietor of the shop, Mr Windibank?
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
Who else- ...Sorry, I mean, that's right!
</p><p>Nash:<br />
We woz keepin' a close eye on the entrance to the gaff, obviously. But we never thought no one woz gonna come outta the back room like that!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The back room being the pawnbrokery's storeroom?
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
Yeah, that must be where 'e popped up from. Only place 'e could've been.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So it would seem the victim was already in the storeroom when these brothers entered the premises.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Which means...Ginny must have been in there at that point as well.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But that doesn't make sense...does it? If Gina had threatened Mr Windibank into the storeroom with her at gunpoint... ...then why would he have emerged from the same room all alone when the brothers arrived?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, I...don't know...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Did you see the accused at that time?

At the time in question, the alarm was raised at the local police station via a secret cable from the pawnbrokery. There is <span style="color:#E16935">a button</span> under the counter used to activate it, which was presumably pressed by the victim.

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What is your point...my learned friend?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The question we must answer is who could have shot Mr Windibank. And it is the belief of the defence that the defendant is not the only possible answer at all.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You have my attention. In that case...let us return to this plan of the premises. The victim was killed in the storeroom, which was locked from the inside. Those are the facts. So pray...what other possible answer to the question of who shot the man could there be?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Counsel... ...you must now provide answers to the court in respect of <span style="color:#E16935">two conundrums</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Two...My Lord? <span style="color:#0070C0">(...Twice as many chances to be right, maybe?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed. Namely... ...from what location did the culprit shoot the victim? And furthermore... ...where was the victim at the time?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Understood, My Lord.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Are you alright, Runo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm not entirely sure. But there's one thing I am sure about. If I can prove that there's a credible <span style="color:#E16935">new alternative</span> to what happened... ...it would change Gina's prospects hugely!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So now...time for some clarity. Show the court on this plan the answers to the questions posed by His Lordship. <span style="color:green">If you believe someone else could have killed the victim, indicate from where that person could have fired the gun!</span>

</p><p>Iris:<br />
They're still hiding something, don't you think?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I'm sure of it. And not just a minor detail, either.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It was almost certainly because of these two that poor Mr Windibank...well... You can't let them get away with it, Runo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I know. <span style="color:#0070C0">(But I get the feeling... ...that there's even less evidence at my disposal this time to prove that they did it.)</span>

Well, I'll do my best.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The culprit shot the victim <span style="color:#E16935">from outside</span> the storeroom!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Continue.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Windibank died instantly from a bullet wound in his back. Looking at the stain of blood on the storeroom floor, it doesn't appear that the body was moved after death. Which tells us that he was almost certainly shot while he was in the storeroom. However, the crucial point is, <span style="color:#E16935">where was the shooter</span> when the fatal bullet was fired?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So you are adamant...that the shot was fired from outside the storeroom?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, according to the Skulkin brothers' earlier testimony...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Nash:<br />
I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If Mr Windibank ran away through the door... ...we have to assume that the door was <span style="color:#E16935">open</span> at the time.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was at precisely that moment, when the victim was fleeing for his life... ...that these brothers had the perfect opportunity to shoot the man in the back once he was inside the storeroom!
</p><p>NAAAAAAAAAGH!
</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">GAAAAAAAAAGH!</div>
<p><br />
Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Come to think of it...do you remember what the prosecutor said at the start of the trial?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
Moving on to the findings of Scotland Yard's coroner... His report states that the bullet entered the body on <span style="color:#E16935">a rising diagonal trajectory</span>.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
It means...the victim was likely shot by someone significantly <span style="color:#E16935">shorter in height</span> than himself.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Iris:<br />
Poor man... Shot while he was running as fast as he could to safety...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! Of course! He would have been <span style="color:#E16935">leaning forward</span> as he was running away. So even if the bullet was fired horizontally, it would still have entered his body on <span style="color:#E16935">an upward trajectory</span>!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So the culprit isn't necessarily someone shorter than Mr Windibank!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I'm sure my learned friend can't have forgotten... ...that the storeroom door was found closed, and...<span style="color:#E16935">locked from the inside</span>. You claim the victim was shot as he fled into the room. Do you also claim his corpse was dexterous enough to turn the key in the lock?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh! But...but... ...what if someone else locked the door? Yes! There is someone else who could have locked the storeroom door!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Is that so?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well then, Counsel. Present your hypothesis to the court. In the scenario just described... ...the defence's assertion is that the victim was shot from outside the storeroom. <span style="color:green">In which case, who shut and locked the storeroom door from the inside?</span>

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
That's absurd! You're suggesting that the accused deliberately engineered the sealed room? For what possible reason?! Such actions would only serve to tighten the noose around her neck!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I am inclined to agree, I must say. ...Well, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Ah...yes...that's a tricky one, that...isn't it?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Half-baked notions have no place in my courtroom, Counsel. Remember that, please.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But of course Ginny would have locked the door. It almost goes without saying, doesn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It, it does?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well if I was Ginny in that situation... ...I know I would have locked the door. As quickly as I could! I mean... ...those two burglars had just <span style="color:#E16935">fired a gun</span> in her direction, hadn't they?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh yes! Obviously...)</span> Before the two brothers arrived, Miss Lestrade and Mr Windibank were in the storeroom together. Now...I don't know what went on between them at that time, but at some point... ...Mr Windibank must have heard the intruders breaking into his shop, and left the storeroom.
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
Intruders, eh? ...That's us, bruv!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If your theory is correct, that would leave the accused alone in the storeroom.

...Yes, it would. Then, probably only moments later, the victim fled back through the storeroom door hoping to escape danger.

Ah! I, I see where yer goin' wiv this!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's blatantly untrue! I know for a fact that you would. Because before my own eyes...you shot Mr Herlock Sholmes!
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
...!
</p><p>Nash:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There is only one logical conclusion here. Mr and Mr Skulkin, you brothers had every opportunity... ...to have been <span style="color:#E16935">the true perpetrators</span> of Mr Windibank's murder!
</p><p>Nash:<br />
Ah...em...um...
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
Erm...em...ugh...
</p><p>NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!</div>
<p><br />
Where, where does this leave us?<br />
You mean to say it wasn't the pickpocket who shot the pawnbroker after all?<br />
I should have known it was those three brothers! They look as shady as a dense forest!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That was amazing, Runo! All the members of the jury seem to be firmly on your side now!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I know! <span style="color:#E16935">First time ever</span>! And <span style="color:#E16935">probably the last</span>...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, I think you've done it! Surely they'll have to give a verdict of not-
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Keh...heh...heh... An admirable effort...my learned friend.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(What's this now? He's laughing?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You find the situation amusing, Lord van Zieks? I myself find the defence's argument most persuasive. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I dare say... ...such chicanery is the bread and butter of the street performers in your provincial Eastern nation. But such blatantly malicious <span style="color:#E16935">conjuring tricks</span> amount to nothing more than inexcusable pettifoggery here.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The hypothesis you put forward so ostensibly credibly cannot, and will not stand. Because, you see, it contains a fatal <span style="color:#E16935">flaw</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A, a fatal flaw?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Do you mean to tell me that you're unaware of your logic's failing?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
I say! Lord van Zieks... Might be an idea to explain this bally conjuring trick or whatever it is to the troops on the ground, hm?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The fatal flaw in my learned friend's argument is really very simple to understand... ...assuming you're not too dim-witted to <span style="color:#E16935">count bullets</span>!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
By George! Count bullets?!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh dear... ...he noticed then.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh? <span style="color:#0070C0">(What's everyone talking about?)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Counsel!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Y-Yes, sir?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Tell the court, how many bullets were found at the scene of the crime?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...two. Two bullets.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Correct. The first, that which hit the victim in the back, ending his life. And the second, that which struck the 'detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes, on his arrival at the scene.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed. The defence presented a picture showing the damage caused by <span style="color:#E16935">the second bullet</span> earlier in the proceedings. The bullet which injured Mr Sholmes appears to have passed through his body to strike <span style="color:#E16935">the calendar</span>.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Your Lordship's understanding is correct. Furthermore, we know there are <span style="color:#E16935">two firearms</span> involved in the incident. The revolver belonging to the victim, Mr Windibank... ...and the Skulkin brothers' revolver. The evidence shows that <span style="color:#E16935">a single bullet was fired from each</span> gun.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes! Indeed it does! A single bullet from each!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Now then, my learned friend...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You yourself told the court only moments ago... ...that these two brothers shot Mr Herlock Sholmes <span style="color:#E16935">right before your eyes</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I, I did!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Oh my goodness! I, I think you'll find...
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
That if the single bullet that was fired from the brothers' gun hit Mr Sholmes, it means...
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Windibank <span style="color:#E16935">not shot by same gun</span>! Stop. Only one bullet! Stop.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Exactly. Yes, this Nipponese street performer presented an ostensibly credible argument. ...However! It was never anything more than a diversionary trick with <span style="color:#E16935">no hope</span> of standing up to scrutiny!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh............ UWAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Pray forgive the discourtesy of flinging the dregs of this hallowed nectar into the public gallery...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
L-Lord van Zieks!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...but this court needs to open its eyes. The accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, is no ordinary little girl. Despite her young years, she can, regrettably, no longer be described as a juvenile. No, the person in the dock is far from a law-abiding citizen. She has a past riddled with <span style="color:#E16935">criminal conduct</span>!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The truth is, the accused broke into the pawnbrokery on the night in question with loathsome intent... ...as we can see beyond doubt in this print which depicts her threatening the victim with the murder weapon!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And I have here in my possession one more piece of evidence the prosecution wishes to present.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(That disk!)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gregson:<br />
I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, that music box disk... McGilded's music box disk...)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The very day before the hateful murder of Mr Windibank... ...the accused attempted to make off with this article, which clearly doesn't belong to her. And with none of the subtlety of a pickpocket, I might add. But by brute force and brazen impudence.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Make no mistake! Any sympathy for the accused on account of her years is misguided and dangerous! There are no depths to which this girl would not stoop if pushed. No crime she would not commit. ...The court forgets that fact at its peril.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm...I see... I think it would be prudent to take this music box disk into evidence, Counsel. As a grim testament to the defendant's character.

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Yes, Inspector?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
We had a meetin' yesterday at the Yard with the prosecution service, and, um... ...I, I think it was agreed that that disk <span style="color:#E16935">wouldn't be used as evidence</span>.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I am unaware of any such meeting.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
But! But those were the instructions, right from the top. The government bigwigs were insistent!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Inspector, I am the prosecutor, and I alone determine how to present my case. Your warning is noted. ...Thank you.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution wishes to proceed with submitting this disk as evidence, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In-Indeed. Bailiff!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The music box disk has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution has established the accused's <span style="color:#E16935">motive</span>, <span style="color:#E16935">opportunity</span> and <span style="color:#E16935">baseness of character</span>. There is nothing more to add. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I await your informed decisions...and rest my case.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Would you please stop muttering about things that have nothing to do with this trial, sir? The defendant's life is on the line here!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Hm, well, the thing is... ...I couldn't really say that it is nothing to do with this trial, to be honest.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
I mean, there's no question that the man was shot, but the bullet had simply <span style="color:#E16935">vanished from his stomach</span>. It's quite inexplicable. ...Don't you think?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I almost don't want to ask, but this <span style="color:#E16935">surgery</span> you've been muttering about all this time. You were operating on...
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
What was the fellow's name now? Herr Lich? ...No. Herr Loch? ...No. Hairlock?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Herlock Sholmes by any chance?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Yes! Good Lord! It was that Hairlock fellow!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
WHAAAT?! You're, you're the surgeon that operated on Mr Sholmes?!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
That's right. Using the very latest anaesthesia techniques, I might add! It was a fairly major op, I can tell you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is crazy!)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Let me see, the fellow was brought in not long after midnight, if I remember correctly. They said he'd been shot by some criminal or other. So I opened him up like a shot. But the funny thing is, I went over his insides with a fine-tooth comb, and couldn't find the bullet anywhere. So I'm afraid I had to throw up my hands and just stitch the fellow back up.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I hate to state the obvious, but...
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...surely that's because the bullet is still <span style="color:#E16935">at the scene</span> of the shooting!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The counsel for the defence is correct. As is clearly shown in this photographic print.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The bullet that the Skulkin brothers fired at Mr Sholmes hit him in the stomach region... ...then exited his body and lodged into the shop wall where the calendar was hanging by the door. I think you'll find it's really quite simple if you just consider the problem three-dimensionally.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Hah! Who do you think I am, son?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Um, well, 'juror number four' is about the best I can do.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
As soon as I saw the wound to the man's stomach, I flipped him over.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Like a pancake? Are, are you saying that you checked his back?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Of course I did! And there wasn't a trace of injury. No sign that the bullet had <span style="color:#E16935">left the body</span> at all!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
That's the point! The only logical conclusion was that the bullet was still somewhere in the man's innards! Which is exactly why I set about slicing him up! And I'm still none the wiser, even now! How many times do I have to say it? Can somebody please explain how it happened? Can somebody please solve the mystery!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...It's almost as much of a mystery as how this jury was put together.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Sholmes's surgeon is on the jury...? I've experienced some coincidences recently, but this is ridiculous.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
I'm as surprised as anyone!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But there's no question that Mr Sholmes was shot?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Well, that's what the police told me when they brought him in.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...How bad were his injuries, doctor?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
He was in a bad way. He'd lost a huge amount of blood, you know. And I suspect he was shot at quite <span style="color:#E16935">close range</span>, too. Because his skin was badly burnt around the point of entry.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Burnt?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
As I said, I flipped the fellow over and examined his back, but there was no sign of an exit wound. Which is why I thought I'd better locate the lug and pop it out.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And yet you say you found no bullet inside the patient?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Well I wouldn't have done, would I? Because it's in the wall of the pawnbroker's. But how did it get there?! I need someone to solve this mystery before it drives me to insanity! If only there were some expert in ballistics who could help! Even if he looked extremely <span style="color:#E16935">untrustworthy</span>!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Those two statements clearly contradict...the idea that all I do is pit jurors against each other!

Ooh! A ballistics expert!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
'Pitting'... 'P-i-t-t-...'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
On the night in question, Mr Sholmes was shot by one of the Skulkin brothers. But since there was no sign of an exit wound on his back, we must assume the bullet didn't pass through him. However, no bullet was found lodged in Mr Sholmes's body, either. Furthermore... ...a bullet was found lodged in the wall of the shop where Mr Sholmes was shot. Juror number six...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
'Hello. My name is Vilen. Pleased to meet you.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This apparent contradiction in the facts that is so clearly troubling juror number four... Are you able to explain the mystery?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
......... I have seen wery similar situation in motherland.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
It was night. There was blizzard. I was running away long mountain round in freezing cold.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Golly.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
The snow was piling high on both sides of road. It was wery narrow and dangerous. My pursuers had hunting rifles and they were on dog sleds.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Mental note: don't ask too many questions.)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I was shot from behind, and I fell down in snow. And this situation was wery similar to what I hear today from doctor. They could not find bullet in my body. And no sign of - how do you say? - exit wound.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Then, then where did the bullet go?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Bullet never hit me.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Well if it never hit you, why did you fall down?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Bullet hit frozen <span style="color:#E16935">wall of ice</span> wery close to my side.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
One small piece - wery sharp - broke away from lump of ice and pierced my body. It made deep wound that looks just like bullet wound.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Good gracious...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Of course, piece of ice quickly melted inside me. And that is solution to mystery of disappearing bullet.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
.........
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
But, but that doesn't answer the question at all!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
The shooting happened in a pawnbroker's shop... ...not some snowy mountain road in another country!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... ...Just an idea, but we might not be looking at EXACTLY the same scenario here.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Runo... ...where exactly was Hurley shot again?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, well, according to the report, in his stomach. Sort of around this area, I think.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well...that's precisely where he always wears a little <span style="color:#E16935">pouch</span> on his belt.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A pouch? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Actually, I might have noticed something like that.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three <span style="color:#E16935">glass phials</span> of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Really?)</span> Doctor! Where is the pouch Mr Sholmes was wearing?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Hm, well... ...the fellow had nothing like that on his person when he arrived at the hospital as far as I remember.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If I may...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Lord van Zieks...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
While I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Ah! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Since then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed.
</p>
<center>Bring forth Mr Herlock Sholmes's pouch!</center>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Hm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Look at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Exploded?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
And it was the glass phial <span style="color:#E16935">exploding</span> that caused the fellow's injury!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
The bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... ...A delightfully complex aroma.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Though it has no bearing on the truth of this case.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The bungling and burgling brothers shot the detective, and the accused shot the pawnbroker. The pertinent facts of the case remain unaltered.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
But at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...Da. 'Thank you wery much.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Glad I could help.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Due to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hurley's pouch isn't scruffy!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Sholmes's pouch has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, the summation examination... It would appear the defence is somewhat struggling to alter opinion, hm?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Please, My Lord! A little more time. <span style="color:#0070C0">(After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!)</span>

'Pitting'... 'P-i-t-t-...'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
On the night in question, Mr Sholmes was shot by one of the Skulkin brothers. But since there was no sign of an exit wound on his back, we must assume the bullet didn't pass through him. However, no bullet was found lodged in Mr Sholmes's body, either. Furthermore... ...a bullet was found lodged in the wall of the shop where Mr Sholmes was shot. Juror number six...

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This apparent contradiction in the facts that is so clearly troubling juror number four... Are you able to explain the mystery?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
......... I have seen wery similar situation in motherland.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
It was night. There was blizzard. I was running away long mountain round in freezing cold.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Golly.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
The snow was piling high on both sides of road. It was wery narrow and dangerous. My pursuers had hunting rifles and they were on dog sleds.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Mental note: don't ask too many questions.)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I was shot from behind, and I fell down in snow. And this situation was wery similar to what I hear today from doctor. They could not find bullet in my body. And no sign of - how do you say? - exit wound.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Then, then where did the bullet go?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Bullet never hit me.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Well if it never hit you, why did you fall down?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Bullet hit frozen <span style="color:#E16935">wall of ice</span> wery close to my side.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
One small piece - wery sharp - broke away from lump of ice and pierced my body. It made deep wound that looks just like bullet wound.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Good gracious...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Of course, piece of ice quickly melted inside me. And that is solution to mystery of disappearing bullet.

</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
But, but that doesn't answer the question at all!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
The shooting happened in a pawnbroker's shop... ...not some snowy mountain road in another country!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... ...Just an idea, but we might not be looking at EXACTLY the same scenario here.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Runo... ...where exactly was Hurley shot again?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, well, according to the report, in his stomach. Sort of around this area, I think.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well...that's precisely where he always wears a little <span style="color:#E16935">pouch</span> on his belt.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A pouch? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Actually, I might have noticed something like that.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three <span style="color:#E16935">glass phials</span> of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Really?)</span> Doctor! Where is the pouch Mr Sholmes was wearing?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Hm, well... ...the fellow had nothing like that on his person when he arrived at the hospital as far as I remember.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If I may...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Lord van Zieks...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
While I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Ah! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Since then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed.
</p>
<center>Bring forth Mr Herlock Sholmes's pouch!</center>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Hm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Look at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Exploded?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
And it was the glass phial <span style="color:#E16935">exploding</span> that caused the fellow's injury!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
The bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... ...A delightfully complex aroma.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Though it has no bearing on the truth of this case.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The bungling and burgling brothers shot the detective, and the accused shot the pawnbroker. The pertinent facts of the case remain unaltered.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
But at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...Da. 'Thank you wery much.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Glad I could help.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Due to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hurley's pouch isn't scruffy!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Sholmes's pouch has been entered into the Court Record.</span>

Please, My Lord! A little more time. <span style="color:#0070C0">(After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!)</span>

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What is this new trickery, you Nipponese conjurer?! Where did you find that bullet?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was lodged inside Mr Sholmes's pouch.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This pouch was removed from around Mr Sholmes's waist before he was taken to hospital. And since then, it has been touched by no one.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Do, do you mean to say... ...the shot fired by the Skulkin brothers that night...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. As your Lordship has surmised...it hit this pouch.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But that makes no sense whatsoever! We already know the whereabouts of the bullet fired at Mr Sholmes. It's clearly visible in this photographic print!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Two guns from the scene have already been submitted into the Court Record as evidence.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes. That of Mr Windibank, and that belonging to the Skulkin brothers.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And examination of both guns revealed... ...that <span style="color:#E16935">only a single bullet had been fired from each</span>.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
But, but that must mean...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right. We now know that on the night in question, <span style="color:#E16935">three bullets</span> were fired. However! Only two bullets were fired from the guns recovered from the crime scene! And until that incontrovertible inconsistency is somehow explained... ...we cannot and must not pass judgement!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Agk......... AAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! While this summation examination remains incomplete, the court has been presented with new facts. Facts that would appear to shake the very foundations upon which the case against the defendant has been built.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
As is my prerogative in this situation... ...I hereby temporarily <span style="color:#E16935">suspend</span> the summation examination.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
By Jupiter!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Bailiff! Bring the witnesses back to the stand at once!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Witnesses...
</p><p>Nash:<br />
Guvnor!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Were you listening to proceedings while the defence carried out the summation examination?
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
We woz, guvnor, we woz!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Perhaps we can dispense with the tedious preamble. Simply answer this one question: A third bullet has been identified at the scene of the crime. ...What do you make of that?
</p><p>Nash:<br />
Make of it, guv? I dun't make nuffin' of nuffin' if I can 'elp it. Um...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Is it one of yours?
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
Gorblimey, guv, gorblimey! Not a chance!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
In that case...did you have an accomplice?
</p><p>Nash:<br />
Wot?! Eh? Wot?! Never! The Skulkin bruvvers work alone!
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
It's just the two of us! That's our trademark!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...How soon we forget poor Sulky...)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Only two of the bullets from the crime scene originated from the firearms we have in evidence. <span style="color:#E16935">The third bullet</span> was fired from another gun. ...Where is it?
</p><p>Nash:<br />
Lummy...that's an 'ead-scratcher... .........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... Counsel for the Defence...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Y-Yes?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I should like to hear your thoughts regarding these new developments. The third bullet...and the mysterious missing firearm from whence it came.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Thinking back over all the testimony we've heard and all the evidence we've seen... ...I think I'm starting to form a picture. A picture of <span style="color:#E16935">what really happened</span> that night.)</span> <span style="color:green">My Lord, I think it's clear what this third bullet tells us about the Skulkin brothers:</span>

What am I looking at here? There appears to be some green paint or suchlike around the bullet hole in the middle of the calendar.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's a bloodstain, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A bloodstain?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Green blood? Curious, even for you. Is the court to understand that the intruder was some unhuman creature?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's...something developed by Mr Herlock Sholmes.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
By the great detective!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
New invention! Stop. Not yet appeared in stories! Stop.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It's this, you see. It...doesn't have a name yet, though. This fogger sprays a chemical that reacts with the different elements in people's blood to change its colour.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Different elements...of people's blood...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes. Everyone's blood is slightly different, you see. Because it's made up of different elements. So by seeing what colour it changes to, you can tell in a flash whose blood it is!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Ooh! That brings a whole extra dimension to looking at blood!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />

As an example, this one shows the blood of the victim, Mr Windibank.

Ah... A striking blue.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. So you see, the green colour of this bloodstain on the calendar... ...shows that somebody else was <span style="color:#E16935">shot</span> in the main part of the shop!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Now hold fire there, young man! Could be from some unrelated incident, couldn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No. It's not unrelated.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...!

The date showing on the calendar is the date on which Mr Windibank was killed.

Therefore we can assume that whoever was shot, was shot on the same day.

The man's name...is Eggert Benedict.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Eggert Benedict?! Who on earth are you talking about, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He paid a visit to Windibank's pawnbrokery on the afternoon before the incident took place.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
When the accused attempted to deceive the pawnbroker into releasing this article into her possession.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That's right.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The man identified by the defence, Mr Eggert Benedict... ...then attempted to take the article from the defendant by force.
</p>
<hr />
<p>???:<br />
Broker!
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
Um, yes, sir?
</p><p>???:<br />
I believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemed an article from you, no?
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
Yes, yes, erm...
</p><p>???:<br />
The article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Now that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull?
</p><p>???:<br />
Give me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box <span style="color:#E16935">disks</span>, too.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Inspector Gregson was there at the time, and can attest to what happened. In the end, it was the inspector himself who took the disk.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Can you corroborate this account, Inspector?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Erm, yes, My Lord. That's more or less what happened. And in the interests of bein' thorough, I asked Windibank for a print showin' the fellow. Taken from one of his 'Red-Handed Recorder' gubbinses.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes! That's him talking to Mr Windibank that morning.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And you claim this man is the brothers' accomplice?

Well, Mr and Mr Skulkin?

......... Never seen the geezer before in me life!
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
On me life, guv, on me life! Never seen 'im!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well...somewhat unsurprisingly, it appears our witnesses disagree with the assertion.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I'm sure Your Lordship recalls my learned Nipponese friend's actual assertion. Which was that he could <span style="color:#E16935">prove</span> the identity of the alleged accomplice.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, and I can!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Then show us the evidence!

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Are you ready to present your answer to the court then, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord. The defence will present the evidence now. <span style="color:green">Proof that the man pictured in this photographic print was in fact the person struck by the third bullet!</span>

Ah.

You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen.

AAARGH! <span style="color:#0070C0">(It has to be a sample that links the bloodstain at the scene to Mr Benedict...)</span>

As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question... ...the defendant attempted - deceitfully, admittedly - to reclaim this disk from Windibank's.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Which is when the aforementioned Eggert Benedict appeared on the scene, I believe. This man then attempted to purloin the article from the defendant's possession, no?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's correct, My Lord. I myself was present at the time. It was following this that a minor incident occurred.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Windibank:<br />
But of course, sir. Here is <span style="color:#E16935">the disk</span> for you.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine!
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Being a music box disk, it has countless <span style="color:#E16935">small but sharp metal protrusions</span> over its surface. Those protrusions caused Mr Benedict's finger to bleed. And the resulting smear of blood is still visible on the disk now.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Goodness! A bloodstain, is it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My assistant and I have just analysed the bloodstain here in this very courtroom.

</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hm... I'm just remembering what Father Christmas over there said before. About how he was temporarily <span style="color:#E16935">suspending</span> the summation examination.

Yes! <span style="color:#0070C0">(She's right!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Young lady, you have quite the devious mind!

It really just comes down to one thing: Whether these ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...are convinced by what you say, Runo! ...Is that about right, would you say? Or did I misunderstand something?

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My Lord, with all due respect, this is an outrage! The prosecution refuses to accept this decision!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...On what grounds?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If these jurors are persuaded by some half-baked concoction devised by a pretender to real police work... ...then they are too ignorant to be trusted with the judgement of anyone's guilt.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I'm sorry, Lord van Zieks, but the outcome of the summation examination cannot be ignored. This trial will continue!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Agk......... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Nevertheless, we find ourselves in a rather awkward situation. The defence has very reasonably requested the subpoena of a new witness. But sadly, I fear that will be impossible.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The name the gentleman gave for himself - Eggert Benedict - is quite clearly false.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't believe it! Just when I'd managed to prove the man was there that night...)</span>
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>...Um... Could, could I say something?</center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
...? Who was that, please? Who spoke?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Um...it was me, My Lord.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Juror number five...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What have you to say, madam?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
If possible...Inspector...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Eh? ...Me, ma'am?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
I wonder if you might show the photographic print to me again? The one in which the gentleman is shown.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Ah, right, yes. This one, you mean? Of Mr Benedict?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
......... ......... .........Yes... There's no doubt in my mind.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Juror number five, you don't mean to say... You <span style="color:#E16935">know</span> this man?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Yes, I know him.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
No!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
GOOD GRACIOUS!!! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Juror number five! How on earth...?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
I am a communications officer. Stop.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...As we can clearly see...
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
The gentleman in the photograph is... Stop. ...also <span style="color:#E16935">a communications officer</span>. Stop. He works in my office. Stop. A very talented operator in fact! Stop. He should be in the communication station now. Stop. Tapping away on the telegraph. Stop.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This doesn't seem right somehow... I can't put my finger on why, but...it doesn't feel right.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hm... I suppose we all imagined the accomplice would be some sort of hardened criminal. It's...a bit unexpected to find out that he has a respectable job by day, whatever he gets up to at night.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...I suppose that's it. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I suppose that's why I felt something was wrong...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If the gentleman is at London's communication station, we should be able to subpoena him within the hour. Lord van Zieks, if you please...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Yes, My Lord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Make the necessary arrangements with all haste!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As Your Lordship bids.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The court will recess for one hour. When the new witness arrives, we shall reconvene to hear the gentleman's testimony. Inspector Gregson...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes, My Lord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I should like to hear from you specifically about events at the pawnbrokery on the day in question. Come to my chambers during the recess.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes, sir, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well... Court is adjourned until 1:40 p.m.!

The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber</span></center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, Gina. How are you holding up?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm starting to feel quite warmly towards her frequent cold shoulders now.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ginny! Are you alright? Why aren't you saying anything?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Wot's the point, eh? Why go to all this trouble an' fight so 'ard...for the likes o' me?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Well you saw it! That picture.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What picture?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah, you mean this? The photograph taken by Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder. Well, I didn't think it would have captured a scene like this, that's for sure!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
It's 'opeless. Anyone who sees that's gonna think I did it, ain't they?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...I won't pretend it wasn't a bit of a shock when the prosecution first presented it to the court.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Surely you've gotta 'ave yer doubts about me now. Ya can't still think I'm innocent.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Of course I can.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Hmph.........
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ginny...why don't you talk to us? Tell us what really happened that night.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Runo's cleverly managed to piece together a lot of new information, but still... ...we'd really like to hear it from you.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Alright then. It was after we'd 'ad that dinner together at your place, right, Iris? Then we all 'ad a chat up in your office, didn't we?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I remember.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
After that, I just couldn't get to sleep. So I slipped out an' went down the street to the two-to-one. To Windibank's place. ...I 'ad to know.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If Iris's story was there or not? 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I dunno wot it's about or nuffin'... ...but if you ask me, there's somefin' in it that Sholmes don't like. Somefin' wot 'e don't want people readin'. So that's why 'e lied to Iris about stickin' it in lug wiv Windibank for safekeepin'. At least, that's wot I thought at the time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you broke into Windibank's?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I just 'ad to know if it was there or not. I mean, I 'ad no idea all o' that was gonna kick off, did I? I struck the lock and snuck inside. It was dark as you like in there. So I gave the oil lamp on the counter a bit o' wick. And that's when...
</p>
<hr />
<center>What d'you think you're doing?!</center>
<center>AAAAAAGH!</center>
<hr />
<p>Gina:<br />
I nearly died, I did! And the next thing I knew... ...I'd grabbed the gun off the counter and was wavin' it in the air like...I dunno wot.
</p>
<hr />
<center>Ah...you're the girl who was in here this afternoon. I didn't think pickpockets went in for armed robbery.</center>
<center>The, the mantelscript... 'Ave you got it 'ere? Did Sholmes leave a load o' papers wiv you? A story.</center>
<p><br />
Windibank:
</p>
<center>I beg your pardon?</center>
<p><br />
Gina:
</p>
<center>'The Hound o' the...' somefin'-or-other. If it's 'ere, I wanna see it!</center>
<p><br />
Windibank:
</p>
<center>I'm sorry, young lady... ...but I'd sooner die than relinquish an article belonging to one of my customers.</center>
<p><br />
Gina:
</p>
<center>I don't want it! Wot would I do wiv it anyway? I just...wanna see it's 'ere, that's all.</center>
<p><br />
Windibank:
</p>
<center>Oh, you want to see it, do you?</center>
<p><br />
Gina:
</p>
<center>I wanna know if Sholmes really pawned it 'ere or not. Please! Just let me see it an' I'll go.</center>
<p><br />
Windibank:
</p>
<center>......... Oh, very well then. But for pity's sake, stop waving my gun around, would you?</center>
<hr />
<p>Gina:<br />
So then the old cove unlocked the storeroom door, and we both went inside. And it was there alright. The mantelscript. Sholmes weren't lyin' after all.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You did all that just to check for me, Ginny?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...Anyway, then there was a bit of a kick-up out in the main bit o' the shop.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The Skulkin brothers arriving on the scene, yes.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gina:
</p>
<center>Wot was that noise? Someone's breakin' in!</center>
<p><br />
Windibank:
</p>
<center>Dear me, is there some burglars' convention here tonight that I don't know about?</center>
<p><br />
Gina:
</p>
<center>...I think I forgot to shut the door be'ind me. Sorry.</center>
<p><br />
Windibank:
</p>
<center>I'd better go and take care of it. Could I possibly have my gun back?</center>
<p><br />
Gina:
</p>
<center>Oh, well I'll come wiv ya and-</center>
<p><br />
Windibank:
</p>
<center>Now don't be foolish, young girl. You must stay right here. Don't leave this room under any circumstances.</center>
<hr />
<p>Gina:<br />
An' wiv that, 'e took the gun out of me 'ands and walked back out into the shop. I 'ung back in the storeroom like 'e said, strainin' me ears in the dark to 'ear wot was goin' on. It sounded like they got into a bit of a scrap. I started to think I should 'elp, see. So I was just about to go out the storeroom myself, when...
</p>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*<br />*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<p>Gina:<br />
I 'eard a couple o' shots go off. Two, I think. Almost at the same time. And then there 'e was, right at me feet. Lyin' face down on the floor! I was right next to the storeroom door, so I slammed it shut an' locked it quick as ya like.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Because you thought whoever had shot Mr Windibank might come for you?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Yeah. So I went to grab the old cove's gun. I figured I'd put up a fight at least. But when I got a better look at 'im, I knew... ...Windibank was <span style="color:#E16935">a goner</span>. I felt funny in me 'ead all of a sudden. Kind of dizzy. And after that...I don't remember nuffin'.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That must be when you passed out, Gina.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... If...if I 'adn't done wot I done... ...the old cove might still be alive!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Did you tell the police everything you just told us?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
'Course I did! But they didn't believe a word of it, did they? All they said was, if I kept tellin' lies, it'd make things even worse for me. .........
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It'll be alright, Ginny, don't worry. Just stay strong a little longer. Runo's about to put the real culprit through the mill!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... That cove wot was there in the afternoon? That <span style="color:#E16935">Eggert Benedict</span>...
</p>
<center>I still remember 'ow 'e looked at me. Like I was nuffin'. 'E...'e was there that night.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
We don't know his real name yet... ...but I'm convinced that he's involved somehow.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Anyway, thank you for telling us what happened, Gina. I appreciate your honesty.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
You wot?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You can leave it all in Runo's capable hands now, Ginny!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Mr Narra-'Oddo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...'Ow come you trust me? I don't get it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I mean, 'ave you forgotten wot 'appened 'ere before? Come on, it was only two months ago. Me and McGilded...we told you a whole pack o' lies. An' you got the bogtrotter off wiv 'em! Even though 'e was a killer!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... No, I could never forget that.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I did what I thought was best at the time. But the pain of that error of judgement doesn't get any easier to bear.)</span> Still, don't forget that I also made you a promise. I told you that I'd be on your side to the bitter end, no matter what.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
But wot if I'm lyin'?! You could be workin' to get another killer off the 'ook for all you know!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I was once in your position, Gina. I was <span style="color:#E16935">the accused</span> in a trial.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
You were?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Before I left Japan. I was accused of murder. And strange as it might sound, the circumstances of the crime were pretty damning. I was sure that no one would believe it wasn't me who'd done it.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, Runo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But there was one person who stood up for me. Who believed in me, and was prepared to defend me. My best friend.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke, no one believes in you more than I do. Leave this to me. All you need to do is put your faith in me, and I'll do the rest!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I was so happy, I cried. But even then... ...somewhere inside me, I couldn't help thinking: 'Surely he doesn't really believe in me. Not completely.'
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...I was wrong.
</p>
<center>As soon as my trial began, it was obvious... ...that he had an absolute, unwavering belief in me. And in turn, I developed an absolute, unwavering belief in him.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Since then, I came to realise... ...if you want someone to believe in you, you have to believe in the other person first.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Wot are you sayin'...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I promise you, Gina, that no matter what happens, I'll keep believing in you. So you don't need to worry. I won't let you down.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Even though I'm a diver? ...And a no-good liar?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... You're not like McGilded. I know that.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's right! You're our friend, Ginny!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I-Iris!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We know you better than you think. And we've come to the conclusion that you're someone we can trust.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's really all we need to know.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Exactly!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Um...Mr Narra-'Oddo, I, um... I... *Sniffle, sniffle*
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Defendant Gina Lestrade and her legal representative! Court proceedings are about to resume. Please head into the courtroom immediately!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, of course! Thank you.

<center>I'd been both <span style="color:#E16935">a defendant</span> and <span style="color:#E16935">a defending lawyer</span> in my time. So I knew only too well... ...just how hard it was to <span style="color:#E16935">put all your faith in another</span>.

<center><span style="color:green">17th April, 1:41 p.m.<br />
The Old Bailey Courtroom</span></center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
I hereby call this court to order as we resume the trial of Miss Gina Lestrade. Lord van Zieks, have you successfully subpoenaed the witness?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The subpoena was delivered to the communication station where the man works immediately, My Lord. However, the heavy rain has delayed the arrival of his carriage, it would seem.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm, I see. Then let us turn our attention to Inspector Gregson's precis of the case heard by the court this morning. The glaring omission of the third bullet in your report is a serious blunder, Inspector.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes, um, I can only apologise, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And although the defence's chemical analysis of the blood at the scene makes for a compelling argument... ...I cannot permit such untried methods to be used as evidence in my courtroom.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hmph! It's a big mistake to cross Hurley and me. A very big mistake!
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
My Lord! The subpoenaed witness has just arrived in the building.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Officer. Show him to the stand without delay.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Mr <span style="color:#E16935">Eggert Benedict</span>... I didn't expect to be crossing paths with him again so soon. And certainly not like this.)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Thank you for complying with the court's subpoena at such short notice, sir.
</p><p>???:<br />
But of course, My Lord. As an upstanding member of London society, it is my pleasure to oblige.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, kindly state your name and occupation for the record.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Ashley Graydon, communications officer.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Mr Graydon and I both work at London's central communication station.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Now perhaps somebody would kindly explain what all this is about?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You were apprised of the situation by the court officer on your way here, I presume.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes, I was. Something to do with a murder that took place at a pawnbroker's on Baker Street. And some nonsense about me having been there on the night in question.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
That is the accusation, indeed.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
This really is beyond a joke, you know.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. Without further delay, the court will hear your testimony now, Mr Graydon. You will respond to the accusation made against you under oath.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Gladly, My Lord. Gladly.
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span><br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- The Accusation -</span></center>
<p>Graydon:<br />
Naturally, I have occasion to make use of pawnbroking services from time to time.<br />
But are you seriously suggesting I colluded with these thugs to break into the place on the night of the murder?<br />
...I have no intention of admitting to such an outrageous accusation.<br />
Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.<br />
Some scaramouch detective's homebrewed tincture can hardly be taken as serious evidence.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
So...you deny the accusation completely, do you?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
I must say, I am dismayed. For the highest court in the land to be swayed by this self-professed detective's toy...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It was the will of the jury. And our great British justice system demands that the jury's will is upheld.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Then it would seem we have the misfortune of a most inept assembly of jurors today.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...! By golly!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
How long am I expected to be detained here?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If, following the defence's cross-examination, your involvement in this matter has not been established... ...you will be free to leave immediately.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Good. Then I shall be away in time for afternoon tea. Some small consolation at least.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Let us not hold up Mr Graydon any longer than necessary, Counsel. Proceed with the cross-examination.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...we meet again, Mr <span style="color:#E16935">Eggert Benedict</span>. Or is it Mr Graydon?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
......... My apologies. You are...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ryunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer. We have met.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
If you say so. Ashley Graydon. Enchanté. So...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...I trust we can conclude this quickly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(But I'm NOT holding your flashy hat while we do.)</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Blood was found at the scene of the crime. There's no question of that. Mr Sholmes's chemical analysis has positively identified the substance as such.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
But I am not the only human to have blood running through my veins, am I? How can you be sure that <span style="color:#E16935">the blood</span> is mine? It could equally be <span style="color:#E16935">the blood</span> of one of these two miscreants.

A great detective, you say? Tsk! Now we're in the realm of fairy tales, are we? The counsel for the defence thinks a British courtroom is an appropriate place for fairy tales, does he?

Hmmm...

We know that someone other than the victim was hit by a bullet at the scene of the crime two nights ago. And from the height of the bullet hole in the wall, that person was likely hit in <span style="color:#E16935">the upper arm</span> or thereabouts.

You have shown no evidence whatsoever that links me to these common thieves. Accordingly, I am not obliged to permit any such invasion of my privacy!

I think he has no intention of telling us anything. He's well aware that the less he says, the less chance he has of giving himself away.

Hm... The complete opposite of Hurley, then. He seems to think that the more he says, the better.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, at least I managed to prise a little more information from these witnesses' lips. All thanks to the Skulkin brothers...

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Have you ever seen this disk before, Mr Graydon?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
......... Why? Is it supposed to mean something?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This disk was, until the day of his murder, in pawn in Mr Windibank's shop. It was redeemed by the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade that afternoon. However... ...somebody mysteriously appeared to try to take it from her. And that somebody was you, of course. Wasn't it, Mr Graydon?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
As I have reiterated numerous times now...you are mistaken. That was not me. I've never seen that disk before in my life.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It may have escaped your notice, but there is a small <span style="color:#E16935">smear of blood</span> on the disk.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah yes. Resulting from an abrasion of <span style="color:#E16935">the thumb</span>, perhaps?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right. The surface of the disk is covered in hundreds of tiny metal bumps. In the skirmish to acquire the disk, the thumb of the person who tried to take it suffered minor lacerations.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So! While the disk bears the remnants of that skirmish in the form of this smear of blood... ...the thumb of the person in question must bear the remnants also. In the form of <span style="color:#E16935">a scratch</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious! Indeed it must!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Graydon!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You refused to allow a court officer to examine your <span style="color:#E16935">arm</span> before. Are you now going to refuse to allow us to examine your <span style="color:#E16935">thumb</span>? Because I have no doubt that it bears <span style="color:#E16935">a small scratch</span> consistent with the smear of blood on this disk!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...! ......... Well well... ...it would seem I underestimated you.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What, what is the meaning of this?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you admit it now? You admit <span style="color:#E16935">you have a scratch</span> on your thumb from when you attempted to take the disk from the defendant?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! ...Well, Mr Graydon?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...It would appear there has been something of a misunderstanding here. I did not attempt to take the disk, as you put it. No, quite the reverse.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What are you trying to say?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
It's really quite simple, you see. <span style="color:#E16935">The disk was mine</span> from the outset. Is there some crime in taking an item that you own out of pawn?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It would seem, Mr Graydon... ...that in this piece of evidence, my learned friend has established a link between yourself and the incident. Accordingly...you will tell the court everything you know about this disk now.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...As you wish. Though I'm quite sure it has nothing whatsoever to do with the pawnbroker's murder.

<p>Graydon:<br />
There's a note on the disk saying, '<span style="color:#E16935">For McGilded</span>', but the item belongs to me.<br />
The redemption ticket was stolen from me by the accused - that filthy gutterling - on the day in question.<br />
I proceeded at once to the shop in order to explain my situation and redeem my article.<br />
In the end, of course, the disk was taken by the police.<br />
In other words...I had absolutely no reason to <span style="color:#E16935">break into the shop</span> later that same night.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Did I hear you correctly, sir? '<span style="color:#E16935">McGilded</span>', you say? The famous London philanthropist? Who perished in this very courtroom two months ago after being <span style="color:#E16935">acquitted</span> of a distinctly messy murder?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes, My Lord. The one and the same.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good Lord! Mr Graydon! Are you saying that Mr McGilded and yourself were <span style="color:#E16935">acquainted</span>?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
......... Yes. That's correct.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! ...Well. I certainly didn't expect to hear that name uttered here in my courtroom again.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(According to what Gina told us, this disk was placed in pawn on that fateful night two months ago. McGilded himself gave instructions to deposit it at Windibank's.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It's funny that Mr Graydon here is claiming the disk belongs to him then, isn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In all likelihood, <span style="color:#E16935">he's lying</span>. <span style="color:#0070C0">(So he appeared that afternoon at Windibank's in order to get his hands on <span style="color:#E16935">McGilded's disk</span> for some reason...)</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Would you care to explain how this belongs to you?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
As you will observe, a communications officer such as myself commands a fine salary.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You are certainly...exquisitely dressed, sir.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
So you see, I have little need to make use of the services provided by the pawnbrokery trade. However, I did once find myself in difficulties having misplaced my purse whilst on an errand. Which is why I pawned my fine black overcoat to the broker in question.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You claim that was your overcoat?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...Obviously. And in my haste, I clean forgot... ...that the music box <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span> was in its pocket.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And yet there is a note on it that reads, '<span style="color:#E16935">For McGilded</span>'.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
I am a collector of rare and unusual music box music. I first met Mr McGilded at a gentlemen's club in the city, and was interested to discover... ...that he shared my penchant in that area.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So the disk in question...
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
It's a pre-production sample. I promised to let Mr McGilded hear it.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But then you forgot that it was in the pocket of the overcoat you were forced to pawn.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes, exactly.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Gina didn't mention any of that in her <span style="color:#E16935">testimony</span> two months ago, did she?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No. Because McGilded had threatened her to <span style="color:#E16935">keep her mouth shut</span>. Which means that if we dig too deeply here... ...it's going to expose Gina's <span style="color:#E16935">perjury</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh dear...this is complicated, isn't it?

So when you noticed that the pickpocket had taken your ticket, you chased after her. Is that correct?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes, that's right. I didn't notice at first, of course. Such is the art of the pickpurse. But when I did, I headed to the pawnbrokery at once. In order to reclaim my coat before the thief could. I was merely trying to recover what was rightfully mine in the first place.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(McGilded slipped the disk into his coat pocket and had it deposited at Windibank's. Then, when he realised he was going to be arrested on suspicion of the omnibus murder... ...he threatened Gina and forced her to take the redemption ticket.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
There's no doubt about it, that witness is lying through his pearly white teeth!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The police were obviously after <span style="color:#E16935">anything left behind</span> by McGilded as well. That's why Inspector Gregson ended up taking <span style="color:#E16935">the disk</span> into custody that day.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But Gregsy's being very strange about all this.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There must be <span style="color:#E16935">a reason</span> for that, I'm sure. I just don't know what it is. <span style="color:#0070C0">(For now, I need to focus on exposing the fact that Mr Graydon is lying in his testimony.)</span>

This disk was deposited at Windibank's on Magnus McGilded's instructions. You knew that, and you went there with the intention of obtaining it for yourself.

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Conjecture again. And in any case, the disk was taken into custody by the police that afternoon. The witness had no <span style="color:#E16935">reason</span> to visit the pawnbrokery again that night!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry, my learned friend...but that's not true.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr McGilded had another article in pawn at Windibank's... ...as this second <span style="color:#E16935">pawnbroker's ticket</span> proves!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There were <span style="color:#E16935">two articles</span> belonging to Mr McGilded in Windibank's pawnbrokery. And the reason you broke into the shop that night was to recover <span style="color:#E16935">the second one</span>... ...together with your two <span style="color:#E16935">accomplices</span>, the Skulkin brothers!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... This is the second ticket, is it?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What had the man deposited?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The article description reads, '<span style="color:#E16935">one small box</span>'.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A rather vague description, it seems to me.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Are you suggesting that I <span style="color:#E16935">broke into</span> the pawnbrokery with these...clowns in order to steal some trinket box?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I believe there are adequate grounds to suspect that you did.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
This is absurd! Why on earth would I do such a thing? Once the article had been <span style="color:#E16935">forfeited</span>, I could simply walk into the shop and purchase it. There would be absolutely no need for me to resort to theft!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's a good point.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm, indeed. The witness makes a solid argument.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So that means that for some reason... ...this Graydon fellow needed <span style="color:#E16935">the small box</span> that very night, does it?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It's time to put an end to this nonsense, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Could you be a little less cryptic, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I do hate to ruin my learned friend's argument, but the truth is quite incontrovertible. On the night in question, no <span style="color:#E16935">small box</span> was taken from Windibank's pawnbrokery. And rest assured, the prosecution can prove it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Inspector, show the photographic prints to the court, if you please.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes, sir!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What prints?)</span>
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
These prints were taken from one of the detective's <span style="color:#E16935">security cameras</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah, Hurley's Red-Handed Recorders again!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As previously explained using this <span style="color:#E16935">plan</span> of the shop layout... ...the victim's establishment was furnished with automatic cameras in <span style="color:#E16935">two locations</span>. One was set to capture the counter where Mr Windibank received his customers... ...and the other was set to capture the shelves on which articles were placed for sale once forfeited.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Accordin' to the information on this ticket... ...McGilded's small box had been forfeited already. Two days before the incident, at 9 p.m. on 13th April to be precise. Which means it would have been on the shelves of forfeited items in the shop front. Now, what I have here is a print taken by one of the cameras about two hours before the incident. That's at 11 p.m. on 15th April.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm, the victim certainly had a very full shop, it would appear.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
And then here we have another print... This one was taken about two hours <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> the incident.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I see. So we have two pictures to compare. Though I must say that placing them side by side leaves me cold. Dear me, that's starting to make my head ache.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Obviously, at Scotland Yard we considered theft as one possible motive in this case. We explored the possibility that something had been taken in addition to the victim's life.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So your men have already compared these two prints thoroughly, Inspector?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes, sir! We counted every single item in each of these two photographic prints. And the Yard's conclusion is that <span style="color:#E16935">exactly the same number</span> are present in both!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
In other words, nothing was taken from the pawnbrokery on the night in question. And my learned friend's assertion is nothing more than a hopeful <span style="color:#E16935">fantasy</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
AAAAAAAAARGH! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't believe it! If I could have just shown that he'd <span style="color:#E16935">stolen</span> McGilded's pawned box... ...I might have been able to break him down at last.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You know what, Runo... ...I've been thinking. I wonder if these two photographs really are <span style="color:#E16935">exactly the same</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What...?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, Counsel...in the light of the evidence put forward by the prosecution, what is your position? It seems that in fact, on the night in question, <span style="color:#E16935">nothing was stolen</span> from the victim's establishment. Do you accept the prosecution's assertion?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't know... Could there be some hidden <span style="color:#E16935">discrepancy</span> in these two photographic prints somewhere?)</span>

</p><p>Judge:<br />

No! Wait, Runo! There's something out of place with these two prints, I'm sure of it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Iris:<br />
What about that trick that we just learnt? We should use that now to really examine these two prints thoroughly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright! Just, just uncross your eyes...please!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Counsel... ...I've finally become accustomed to the wide-eyed star that so frequently occupies your countenance. But that crossing of your eyes is another matter entirely! I'm afraid I must penalise you for it.

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I must thank my learned friend. His answer has clarified the situation greatly. There is indeed a discrepancy here. Between our respective powers of reasoning.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Let me guess... My powers of reasoning come up short?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It would appear you're learning, Counsel. But not quickly enough.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(But I'm sure it's there. It's subtle, but there's a difference between those two prints. I know there is!)</span>

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Granted, these two prints are <span style="color:#E16935">almost identical</span>. However, there is <span style="color:#E16935">one minor discrepancy</span> between them.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
WHAT?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
When you view the two pictures <span style="color:#E16935">stereoscopically</span>... ...a single area stands out as being different: the location of this <span style="color:#E16935">small box</span>.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Let me... Wait... Un-Unbelievable!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
By Jove, you're right! How extraordinary!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What this tells us is very simple! Mr McGilded's <span style="color:#E16935">small box</span> was indeed not stolen from Windibank's on the night in question. However, there can be no doubt... ...that somebody picked up this particular <span style="color:#E16935">box</span> and then returned it to its place on the shelves!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Are you suggesting that <span style="color:#E16935">the small box</span> originally deposited by Mr McGilded is in fact...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! The very same <span style="color:#E16935">small box</span> I just identified in those photographic prints!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Mindless guesswork! What if it was?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So a box was <span style="color:#E16935">moved</span> on the shelf. Nothing was stolen. Which means quite simply...that nothing has changed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That, that may be true, but... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright, <span style="color:#E16935">McGilded's box</span> wasn't stolen then... ...but doesn't the fact that <span style="color:#E16935">it was moved</span> like that change things?)</span>

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
That won't be necessary! Some <span style="color:#E16935">little box</span> belonging to a man who died two months ago can't possibly be relevant to this trial!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The court does not uphold your objection, Lord van Zieks. Bailiff! Arrange for an officer to go to Baker Street at once. Obtain <span style="color:#E16935">the small box</span> in question and bring it back here for further examination!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
We should have a report within half an hour. I think perhaps we should recess for a short while until the evidence is brought forth.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
To be hoodwinked by such a farce... Hmph. Disappointing.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I beg your pardon, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
This is nothing but <span style="color:#E16935">a smoke screen</span>. A Nipponese speciality, it would seem.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What are you trying to say?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My learned friend has persisted with the same line of reasoning from the very beginning. That this witness's intent was to steal an article belonging to Mr McGilded from the pawnbrokery. Yet common sense tells us...that none of the articles have <span style="color:#E16935">value</span> enough to be worth stealing in the first place.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Exactly! It would be beyond absurd to break into a place for the purpose of stealing such commonplace property.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If Your Lordship recalls, Mr McGilded perished two months ago, immediately after the conclusion of his trial. A trial in which he was found <span style="color:#E16935">not guilty</span>. A trial in which it was established he was the upstanding member of society his reputation implied, in fact. So I propose a toast. To my learned friend, and his most...insightful defence.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
The articles this upstanding member of society pawned were entirely ordinary. A black overcoat that just happened to have a music box disk in one of its pockets. And a small box. I assure you, I wouldn't accept even if the man tried to make a gift of such things to me.
</p><p>You know, that does make rather a lot of sense.<br />
It's not as if it was gold or jewels, is it? Though goodness knows, Mr McGilded was rich enough!<br />
But you can't deposit cash at a pawnbrokery. I'm quite certain of that.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...The prosecution's argument is undeniably compelling.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It is incumbent on the defence now to bolster its argument. To explain what possible <span style="color:#E16935">significance</span> these commonplace articles pawned by this fine citizen could have!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, Counsel? Is your argument in fact demonstrable? Are you able to show <span style="color:#E16935">proof</span> that the disk or the box are in any tangible way related to this case?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...erm... .........
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What's the matter, Runo? We know that they're related, don't we? They're both vital pieces of <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, of course. You and I both know that. We know McGilded's true character. And we know the disk is significant, even if we don't know why. But if we explain all that to the court at this point... ...we'll have to acknowledge that McGilded's <span style="color:#E16935">acquittal</span> two months ago was a mistake. That the defence's argument was <span style="color:#E16935">flawed</span>. Based on false information.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh no!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And that would mean... ...admitting that Gina committed <span style="color:#E16935">perjury</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But Ginny...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Could it be that van Zieks knows? Is that why he's doing this now? Because he anticipated <span style="color:#E16935">everything</span>?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But maybe... ...this could be a great opportunity for us.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? What do you mean, Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, what is it that you always say, Runo? 'Sooner or later, the truth comes out. Every time!'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright, the exact significance of the things that McGilded deposited with Mr Windibank... ...is something that only Gina can explain to the court. But if I put her on the stand to testify about that... ...it could critically <span style="color:#E16935">damage our chances</span> of winning this case. What's the right thing to do here?)</span>

While the court awaits the arrival of Mr McGilded's small box... ...I would like to call the defendant, <span style="color:#E16935">Miss Gina Lestrade</span>, to the witness stand.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The defendant? To what end?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's to do with the various articles deposited at Windibank's by Mr McGilded, My Lord. Miss Lestrade has information relating to them. I believe it would be beneficial for the court to hear what she has to say. It will prove <span style="color:#E16935">the significance</span> of the articles in question once and for all!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Well well...things are becoming interesting. I presume you've considered the implications of the testimony you're proposing? In particular, the impact it will have on the accused's standing...and indeed your own.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I have.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Lord van Zieks? Would you care to explain that last remark?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution accepts the defence's proposal. I move to interrupt the cross-examination of the current witness and hear from the accused herself!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......... Very well, if you have no objection. So, the court will now hear the testimony of the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade. You witnesses currently in the stand may step down until further notice.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Then I shall bid you good day.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Wait. You, sir, shall remain in the stand while Miss Lestrade testifies.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
......... As you wish.

Good luck, Runo...

<p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The articles that Mr McGilded had deposited in Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...are intimately related with the omnibus case, the trial of which was heard in this courtroom two months ago.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes... And I remember this young lady being brought before me in that trial as well.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right, My Lord. Her testimony helped to establish the innocence of the defendant, Mr McGilded.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The omnibus case was...intriguing, to say the least. And now here we all are again. The same players in that trial facing each other once more. A twist of fate perhaps...my Nipponese friend.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Allow me to recap the events of two months ago. An old brickmaker was stabbed to death in an omnibus running along London's winter streets. Apart from the victim, there was only one other person in the carriage: Mr McGilded. Naturally, he was the prime suspect for the murder. But as the trial progressed, another possibility emerged. That the murder in fact took place above the defendant's head on the roof deck... ...with the body then being dropped through the skylight into the carriage below. It was Miss Lestrade whose testimony brought that possibility to light. At the time of the incident, Miss Lestrade was concealed under a seat in the carriage... ...hoping to pick the pockets of unsuspecting passengers. Then, immediately after the trial, having being acquitted of the murder... ...Mr McGilded died in this very courtroom, in the most extraordinary of circumstances.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
A mystery that remains unsolved even now, two months on. As indeed does the omnibus murder itself.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Be that as it may... ...I recall neither the disk nor this 'small box' being mentioned in the course of those proceedings.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Lestrade...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Would you tell the court now, please? What really happened in the omnibus two months ago, I mean.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... I dunno wot ya mean. I already said all of wot I know!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And what about everything you told us yesterday from inside your prison cell?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Please, Miss Lestrade. This is extremely important.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
B-But...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Remember, little girl... ...if it transpires that you wilfully withheld information in the trial two months ago... ...the Home Office will seek to prosecute you for <span style="color:#E16935">perjury</span>.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And naturally, you will lose all credibility as a witness. Although, let's face facts... ...you have little credibility to lose.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ginny, don't listen to him! Please! You have to trust Runo now!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I-Iris...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
We're on your side!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Alright then. ...I'll talk.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's the right choice, Gina.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Well, it would seem that my learned friend... ...is hell-bent on bringing the entire courtroom down about his ears. ...So be it.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I must confess that I'm struggling to understand what on earth is happening here. However, it would appear that Mr McGilded's pawned articles and that extraordinary case of the omnibus... ...harbour <span style="color:#E16935">secrets</span> of which we have been hitherto unaware.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, Miss Lestrade, you will now give your testimony before the court about the events of two months ago. You will reveal the truth, a commodity sorely lacking in your original statements!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is it, then. Everything's going to come out. Like van Zieks said... ...this could bring the whole courtroom down about my ears. But as a lawyer, I'm prepared to take that risk.)</span>

<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span><br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- The Real Truth of the Omnibus Case -</span></center>
<p>Gina:<br />
Truth is, that brickmaker cove was in the cabin o' the omnibus the whole time.<br />
When the Irishman dragged me out from under the seat, I saw that disk on the floor.<br />
All of a sudden, I 'eard a scream from over me 'ead, an' that pair on the roof deck went off to call the slops.<br />
That's when McGilded slipped the driver some tin to do a run to the pawn shop round about.<br />
...He threatened me not to snitch. Not to say nuffin' to no one about wot I'd seen or 'eard.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Good grief, this is outrageous! What you've just told the court bears almost no resemblance to your testimony two months ago!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As you say, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Then, then there's every chance... ...I may have adjudicated in error in McGilded's trial! It sounds very much to me as if the man deliberately deceived this court... ...in an effort to cover up the most wicked of <span style="color:#E16935">schemes</span>!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Without doubt, Your Lordship is correct. A great injustice was done in this courtroom two months ago. The actions of the accused in that trial, of this witness...and of my learned friend are entirely inexcusable!
</p>
<center>I don't believe it!</center>
<center>The whole trial was a farce? It was all lies?</center>
<center>That McGilded fellow was rotten to the core! Just like that pickpocket!</center>
<center>Don't forget that lawyer from the East! They were all in on it together!</center>
<p><br />
Gina:<br />
Yer wrong, the lot o' ya! Mr Narra-'Oddo - the lawyer there - 'e didn't know nuffin' about it!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Humbug!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
I don't think so. Are we really expected to believe that?
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
He really stitched everyone up, didn't he? What an operation, to get the man off scot-free!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Unforgivable! Stop. The lies have to stop! Stop.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, the defence made a terrible error of judgement. I intend to take full responsibility and suffer whatever consequences are deemed appropriate. ...However! It's imperative that the court allows the witness to elaborate on her testimony. Because the true significance of McGilded's pawned articles must be brought to light!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Very well...my learned student friend...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Given the depths of calamity you have just plunged yourself into, this may well be worth hearing.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Words fail me. This situation is...utterly deplorable. Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I will decide upon your fate following the conclusion of this trial.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Of course, My Lord.

Now, in your testimony two months ago... ...I feel certain that you claimed Mr McGilded was the sole passenger, did you not?

False testimony, My Lord.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
That's...that's wot 'e told me I 'ad to say.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But it's important that you tell us the truth now. Were Mr McGilded and the victim acquaintances?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I dunno. But I did 'ear 'em talkin' a lot.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What were they talking about?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Well I couldn't 'ear too well. But if I 'ad to say... ...I think it was about money or somefin'. They kept talkin' about 'buyin&#39;' and 'not buyin&#39;'.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm, perhaps business dealings of some kind...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Well anyway, they got louder an' louder. It started to sound like a proper fight. I was pretty scared by then. I 'ardly dared to breathe. And then, all of a sudden... ...I 'eard a noise like someone keelin' over on the floor. It was bloomin' loud an' all.

And I believe you let out an involuntary scream?

Yeah. That's wot gave me away.

Which included giving false testimony in court two months ago?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Yeah, that's it. And there was one other thing 'e said.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Which was?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
'E told me I'd 'ave to 'ang on to <span style="color:#E16935">the ticket</span> from the pawn shop. An' make sure not to lose it.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The ticket...? Well I never!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Said that if 'e didn't show up to get the ticket off me before two months passed... ...I 'ad to go to the pawn shop and pay the money to keep it in lug. To stop it bein' forfeited. 'E left me wiv some brass to pay for it.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But really... ...why on earth would Mr McGilded have done such a thing? Depositing his overcoat with a pawnbroker before the arrival of the police... It makes no sense at all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There would seem to be only one logical explanation, My Lord. What McGilded had the driver deposit at Windibank's was something he didn't want the police to see. Something <span style="color:#E16935">very important</span>, that he needed to hide at all costs.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Anyway...after that, 'e let me go. So I legged it before the coppers showed up.

<p><i>After pressing all statements (without pursuing) and pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson:</i>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Miss Lestrade. Thank you, Counsel. I've heard enough. I believe we now have a reasonable understanding of what actually transpired on the omnibus.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It would appear on that night two months ago, <span style="color:#E16935">a negotiation</span> was taking place on the omnibus. A negotiation concerning this disk. However, matters did not run smoothly. When the parties involved began to quarrel over price, McGilded took what he wanted by force... ...at the expense of <span style="color:#E16935">the other man's life</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which proves my point! The disk is clearly extremely valuable in some way! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Although I don't understand why as yet.)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And two days ago, precisely two months after the omnibus incident... ...McGilded's coat and its contents were due to be forfeited.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I didn't know wot I should do wiv the ticket. I mean, the cove died right after 'is trial. I knew that.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So you decided you would try to claim the articles as your own.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Well why not, eh? They were only gonna be forfeited! Why shouldn't I 'ave got 'em? Anyway, ya can't blame me for thinkin' about it. Thinkin' ain't no crime!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Miss Lestrade, it would appear Mr McGilded was prepared to kill in order to take possession of this disk. Do you know why that would be?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh? I ain't got a clue! But I reckon it must be worth a fair bit o' brass. 'E was probably gonna sell it. An' ya can't blame me for thinkin' that! Thinkin' ain't no crime!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm...
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>My Lord!</center>
<p><br />
Bailiff:
</p>
<center>The evidence Your Lordship requested has been located and is ready for the court's inspection, sir!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The mysterious <span style="color:#E16935">little box</span>, deposited by McGilded two months ago... There's no doubt in my mind that it's a key piece in this far-reaching puzzle!)</span>
</p>
<div style="text-align: right;">To be continued...</div>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
So this is the article in question, is it? The '<span style="color:#E16935">small box</span>' deposited with the pawnbroker by Mr McGilded two months ago.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...And on the night of Mr Windibank's murder... ...<span style="color:#E16935">the only item</span> on the shelves that was touched by whoever broke in to the shop.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Quick, quick! Let's open it and see what's inside!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious! This is no ordinary box, it seems!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Wow! ...Although in truth, I had an inkling that might be the case.)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...It would appear that the box houses <span style="color:#E16935">a miniature music box movement</span>.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Then...is it too much to expect...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I think it would be reasonable to assume that it is a device for the playback of this <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span>, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, here we have the means to play back Mr McGilded's <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span>, deposited at Windibank's at much the same time.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Not strictly correct, My Lord. It was not McGilded's disk. It was <span style="color:#E16935">the disk</span> of his victim in the omnibus.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But why, for heaven's sake? Are we to understand that the brickmaker was trying to sell this music box <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span> to Mr McGilded?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I believe the answer will become clear if we listen to the music on <span style="color:#E16935">the disk</span>, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, very well. Let the court now listen to this curious <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span> at last.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This disk may very well have motivated the culprit in this case to commit murder! Clearly there's every chance that it's fundamentally important to understanding what happened!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution has no objection.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
But, but no! That piece of evidence is police property now! You can't-
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Clearly Scotland Yard has some vested interest here. But it is policy of this prosecutor to leave no avenues unexplored. And you, Inspector, have no jurisdiction here to prevent that from happening.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
GA-AAAAAAAARGH!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
No further delays, please. Play the disk!

Well obviously! In fact, I wouldn't be surprised... ...if the officer sent to fetch it didn't drop it on the way back to the courtroom.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, with much regret... ...I feel the court must accept that this music box offers little in the way of clues.

.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Are you ready to move on, Counsel?

You told the court before that you worked at the same <span style="color:#E16935">communication station</span> as Mr Graydon, did you not?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Y-Yes, that's correct.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And the particular <span style="color:#E16935">station</span> where you work... ...deals with government communications and newspaper reports?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Oh, yes! We're not your run-of-the-mill communication station at all. Our work is extremely important.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then tell me...is this not a very familiar sound?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Hm...? ......... You, you don't mean to say...? Is it...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right, madam. It bears more than a passing resemblance to the sound made by your <span style="color:#E16935">telegraph</span> machine as you tap it. I believe it's called...<span style="color:#E16935">Morse code</span>?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
But... I don't believe it!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Now correct me if I'm wrong...but when it comes to leaking <span style="color:#E16935">telegrams</span> from government departments... ...there could be nobody more perfectly placed than a highly skilled <span style="color:#E16935">communications officer</span>!

Are, are you suggesting that the music box <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span>... ...contains <span style="color:#E16935">stolen government secrets</span> in Morse code?!

</p><p>Judge:<br />
For our sovereign government's confidential <span style="color:#E16935">information</span>, hostile nations would surely pay almost any price!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...and on that night two months ago... ...that was the very <span style="color:#E16935">negotiation</span> that was taking place inside the omnibus!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But in the end, McGilded perished, and the all-important <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span> lay unclaimed in the pawnbrokery...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
My word!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In which case... ...whoever stole that <span style="color:#E16935">information</span> in the first place must surely have been beside himself with worry. Because if the disk were to be discovered before it found its way out of the country...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...It would reveal an act of <span style="color:#E16935">high treason</span> punishable by death!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So the culprit had no choice but to retrieve it. And in order to do that... ...he would have to <span style="color:#E16935">gain entry to the pawnbrokery illegally</span> in the middle of the night. Because <span style="color:#E16935">the article</span> left behind by Mr McGilded would incriminate him too much if it got into the wrong hands. Isn't that right...Mr Graydon?!

This is the mechanism that turns the bumps on the disk into sound...isn't it?

Yes, the 'movement'. It's all thanks to the comb with its teeth that are plucked by the passing bumps. Usually, the teeth on the comb are different lengths so that each one produces a different tone. But this comb is very strange. All the teeth are exactly the same length.

It means that no matter which tooth is plucked by the passing bumps, the music box will make the same sound. I've never seen a music box like it before.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, it is strange. A music box that can only play a single note... <span style="color:#0070C0">(There has to be some significance to that, surely.)</span>

Yes, I think so. And it looks like the two movements are linked together.

So...this movement also only produces a single tone, like the other one?

Yes, it must do. Except that the length of the teeth on the two combs isn't the same. So the single tone produced by this movement will be different to the single tone we've already heard.

</p><p>Graydon:<br />
How could I possibly know?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Any important government communications are handled by high-level officers. By specialists. General members of staff in the station where I work would never be entrusted with sensitive information.

</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
We regular communication station officers aren't as lowly as you're being led to believe! A team of us are responsible for setting up and testing the telegraphs used by the ministry. And Mr Graydon is the team leader!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's...fascinating.

</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Graydon is highly skilled operator! Stop. Currently in presence of idol! Stop.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... So you had access to the equipment used for these confidential communications, Mr Graydon...
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Well, what of it?! The transmissions are always made behind closed doors so they can't be heard! And in any case, all messages are sent enciphered. Normal employees couldn't possibly understand them!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Oh no! Stop. Must say something! Stop. Mr Graydon regularly attends meetings with ministry technicians and the ministry communications team! He assists them in ensuring that there are no errors in important international communications! And he's received the top prize at the Cipher-Cracking Convention five years in a row now!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
They're not?!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
To anyone with a brain, that would be blatantly apparent on listening to that music box for even a few seconds.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Of course, of course.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Surely it can't be that my learned friend is unfamiliar with <span style="color:#E16935">Morse code</span>?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ouch. He looks genuinely shocked at my ignorance.)</span>
</p>
???:<center>Ha ha ha!</center>
<p><br />
Juror No. 5:<br />
I would be more than happy to demonstrate the basics for you, sir.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A, a lesson...here in court?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Morse code is a continuous series of <span style="color:#E16935">two distinct tones</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Tones, you say?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Yes. A short '<span style="color:#E16935">dot</span>' and a long '<span style="color:#E16935">dash</span>'. By combining those in different ways, you construct letters.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I see...
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
For example, this is '<span style="color:#E16935">A</span>'... And this is '<span style="color:#E16935">B</span>'... But when you listen to the sound produced by this music box, you only hear one tone, don't you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but it sounds so similar! The rhythm of it is the same and everything!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But there's no discernible meaning to this apparently random sequence of sounds. So your assertion is fundamentally flawed. This is not Morse code.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
NOOOOOOOO!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Ha ha ha ha ha... Really, you shouldn't be so surprised. What did I tell you? That music box is nothing but a worthless piece of scrap! Perhaps you might consider studying your subject matter before casting aspersions in future!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh... Stop. Nothing to say, but... Stop.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, it's so frustrating, isn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I mean, if the government secrets were somehow being leaked using the music box... ...so many other things would slot into place so nicely.

Does it please you in some way, my Nipponese friend, to repeat the same line of argument ad infinitum? It's already been established that to be Morse code, two tones are required. Dots...and dashes.

Yes, I'm well aware of that.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It appears, My Lord, that the two movements are <span style="color:#E16935">linked</span> together.

As the court has heard, Morse code comprises of <span style="color:#E16935">two tones</span>: a short 'dot' and a long 'dash'. With <span style="color:#E16935">a second disk</span> in place, this music box could be used to generate Morse code and convey a message!

I, I can't...at the moment.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And may I remind the court that as the witness has pointed out... ...he was not the one in the omnibus with McGilded two months ago, striking a deal over the disk or disks.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed. That was <span style="color:#E16935">Mr Mason</span>, the brickmaker.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Exactly! I had nothing whatsoever to do with it!

So two months ago in that omnibus...McGilded killed the brickmaker and stole <span style="color:#E16935">the disk</span>...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Mr Mason was a single man with almost nothing to his name. It seems he lived in an artisan quarter some years ago, but people there remember little about him.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That doesn't make much sense, though, does it? How would a humble brickmaker come to acquire secret government information?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
How indeed?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There must have been <span style="color:#E16935">somebody else</span> involved behind the scenes in all of this. Somebody who acquired <span style="color:#E16935">the disk</span> and gave it to Mr Mason... ...in order to take it to the meeting with McGilded and negotiate <span style="color:#E16935">a deal</span>!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
......... Dear me. You may have it in for me, sir, but I assure you...I have far more class than that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(An old brickmaker from an artisan quarter and this well-to-do communications officer... If only I could find some evidence to <span style="color:#E16935">link</span> the two of them together...)</span>
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........

If you have nothing more to add on that note, let us return to the witness testimony.

Mr <span style="color:#E16935">Ashley Milverton</span>... Tell me, why did you try to hide your former name from the court?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Because I <span style="color:#E16935">haven't gone by that name for years</span>. It means nothing to me!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, I don't think that's the real explanation at all. The truth is...you had a reason to hide that name!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Explain yourself, please, Counsel.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I have here the notes from the omnibus case, My Lord. And as we all know, the victim - the man who we now understand to have been <span style="color:#E16935">negotiating</span> with McGilded...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes...Mr Mason, the brickmaker?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right. Only 'Mason' wasn't his surname at all. It was his given name. His full name...was <span style="color:#E16935">Mason Milverton</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mil... <span style="color:#E16935">Milverton</span>?! Do, do you mean to say...? Saints alive!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Ashley Milverton... ...is it not the case that the brickmaker, Mr Mason Milverton...was your father?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Ugh! I, I don't...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As I believe I mentioned earlier... ...your family history will have been thoroughly checked when you joined the civil service. And it really would take no time at all for the court to subpoena those records.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Grrr...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The truth is you have been illegally acquiring highly confidential government information... ...and selling it on to McGilded in <span style="color:#E16935">collaboration</span> with your father!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />

</p><p>Graydon:<br />
This is slander!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
I carved a new life for myself as a respectable communications officer. As a gentleman! I have no idea what my father has been up to. But it has nothing to do with me!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And may I remind the court... ...that the assertion that this disk contains some sort of message in Morse code has been reliably disproven. By a professional and independent communications officer, no less.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... The relationship between the victim of the omnibus case and this witness is undoubtedly significant. However, the defence's argument remains somewhat incomplete, I feel.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I believe the cross-examination should continue.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright, so Morse code uses two tones. If I could just demonstrate <span style="color:#E16935">the possibility</span> that this could have been used to generate two distinct tones...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hm...perhaps we should have a really good look over the music box, Runo.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You will reiterate your testimony if you please, Mr Graydon.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
If I must, though I maintain exactly what I did at the start of this pointless cross-examination.

In your original testimony... ...you said that the door of the shop was ajar, and that it was like some kind of a sign, begging you to go in. But the truth is...you were planning to break into Windibank's all along, weren't you?

We were, guv, we were. Yer right there.

Well, um...erm... ...'E said the place woz full o' stuff worth nickin'. That's wot 'e told us beforehand, anyway. Turned out it woz a load o' cobblers, didn't it? I weren't best pleased, I can tell ya!

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
All of a sudden, we seem to be up to our necks in a serious matter of national security. Although all this talk about interception of secret government messages is still just conjecture at this stage.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It would explain a number of things though, wouldn't it? The negotiation Ginny overheard on the omnibus two months ago, and the break-in at Windibank's. But the trouble is, it wasn't Mr Graydon in the omnibus with Mr McGilded...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, that was Mr Mason, the brickmaker who was so horribly murdered.

Hm...if only there was some <span style="color:#E16935">link</span> between the two men somehow.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I know. But Mr Graydon's testimony seems to be as watertight as ever. I wonder if the key to us making headway with the cross-examination here... <span style="color:#0070C0">(...could be those two brothers.)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Graydon:<br />
AAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The new facts and evidence unveiled by the cross-examination of this witness... ...all come together to reveal <span style="color:#E16935">the truth</span>!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
The, the truth, you say?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That you collaborated with your father, Mr Mason Milverton, in <span style="color:#E16935">illegal dealings</span> with Magnus McGilded.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
By dint of this music box, you mean, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. Stealing information being sent in secret government communications, and selling it on to McGilded... Mr Graydon concocted this elaborate scheme of using two music box disks to encode the information... ...as, presumably, <span style="color:#E16935">a safety measure</span> against the information falling into the wrong hands.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And a very effective one. I shouldn't have given the scheme any credence whatsoever.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But the deal with McGilded went sour...and the brickmaker met his end.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, but before he was arrested, McGilded managed to temporarily dispose of the stolen disk at the pawnbroker. Then, having learnt of the situation, you appeared at Windibank's two days ago... ...in an attempt to recover the two articles McGilded had placed in pawn there.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But that attempt failed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
One of the disks was seized by the police, and the other, you never found. So that same night... ...you enlisted the help of the Skulkin brothers and broke into the pawnbrokery. This time, determined to recover <span style="color:#E16935">the second disk</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Are, are you suggesting that the second disk...was inside the music box?!
</p><p>Nash:<br />
Eh?
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
We, we never knew nuffin' about that!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
On the night that Mr Windibank was killed... ...the intruder to the pawnbrokery <span style="color:#E16935">touched</span> one item, and one item alone: the music box.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
As rather ingeniously demonstrated using the two prints from the security camera, indeed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So, the question that naturally begs answering is this: why was only that one article disturbed? The answer is obvious: because it contained the second disk, which the intruder was desperate to <span style="color:#E16935">retrieve</span>. Since, if it were to fall into the hands of the police, it would be proof...of high treason.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, Mr Graydon? Do you deny that all of this actually began on that fateful night two months ago?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
......... I... I... I refuse to accept any of this nonsense!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sir... ...there appears to be <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span> seeping through the sleeve of your jacket.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
What?! Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Two nights ago... ...we know that three shots were fired at the scene of the crime in Windibank's pawnbrokery. One took the life of the pawnbroker himself... One struck the pouch around Mr Sholmes's waist... And the final bullet... ...struck the calendar on the wall of the shop, having first pierced the arm of <span style="color:#E16935">one of the intruders</span>. Mr Graydon... ...that wound on your <span style="color:#E16935">arm</span> that you seem to be trying to hide... It's a bullet wound, isn't it?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Nash:<br />
'E's got ya now, me old china.
</p><p>Ringo:<br />
Time to call it quits an' croak, I reckon.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
......... Tsk. 'Don't acknowledge my presence there under any circumstances whatsoever.' Those were my terms, remember? And I paid you handsomely to comply. Clearly I was a fool to think I could trust some common back slum thieves.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Fine. I admit it. I was there in Windibank's that night. I paid this pair ten guineas to accompany me. And as you've noticed, I sustained an injury in the course of my adventures. But that is all! I admit to nothing more! Stealing government secrets? <span style="color:#E16935">Negotiating</span> with Mr McGilded? As God is my witness...I'm sure I recall nothing of the sort!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's not going to go down without a fight. Not until I can show hard evidence, I suppose.)</span> Nevertheless, the defence has now established <span style="color:#E16935">a crucial fact</span>.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Which is...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, we know that one bullet was fired from each of the two firearms we have in evidence. The bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun hit the pouch around Mr Sholmes's waist. And the bullet from Mr Windibank's gun... ...clearly must have been the one that caught Mr Graydon on the arm.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed it must. We can rule out the possibility that the man shot himself.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And that leads us to only one conclusion: Mr Windibank was shot by a third gun... ...which can only have been fired by <span style="color:#E16935">the third intruder</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Goodness!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right, Mr Graydon.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Grrr...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The only person who could possibly have shot Mr Windibank that night...is you!

</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Ha ha ha ha ha... You little upstart! You made a grave mistake when you <span style="color:#E16935">summoned</span> me here.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? <span style="color:#0070C0">(What's that supposed to mean?)</span>
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes, as you rightly say, I was there at the pawnbroker's. I did my best to hide the fact, naturally. I had no intention of ruining the distinguished career I'd built for myself at the communication station. But did the thought never cross your mind? Did you never consider the possibility?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What, what do you mean? What thought? What possibility?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
The possibility that if I was there at the scene... I may have witnessed <span style="color:#E16935">the crucial moment</span>. You see... ...this makes me <span style="color:#E16935">a key witness</span> in this case...and I have my hands firmly around the neck of your client!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Are, are you suggesting...?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
I saw it all! I saw <span style="color:#E16935">the very moment</span> that pickpocket girl pointed the gun at that poor, defenceless pawnbroker...and shot him!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You... WHAAAAAAAAT?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Well... ...it would seem we are finally entering the last act of this theatrical trial.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Mr Graydon...
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I trust you are fully aware of the implications here? If it is shown that <span style="color:#E16935">your claim is false</span>... ...you will have <span style="color:#E16935">incriminated</span> yourself as the killer.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
......... Oh, I understand fully.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Then I must ask you to give your formal testimony once more. You will explain to the court <span style="color:#E16935">precisely what you saw</span> at the moment the defendant allegedly shot the victim.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...Nothing would give me greater pleasure.

<span style="color:#E16935">- The Moment of the Shooting -</span></center>
<p>Graydon:<br />
While these ruffians were jostling with the broker, I was still near the entrance to the shop.<br />
When Windibank threw Nash over the counter, I felt a sharp pain in my arm.<br />
I pursued the man but he shut himself in the storeroom. I could see him through the peephole in the door, though.<br />
The accused, in a black coat, shot the man in the back as he was trying to flee to safety!<br />
I saw the blood spatter all over that wretched girl.<br />
Then she tossed the gun out of the peephole. So I picked it up...and made my escape.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious! This, this is quite extraordinary testimony!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You claim, sir - under oath - to have clearly seen the defendant pulling the trigger! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
It wasn't my intention to testify in this way. But neither is it my intention to be found guilty of a murder I didn't commit. So you see...my hand has been forced. I tell the truth now as an act of self-preservation.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! The truth?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Until now, the prosecution was completely unaware of these details.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes...well, um...sorry about that.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Having shot me in the arm, the pawnbroker was then shot in the back by the accused. And as I said...she was showered in his blood.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You say <span style="color:#E16935">the blood</span> splattered over the accused's coat? Are you sure on that point?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Oh yes. Quite sure. All over the black overcoat that pickpocket girl was wearing at the time.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Really? If her coat could somehow be shown to harbour vestiges of blood, that would be conclusive evidence here!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Such an investigation is entirely <span style="color:#E16935">possible</span>, My Lord.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Only very recently, a German scientist has developed a technique to identify human blood. So here's to true science...not some amateurish detective's dubious foray into the world of chemistry.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
There's nothing dubious about Hurley's work! His ideas are all sound!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Ideas are no use to us here. In science, as in law, theories must be proven before they stand.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
In Germany, the technique has already been employed in the courtroom as the basis of evidence. Scotland Yard has a small quantity of the chemical reagent used. With Your Lordship's permission... ...we could shatter all vestiges of doubt within minutes!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
This doesn't look good, Runo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Why not?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, we know, don't we? That there's <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span> all over the front of Ginny's coat. If they test it with their chemicals...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh help! You're right! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I was forgetting what happened yesterday...)</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Looking for the music box, of course.)</span>
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
The broker went for Nash in the first place. Then Ringo joined in, making it two against one. So I assumed they could handle the situation. But I was wrong.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You mean that's the moment you were shot?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes. Though I didn't immediately realise what had happened, of course. Things crashed to the floor from the counter as the three men were brawling. It was at exactly that moment that it happened. So I didn't hear the gunshot.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And the bullet went on to strike the calendar in the wall behind you...
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
So it would appear. When I looked at my arm, I saw it was bleeding badly. So I wrapped my handkerchief around it. Seeing as I couldn't explain what had happened to a doctor, I had no choice but to wait for it to heal. I didn't imagine it would still be bleeding two days later.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Did Mr Windibank intend to shoot you, do you think?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Well now...I don't imagine he even noticed I was there, to be honest. Perhaps the gun went off accidentally. Anyway, it didn't quite strike home.

And what about this '<span style="color:#E16935">peephole in the door</span>' you mentioned?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Well, unsurprisingly, the storeroom door's a solid job. Made of stout wood. But there's <span style="color:#E16935">a small openin'</span> in it about head height that lets you see what's what in there from the outside.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Hm...

Inside the storeroom, I could see the broker and that young girl standing there.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The defendant?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes. Though neither of them noticed that I was looking. The girl raised her gun and pointed it straight at the man.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, when the crime was discovered, the defendant was found with a gun in her hand. But that was Mr Windibank's gun, from which only a single bullet had been fired. And as we've clearly established, Mr Graydon, that bullet was fired at you!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Ah, but no... It wasn't the broker's gun that the pickpocket girl had when I saw her. Yes, the bullet from Windibank's gun grazed my arm... And yes, the Skulkins' gun grounded the detective... But this...was another gun entirely. A third gun.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The broker's gun was not the murder weapon. So clearly there had to be a third firearm involved. In other words, the accused must have had her own gun with her at the time.

In the direction of the storeroom door. To where I was watching. Of course, I quickly retreated. And then... ...the girl dropped the gun through the peephole onto the floor on my side of the door.

But why on earth would she do such a thing?

The report, please, Inspector.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes, sir! 'Traces of <span style="color:#E16935">human blood</span> were found on the overcoat of the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade. From the extent of the stains, it would appear that they were the result of <span style="color:#E16935">spattering</span> following a gunshot wound.' ...End of report!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No! <span style="color:#E16935">The blood</span> on that coat is not Mr Windibank's!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What on earth makes you say that, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The coat originally belonged to Magnus McGilded. Just before his coat was deposited at Windibank's, McGilded had fatally stabbed Mr Mason Milverton. So the blood on that overcoat...is <span style="color:#E16935">the blood</span> of the brickmaker from the omnibus case!

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Well...the dead cannot speak. ...Isn't that right, my Nipponese friend?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Two months ago in this very courtroom... ...did you not argue fervently for McGilded's innocence? And yet now that the man is dead...you brand him as a murderer? Your conduct shatters any shred of respect you may have earnt for yourself in this country!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh! But, but that was...
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
I call it a bally disgrace! Treachery, that's what it is!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Hm, how to determine whether <span style="color:#E16935">the blood</span> on that coat is two months old or not...? Even a stereoscope couldn't help the answer to that problem pop out. It can't be done!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...but... ...we used Mr Sholmes's specially formulated chemicals-
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Mr Sholmes is a detective, not a chemist!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Would you put such faith in a chemical formula devised by me, for example, when I'm a communications officer?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I held out pirozhki to starving boy, and he ran away crying.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Herlock Sholmes is barely more than a figment of the public's imagination. His name carries no weight in this courtroom! ...No weight at all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How could you say that?!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...Victory is sweet indeed. This proves that my testimony is <span style="color:#E16935">the whole truth</span> from start to finish!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
How do you arrive at such a conclusion, sir?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As the witness said, the accused's coat was <span style="color:#E16935">spattered with the blood of the victim</span>. The only way Mr Graydon could possibly have known that fact, is if he saw it happen. In other words...his testimony is solid, and the conclusion is singular: It was the accused who shot the victim in this case. That...is <span style="color:#E16935">the whole truth</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
AAAAAAAAARGH!
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>My Lord!</center>
<p><br />
Juror No. 1:<br />
Been a long battle, this one, but this old warhorse has something to say now, if you please.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mr Foreman...?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
As of this moment, sir, the squadron has reached its final decision. Ready, men? All for one now!
</p>
<center>SIR!</center>
<p><br />
Juror No. 1:<br />
Guilty!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />

</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Guilty!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, it would appear the ladies and gentlemen of the jury have reached a unanimous verdict.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The defence has consistently failed to unpick this witness's testimony. Here's to any attempt you may make at unpicking the jurors' decisions being...equally successful.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't believe it... After I've come so far... How is it all <span style="color:#E16935">unravelling</span> on me so fast...?)</span> .........

<p><br />
Bailiff:<br />
Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Officer...? You've delivered the report now. That will be all, thank you.
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
It occurs to me with some regularity, Mr Naruhodo... ...that scientific truths are determined not by science... ...but by none other than <span style="color:#E16935">the human mind</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I, I know that voice...)</span> Am I going mad...? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr Sholmes!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wha...? WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What business do you have here, detective? The last I heard, you were recuperating in hospital.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As well I would be...had I not been set upon <span style="color:#E16935">an errand</span>.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What errand?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hurley! It's really you! You're awake at last!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, good day, Iris. I appear to be rather late to rise. My apologies. Now, My Lord...if you will humour me?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In what manner, sir?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I have something of great importance I wish to give to the young lawyer over there. I need no more than five minutes. Would you be so kind as to spare us the time?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... What say you to this, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... This trial has taken many hours of the court's time. Having spent so long already-
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Exactly! Havin' spent so long already, we don't wanna go wastin' any more precious time!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As I was saying... Having spent so long already, it would seem churlish to deny the defence a mere five minutes.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
EEEEEEEEEHHH?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well then. Counsel, you have five minutes.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Sholmes:<br />
My dear fellow, I apologise for my tardy arrival.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Sholmes! Are you alright now?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Alright? I'm all wrong!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I've only just managed to summon the strength to stand, man! I asked the judge for five minutes... ...but I fear even that may prove too much for me. Pray forgive me should I pass out.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...let's make this discussion as short as possible.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hurley, this place is full of idiots! None of them can see how wonderful your chemical blood analysis is!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah well...that concoction of mine was really just a bit of sport to assist me in my investigations. I never took the trouble to refine it for appraisal by the scientific community. ...An oversight on my part.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Right... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Modesty? Surely not...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But enough of that. I'm here to give you this, my dear fellow.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's that? <span style="color:#0070C0">(A lavender furoshiki wrapping...?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
A leaving present. From Miss Susato.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
From Miss Susato?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
If possible, matters were to be settled without me giving you this. Those were her instructions when she asked me to do her this <span style="color:#E16935">favour</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I...I don't understand.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Miss Susato foresaw today's events, I believe. She knew that the culprit would attempt to escape justice by means both devious and underhand. And that you, Mr Naruhodo, fighting fairly as you are wont to do, would find yourself in considerable peril. At that very moment of crisis, you were to be given this small parcel. Those were the dear lady's instructions.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(<span style="color:#E16935">A leaving present</span> from Susato-san... Whatever could it be?)</span> What is this?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh! It's...it's the machine I made!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Wagahai:<br />
Miaow.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Look! I used this! It's my latest invention! 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What...what is that?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I call it...the Cat-Flapomat! It can make a cat flap for a little furry friend like Waggy in seconds!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Iris:<br />
What's Susie up to?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Miss Susato muttered the following words before she left: 'I'm a failure. I don't deserve to be a judicial assistant.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Didn't she say something like that...?)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You really are the best judicial assistant in the world.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well...that's extremely flattering. But I'm sorry to say... ...that I've been a complete failure.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Whatever did she mean by that, Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... That night, when you left Windibank's in pursuit of the thieves... ...Miss Susato made use of this contraption for...<span style="color:#E16935">a certain purpose</span>. That is your answer, dear fellow.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Not, not at all cryptic then... Susato-san <span style="color:#E16935">used</span> this Cat-Flapomat that night? But why?)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The Cat-Flapomat has been entered into the Court Record.</span>

Counsel, you must choose but <span style="color:#E16935">one</span> statement from the witness's testimony... ...and but <span style="color:#E16935">one</span> piece of evidence to present in support of your argument against it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A single chance to present <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If, following that, the situation remains unchanged, I shall move to adjudication. Is that clear, Counsels? You will not press the witness any further!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My Lord.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm... A single statement and a single piece of evidence. ...Most generous. Well then, Mr Naruhodo. It's high time I...fell in a dead faint. I leave this...in your capable hands...

<p>Judge:<br />
To stand so insouciantly before the court in a state of such high fever... Either the man has extraordinary strength of mind, or an extraordinary lack of feeling.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I imagine he's feeling very little now. The detective is sleeping soundly in one of the antechambers.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Strike a man when he's down, why don't you?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well then, Counsel...are you fully prepared?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes. <span style="color:#0070C0">(One <span style="color:#E16935">statement</span>... One piece of <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>... I won't let Mr Sholmes down. Or Iris. And I won't waste this final chance that Susato-san has given me. This is going to decide the entire outcome of the trial!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, then. Under the terms I have outlined...you may resume the cross-examination!

<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
What on earth is that eccentric <span style="color:#E16935">contraption</span>, Counsel?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ooh, it's my Cat-Flapomat, My Lord! It makes <span style="color:#E16935">a way for cats to get in and out</span> of a room. It can cut through any door you can think of and make a new little <span style="color:#E16935">door</span> in the middle of it!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right, My Lord. It's a device for creating so-called 'cat flaps': Small doors for cats to come and go as they please without their owners having to open the main door-
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
I'm sure we can all work that out for ourselves!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
But that cat-lover's contrivance has no possible relevance to this case!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh really?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Of course it doesn't! To start with, there was no cat flap in the pawnbroker's door.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... ...not being a keeper of cats myself, I'm afraid I fail to see what this has to do with the matter at hand.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Perhaps it would help if I described its function another way, then. This contraption... ...is able to create <span style="color:#E16935">a peephole</span> in any door you can imagine in practically no time at all.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I, I beg your pardon? <span style="color:#E16935">A peephole</span>, you say?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Two nights ago... ...we arrived at the scene only minutes after the murder of Mr Windibank had taken place.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That's right. According to the paperwork at the Yard, it was you, your Japanese assistant and Sholmes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, the three of us were together. And it's recently come to my attention... ...that my assistant <span style="color:#E16935">made use</span> of this device at the time.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Your assistant did what?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There was <span style="color:#E16935">a peephole</span> in the storeroom door. I can attest to that. Because I looked through <span style="color:#E16935">the peephole</span> myself, in order to see inside the locked storeroom.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
This is ludicrous! What are you trying to say? Of course there was <span style="color:#E16935">a peephole</span> in the door. I said as much in my testimony! How else could I have <span style="color:#E16935">witnessed</span> the crime, for pity's sake?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Yes...how could you?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Counsel, kindly say what you mean.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright, it's time... Time to strike the final blow...)</span> What I mean is this, My Lord! My assistant made <span style="color:#E16935">the peephole</span> in the storeroom door. And until such time as she did... ...the door had <span style="color:#E16935">no hole</span> in it to look through!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Wha...? NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
This is a farce! Are you really suggesting that <span style="color:#E16935">the peephole</span> in the door was...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, it was created only after the incident had taken place. By my judicial assistant, <span style="color:#E16935">using this device</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Your assistant tampered with the crime scene, whilst being fully aware of the gravity of her actions? That is a most serious <span style="color:#E16935">act of vandalism</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
For which I humbly apologise, My Lord! It was in the few minutes that I left the scene in order to pursue the Skulkin brothers and alert the police. Nevertheless! In the light of this new information... ...it becomes apparent that Mr Graydon's testimony... ...is <span style="color:#E16935">riddled with holes</span>!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Riddled with...? Explain yourself, Counsel!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The majority of Mr Graydon's testimony that appears to incriminate the defendant... ...is based upon what he witnessed through <span style="color:#E16935">the peephole</span> in the storeroom door.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes... That filthy girl shooting the man in the back!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
However...if at the time of the incident... ...that <span style="color:#E16935">peephole</span> did not yet exist in the door... ...there's <span style="color:#E16935">no possible way</span> that you could have seen what you claim to have seen!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Grrr...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In short... ...your entire testimony...is <span style="color:#E16935">a pack of lies</span>!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Ugh!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Is, is there any credence in this revelation?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
None whatsoever! ...As my learned friend must surely realise.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Ex-Exactly! This is just some cheap trick designed to discredit me!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm afraid not, sir.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Of course it is! Do you seriously expect people to believe that plaything can <span style="color:#E16935">cut through a solid wooden door</span>?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh yes! I designed it to be very powerful. It can cut through even the toughest of doors!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
That's absurd! I don't believe it for a second!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Haha, I had a feeling you'd say that.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
What?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Waggy! Cooey! Time for dinner!
</p><p>Miaow...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Young lady! This is the Old Bailey! One does not make cat flaps in the oak panelling at the Old Bailey!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
I'm...I'm not done yet, don't worry! This doesn't mean that the peephole in the storeroom door at Windibank's was made by your machine. And there's no way you can prove that it was!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
No? But it's easy.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
The cat flaps my Cat-Flapomat creates are all of a fixed size. And the dimensions of the peephole at Windibank's are an exact match.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Ugh! .........
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hee hee! Old Silky's lost for words!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Excellent work, Iris. Thank you!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And now it's my learned student friend's turn to be lost for words, I feel.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I believe your judicial assistant has already left the country for your Eastern island home.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...yes, that's true.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Then you may have some difficulty in establishing all of the facts. For the sake of argument, let us assume the peephole has dimensions that are a perfect fit for this contraption. In that case, <span style="color:#E16935">when</span> was the peephole cut? ...The prosecution demands proof of your answer.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What is the purpose of your line of enquiry, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It's very simple, My Lord. The defence argues that the peephole was created <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> the incident using this device. But now that the perpetrator has returned to her native land, she cannot testify to the fact. There is no proof.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And for as long as the defence remains unable to prove when the peephole was made... ...my learned friend's claim amounts to nothing more...than <span style="color:#E16935">a baseless accusation</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
WHAAAAAAAAT?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed that is so, Lord van Zieks. ...Well, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, um...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Don't give up now, Runo! This is the time to create your own opening and force your way through!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't know if I can do this. But I do know one thing... Susato-san is <span style="color:#E16935">the greatest judicial assistant</span> in the world!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. The counsel for the defence will present evidence to support the claim made. <span style="color:green">Proof that the peephole in the door of Windibank's storeroom was created after the event and not before!</span>

</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well she wouldn't have left you in the lurch, would she? You can be sure she thought of a way to prove what you're being asked to prove now. So there must be some evidence in the Court Record somewhere that will do the trick.

<p>Van Zieks:<br />
What are you...? A print from that detective's infernal cameras, again?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My judicial assistant - Miss Susato Mikotoba - is an extremely intelligent and capable woman. Which is why I never had any cause to doubt... ...that she would have considered this scenario, and made sure I had the necessary <span style="color:#E16935">proof</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And the necessary proof is this <span style="color:#E16935">photographic print</span>, Counsel?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This print shows a scene in the shop moments after the defendant entered the premises.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Agreed. And it also shows the accused mercilessly wielded a gun in the direction of the defenceless broker.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but more to the point... ...it pictures <span style="color:#E16935">the storeroom door</span> in the background!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Let me see that print again!
</p>
<center>......... I, I don't believe it!</center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
This really is quite remarkable! The door to the storeroom... ...is completely <span style="color:#E16935">devoid</span> of a peephole of any description!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Graydon!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You couldn't possibly have witnessed the crime as you claim to have done. Because at the time it happened...<span style="color:#E16935">there was no peephole</span> in the door.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In other words, your <span style="color:#E16935">testimony</span>... ...is a catalogue of <span style="color:#E16935">lies</span>!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Nrgh...urgn...grr... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! I am satisfied that the defence has substantiated its claim beyond all reasonable doubt. This witness's testimony was entirely fallacious!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
That's not the only thing we now know beyond all reasonable doubt. My learned friend's assistant's guilt can no longer be denied. The woman tampered with a crime scene!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But more importantly...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good Lord! There's more, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The defence may have established a reprehensible instance of <span style="color:#E16935">perjury</span>... ...but that is no proof that this man is the victim's killer.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes... That's right...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
I was there at the scene, it's true. And I was shot in the arm, it's true. ...But that's all. Yes, in fact, if you look at the circumstances... I am the victim here!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh please... NOOOOOOOOO! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't believe this. But they're right. As it stands now... ...I don't have any definitive <span style="color:#E16935">proof</span> that he is the culprit.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Still...he can't worm his way out of it now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You know what they say: There's no point locking the cat's door...after the cat has bolted. Isn't that right, Runo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
As Hurley always says: 'One lie begets another.' No, wait... That might have been a line I wrote for him in one of my stories.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Well, no matter who said it first, you're right. Mr Graydon... Not only did you give false testimony to the court... ...but the lies you told <span style="color:#E16935">make no sense</span>.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
'Make no sense'? What do you mean by such a remark?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What you said in your testimony... ...reveals that you know <span style="color:#E16935">something you shouldn't have known</span>. In other words...there is a fundamental <span style="color:#E16935">inconsistency</span> in your statements!

And once I returned to the shop having failed to catch the two burglars... ...Scotland Yard's investigators arrived immediately. Since that time, the police have been at Windibank's constantly, carrying out their <span style="color:#E16935">investigation</span>. ...Isn't that right, Inspector Gregson?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Um, well... Yes, of course, erm... ...the place is chock-full of pawned articles and my lads have to thoroughly examine them all. So I gave the order to have officers workin' around the clock in shifts so we get through it all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And consequently there's no way that you, Mr Graydon, could have gained access to the shop.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Therefore! You should have known nothing about the peephole in the storeroom door. So the fact that its existence forms the basis of your testimony...is completely <span style="color:#E16935">inexplicable</span>!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And yet...the fact remains that Mr Graydon did maintain... ...that he <span style="color:#E16935">witnessed</span> the crime take place through the peephole in the door.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
How on earth is that possible?
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>Um...</center>
<p><br />
Gregson:<br />
...Could I have a word, please, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Speak, Inspector.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
It's just that I really ought to be gettin' back to the station now to put in my report. There's really nothin' more I can add to this testimony, so if it's all the same to you...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Permission denied.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It's not all the same to me, Inspector. Not at all. You will remain exactly where you are until this trial concludes.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... Of, of course, sir.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Graydon...
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You shouldn't have known about the existence of that peephole. Which can only mean... ...that you must have <span style="color:#E16935">been informed about it</span> by somebody else.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Ugh...

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Stop there, my learned friend. You realise, I trust, that the words you just uttered have extremely serious implications.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes. But the defence believes that the details about the case that Mr Graydon claims to have seen... ...must have been revealed to him by <span style="color:#E16935">a certain person</span> before his testimony. <span style="color:#0070C0">(And, in fact... ...considering a particular clue we have, there's really only <span style="color:#E16935">one person</span> that could be!)</span>

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You had better have some proof to substantiate such a rash claim, my learned friend.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Consider the fact... ...that we have only been aware of Mr Ashley Graydon's identity for the last few hours. We learnt of it only during the course of the trial today.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed. Preparations for his testimony were made with great urgency during our hour-long recess. While the police executed the subpoena and brought the man here from the communications station.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And until that time, Mr Graydon would have had no idea. No inkling that he would suddenly be required to appear in court.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Are you suggesting that until such time as he was summoned...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord. Until then, it's reasonable to assume he <span style="color:#E16935">knew nothing</span> of the peephole. It was only once Mr Graydon was in the stand that he realised his position. That he would have to defend himself against the accusation that he was <span style="color:#E16935">the third intruder</span>.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You're suggesting to the court that it was while this trial was in progress that he received the information?! So that he could commit <span style="color:#E16935">perjury</span> in order to save his skin!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Exactly. And <span style="color:#E16935">the only person</span> with knowledge of the investigation that he had any contact with... ...is you, Inspector Gregson!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
This, this is a bloomin' outrage! Why would I be givin' away details of our investigations to this fella, eh?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I was summoned to His Lordship's chambers durin' the recess in any case! Had you forgotten that?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Quite true. I had a number of questions regarding the events that transpired at the pawnbrokery.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Which means... ...the first time these two laid eyes on one another was <span style="color:#E16935">after proceedings resumed</span> following the recess. Since then, they've been in full view in the stand, where such illicit <span style="color:#E16935">discussions</span> couldn't possibly have occurred!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ooh...I've just remembered something, Runo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What is it, Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
There was one time before, wasn't there? I think it was when Ginny was testifying.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Oh yes, now you mention it... ...when the bailiff was dispatched to retrieve McGilded's <span style="color:#E16935">music box</span> from the scene of the crime... That's it! <span style="color:#0070C0">(It was during that testimony! I remember finding it strange at the time. Mr Graydon and the inspector seemed to be having some kind of secret discussion.)</span> It would have been possible for you to give Mr Graydon the information he needed then.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
You little toerag! You're makin' all this up! I'm, I'm a respectable Scotland Yard inspector for cryin' out loud! Why would I do somethin' like that? Why would I be givin' away <span style="color:#E16935">confidential details</span> to the likes of this bloke?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Admittedly, you wouldn't have had any <span style="color:#E16935">reason</span> to do something like that for no gain. But perhaps... ...it was part of <span style="color:#E16935">a deal</span> of some kind. Then it starts to make more sense.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...! What <span style="color:#E16935">deal</span>, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I wonder if perhaps, in exchange for details about the peephole at the crime scene... ...Mr Graydon agreed to give <span style="color:#E16935">a certain something</span> to the inspector.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
...!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I'm sure I need not remind the inspector that, if found to be true, striking <span style="color:#E16935">a deal</span> of any kind with a witness... ...would be considered a gross case of <span style="color:#E16935">malfeasance</span>!

It's becoming clear... ...that jumping in with accusations is this Nipponese student's speciality.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I don't do that!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But with the stakes so high, the prosecution is not prepared to listen to baseless charges. It is incumbent on the defence now to present evidence in support of this diabolical claim.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
E-Evidence...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Just what are you proposing that the inspector <span style="color:#E16935">demanded</span> of the witness in return? The court must see proof of this alleged <span style="color:#E16935">deal</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If Inspector Gregson really did <span style="color:#E16935">strike a deal</span> with Mr Graydon... ...then logically, there's only one thing he could have <span style="color:#E16935">asked for</span>... That MUST be it!)</span>

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Inspector Gregson! Besides this murder, is it not true that you've been working on another, <span style="color:#E16935">very important case</span>?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
What...are you gettin' at now, sunshine?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Is it possible that this other, top-secret case... ...is what's alluded to in this newspaper article here? The classified secrets being leaked overseas from the Ministry of Justice...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
How, how the bleedin' Nora could you...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We discovered, during the course of this trial, the music box deposited at Windibank's by Magnus McGilded. A special music box, designed to play two disks at once. It would seem very likely now, that encoded on <span style="color:#E16935">the pair of disks</span> that were in McGilded's possession... ...are the leaked classified secrets.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So I put it to you, Inspector...that in order to recover the second of the disks containing those secrets... ...you covertly made a deal with Mr Graydon in which you exchanged the disk for details of the case!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
You... You little... AAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
On the day of the incident... ...when we met you at Windibank's, you said this:
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gregson:<br />
I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Scotland Yard already knew at that time, isn't that right? That Magnus McGilded was involved in <span style="color:#E16935">the stealing of government secrets</span>!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... My orders were: Recover <span style="color:#E16935">the medium</span> used to convey the secrets leaked from the ministry... ...and do it on the q.t. Strictly hush-hush.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And that explains why, when I presented this disk as evidence to the court... ...you objected so heavily, I presume? Because you knew that it contained highly confidential information.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Blimey, not likely! I mean, I wasn't that sure of it myself. I realised there was a possibility, that's all.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Inspector, surely... Surely you're not saying that in order to acquire the second of these music box disks... ...you did indeed reveal confidential <span style="color:#E16935">details of the crime scene</span> to the witness? To aid and abet this man in giving false testimony?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There's no other way that Mr Graydon could have known of the existence of the peephole. It's the only explanation. <span style="color:#E16935">A deal</span> was struck between these two men!

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If - and I stress 'if' - this sobering assertion turns out to be founded in truth... ...it would mean that the second disk is, as we speak, here <span style="color:#E16935">in this very courtroom</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wait, what? In, in this room? How could you possibly make a claim like that?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Because Inspector Gregson is a Scotland Yard detective.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
What's that supposed to mean, eh?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As a seasoned policeman, the inspector will have approached this alleged deal with caution. Certainly, he would not have accepted a gentleman's agreement in this matter. No...he would have insisted on having <span style="color:#E16935">the article agreed upon</span> in the palm of his hand.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious! Then...you mean to say... ...Inspector Gregson <span style="color:#E16935">already has</span> the item in question in his possession? He has <span style="color:#E16935">the second disk</span> actually on his person?!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The defence demands that the inspector is searched at once!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Definitely! They could only have struck a deal with each other when Ginny was testifying before. And Gregsy hasn't moved from the witness stand since!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My Lord, please! Order an examination of his personal effects immediately!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... Well, Inspector?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... This young lad wants to tone down his imagination. He's insulted me and my profession quite enough.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
However... ...if it'll put this matter to bed and dispel any doubts about my involvement... ...then I'll happily submit to a body search!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(He's going to agree to it?)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...I presume you're aware of the precipice on which you now teeter, my learned student friend? You've made a most serious <span style="color:#E16935">allegation</span> against Scotland Yard here. If, following the search of the inspector's personal effects, no <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span> is found... ...you will be deemed unfit for court service, this trial will end... ...and my country's government will formally demand of yours that you are <span style="color:#E16935">severely reprimanded</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That sounds serious...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed. To have a visiting student make such defamatory remarks about our country's most senior police force... ...is not something Her Majesty's government will be able to overlook.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You're just threatening Runo because you're scared!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The accusation is beyond serious. You must be prepared for <span style="color:#E16935">grave consequences</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(It's true... I can't imagine Gregson would have accepted a gentleman's agreement for something so critical. The disk must have physically changed hands. Which means the inspector should have it. But somehow...something doesn't feel quite right here...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, Counsel. You know the implications. So let me ask you one final time...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Y-Yes, My Lord!
</p><p>Judge:<br />

<p><br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Another music box <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span>.
</p><p>Nash:<br />

</p><p>Gregson:<br />
.........
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That is the second music box <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span> left behind by Magnus McGilded. Is it not...Inspector Gregson?!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Urgh... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Mr Skulkin, what have you to say for yourself?
</p><p>Nash:<br />
Gordon Bennett! I mean, just...Gordon flamin' Bennett! I swear I didn't know nuffin' about that disk! Honest to God!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Counsel, would you please explain what exactly is going on here? The alleged <span style="color:#E16935">deal</span> that was struck was between this witness... ...and this detective, no?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Without question, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Then for pity's sake... ...why on earth was this man in possession of the disk that the inspector traded for information?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Inspector Gregson is a shrewd, calculating man who rarely loses his composure. But at one particular point in this trial, he exhibited some <span style="color:#E16935">unusual behaviour</span> for a brief moment.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I don't recall. What unusual behaviour?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was...yes, during my cross-examination of Mr Graydon.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Tell me, Mr Graydon, when you left the pawnbrokery that night... ...was it by any chance with <span style="color:#E16935">the second disk</span> in your jacket pocket?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
I admit to nothing of the sort.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
While Mr Graydon answered my questions... ...the inspector appeared to have grabbed Nash Skulkin by his coat and was shaking him violently.
</p><p>Nash:<br />
Yeah! 'E did an' all! Thought me noggin woz gonna fall clean off, I did! I woz wishin' I'd been born as me bruvver, I woz!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And what exactly happened to make the detective attack you like that?
</p><p>Nash:<br />
I ain't got a clue! 'E just suddenly turned an' grabbed me whistle like that an' started shakin' me! 'Why the blazes didn't ya mention the third gun when we got ya down the station?' That's wot 'e said. Yelled it right down my ear 'ole, 'e did! Me 'ead's still throbbin' now!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The way the detective behaved then was extremely out of character. But looking back now...it must have been then that he did it. That was the opportunity Inspector Gregson created for himself in order to <span style="color:#E16935">hide</span> the disk.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well bless my wig! He <span style="color:#E16935">hid</span> it?!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
You...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But I'm afraid I fail to comprehend the motive here. If the detective had acquired the disk he was after... ...why on earth would he then proceed to hide it in another man's pocket? This is a court of law! He could have submitted the item as evidence.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It would appear, My Lord, that the inspector was <span style="color:#E16935">not at liberty</span> to do that.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Whyever not?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As the man himself revealed himself earlier, his current assignment has some...special conditions.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gregson:<br />
......... My orders were: Recover <span style="color:#E16935">the medium</span> used to convey the secrets leaked from the ministry... ...and do it on the q.t. Strictly hush-hush.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
'<span style="color:#E16935">Hush-hush</span>'? A top-secret assignment, is it?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As far as we're aware, the information stolen comes from <span style="color:#E16935">confidential government communications</span>. It would seem that if that information were to be revealed in court as evidence, it would be...<span style="color:#E16935">problematic</span>. ...Does that sum up the situation, Inspector?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... I'm operatin' under direct orders from the ministry. I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to answer that question.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So...realising there was a chance that you may be searched here in court... ...you took steps to hide the disk you had acquired from the witness.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah! Does this mean...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He only pretended to attack Mr Skulkin in order to get close enough to him... ...to slip the second disk into his pocket.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So it was all <span style="color:#E16935">a pretence</span>?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
.........
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well now, Inspector Gregson... And you, Mr Graydon... ...are you prepared to admit to the accusation made against you of this alleged deal?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
......... ...Admit to it? Yours truly? Please...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Graydon!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Clearly our Eastern visitor has an uncommonly active imagination. However, there's no proof that I passed that <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span> to the inspector.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But! But then... ...how do you explain <span style="color:#E16935">the reason why</span> you knew about the peephole?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
I'm under no obligation to explain.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes, I lied in my testimony. That I admit, so sentence me accordingly. But that is all I admit. Murder...? Leaking government secrets...? Striking a deal with the detective...? All of it is this young Eastern man's fancy. I have no idea what any of that is about!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! Well, what about you then, Inspector Gregson? Do you admit to making a deal with Mr Graydon in order to acquire the disk?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
...Ladies and gents of the jury... ...as a Scotland Yard inspector, I will declare this and nothin' more:
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I am actin' in the best interests of the country. Whatever I've done, it's been in the name of <span style="color:#E16935">justice</span>.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
...!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
So, as members of the public of this fine country... ...I'd like to think that justice will be your guidin' light when you're makin' your decisions.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... This is quite a quandary indeed. Rarely have I encountered such extraordinary tumultuousness in the concluding of a trial. Nevertheless, in the absence of any further evidence to be presented... ...I believe it is time that we put the matter to the jury for their final leanings.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Well now...as a fellow servant of Queen and country, I must say I sympathise with the old inspector.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Yes, he's a dependable man, I'm quite sure. In service, one becomes a good judge of character.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Even crossing your eyes doesn't help when it comes to looking at this case. It's all blurred to me...
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Well, as a fellow professional, I'd like to put my faith in the detective, really.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Graydon is highly skilled operator! Stop. Currently in presence of idol! Stop.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...Detective has wery much trust in eyes. More than this, I cannot say.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't believe it! These six jurors are... They're going to believe Gregson! If they declare their decision now...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Is Ginny going to be found guilty?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If I don't manage to produce some definitive evidence right now, then...we're going to lose! Either some proof that Graydon killed Mr Windibank or stole those government secrets... Or some evidence to force Gregson into admitting that he struck a deal with the witness...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well then, Counsel... ...I think it's time I imposed on the jurors to declare their final <span style="color:#E16935">decisions</span>, no? That is, unless you have some compelling <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> you have thus far not presented to the court?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If I let the judge call on the jurors to announce their leanings, Gina will be found <span style="color:#E16935">guilty</span>.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So there's no choice then, Runo! You have to throw some more evidence at them!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is it now. It all comes down to this... Who do I present evidence against? Gregson...or Graydon...?)</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Not true, Inspector!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Eh?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The defence has already proposed... ...that the sounds heard by the court earlier from this music box were part of <span style="color:#E16935">a Morse code</span> message.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We know that Morse code comprises of <span style="color:#E16935">two distinct tones</span>. The defence believes that the second disk contains <span style="color:#E16935">the second tone</span> needed to complete the message! And now we have a chance...to confirm that theory!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
For cryin' out loud, sunshine! We're talkin' about <span style="color:#E16935">state secrets</span> here! If you go lettin' the whole courtroom hear confidential information like that, it's...it's <span style="color:#E16935">treason</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then do you admit the charge? That in order to protect those state secrets, you engaged in <span style="color:#E16935">unlawful dealings</span> with the witness?

Let's not forget, Inspector, that you - a Scotland Yard officer - leaked confidential case details to a witness! That you continue to lie to the court! And all because, by fair means or foul, you're determined to do your duty. Well...by fair means or foul, I'm prepared to do mine!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Don't you dare...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I will stop at nothing to protect my client! I don't care who I make an enemy of!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My Lord! If you please! The court must hear the sounds made by that music box!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Come on, van Zieks! For Pete's sake! Stop 'im!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Inspector, you should know my methods by now. I'm a prosecutor. ...I'm no Scotland Yard puppet.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Ugrk...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
In this courtroom, my duty is to the law. So let me propose a toast. To uncovering the truth...by fair means or foul.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
NOOOOOOOOO!!!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, the defence's stance here and that of the prosecution has been made very clear, I feel. Therefore...in accordance with the defence's request... ...the court will now listen as this music box is set in operation once more. This time...with the second disk in place, and both disks playing <span style="color:#E16935">simultaneously</span>...
</p>
<hr />
<center>.........<br />
Oh, listen to that... It's...it's unmistakable now... It's Morse code!</center>
<p><br />

</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Alright, alright! I admit it! Whatever you want! But for the love of God... ...shut that bloomin' box up!!!
</p>
<center>.........</center>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Let me ask you again then, Inspector Gregson... Did you, or did you not, strike a deal with the witness next to you in the stand, Mr Ashley Graydon?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Specifically, did you furnish the witness with confidential case details in exchange for this music box disk? Did you reveal the existence of the peephole in the pawnbroker's storeroom door, Inspector?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... I did.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
...! Stop! What are you doing, man?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... It's all exactly like the young Eastern lawyer said. When the trial resumed after the recess, and we were stood here in the stand together... ...that's when he approached me with the deal.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Shut up, you imbecile! SHUT UP!!!
</p>
<hr />
<center>Psst, you there... You're the detective who turned up at the pawnbrokery the other day, aren't you? I may have something you're looking for, Inspector. With me at this very moment. So how about a trade? I suggest you accept... ...or information that may make certain individuals uncomfortable will soon become very public indeed.</center>
<hr />
<p>Gregson:<br />
I couldn't let that information become public knowledge. Not under any circumstances. So I accepted the man's proposal, and told him details about the case that should've put him in the clear. The peephole in the storeroom door...and the bloodstains on the overcoat.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
By giving false testimony, this witness intended to have the defendant wrongly accused of murder. Inspector, you knew that! Yet you still revealed those details to facilitate the witness's perjury!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... I did. But then it turned out the peephole had only been made that night, after the incident took place. Scotland Yard wasn't aware of that, if I'm perfectly honest.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, Mr Graydon? What do you have to say for yourself?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Uh...ugh...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There's nothing and no one left for you to hide behind. You struck a deal with the inspector in order to escape conviction of a very serious crime. Namely this... You are the third intruder who broke into the pawnbrokery on the night in question... ...and YOU perpetrated the murder of the proprietor, Mr Pop Windibank!
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Nrgh... You... You... TRAITOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Bailiff! BAILIFF!!! Restrain that man! At once!
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:#0070C0">(That's it then. It's all over...)</span><br />
<p>...........................<br />
..................<br />
</p>
.........</center>
<p><br />
I despised my life growing up. Those slums are vile places. I was cursed from birth. Born into poverty, the son of a penniless artisan. My parents did nothing but quarrel all day long. What little money they had was never spent on me.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
So I set about studying. To better myself. To one day escape from that hellhole.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And you eventually became a communications officer. ...I admire your determination.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But then you decided to try to sell government secrets? Why?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
......... Isn't it obvious? Because I wanted money. Even now, years later, the nightmares of my life in the slums wake me in the small hours. I wanted to drown them out. With more money than anyone who lived in that squalor could ever imagine. Then one day, I met him. Mr Magnus McGilded.
</p>
<hr />
<p>McGilded:
</p>
<center>Yer a feen with a quare talent, so you are. I've money to throw yer way if yer interested. All ye need to do...is go along with me little plan now.</center>
<hr />
<p>Graydon:<br />
I was to steal the ministry's telegraphic message logs and McGilded would buy them for a handsome sum. As I was responsible for inspections of the ministry's communications office, it was a simple enough task.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The lure of the devil's offerings... How easy it is to succumb.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But you must surely have realised the seriousness of the crime you were committing.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
And for that reason, I took great lengths to ensure that my actions were untraceable.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
By using the music box.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
......... My father was a brickmaker. Though my mother divorced him when I was still a child.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, Mr Mason Milverton.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
That's right. He was very skilled with his hands. He'd once been a music box maker's apprentice. I imagined his skills would be sufficient to create a machine that could generate Morse code. So I sought out my father again...to employ his services. It was the first time I'd seen him since I left the slums ten years earlier.
</p>
<hr />
<p>'Look at you, Ashley. What a fine gent you've become, eh?'
</p><p>Graydon:
</p>
<center>He was a different man to the one in my memory. A thin, frail old man. But poverty had never broken him. Never corrupted him like it had me. I was sure that he wouldn't help me if I told him the real reason. So I made up a story.</center>
<p><br />
'I've got some work for you, Father. I need some music box disks made.'
</p><p>'Music box disks, eh?'
</p><p>'A musician friend of mine has written some music he wants to sell to the public. I've brought the score with me. There are two, actually.'
</p><p>'I'd be delighted, son. ...It's been twenty years since I did any work like this, though. Fetch my tools, would you? They're in the loft.'
</p>
<hr />
<p>Graydon:<br />
That's how I had him make the two disks.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Thereby splitting the information in two... You were taking considerable precautions indeed.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
It was to protect myself as much as anything. It meant that I could deal with McGilded in two separate transactions. The first involved the first of the two disks and the music box for playing them. I exchanged them with McGilded for ten guineas. Then, on receipt of the second disk, he would pay a thousand guineas.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...what happened on the omnibus two months ago... ...was the second part of a deal? The exchange of the second disk?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes. I'd sold the man information that way a number of times already. But it seems he became reluctant to part with his money.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But that doesn't quite make sense, Mr Graydon. For why was it that on the omnibus two months ago... ...your father, Mr Milverton, was the one dealing with Mr McGilded and not yourself?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
When I received the thousand guineas after my first completed dealings with McGilded... ...I decided to give two hundred to my father for his troubles.
</p>
<center>But my father realised something was amiss. In time, he worked out that I must be involved in something...dubious. And when he did, he said to me:</center>
<hr />
<p>'Next time there's an exchange, you'll let your old man do it, understand? Otherwise I won't take your money any more.'
</p>
<center>.........</center>
<hr />
<p>Graydon:<br />
...That was my father's way of dealing with it, I suppose. 'Climb into the omnibus, hand over the second disk, and take the money from McGilded. That's it.' He had no idea what was actually on the disks I'd asked him to make. He never knew. ...Just like I'll never know why everything went so horribly wrong that night. All I know is that the disk was taken from him... and he never returned home.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
It was only then that I found out what sort of a monster McGilded really was. So after ten years of not once uttering it, I swore on my father's name... ...to exact revenge.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Revenge?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...As anyone with even the remotest knowledge of the man will no doubt be able to imagine... ...McGilded brought all his wealth and influence to bear in the most despicable of ways... ...to crush any semblance of justice in his trial.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The crime scene was tampered with, evidence was fixed, and witnesses were bribed. That trial two months ago was a farce from start to finish.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(My feet had barely touched British soil back then. And I walked into that hornets' nest, completely unaware of the sinister background to it all...)</span>
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
I'd made plenty of money out of my dealings with McGilded by then. So I spared nothing in my arrangements two months ago. I knew exactly who to hire. If you're willing to pay the price, there are people in this city willing to do anything you ask. McGilded himself had shown me that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Are, are you saying that...?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
I think you have the picture now. After he twisted everything to his favour in this courtroom to ensure that he walked free... ...I took matters into my own hands...and delivered the justice that monster deserved!
</p>
<center>That 'tragic accident' following the trial here two months ago... ...was planned and executed... by yours truly.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(McGilded's death that day... ...was caused by this man!)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Bailiff:<br />
Everything is ready, sir. If you'd like to follow me into the courtroom...
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
What's this, Officer? 'Tis sooner than I was led to believe.
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
I hope it's not inconvenient, sir. There were some changes to the schedule.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Well, I must be makin' tracks now. 'Tis time for the inspection. They're goin' to examine the omnibus again, so I'm told. I asked if I could be present for it meself.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So that policeman who came to tell McGilded he could examine the omnibus again...
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
That's right. An imposter, hired by me. McGilded used his wealth to manipulate the trial. He paid people to adulterate the omnibus with all manner of false evidence... He threatened witnesses to lie in their testimony... So I gave the man a taste of his own medicine. Once the omnibus was dowsed in paraffin... ...one of my sham policemen ushered McGilded inside... and sent him on a one-way journey to Hell. An eye...for an eye. That's how I avenged my father's death.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...A spine-chilling account indeed.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
But that wasn't the end of it for me. There was a loose end, you see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A loose end?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes. I should think it's obvious. <span style="color:#E16935">The second disk</span>, which my father had taken to exchange with McGilded.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah...yes... There was indeed no mention of it in the man's trial two months ago. Clearly because it had been <span style="color:#E16935">removed</span> from the scene of the crime.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
When I realised it was missing, I remembered something. Something from the first time I'd dealt with McGilded.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Graydon:
</p>
<center>'This is the first of the two disks, and the music box you need to play them.'</center>
<p><br />
McGilded:
</p>
<center>'Well, look at that now. What an ingenious little invention. So then, as promised... Ten guineas for ye, young man.'</center>
<p><br />
Graydon:
</p>
<center>'Wh-What's this? "Windibank's Pawnbrokery"?'</center>
<p><br />
McGilded:
</p>
<center>'Aye, 'tis a pawnbroker's ticket, so it is. Ye can use it to redeem an article I've deposited there for ye. There's no need to give a name. Just hand over the ticket and tell the feen the watchword. I've put a jewel in pawn for ye. It'll fetch a good ten guineas if ye sell it, so it will.'</center>
<p><br />
Graydon:
</p>
<center>'...I've never heard of a pawnbrokery being used in quite that way before.'</center>
<p><br />
McGilded:
</p>
<center>'Have ye not, Mr Graydon? London's pawnbrokeries are very useful places, ye know. Each one is like an extremely secure vault.'
...........................<br />..................<br />.........</center>
<hr />
<p>Graydon:<br />
So I knew that if he'd taken steps to hide the disk... ...it would be in that pawnbrokery somewhere. And that on the night he killed my father, he must have entrusted the ticket to someone.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, to Gina.)</span> I remember now...that when we first met you at Windibank's that afternoon two days ago... ...you had a description of Miss Lestrade written down. How did you know who you were looking for?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
From the trial. That pickpocket's testimony was clearly peculiar. Anyone could see that. I realised immediately that she was another of McGilded's pawns. That he must have threatened her somehow. I was fairly convinced it would be her who had the ticket. So I started to make some enquiries. I had a strong suspicion the girl would come out of the woodwork on the redemption deadline.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And he was absolutely right.)</span>
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
And yes, sure enough, she did. All I needed to do was to wait until the girl went to Windibank's to redeem the articles. But unfortunately, she redeemed only McGilded's overcoat and the one disk that was in its pocket. The all-important music box with the second disk inside was missing.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Because it had already been forfeited two days earlier.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
But I was unaware of that fact. Had I not been, I could have avoided my night-time excursion.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Meanwhile, as our investigation into the stolen government secrets was progressin'... ...we'd picked up on the fact that McGilded was involved.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Inspector! <span style="color:#0070C0">(You've recovered fast!)</span>
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
My orders were to recover the stolen information as quickly as possible. So we started gatherin' the fella's possessions and examinin' whatever we could lay our hands on. We had a full-scale investigation goin' on at the Yard, but we had to keep it as quiet as we could.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Then, when the inspector here took the disk from me in the pawnbrokery that day, I become <i>[sic]</i> nervous. I was sure the music box and the second disk were still there in the shop somewhere. So I knew that it was a race against time. I had to find those articles before the police did.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So that's what prompted you to break into the place that same night... ...with the help of your old friends, the Skulkin brothers.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
......... What happened that night in the pawnbrokery...I can only describe as a nightmare. While Nash and Ringo were searching the counter... ...I'd located the music box I'd sold to McGilded on the shelves of forfeited articles.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And <span style="color:#E16935">the second disk</span> was inside?
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes. I slipped it into my pocket with a very deep sigh of relief. But then something entirely unexpected happened.
</p>
<hr />
<center>'What are you doing in my shop?!'<br />
*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<p>Graydon:<br />
A gunshot rang out in the shop, and I felt a sharp pain in my left arm.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The broker fired his gun, and the bullet pierced your limb.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
Yes, exactly. But unfortunately... ...I'd decided to bring my own gun with me that night. Just in case.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<p>Graydon:<br />
Before I knew what was happening, I'd fired back. The man had already turned to flee. I hadn't intended to fire in his direction, much less kill him. But unfortunately for both of us...the bullet hit home. It struck him in the middle of his back as he fled through the storeroom door for refuge.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A sorry, sorry tale...
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
It all took place in the blink of an eye. I don't imagine Nash and Ringo even realised what had happened at first. I was terrified...so I fled. And that's the whole story. That's everything that happened at Windibank's on that wretched night.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........
</p>
<center>...........................</center>
<p><br />
Van Zieks:<br />
Earlier, you called McGilded a monster. A man who used his wealth and influence to distort the facts and escape justice for the crime of murder. What tragic irony... For what you have done...is exactly the same.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You've become the very monster you saw, and despised so deeply, in McGilded.
</p><p>Graydon:<br />
......... Yes...I think I have.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Well...this has been a long and exhausting trial. However, it would seem that at last we have arrived at the truth. Inspector Gregson...what of Mr Ashley Graydon?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
He's been restrained, My Lord, and is bein' escorted to the Yard. He'll be charged with the murder of Mr Windibank... ...and the stealin' of government secrets.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very good. And you, Inspector. Regrettably, you will have to face charges yourself.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
...Yes, My Lord. Of course.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It transpires that you were complicit in helping a criminal escape justice. That fact remains, whether or not you were doing so in the line of duty. ...The crime is a serious one, Inspector. And inexcusable.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now to the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Ah! ...Yeah?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It is time for the final adjudication. Is the jury ready, Mr Foreman?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Yessir! Garrideb Squadron standing by, sir! This is really it now... The last push! The final call! The finishing whistle! My men are ready to deliver their verdicts!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Mr Foreman. Very well, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will now declare your final decisions to the court!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Not guilty!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Not guilty!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Not guilty!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Not guilty!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Not guilty!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Not guilty!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Hahaha! That's the stuff! I'm off the 'ook!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Finally, Runo! You finally managed to do it!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Finally is the word. I really wasn't sure if we'd come out on top for a while there.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Susie was right. You're the best lawyer in the world!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Miss Lestrade. I am not finished with you yet.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh?! Wot, wot are ya lookin' at me like that for?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Before you start enjoying your freedom, there are certain other crimes to consider, hm?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Two months ago - in my courtroom, no less - you gave false testimony, did you not? And in relation to the trial today, not only did you unlawfully enter Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...you also attempted to abscond with Mr McGilded's property, it seems.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
EEEH?! I never done nuffin' o' the sort!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Of course not. It's not like you were gleefully wearing McGilded's coat in your cell yesterday or anything...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Aww... And just when I was getting excited about throwing a party for Ginny this evening...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And turning our attention to the defence... Determining that, when played together, the music box disks contained a message in Morse code was... Well, it was certainly a most unexpected revelation, Counsel.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Quite so, My Lord. The prosecution was caught entirely off guard. In fact, I think we should applaud my learned friend's courage here today. I propose a toast. To demanding that government secrets be <span style="color:#E16935">disseminated</span> before the entire courtroom!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! V-Very sorry about that. It was the only way that I could get Inspector Gregson to admit to what he'd done, so...
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>If, if I may say something on that point...</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Isn't that...?)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
It's, um, about the sounds produced by the music box before. I do wonder...if that was really Morse code at all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What...what are you saying, madam?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Oh, well, it's just that I'm really rather fanatical when it comes to Morse code, you see. So much so that the whole world seems to be covered in dots and dashes to me, in fact.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Goodness, madam. An unhealthy level of obsession, one feels.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
But I must say that in my opinion, the sounds produced by those two disks... ...were nothing more than that. A meaningless serious <i>[sic]</i> of <span style="color:#E16935">two different tones</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha... WHAAAAAAT?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Can, can that really be? It...wasn't Morse code after all?!)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My Lord! The defence would like to listen to the music box again!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Are you off your nut?! How many times do I have to tell you, those disks contain ministerial secrets, sunshine?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
This courtroom is not an appropriate forum to discuss the nature of the government communications. We know McGilded conspired to trade national secrets with our enemies. Secrets acquired from Mr Graydon. Now that the man has admitted to his crimes, we have no need to pursue the matter further.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh...but it's really going to bother me!)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Miss Lestrade...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Yeah...Me Lord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That which you have seen today here in this courtroom has been extremely disturbing.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Falsified evidence...intimidation...perjury... A grim catalogue of depravity.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
An appalling experience to befall any child.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Come on. It ain't nuffin' I dun't see most days in the back slums.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I beg your pardon?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
If yer weak, ye pay for it. That's just 'ow life goes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Gina...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... But look, I reckon I've worked somefin' out today. The world ain't fair, but if ya want it to change... ...you've gotta start at 'ome. You've gotta change 'ow you are yerself.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, that's a very laudable lesson, I would say. I eagerly look forward to the born-again Miss Lestrade never gracing my courtroom with her presence again.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now...with regard to the murder of Mr Pop Windibank, proprietor of a pawnbrokery business on Baker Street... ...I hereby declare the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade...
</p>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
That is all. Court is adjourned!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
On a personal note, I must say you've surprised me, my Far Eastern friend.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...oh!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Despite being a Nipponese, you saw through the pretence to the malice that festered within that Englishman. And at the same time, saw through the grime to the surprising heart of your English client. You have a curious talent for judging character, especially considering our very different cultures.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I don't think there's anything curious about it.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Whether we're from the Empire of Great Britain...or the Empire of Japan... ...we're all human beings. We're not so very different on the inside.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... You know, I took this case for one very simple reason. To lock swords with you once again here in the courtroom.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You did?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
When I encountered you for the first time two months ago, it reminded me... ...of toasting friendship and trust with another Nipponese...only to find my trust betrayed. Through you, I hoped to look into the eyes of the man I once knew...and try to understand.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... You mentioned something similar earlier today - about 'total betrayal' at the hands of the Japanese. What happened exactly?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Well you may ask. And one day, when the time comes, you will learn the answer, whether you like it or not.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Alright, then I'll wait for that day, if I must.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Coming to be known as the Reaper of the Bailey, and my retirement from service five years ago... It gives me cause to wonder...if our meeting has some deeper purpose... So...farewell, my Nipponese fellow. Until we meet again.

Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's done... It's over at last... ......... But... ...where's Iris disappeared to?)</span> Ah... Congratulations, Gina! ...I knew it all along. I knew that you were innocent.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Well...you did wot ya said, Mr Narra-'Oddo. Ya believed in me. Right up to the end. ...Yer as odd as yer name.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's odd about it? I told you I had faith in you, didn't I?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... No one ever 'as before, see. Kept a promise, I mean. Properly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's awful...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I've figured somefin' out today. All me life, growin' up in the slums, I've never trusted no one. But that's just cos I've been scared of bein' stabbed in the back. I mean, the more ya trust someone, the more it 'urts when they let ya down.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Yes...I think I can understand that. <span style="color:#0070C0">(After all, I had a taste of it in that trial two months ago. I chose to trust someone, and paid for it. That betrayal left a big scar...)</span> You know, though, Gina, I worked something out quite recently, too. Trusting in someone else is...really an exercise in learning to trust yourself. <span style="color:#0070C0">(And when your gut tells you it's the right thing to do, and your trust is rewarded... ...there's no better feeling in the world.)</span> I think I have you to thank for reminding me of that valuable lesson.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Oh...well...if ya say so. Don't make a fat lot o' sense to me, though.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm trying to say...that putting my faith in you, Gina, has been a real pleasure.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
For cryin' out loud, pack it in! ......... But I s'pose... ...I sort of feel the same way. I mean...sometimes trustin' someone else is...ya know... alright.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Thanks.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
'This is the way I see it, Ryunosuke... A defence lawyer is only as good as his faith in his client. And that comes down to how much faith he has...in himself.'
</p><p>.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
After this experience...I'm starting to feel like I understand what you mean. Kazuma... ...am I living up to your expectations? Am I turning out to be the lawyer you believed I could be?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p>
<hr />
<p>???:
</p>
<center>Pardon the interruption...</center><p> ...but what the deuce does a man have to do to be noticed around here...my dear fellow?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! Th-That voice!
</p><p>???:<br />
It's too late for 'th-that voice' now...Mr Naruhodo! I've been standing here patiently in the corner of the room for an eternity! 'Ah ha ha! Yes, it was me all along!' I would have said when finally you noticed me.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But you people! With your incessant babbling!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Aah! M-Mr Sholmes!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
'Ah ha ha! Yes, it was me all along!' ...You see?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'd, I'd assumed you'd been taken back to the hospital, to be honest.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed I was. ...But I managed to escape again!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I happen to be aware of one or two...foibles of the doctor who was tending to me. I merely made my knowledge of them known to the man, and he happily issued me with a leave of absence.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...How very above board.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But enough of my adventures. That was a fine victory, Mr Naruhodo. Your tireless efforts justly rewarded, I feel. Congratulations are in order! As a close friend, I tip my hat at you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...um... Thank you.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Hmph! Some great detective you are! Great at bein' cold as ice maybe!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...Have I irked you in some way, Miss Lestrade?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
While you've been 'avin' a snooze in yer nice soft bed, some of us 'ave been fightin' for our lives!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah well...<span style="color:#E16935">that bullet</span> did cause me to lose a substantial amount of blood, it's true. So I have indeed been feeling somewhat cold. Not perhaps as cold as ice, but... Well, have a feel.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Could you take your hands off my neck please, Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And...in some way, I suppose...congratulations are in order for you, too, Miss Lestrade.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Wot's that s'posed to mean? Why so 'alf-'earted?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, naturally it isn't my intention to alarm you, but... ...an acquittal in a trial with that particular prosecutor is perhaps a little...precarious.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well done, Mr Sholmes. Not alarming in the slightest.)</span>
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Oh... <span style="color:#E16935">The Reaper</span>, ya mean? Cos anyone who's found not guilty in a trial 'e was workin' on winds up dead anyway? Is that it?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The very point I was trying to make! As exemplified by the fate of Mr McGilded, in fact. Ah, but of course...I pay no attention to such irrational drivel myself.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Yeah, well...it don't bother me.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh really?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
'Course not. The way I see it, the Reaper's a bit like 'Im upstairs.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Him upstairs? You mean...like God?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Yeah, 'Im upstairs knows wot's wot, right? 'E knows wot people are like on the inside. 'E won't 'ave got the wrong end o' the stick. There are some coves like that bogtrotter, wot are rotten to the core. At the end o' the day, 'Im upstairs makes sure they get wot they deserve.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I...suppose that's one way of looking at it. Divine justice is one thing, though. The Reaper taking matters into his own hands and claiming lives is another.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Well, I ain't like the McGildeds o' this world. So I ain't scared. ...I got principles, see.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... A trait in you which is to be admired, Miss Lestrade.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Oi! Just give a rest, alright?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As I was saying, congratulations are in order. The news of your acquittal...was very welcome news to me indeed. Let me express my heartfelt congratulations...Gina.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Well, um...erm...
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>THERE you are! Hurley! How long have you been here?</center>
<p><br />
Iris:<br />
Honestly! I went to the main entrance especially to meet you there!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, Iris, my dear, I do apologise. But wait until I tell you what happened! This pair made utter fools of themselves!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What happened?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As you know, I have a penchant for disguise. I was hiding in this room dressed as a bailiff. But these dolts didn't notice my presence at all! Ah ha ha ha hah! They had no idea! Can you imagine, Iris? Would you credit it?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hm...I'm not sure, really.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I beg your pardon?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I'm sorry, Hurley, but you just don't have the weighty presence you seem to think you have. In fact, you really ought to be careful about that. It's going to land you in trouble one day.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...I'll be careful.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ouch.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Anyway, it's such a shame. I was so hoping to throw a party for Ginny tonight. But...you won't be able to come, will you?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Don't look like I'm gonna be goin' nowhere for a while. You 'eard the judge's patter. I got stuff to make amends for, apparently. All them 'offences'. Wot was it again? Breakin' an' enterin', takin' the bogtrotter's stuff wot was in lug, blah, blah, blah...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I think you'll find that basically, being <span style="color:#E16935">a pickpocket</span> is the main offence.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
But divin' ain't an offence! It's <span style="color:#E16935">a job</span>, innit?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't think so!)</span>
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Still, it 'as got me thinkin', all this. Maybe I should start lookin' for another line o' work. I mean, you didn't start off as a lawyer, did ya, 'Oddo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well no...but I was never a pickpocket.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Well anyway, I reckon I could make a change. I'm gonna do somefin' for all them lot like me from the slums! Somefin' that makes a difference for 'em!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's a wonderful idea, Ginny! And I'm sure you can do it!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...Heh heh heh...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What is it?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Nuffin'...
</p><p>???:<br />
Miss Gina Lestrade!
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
The prison carriage has arrived, ma'am. Come with me to the rear gate at once.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Right, well...looks like I'm off then.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. Goodbye, Gina. And good luck.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Um...erm...'Oddo...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! What, what was that for?!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I, um...I dunno... I mean... ...I dunno wot to say, so...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, indeed... ...perhaps the situation calls for a phrase hitherto missing from your vocabulary, Miss Lestrade.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
On occasions such as this... ...I would recommend a simple 'thank you'.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh yes! It's good advice, Ginny!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Right, I see. Well... ......... .................. Tha... Thanks...'Oddo. Thank you for everyfin' wot you've done! For believin' in me!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Not at all. In fact, that should be my line. ...Thank you, Gina.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, there she goes. I wonder if I'll ever see her again...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well well, quite the indomitable pickpurse...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, I nearly forgot! I bought a paper outside. It's a special edition, and this trial is all over the front page! 'Pickpocket's Innocence Proven!' ...Isn't it wonderful?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You should have shown it to Gina, Iris. She would have been thrilled.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh no! How silly of me... Ah, but anyway...would you like the good news or the bad news?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh, not again.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, what do you say, Runo? Hurley?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As usual, I think I'd rather get <span style="color:#E16935">the bad news</span> out of the way first.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Absolutely not! I have no intention of listening to anything but <span style="color:#E16935">good news</span>!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
And there you have it. ...How people answer that question says a lot about them, doesn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Let's not go there.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Alright then...maybe let's start with the good news this time. The rain hash finally stopped! It was a record level of rainfall, apparently.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, that is good news indeed. We can journey back in greater comfort.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright then...what's the bad news?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
The huge storm has left the seas very choppy. The Channel in particular is awful, so sailings out of Dover have been delayed by a day or more.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wait... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Dover?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's right! If we head to the station immediately... ...we may still make it in time to wave Susie off!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... But, but... ...there won't be a train, surely? We couldn't be that lucky.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Who do you think I am, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr...Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I rushed to Victoria station earlier and made arrangements for <span style="color:#E16935">a special express</span>! If we hurry now, we shall be there in time for dinner! And I know of a fine restaurant that serves the most delicious baked sole.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't... The great detective does it again!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed he does! I happen to be aware of a number of the rail transport director's foibles.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I merely made my knowledge of them known to the man, and he happily laid on the locomotive. Elementary!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Just an idea, but it might be wise to stop manipulating people that way...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What are we waiting for, then! To London Victoria!
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">18th April, 5:32 a.m.<br />
Port of Dover, Quayside</span></center>
<p><br />
Sholmes:<br />
That took somewhat longer than I had anticipated.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Susie's boat must be about to leave now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Susato... Where are you...? Over there! Look! <span style="color:#0070C0">(It looks like she's reading something.)</span>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/6/60/Hold_it_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426133548" class="image"><img alt="Hold it Ryunosuke" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="146" data-image-name="Hold it Ryunosuke.png" data-image-key="Hold_it_Ryunosuke.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/6/60/Hold_it_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426133548" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Susato! Wait! What are you doing?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr...Mr Naruhodo? What are you doing here?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We came as soon as we could after the trial. I mean... ...we heard that sailings were being delayed due to the bad weather, you see.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, I... I see... Then! Then tell me! How did Gina's trial go?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It...it went well. She was acquitted.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... That's wonderful. Really wonderful news.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The book you were about to throw into the sea... It was your <span style="color:#E16935">Encyclopaedia of British Law</span>, wasn't it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear... I was hoping you hadn't seen that. ......... I'm not worthy of practising law in any way now. So...I was saying my final farewell.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You were saying goodbye to law? <span style="color:#0070C0">(You? Susato-san?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Would I be correct in assuming... ...it's because of <span style="color:#E16935">the peephole</span>, Miss Susato?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... I deliberately altered the scene of a crime. And...then I tried to hide the fact. What I did is utterly unforgivable!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That reminds me... ...how did you even come to have this, Susie?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
On the evening of the incident... ...Mr Sholmes had invited Gina to dinner, if you remember.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh yes! We had a wonderful time!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, Gina gave us a little introductory lesson, didn't she? To the art of pickpocketing, I mean.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, that was so much fun! I stole Runo's armband!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, please don't do that again, Iris. That band's very important to me.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well if it's so important, you should pay more attention to it! You didn't notice for ages!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
On a whim, I thought it would be fun to see if I could take the Cat-Flapomat. So I put it up my sleeve.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Really?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And then I rather forgot about it...until I found myself in Mr Windibank's shop with it later that night.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I see...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And then...
</p>
<hr />
<p>*BANG!*
</p><p>Susato:
</p>
<center>AAAAAAAH!!! Mr Sholmes! Mr Shooolmes!!!</center>
<p><br />
Sholmes:
</p>
<center>Leave me, Mr Naruhodo!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Right!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Susato:<br />
After Mr Naruhodo had left the shop, I started to think... That door started to play on my mind.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The storeroom door, you mean?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. If Gina was anywhere in the shop, I realised it could only be behind that door. And at that moment, <span style="color:#E16935">the little device</span> that I had up my sleeve sprang to mind. I was so worried about Gina, I simply had to know.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...you used the Cat-Flapomat to make <span style="color:#E16935">the peephole</span> in the door.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
As captured in a photographic print of the shop... ...by one of Hurley's Red-Handed Recorders.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed, it was of <span style="color:#E16935">the first importance</span>, that point. Precisely <span style="color:#E16935">when the peephole was made</span>. That information would prove to be Mr Naruhodo's greatest weapon. Though naturally without proof, it would have amounted to nothing.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But when I looked through the hole in the door... ...the sight that met my eyes made my blood run cold. Thoughts started to run through my mind. I remembered that trial two months earlier.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The trial of Magnus McGilded.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I thought about how he had manipulated the evidence and arranged false testimony to secure his freedom. It made the British justice system feel very dark and sinister to me. And then a terrible thought occurred to me. What if... What if some wicked criminal was planning to do <span style="color:#E16935">the same thing</span> now?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Because from the appearance of the crime scene, it looked exactly as though Gina had shot Mr Windibank. Even though I was sure she would never have done such a thing...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...You were worried that the true culprit would try to frame her for the crime?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's right. But then I realised... It would be <span style="color:#E16935">very difficult</span> for anyone to give false testimony in this case.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, the crime appeared to have happened behind the door of a locked room. For someone to claim falsely to have witnessed it, there would have to be <span style="color:#E16935">a way to see beyond the door</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
For which <span style="color:#E16935">a peephole</span> would be the very thing!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Only the peephole I had made wasn't actually there until <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> the crime had been committed, of course. And the criminal would know that, so it wouldn't make any difference.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But the possibility of a rather ingenious <span style="color:#E16935">trap</span> was there, was it not?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A, <span style="color:#E16935">a trap</span>? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Is that why she did it?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So...is that why you kept it <span style="color:#E16935">a secret</span>, Susie? You never mentioned that you made the peephole to anyone. ...Not even to the police.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I know. And I knew at the time what I was doing was wrong. <span style="color:#E16935">A criminal offence</span>, even. That's why I decided to confide in Mr Sholmes. If Mr Naruhodo was completely backed into a corner, with no other possible means of escape... ...the truth about the peephole could save him! That was my plan.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She really does think of everything...)</span> But, but then... ...why didn't you just tell me everything before the trial began?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
My dear fellow, you're not thinking straight. If she had done that, it would have rendered you <span style="color:#E16935">complicit</span> in the whole escapade.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You could have been disbarred if you had been seen to have knowingly tampered with a crime scene. So Miss Susato decided to shoulder the burden of responsibility alone. For your sake...and Miss Lestrade's.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Susato...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... The truth is, when it happened...I did it because... ...I'd lost a little of my faith in the law.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I was worried that the right person wouldn't be convicted of the crime. But the moment I allowed myself to think that... ...is the moment I lost my right to call myself a judicial assistant. .........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... What you did...isn't comparable to what he did. Graydon is the one who lied in the witness stand, using that peephole as a way to implicate Gina!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And besides... ...if the peephole inconsistency hadn't existed... ...I'm not at all sure that she would have been acquitted in the end. Miss Susato, what you did...saved Gina's life!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Well, with your kind words, Mr Naruhodo...you've saved me, too, from my regrets.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, we must all be thankful that Miss Lestrade's freedom has been assured.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, exactly. Although some of the loose ends in that trial will continue to play on my mind, I'm sure.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But the revelation that the music box disk contained secret messages, Mr Naruhodo! What a triumph to work that out! I'm full of admiration!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well actually...that argument wasn't quite as compelling as I thought it was.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! It wasn't?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There was a communications officer among the jury members, you see. A telegraph operator. And she said that the majority of the sounds on the disk were just meaningless tones.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As one would expect. After all, we are talking about secret government communications. No doubt they were written in <span style="color:#E16935">cipher</span> to avoid being readily understood should they have been intercepted.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In cipher? I, I see... So then we could never have hoped to understand the message anyway.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Nonsense, my dear fellow! It's quite a zero pipe problem, I assure you!

Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(...What?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well...that can't be a real word, can it? How funny.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Wait! Iris, what did you just say?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh! Um...I just said, '<span style="color:#E16935">Asogi</span>'. Does...that word mean something to you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mean something? Asogi...was <span style="color:#E16935">the name of my best friend</span>!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But how?! How do you know that name, Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I wrote it down during the trial before. When <span style="color:#E16935">the message</span> was playing on the music box.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She transcribed it on the fly? She really is a genius!)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I thought the message probably wouldn't be written out in plain Morse code, so I tried various ways to interpret it. But whatever I tried, the words just didn't seem to make any sense. That is...in <span style="color:#E16935">English</span> at least.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It suddenly occurred to me, you see... There's more than one Morse code. Not just the English variety. <span style="color:#E16935">Various countries</span> around the world have altered and added to Morse code to use it in their own languages.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I don't believe it! Are you saying...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's right. I've only actually seen a chart of Japanese Morse code once before. But I think it's based on <span style="color:#E16935">the i-ro-ha</span> pangram, isn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And you mean to say that in Japanese Morse code, the message says '<span style="color:#E16935">Asogi</span>'?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, I think so. ...Sorry, but I don't remember all of the Japanese Morse code.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Iris, would you let me see that?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Susato! Do you know it? Do you know <span style="color:#E16935">Japanese Morse code</span>?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes! I spent some time studying it. Because I'm quite sure Morse code will become ever more important for international communications!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Then might I recommend, my dear madam, that you focus your efforts on <span style="color:#E16935">the English version</span>?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Be that as it may! Iris, show me <span style="color:#E16935">the message</span>, please!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Of course!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... .................. But, but what can this possibly mean...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Whatever is in that long sequence of supposedly meaningless dots and dashes... ...it's made the colour drain from Susato-san's face.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... There's no doubt that this message is written in <span style="color:#E16935">Japanese Morse code</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So the British Empire has been using <span style="color:#E16935">Japanese</span> for its secret communications?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I don't understand the reason why, but... ...the message appears to be a list of <span style="color:#E16935">four</span> people's names.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Four names?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The first...is '<span style="color:#E16935">K. Asogi</span>'.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Kazuma Asogi... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Why? Why was his name on that disk?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The second...is '<span style="color:#E16935">A. Shin</span>'.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Shin? I don't recognise that name.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The third...is '<span style="color:#E16935">T. Gureguson</span>'.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Guregu... <span style="color:#E16935">Gregson</span>?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, it would seem Tobias Gregson is the third man on the list.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And what's HIS name doing in a secret government communication as well?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And the last name... .........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's the matter, Miss Susato?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's...it's just so strange... So unexpected...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh! What is it, Susie! Don't keep us in suspense!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... The last name...is '<span style="color:#E16935">J. Wilson</span>'.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wilson?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
John H. Wilson? You mean...Daddy?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It says only 'J. Wilson', so I'm afraid I can't be sure. Then, after the four names, it reads - if I translate from Japanese - '<span style="color:#E16935">That is all four</span>...' And that's the end of the message. Or rather, the end of what you noted down, Iris.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I just can't believe it. Who would ever have thought... ...that those disks contained Japanese Morse code? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Not to mention a strange list of some disturbingly familiar names...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It would appear that this particular message... ...is a communication of some kind between Great Britain and the Empire of Japan.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So...Daddy could be in Japan then. Where Susie and Runo come from!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! Well...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hm, no... It's not very likely really, is it? I mean, there are thousands of people with the surname Wilson, and there must be lots of 'J's among them.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Professor John H. Wilson, visiting professor of medicine at the Imperial Yumei University... But we can't tell Iris about that now. We just can't.)</span> This is so strange. Somehow, in solving the case of Mr Windibank's murder today... ...I feel like I've rolled back a boulder at the mouth of a very <span style="color:#E16935">dark</span> cave...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... I do wonder... ...if perhaps it's a <span style="color:#E16935">dark</span> cave that we shouldn't go wandering inside.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

<center>*HOOOOOONK*</center>
<p><br />
Susato:<br />
Oh dear...the ship is going to set sail soon.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...it seems so.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'll sail on that steamship first to the Port of Dunkirk in France. Then I'll change onto a larger passenger vessel bound for Japan.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You're really going then, Susie...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
We wish you a safe passage, Miss Susato.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Thank you so much. I wish all of you the very best.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Susato! I, I had hoped to have you always at my side...to guide me and support me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Please...come back soon. As far as I'm concerned...you really are the very best judicial assistant in the world!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...! ......... I'm...I'm quite sure... I'll be back before you know it!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Really, Susie?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, now don't forget, Iris, I made you <span style="color:#E16935">a promise</span> I've yet to fulfil.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">A promise</span>...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
About your <span style="color:#E16935">manuscript</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh yes... '<span style="color:#E16935">The Hound of the Baskervilles</span>'...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
......... Well I'll be waiting for you then, Susie! A promise is a promise!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Definitely, Iris! ......... Mr Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Do you remember the first time we met?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, of course. On the SS Burya, when I was dragged out from that wardrobe, still half asleep. If I remember rightly, you threw me halfway across the cabin with a Susato Takedown.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You know very well that I'm talking about <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> that! It's strange, but being thrown together as we were in that case, I somehow felt straight away... ...that you were the perfect person to continue Kazuma-sama's great legacy.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Susato...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And my instincts were right! I really want to believe... No... I'm sure that... ...I'll be back soon. Farewell until then!

Ryunosuke:<br />
Somehow we seem to have come to the end of the Adventures of Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Or the first volume, at least. Looking back now, it feels as though fate has led me on this journey. Fate led me to becoming a lawyer. To travelling halfway around the world. To meeting the great detective. I'm sure there'll be trials and tribulations ahead. Of course there will. But whatever happens I know I'll be able to turn my fortunes around. After all, I have the greatest friends in the world on my side.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, yes. Mr Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I have some rather...awkward news. The railway company has decided to sue over the special express train, apparently.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It caused such a commotion on the line. All the other trains had to wait at stations.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But really, we would never have made it to Dover in time otherwise. Anyway, I explained everything, and how it was all your fault.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh? Huh?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I believe a formal complaint should be delivered to your office tomorrow. But not to worry, my dear fellow. According to Miss Susato...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...You love defending yourself in court!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh? Huh? Huh?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It's alright, I'm perfectly happy to testify! 'He really didn't look like the sort of man who'd do something so outrageous.' ...See?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Um...Mr Sholmes...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A word, if you don't mind...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Why certainly! Any word you like. Bellow it out, my dear fellow!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh yes! I love Runo's 'words'. And I know just the one he'll use here!
