District Court<br />Defendant Lobby No. 1</span></center>
<p><br />
Pearl:<br />
Good morning! ...Oh? Are you by yourself?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ah... Morning, Pearls.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
M-Mr. Nick! Please tell me! What's going to happen to Mystic Maya?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I'm sorry... We don't know yet. The investigation is still going on, so I wasn't allowed into the Inner Temple.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Oh, I see... So is Sister Iris still trying to remove those trick locks in the Training Hall?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
No... She's the defendant in this case, so she can't be at the Inner Temple. She's required to be here in court.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Um... Then... How come she's not here in the defendant's lobby?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I have to admit it's kinda strange...)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
...If you're looking for Iris, she's in the prosecutor's lobby.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Ed-Edgeworth. What's Iris doing over there?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
She's going over today's testimony with the prosecutor as we speak.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Today's testimony...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You heard me... Iris is going to be testifying as a witness for the <span style="color:#E16935">prosecution</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Wait, what!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The prosecutor is squeezing her for a <span style="color:#E16935">confession</span>. ...Or so I heard.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Franziska von Karma... What are you up to...?)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I know what you're thinking, but Franziska isn't going to be the prosecutor today.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What...!? 
Then who is?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Who else would it be but Godot?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
G-Godot...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Franziska is engaged in some important work at the Sacred Cavern.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
The Sacred Cavern...? You don't mean that she's...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Exactly. She has been out there all night, trying to remove those trick locks. With the head nun's assistance, naturally. We estimate that the last of the locks should be taken care of in about three hours. I hope everything continues to go smoothly and we receive some good news soon.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yeah... Thanks, Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Prosecutor Godot intends to nail this case shut today. Be prepared to fight like there's no tomorrow!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...You don't have to tell me that.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I know. I can already see it in your eyes. You're not the same fever-ridden, frantic maniac you were yesterday.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It's strange... On the way here, I decided that today would be the end of all this. Almost immediately after I made that decision, I felt myself getting stronger.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Interesting... Maybe you've passed your cold onto someone else, literally. And with that... I leave the rest in your capable hands... partner.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Thanks...

District Court<br />Courtroom No. 7</span></center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
Court is now in session for the trial of Iris of Hazakura Temple.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
... Umm... Your Honor...? Wh-What are you...?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Who? Me? Well, my little brother came to visit me in my chambers earlier this morning. All of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, he developed a scorching fever and fainted! Therefore, I'll be standing in for him.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I-I see, Your Honor... <span style="color:#0070C0">(So they're brothers! That explains a lot...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
My poor brother. He looked a bit pale, not to mention sad that he couldn't be here.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
It is impossible to predict what the future has in store for any of us. This is precisely why people feel the need to judge the past. And we of the court have been charged with the solemn duty of passing such judgment.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Well said, Mr. Godot. I understood exactly what you said... at least up until the end, anyway. Now then, Mr. Godot. Please proceed with your opening statement.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...Humans are fragile, fickle beings. Our hearts change with the shifting of the tides. There is only one thing that remains a constant in this crazy world... The bitter darkness that lies at the bottom of this mug.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So then you mean...? Um... Forget it. What do you mean?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
During yesterday's trial, the accused refused to admit her role in the crime. But today, she has had a change of heart... Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple has a <span style="color:#E16935">confession</span> to make.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
C-Confession...! Th-The defendant...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Iris... Why didn't she discuss this with me first...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. This court will now hear the defendant's confession!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Godot:<br />
...Upon meeting a beautiful lady, always ask for her name and profession. That's one of my rules.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...Um, my name is Iris. I am but a simple nun undergoing training at Hazakura Temple.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Witness, is there something that you want to confess to?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...Yes. But first, I want to apologize to Mr. Wright... I... I can't continue lying to everyone anymore.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I-It's alright... What is it...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Mr. Wright, I have to admit that I... I did play a part in this terrible incident.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Are... Are you actually <span style="color:#E16935">confessing</span>!? Are you saying that you were the one who murdered Ms. Elise Deauxnim?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...No, I'm not, Your Honor. But I dealt with the <span style="color:#E16935">cover up</span>, after the murder took place. After her spirit left, I took the lifeless shell of Mystic Elise... ...and carried it to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard where I desecrated it.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh... Whaaaat!? O-Order in the court! Order! W-Witness...! Are you... Are you saying you were an <span style="color:#E16935">accomplice</span> to the murder!?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
... Yes. That's correct.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Whaaaaaaat!? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Three minutes in court and I'm already covered in a cold sweat...)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Ha...! Everyone on the planet is an accomplice to something. It just happens to be that in this case, it's to murder. Isn't that right... Mr. Trite?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Grrr, that Godot... So this is the <span style="color:#E16935">confession</span> they were conferring about! It pains me to say this... ...but it looks like Iris's testimony was all a lie.)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Iris's Testimony crumpled up and shoved into a pocket.</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Now then, little lady. If you don't mind, I've got a question for you. Whose crime were you trying to cover up by your actions?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Iris was <span style="color:#E16935">covering</span> for someone...? Nngh... Now I'm definitely up the creek without a paddle... or a lifejacket.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...I've been at Hazakura Temple ever since I was a little girl. Hazakura Temple is run by one of the branch families of the Kurain Tradition. One of our missions is to protect the main family.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I'm sorry, but "main family"...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, and that's why I would dirty myself, if need be, to protect her... The daughter of the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Maya Fey!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Wake up and smell the coffee, Trite.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Sh-She's naming... MAYAAAAAAAAA!?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order in the court! So not only did you witness the murder... You know the name of the murderer!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I'm terribly sorry... But it's true. I saw her commit the crime with my very own eyes... And then I cleaned up the area to try to protect her.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Judge:<br />
The defense will refrain from commenting until the appropriate time. Now, witness. Let's hear your testimony. What exactly happened on the night of the crime?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
... ...Yes, Your Honor.

<p>Iris:<br />
I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.<br />
I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!<br />
While Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike!<br />
Mystic Maya tried desperately to defend herself and stole the weapon...!<br />
It was only in self-defense! You can't blame her for it!<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
So it was in <span style="color:#E16935">self-defense</span>?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes. Mystic Elise was the one who attacked first!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's why I tried my best to protect Mystic Maya!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
You moved the victim's body to the temple so that Maya wouldn't be suspected... Isn't that right? Not bad... You've got the instincts of a true criminal.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Something's not quite right. I'm sure it was established yesterday... ...that Iris <span style="color:#E16935">never went to the Inner Temple</span> that night.

Did she now? Too bad for you, what she said yesterday doesn't mean much today. By the way, where were you when she claimed that she didn't go?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Umm, I... It was in the Inner Temple's Training Hall...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
A private conversation between the two of you does not constitute testimony. That would be properly described as hearsay.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... What do you have to say, witness?

I-I just couldn't tell him the truth at that time. Mystic Maya... She's your girlfriend, isn't she?

Mystic Elise was trying to kill Mystic Maya. I think that's why she wanted a more lethal weapon.

It's true... It's not easy to inflict a deadly blow with a staff.

Sister Iris, let me make sure I've got this straight. The victim herself chose to throw away her staff?

Sister Iris... There's something strange about your version of events.

Huh...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ms. Deauxnim throwing her staff away makes no sense at all to me.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
B-But all you can do with a staff is hit someone...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Naturally you wouldn't know this, Sister Iris, but... ...the victim's staff had a special feature about it. As you can see, it's a <span style="color:#E16935">sword</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
If Elise Deauxnim really had wanted to kill Maya Fey... ...she wouldn't have needed to use a separate dagger! Not when she already had a beautiful blade in her hands already! ...Well, Sister Iris? What do you have to say?

Uhh, err, I...

...That was an impressive bit of investigating, Trite. I never would have thought there was a sword hidden in that staff. But even so... How should I put this?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
A long sword is unwieldy, and thus quite ineffective in close-quarters combat. Maybe that's why she chose a dagger over her blade.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Um, well...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Anyway, the type of weapon she chose to use isn't what's important. The important thing is that she <span style="color:#E16935">tried to kill Maya Fey</span>. As long as there's nothing strange about that, there's no problem with her testimony.

</p><p>Judge:<br />
One, that the victim supposedly threw away a sword during a fight... ...and two, that the two people battling to the death were mother and daughter... Despite the facts being believable when taken on their own... ...when taken together, the entire story seems difficult to believe.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...Listen. There's nothing in this world that is impossible. Except for one little thing.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes? What is this one little impossible thing...?

Ha...! You still don't get it. You think maybe my beans are under-roasted, but you have no idea gramps.

I heard this witness's confession this morning... ...just as I had taken the first sip of my eighth cup of morning coffee.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...You're going to ruin your health, my friend.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Anyway, after hearing this woman's confession... I had a detective who loves to investigate sent to the scene of the crime. And... he discovered this little beauty.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Is that the <span style="color:#E16935">dagger</span> the witness testified to seeing...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Obviously, Your Honor... But do you not notice something else?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Now that you mention it, if you look closely, there appears to be a <span style="color:#E16935">bloodstain</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Wh-Where did you find that? I didn't see that when I investigated the crime scene!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...Did you investigate the pine tree at the crime scene?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh? The pine tree...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
This dagger was stuck in the back side of the pine tree. When the last blow was struck, ending the violent battle between the two women... ...this little baby was thrown in the direction of the back of the pine tree.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Which means... the blood on this dagger belongs to the <span style="color:#E16935">victim</span>, correct!?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Ha...! Were you even listening, old man? I first heard this confession this morning. Just as I had taken the first sip of my 13th cup of morning coffee.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Didn't you say it was your 8th just a few minutes ago!?)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
I didn't have enough time to get the blood analyzed on such short notice.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In any case, the court will accept the dagger as evidence. Furthermore, I order that a blood test be performed on it immediately!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
This is my sweetheart. Make sure you treat her right.

...Bailiff! Get this piece of evidence to the crime lab for testing immediately!

Cute girls never lie. Ever.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In any case, witness... If you could please testify again to this court.

I-I'm not sure. The area was very dark, so... I really couldn't see. I think it got knocked away somewhere as the fight escalated.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That makes sense... That would explain the need for the dagger.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Mystic Elise raised the dagger to strike. But Mystic Maya dodged it at the last second. The dagger struck the lantern and fell to the ground. And then at some point, Mystic Maya picked it up...!

<p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It seems like a reasonable story at first... But... there's one thing that is completely impossible. The very idea of Maya stabbing someone... That alone is impossible! Which means... ...this faulty testimony must contain another <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span> in it somewhere.)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
...Something about you just isn't right today, Iris!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Huh...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Until now, I didn't think you were the type to make such a careless mistake. However! The testimony you just gave contains quite a few contradictions.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Wh-What do you mean? What's so wrong about my testimony?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
According to you... ...Maya Fey stabbed the victim, who had her back to the stone lantern... Correct?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Y-Yes... That's right.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But in that case, the victim would've been stabbed in the <span style="color:#E16935">stomach</span>, right?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Y-Yes, I think so...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But! According to the autopsy report... ...the cause of death was due to blood loss from a stab wound in her <span style="color:#E16935">back</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
This proves that the victim was stabbed <span style="color:#E16935">from behind</span>, not from the front! Sister Iris! It appears another seed of doubt has sprouted from your testimony!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Aaaaaaaah!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What...!? What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Ha...! It's simple. People are like books. We've all got a front and a back. You get my drift?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
... Umm, is that all you have to say?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
I can also say that darkness loves to play with the human mind.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Could you please knock it off with the cheesy proverbs and illogical metaphors already!? The point is, too much of this testimony just doesn't make sense! Throwing away a useful staff, the people fighting being mother and daughter... And now, she falsely claims the victim was stabbed in the stomach!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... There certainly are some inconsistencies.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well, Iris... How about it!?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
... W-Well, it's just...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
If you ask me, you're just being too naïve about the whole thing.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What do you mean...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
There are 253 distinct types of bitterness in coffee... But to pick out each one requires total concentration and the use of all the senses. Were you really concentrating on what this witness actually said?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Prosecutor Godot! Explain yourself!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
The witness was quite unambigious <i>[sic]</i> about her own ambiguities when she said... ...that the garden was dark and she <span style="color:#E16935">couldn't see clearly</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
A human needs one thing to see clearly. And that is... light.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Light...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
By the way, did you know? The Inner Temple has a rule that on nights when an acolyte is there training... ...the <span style="color:#E16935">stone lantern</span> in the garden is to always be lit.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm... I did wonder what that stone lantern was there for...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well if that's true... ...shouldn't the witness have been able to see the crime more clearly?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...Normally yes, Your Honor. But according to the head nun, Sister Bikini... ...on the night of the crime, it was impossible to light that stone lantern.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Impossible</span>...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
It hadn't been used in a long time and the wick was no good. In other words... It had to be nearly <span style="color:#E16935">pitch black</span> in the garden that night. There could have been a faint light coming from the Training Hall, but that's all.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Most enlightening...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Yes, that illuminating fact has chased all the contradictions away! ...If the staff was dropped, it would be difficult to see. It also explains why they didn't recognize each other. We can't see the demons that lurk in the night... That's why humans are weak. Isn't that right, Trite?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
N-- Nooooooooooooooo!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! Ordeeer!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Here, Your Honor. Let me present the stone lantern into evidence. Maybe it will rekindle the flame of truth in your mind.

Wh-What the...!?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh yes... That's right... After being cornered and then stabbed by Mystic Maya... Mystic Elise didn't fall down right away. She must have been writing that on the stone lantern behind her... ...with the <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span> that was draining out of her body!

After Mystic Elise died... I called out to Mystic Maya.<br />
I thought it was my duty to protect the future Master of the Kurain Tradition.<br />
So I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself...<br />
I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.<br />
Then I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple and...<br />
...I used the Shichishito to alter the way the wound looked.<br />
</p>

...So you moved the body.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes... I was raised at Hazakura Temple... I owe a great deal of thanks to the Fey clan. But even so... I never imagined... ...that Elise Deauxnim was actually Misty Fey! I've... I've committed a terrible sin!

Why did you do that?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Because I didn't want Mystic Maya to be suspected in any way. I thought the best thing would be to remove the body from the crime scene...

You moved her body all by yourself...?

It's pretty amazing you could make it all the way across... That's a rickety old bridge.

...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It would have been much easier than dragging it all the way to Hazakura Temple.

I thought that it would still cast too much suspicion on Mystic Maya... That's why I tried to take the body as far away as possible...

It looks like the defense is not prepared to offer a suitable explanation...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
You see what I mean? In other words... You're in no position to suggest that this lady's testimony isn't the truth!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Aaaaaack!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Alright then. Witness, let's hear your testimony once more.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
About what, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You've admitted that you moved the victim's body. Nevertheless, your prior testimony contained a rather large inconsistency. ...Please add an explanation for that to your testimony.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, Your Honor.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

<p>Iris:<br />
Other than walking over the bridge, there's no way to move the body.<br />
So I... must have just... gotten confused, I guess.<br />
Was the snow still falling or had it stopped...? Does it really matter that much?<br />
Or are you saying that there is a way to cross a burning bridge?<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... So it was just a misunderstanding, I see.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
This is a photo of Dusky Bridge after it burned down from the lightning blast. It was taken on the morning after the incident.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It certainly was burned to a crisp... And one of the suspension wires is gone... It's amazing the whole bridge didn't fall. Clearly it would be impossible to carry a corpse across a bridge in this condition.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Dusky Bridge Photo added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Unless I do something to discredit this testimony... ...it's going to be deemed as the  <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>... ...and Maya will be  <span style="color:#E16935">accused of murder</span>!)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Trite. I'm only going to say it one more time.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Godot:<br />
It is only human to err. And... ...only humans can spot the errors of our ways.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The more sense he makes, the less sense he makes...)</span>

You see? It's not that easy to remember, is it?

</p><p>Iris:<br />
Or perhaps he just <span style="color:#E16935">drew it wrong</span>!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Either way, it sounds like you're... <span style="color:#E16935">just wrong</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...With someone like Laurice, I admit a mistake is a definite possibility. But then that begs the question... "Why did he make a mistake?" What was the <span style="color:#E16935">reason</span>?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...Are you saying you know the answer to that?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Listen! Think back, alright? Remember what Laurice was doing when he witnessed this event. ...He was at Heavenly Hall waiting for a lover that was never going to come. He waited and waited, and finally he laid down. ...But then! Lightning shoots from the sky and sets the bridge aflame! Now ponder what sort of position Larry must have been in at the time... He was <span style="color:#E16935">lying on his back</span>, which is why he remembered the scene the way he did.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
... He was lying on his back...? I can't see how it relates...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But it does, Your Honor. That is the reason why the wires in the sketch <span style="color:#E16935">go up instead of down</span>...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Aaaaaah!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Ugh... No way...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Laurice Deauxnim witnessed the event while he was <span style="color:#E16935">lying on his back</span>, face up. In other words, the scene that he saw... ...was actually <span style="color:#E16935">upside-down</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So then...! This sketch should actually...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I think you finally get it, Your Honor. The correct way to view Laurice Deauxnim's sketch is like this! This is how it should actually look! The victim's body wasn't <span style="color:#E16935">flying above</span> the bridge! It was actually <span style="color:#E16935">swinging below</span>! ...That's right! Just like a <span style="color:#E16935">pendulum</span>!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Bwwweeeediculous!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! Order--

Of all the things to say! A pendulum!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...The bridge was burning to a crisp. There was no way to get across it. But if the body had been found at the Inner Temple, it would have caused problems. This is where the criminal decided to take a gamble. They used the burning bridge to get the body across to the other side. And a pendulum was the only way to get it done!

</p><p>Godot:<br />
...Let's think about this for a minute, shall we? Dusky Bridge is about 20 yards long. Which means it's about that far from the Inner Temple to the opposite cliff.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Yes, that sounds right.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
In order to cover that distance with a pendulum... You'd need a rope at least <span style="color:#E16935">10 yards</span> long. To get a rope that long, you have to plan ahead!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

Aaaaaaaah! This... This is one of the <span style="color:#E16935">wires</span> from the bridge!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
When the lightning struck the bridge and set it on fire... ...one of the suspension wires came loose from its anchor. The criminal didn't have any time to waste. So they tied the wire around Elise Deauxnim's body... ...because there was simply no other way to move the body!

Mr. Godot!? Hmm... It seems that Mr. Godot is more focused on his coffee than answering my question. It seems that the odds of a rope being readily available were very high. So I suppose that it's not an impossibility after all!

<p>Phoenix:<br />
Before I present my evidence, let me review what we know so far. According to this photo, one of the wires snapped. Looking at the map, we can see it's the one that was in front of the Inner Temple.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So then, that was the spot where the criminal...!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes, precisely. Now let us consider the body's movement by looking at the overhead map again. If the body was pushed from this point here... ...it would <span style="color:#E16935">drop</span> on the opposite bank at approximately this point.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
D-Did you say <span style="color:#E16935">drop</span>?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well, they must have failed to catch the body on the other bank.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What...!? What makes you think something like that happened!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Because I have evidence that suggests her body <span style="color:#E16935">dropped</span> some distance.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Wh-What kind of evidence!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Take a look at this autopsy report. It says here that her body fell about 10 feet after her death.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ten feet, huh...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's most likely the height difference between the two sides. The body over swung due to forward momentum but then came loose and fell about 10 feet. And then, as a result of the landing impact... ...this crystal sphere was knocked loose!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...! That's...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes, this blood-stained amethyst crystal... It's the one that came off of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff! And even more important is the <span style="color:#E16935">place</span> where this crystal sphere was found!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In-Indeed... I believe it's already marked on this overhead map. The crystal was found... Aaaaaah!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Precisely, Your Honor. In the very spot where <span style="color:#E16935">the pendulum would arrive</span> if given the right amount of speed!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
This explains your theory quite well, Mr. Wright. You have provided us with a way the body could have been moved that night... An impressive deduction, Mr. Wright. ...Most impressive. M-Mr. Wright!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
I thought this cold coffee might help cool you down.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh... What is the meaning of this, Mr. Godot!?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
That was a dark and bitter guess that you made, Trite. ...But you forgot about one thing.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh? And what would that be?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
... The aroma.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Huh?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
A coffee's most reliable accomplice is its deep and profound aroma...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Um... The rest of the court doesn't speak Coffeenese. Can you elaborate a bit more?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
If the criminal had sent the body to the other side like you say... ...then naturally, there must have been an accomplice laying in wait to catch it.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
An accomplice...!?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...The criminal wasn't able to cross Dusky Bridge. So, who collected the body...? What do you have to say about that, Trite!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mr. Godot is correct... This can't be the work of a single person! Well, Mr. Wright!? You know what you must do.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Yes, Your Honor. <span style="color:#0070C0">(The body couldn't have made it to Hazakura Temple without an accomplice!)</span>

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hawthorne...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Sister Iris had a twin sister. ...And you're looking at her. Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...... That name rings some bells. Distant bells, but bells nonetheless...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Ha...! It's just your imagination, gramps. This file contains all the relevant data about Dahlia Hawthorne.

<p>Dahlia:<br />
My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.

No... The honor is all mine.

... So what? Death has no meaning in this courtroom!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...You of all people should already understand. After all... The blood of the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique flows within that body.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The Kurain Channeling Technique...? Now where have I heard that...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...That's right. You're not Dahlia Hawthorne herself. You're the <span style="color:#E16935">spirit</span> of Dahlia, currently inhabiting the body of a spirit medium!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
What an exciting story. Exciting, but quite impossible. You're asking us to buy that Dahlia Hawthorne just happened to be channeled by someone... ...on the very night of the murder, to a temple where her twin sister, Iris was...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well, if you're going to put things that way, then... Yes.
</p><p>Godot:<br />

</p><p>Godot:<br />
We're supposed to believe a coincidence like that just happens!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Naturally it was no coincidence. The whole thing was part of a plan from the very beginning. It's all written right here in these instructions...!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah...! Wh-What's that...!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
These instructions were written by your mother, Morgan Fey! And part of the plan called for Dahlia Hawthorne to be channeled! That night... ...there were two Irises at Hazakura Temple.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...T-Two of them?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Even the time of the channeling was planned out. "As soon as you hear the lights out bell"... In other words, <span style="color:#E16935">10:00 PM</span>. However, Iris was seen before dinnertime.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That means the Iris that was at dinner was the real Iris.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And the Iris who gave me this hood in the Main Hall was also the real Iris. Meaning that the Iris Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple... ...was someone else dressed as her! Namely, one <span style="color:#E16935">Dahlia Hawthorne</span>!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Do you even know what you're saying, Trite? This whole "channeling the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne" business... Yes, it's true that you found plans that talk about it. ...However! There's one thing that's perfectly clear. The witness currently standing in the witness stand is the <span style="color:#E16935">real</span> Iris!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Whaaaaat!?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Calm down and remember what you know about the night of the crime. After meeting Sister Bikini, the Dahlia Hawthorne that had been channeled... ...would've been stranded at the Inner Temple due to the lightning strike. It was later that the body was moved by pendulum.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...That's right.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Naturally that would mean that the Iris that received the body was... ...the <span style="color:#E16935">real</span> Iris. Are you with me so far?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Yes.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
After being notified of what happened, the police came to Hazakura Temple's Main Hall. There they found Iris in her room and arrested her. And ever since, she's been under police supervision at the detention center.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-Yes, I suppose... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I can't deny any of that...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Whew... Thank goodness. It looks like he's finally convinced...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(But something still seems off... Way off...!)</span> I'm still not convinced that the Iris here is the same one from the other night.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Ha...! I suppose you're about to say something really ridiculous? Like, the real Iris and the spirit of Dahlia... ...somehow <span style="color:#E16935">switched places</span>?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
S-Switched places...!? To be perfectly honest... ...there are still quite a few things I don't understand, but I do know... ...that unless we confirm the witness's identity, we can't continue with this trial.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Iris doesn't have the spiritual power needed to channel Dahlia. Which means... ...they must have <span style="color:#E16935">switched places</span> somewhere.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, Mr. Wright? Since the time she was arrested at Hazakura Temple... ...have there been any chances for Iris to switch places with Dahlia Hawthorne?

Last year, she was transferred to the same detention center as me. Since I was on death row and she was my mother... ...it was actually pretty easy to meet with her.

All to make Pearl Fey the Master of Kurain...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
She's a cold, twisted woman. She thought she could finally regain her lost honor. The honor she lost when her younger sister, Misty, took her place as the Master. Ever since that day, she's been working on this plan.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You're talking about Pearl Fey, is that correct?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Yes, though at first she had high hopes for the two of us.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
You and your twin sister, Iris?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
That's correct. Fortunately, neither of us had much spiritual power. That's why... we were abandoned by her... along with our father.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A-Abandoned...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
The only person I ever really cared about in life was myself... My sister was a nuisance, so I convinced my father to leave her at an old temple.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You mean Iris...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...Yes, my father remarried a woman who also had a daughter. The less children you have, the more money there is to go around, right? And on top of that, my father had absolutely no interest in children in general.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
H... How horrible...
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
The real horrible one was that woman... That bitter, vengeful woman. It was her stubbornness that gave birth to that child... Pearl Fey. She was born with an abundance of spiritual power. ...Unfortunately for her. Morgan Fey heaped all of her broken hopes and dreams on to that poor child's back. All because of her pathetic dreams of having her bloodline become the main family.

</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...How sad. You still don't get it, do you? What Pearl wanted had nothing to do with it. Morgan didn't care one bit about Pearl. The only thing she cared about was the position of the Master. That's all.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Th-That's ridiculous...!
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
She was willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to achieve her goal. The life of her daughter... and naturally, the life of Maya Fey as well.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-You...? You were going to kill Maya?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Pearl didn't need to know anything about it... All she had to do was to follow the instructions in the letter and channel me. Then I would have simply used her body and finished the job. In any case... I'm already dead, and there's nothing any of you can do to me...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Grrrr...!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
So the plan was to blame the crime on your younger sister. On Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple...
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
She and I look absolutely identical. No one can tell us apart. If someone were to witness me killing Maya... ...naturally they would think it was Iris that had done it.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
And the witness in this case was the head nun, Sister Bikini.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
I never would've guessed she was going to return to Hazakura Temple that night. But... she wound up seeing Iris's "crime" anyway.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But why did you want to pin the murder on Iris in the first place!? She's your twin sister, isn't she?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Twin sister...!? Don't make me laugh! She's nothing but a backstabber. I couldn't care less about her.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Backstabber...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
You just don't understand. ...You never will. Anyway...

<span style="color:#0070C0">(I somehow knew this was it...)</span>

...I wanted to send her a message. It was at her hands that I suffered my first humiliation... I wanted her to feel the same pain she made me feel! Sadly... when I realized revenge was impossible, I gave up.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
And the reason it was impossible...? Was it perhaps because Mia Fey <span style="color:#E16935">had already died</span>...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Yes. And I realized... there's only one way to take revenge against the dead.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A-And how do you do that?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Even when the body dies, the spirit, the <span style="color:#E16935">ego</span>, it lives on... forever. I wanted to take away the person that Mia Fey loved most. I wanted to kill her with my own hands! That would be the one and only way I could take my <span style="color:#E16935">revenge</span> against Mia Fey! That was the reason I helped out with that woman's plans!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Just for that!? For that you would kill Maya!? Your goal was no different than that of Morgan Fey!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
... As they say, "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree." What a cruel plan... Cruel, cold, and heartless.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...Hmph! Don't waste your time preaching to the dead. I've already told you, there's not a thing you can do to me.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Grrrr...!
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
That night... ...at about 9:30 PM, I materialized into this world. I quickly pinned my hair up and put on a demon-warding hood. Then I picked up the staff that was by my side and left Hazakura Temple.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So... it was <span style="color:#E16935">Elise Deauxnim</span> who channeled her after all.)</span>

</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that.

That's not like her at all! Maya wouldn't stab a French fry with a plastic fork!
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Anyway, I suddenly lost consciousness... But before I did... I scrawled her name on the lantern. Just as I was passing out, I wrote "<span style="color:#E16935">Maya</span>" behind my back. I had hoped it would cast suspicion on her.

It-It <span style="color:#E16935">stops</span>...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
I don't have any memory of <span style="color:#E16935">actually killing Maya Fey with my own two hands</span>. My very last memory was... ...Maya's terror-filled eyes. When I woke up after that... ...I was in the <span style="color:#E16935">Sacred Cavern</span> surrounded by darkness.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You were in the Sacred Cavern?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...The entrance was sealed with one of those trick locks. Somehow I had been trapped in there.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
But how did you wind up in there?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...I'd like to know that myself. Anyway, I was worried... I didn't know whether or not Maya Fey was dead... And I swore I wouldn't return to the underworld until I knew I had killed her myself.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Hmm... For a ghost, you're one tough cookie...
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
I wanted to get out of there and make sure she was dead. But... I couldn't do it. I couldn't get out.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
The trick lock stopped you, huh?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
I didn't know how to remove it.

So then you're saying... ...you were actually <span style="color:#E16935">confined against your will</span> inside this Sacred Cavern...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Yes! I wanted to get rid of that annoying lock as soon as possible... But it wasn't easy. I kept getting interrupted while I was working on it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Interrupted...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
It was early in the morning, but someone came into the Training Hall.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What!? Who!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Could it have been... Maya!?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
I thought the same thing. But I couldn't see.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Why not!?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
If someone had spotted me, I would have lost my chance to take revenge. ...So I made sure to hide myself well at the back of the Sacred Cavern.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That morning... only <span style="color:#E16935">two people</span> could have gone into the Training Hall. Maya and... Pearls... Pearls went there to cover the hanging scroll in gravy.)</span>
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Still, I finally managed to remove the lock. But... I was too late.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...The flies had already started to gather.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
The bridge had been fixed and the police had started their investigation, correct?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Naturally, I couldn't go out. So instead... I returned to the cavern and put the lock back on myself. I realized I wouldn't get a chance to see Maya's corpse as I had hoped... But just then... Lady Luck showed up.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Lady Luck</span>...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
After that big earthquake... she showed up, all by herself.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...The <span style="color:#E16935">real</span> Iris?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
She said she'd come to make sure the Sacred Cavern was alright... Stupid girl. I came out from the Sacred Cavern and got a feel for the situation. ...And I locked her away in my place. I had finally learned exactly what had happened... It was then that I learned that the plan had actually succeeded.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What do you mean your plan had <span style="color:#E16935">succeeded</span>?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
I had misunderstood one thing, you see. That night, the one that had summoned me... I had assumed that it was Pearl Fey.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
W-Well of course you would've assumed that. It was written in the instructions.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
But... I was wrong. The person that had actually called my spirit back was... <span style="color:#E16935">Misty Fey</span>... The picture book author...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh... Whaaaaaaat!?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Well, that's really the only possibility, isn't it? After I lost consciousness in the garden... ...it was <span style="color:#E16935">her body</span> that was left lying there... Maya Fey... I wasn't able to kill her with my own hands after all. But even so... I made her commit the most vile sin a human can commit.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And that is...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Matricide. The sin of killing her own mother!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ugggh... NOOOO WAY!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Or-Order! Order in the court! What is the meaning of this!?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
It's true that I was the one who attacked Maya Fey... But even so... ...the <span style="color:#E16935">murderer</span> who actually snuffed out Misty Fey's life was none other than... ...your darling little Maya!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
R-Ridiculous! That's nonsense...
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Are you sure about that? ...Just think about it. There's even <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> supporting these facts, isn't there?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What...!? What do you mean? Wh-What is this so-called evidence!?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...The fact that <span style="color:#E16935">Maya Fey has disappeared</span> is evidence enough, isn't it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
The idea that she's still in the Sacred Cavern is just ridiculous. She wasn't able to escape from the Inner Temple, that much is obvious. In that case, there is only one place she could be.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-Where...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Do I have to spell it out? ...The <span style="color:#E16935">bottom of the Eagle River</span>, where else?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Ea-Eagle River...!?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Maya Fey killed her long-lost mother. Can you imagine the guilt she must have felt when she realized that? That's why she threw herself into the Eagle River. Most bodies that wind up in there are lost forever. So, what do you have to say now... Feenie?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ooooh... Uuuuuhhhh...
</p><p>Phone:<br />
<span style="color:green">.........</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...Oops. Sorry, that's my phone.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Phone:

<center><span style="color:green">...*beep*...</span></center>

<p><br />
Judge:<br />
W-Was it something important?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
They just finished removing the locks from the Sacred Cavern.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's great! What about Maya?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
... There was a woman in the cave...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Was it Maya Fey...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
It was the accused... Sister Iris.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Don't look so surprised. ...I locked her in there yesterday. I just got finished telling you that.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So... what about Maya? Where is she?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
... There was no one else found inside the Sacred Cavern.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
N-No... It can't be...
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
I told you, didn't I? She's dead.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
No... Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
It seems... ...that this case has come to an end... A tragic end... Sadly, it appears the killer of Elise Deauxnim, also known as Misty Fey... ...was her own daughter, Maya Fey. Overcome with guilt for what she had done... ...Maya Fey jumped to her death into the raging waters of the Eagle River!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It can't be...)</span>
</p>
<center>...Ha!...</center>
<p><br />
Godot:<br />
Trite... Have you ever heard this one? "Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>." ...No matter how improbable it may seem.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh... What is that supposed to mean, Prosecutor Godot...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
According to this witness... ...Maya Fey threw herself into the Eagle River. However... is that really the truth?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Remember, this woman testified earlier that... ...<span style="color:#E16935">the bridge was already on fire</span> when the murder was taking place in the garden. Which means if Maya had thrown herself into the river... ...it must have been from the <span style="color:#E16935">Inner Temple side</span>, near the bridge.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
That's right! That's where she jumped from...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
But that's impossible. It's <span style="color:#E16935">impossible</span> to jump into the river from there!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Wh-What...!?)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Don't get your panties all twisted up, Trite. Just relax and think through the whole thing again.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So it's <span style="color:#E16935">impossible</span>...? Maya couldn't have thrown herself into Eagle River...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Well, Mr. Wright? Ms. Hawthorne claims Ms. Fey threw herself into the river from the Inner Temple side. <span style="color:green">Do you have any evidence that refutes this claim?</span>

Eleven years ago, you jumped into the very same river!

Oh... Ooooh! Y-You're right!

Yes, just a few minutes ago.

...Correct. That eliminates all the most likely possibilities.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
... Well...
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>...Me, of course...</center>
<p><br />
Phoenix:<br />
M... Mia!
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Mia Fey!
</p><p>Mia:<br />
It's been a long time, Dahlia Hawthorne...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
... ...So it's true... It was you.
</p><p>Mia:<br />
...Yes.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Ha...! You're something else...
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
B-But what... what are you doing here...!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That hair... It's Pearls, right?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Tell me something, Dahlia... I want you to think back to that night one more time. You had just cornered Maya in the Inner Temple's garden. And then... in the final moments of the fight, you <span style="color:#E16935">lost consciousness</span>.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
I was stabbed! By Maya Fey!
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Actually... <span style="color:#E16935">Maya lost consciousness</span> at the same time as you.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...She did?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Not terribly surprising since she was about to be killed.
</p><p>Mia:<br />
...When she woke up, she was in the Training Hall. That's when Maya decided she needed help... So she <span style="color:#E16935">channeled</span> me. She explained in a memo the situation she was in. She asked me what I thought she should do.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
She did that...? I can't believe it...
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Of course, I didn't have all the details. But... One thing was perfectly clear.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And that was...?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
I knew that you couldn't be allowed to wander free.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Free</span>...? What do you mean?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
It was a race against time, so I wrote down two things that Maya had to do. <span style="color:#E16935">Channel</span> Dahlia Hawthorne as soon as possible... ...and <span style="color:#E16935">lock herself in the Sacred Cavern</span> until help arrived.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So it was Maya who put that lock on there...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, but why did you order her to do those two things?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
If she hadn't done it... ...Dahlia Hawthorne would've been channeled by <span style="color:#E16935">someone else</span>. By one <span style="color:#E16935">Pearl Fey</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
P-Pearls?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Yes. Pearl didn't properly understand the plan. So all she was trying to do was follow her mother, Morgan Fey's instructions. If she had succeeded in channeling Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit... ...things would have turned out very badly, to put it mildly.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
......... ...So that's how it was. Dahlia Hawthorne would have used the body of Pearl Fey... ...to kill Maya at all costs.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Y-Yes, it certainly sounds like that was the intent all along.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
H-How dare you!? I-I won't forget this...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Why not just admit it? ...Dahlia Hawthorne. Your little plan was nothing but a big failure.
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Yes... Another failure to add to the pile of shame, wouldn't you say?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Wh-What do you mean by <span style="color:#E16935">another</span>!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Think about it, Dahlia. Remember all your past crimes? Not a single one of them was a success. They all ended in failure.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
What...!? How dare you...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
11 years ago... The fake kidnapping... Your very first crime. You got your hands on a 2 million dollar diamond. But... ...after Terry Fawles escaped and went to meet with Valerie Hawthorne... ...the truth was exposed.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Sh-Shut your mouth! That wasn't my fault! It was because of that stupid oaf of a prisoner and that weakling of a policewoman!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And then... one year later. You tried to kill me.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well... I'm still alive, but... ...you wound up killing someone else. As a result, you were sentenced to death. ...It's one stupid move after another for you. But it's no longer funny.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
You...! Wipe that smug, happy-go-lucky smile off your face...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And now this! You've messed up again! You let Maya Fey escape. Even though she was right there in front of you!
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...Grr...Mmm...Nnnn... Grrr... Ahh! M... M... Mia F... F... Fey Mia Fey! Mia Fey! MIA FEEEEY! You... You... spinster!! I was supposed to kill Maya Fey like I swore I would! And if only you had gotten this spiky-haired jerk the guilty verdict... ...I wouldn't have been hanged to death!
</p><p>Mia:<br />
...... True.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...!
</p><p>Mia:<br />
But I think you finally understand, Dahlia Hawthorne. ...You will never defeat me.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Wh-What...!? What did you say!?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Whether you're alive, dead, or somewhere in between, you will never defeat me. As long as I'm around, you're destined to lose for all of eternity!
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
Grrr... Grrrr... Grrrrr...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...I remember what you said earlier in the trial. You said there was no way we could punish you... ...because you were already <span style="color:#E16935">dead</span>.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
What about it!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Then you said... "Even when the body dies, the spirit, the <span style="color:#E16935">ego</span>, it lives on... forever."
</p><p>Mia:<br />
...That's very true, Dahlia. And that's exactly the <span style="color:#E16935">punishment</span> you'll never be able to escape from.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...!
</p><p>Mia:<br />
For all of eternity, you'll have to remain as Dahlia Hawthorne. A miserable, pathetic, weak creature who can never win at anything... And for you, there is no escape from that. No hope of freedom. Since the day you were executed... ...the narrow bridge that once stretched out in front of you has burnt to a crisp!
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...Y-You... OoOooOOh... ...Y-You'RE... wROnG... ...It... CAN'T... be... ...How... coULd... I... ...loSe... to... THe... ...likES... of... YOU...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It no longer matters! I don't care whether you win or lose anymore. The only thing I want... ...is for you to come out of Maya's body right now!
</p><p>Dahlia:<br />
...... ...... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ...I'M... NOT... READY... ...NOT... READY... TO... GO...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
...Nick... ...Sis...

<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Now then... I assume you are the real Iris...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...Yes. I was just rescued from the Sacred Cavern.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I must say you and your twin sister are indeed identical from what I can see. In any case... It appears that everything has finally been cleared up. Mr. Godot. ...What happened to Dahlia Hawthorne?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
If you ask me, Your Honor... ...it looks like she went back to the hell she came from.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... It seems that Misty Fey wasn't the only victim of this crime. Maya Fey, as well as the young Pearl Fey... ...were also victims of this wicked and selfish plan.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The tragedy of "Medium Valley" has finally come to an end, it seems. It would be best for everyone if no further attempt was made to channel that spirit again.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............ Umm... Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, what is it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
About this whole "spirit medium" thing... It's almost weird how comfortable you seem to be with the concept now.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
... Well, to be frank, my younger brother is quite judgmental... He often criticizes me for not studying hard enough. That's why I made a concerted effort to study up on the Kurain Channeling Technique.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hey! Isn't that the New Year's issue of "Oh! Cult!"!?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...I've seen quite a few things in my many years on the bench. And in all that time, I've finally learned this one thing. Each case is different, and takes place in its own world, if you will. In order to fully understand that world... ...first we have to immerse ourselves in it completely. And that's where... My brother and I used to differ.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm, never thought of it that way...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...At any rate! It's time to pass judgment in the case of Iris of Hazakura Temple.
</p><p>Godot:<br />

</p><p>Godot:<br />
...You're a little too fast with that gavel, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What do you mean by that, Mr. Godot!?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
This trial... It isn't over yet. ...That's what he means.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
W-What!?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Trite... Remember what Miss Evil Spirit said in her testimony?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh? Dahlia's testimony?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Dahlia:<br />
I caught up with her in front of the stone lantern. Then I took out the dagger I got from the storeroom and... ............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that. I think... I think <span style="color:#E16935">I was stabbed</span>.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Mia:<br />
...Just as Dahlia Hawthorne was about to attack Maya... ...she was stabbed and "<span style="color:#E16935">killed</span>" by someone.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Y-Yes... That's right...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
The person that was ultimately killed was the spirit medium that channeled Dahlia... ...Elise Deauxnim, no, Misty Fey. But... <span style="color:#E16935">who killed her</span>? We still don't know who did it!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Th-This isn't over!?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Unless someone else is found guilty, the accused is still on trial. We can't let her walk until there is evidence that proves her innocence.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
N-No way...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But... This court isn't prepared for any further testimony...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
The prosecution is ready to call our final witness!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
F-Final... <span style="color:#E16935">witness</span>!?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
This one will clear up the whole mystery... The mystery of "<span style="color:#E16935">Who killed Misty Fey</span>"!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Hmm, indeed!
</p><p>Mia:<br />
... Is it really alright... Mr. Prosecutor?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
... Of course it's alright... Madame Attorney.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well then... Who is this final witness?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Ha...! Isn't it obvious? There's one person who saw the whole event and will put the final dagger in this case.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
S-Someone who <span style="color:#E16935">saw</span> the murder take place...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...The very person who saw her mother killed in front of her own eyes.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-You mean... Maya!? ...You can't! She can't testify after what she's just been through!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
We need to find the truth. The prosecution calls Maya Fey to the witness stand!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Very well. But first, we'll take a brief recess. ...We'll have to wait for Ms. Fey to recover before summoning her. Once we receive the doctor's permission, we will proceed with the trial!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...Hey, Trite. I've got something to say to you, so listen up.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...What is it?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
I don't think much of you as a lawyer. It's always the same with you. ...You somehow manage to just squeak by without even a faint understanding of the case. Some beautiful woman always seems to come dashing in at the last minute to save you.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-You've got some nerve!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...But that's not going to happen this time. This time... you're going to have to do this by yourself.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That's enough! This court is now in recess!

District Court<br />Defendant Lobby No. 1</span></center>
<p><br />
Iris:<br />
I'm truly sorry about everything. You were working so hard to defend me... But I was missing all day, and we didn't even have a chance to talk...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...She's right. When I met "Iris" at the Training Hall yesterday... ...they had <span style="color:#E16935">already switched places</span>... and Iris was inside the Sacred Cavern.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...I wanted to at least be in the defendant's box today to root you on.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
W-Well, it wasn't you fault. You were locked up this whole time... There's something more important than that, though. I have to ask you... Why did you help your sister out as much as you did?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Huh...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
If you had tried to get help at the Sacred Cavern yesterday... ...you wouldn't have spent an entire day locked up in there.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
... My sister... I felt sorry for her. She was abandoned by our mother and never got any love from our father either.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes, but... it was the same for you too, wasn't it?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, but at least I had Sister Bikini, who was like a mother to me. If only Dahlia had come with me to Hazakura Temple... I always... I always loved her... Dahlia was always so smart, so strong... She never complained about a thing. That's why I... That's why I promised her that I would help her.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Are you talking about the fake kidnapping case 11 years ago?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...Yes. I-I wanted to be useful to her in some way... B-But, as usual... I was too cowardly... At the last minute, I ran away. Because of that... Dahlia's half-sister, Valerie, ended up...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That was the case that wounded Mia so badly...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But... things didn't end there, of course. Some people suspected that my sister was involved in the murder.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Some people...? You must mean...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, two defense lawyers. Mia Fey... and Diego Armando. After poisoning Mr. Armando, who was getting too close to learning the truth... ...Dahlia even tried to kill the person who had unknowingly hid the poison for her. You.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...That's right...)</span> ...Iris. There's one more thing that I have to ask you.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, what is it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
On the night of the murder... ...the person that cleaned up the corpse of the victim, Elise Deauxnim... Was it... Was it really you?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
... Yes... It was me. That night, after I rang the lights out bell... I went back to my room. At around 10:30, I received a call on my cell phone.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phone:<br />
<span style="color:green">......... ...*beep*...</span>
</p><p><span style="color:green">"There's a problem... Come to the Inner Temple right away."</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Iris:<br />
I... I got on the snowmobile and headed for the Inner Temple. But...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The path to the Inner Temple was cut off... Right?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Exactly.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phone:<br />
<span style="color:green">......... ...*beep*...</span>
</p><p><span style="color:green">"We can't just leave the body here... ...Alright, let's do this as you said..."</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Iris:<br />
It was me... I was the one that received her body. The <span style="color:#E16935">murder weapon</span> had been left in her body so she wouldn't bleed too much. The <span style="color:#E16935">staff</span> that Mystic Elise always held...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I knew it... So the actual murder weapon was the staff.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...Yes, that's right. I brought the body back to Hazakura Temple on the snowmobile.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But why... Why did you alter the body?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...I didn't want anyone to know that the staff was the murder weapon. I didn't want to leave anything that would lead back to Misty Fey... So I dressed her in a robe and stabbed her with the Shichishito... I wiped the blood off the staff's blade and left it next to her on the ground.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Iris. Just tell me one last thing. Tell me the name of the person that called your cell phone. The <span style="color:#E16935">real killer</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... I can't do it... I can't say who did it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
... I... I see...
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Victim's Staff updated in the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
...Defendant!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...Y-Yes...
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
The judge is calling you! He wants you to see you in his chambers. He has some questions about Dahlia Hawthorne.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...Alright. ... Well then... I'll see you later... There's something I want to tell you later.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Oh, um... OK... <span style="color:#0070C0">("Something she wants to tell me"? So it's true... Iris cooperated with the real <span style="color:#E16935">killer</span>... Maybe even from the very beginning!)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br />
...Phoenix.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Mia...! Umm... H-How is Maya doing!?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Physically, I'm not worried. She'll recover completely. But emotionally, she's been hurt very badly by this case.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I-I see... ...! You don't mean...! She's learned who Elise Deauxnim really was?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
...Yes. I went to the medical office and talked with her. I told her everything I knew.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...But why?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Maya is stronger than you think... I knew she could take it... All of it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
I want you to figure that answer out by yourself. ...The trial is about to restart. The real killer... Do you know who it is yet?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Iris wouldn't tell me who called her. But still... I think that just maybe... I know who it was.)</span> That night, the victim was killed in the garden of the Inner Temple. And the criminal wasn't just there by accident. Which means... ...that the killer <span style="color:#E16935">knew</span> of Dahlia's plan from the very beginning.
</p><p>Mia:<br />
...And one more thing. The victim was moved to the Hazakura Temple side by pendulum. In other words... the criminal <span style="color:#E16935">couldn't cross the bridge</span>. That means they were stuck on the Inner Temple side for almost an entire day.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Exactly. So the criminal... ...was someone that <span style="color:#E16935">wasn't in Hazakura Temple</span> the following day...!)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br />
... That's as much help as I can give you. The rest of the battle is yours to win... or lose.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
OK, I've got it. ...Thank you, Mia.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Finally... It's almost time to bring this case to an end. What exactly did Maya see anyway...? And who was it that actually killed Misty Fey? Whoever it was, I have to prove it... Me. All by myself.)</span>

Judge:<br />
Now then, before we proceed any further... ...I'm going to announce the results of the tests we had performed earlier.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Tests...?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, tests. On the bloody dagger that was found stuck in the pine tree.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Oh yeah! That! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I totally forgot about it.)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
That's the <span style="color:#E16935">weapon</span> that Maya Fey used when she fought with the victim.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So what are the results!? Was it the victim's blood, or...?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Due to time constraints, a full test wasn't possible. However... There's one thing we can say with certainty. The blood that was on this dagger was not the victim's blood! ...That is all. Now then, let's restart this trial.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So it <span style="color:#E16935">wasn't Misty's</span> blood on the dagger... Then whose was it...?)</span>

</p><p>Judge:<br />
I'm sure both the defense and the prosecution know this, but... ...this trial is rapidly coming to a close. Both sides will need to show some firm evidence with their claims.

I understand, Your Honor.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
From what I've heard... ...the witness is dangerously weak, physically speaking. So, let's finish this quickly.

I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened.<br />
Suddenly, someone struck me over the head...<br />
I stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern.<br />
I think I screamed, "Help me!"<br />
Then something warm splashed over me...<br />
That's when... I lost consciousness.<br />

<p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... So you were struck on the head... I suppose it must have been this staff.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Maya! The person who hit you... It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it!?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
I-I'm sorry, Nick. I just... I couldn't see... I don't know who it was...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Maya, think hard...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Sorry, Nick, but I really couldn't!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Ha...! Can't say it was an especially good night for young ladies to be walking around alone.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It seems that it will be hard to determine the criminal through testimony alone. Very well then, Mr. Wright. Please begin your cross-examination...

Well, Sister Bikini of course! But I remember her saying that Iris would be coming later as well.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(On the day after the incident, Edgeworth met Bikini at Hazakura Temple. That means she <span style="color:#E16935">couldn't be the criminal</span>.)</span> So then... did Iris actually come later like she said?

...Add the pureness of milk to the perfect, clear darkness of coffee. Stir. That is the state of the witness's mind right now -- a cup of café au lait.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
C-Café o' Lay? Is that even legal...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Mr. Trite's words are the milk and you are the spoon, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I-I'm a spoon!? I'm no spoony bard, I'll have you know!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
You must have noticed it too, Trite. ...This witness's mental state is highly unstable right now. It's not hard to understand why she would make a little mistake like that.

Sorry, but that's not going to cut it!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...What did you say!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
If there truly was no light in the garden... ...then there's a fatal <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span> in the witness's last bit of testimony!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
N-Nick...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...May I? Recall the witness's statement about her attacker. She said that she didn't know if it was a man or a woman, an adult or a child. ...And yet! The witness could describe a person that was standing <span style="color:#E16935">behind</span> her attacker... And she quite clearly described him as a <span style="color:#E16935">man</span>!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Ah...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...In other words! That would have to mean that Maya <span style="color:#E16935">actually saw</span> our mystery person! Despite it being so dark that she couldn't see the face of the attacker in front of her!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
N... NOOOOOOOOOO!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Or-Order! Order! Order! What in the world does this all mean, Mr. Wright!? Are you saying Ms. Fey saw the real killer under pitch black conditions!?

There are some things that you can <span style="color:#E16935">only see in the dark</span>, Mr. Godot.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Maya, you did see who the killer was in the dark. And now... you're <span style="color:#E16935">trying to cover</span> for him.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
C-Cover...!? For the man that killed her mother...!?

By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed...<br />
The torches were lit... And the body was gone.<br />
And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.<br />
Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... So it was after the crime took place that the witness came to think the killer was a man.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Yes... That's right...I'm sorry, Your Honor, I...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
No need to apologize. It's as Mr. Godot said... You're utterly exhausted. It's only natural that you would be a little confused.
</p><p>Godot:<br />

Also, if you consider the situation you described... ...it doesn't seem too much of a stretch to assume the criminal was a man. Mr. Wright. Proceed with your cross-examination.

So you're saying the killer cleaned up the snow? <span style="color:#0070C0">(It did look really odd... The snow was removed in an unnatural-looking rectangular shape around the lantern...)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br />
There were a lot of shovels around the Inner Temple. But they're all really heavy. Way too heavy for me to use.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...An odd fellow indeed, this killer. Why on earth would anyone want to take snow away?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well there's one thing I can think of... Didn't you say that a lot of the <span style="color:#E16935">victim's blood</span> sprayed onto the snow?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Y-Yeah... The area I collapsed in ended up being splattered.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
In other words... ...the killer's purpose was to <span style="color:#E16935">hide</span> the bloody snow. I think that's the most reasonable explanation.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm, perhaps... However, there's something that's bothering me. If the killer just wanted to hide the snow with blood on it... ...there was no need to remove that amount.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's true... He could have scooped up <span style="color:#E16935">just the snow that was stained with blood</span>.)</span>

<p>Phoenix:<br />
The body of Elise Deauxnim was carried all the way to Hazakura Temple's courtyard. Then at the garden, the real scene of the crime... ...the snow that we suspect was covered in blood was scooped up and removed. It's reasonable to believe all this was done in an attempt to hide the true crime scene. However... There's still <span style="color:#E16935">one matter</span> that still seems <span style="color:#E16935">somewhat odd</span>.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Oh? And what would that be?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You must have figured it out by now, Mr. Godot... It's the <span style="color:#E16935">message written in blood</span> on the lantern.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It was written very clearly on the white stone lantern. "<span style="color:#E16935">Maya</span>"...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
If the killer was so motivated to <span style="color:#E16935">protect Maya</span> from suspicion... ...then why didn't he wipe the writing off the lantern?

Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!<br />

<p>Judge:<br />
Who is this "Pearly"...?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
That's my little cousin! Pearl Fey.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... So when did you hear about this?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Oh, just a while ago... When I was in the medical office.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I'm terribly sorry... But what you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Whaaaat!? Come on! Pearly would never tell a lie! She's a way more honest person than I'll ever be!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Real smart, Maya. You always know the best things to say when you're under oath...)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Ha...! The prosecution has no objection. We believe the witness.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
M-Mr. Godot!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Let's just move on to the cross-examination... If the defense has no objections...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Th-This is highly unusual, but... Well, Mr. Wright!?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So where did do you think Pearls slept that night?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
In the spare prep room next to the Training Hall, I guess. There's a rule that you can't enter the Training Hall during an acolyte's training.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But even so, why did she go to the Inner Temple in the first place?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It seems that Pearls became very worried about Maya.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
She knew that the spiritual training I was about to undergo was very intense.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Pearls was supposed to channel Dahlia Hawthorne... But she couldn't do it. That's why she headed to the Inner Temple. However, Dahlia Hawthorne was already there... ...possessing the body of <span style="color:#E16935">Elise Deauxnim</span>.)</span>

She searched the entire Inner Temple side, end to end...?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Well, you see... Pearly gets pretty scared when she's alone. And there weren't that many places to look... She says that she even went back and forth several times.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The Inner Temple side has two structures: the Training Hall and a spare prep room...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
And there's also a storage shack, I think... That's about it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(There was a storage shack, too?)</span> ...Pearls was looking for other people, right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Would she have really examined a storage shack all that carefully...?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The morning after the crime, someone covered it with gravy.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ah, that. It's the mark of the <span style="color:#E16935">Master</span>, correct?

Exactly! So if you know the meaning of the mark...

Oh...

Yes, it's possible that he knew what the crest meant. ...However! He couldn't have known that she was wearing <span style="color:#E16935">Japanese clothing</span>! Mr. Godot!

Can I ask you just one little thing, Trite?

This whole theory of yours... It all rests on a certain assumption. That I <span style="color:#E16935">knew beforehand</span> that a crime was going to be committed.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Th-That's right! Otherwise there's no reason for him to sneak onto the crime scene...

<p>Phoenix:<br />
...This crime was actually planned <span style="color:#E16935">over a year ago</span>. Morgan Fey authored the plan for her daughter's future... ...and these instructions were hidden somewhere in Fey Manor for a year... However, by the time little Pearls found these instructions... ...they had already been <span style="color:#E16935">unsealed</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Unsealed...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes. The killer had read these instructions long before Pearls ever found them. That's how he knew the crime was to take place at the Inner Temple!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
And you're saying this crafty killer... is me?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You bet I am.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
But you just said that the instructions were <span style="color:#E16935">hidden</span>...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Th-That's right! Mr. Godot couldn't have known where the instructions were hidden!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
If he really wanted to know, he had one great chance to find out.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Y-Yes, and when was that...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...During a <span style="color:#E16935">visit</span>.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
A visit?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Morgan Fey told her daughter, Pearl, about where the instructions were hidden... ...during one of her <span style="color:#E16935">visits to the detention center</span>. That would be the only time for someone to have learned where they were hidden.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ea-<span style="color:#E16935">Eavesdropping</span> on a visit at the detention center!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes, it could be arranged if you were someone with easy access in and out of there. Like for example, a prosecutor such as Mr. Godot!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! Order! M-Mr. Godot...! You're under fire again!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...This murder could not have been carried out without prior knowledge! And you...! You were the only one that could've acquired this information before the murder.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...Humans are afraid of the dark. And yet... At the same time, we're fascinated and bewitched by it. Maybe that's why humans drink the darkness that is coffee.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Umm... Sorry for always asking, but what does that mean?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
It means there's a reason for everything. According to your theory, the killer in this case eavesdropped... ...on a conversation during a jail visit where he learned of a hidden plan for a crime.  After discovering the plans, he hid in the Inner Temple and waited for the crime to occur. Then he ultimately took a person's life. ...And he did all of that just to protect this witness?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's right.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
If you're accusing me of this crime, I have to ask you... Why would I do this? This girl is nothing but a stranger to me. I've got no reason to go through that kind of trouble to protect her. I am what you see. I am certainly not the type to rescue the damsel in distress.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... The killer's behavior is... certainly... <span style="color:#E16935">extreme</span>... for lack of a better word. Even considering that the killer wanted to protect this witness's life... ...his behavior is still a little too unnatural!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
However... ...you had a good reason didn't you, Mr. Godot? An <span style="color:#E16935">unshakable reason</span> that forced you to protect this witness at all costs!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
...... I knew it... You've figured it out, haven't you, Nick...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Maya... I guess you were doing your best to cover for Godot... ...for the same reason, huh?)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
OK, Trite. I'm all ears. ...Let's hear it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It's very simple... Maya Fey is a lot more than just a stranger to you.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-What's this...!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
There's <span style="color:#E16935">one person</span> who lies at the very center of this whole story. <span style="color:green">One person that ties you and Maya Fey together inextricably!</span>

</p><p>Godot:<br />
...Sorry, but at this point in my life, I'm a lone wolf. I've got no connection to that person whatsoever.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, and by the way, I don't have any connection with them either, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What am I doing...? If I think about Godot's <span style="color:#E16935">true identity</span>, the answer is obvious!)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
How's it going, Trite? I knew it... Has this whole trial just been too much for you...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Yeah, maybe. I'm not sure... But I am sure about one thing!
</p><p><i>Leads back to:</i><br />
"Maya Fey is a lot more than just a stranger to you."
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Phoenix:<br />
There's a very good reason why Maya Fey's life is so precious to you! After all... She is <span style="color:#E16935">Mia Fey's</span> only sister.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
...!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Mia... Fey.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You once worked alongside her. That was when you... were a <span style="color:#E16935">defense attorney</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
W-Wait a second here! Mr. Godot is... is a defense attorney!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
With Your Honor's piercing intellect, you must have figured it out by now... The real name of this man who calls himself "Godot"... His real name is... <span style="color:#E16935">Diego Armando</span>. Isn't that right?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
The last time someone called me by that name... ...was over 6 years ago.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Diego Armando... That name rings a bell...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It should, Your Honor. All of this is related to a single case... A case in which a convict named Terry Fawles killed himself... Mia Fey's first time in court. The tragic outcome left a deep wound in her heart. She knew that behind it all was a heartless, scheming demoness in disguise. But in the end, Mia couldn't tear off that disguise. However, there was one man who reached out to help her. ...Diego Armando, a senior defense lawyer at the office where Mia worked.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Mia:<br />
It's my fault! It's all my fault that Mr. Fawles killed himself!
</p><p>Armando:<br />
............... Mia... You can't cry yet. The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Godot:<br />
... I was moved by her... The way she put all her faith in her clients... That pure, sweet heart of hers... That's why... I could never forgive Dahlia Hawthorne. Mia and I thoroughly investigated that fake kidnapping incident. Then one fateful day, Dahlia wanted to meet with me... It had been 6 months since the trial... We met in the courthouse cafeteria.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah...! I just remembered! 6 years ago! Right here in this courthouse! You were <span style="color:#E16935">poisoned</span>...!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Even I didn't see it coming. Dahlia Hawthorne slipped some poison into my coffee.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Some newspapers at the time called it a <span style="color:#E16935">murder</span>. But very little information about the case was released to the press...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But you <span style="color:#E16935">weren't dead</span> at all!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
No official reports ever actually called it a <span style="color:#E16935">murder</span>. I was just in a deep, deep coma...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I see...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...My body shut down, and my life became nothing but a long, deep sleep. That woman's poison did a real number on my central nervous system... I lost my sight, and all of my hair turned white due to the damage it caused.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
That's terrible...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Apparently it was a miracle that I ever regained consciousness. Five years had passed since I drank that poisoned brew... Then one morning, my eyes flew open... from the smell of a doctor's cup of coffee.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
F-Five years...!? You were asleep for 5 years!?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
And the worst possible news was waiting for me... ...Mia Fey was dead. From the very moment I opened my eyes... I had already lost everything I thought I had. The woman I loved had been murdered... And the woman I loathed had been sentenced to death.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The woman you loathed...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
The woman who had spiked my scalding hot coffee... Dahlia Hawthorne! Ha...! Good ol' Mia. She didn't let me down. She got her revenge before she checked out. In the end... There wasn't anyone waiting for me when I woke up.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Th-That's so sad...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
For someone like me... For someone who had slept away their best days... ...there were only <span style="color:#E16935">2 reasons</span> left to live. And it was for those 2 reasons that I decided to become a prosecutor.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
If I may ask... What were your <span style="color:#E16935">2 reasons to live</span>...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
The first was you, Trite.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh...!? M... M-Me?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
If I hadn't drank that stupid poison... ...Mia Fey never would have died, much less the way she did.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
You were the only one who was there to protect her! But you let her die. It was all your fault.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I... It wasn't like that...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
I wanted to see for myself what kind of a man you really were.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
S-So that's why you became a prosecutor?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
My other reason for living... She goes by the name of Maya Fey.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Huh? You mean me...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
You were the only way I could make up for the sin of not saving Mia. One year ago, when the Kurain Village incident was resolved... ...it was obvious that Morgan Fey was planning something. Whatever her evil plan was, I was determined to stop it. My role as a <span style="color:#E16935">prosecutor</span> put me in the perfect position to do something about her.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's how you overheard Pearls's visit with Morgan at the detention center.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
I knew that the time was drawing near. Since I knew the plan, I thought I could foil it. My goal was to outwit the plan. I thought if I could do that... ...I could keep that girl from being caught up in it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That makes sense... If Pearls had known that the actual purpose of the plan was to <span style="color:#E16935">kill Maya</span>... ...she never would have helped out.)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Finally, the day of the plan was drawing near... I contacted both of my accomplices.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Accomplices</span>...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Iris</span> of Hazakura Temple and... <span style="color:#E16935">Misty Fey</span>. I especially needed the help of Iris... She was to <span style="color:#E16935">take the fall</span> in my back-up plan in case we couldn't control Pearl Fey.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
B-But...! How did you contact my mother!? She had been missing for almost 20 years!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Officially, yes...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
What!? What do you mean, <span style="color:#E16935">officially</span>!?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
You've heard about it, haven't you? About the strong ties between the main family and the government...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Now that you mention it... Bikini did say something to that effect... She said that the Master of Kurain had great authority...)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Even without her official position, Misty Fey still wielded great influence... The police have been keeping an eye on her movements all this time. That's how I was able to contact her... Again, because of my position as a <span style="color:#E16935">prosecutor</span>.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
So my mother... was cooperating with you?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Don't ever forget... ...no matter how far away from you she was, she never stopped thinking about you.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Sh-She was always...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
That's why... I knew she would do anything to protect you. If you want to know how strong her resolve to protect you was, look at her <span style="color:#E16935">staff</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Her staff...? The one with the sword in it?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
The day the plan was to be carried out arrived soon enough... We met for the first time at Hazakura Temple. That's when your mother showed me her special staff... I realized it then... Just how far she was willing to go... She was ready to use that sword to protect you from Morgan Fey, if necessary. ...Yes! Even if it meant paying the ultimate price.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
M-Mother...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
That night... The night of the crime. There was just <span style="color:#E16935">one way</span> to stop Morgan's evil plan.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You mean Pearls, don't you?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
We had to make sure she didn't channel Dahlia Hawthorne...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Elise:<br />
...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Well, umm...
</p><p>Elise:<br />
If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Godot:<br />
We thought we could prevent her from playing her part in Morgan's plan. But... She never showed up.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
She was worried and followed me to the Inner Temple...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
That was the thing we were most afraid of. And that's why... Misty Fey had to do the channeling herself. She channeled Dahlia Hawthorne into her own body.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What...!? What do you mean!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
If she channeled the spirit first... ...then Pearls wouldn't be able to do it herself.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
...!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
As Master of Kurain, Misty Fey's power was supreme. So that's how it went down. She channeled Dahlia Hawthorne so that Pearl Fey <span style="color:#E16935">wouldn't be able to</span>!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Ah...! Whaaaaaaaat!?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What...!? Is this true!?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
My role in the plan was to make sure no one was going to hurt Maya Fey. That's why... I hid myself at the Inner Temple. Just in case you needed to be saved from Dahlia Hawthorne.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Godot...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Anyway... That's all I'm going to admit to... Trite.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
There's no doubt about it. You're a great defense lawyer. But... you're going to have to do the rest yourself.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The background leading up to this incident has been laid bare. There's just one question remaining, Mr. Wright. "Who killed the victim?" There are only two possible suspects right now. Maya Fey... And I'm sad to say... you, Mr. Godot!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Well, Trite... If you're the real deal... ...then finish this thing once and for all. Show us beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can finish this on your own!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
N-No, Nick...! P-Please don't!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
M... Maya...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
I... I heard the whole thing. From my sister... In the medical office...! That's why! That's why... I have to protect Mr. Godot...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
I can't do it... I can't testify against him... After all... ...he's the man who put his life on the line to protect Mia... and me, too!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Maya... I know that!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
N-Nick...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But even so... It doesn't absolve him of his crime! ...Please, Maya. Testify.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ms. Fey. Your testimony please.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
This is the final testimony. Don't bother trying to hide anything, because I'll know. I want to hear the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> from your own lips...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
...... I understand. I'm sure you're right... I'm ready now, Nick...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Alright, young lady... Tell us about the moments before you lost consciousness. What exactly happened at the time of the murder!?

<p>Maya:<br />
...Just before it happened, I think I saw some red lights. Three of them.<br />
I thought I'd ask for help, but... just then I was splattered with blood!<br />
She wasn't dead though... And she struck back at the enemy behind her.<br />
Suddenly, the red lights went out and the whole area was dark.<br />
...Just at that moment, there was a horrible scream!<br />
Right after that... Dahlia collapsed and I lost consciousness.<br />
</p>

<p>Judge:<br />
These <span style="color:#E16935">red lights</span>... I thought you said you don't remember seeing them!
</p><p>Maya:<br />

</p><p>Godot:<br />
Ha...! Things break, Trite... Even the best of theories.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Who was it that stabbed Misty Fey? It looks like you still can't prove it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Maya is telling the truth this time, I know it... The rest is up to me!)</span>

That blood... Was it Dahlia Hawthorne's blood...?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
I think so, probably. Just at that moment... ...I heard a soft scream that seemed to be close by. It was a woman's voice.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So that was when the killer stabbed the victim from behind with the murder weapon... Is that right?

</p><p>Maya:<br />
...Yes, that's right.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The scream that you heard then, was it Dahlia Hawthorne?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
... I don't think so. I'm pretty sure... ...it was a man's voice.

Wha-Wha-Wha... Whaaaaaaaat!? S-So then, that scream came... from the killer!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's got to be it.

Hmm... Hmmm... Hmmmm...!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
I think... ...Dahlia Hawthorne must have taken the blade and attacked the killer with it.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And then the killer let out a scream of pain, huh?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
After that, the killer stole the blade back and delivered the final blow... I guess.

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Y-Yes... What does that prove?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Well, if I really were the killer... ...I could've washed the blade off and then planted <span style="color:#E16935">another person's blood</span> on it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Th-That's... It can't be...!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Are you trying to pressure me, Mr. Godot? Because it doesn't matter to me. I've got the one piece of evidence I need.
</p><p>Godot:<br />
G-Give me a break! You've got nothing, Trite!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So what do I do at a time like this...? It's simple! I've gotta think outside the box and approach this from a <span style="color:#E16935">different angle</span>!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Alright then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you've got.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...There's one thing I've demonstrated in the previous cross-examination. <span style="color:#E16935">The killer was wounded</span>. That was proven by the blood on the dagger.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
B-But... We decided it was <span style="color:#E16935">impossible</span> for him to have hidden such a wound! If he had been cut by a dagger, there should have been a bloodstain on his clothing.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
There's one place... One place the killer <span style="color:#E16935">could have hidden</span> his wound.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-What did you say!?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
H-hidden...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is it! My last stand! I need to think about this from a <span style="color:#E16935">different angle</span>! I don't need to think about <span style="color:#E16935">why</span> there were no bloodstains on his clothing... I need to show <span style="color:#E16935">how</span> he hid the wound!)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br />
It's the end of the line! The final stop, Trite! Let's hear what you've got! <span style="color:green">Where's this location where you say the killer hid his wound!?</span>

<hr />
<p>Godot:<br />
Just now... I saw her spirit in you.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
...... I never liked you. Six years ago... ...you helped the woman who put me to sleep by hiding her bottle of poison. And then... While I was sleeping... ...you let Mia die. But you didn't care. You just kept living your pathetic, happy-go-lucky life. You even had the nerve to follow in her footsteps as a lawyer. I could never forgive you. That's what I thought.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Mr. Godot...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
But... I was wrong about you. I knew it from the very beginning. The truth is, the only person I could never find it in my heart to forgive... ...was me.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Y-You, yourself...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
I was the one that failed to protect Mia... ...Me and no one else. I tried to avert my eyes from the truth... to escape from the harshness of reality. I just couldn't face Mia's death head on, so I ran! I hid behind a mask. I threw away my true name. I couldn't even deal with being a defense attorney anymore, so I quit.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But, but! You saved Maya!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Yeah. That was my plan... Up until just now, anyway.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Wh-What do you mean?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Are you listening, Maya? If I had really wanted to save you... ...then there's one person that I should have gone and talked to right away.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Wh-Who would that be...? Are you talking about Nick?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
But I didn't do it... I tried to get the help of Iris and your mother... But I closed my eyes to the most important man involved. Do you know why? The real reason?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
No... Why?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
I suppose... I wasn't really interested in saving you at all.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Huh...!?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
I think I was just trying to salvage what's left of my own broken soul... I was trying to make up for the fact that I couldn't save Mia. Nothing more. That's why I let you walk right into a situation that I knew was dangerous. Forgive me...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-You're wrong! You put your life on the line to save Maya!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
Was it really for Maya's sake...? Even I'm not really sure.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-What do you mean 
by that...?
</p><p>Godot:<br />
That night, in the darkness of the garden, when I saw her silhouette... A part of me must have known the truth... The truth that it wasn't really Dahlia Hawthorne standing there in front of me.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
...!
</p><p>Godot:<br />
It could have been Misty Fey... Or even that little girl. But I still picked up the blade... It was like I was dreaming! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in my mind at that point... Was I really motivated by the pure desire to protect Maya Fey? Or was it something else...? Was it my hatred for a woman who had stolen everything from me 6 years earlier...? Could it have been simply a desire for <span style="color:#E16935">revenge</span>? And now, I don't know anything anymore! I did learn something today, however. I finally realized that I was the arrogant one. I was just... chasing an illusion, a fantasy. The stupid fantasy of defeating you in the courtroom...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
You were the one who made me realize my folly. You never ran away from Mia's death. Instead, you picked up where she left off, as a true defender of the people. In that one moment... I understood everything!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Mr. Godot...
</p><p>Godot:<br />
I think you already know this, but if you don't... My name is... Diego Armando.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
M-Mr. Armando! I believe in you! I know you were trying to save me!
</p><p>Armando:<br />
Hmm... Thanks.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-Your wound...! It's bleeding!
</p><p>Armando:<br />
...Ha! Did you forget already? In my world, the color red doesn't exist.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Armando:<br />
These must be... my tears.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Tears...?
</p><p>Armando:<br />
Ever since I woke up from my coma... ...I think I've been waiting for this very moment.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
M-Mr. Armando...
</p><p>Armando:<br />
You'd do well to remember this, Maya. The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
This time... It really is all over, isn't it. ...Defendant.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Although you weren't directly involved in the murder... ...tampering with the body and the crime scene is a serious offense in itself.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I understand, Your Honor. Mr. Armando explained that to me very carefully... I knew the risk and I willingly cooperated anyway.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Very well. Before I hand down my verdict, is there anything you'd like to say?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...... Well, there is one thing. I'd like to say something to Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I want to... I want to apologize to you.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Apologize? To me? For what?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
For the case 6 years ago, of course.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I just remembered... Weren't you <span style="color:#E16935">poisoned</span> by your own lover?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Not exactly, but yeah, something like that. Even now... 6 years later, I can hardly believe it. She was going to do it... She was planning to kill me...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...... It's not all that surprising. The two of you... You hardly knew each other.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh...? What do you mean?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You and my sister... You only met twice.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...... Huh. W-We <span style="color:#E16935">only met t-twice</span>?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
The first time you met was on that fateful day... The day she poisoned Mr. Armando in the cafeteria of this very courthouse. The next time you met her was... <span style="color:#E16935">six months later</span>. You met her again on the day that she stole your cold medicine... ...and Doug Swallow was killed.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
N-N-No way! It just... It can't be true! I mean, during our whole relationship, we were...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...... For those 6 months... ...the woman that you thought was Dahlia Hawthorne... ...wasn't actually my sister.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Huh? It <span style="color:#E16935">wasn't Dahlia</span>...?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
... I hope one day you can forgive me... Feenie.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You... Y-Y-You mean...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's right... I lied to you... for 6 months.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
B-But why...!? Why would you do such a thing?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ever since she gave you the bottle that day... ...my sister was trying to get it back as soon as she possibly could. Because of the police investigation and their surveillance... ...she couldn't move about freely.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So that's why you...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
My sister... From the beginning, she was prepared for the worst.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
P-<span style="color:#E16935">Prepared for the worst</span>?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
She thought that you might somehow discover the truth. That's why she was always ready to deal with you at a moment's notice...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You mean she was ready to kill me, don't you...?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
She already had so much to answer for, I didn't want any more sins on her soul. I begged her not to do it, and she agreed to give me a chance.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And that's why... you came to me? You came to get the bottle pendant back from me in her place?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But I couldn't get you to give it back... I failed at something even as simple as that. Six months passed and I still couldn't get it back from you. Finally, my sister couldn't wait any longer. She didn't consult me about her plans for you that day. ...It was the first time that had ever happened.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That was a bit strange, wasn't it? Up until that day, you two were partners in crime, and she would confer with you...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I think... she must have noticed.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...? Noticed what?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
My feelings for you. If I had found out she was planning to kill you... ...I would have done whatever was necessary to stop her. Even if it meant her life... or mine.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I-Iris...!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
After spending half a year by your side... ...my feelings towards you... They changed.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...... I have something to say to you, too.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Y-Yes?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You really are the person I always thought you were. Even after Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... I still believed in you.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...... Thank you.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Armando:<br />
How many cups of darkness have I drank over the years? Even I don't know... I'll tell you though... Right now, this one here is the greatest cup I think I've ever had. Don't you think so... Phoenix Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yeah... I think you're right.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The purpose of this trial was to rule on the <span style="color:#E16935">murder</span> of the victim, Elise Deauxnim. At some point, I expect you will be tried for your role as an accomplice in this case.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...I understand, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well! On the charge of murder, I hereby find the defendant...

You're wrong, Phoenix. You did save Diego. You saved him in the only way possible.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You mean... with that verdict...?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
... I think one day, you'll understand, too. Phoenix, I want you to remember one thing... You were as good out there today as any defense lawyer could ever hope to be. There's nothing more you can learn from me.

</p><p>Maya:<br />

</p><p>von Karma:<br />
I heard he fell into a river and caught a nasty cold which forced him to sleep all day.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, he laid in bed shivering from his fever with Iris's hood pulled over his head.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Oh, ouch! Talk about embarrassing, Nick. You definitely need more training! Anyway, thank you, Mr. Edgeworth! And you too... um... Franziska!

I realized something when I was reborn... ...I realized that Larry was never of any use to anyone. Not even once.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Th-That's not true! Right, Nick!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What? You're asking me!?
</p><p>Butz:<br />
Well, Nick!? Is it true!? I've got a place in this world, right!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh? Oh, um... Y-Yeah, of course. ............

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What!? M-Me?
</p><p>Butz:<br />
Why are you making that face!? Huh, Edgey!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Oh, well, um, yes, indeed... I certainly can't say that it's lacking resemblance.
</p><p>Butz:<br />
Do you really mean it!? What about you, Franzy? Did I draw you well, too!? Waaah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
My beauty can't possibly be captured by a mere crayon!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
...*glare*
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
... Nevertheless, I recognize the effort you put into it and that's worth something.
</p><p>Butz:<br />
So then you'll do it!? Like you promised!? You're going to model for my next picture book, "Franzy's Whip Lash Splash"? Aaaaaah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Don't get carried away!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Butz:<br />
Well, how about that! I guess painting portraits is the only thing I'm good at. The painting of Pearl was pretty darn good too, if you ask me! Huh...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Now that you mention it... I haven't seen her around.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Pearls... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Where could she have gone? Normally she would have made a beeline for Maya...)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Oh... I'll go look for her! Be right back!
</p><p>Hey Pearly...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Wright. You seem to be uncharacteristically puzzled. I suspect you are wondering how Maya can be so cheerful despite all that has happened?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-Yeah...
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
To be honest... I can't understand it either.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Franziska... That's right... She lost her father fairly recently as well...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I think I understand how she feels. Maya is a much wiser person than she appears, and I think she realizes something... Now is exactly the time when she needs to be as strong as she can.
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Wh-What do you mean by, "<span style="color:#E16935">Now is exactly the time</span>"...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Maya wasn't the only one that was badly wounded by this incident. In fact, there was someone that was hurt far more deeply than she. I believe it's for that person that Maya is trying her best not to cry.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(<span style="color:#E16935">Someone</span> who was hurt more deeply than Maya...)</span> Edgeworth... I think I'm starting to understand, too.

Pearl Fey...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The poor kid. After all, the reason that she worked so hard to follow the instructions... ...was because she loved and believed in her mother, Morgan. "It's for the good of the Fey clan"... I'm sure she believed in every last word. She thought she was doing it for Maya... That's why she was so happy. It shows how truly devoted she is to Maya.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
But it's a cruel irony that it was her exuberance that led to this tragedy. Maya Fey's mother was killed and Maya herself was put into the deepest peril imaginable.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

............ ...Why did you just show me that, Phoenix Wright? I have no idea what purpose this is supposed to serve!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
H-Huh?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh. Well, don't worry, Wright... I'm not certain that my guess is entirely correct either. Only Maya can really say what the truth is inside her heart.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It looks like... I still have a lot to learn about Maya.)</span> Aaaaaargh!
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Just as I thought... You have a lot to learn about women, Phoenix Wright!

<p>Gumshoe:<br />
Oh, hey! So this is where you all were! Wow, looks like we've got quite the bunch here toda-- YEOWCH! Wh-What was that for, sir!?
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Sorry about that, Scruffy. ...My whip just seems to have a mind of its own.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What's up, Detective Gumshoe?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Oh, you know. This and that. Anyway, congrats on your win! Let's go out tonight, pal! Dinner's on me! My salary's just sorta kinda gone down by a teeny-weeny bit, but it's alright! I made reservations at a first class French restaurant tonight! AAAAAAH!
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Pretty good work, Scruffy. That whip was your reward.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Umm... Detective Gumshoe. You said a first class French restaurant... You don't mean...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Trés Bien, where else!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I knew it... We're doomed.)</span>
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Come on! Let's go, everyone! Can't keep Maggey waiting, pal! Hey! You! Crybaby! You're invited, too!
</p><p>Butz:<br />
Oh... Forget about me. Pearl and I will be at the losers' shack eating potatoes.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You know... Maya is taking an awfully long time to get back... She's still out looking for Pearls...)</span> Oh... Maya... What's wrong?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Nick... What do I do...? Pearly... I can't find her anywhere!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
I'll bet she just went back home. Th-That's all!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
I thought so too, so I called the village... But no one has heard from her! This has never happened before!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
As I figured... She has been badly hurt by this incident. She feels responsible for the tragedy that has befallen you, Maya.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
B-But... None of this was her fault! What... What should I do...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...... Detective Gumshoe.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yeah, what is it, pal?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Could you guys go on ahead?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
But... But what about you!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Maya and I will... We'll join you guys once we find Pearls.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Nick...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Don't worry about us, Detective Gumshoe. We may be a little late... But we'll definitely be there. We have a lot of celebrating to do tonight, and I wouldn't miss it for the world.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Y-Yeah, but you're the... AAAAAAAAAAAH!
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Very well, Phoenix Wright. We'll go on ahead.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Don't keep us waiting, Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
We won't...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
B-But where should we look!? Where could Pearly have gone...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Let's go, Maya. There's only one place I can think of that Pearls might have gone to...
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">February 10<br />
Hazakura Temple<br />Main Gate</span></center>
<p><br />
Maya:<br />
Hazakura Temple...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
For Pearls, I bet this is a very important place. After all, it's where this whole incident started.
</p><p>Bikini:<br />
What's this? You're all back again so soon?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Sister Bikini?
</p><p>Bikini:<br />
I thought we'd be eating mashed potatoes alone tonight.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
S-So she's here? Pearly is here...?
</p><p>Bikini:<br />
She's in the Training Hall. Why don't you hurry along and go see her?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
O-OK!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Maya:<br />
Pearly's not here...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ah...! Maya! The hanging scroll!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Ah! Someone cleaned it off...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's got to be Pearls...)</span>
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Aaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
P-Pearly...! Why... Why did you just leave like that?
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Mystic Maya... Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Pearl:<br />
I swore... I swore that I would never trouble the two of you ever again. Because... It's all my fault that... Mystic Maya's mother...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's why you came here?
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
It's the least I could do... To pray for your happiness!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
You don't have to do that, Pearly. It wasn't your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. Of course I'm sad that my mother is gone... But... how do I say this? I... I'm still happy.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Y-You don't have to lie just to make me feel better!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
No, really... It's true... The only reason I'm still here at all is thanks to everyone who was there for me.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
...!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
My sis, my mother, Mr. Armando, Nick... And... you. If even one of you weren't there, I'm sure I wouldn't still be alive right now. That's why... I have to be strong. For all the people that were there for me when I needed them. That's all I can really do.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
M-Mystic Maya...
</p><p>Bikini:<br />
I'm impressed... You truly are the daughter of Mystic Misty.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Sister Bikini...!
</p><p>Bikini:<br />
Your mother, Mystic Misty, was a strong woman indeed. I want to tell you what she said to me that night.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Misty:<br />
After dishonoring the good name of Kurain, I don't have the right to face my daughter. But still... Maya is always in my thoughts. It's true... She'll always be with me, until the day I die...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Bikini:<br />
Your spirit was with her... That's why your mother was so strong. Even at the end... I'm sure she had no regrets.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
......
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
"<span style="color:#E16935">She'll always be with me, until the day I die</span>", huh...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
There's a rule or something all Masters are to follow, isn't there? To never take the charm off until the day you die...
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Th-That's the Master's Talisman...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The thing that Misty kept by her heart and would never take off... It wasn't the container that was important. Rather, it was the contents.
</p><p>Bikini:<br />
Th-That's...!
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
A photo?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Ah...! M... ...Mother...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's only natural for living creatures to fight to protect their own lives. But what makes us human is that we fight for others. But who do you fight for? How hard must you fight...? That's the true measure of what human life is worth. We defense attorneys are warriors who are constantly challenged by that question. Even when the battle is over, and the bonds that connect us are severed... We always return... Time and time again. Mia, Maya, Pearls, Mr. Armando... ...and Maya's mother, too... I learned that... from all of them.)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
Well... Shall we get going? Everyone is waiting.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Ah...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
This is a day to remember. A day when a lot of things were finally put to rest. I think we should celebrate what we've overcome today.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
B-But... I-I still can't...
</p><p>Bikini:<br />
...Oh, go on, sweetie. You can come back for training anytime.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Um... OK!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Alright! I'm going to make a brand new start, too! Sister Bikini! I'll be back for more training! I promise!
</p><p>Bikini:<br />
I know, and I won't go easy on you just because you're the future Master. I'll make sure to prepare reservations for three for when you come back! Wa ha ha ho ho ho hee hee hee!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Alright! We're going to have a great feast today, Pearly. You know why? Because training is a battle of endurance!
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
OK, Mystic Maya! I... I'll eat lots and lots of food tonight!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Um, you know. There's one thing I don't get... and probably don't want to, but...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
What is it, Nick?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Reservations for training is fine and all... But why for three?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Come on! What do you think? You're one of us, Nick! Next time you can train right alongside us!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Bikini:<br />
I'll be waiting for you. Sister Bikini will take special care of you!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh? Huh?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
It'll be great, Nick! We're going to do the Special Course, naturally!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh? Huh? Huh?
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
That's a great idea! After all, Mr. Nick... ...you'd do anything for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you? Even walk on hot coals, right?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
We'll have a nice, big meal before we come next time! Right, Nick!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...... ...You know... I was wondering if I can say just one little thing...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Sure! Of course you can!
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Oh, I love this part! I can't wait to hear it...!
</p><p>Bikini:<br />
I'm getting goosebumps, too!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well then... Here goes nothing...

<p>Maya:<br />
I'll really have to work extra hard now! Master of Kurain and the office manager of Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices. And I have to be a good big sister to Pearly and Nick, too! Well, as long as I'm not locked up or captured or something like that.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Pearl:<br />
So it's true! Mr. Nick really is Mystic Maya's knight in shining armor! He went through with the Special Course, all the way to the end! Actually, I heard there's a legendary, extra-special Ultra Course here, too. I think I'll surprise the two of them by making them a secret reservation...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gumshoe:<br />
Maggey bought me a brand new coat as a present, pal! I feel 10 years younger! I'll never take it off!
</p><p>Byrde:<br />
Yes, but somehow you just don't seem the same! I guess a dirty, shabby old overcoat is just more detective-like, sir.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Don't worry about it! In the name of love, a man will soil himself silly!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Andrews:<br />
Mr. Wright, I am once again in your debt. Thanks to you, the Treasures of Kurain exhibit was a great success! I even got to see Ms. von Karma, who I hadn't seen for almost a year. She taught me how to use a whip, and said that I must show you what I've learned...
</p>

<p>Ron:<br />
Dessie and I started a company called, "Mask☆DeMasque Consulting".
</p><p>Desirée:<br />
We're dedicated to stopping the evil plans of all the criminals in the city!
</p><p>Ron:<br />
Our motto is, "Cut it out, pleeeeeeeease!"
</p><p>Desirée:<br />
Pretty cute, huh!?
</p><p>Ron:<br />
Well, we also sell plans to the criminals as a kind of side-business... ...I wonder if that's OK. Sometimes I think maybe <span style="color:grey">we're the worst criminals.</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Viola:<br />
Mr. Wright... I want to thank you for... exterminating... Don Tigre... I returned the $500,000... along with a tea set. A special thick tea... One I mixed with... my own two hands... I bet he's drinking it now... Win Through Compromise... Hee... Hee... Hee...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kudo:<br />
I'm just old and in the way! A wrinkly, grumpy, clown-nosed waste of flesh! At least, that's what I thought... But my grandkids had a birthday party for me the other day. Talk about embarrassing. 69 years old and I cried like a baby with a dirty diaper!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Basil:<br />
As usual, we have an abundance of work to do. We've hired a new programmer to replace Glen Elg. I do hope everyone will get along. His name is... Adam Mada. As soon as I heard his name, I knew our brain circuits would align perfectly.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Bikini:<br />
My, my, my. More reporters? Since the murder, we've made so much money, I hardly know what to do! I think the magazines like us because I provide such a nice visual. Especially in Spring. I can hardly wait for Iris to come back. Wa ha ha ho ho ho!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Iris:<br />
...You've turned into such a respectable man, Feenie. It was so sweet of you and everyone else to come and visit me here the other day. Of course I was happy that you constantly had your eyes on me, but... ...I felt kind of bad when the little one slapped you so hard you got a nose bleed.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Oldbag:<br />
What's this!? I'm back from a long and tiring vacation and no one is here to greet me!? I guess while I was gone, my little whippersnapper buddy quit and now I've got no one! And what kind of lonely, crazy security room is this supposed to be anyway!? What with all the flashing lights and switches, I feel like some sort of space alien! And now what am I going to do with all these macadamia nuts I brought back for everyone!? If I bring them over to Edgey-poo, I know exactly what he'd say the instant he saw them. "I really can't accept these, I'm afraid," or something just as painful to this fragile heart. Oh, when will I ever find a gentleman who will treat me like a refined lady?

I finally found something I love to do! "Franzy's Whip Lash Splash" is gonna turn the art world on its head! I should have realized it sooner. Self-centered, lazy, anti-social... I'm an artist. A really good portrait artist! I'm not a loser after all!
