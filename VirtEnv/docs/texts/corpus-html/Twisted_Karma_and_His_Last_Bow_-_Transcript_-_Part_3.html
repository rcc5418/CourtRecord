<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
I still can't quite believe what just happened.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I know. I enquired with the bailiff after the court session was adjourned... ...and it seems Mr Vigil was taken to hospital to recover.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Right...
</p>
<center>Ten years ago now... ...Mr Vigil attempted to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of the prison governor's office. But ever since then...he's completely blocked the memory of those events from his mind. Nobody knew his secret. Not his family. Not even the man himself. But I...I forced it out into the open. Was it wrong of me to do that? Did I overstep the mark, I wonder...?</center>
<p><br />
???:
</p>
<center>Ruuunooo!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Iris...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You were miles away! Anyway, I've brewed a fresh pot of soothing tea for you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, thank you.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You and Susie have had an exhausting day so far, haven't you?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! ......... Thank you, Iris. How thoughtful of you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Do you happen to know where Mr Sholmes is? When we came out of the courtroom back into the defendants' antechamber, he'd disappeared.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh...no, I don't know. He just suddenly sprang to his feet and left. All he said was, 'I must leave.'
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I wonder if he's pursuing the mystery of Inspector Gregson's death...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
......... Well, you know what Hurley's always saying, don't you? 'There are mysteries in this world that should perhaps never be solved.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
'For the construction of a solution comes only at the expense of the destruction of something else...'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What does that mean...?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
He knows very well that when you open someone else's old wounds, you often open your own, too. But he just can't take his own advice and leave well alone. Solving mysteries is too important to him.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's so true.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But that's what I like about Hurley, after all!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I suppose that's the lot of a great detective in some ways...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So then... ...let's have tea and then I'll give you a hand!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Do you have time, Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, I've finished this month's manuscript at last. With barely a day to spare before the deadline!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, I'm so looking forward to it. A brand new story to read in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You know, I always hide Hurley's violin in the days before I have a deadline.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You, you do? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Poor Mr Sholmes...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm sure that's very wise, Iris. How sensible of you!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Now then, my dear fellows, let's make a plan of action before we continue our investigation!

So, how did it go in court this morning?

Well, we still don't know the truth about what really happened, but one thing's increasingly clear: Lord van Zieks definitely didn't do it.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, goodie!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, that's right. We managed to uncover several new facts as well!

And...there was another development, too. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Kazuma.)</span>

Yes, it's quite clear now... ...that Kazuma-sama is not himself. The way he's acting, it's almost as if he's...possessed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I know. I mean, at the end of the proceedings earlier... ...he was like a bloodhound the way he was chasing down Mr Vigil's forgotten past. <span style="color:#0070C0">(He's not normally so mercilessly persistent.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

If Gregson was really murdered the day before his body was discovered... ...then Lord van Zieks has to be <span style="color:#E16935">innocent</span>, you see.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What?! The day before? Well that should be easy enough to work out just by examining the corpse, surely?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, you would expect so. But curiously... ...no time of death was included in the autopsy report.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hm, that is curious.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There are still <span style="color:#E16935">unanswered questions</span> about Lord van Zieks, though, aren't there?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah, do you mean...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I mean what was he doing there on Fresno Street that day in the first place?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well according to the man's testimony... ...he said he was <span style="color:#E16935">investigating</span> Inspector Gregson, didn't he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And it turns out that little room was actually the inspector's <span style="color:#E16935">secret office</span>...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ooh, that sounds like it has all the makings of a wonderfully devilish plot!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But then why was that noticeboard in there covered in all those particular papers? Papers about cases with a link to the Reaper. ...I'm starting to get a bad feeling about all this.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh dear... That sounds more like something horribly devilish...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We must start by looking into Inspector Gregson's movements of late!

I never imagined I might have to be investigating an inspector's movements.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, according to the entry in his diary... ...he was carrying out an incognito investigation of the Red-Headed League the day before his death.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh! You, you mean he was doing the same as Hurley?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...Mr Sholmes was trying to <span style="color:#E16935">apply</span>, whereas the inspector was supposed to be <span style="color:#E16935">investigating</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I do wish it had been the other way around...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Anyway, as it turns out, the inspector who went to investigate the Red-Headed League that day... ...wasn't actually Gregson at all. It was Mr Vigil, in possession of Gregson's identification.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hm, you know what that sounds like to me? <span style="color:#E16935">Establishing an alibi</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my! Yes, you're absolutely right, Iris!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...why would Gregson need an alibi?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It would appear that the inspector... ...had something to do that he wished to keep <span style="color:#E16935">secret</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I don't believe it... I, I always thought he was just a harmless <span style="color:#E16935">lover of fish and chips</span>...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But perhaps they were <span style="color:#E16935">seasoned</span> with something a little more potent than salt and vinegar...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I think perhaps...we should try to move away from food analogies?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Well anyway, if Lord van Zieks felt the need to investigate Gregson...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, I agree. We must try to find out what he knows.

Vigil, you say? Isn't that the name of the lady who came to visit Hurley yesterday?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's right. To ask Mr Sholmes if he would help her to find her missing husband.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Only Mr Sholmes completely passed the buck to us. ...Actually, didn't you say that Mr Vigil had been taken to hospital? Do you know which one?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah, it's St Synner's.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I'm starting to wonder if all the other hospitals in London have closed down...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But that's amazing, Runo! You've found the lady's husband already!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...I suppose I have. By accident.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And ten years ago, while Mr Vigil was the chief warder at the prison... ...he was responsible for overseeing the Professor's incarceration.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
No!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So when the convict escaped, he was held responsible and immediately dismissed.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ugh...sometimes I really don't want to grow up.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There's more. For ten years after that... ...while he was ostensibly working as a pedlar, he also had another <span style="color:#E16935">secret job</span>. He was paid by Gregson to be his <span style="color:#E16935">stand-in</span>. To impersonate the inspector.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
To impersonate Gregsy?! But, but why?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I have absolutely no idea.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ugh...Ginny was right. I'm starting to think all adults are up to no good now. Including you, Runo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I haven't paid anyone to impersonate me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That means he has ties to the Professor and to Inspector Gregson, though. So I do think we ought to pay a visit to Mr Vigil, don't you?

No arguments, Prosecutor Asogi. You will continue with the trial exactly as I instructed. Is that clear?

Oh! Um...well, erm...I was just hoping to ask you a few questions, if you wouldn't mind.

I wanted van Zieks's trial concluded today. But Prosecutor Asogi's unwelcome inquiries are going to make it take longer than necessary.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Unwelcome inquiries...?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
As a result, I'm losing even more precious time. Currently two hours, fifty-five minutes and forty-one seconds. ...Forty-two...forty-three...

Then we must resolve everything before three hours have passed, Mr Naruhodo!

Does Prosecutor Asogi believe...that Lord van Zieks is the Reaper?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I wouldn't know. It was ten years ago, in that fateful closed trial, that Lord van Zieks made a name for himself among the judiciary. But the next trial he fought, he lost. It meant the ringleader of a criminal organisation was acquitted...thanks to all the jurors being <span style="color:#E16935">under duress</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But that's awful!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The man's freedom was short-lived. He lasted just three days.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, let me see...he died in a rockslide at his place of work, I believe!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Correct. That was the inauguration of the Reaper of the Bailey.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And people believed Lord van Zieks was responsible?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
He was brought to trial himself. ...But it was shown to have been an accident.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So he must have had a solid <span style="color:#E16935">alibi</span> then.)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Nevertheless, the mysterious deaths continued. In total, sixteen persons perished in unusual circumstances, ostensibly at the hand of the Reaper. ...That's a long run of coincidences.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, the Reaper's true identity may well be revealed by this trial.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
And the impact that revelation would have on the British public cannot be understated.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Is that why it's a closed trial?

Precisely.

Correct.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Actually, we heard that originally... ...you were going to prosecute that trial yourself, Lord Stronghart.

Van Zieks entreated me to relinquish the prosecution to him. That he might avenge his brother's death. And here we are, ten years later... ...with the son of the man van Zieks had condemned now looking to avenge his father's death in the same way.

As I said, the Reaper of the Bailey is no single person. It's a highly secret organisation with close ties to Scotland Yard. But there's no doubt that Gregson was <span style="color:#E16935">a key member</span> of that organisation.

Oh!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
He was <span style="color:#E16935">the tactician</span>. His job was to covertly investigate the marks and plot their assassinations. In order to do that without arousing suspicion, he regularly needed a firm <span style="color:#E16935">alibi</span>.

Vigil knows nothing of the Reaper. But the room he rents on Fresno Street was almost certainly <span style="color:#E16935">the headquarters</span> of the operation. Gregson would have met the assassin there for briefings.

Oh! Well...thank you very much. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Although I'm fairly sure you omitted '<span style="color:#E16935">by Kazuma</span>' on the end there.)</span>
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
No no no, please don't misunderstand! It was you who impressed me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Really?!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
You didn't miss a step against Asogi. And we all know how capable he is. Really, to have matured into such a fine defence lawyer in less than a year is quite extraordinary.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's...very kind of you to say so. <span style="color:#0070C0">(And really nice to hear.)</span>
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
What I saw in court today confirmed what I'd been hoping for. The favour I mentioned yesterday, Naruhodo. I trust you haven't forgotten?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! No, you...you did mention something, didn't you?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But first! We have something to report, Father.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Of course, of course. Shall we take tea while we discuss matters further?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hm... ...I wonder where Judge Jigoku has got to.)</span>

Father, do you know about the so-called Reaper of the Bailey?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I've heard rumours. Some members of the judiciary explained it all to me yesterday. Of course, when I was a visitng student here in London, the Reaper was yet to emerge.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Right, he didn't appear until <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> that case when the visiting students had already returned home.)</span>
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Lord van Zieks who was in the dock today... That was Barok, <span style="color:#E16935">the younger brother</span> of Klint van Zieks, I believe.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's right. And he's known throughout London as the Reaper, as you've heard. But the truth is... ...it wasn't him behind all of those mysterious deaths. It was <span style="color:#E16935">somebody else</span>!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I see... So what you're saying is, there's been <span style="color:#E16935">a professional killer</span> at work here?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Exactly. Someone by the name of Asa Shinn, in fact.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
...I beg your pardon? Did, did you say...Asa Shinn?! You mean that Jezaille Brett woman who was responsible for killing my great friend?!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh no! A friend of yours was killed?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! Um...Professor Mikotoba, I think perhaps we shouldn't discuss this right now...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

So that young girl... ...is called Iris Wilson, is she?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, that's right.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
And she's the author of all those adventure stories starring the great detective Sholmes? But the name of the credited <span style="color:#E16935">author</span> isn't Iris, is it? It's Dr John H. Wilson.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I know. That's the name of her <span style="color:#E16935">father</span>, you see.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Her father? Dr John H. Wilson... I was deeply indebted to the man for all the kindness he showed me during my time in London. That's why I was keen to reciprocate and invite him to the Imperial Yumei University four years ago. .........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But he was murdered last year...by Jezaille Brett. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Why? Why would the hand of the Reaper stretch all the way to Japan?)</span> Iris knows nothing about that case. But it seems very likely that the victim, Dr Wilson, was her father.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well...I can't say that we ever spoke about his family. So I don't know if he had a daughter or not. But I think I can say with some certainty...that he was never the great detective's partner.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...it could have been another Dr Wilson, you think?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well...John and Wilson are both common names, after all. Still, it's probably best not to mention this to the young lady until we can be sure.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That's what we thought, yes.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
We're back! With cinnamon biscuits!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ooh! They smell delicious, Iris!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I think cinnamon will go very well with the tea they serve here. Don't you, Susie?

F-Father! What's the meaning of this?

Now, Susato, you should understand. You've seen how our courts work firsthand. Japan's judicial system is in its infancy. Especially when it comes to defence.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! You mean...?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
The Supreme Court of Judicature is in desperate need of <span style="color:#E16935">a good defence lawyer</span>. As soon as possible. Really quite urgently, in fact.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
B-But...I've not even been in London a year yet!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I've read all of Susato's reports. I'm well aware of your extraordinary talents. And having seen you in action with my own eyes earlier today, there's no question: You, Naruhodo, are precisely <span style="color:#E16935">the man our country needs</span>.

Please, the pair of you... Don't look so downcast. It's merely a suggestion, you understand. A hope, if I'm honest. But I won't force you. All I ask is that you consider it, and come to a decision by the time this trial concludes.

I, I will, but...what is it?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
No questions at this time, if you please, Miss Susato. All we can do is pray... ...that for once my deduction is awry.

Doesn't that imply that your deductions are normally correct, Mr Sholmes? Which isn't exactly-

Keeping it from Evie - my wife - all these years... I've carried such a sense of guilt. But that's not the worst of it. Over time...I obviously came to deceive myself as well.

You mean...about your dismissal?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Looking back now... ...I'm beginning to think that perhaps Inspector Gregson didn't stumble across me by accident at all. I mean, he compensated me so generously for acting as his stand-in. He was clearly concerned for my wellbeing and... doing what he could to help.

I would think so. And until Mr Vigil is a little more stable... ...it's probably just as well that he has a kindly person in the neighbouring bed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The 'endlessly' part is a little worrying though, isn't it? I mean, what if Mr Vigil suddenly declared that he'd like to take a trip out of the window? Would this endlessly obliging patient simply open it for him and say, 'Be my guest'?

Inspector Gregson was obviously engaged in <span style="color:#E16935">a special operation</span> of some sort. He was investigating something that even Scotland Yard couldn't know about.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Details of the Reaper's <span style="color:#E16935">marks</span>, yes...)</span>
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
It was when he had to carry out those investigations that I would take his identification and impersonate him.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You'd pretend to be the inspector and carry out investigations on his behalf?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Oh no! Never! A common street pedlar couldn't possibly carry out a proper police investigation! All I would do is go to the specified location and make a little <span style="color:#E16935">hoo-ha</span>. Just something to <span style="color:#E16935">leave an impression</span>. So everyone there would think, 'A detective called Gregson was here.'
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So...that's what you were doing on the day prior to the incident?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Yes. He asked me to make an appearance at the park on Lime Street for the Red-Headed League event. So as usual, I flashed the inspector's identification around and was very vocal about my presence.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But then you were taken prisoner! By those red-headed fraudsters.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Yes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...you would always make a point of showing Gregson's identification and generally being loud?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
That's what the inspector asked me to do, yes.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well that's one way of becoming <span style="color:#E16935">a legendary detective</span>, I suppose. ...Not a good one, though.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
And as you know, I suffered this bruising around my neck at their hands. But the following day they kept their word and released me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Without returning the inspector's identification to you, however.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
We had arranged to meet in the Fresno Street room at five that day so I could report back to the inspector. But at the agreed time, that's when I heard the gunshot.

It was at midnight on 17th June ten years ago. That was the time scheduled for the execution.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But the Professor's execution <span style="color:#E16935">never actually took place</span>, did it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Or rather, the execution itself must have been used to effect <span style="color:#E16935">the plan of escape</span>. I hardly dare to imagine what a chilling plan it was...
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Barclay was renowned for being the highest security prison in the country. Everything that went in or out of the place was searched multiple times. But...there was one notable <span style="color:#E16935">exception</span>. Or rather, one notable <span style="color:#E16935">loophole</span>. Something that was never questioned.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I have a feeling I know what that <span style="color:#E16935">loophole</span> was now. <span style="color:#E16935">The coffins</span> into which the bodies of the executed convicts were placed, correct?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
...Yes. Once the coroner had confirmed the death of a condemned convict... ...the body was taken in its coffin for immediate burial in Lowgate Cemetery just behind the prison. The chief warder first had to sign the necessary papers. And after that no member of staff was permitted to touch the coffin containing the body again.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...!
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
When executions took place, only the executioner and the coroner were permitted inside the chamber. I would wait in the adjacent room for word that the condemned convict was dead. On that occasion, once I had that confirmation, I went into the mortuary to find a lone coffin, as usual. The procedure was that I would sign the paperwork having checked the coffin, then nail it shut. But for some reason that day, the coffin was <span style="color:#E16935">already nailed shut</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No!
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
I didn't think anything of it at the time. I assumed that my deputy must have checked the coffin and nailed it shut before I arrived.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...you mean...?! The coffin contained...
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Yes. I can only imagine that Asogi, having escaped his execution somehow, was <span style="color:#E16935">alive inside the coffin</span>. The coffin was then taken out through the main gates and deposited in Lowgate Cemetery.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Presumably there wouldn't have been enough air inside to breathe for long.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So in the early hours following the burial, somebody <span style="color:#E16935">dug up</span> the coffin again to set Genshin free.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But in the end... ...he was fatally shot in the graveyard anyway. What on earth really happened in Lowgate Cemetery that night, I wonder?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
I'm afraid I really don't know. All I can say with certainty are two things: Asogi couldn't possibly have escaped that way without help from somebody working in the prison. And that somebody...was not me.

</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Yes. I remember him well, in fact.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Would you mind...telling us what you know?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Well, having been condemned to death as he was, any contact I had with the man was short, obviously. After that trial, which was carried out behind closed doors, attended only by elite members of the judiciary... ...they called for his execution to be carried out at the earliest possible opportunity.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The outcome of the trial was set from the beginning, wasn't it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It was a time of delicate diplomacy, when Britain and Japan were in the process of signing an important treaty. That meant that this potentially destabilising case had to be dealt with swiftly and discreetly.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
The man had less than a week in total. As I was the chief warder, I oversaw his short stay in the cells until his final hour. I remember being struck deeply by his noble character and incredible resilience.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean exactly?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
He was a killer of many men, but he was always quiet and polite. He was a gentleman, and a man of intellect. In fact, I couldn't bring myself to believe what he'd done, so I asked him one day.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Vigil:<br />
Those five members of the aristocracy whose lives were taken... Were you really responsible?
</p><p>...I'm guilty of the unforgivable crime of ending another human's life, yes.

<p>Vigil:<br />
The following day, the closed trial took place. And the verdict was no surprise.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Guilty.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
That night, when he was brought back to his cell... ...I saw something. Something...<span style="color:#E16935">unusual</span>.

As I said, it was on the night following his trial, after he'd been found guilty. I was doing the rounds of the cells, and when I looked into Asogi's... ...I noticed that he seemed to have <span style="color:#E16935">a sheet of paper</span> in his hand.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah... <span style="color:#0070C0">(His <span style="color:#E16935">last will and testament</span> then, presumably.)</span>
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
As soon as he noticed me, he hurriedly shoved it behind his back.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But...why did you find that so unusual? Isn't it normal for a man to pen a will when he knows his death is nigh?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Yes, that's true. But there were <span style="color:#E16935">special conditions</span> to Asogi's incarceration, you see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What sort of conditions?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Well...even though he was held in a cell designed for condemned inmates... ...he was allowed to keep his personal effects with him, with <span style="color:#E16935">one exception</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Really? He was allowed <span style="color:#E16935">his things</span>? <span style="color:#0070C0">(That is unusual, certainly.)</span>
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Of course, he'd been convicted of killing five members of the aristocracy... ...but at the same time he was <span style="color:#E16935">a guest</span> in our country from the Empire of Japan. The powers that be were determined that his final days shouldn't be needlessly uncomfortable.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And what was the exception you mentioned...to the personal effects he was allowed?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
That's the point. He wasn't permitted to have <span style="color:#E16935">writing utensils</span>. Specifically, no pens or paper.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So...he was prevented from leaving any <span style="color:#E16935">written record</span> of what had happened to him?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Yes, that was the long and the short of it. I've no idea where he obtained that paper. Any writing materials would have been confiscated from him upon his incarceration. As I said, he hid the paper behind his back and then he pleaded with me:
</p>
<hr />
<p>Vigil:<br />
What did you just hide behind your back?
</p><p>Please... Please, turn a blind eye. This...is my lifeline.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
But...you know it's <span style="color:#E16935">against the rules</span>.
</p><p>You're the only person who's seen. If you just agree to keep quiet...
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Alright then. But what's on that paper?
</p><p>...A last will and testament. This will...is the only weapon I have left now.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(How can a will be a weapon?)</span>
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
So I decided to pretend I'd seen nothing. And I let him keep his will. But then later... ...it just seemed to <span style="color:#E16935">vanish</span> without trace.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! What do you mean, it vanished?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It would seem that isn't the end of the story of this mysterious will.

To poor Kazuma-sama...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And you're saying that it wasn't anywhere to be found among his personal effects? The will, I mean.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
That's right. Though I didn't search through them myself. But Governor Caidin was livid. He was screaming, 'It cannae have disappeared completely!'
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That...doesn't quite make sense though, does it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In what way?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, we'd understood that <span style="color:#E16935">only Mr Vigil</span> was aware of the will's existence. In which case, how did the prison governor know to look for it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh yes! You're right!
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
I really don't know how he knew. But it certainly seemed as though he knew of the will's existence from the outset. Only he didn't refer to it as a will. What he said was... ...the '<span style="color:#E16935">Asogi Papers</span>'.

That murderer's botched execution... And the whole miserable escape... They were Barclay's darkest hour, aye. A shocking embarrassment.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Because the convict had <span style="color:#E16935">a collaborator</span> on the prison staff, you mean?
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
...Aye, for shame. The coroner who confirmed the death o' the man after his execution, Courtney Sithe. And my chief warder at the time, Vigil, who was in charge o' the whole affair.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But Mr Vigil says he didn't know anything about it.
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
The rascal would'nae say otherwise, eh? ...More handcuffs?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh! How could I say no? ...You can never have too much iron in your diet!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
When Mr Vigil was handed his dismissal notice as a result of what had happened... ...he was so despairing, he jumped out of your office window, didn't he?
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
I dinnae like to say, but that's just Vigil trying to get oot of it. Do you no think he would'nae have jumped from the shock of his crimes being exposed, eh? ...I do.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You would'nae say otherwise though, would you?)</span>
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Of course, I cannae shun all responsibility myself. I should'nae have let him deceive me. Actually, there's barely anybody that kens what went on at the time now. Wi' Gregson having been murdered, and Dr Sithe forbidden from having any visitors.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(No visitors? Someone obviously doesn't want her giving anything away...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well...we're not going home empty-handed!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
And I would'nae dream of sending you packing wi' nowt, kimmer. Here...take a handcuff or two!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh! Well it would be rude to say no! ...Wouldn't want to become anaemic!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
I suppose...if there's anybody who might still ken aboot what happened back then... ...it'd be that lass from the forensic division. Maria Gorey.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Maria...Gorey?
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Aye, Sithe's daughter. She did'nae have no more. Just the one. But the wee bairn's followed in her mam's footsteps. You dinnae ever see her wi'out a scalpel in her hand.

So...she's Dr Sithe's daughter, but her surname is Gorey?

Aye, there's some family history, I'm sure, but I dinnae ken the ins and oots of it. She grew up watching her mam working wi' the bodies of folk who'd died in strange circumstances... ...and decided to do the same wi' her own life. I cannae understand it myself.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Perhaps she was driven by a deep respect for her mother...
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Perhaps... Anyhoo, she was in charge of Gregson's <span style="color:#E16935">autopsy</span>, I believe.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Right. And the coroner responsible for this <span style="color:#E16935">incomplete report</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Someone told me once that the wee lassie always loved her mam's stories aboot cutting up bodies. There's even a rumour that she used to listen to the funeral march as a lullaby.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well then perhaps...her mother might have told her about the autopsy from the case ten years ago!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Aye, I'd say there's a fighting chance at least. After all, that was <span style="color:#E16935">a life-changing case</span> for all of us.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(We really need to speak to Miss Gorey herself about this, I think.)</span> Well...thank you very much.

I'm no happy aboot any part o' this. It took years for Londoners to finally forget the whole Professor business. Can you no gi' up on this, laddie? Stop asking pointless questions.

It's getting on for a year now. Since what happened on the SS Burya. <span style="color:#0070C0">(We were heading across the oceans from Japan to Great Britain... ...when a bizarre serious <i>[sic]</i> of coincidences led to those tragic events.)</span> I thought...I'd lost my best friend forever.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...I must have been unconscious for a long time. When I awoke, I was lying on a bed. It was a narrow little room. There was a posy of flowers by the pillow. It took me a little while to realise that I was in the cabin of a ship. I slipped out of the room and headed up onto the deck.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Were you already suffering from amnesia at that point?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes. I didn't know what had happened or where I was. There was just this voice in my head.
</p>
<hr />
<p>You have something you have to do. Something no one else can know about. Go to Great Britain. Your task awaits you there...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
It was a calling I couldn't ignore. It compelled me relentlessly. Out on deck, I saw that I was on a huge steamship and we were docked in a large port.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It must have been Hong Kong!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, it must have been. Presumably just before they were due to carry your 'body' off the ship.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I had no idea of the situation. But I did have the feeling that this was in some way my last chance. So I concealed myself among the disembarking passengers and went ashore. Then I disappeared into the crowded streets of that foreign port city... ...so I could plan my onward journey to Great Britain.

<p>Kazuma:<br />
Just under a year ago, with all my past memories lost to me, I was left behind in Hong Kong. Everything was foreign to me. The sights, the sounds, the smells. My head reeled. I was truly at a loss. I realise now that I'd escaped as a dead man. With nothing but the clothes on my back. No money, of course.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, how terrifying for you...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Luckily though, I had two feathers in my cap.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
One being your <span style="color:#E16935">knowledge of English</span>, I suppose?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
That's right. And on the back of that, I was able to pick up some work as a deck hand on a cargo ship. Eventually, after calling at countless ports, I finally arrived at Dover. That must have been some three months ago now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Your formidable tenacity of purpose showing itself again. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I mean, the man had lost his memory and had literally nothing to his name... ...but he still managed to make his way to London on the opposite side of the world.)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Of course, I had no idea why I'd moved heaven and earth to get here at that point.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...how did you end up becoming Lord van Zieks's apprentice, then?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
That...can only be called an extraordinary <span style="color:#E16935">stroke of luck</span> really. You see, I was stopped at the border because I had no papers. They took me straight to Scotland Yard. And by sheer coincidence, Lord Stronghart was there to attend a meeting. That's when the second feather in my cap came into play.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Would that have been your <span style="color:#E16935">knowledge of the law</span>?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes, exactly. Lord Stronghart was curious about an Easterner with intimate knowledge of British law. He took me back with him to the Supreme Court and assigned me to the Prosecutor's Office.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And then, nine days ago... ...you finally got your memory back after the trial involving Drebber.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes...I did.

Mark my words, Ryunosuke. I'll be chosen as a visiting student, and make my way to Great Britain someday.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Did you know the entire time? About what happened to your father here?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... Sixteen years ago... ...when my father left on that exciting trip to Great Britain, I was just a boy. We took a photograph together the day before his departure. ...It's my last memory of him. But what I remember most about my father...is his unswerving sense of justice. Six years after he left, a gentleman called at our family home. He told me that Genshin - my father - had been taken ill in England and passed away. It was Professor Mikotoba. Your father, Susato-san.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ever since then, the professor was very good to me. He even helped to fund my university education at Yumei. I'll be forever in his debt. But nevertheless...I just couldn't bring myself to believe what he'd told me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Then one day, a letter arrived at our house from Britain. There was no indication of the sender, so I opened it assuming it was from an old acquaintance of my father. ......... What I read in that letter changed my entire life.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What did it say?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It said that my father had been <span style="color:#E16935">a mass murderer</span>, and the writer cursed the Asogi name.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh no!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
As a result of that letter, I found out what had been hidden from me all those years.

Presumably the letter was sent from a relative of one of the victims. If whoever it was had been a member of the judiciary, he could have been present at the closed trial. The letter revealed that my father had been sentenced to death. Executed for being a killer.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm, I'm so sorry you had to find out that way...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I imagine the British government did its very best to silence whoever sent that letter. But someone who knew the truth and couldn't bear the resentment was always going to be a problem.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But still! It, it could have been written by anyone. Why would you believe such a thing?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
There was a newspaper cutting included with the letter. It was the first I'd ever heard of the Professor and his terrible killing spree.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well...what did my father have to say about the letter?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...I couldn't bring myself to show it to him.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? Why not?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Because he'd deliberately concealed the truth from me by telling me my father was taken by a fatal illness. That couldn't have been easy for him. And he'd done it out of consideration for my feelings. So instead...I showed the letter to Judge Jigoku.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, to the other visiting student...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
He faltered for the briefest of moments, but then he just laughed the letter off. But in that moment, I saw it on his face. He was undeniably shocked. Shaken momentarily, before recovering his poise.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
A year later, my bereaved mother succumbed to the strain of grief, and she too passed away. That's when I made up my mind. That one day...without fail... ...I would cross the seas to Britain and seek the truth for myself. The truth about my father, Genshin Asogi. And I wouldn't let anyone stand in my way!

Oh, Kazuma-sama...

What we learnt today in court turned things completely on their head. It was an impressive piece of lawyering...Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Lord van Zieks isn't the Reaper, you know. I almost don't want to believe it myself, but it turns out that Inspector Gregson himself, the victim, was...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It's clear that the inspector was behind the Reaper's activity all along.

Wha...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(You mean, <span style="color:#E16935">you knew</span>?!)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The real question is, who's been <span style="color:#E16935">giving orders</span> to the inspector? ......... Yes, Barok van Zieks is the real Reaper.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And I know that ten years ago, it was him... ...who decided my father must be a mass murderer and sent him to his grave!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No! He was merely seeing that justice was done as the law dictates. He's not to blame.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ultimately, it's people who condemn people. The law is just a tool that they use to do it.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And when a man condemns another, he must take responsibility for his actions. Of course he must. But I know for certain...that my father would never have taken another man's life.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Kazuma...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
On the contrary, my father's life was taken... by the Reaper!

This came up in the trial, didn't it? As something a little dubious, I mean. The fact that <span style="color:#E16935">no time of death</span> was recorded on Inspector Gregson's autopsy report.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes, there were some unexpected turns in the courtroom earlier. The suggestion you came up with certainly took everyone by surprise. The idea that the victim died the previous day <span style="color:#E16935">at some other location</span> is quite something.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, considering when the pocket watch had stopped and the scorch marks on the candle... ...it's certainly a distinct possibility. The evidence and the scene both point to it.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... To be honest, it bothered me too. So I paid a visit to the autopsy room earlier. The coroner responsible wasn't there, but I got a name. It's Dr Gorey.

Ryunosuke... I...want to thank you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What for?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
For this. You safeguarded the soul of the Asogi clan.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, it is a famous sword that's been in your family for generations. My only slight regret is that I never got the chance to draw it before I returned it to you.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Karuma is said to have been forged by a master swordsmith during the Sengoku warring states period. I come from a long lineage of warriors, many of whom were expert swordsmen.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Well then, you're a chip off the old block, I'd say.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
This blade - Karuma - is the symbol of the Asogi clan's honour and might. Apparently, one of my father's apprentices even took the blade's name for a surname.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Really? Karuma... It does sound formidable, that's for sure.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Sixteen years ago, when my father was a visiting student here in London, he had this sword forever at his side. Which is why it means so much to me that I have it by my side again now too. And that...is all thanks to you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

No, Ryunosuke, I haven't changed at all. It's you who's changed.

...Unrelated? Is that you want to say? How can you be so sure?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?

...Never mind. That man is the Reaper. And it's for that reason that the inspector was killed. I'm going to prove as much in court tomorrow... by whatever means necessary!

I can't let you do that, Kazuma.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... I know you'll do what you have to as a lawyer. But I'm sure I don't need to tell you that I won't be taking any prisoners in the courtroom.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I would expect nothing less.

Until tomorrow then...in the Old Bailey.

Mama always says that operations and dissections require speed and accuracy. So I take out my needle and thread and stitch three new dolls every day.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...right...

So...why doesn't this autopsy report include the victim's time of death then? It's really the most crucial detail.
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
I was told not to write it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! By whom?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
Mael Stronghart. The Lord Chief Justice. He came here.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Lord Stronghart came...?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
He said that from the witness statements about the gunshot and the other evidence, it was obvious. The man clearly died at 5 p.m. on 1st November, when the gunshot was heard.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But that's not the time of death you wrote on the report. You didn't write anything. Was there...some <span style="color:#E16935">reason you didn't include it</span>?!

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean by that? Why was the time of death <span style="color:#E16935">indeterminate</span>?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
When the specimen was brought in, it was still fresh. So the time of death could easily have coincided with when the gunshot was heard. But...there was one small discrepancy.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What <span style="color:#E16935">discrepancy</span>?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
There was some fried fish in the pocket of the specimen's overcoat. And that fish...had started to rot.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
If the victim liked fried fish, he presumably liked to eat it before it went off.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...yes. What are you really trying to say?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
It's possible that someone tried to <span style="color:#E16935">manipulate</span> the apparent time of death.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Manipulate the...? Is that even possible to do?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
Theoretically, if you were to chill the body in ice, you could <span style="color:#E16935">delay</span> the onset of putrefaction. And if the overcoat <span style="color:#E16935">wasn't on the body</span> at the time...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Then only the fish would have started to rot!
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
With today's science, it's not yet possible to determine if the body was chilled or not.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(But today's science is advanced enough to let you freeze a corpse, it seems...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But surely... ...to chill a corpse like that would require an enormous <span style="color:#E16935">electrical refrigerator</span>. And I don't imagine many households in London are equipped with such a device.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
No, definitely not. But maybe in a factory? Or some other special places?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I don't recall seeing any factories or suchlike on Fresno Street, though. I wonder...if the inspector's body had been chilled somehow... ...what might the actual time of death have been?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
I couldn't say for sure. But at the most, it might have been a day earlier.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
In other words, it would <span style="color:#E16935">corroborate</span> your previous deduction, Mr Naruhodo. That Inspector Gregson was killed a day before his body was discovered, at <span style="color:#E16935">a different location</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Did you inform Lord Stronghart of this possibility?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
He simply said that there were no electrical refrigerators of that size in the vicinity.

Excuse me, sir! I do apologise for troubling you whilst you're singing so merrily, but... ...would you be kind enough to explain the situation?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Well that worked.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
A crooning gentleman and a mute young girl... A rather tantalising juxtaposition. And one that appears to have incited the gods of deduction within me to find their voices, too.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah! Mr Sholmes! Do you mean...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The strains of reasoning within me are playing now as a delightful duet. One melody sings of <span style="color:#E16935">a reunion</span> full of nostalgia.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Whilst the other... ...is a morose theme about <span style="color:#E16935">the great secret</span> you're trying so desperately to conceal, Iris.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She's turned as white as a sheet.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So as usual, you've instantly seen to the very heart of the matter!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And by the time my own brief performance is over, I feel sure this gentleman's song will reach its finale. So then...to music-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony! Pray, do enjoy Herlock Sholmes's latest 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!

<center><b>The Great Deduction</b><br />
The game is afoot!</center>
<p><br />
<b>Topic 1</b><br />
Man's Identity
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Firstly, we consider the gentleman's nationality. Clearly he's <span style="color:#E16935">a German</span> with no grasp of the English language... ...as evidenced by the Germanic song he sings and his apparent inability to understand when asked to desist. So...why is the man here at all, and in such apparently high spirits? The answer of course, Iris...is clearly known to you. Indeed, we need only follow the gaze of those bright, young eyes to unravel that particular part of this mystery.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The reason for the man's mildly irritating warbling is revealed by the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>herbal tea</b></span>! You obviously offered our German guest a cup of your latest herbal blend. The tea's delectable flavour has made the man's spirits soar... ...and resulted in this joyful ditty tumbling incessantly from his lips. I eagerly await sampling the flavour myself, that I may join the fellow in his state of elation.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Nnnnnn...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now to the next question: <span style="color:#E16935">Who</span> exactly is this gentleman availing himself so thoroughly of the settee?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As it happens, a number of years ago now... ...a certain gentleman of German origin engaged my services in solving a particularly delicate case. He required the retrieval of letters once sent to an acquaintance, that might have proved...problematic. In order to conceal his noble identity, he also arrived at my office in a mask. The gentleman's name was Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein... ...the King of Germany.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
If my memory serves...the mask worn by this gentleman is identical. Yes, there can be no question! That mask belongs to <span style="color:#E16935"><b>the King of Germany</b></span>! It would appear that His Majesty remembers the fine service I afforded him... ...and has decided to show his face again, mask and all, in order to express his gratitude. A well-mannered monarch indeed. Wouldn't you agree, my dear fellow? So the identity of this masked visitor is in fact my former client...the King of Germany! Indeed, his son is currently in London as well, enjoying the wonders of the Great Exhibition.
</p><p><b>Topic 1</b><br />
Man's Identity
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
The King of Germany
</p><p><br />
<b>Topic 2</b><br />
Girl's Silence
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Which leaves us with one remaining imponderable. Yes...you, young Iris.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But your apparently inexplicable silence...is unable to hide the truth.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, the reason for your muteness is concealed inside that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>knapsack</b></span>! A five pound note, I believe. I must say, as your compatriot, I'm deeply saddened. It would appear that you've allowed yourself to be bribed into silence by His Royal Highness. Earning yourself some spending money in exchange for keeping quiet about the King's secret.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Nnn...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And now, the final piece of the puzzle... What is this <span style="color:#E16935">secret</span> you strive to hide with your silence, Iris? Ah, yes! We need only follow that brief, involuntary twitch of your eyes to find the answer. You were attempting to abscond with that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>coffee cup</b></span>! My <span style="color:#E16935">favourite</span> coffee cup, in fact. Or should I say, <span style="color:#E16935">the handle</span> of my favourite coffee cup? It appears that His High-Spirited Highness broke it in the midst of his high jinks.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Nnn...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Which leads us to the sad truth... My favourite coffee cup has been broken by the King of Germany - and Iris, you tried to conceal it from me! ...I shall have a bill sent via governmental channels to the German royal family for its replacement.
</p><p><b>Topic 2</b><br />
Girl's Silence
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
To hide the coffee cup
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction... of this painful puzzle...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
With your silence as well, the fellow's jovial warbling rather rings in the ears, does it not?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Haah...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Um, Mr Sholmes... ...I must say something does rather trouble me.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Pray, Miss Susato, do tell.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
His Royal Highness... ...doesn't appear to have moved a muscle since we arrived.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And you haven't said a word, either, Iris.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If Mr Sholmes has it all right, you might as well own up to it now.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...Your reasoning isn't entirely without substance, I must admit.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And...one other thing, Mr Sholmes.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yet another grievance, Mr Naruhodo? Surely not.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, I actually read the story of that case recently. The one you were just describing. And according to that at least, it wasn't the King of <span style="color:#E16935">Germany</span>, it was the King of <span style="color:#E16935">Bohemia</span>.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... Goodness, was it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, that's quite true. Master Gotts, the prince, testified to that in court. In his words, 'I have come to see the Great Exhibition all the way from my home in Bohemia.'
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... I would ask you to keep that minor error to yourselves. ...It could easily become quite a scandal.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I believe, Mr Naruhodo... ...that it's our turn now to make some corrections to a number of minor errors that may have slipped in.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, even Mr Sholmes is willing to admit he might be slightly wide of the mark this time. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Although it's clear that Iris is definitely hiding something. We need to find out <span style="color:#E16935">the truth</span> behind this mysterious scene!)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But one truth is incontrovertible. My favourite coffee cup is no more... So...shall we embark again... ...on a joint presentation of Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'?
</p>
<hr />
<center><b>Course Correction</b><br />
Hold it, Mr Sholmes!</center>
<p><br />
<b>Topic 1</b><br />
Man's Identity
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
The King of Germany
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Firstly, we consider the gentleman's nationality. Clearly he's <span style="color:#E16935">a German</span> with no grasp of the English language... ...as evidenced by the Germanic song he sings and his apparent inability to understand when asked to desist.

</p><p>Iris:<br />

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The reason for the man's mildly irritating warbling is revealed by the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>herbal tea</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So what, it's some mix of herbs that gives you the urge to sing?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Goodness... I should like to try some.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And I'd like to hear your singing, but this man... Just how long does he intend to keep up with that tune, do you suppose?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
As I said, he's been stock-still the entire time. And if you look closely... ...his lips aren't moving either.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So I'm not sure what's actually responsible for the spirited singing. But I suspect the answer lies at the end of Iris's gaze.

Iris's special blends are quite delicious, I agree. They always make my heart sing. So I can understand wanting to vocalise those feelings, certainly. In fact, Mr Naruhodo, you often erupt in boisterous laughter after drinking Iris's tea.

I've encountered somebody else whose behaviour became very strange indeed whilst wearing this. Because this particular mask...has some curious power to corrupt people's minds! Which is exactly what's happened to this gentleman!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Then I would say this calls for a demonstration, my dear fellow.

I'm afraid, Miss Susato, you must be mista-
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No! ...I think not, Mr Sholmes.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Then it would appear our logic and reasoning has once again revealed the truth. This mysterious visitor...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Is my unconscious father...<span style="color:#E16935">Yujin Mikotoba</span>!

To hide the coffee cup
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Which leaves us with one remaining imponderable. Yes...you, young Iris.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But your apparently inexplicable silence...is unable to hide the truth.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, the reason for your muteness is concealed inside that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>knapsack</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So that's a five pound note poking out from Iris's knapsack, is it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear, I can't be sure. Most money that we encounter is in coin form.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I know. I'm not even sure if we've seen any banknotes here in Britain at all, have we?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But anyway! Father would never have paid money for Iris's silence!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...He certainly seems like the silent type himself, though, judging by his present state. <span style="color:#0070C0">(There must be some other reason for Iris's silence, I suppose.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Perhaps what Iris is trying so hard not to give away with her eyes... ...is something entirely different!

Obviously the real reason for Iris's silence now is given away by this Persian slipper! The truth is, even though it's a famous item from one of your most famous mysteries, Mr Sholmes... ...Iris hasn't been treating it with the respect it deserves. She's secretly been hiding chocolates inside it!

<p>Yes, the reason for your muteness is concealed inside that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>knapsack</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If Iris is refusing to talk, it's surely because she's trying to hide something. So all this must be related to some secret she has.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well I certainly don't wish to force her into revealing something she'd rather keep to herself.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But that might mean your father never opens his eyes again!

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, the reason for your muteness is concealed inside that <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>metal chest</b></span>!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
An excellent observation. For upon closer inspection, there is <span style="color:#E16935">something different</span> about the chest's appearance. It's kept locked at all times, yet now...the catch is open.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Evidently, this has something to do with your refusal to speak, Iris.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Nnn...

Ah...so you've found your voice now, Iris.

Ah!

In other words...what just happened clearly reveals the truth here. Yes, the real reason for your silence until now is...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
This is somewhat different to the usual 'dance of deduction' you perform with Mr Sholmes, isn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, he's left me alone on the ballroom floor, so I'm going to have to dance this next part solo. And anyway, I need to get to the bottom of this, for my own peace of mind. Now then...Iris isn't usually the silent type, so...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You mean you don't actually know the answer yet? Despite that knowing point of the finger before.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Miss Susato... ...sometimes a man needs to point his finger first and think later.

<p>Yes, the real reason for your silence until now is...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
How wonderful to hear Iris's voice again.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's just a shame it took Mr Sholmes being thrown across the room to make it happen.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, that gives me an idea... If we threw you across the room as well, she might talk some more!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Iris made a sudden movement just before she spoke that's playing on my mind. I think we'd better have another good look around, whilst trying not to be too rude by staring at her.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, do try to be sensitive, Mr Naruhodo...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, the real reason for your silence until now is...that <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>key</b></span> behind your back!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
When Mr Sholmes was thrown into the air before... Just before you called out to try to stop him, you slipped something out of your mouth. That 'something' is the key now in your hands. No doubt the key to <span style="color:#E16935">the chest</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You're so... You're so clever, Runo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So now it becomes clear. Thanks to Mr Sholmes's graphic demonstration... ...we can well imagined what happened here.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
B-But...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Professor Mikotoba also opened that metal chest only to be punched into the air... ...and land sprawled on the settee.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But, wait! That doesn't explain all the facts. What about <span style="color:#E16935">the stylish scarf</span>...and <span style="color:#E16935">the cup of tea</span>. And above all... ...why would he be wearing <span style="color:#E16935">Kazuma-sama's mask</span>?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, for those curious details...I can think of only one explanation. Clearly an unbelievable miracle took place in this room. Isn't that right, Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Consider how the room was arranged before this whole painful experience took place. When Professor Mikotoba opened the chest, completely unaware of what awaited him inside... ...<span style="color:#E16935">the mask</span> was flung into the air just as he was, only to land neatly on his face when it fell back down. And <span style="color:#E16935">the teacup</span>'s journey through the air ended when it caught on the unconscious professor's finger.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You, you mean to say that the stylish scarf...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...is actually just <span style="color:#E16935">a tablecloth</span>. This is the great detective's office, after all - a place of miraculous deductions. Would you expect anything less?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
......... Yes. You're right. It happened exactly as you said. ...Brilliant, Runo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Thus concludes Ryunosuke Naruhodo's great deduction... of this punchy puzzle!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Iris:<br />

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
An admirable performance, Mr Naruhodo. But in the final act of the show there, you rather missed everything of importance.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
M-Mr Sholmes!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
If you would cast your mind back to my earlier deduction... Iris...clearly you're hiding <span style="color:#E16935">a great secret</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...She is...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(From the look on her face... ...Mr Sholmes must be right. Whatever that <span style="color:#E16935">great secret</span> is...the cat isn't out of the bag yet.)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So I put it to you again... You were attempting to abscond with that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>coffee cup</b></span>!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It really is a shame about Mr Sholmes's cup.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It must have been smashed when Professor Mikotoba opened the chest.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear...so many things seem to have been broken here.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But now that the deduction has taken a different direction... ...Iris doesn't seem to be trying to hide the broken cup any more.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
In other words, her great secret is something else.

Yes, it's Mr Sholmes's coffee cup. That's what Iris was trying to leave with, before anyone noticed it was broken. But she doesn't appear to be making any attempt to shield it from view.

Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.

Oh...yes, that's true.

As a logician, you will never surpass me. The science of deduction and analysis requires long and patient study. I'm several steps ahead of you. And your attempts to correct me serve only to highlight your deficiencies.

Perhaps you'll allow me to offer an opinion here. As far as I can tell...much like that bag, your deduction doesn't hold water, my dear fellow.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you mean, this <span style="color:#E16935">autopsy report</span> really is...

Yes, I took it from the lab. Even though I knew it was very important.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Was there something in it that troubled you, Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
......... Not exactly something that troubled me. Something I'd been looking for. When I saw this report... When I saw the writing in it... ...I knew it was Daddy's.

Mr Sholmes! What is it?

Perhaps we should find our guest somewhere more peaceful to rest? Mr Naruhodo!

Would you be so kind as to lend him your bed? We must do our very best to make him comfortable, I feel.

Oh...yes, of course. I'll help you carry him up.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So will I!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
No no, I can manage alone, thank you. You have tea to enjoy. We wouldn't want Iris's brew to stew.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Because there's no better way to make the professor comfortable than dragging him upstairs like a trunk.)</span> I wonder... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Perhaps that was deliberate.

</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. And that notes about all the cases they solved together are kept inside that <span style="color:#E16935">metal chest</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's right. Hurley told me, you see. He said that Daddy's somewhere far away now, so we can't meet.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's one way of describing it.)</span>

Well, that's only natural.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You're just like any other girl of your age.

I read that Daddy was a professor of medical science, so I studied and took my degree, too.

In that respect, you're not quite like any other girl of your age, though.

His name wasn't anywhere on any of the notes that he'd made about his work with Hurley. But then one day...

That's what happened, is it? When you saw this <span style="color:#E16935">autopsy report</span>, you finally managed to work it out. Is that right?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Because it was the same as the writing you'd seen on your father's <span style="color:#E16935">case notes</span>?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Exactly. I was desperate to compare the two properly. I needed to see them side by side. I asked the doctor in the laboratory, but I was told I couldn't take the report away. And even worse, I was told that was the first and last time we'd be allowed even to look at it there.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you decided...to steal it.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
......... When I compared the autopsy report with the case notes I had here... ...there was no doubt. The handwriting was exactly <span style="color:#E16935">the same</span>. It was Daddy's.

And <span style="color:#E16935">the signature</span> of the coroner at the bottom of the autopsy report...

I see...

Ever since then, I've called myself Iris Wilson. And that's also when I had the brilliant idea... ...of writing stories all about Daddy's exciting times with Hurley. I decided there and then that I'd write 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'!

Ten years ago...is when Father returned to Japan after his extended study tour in Britain.

Ah, of course! He was an assistant in <span style="color:#E16935">Dr Wilson's laboratory</span>, learning about forensic science.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And as an assistant, he would have aided with the dissection work, making detailed notes... ...which would be assembled into the full autopsy report. Once the work was complete, the head coroner would check the contents and put <span style="color:#E16935">his signature</span> on the document.

So...this autopsy report was actually penned by Professor Mikotoba then? But that makes no sense! It's not possible, surely?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Not possible? My dear fellow! Pray, take a deep breath and think again.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, you're right. In some ways... ...it actually makes a great deal of <span style="color:#E16935">sense</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It, it does?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ten years ago...is when Father returned to Japan after his extended study tour in Britain.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And prior to his return, where was Dr Mikotoba engaged?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, of course! He was an assistant in <span style="color:#E16935">Dr Wilson's laboratory</span>, learning about forensic science.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And as an assistant, he would have aided with the dissection work, making detailed notes... ...which would be assembled into the full autopsy report. Once the work was complete, the head coroner would check the contents and put <span style="color:#E16935">his signature</span> on the document.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Thinking about it... ...most of what we know about you, Mr Sholmes, comes from <span style="color:#E16935">the published stories</span> of your exploits.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' written by Iris.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And we really have no way of knowing... ...what's <span style="color:#E16935">fact</span> and what's <span style="color:#E16935">fiction</span>.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Most troubling for you, my dear fellow, I'm sure.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So what about this supposed partner of yours? Did he really exist or not?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, you've come straight to the point, I see.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...And please come straight to the answer!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I believe Iris explained it in one of her instalments. He was a trusted comrade, and the only person I could truly have called a friend.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And did this partner of yours truly make a record of all your cases? Are his notes really stored inside that metal chest?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Absolutely, my dear madam. Absolutely.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...where's your partner now?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... We rarely meet. You see...he lives <span style="color:#E16935">on the other side of the world</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But if this autopsy report and the records of all your old cases were penned by the same hand... ...and if the autopsy report was written - though not signed - by your famous partner... ...there would be only one logical conclusion.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Pray, impress me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Your partner would have to be Yujin Mikotoba. In other words...Miss Susato's father.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... 'Pon my word, Mr Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You are coming along wonderfully. You have hit upon the method at last! You've finally grasped the art of deduction!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You, you mean to say...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Allow me to introduce you... ...to my great friend and partner...Mikotoba.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
P-Professor Mikotoba!

</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! Of, of course...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is obviously too much for Susato-san to take in.)</span>
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I must say, though... ...how my old friend has attained world-wide celebrity as a great mystery-solver is the greatest mystery of all!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I still remember the first time we met... Ah, pray remind me...when was it again, Mikotoba?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Sixteen years ago, Sholmes.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah yes, quite! Sixteen years ago!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I'd just arrived from Japan with Seishiro and Genshin. I was in search of lodgings close to the hospital. Some comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But rents are devilishly high in that particular area.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
That's right. So I decided I needed someone to share lodgings and the expense... ...and was fortunate enough to be introduced to Sholmes who found himself in a similar situation.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I was a callow fellow back then. A mere shadow of the great detective you see before you now. I was working at the hospital's chemical laboratory at the time, indulging my curiosities for little gain.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
And the situation of our cohabitation led to us pursuing cases together, you see. Hard to believe it was a mere six years. We had a great many adventures.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But in the last year of Mikotoba's stay in Britain, that most infamous of cases presented itself. The case with which you've become rather familiar yourselves: the Professor killings.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
After the trial...Seishiro and I were summoned back home.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hardly surprising, given the circumstances.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So there you have it. And as you know, all the details recorded by my trusty chronicler remain in that metal chest.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is just amazing! Professor Mikotoba really IS Mr Sholmes's famous partner!)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Father.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
G-Goodness, my dear. What a cutting look!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
As your daughter, I'm very proud to learn that you were the great detective's <span style="color:#E16935">great partner</span>. But nevertheless... ...there's another mystery that I really must ask you to explain now.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
And, and that is...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You know very well what it is. The unresolved matter of Iris's <span style="color:#E16935">father</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Of course! I'd almost forgotten about that one!)</span>
