<i>Anime cutscene</i><br />
'It's coming!' Sholmes' cry pierced through the thick wall of fog around us. Wisps of vapour flowed over the pistol as I cocked it, and I waited breathlessly in the stillness. The silence lasted for what seemed an eternity until, at last, it appeared. From the shadows of the cloud, an enormous beast sprang out upon us. A hound it was, but not such a hound as any mortal has ever seen. Its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, the whole of its ox-sized body was outlined in white-hot flames. Its rumbling pant and hideous howl... So terrified was I that I began to tremble with fear. 'Look well, Wilson!' Sholmes declared, gazing upon the mystical beast. 'For this! This is the diabolical Hound of the Baskervilles!'
</p>
<hr />
<center>Our first two months in London passed by in a flash. In that disconcerting courtroom experience we were first thrown into on the day we arrived in the country... ...and in Soseki-san's terrible ordeal that had followed closely behind, we had emerged victorious. However... ...there then came an abrupt end to our opportunities to appear in court. Which was hardly surprising, of course... ...since I was nothing more than an amateur, an unknown student of law from a faraway land. So life in our little office was very quiet. That is... ...until it was shattered one day, by that fateful telegram...</center>

Even two months on, the cause of that dreadful <span style="color:#E16935">fire</span> is still a mystery.

Yes, but at least Soseki-san is safely out of the country now. Presumably that means...

If the legend of the Reaper is to be believed, it would mean he wields the sword of justice himself.

Come to think of it, I wonder what he's been up to these past two months. Surely...not wielding that sword against more acquitted defendants...

Oh?

Really? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Just like before...when he wasn't seen in court at all for several years.)</span> So, it's just been me who's had to face him in his recent spate of trials, then? Ugh...just my luck.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
G-Good morning. 
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... A good morning to die perhaps...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Has something happened, Mr Sholmes? You look miserable, and...the way you were playing the violin before...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hmph. My analytical mind is dead. Music is dead. The world...is dead. Damn this blanched existence! ...That's all it is, my dear fellow. Nothing of consequence. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm afraid I don't understand. 
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, Iris? Isn't it time we ate? Some dry toast and insipid coffee for me...if it's not too much trouble. 
</p><p>???:<br />
Miaow...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh look, it's Wagahai. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Good morning, boy. 
</p><p>Wagahai:<br />
Miaow. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(That must be some sort of tiny door for cats to use. But how did it get there?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well then, everyone, time for breakfast! 
</p><p>Susato:<br />

Ugh...it would indeed be a fine day to die...

Mr Natsume's cat seems to have settled in to his new home, then.

Oh yes! And I've become very attached to little Waggy.

Hmph. It would appear his previous owner is completely forgotten to him. Cats are unfeeling creatures. Their mews as empty as the hearts of the Muses.

If Mr Natsume had no intention of taking Waggy back to Japan, I wonder why he kept him in the first place. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I expect he would have taken him if he could. But pets are strictly forbidden aboard steamships in our experience.

And for good reason! Terrible things can happen if the rules of passage are not obeyed. 
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, I don't mind. Because Waggy is adorable!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, he really is. Oh yes, what about the door? I don't remember seeing that tiny thing in the main door before. Where did that come from?

Oh, you noticed? You are observant, Runo! Look! I used this! It's my latest invention!

What...what is that?

I call it...the Cat-Flapomat!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Gosh! A machine for making doors just for cats?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's right. It can make a cat flap for a little furry friend like Waggy in seconds! And it can do it in any door at all, no matter what it's made of! It's very powerful, you see. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Wouldn't it have been quicker just to make the cat flap, rather than making a machine to make the cat flap?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well! Yes, maybe... But now I can make cat flaps anywhere I like!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, I think it's wonderful! You must make one for us in the door of our office upstairs, Iris!

Um, what did you mean when you said we didn't fully understand <span style="color:#E16935">how pawnbroking works</span>?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
To the people of London, pawnbrokeries are akin to banks.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Banks?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
On Mondays, merchants relinquish their finest jackets and trappings to their pawnbroker of choice. With the money they receive in return, they are able to trade happily through the week.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
And then on Saturdays, they go to recover their things using the money they've earnt.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I had no idea! This has been a fascinating lesson for us!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Everyone does it, you see. Especially people in Inner London.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And should they have money to spare, they would purchase another fine jacket. Not to wear, obviously. But to pawn, should the need arise.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! How ingenious!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So whenever we have something that's getting in the way, we leave it at Windibank's, you see.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
A pawnbrokery can be thought of as an extremely secure vault.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Who would have thought that even pawnbrokers are different here in Great Britain?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Of course, you have to watch Hurley with it. Sometimes he pawns things he really shouldn't. ...Don't you, Hurley?

I believe... ...it's an entirely different instrument, called a '<span style="color:#E16935">viola</span>'!

Wha...wha...wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, Mr Sholmes! Are you alright?

</p><p>Iris:<br />

Yes, indeed.

So you sent your beloved violin to the pawnbroker's in the hope that it would experience personal growth?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, what a wonderful idea!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Last week I pawned my Great Analytiscope in order to release my precious instrument. But it would appear Mr Windibank mistakenly furnished me with this tawdry fiddle instead. But my ears cannot be deceived by the hollow timbre of this piece of timber!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...No, but your every sense was deceived by the fact that it just had strings.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Pshaw, a fine state of affairs this is! And why I always say, Mr Naruhodo: Never trust a pawnbroker! They will try to fiddle you every time!

</p><p>Windibank:<br />
Yes, sir, indeed. Many of my customers utilise the establishment as you describe. I appraise their items, and offer them a proportionate loan and two months of secure stowage. If, in that time, they repay the original sum to me plus the agreed interest, their items are happily returned.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But what happens if they don't pay you the money?
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
Then the items are offered for sale in my shop. As you can see on the shelves behind me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So you never sell items before the two months has passed, then?
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
That's right, ma'am, that's right! Which means some considerable responsibility rests on my shoulders. Should a customer's precious belongings be lost, the only recompense is for me to end it all!

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Very astute! It is indeed a camera, furnished with some hundred pieces of celluloid film. And every thirty minutes precisely, the camera automatically records the appearance of the shop.
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
Here, I have an example I can show you...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah yes, a print from the camera set to record the activity at the shop counter. I developed a special type of film so sensitive, it produces a crystal-clear image even in darkness.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Really? That's...extraordinary.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, you can clearly see the counter and the door behind it, look.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So you see, were someone to enter the premises with ill intent, his identity would be summarily exposed.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But...did you not say that the photographic prints were taken <span style="color:#E16935">at thirty-minute intervals</span>?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed, as you say, my dear madam.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Then what if the incident were to occur in between times?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
One could only say...that would be a cruel twist of fate!
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
Hmmm... I must confess your devices have been giving me some cause for distress of late.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I beg your pardon, Mr Windibank? Surely they are anything but distressing. Reassuring is the word!
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
It's the cost of the film, sir. You most graciously placed not one, but two cameras in my shop, after all. Which means I must pay for nigh on one hundred utterly useless prints every single day. I'm afraid the cost of the film will break me before I'm very much older.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... Nevertheless, a small price to pay to ensure the safety of my preferred pawnbrokery, no? My dear fellows! We verge on an age where safety and security come at a price.
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
Oh! Heaven help us!

This particular specimen is of the larger variety, commonly found in public houses and restaurants. There is a metal disk inside on which the notes to be played are recorded. Simply by replacing the disk with another, any music you care to imagine can be played.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

When you pawn - or colloquially 'pop' - an item, the broker loans you money against its worth. He stores the item for an agreed period of time, after which the loan must be repaid. If not... ...he is free to display it in his shop for sale, at a price of his choosing.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh yes. Now you've explained it, I'm noticing little price tags on everything.

Allow me to enlighten you, my dear fellows. What you are looking at is a stereoscope.

Just before you do, there is something I should point out. My dear fellows... In order to see the image properly - stereoscopically, as it were - you will need to be <span style="color:#E16935">cross-eyed</span>. However, if that is beyond you, it is of little consequence today.

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, the sense of depth is startling, is it not? Stereoscopes are one of London's many fads. They are often found in little stalls in the park. People queue for hours to see them.

...I know what a music box is. I've just never seen one of these disks before.

The small protrusions on the metal disk encode the tune to be played by the music box. You simply insert the disk and set the machine going, and beautiful music plays!

It's so incredible! Tell us, what tune is on this disk?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
For this heavy, black coat, which you returned to her care, as I'd understood it.
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
That's right, yes. And rather unsurprisingly, as soon as the little ragamuffin put the thing on... ...she went rifling through the pockets.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, you mean...?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Wot?! Don't know it's rude to stare at a lady?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah, I see! So it came from the pocket of the overcoat, did it?
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
If you mean this disk, then yes, exactly, ma'am.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And she immediately tried <span style="color:#E16935">to pawn it</span>...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
For quite <span style="color:#E16935">a high price</span> as well... <span style="color:#0070C0">(This is all rather suspicious, I think.)</span>
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Give it up! I'm just tryin' to pawn somefin' like anyone else would.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Miss Lestrade, may I ask who deposited the overcoat here in the first place?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Um...well...me...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It...doesn't really appear to be your size.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Me old man! It's me old man's, ain't it?

So...about these <span style="color:#E16935">watchwords</span>, Mr Windibank...
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
As I just explained... ...I never ask customers' names when they deposit items with me. There are many reasons why certain customers would like to keep their activities secret.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That wasn't exactly a subtle glance at Mr Sholmes now, was it?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Great detectives have no dark secrets! None at all!
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
Yes, well... Anyway, that's why I always ask for a watchword whenever I accept a new article. In many ways, it's like <span style="color:#E16935">the secret combination</span> of numbers used to unlock a vault. The date of deposit, a description and a watchword uniquely identify each item. And of course then I give the storage ticket to the customer. When someone comes to redeem something, I ask for the ticket and <span style="color:#E16935">the watchword</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And if that someone tells you the correct watchword, you return the article?
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
That's right, sir, yes. Just as soon as the requisite fee is paid.
</p><p>???/Benedict:<br />
And I have supplied you with the information you require already. But for the avoidance of doubt: The article in question is an overcoat. Deposited two months ago, on 15th February. With a watchword of...'Professor'.
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
All perfectly correct information, sir.

But, but 'ow...?

Erm...Mr Sholmes... ...what are you examining with such keen interest there? As you enjoy a bar of caramel, I see.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... So... ...you've found me at last...Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
After that young pickpocket sent me on my way, I was forced to lurk in the shadows. Cruelly ostracised, as the rest of you partook in the jovial atmosphere of fellowship. I had nothing to occupy my mind, but was too ashamed to let society see what my downfall had done to me. So feigning mock interest, I pretended to examine the tedious trinkets in this desolate place. ...Whilst, as you shrewdly observed, gnawing on the only friend I have left: this seven per cent solution of caramel. Pray, do you claim to understand the depths of my despair, Mr Naruhodo? But how could you?! I was so lonely... So desperately lonely...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then...why on earth didn't you rejoin the conversation? Things have gone from bad to worse here, you know!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />

Poor Mr Sholmes. I feel simply awful for you.

</p><p>Benedict:<br />
I beg your pardon?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The first is this: The true reason for your visit to this pawnbrokery today is something you have not yet revealed.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And the second is this: A considerable crime is in contemplation. One you will orchestrate, with intent to steal a vast sum of money. Well, Mr Benedict? What say you to my deductions?
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
How...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's turned as white as a hard-boiled egg!)</span>

</p><p>Benedict:<br />
Just who do you think you are, sir?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah yes, as I hoped... That is precisely the pained expression I was looking for. So...shall we begin? The time has come for yet another Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!
</p>
<hr />
<center>
<b>The Great Deduction</b><br />The game is afoot!</center>
<p><br />
<b>Topic 1</b><br />
Mystery Man's Aim
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>staff recruitment flyer</b></span>! The piece of paper in your hand is a 'staff wanted' advertisement from this very shop. Yet even the most unobservant would soon realise that a man of your appearance has no need of such employ. In other words...there is some <span style="color:#E16935">ulterior motive</span> for your actions.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits <span style="color:#E16935">an incontrovertible contradiction</span>.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>missing ferrule</b></span>. The end of any walking cane would be terminated with a metal ferrule to protect the wooden tip. And yet detailed analysis shows the wooden tip of this stick to be utterly bare. Therefore...there is only one conclusion: The rod that you hold in your hand, which appears to be a walking cane... ...is in fact no cane at all!
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong?
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
I... Well, I...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear?
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The <span style="color:#E16935"><b>handle</b></span>, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. From the moment I saw it, my suspicions were aroused. 'What walking cane demands such a stout handle?' mused I.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But of course, as I said, this is no walking cane. No, that rod... ...is the broken handle of a shovel!
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
Wha...? Are you insane?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And now, having determined this undeniable truth, the conclusion is clear. Your true motive for coming here... ...was to take employment at this establishment in order to excavate the ground beneath the premises! What a calculated crime you have conceived, sir. A wickedly calculated crime.
</p><p><b>Topic 1</b><br />
Mystery Man's Aim
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery
</p><p><br />
<b>Topic 2</b><br />
Great Crime
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate <span style="color:#E16935">crime</span> you have in the planning.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, intend to excavate the ground beneath this pawnbrokery with a broken shovel? What on earth do you propose I could expect to find there? Some long-forgotten treasure, I suppose? Save for such a fanciful theory, what possible reason could I have to do as you say?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh, but there is ample reason... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
What?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Let us consider what would motivate a man to infiltrate a shop such as this and covertly dig beneath its floor... The answer is revealed by the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>council notice</b></span> on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. This letter gives notice of public works to be carried out in the local area. And according to the enclosed plan of the upcoming sewerage works... ...beneath this shop runs a sewer that adjoins another, one that runs under the bank on the opposite side of the road.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
This madness has entered the sewers now, has it?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
By excavating the ground beneath our feet, you would gain access to the waterway... ...that flows in very close proximity to the great vault of the financial institution opposite.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
What are you...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
In summary, sir... ...you devised <span style="color:#E16935">a master plan to pull off an elaborate bank robbery</span> by dint of the underground tunnels!
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
M... Master plan?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... With what <span style="color:#E16935">plunder</span> did the thief hope to make off from the underground vault of the bank?
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
Are you quite serious?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Having consulted with Scotland Yard some days ago, I happen to know the answer. But naturally, the answer is no secret to you, is it, Mr Benedict?
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
I have no idea what you're talking about!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this <span style="color:#E16935"><b>picture postcard</b></span> tells us all we need to know.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
A postcard of the Great Exhibition? I'm afraid you've quite lost me.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Currently in the final stages of preparation, the Great Exhibition will soon be underway. And the government has provided extra funds to complete its centrepiece, the Crystal Tower. Funds that currently sit in the vault of the bank on the other side of this road!
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
Pardon?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, the considerable crime you have been contemplating... ...is <span style="color:#E16935">the theft</span> of that which sits in the vault of that bank, <span style="color:#E16935">the special reserve funds</span> for the Great Exhibition! ...Of course, that is top-secret police information. So keep it under your hat, please.
</p><p><b>Topic 2</b><br />
Great Crime
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this pawnbroking puzzle!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...Mr Sholmes...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, Mr Naruhodo? An impressively upbeat deduction for a detective racked with loneliness, would you not agree?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Was it true what you said about the bank over the road and what it has in its vault?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed. Though few know of its existence. It is one of the government's most closely guarded secrets. Gregson told me, in the strictest confidence.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But you just announced it to everyone here. Rather loudly, in fact.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...Ah.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And if it's such a big secret... ...how would Mr Benedict have come to find out about it?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
There can be but one explanation for that. Clearly it is because the man is <span style="color:#E16935">a criminal</span>!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But what if he didn't know anything about the money in the vault? If he is a criminal, as you said... ...then buying <span style="color:#E16935">a brand new shovel</span> is sure to be the first thing he does now that you've revealed the secret.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...Oh.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Or if he doesn't... ...maybe Mr Windibank will. He already has plenty of shovels here, after all.
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
Oh my life! I assure you I'm not so unscrupulous!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm, well... Hopefully this has taught you a valuable lesson. Sensitive information must be handled with the utmost of care. One can never be sure that someone privy to secrets won't disclose them. And once the word is out, it's out.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Perhaps I'll think twice before confiding in you next time, Mr Sholmes.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
An excellent idea, Mr Naruhodo. An excellent idea. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well then, Mr Naruhodo, you know what to do, I'm sure.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. Let's listen to that <span style="color:#E16935">great deduction</span> again, and see if we can massage it into shape!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Very well, then. Let us start once more from the beginning... ...of Herlock Sholmes's magnificent '<span style="color:#E16935">Logic and Reasoning Spectacular</span>'!
</p>
<hr />
<center>
<b>Course Correction</b><br />Hold it, Mr Sholmes!</center>
<p><br />
<b>Topic 1</b><br />
Mystery Man's Aim
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>staff recruitment flyer</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So, by Mr Sholmes's reasoning... ...Mr Benedict came here in order to apply for a job so he could dig down through the floor.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. In an attempt to tunnel into the sewers to gain access to the money in the vault of the bank across the road. But...he wouldn't get very far with a broken shovel, would he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No. I think it's fair to say his motives lie elsewhere. The question is, where? What did bring Mr Benedict here at this particular point in time?

<p>Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>staff recruitment flyer</b></span>!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I still don't quite understand why this gentleman came to Mr Windibank's today.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He might look like a smartly dressed man about town, but perhaps he's destitute really. I really think that's the only explanation!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We must stop thinking along those lines, Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...I suppose you're right. Well in that case... ...perhaps there's something in this pawn shop that the man was looking for?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Let's look closely and see if there's anything about his person that gives us a clue.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>info about Miss Lestrade</b></span>!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Quite so, my dear fellow! It would appear that the writing and sketch on the reverse of the flyer... ...pertain to the pickpocket, Miss Lestrade, and to Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery here.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You originally told us... ...that you had merely given chase after Miss Lestrade stole the redemption ticket from you.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But that, sir, is a thinly veiled lie.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It is the information on the back of the flyer that led you here today. By which I mean... Here, to Windibank's Pawnbrokery, and today, the redemption deadline of that overcoat.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So you waited outside for the young girl matching the description you have written down to arrive.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
Hmph!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And you have gone to some lengths to hide the reason for your pursuit of Miss Lestrade. In other words...there is some <span style="color:#E16935">ulterior motive</span> for your actions.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits <span style="color:#E16935">an incontrovertible contradiction</span>.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>missing ferrule</b></span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...what's a ferrule?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's the metal cap commonly found on the end of a cane, Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, the bit that makes the nice clacking sound on the pavement?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, exactly, And Mr Sholmes is right, it appears to be missing on this cane.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...But it doesn't actually look broken, does it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No, it doesn't. Though the gentleman certainly did recoil when Mr Sholmes identified the cane as suspicious.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In other words... ...there's some <span style="color:#E16935">secret</span> about the cane that Mr Benedict would rather we don't know!

A ferrule is to a cane as a hat is to a gentleman. And while the tip of your cane is bare, the top of your head is hatted. I ask you, could there be a more conspicuous contradiction anywhere in the world?!

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
A most astute observation...wouldn't you say, Mr Eggert Benedict?
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
We are led to believe, sir, that your initials are '<span style="color:#E16935">E. B.</span>'. Yet in a most possessive manner, you have in your grasp a cane bearing the initials '<span style="color:#E16935">A. G.</span>'. An incontrovertible contradiction indeed, would you not agree?
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
No! You're, you're wrong. This cane isn't-
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You said before that you'd had that cane for years.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
Grrr...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So don't try to tell us that you just borrowed it from a friend or found it in the park!

I... Well, I...

</p><p>Benedict:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The <span style="color:#E16935"><b>handle</b></span>, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Let's consider the bare bones of what's happened here: Miss Lestrade redeemed that fine-looking overcoat. And now a mysterious man has appeared, introducing himself with a fake name... ...and claiming that the overcoat belongs to him.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But we know that he actually identified Miss Lestrade from a written description. Which suggests that everything else he's told us is untrue.

The initials on the handle of the cane are 'A. G.', but you introduced yourself as Eggert Benedict. In other words, the cane is not yours. So what else about your person belongs to someone else? The truth is, there's nothing you wouldn't take from another man, is there?

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate <span style="color:#E16935">crime</span> you have in the planning.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, designed a wheeze to filch some tawdry article of pawnage? Have you forgotten that I redeemed the article in the proper manner, using the watchword? Had I not been the one to deposit it in the first place... ...how could I possibly have known the relevant details? N'est-ce pas?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh, but the watchword can be discovered... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
What?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Let us consider how one might come to learn a secret watchword relating to the pawned property of another... The method is revealed by the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>council notice</b></span> on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The direction of the deduction must change rather dramatically now, I think.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, no more talk of tunnelling into the sewers. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Which is a pity, because it all sounded rather exciting.)</span> Anyway... ...you can't deny that this mysterious gentleman did know the watchword.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. '<span style="color:#E16935">Professor</span>'... If you didn't know that word, Mr Windibank would never allow you to redeem the article.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Or, looking at it another way... ...if you did know that word, Mr Windibank would allow you to redeem the article whether it was yours or not. <span style="color:#0070C0">(So the question is, could this gentleman have found the watchword out somehow?)</span>

Coercing the broker for information by holding a gun to his head... That's assault. But using the broker's own gun to do it? That's rubbing 'assault' in the wound! But somehow, when none of us were looking, you must have forced Mr Windibank to tell you the watchword!

<p>The method is revealed by the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>council notice</b></span> on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There's no question that Mr Benedict used some wheeze or other to find out the watchword. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Let's think. He only appeared in the shop after Miss Lestrade had redeemed the overcoat...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
He certainly couldn't have overheard Miss Lestrade saying the watchword. So he can only have discovered it from something on this countertop.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(It sounds like I need to have another look and examine things more closely this time.)</span>

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The method is revealed by the <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>notelet</b></span> on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, the broker here follows the same procedure whenever a customer comes to redeem an article. He asks the customer for the watchword, and notes down the response uttered on a notelet he has to hand. Then he consults his ledger, and confirms whether or not the watchword matches that of the article in question.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
I would expect nothing less of a diligent pawnbroker.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But his diligence clearly has its disadvantages.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
What are you talking about?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It is increasingly apparent that you were present in this shop before your accusation against Miss Lestrade.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In all likelihood, you followed her inside, and then observed her talking to Mr Windibank.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
When the diligent broker made a note of the watchword, as is his common practice...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...You observed him writing the word '<span style="color:#E16935">Professor</span>' on the notelet beside the ledger.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And that, sir... ...was the master plan you devised to steal the pawned article from the young Miss Lestrade!
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
M... Master plan?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... Why would you go to such lengths to redeem that particular <span style="color:#E16935">article</span> from this pawnbroker?
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
Are you quite serious?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
For an ill-fitting overcoat hardly seems to justify the effort, much less a worthless music box disk. But naturally, you had very good reason to make them yours, didn't you, Mr Benedict?
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
I have no idea what you're talking about!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this <span style="color:#E16935"><b>picture postcard</b></span> tells us all we need to know.

The articles we're talking about are <span style="color:#E16935">the overcoat</span> and <span style="color:#E16935">the music box disk</span> that was in one of the pockets.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Which according to Mr Windibank, isn't even worth a penny.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And yet this man went to such lengths to steal them... Why?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I wonder if perhaps... ...we already have <span style="color:#E16935">the evidence</span> we need to explain it, Mr Naruhodo.

Mr Sholmes, I'm afraid there's something very troubling on my mind.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Pray tell, Miss Susato.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, according to what Mr Windibank told us earlier... ...<span style="color:#E16935">today</span> was the final day on which the coat could have been redeemed, was it not?
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
Yes, ma'am, that is correct. Today would be precisely two months since it was first deposited.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, today is 15th April, so...two months ago today...
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
...Would have been 15th February, sir, that's right. It's all carefully recorded in my ledger. Deposited at 10:30 p.m., I see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! But, but that suggests...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. 15th February...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Is precisely the day on which the omnibus murder took place!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And half past ten in the evening... ...is precisely the time at which the terrible events were unfolding!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Suggestive is not the word. It would seem the matter is entirely beyond coincidence.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
......... You are of course at liberty to make whatever outlandish deductions you choose. However... ...I must insist you hand over <span style="color:#E16935">the music box disk</span> now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
It would be a terrible shame to return to your native land in a box.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(What do I do?!)</span>

Mr Windibank!
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
This is my shop! I can't allow any harm to come to my customers! If that were to happen... ...I should have to take my own life!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Windibank, no!
</p><p>???:<br />
Alright, that's enough!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Inspector Gregson!
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
Inspector...?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That's right, sunshine. The alarm was raised on one of our dedicated emergency lines. So we got here as fast as we could. Now, what's this all about, eh?
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
Oh, praise be! You're here at last! I was moments away from forfeiting my own life in my very own establishment!
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
......... It would seem you have the upper hand.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Right, you lot have got some explainin' to do! I don't appreciate bein' bothered with some petty argy-bargy!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Petty?! Mr Windibank very nearly met with his end!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yeah, with his own gun, as far as I can tell.
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
Oh dear...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
And the whole of Britain could meet with its end if I don't get to the bottom of the case I'm s'posed to be workin' on!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! What on earth is the case, Inspector?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Spare no detail, Gregson!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
...I, I might have said a little too much. No matter. It's nothin' to do with you lot. Anyway, sir, you're gonna have to come with me down to the station.
</p><p>Benedict:<br />
......... But of course, Inspector...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Aah!
</p>
<center>He's getting away!<br />
Get after him, lads! Whistle the beat officer, too!<br />Sir!</center>
<p><br />
Gregson:<br />
...There's been a spate of thefts at pawn shops round here recently. So we've fitted emergency buttons underneath the counters for brokers to let us know when there's trouble.
</p><p>Windibank:<br />
Oh, Inspector...I was very worried there for a while. Very worried indeed.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Now then, Mr Permanently-in-Mournin'...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! ...Yes?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, yes, of course...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As evidence...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
If the police demand something as evidence, my dear fellow, we have no choice but to capitulate. It's all yours, Inspector.
</p><p>Gina:<br />

See? That's why I 'ate grown-ups. All they do is feed you a pack o' lies and take stuff away from ya!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh really, Miss Lestrade? ...Tell me, is that overcoat keeping you warm?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Wot?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my! Surely, you were given that!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Yeah, the dee let me keep it. After I looked daggers at 'im for long enough. 'E went through the pockets and then said, 'Go on, then, 'ave it' before tellin' me to scarper. Always pays off, givin' people a look like you 'ate 'em.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I can't help feeling that it's going to get you into serious trouble one day...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Wot I really wanted was that nice, shiny <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span>, mind.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The music box <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span>?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But Mr Windibank said it was practically worthless.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I think I'm gonna go and 'ave another bash. Give 'em a long, 'ard stare.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I think not, Miss Lestrade. We shan't enter Windibank's again today.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Why not?! That's not fair!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It can't be helped, I'm afraid. The police are investigating the scene now, and taking a statement from Mr Windibank.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
But that disk's mine! I 'ad the ticket for this coat, and it was in this coat's pocket! And there should be <span style="color:#E16935">somefin' else</span> an' all! That's wot that rotten cove said, ain't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Miss Lestrade, I think it's time to admit defeat. You've had your 'haul' for the day.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Yeah! And it's all your fault, Sholmes!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So what are your plans now? Will you dine with us this evening?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Iris would be delighted to cook, I'm sure. And I might entertain you with a modest violin recital.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... No, ta.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Why would I come round your place, eh? 'Ave you lost your 'ead or somefin'?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear. She's gone.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm, having reviled on me quite unnecessarily, I might add.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I...can't help wondering... ...if perhaps she might turn up anyway.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Interesting...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Once she's had a chance to calm down, I think there's a good chance she'll decide to come.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... Very well, then. I'll inform Iris to set a place for our potential guest at the dinner table this evening. And one more thing... I should be glad of your company later, too.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I believe I will have a rather splendid surprise to show you.

Good afternoon, Iris.

Thank you so much for breakfast this morning.

Oh, don't mention it! ...Goodness! Look at the time already!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Busy as always?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I am! I'm preparing everything for dinner this evening.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Already? You're obviously cooking something special, are you?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, yes! After all, we have a special guest joining us! Guess who it is! Go on! Hee hee, you'll never guess!

Oh! Oh...what a surprise! Yes, that's wonderful news!

I can't wait to learn some pickpocketing tips from a real professional!

Oh yes! That does sound like fun!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm not sure that's entirely appropriate. Are you, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Erm... By the way, Iris, what's Mr Sholmes up to?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hurley? Oh, he's been like that ever since he got back.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Hellooo! Mr Sholmes!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I beg that you won't speak to me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I don't know who you are, but kindly take your leave. As you can see, I'm not here.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I, I don't know how to respond to that.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I do apologise. When he gets like this, he's completely oblivious to everything.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes... I see...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Really, he behaves just like a child sometimes, Hurley does.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Sholmes and Iris have something of a parent-and-child relationship, don't they?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, except that <span style="color:#E16935">Iris</span> is clearly the parent here... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Come to think of it... ...I wonder where her <span style="color:#E16935">real parents</span> are.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What's the matter, Runo? You have ever such a funny look on your face!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...no...it's nothing.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I know what it is! 'Why does this girl live here with Mr Sholmes?' you're wondering. ...Am I right?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How?! How did you...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Heh heh, oh, Runo! I can read you like a book!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh... This girl is dangerous...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Don't worry, you can ask me anything! I won't mind.

My mummy and daddy aren't with me any more.

Mummy passed away when I was born. And at around the same time, my father... Well, he had to go to a faraway land because of one of the cases he and Hurley were working on.

Oh... Wait a minute... Did you say, '<span style="color:#E16935">he and Hurley</span>'?

<span style="color:#0070C0">(She didn't mention that before...)</span>

He wrote them all up in his diaries. That's what's in the metal chest over there.

Exactly! Hurley told me I wasn't allowed to look in the chest. But that only made me want to look even more! ...So I opened it up.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And found your father's memoirs.

Yes. So I asked Hurley: 'Who wrote these?' He nearly fell off his chair! But then he told me. That's when I found out that the author of all those accounts... ...was my father.

I've practically lived with Hurley all my life. I was tiny when he took me in. So...it came as quite a shock. When Hurley told me he wasn't really my daddy, I mean.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It must have done.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I wonder why Mr Sholmes chose to tell you. And at such a young age.

Hurley says it's because he <span style="color:#E16935">wouldn't have been able to hide it</span> from me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh?

Well, having lived with Hurley all these years, you might say that his ways have rubbed off on me. There are some things I can just...<span style="color:#E16935">see</span>. Especially lies. I almost know when people are lying before they open their mouths sometimes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Oh, I see.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
The other day it was so embarrassing. As usual, he totally forgot about the case he'd just solved... ...so the very next day he gathered together all the people involved and proceeded to solve the case <span style="color:#E16935">again</span>! It was quite a shock for everyone!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...You can say that again.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...You share your father's surname, don't you, Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's right! Wilson. Daddy is <span style="color:#E16935">Dr John H. Wilson</span>! I learnt from his diaries that he's <span style="color:#E16935">a doctor of medicine</span>, you see. That's what prompted me to study and study so that I could earn a doctorate as well!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Iris's father...who went to some distant land... ...and is a doctor by the name of <span style="color:#E16935">John H. Wilson</span>...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
The court will now hear the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Kindly state before the court the name of <span style="color:#E16935">the victim</span> in this case.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The victim's name was <span style="color:#E16935">Dr John H. Wilson</span>.
</p>
<hr />
<center>That's right...visiting professor of medicine at Imperial Yumei University... ...and the man who, in the most bizarre of circumstances, lost his life just before we left Japan.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Susato...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Yes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Perhaps we shouldn't pursue this conversation any further at this time.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...I think that would be for the best.

I, I don't understand... How did that <span style="color:#E16935">disk</span> come to be in your possession? I thought Inspector Gregson took it back to Scotland Yard.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Quite correct. And that sort of uncompromising attitude is precisely why I always carry some of this.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's...a bar of caramel, Mr Sholmes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Your one and only friend in times of loneliness, if I'm not mistaken.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
If you will humour me, my dear fellows... ...cast your minds back to when the good detective confiscated the disk.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gregson:<br />
I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, yes, of course...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
If the police demand something as evidence, my dear fellow, we have no choice but to capitulate. It's all yours, Inspector.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Sholmes:<br />
For the briefest of moments, I had <span style="color:#E16935">the disk</span> in my hand, did I not?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes... Yes, you did. But...I still don't understand.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It was at precisely that moment, that I <span style="color:#E16935">summoned my one and only friend into action</span>. I pressed the disk into a pair of bars...like this.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's...that's amazing! The disk and all the miniscule protrusions have made <span style="color:#E16935">an image</span> in the caramel!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed. This caramel is quite exceptional. I developed it myself, you know. Suitably soft for making impressions, but resistant to melting. The result of a precisely controlled solution.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
How extraordinary!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Carrying a pair of these on one's person frequently proves very useful indeed. Take a house key, for example. A simple press, and its unique <span style="color:#E16935">form</span> is duplicated. I can enter anyone's property at will. And never without high-sucrose nourishment.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yeees... It sounds...illegal.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
From <span style="color:#E16935">the image</span>, I was able to create this. I confess I was most curious to know what manner of music would issue from the disk when played.

Do tell us, then, Mr Sholmes! What music does <span style="color:#E16935">the disk</span> play?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well...unfortunately I have no idea.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No idea?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
None whatsoever. Are you familiar with <span style="color:#E16935">the workings</span> of a music box, my dear fellows?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, I'm afraid not.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Goodness! You don't know, Runo? Inside a music box, there's a special metal piece called a 'comb'. That's what produces the sound. Small protuberances pluck the different teeth of the comb as they rotate past it, making the different notes. The first music boxes to be invented used <span style="color:#E16935">a rotating cylinder</span> with protuberances on it.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But over time, a new type of player was produced, which uses <span style="color:#E16935">disks</span> such as these. With that development, the popularity of music boxes spread far and wide. All around the globe.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Why, exactly?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Because the disks are easy to produce, and can be interchanged to facilitate the playing of different tunes. There are a great many firms in Europe now manufacturing music boxes as a result.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It is wonderful to be able to enjoy music, even when no performer is present.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But it is the very success of the invention that means we are now presented with an insurmountable problem.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As you may imagine, the construction of one firm's music box does not match that of another. And we have no way of knowing in which music box this particular disk was designed to be played. There is no resolution to this problem, I'm afraid. It's quite intractable.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, I see. So that's why...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Naturally, I tested the disk in those few music boxes I have at my disposal. But as you can hear, to no avail. The results were equally unsatisfactory in this one. So... ...I am presently engaged in acquiring an example of all the music boxes ever made in Europe.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
E-Every single one?!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's Hurley for you. Always taking things too far.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But, my dear girl! An unsolved riddle is quite repugnant to my constitution!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But surely all the different types in Europe will amount to a huge volume of music boxes, won't it?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm, yes, that is certainly true. In the worst case... ...I shall just have to ask you to vacate the attic room.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!

Oh, well you must let me help you, then.

Of course, Susie! There's plenty to do.

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm, yes... You may be right.

Oh, that reminds me! Of something Mr Windibank said before. He said that he had a manuscript of Iris's in pawn, didn't he?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Did he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, he definitely mentioned it. 'Mr Sholmes's <span style="color:#E16935">latest tale of otherworldly mystery</span> lies dormant in my storeroom,' were his words, I believe.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Iris:<br />
But Runo, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... ...has <span style="color:#E16935">never been published</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
When I showed Hurley the manuscript, he told me that I wasn't allowed to publish it yet.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't understand...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's why he said that he'd keep it safe. Until it was the right time for the story to be made public, you see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So that's why the manuscript is at Windibank's...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
And yet, how could Susie here know its title? Well Hurley? What's going on?

</p><p>Iris:<br />
It's not exactly a story that I made up. It's something I read in Daddy's diaries.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
'Daddy's'...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's right. I don't suppose I've mentioned it to you before, Ginny, but... ...my daddy was Hurley's assistant once. His <span style="color:#E16935">partner</span>.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh?!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
They solved all sorts of strange and mysterious cases together.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Is, is that right, mister?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Apparently so. I was as surprised as you are, though.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
And Daddy wrote all the details of every single case down, you see. In his diaries. So I study them and write my stories based on what actually happened.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
So...where's yer old man now then?
</p><p>Iris:<br />

I don't really know. But it must be <span style="color:#E16935">special</span> in some way. Because after I'd written it and I showed the manuscript to Hurley... ...he turned white as a sheet. It was the first time I've ever seen him like that.

Well in that case, why not colour in the other eye now... ...and then every time you win a new case, give it an extra eye. You can never have too many eyes, you know.

Iris:<br />
Hurley! ...Oh! He's not here!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No. That's strange... The nurse definitely said he was in the bed by the window, didn't she?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ooh, I know what's probably happened! Hurley was being a big baby. And the bullet wound wasn't that bad after all so he's been sent home.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm, I'm not so sure about that. Baby or not... ...there's no question that it was a fairly serious injury that Mr Sholmes suffered.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>???:<br />
'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere?
</p><p>Bobby:<br />
This ward is off limits! No visitin'! So what are you doin' in 'ere, eh?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, I'll have you know, we're Hurley's next of kin!
</p><p>Bobby:<br />
Eh? ...Oh! Well beggin' your pardon then, ma'am. Sir. ...A little lady and a curious Eastern gentleman... The great mystery-solver 'as a mysterious family, eh.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...If that's how you see us, um...sure.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Where is he, Constable? Where's Hurley?
</p><p>Bobby:<br />
I believe 'e is currently in the operatin' theatre, ma'am. Undergoin' an extensive operation.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Extensive?!
</p><p>Bobby:<br />
It 'as been several 'ours since 'e went in.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh dear... Is he going to be alright?
</p><p>Bobby:<br />
Well, it doesn't appear to be workin', you see. The anaesthetic, that is.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Bobby:<br />
I 'ave 'eard a report that the gentleman claims 'e may 'ave 'ad a little too much to drink last night. Coffee, that is.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Haah...
</p><p>Bobby:<br />
Anyway, I think it would be fair to assume that 'e won't be back 'ere for several 'ours yet.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I see. Thank you, Constable. Perhaps we should leave and come back later.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, poor Hurley...

Iris:<br />
This is where it happened, then? Last night.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right. The two thugs I told you about were obviously ransacking the place, looking for valuables.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But... ...apart from the policemen in here, you wouldn't know anything had happened. There's no sign of a disturbance.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No...you're right about that, actually.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
In fact, if anyone, it's the police who seem to be the ones doing the ransacking.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I know what you mean. They're like a gang of organised criminals, all dressed in black!
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>Oi! I heard that!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, Inspector! Erm... Good morning.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Hmph. I s'pose I ought to thank you for your vigilance last night. We got to the scene before it was disturbed at least. Shame you let the two rogues get away, mind.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes... I'm sorry about that.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...I thought you'd assigned extra men to the beat around here, Gregsy. Now look what's happened! Hurley's been injured because there weren't enough police on duty!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
.........Ah! Y...Y...Your Ladyship! No one told me you were comin'!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I expect you to take full responsibility for what happened to Hurley and see he has the very best medical care!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Of course, Your Ladyship! The very best doctors in the capital are tendin' to him as we speak!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
And I don't think it's Runo's fault that the rogues managed to get away, is it? Chasing criminals is the police's job.

Absolutely, Your Ladyship! As you say, ma'am, as you say! The gent in black is totally blameless! Everyone's in agreement about that.

Are you going to tell me what this important message is then, Inspector?

Yeah, it's about that young lady who's normally by your side. Your assistant.

Dear Susie! Is she alright?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
She's at the station, isn't she? Being questioned, I believe.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Nope, not any more. She had to head off.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Head off? Where?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
To Lord Stronghart's office, of course. He <span style="color:#E16935">summoned</span> her.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, of course. I'd forgotten about that.)</span>
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
One of the whipstocks took her there in a Yard carriage after we'd finished questioning her. But she asked us to tell you she didn't have the fare for the return journey and to go and meet her there. ...She's got a nerve, usin' Scotland Yard as a bloomin' messagin' service!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I see. Well, thank you for passing that on, Inspector.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Why did Susie have to go to see the Lord Chief Justice?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
She...didn't tell me. <span style="color:#0070C0">(But I'd better head over to <span style="color:#E16935">the Lord Chief Justice's office</span> to fetch her straight away.)</span>

Of course, Lord Stronghart.

The girl currently has no representation.

But, but that's not fair! Yes, she may be a pickpocket, but she still deserves a fair trial!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...Do not misunderstand me, young lady. The government provides for those too poor to afford representation with a public defender. The accused need only sign the relevant paperwork, and a defence barrister will be assigned to the case. However...the young girl in question has <span style="color:#E16935">refused</span> that right.

Ain't it obvious? The place is full o' stuff I could sell for a shillin' or two. Divin' ain't easy, you know. It's a lot o' work, and 'alf the time you don't even get nuffin'.

Mr Windibank appears to have used the back of this photograph to write out a redemption ticket. He's written it very neatly, but still. Perhaps he ran out of paper, so had to use anything he had to hand. It's hard to know what's the front and what's the reverse side now...

Wot?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm sorry to say...that I must reluctantly bid you farewell.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh? Farewell?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Tomorrow, I must begin my journey back home. To Japan. ...I fear we may never meet again.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...! Oh...right...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I've had the pleasure of meeting so many lovely people here in London. I have so many wonderful memories. And yet...as things stand now... ...it will be a glum parting indeed. Poor Iris is so miserable.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Susie...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Well...well...that ain't my business!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Both Iris and Mr Naruhodo believe you to be innocent, Gina. They've put their faith in you. But somehow...you can't find it in your heart to put your faith in them.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Yeah! That's right, I can't! ...Wot of it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It grieves me greatly to have to say goodbye to my friends when they are so clearly unhappy... ...because of you.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...! Wot, it's MY fault?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. So I have one final request, Gina, before our paths never cross again. Right here and now... ...I want you to show both of them that you don't deserve the faith they've invested in you.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Only by doing that... ...will you truly be as alone as you claim to be.

I'm after sendin' the coachman on a little errand for me, with some small change in his hand. Now then...did ye hear what I asked of him? Did ye see anythin' at all, at all?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...You asked 'im to go pop yer weasel, right?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Aye... The feen's taken me overcoat to deposit with a pawnbroker hereabouts. And I want you, lass, to take <span style="color:#E16935">the redemption ticket</span> for it. D'ye understand?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Wot? You want me to 'ave the ticket?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
That's right. And I'll come fetch it from ye later. Sometime within the next two months. Yer to hang on to it until then. Is that clear? ...And whatever ye do, don't lose it!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...Alright then.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
And in case I might happen to be delayed at all... ...yer to go to the pawn shop - Windibank's, so it is - and yer to <span style="color:#E16935">extend the loan</span> afore the two months is up. If ye forget, the article will be forfeited and any old feen could come along and buy it.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh? But, but I ain't got that kind o' brass.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Here's five pounds. ...That should be enough.
</p><p>Gina:<br />

</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Do we understand each other, lass? Don't try anytin' funny now. If you go against me...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Yeah, I get it.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Good. And one more ting... ...in a few days from now, ye'll be visited by the police, I've no doubt.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
The coppers?!
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Aye. They'll come askin' ye to take the stand in court. To testify as a witness. So let's just have a wee chat about that, shall we? What it is that ye might say... And what it is that ye won't.

Sign the representation papers for tomorrow's trial.

If you don't actually want me to represent you in court, you can rip it up later. But we need that paperwork or we can't investigate. The police won't let us.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Investigate wot?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The scene of the incident last night. Mr Sholmes was shot, you see.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
You wot?!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hurley's having a big operation right now, Ginny.

Is it bad?! Is, is 'e gonna be alright? Sholmes is gonna be alright...right?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's why I want to investigate. For Mr Sholmes's sake as much as anything.
</p><p>Gina:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Something like that. ...Miss Susato?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes! Of course! I have the representation papers here.

If I'm perfectly honest, we need to wrap this up before long. Can't afford to spend too much time on it.

Good! It works on the principle that different people have different types of blood, you see.

Oh yes. <span style="color:#E16935">A bullet hole</span>. And I can see the bullet is still lodged in the wall.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Presumably Mr Windibank wasn't practising with his revolver in his spare time.

Ah, well... ...Mr Sholmes likes to practise in his drawing room whenever he can. He's very patriotic like that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's all there in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', you know! Isn't that right, Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah...did I write something like that? Partly in jest, perhaps.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
In jest?!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, he doesn't do it often. It is quite a dangerous pastime.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He doesn't do it often? He shouldn't even do it once!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Forget that for now, Runo. Let's examine this bullet!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's that around the bullet hole? Is it...<span style="color:#E16935">blood</span>? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Hm, a suspicious red stain on the calendar...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Aha! This is where I come in!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Right... If the blood changes to be <span style="color:#E16935">the same colour</span> as the sample from the storeroom... ...we'll know that it's <span style="color:#E16935">Mr Windibank's blood</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Exactly! Here we go then!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's completely different to the colour that Mr Windibank's blood turned in the analysis.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It just goes to show...things don't always go according to plan, do they?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Nevertheless, we must add this sample to the results of the other blood analysis.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So Iris, about these two photographic prints... The one we found here on Mr Windibank's counter, and the one Gina gave us before... What is this amazing <span style="color:#E16935">secret</span> you mentioned that's hidden between these two identical prints?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Actually, that's not quite right.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
If you look carefully...the two prints <span style="color:#E16935">aren't the same</span>. Not exactly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
They're not?!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Have another look at them now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Can you see that they're just slightly different from each other?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I...I think so... <span style="color:#0070C0">(It's very subtle though...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But what's the reason for <span style="color:#E16935">the subtle difference</span> between the two prints?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah, well! It's because <span style="color:#E16935">they're a set</span>, you see!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, I don't...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
This pair of photographs... ...is meant to be used in <span style="color:#E16935">a stereoscope</span>! Everyone in London is raving about them at the moment!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ah, a stereoscope. Why do I feel as though I've heard that word before recently?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! Yes! That's what Mr Sholmes showed us yesterday! You see? There it is, just over there!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, yes, of course. That magical machine that makes pictures look almost real enough to touch!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hehehe. Well actually... ...it's quite possible to see the same depth in pictures even without one of those contraptions.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? Really?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Do you know how a pair of flat photographic prints can appear to have any depth in the first place?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No, I have no idea.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, wonderful! Then I'll be able to tell you!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She's over the moon, bless her. Should we let her explain, though? We really need to carry on investigating the scene...)</span>

<p>Iris:<br />
Have you ever considered, Runo... ...how our eyes see depth in the world around us?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...I just open them...and it works.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But the reason it works, is because we have <span style="color:#E16935">two</span> eyes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Two eyes... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Shocking...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
If you try just closing one eye at a time, I think you'll see straight away. What you see with your <span style="color:#E16935">left eye</span>... ...and what you see with your <span style="color:#E16935">right eye</span>... ...are ever so slightly different. You get a different <span style="color:#E16935">view</span> with each eye.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, <span style="color:#E16935">the position of objects</span> seems to shift slightly.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Exactly. And in your head, your brain uses that <span style="color:#E16935">shift</span> to estimate depth as it <span style="color:#E16935">merges</span> the two views into one. That's how we can sense <span style="color:#E16935">depth</span> in everything we see!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Haah...my brain really is amazing, isn't it? It does so much without telling me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah, I think I see! So <span style="color:#E16935">the pair of photographs</span>... ...consist of a <span style="color:#E16935">left eye</span> view... ...and a <span style="color:#E16935">right eye</span> view! Is that right?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, well done, Susie! You're so quick!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So, if you can persuade your brain to <span style="color:#E16935">merge</span> the two pictures together in your head... ...you'd be able to see <span style="color:#E16935">depth</span> in these prints?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, Runo! You're beginning to understand!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And a stereoscope's function is to act as your brain and allow you to do just that?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, but... ...as long as you have two images, two eyes and one brain... ...you can actually do it yourself, without needing a stereoscope at all!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You can? Really?!

Let's try it. Let's see if you can <span style="color:#E16935">view this pair of prints</span> without the help of a stereoscope!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh yes! I'm dying to have a go!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Susato-san really loves this kind of thing...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You need to be able to <span style="color:#E16935">cross your eyes</span>, that's the main thing. Can you both do that?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Cross my eyes? <span style="color:#0070C0">(I, I think I can...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Watch me and see if you can copy! Make your eyes...do this.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Alright! Let me try! Are you ready, Mr Naruhodo? There! How's that?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Wonderful! Now it's your turn, Runo.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The trick is to concentrate on looking at the bridge of your nose with both eyes at the same time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Not exactly an easy task when two people are staring at you <span style="color:#E16935">cross-eyed</span>.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Alright, that's enough practice. Now let's try it looking at the prints. Start by looking at one print and slowly crossing your eyes... You should see two overlapping images, like this. You try it now, Runo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm just going to have to give it a try, I suppose. .........)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Did the print split into two images for you? Now, the next step... ...is to put the pair of prints side by side like this, and then to try crossing your eyes again. The prints should slowly merge together... ...until... ...they form a new, <span style="color:#E16935">single image</span> in the centre.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, yeeeeeeeeesss!!! Mr Naruhodo! It works! I can see it <span style="color:#E16935">in the middle</span> now! It looks so <span style="color:#E16935">real</span>! Oh, I could look at it all day!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I...wouldn't advise that. Your eyes might start to hurt.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Your turn, Runo! Pretend you're looking through the two pictures and slowly cross your eyes... Keep adjusting the position of your eyes until the two images <span style="color:#E16935">overlap exactly</span> in the middle.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Like...this, is it? .........)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
There! You managed it! So now you know how stereoscopic images work.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well...I don't know who discovered it, but it really is quite extraordinary.

So what do you think of these stereoscopic prints then, Runo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
They're certainly amazing, but it isn't easy to get the knack of viewing them properly.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
No, some people find it easier than others. But that's why contraptions like this exist. For people who find it tricky.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! I recognise that. We saw one over there yesterday, didn't we? If I remember correctly, you press this little knob here... ...then set the pair of photographs in this stand at the back and...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's still amazing, even though I know roughly how it works now.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, London seems to agree with you. Stereoscopes are very popular at the moment. You can find one of these folding contraptions in lots of households in the capital currently.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But if these little machines are so affordable... ...surely there's no need to go around staring <span style="color:#E16935">cross-eyed</span> at pictures like you hate them.
</p><p>Iris:<br />

Ah! Look here!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh yes. <span style="color:#E16935">A bullet hole</span>. And I can see the bullet is still lodged in the wall.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Presumably Mr Windibank wasn't practising with his revolver in his spare time.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah, well... ...Mr Sholmes likes to practise in his drawing room whenever he can. He's very patriotic like that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's all there in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', you know! Isn't that right, Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah...did I write something like that? Partly in jest, perhaps.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
In jest?!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, he doesn't do it often. It is quite a dangerous pastime.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He doesn't do it often? He shouldn't even do it once!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Forget that for now, Runo. Let's examine this bullet!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's that around the bullet hole? Is it...<span style="color:#E16935">blood</span>? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Hm, a suspicious red stain on the calendar...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Aha! I may well be able to help with that!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
There's nothing like the sight of blood to get the blood pumping, is there, Runo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... I have a feeling I'm not as bloody-minded as you, Iris.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm afraid the sight of blood makes my blood run cold.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
There you have it, you see! When it comes to blood, we're all different types!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes, what a...scientific observation.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So you need this!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh no... What is that scary-looking thing?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hm...Hurley and I haven't actually come up with a name for it yet. But as soon as you see it in action, you'll understand what it does. ...Watch.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Oh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(<span style="color:#E16935">The colour</span> of the bloodstain has changed!)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
There! Does it make sense now?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...I think I'm starting to understand...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Good! It works on the principle that different people have different types of blood, you see.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes! How wonderful!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
The chemical it fires combines with the blood and makes it change colour. So you can identify whose blood it is that you're looking at in a flash!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, what a fabulous invention, Iris!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Isn't it? Isn't it? I bet Ginny would say it's 'bleedin' great'!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...whose blood are we looking at then?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
......... Well, all the chemical does is turn the blood a different colour, so... ...just find someone whose blood turns the same colour and you'll know who it belongs to...in a flash!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... It's more like two flashes, really...isn't it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
One flash or two, this could well turn out to be a very valuable clue. So we must make a note of it in the Court Record!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The blood sample has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Let's keep testing and adding the results of any other blood analysis to the portfolio!

As long as I have reagent left, sure.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

...'Thrice-Fired' Mason...?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You don't sound very sure of yourself, the way you trailed off there.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well it was two months ago now, that case. And of course I'd never met the victim. So I'm struggling to remember his name. He was definitely 'Thrice-Fired', though.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">The victim</span>...of the omnibus case? Yes, his name was indeed Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason. But that would mean that this bloodstain... ...was left on the ticket <span style="color:#E16935">two months ago</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. I think it was. Gina brought this ticket here to Windibank's yesterday. I'm suggesting that the bloodstain was already on it at that time.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So it's a smear of blood from the time that Mr Mason was killed two months ago!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Something else is coming back to me now... Mr McGilded was also wearing <span style="color:#E16935">leather gloves</span> that night.
</p>
<hr />
<p>McGilded:<br />
Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It certainly does look like a leather-gloved <span style="color:#E16935">thumbprint</span>, this mark. But we know that Mr McGilded had no injuries at the time, anywhere on his body. From which we can conclude... ...that any blood on the glove...belonged to the victim, Mr Mason!

So...whose blood are we looking at then?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
This must be Mr Windibank's blood.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. This is where he was shot, so... <span style="color:#0070C0">(...there can't be any question of that.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
This could turn out to be a very valuable clue. So we simply must make a note of it!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The blood analysis has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Let's keep testing and adding the results of any other blood analysis to the portfolio!

As long as I have reagent left, sure.

So...now we know <span style="color:#E16935">the colour</span> the chemical turns when it reacts with Mr Windibank's blood.

No. But let's add this sample to the others we've already collected, anyway.

</p><p>Iris:<br />
So, Gregsy, what do you make of the crime scene here?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Oh yes, Your Ladyship, do allow me to humbly explain! Last night at shortly after the hour of one o'clock in the mornin', Scotland Yard police attended the scene. The one and only door to this storeroom was found locked from the inside.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So it was locked from the inside...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The lock appears to be broken now, though. Was that the police officers' doing?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Quite right, ma'am, quite right. We took the liberty of smashin' the door in...as humbly as possible.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
As you can see, the victim was discovered prostrate on the floor, um...thuswise. And next to the aforementioned body, we discovered the vile gutter-child.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Are you talking about Ginny? She's my friend, you know, Inspector!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... Miss Lestrade - the hapless girl - was curled up on the floor, dead to the world.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...She's still alive, you know.)</span> Yes, when I saw her, she appeared to be unconscious.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
And I'm afraid to say...she had <span style="color:#E16935">the gun</span> that was used in her hand.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
No!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Presumably it's <span style="color:#E16935">the gun</span> that's still down there on the floor now.)</span>
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
In her pocket, we found the key to the door as well.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! The key to this storeroom?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And you say...the storeroom had been <span style="color:#E16935">locked from the inside</span>, Inspector?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Correct. All of which leaves Her Ladyship's friend... ...in somethin' of <span style="color:#E16935">a sticky situation</span>, I'm afraid.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
.........
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Obviously! ...My personal opinion is that it's all some sort of misunderstandin'!

Yes, ma'am! They used somethin' called a general anaesthetic. It's the latest thing. Renders the whole body insensitive.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The whole body...anaesthetised? Is that even possible?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
It means the operation can be completed while the patient is fast asleep.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Goodness, in the Empire of Japan, we can just manage to provide laughing gas for a tooth extraction...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
The trouble is, the latest thing isn't always the greatest thing, if you follow my meanin'. They couldn't get the medication to work at first, so it took hours for him to nod off, or so I hear. And now that the op's finished , they...they can't get him to wake up, apparently.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
No one knows if it's the anaesthetic still in his system, or if the bloke's just plain exhausted. But anyway, all they can do is stand back and watch until he comes round again.

So <span style="color:#E16935">the small box</span> will no longer be in here, then.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That's right. It's been forfeited.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Which means, it could be on the shelves in the front of the shop, where the forfeited items are offered for sale!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! The shelves in the front! We must search them at once!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
You're wastin' your time.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
There are dozens of little boxes out there. Hundreds, even. We can't possibly know which one might've been McGilded's. That information's not written in the ledger.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...

We can see now that the victim's blood is all over Mr McGilded's overcoat.

<hr />
<p>McGilded:<br />
Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand.

No. If that was what had really happened, the blood wouldn't have <span style="color:#E16935">splashed all over</span> the front of the coat.

Gina...let me say it again... Please allow me to represent you in tomorrow's trial.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh? Are you 'alf-baked?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Not at all. You've not once admitted to committing the crime, have you? What's more...I believe that you're telling me the truth.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Seriously, um...Mr Narrow-'Oddo... ...didn't you 'ear all of wot I said before? I'm a born liar. Fibs just trip off me tongue. And I'm a diver, don't forget. I pulled the wool over yer eyes two months ago and got you into all sorts o' trouble. Why would you ever trust me now? I just don't get it!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Gina...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...I do understand why you choose not to put your trust in others. But I assure you, there is more to this life than you yet realise.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Wot d'you mean?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The world we live in... ...is full of people you would do very well to trust. People who won't ever let you down.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's true that I'm just a student of law, and I'm certainly lacking in courtroom experience. But I can promise you this: Whatever happens...and until my very last breath... ...I am completely on your side!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Wot...wot d'you expect me to say to that? .........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Then it's decided. I will take these papers now and carry out the necessary preparations for tomorrow's trial. It would be a shame to throw them away now after it's been penned with your name so beautifully.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...Do wot you like. You Eastern lot are...are... I dunno wot you are! I don't get ya!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:
</p>

Susato:<br />

</p><p>Susato:<br />
Somebody is there in the shadows. I can sense it. Somebody who wasn't there before!

I s'pose you were usin' one of those mystic Japanese arts. Like the art of stealth I've heard so much about.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...If anyone was being stealthy, it was you, Inspector.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Gregsy!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Oh dear me, I am most terribly sorry, Your Ladyship! I didn't mean to startle you!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
How long have you been listening in on our conversation?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Good grief! Listenin' in?! No no no! I just got word that there were some visitors who were refusin' to leave even though it was after hours. I assure you, Your Ladyship, I only just arrived. This very minute! Not a moment earlier! That's all it is! Nothin' untoward! Nothin' at all!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
After hours...? Is it that late already?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
So then, I'll humbly excuse myself now, Your Ladyship. Ta-ta! Toodle-oo! Cheerio! All the best! Bye, by and by!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's <span style="color:#E16935">a lot of farewells</span>, and not one of them appropriate for 'Her Ladyship'.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, but I wanted to have a chat!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I'm, I'm terribly sorry, but time is pressin' at the minute.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, I see. ...That's a shame.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
If I don't get this emergency at the Supreme Court dealt with sharpish, Lord  Stronghart will, well...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Emergency?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Lord Stronghart?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Nothin'! Forget I said anythin'! Anyway...ahem! I'm off!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Alright, Gregsy, if you have to. But let's chat soon!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Delighted! Charmed! Can't wait! If you please! My pleasure!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's <span style="color:#E16935">a lot of pleasantries</span>, and not one of them sounded sincere...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Gregsy's so funny! He says such silly things!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's certainly entertaining to see an inspector of the police fawning to a ten-year-old girl. <span style="color:#0070C0">(But anyway, I wonder what this <span style="color:#E16935">emergency</span> is at the Supreme Court...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I must attend the court clerk's office now before it closes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, of course. Thank you, Miss Susato.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Kindly escort Iris home now, Mr Naruhodo. I shall meet you there later.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>And so our investigation came to an end. Susato-san went to file the necessary papers for my defence of Gina the following day. And then it hit me... I could no longer suppress the wretched feeling that had been gnawing away at my insides. Tomorrow...Susato-san would be leaving. Leaving Britain and making her way back to Japan.</center>

Naruhodo-san... ...it's been a very trying day, hasn't it? I do hope you're not too exhausted.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What about you, Susato-san? Today has been even more trying for you, I'm sure. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Mr Sholmes was shot before our eyes, Gina was arrested... ...all on the back of the news that her father has fallen ill and that she must return to Japan at once.)</span> I...hope your father recovers soon.

Thank you for your kind words. .........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Susato:<br />
I wonder why it is... ...that so many thoughts rage in my head like a storm... ...and yet I seem unable to find the words to express any of them.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I know exactly what you mean.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Anyway, I have one final task to complete as your judicial assistant. Once that is done, I shall make preparations for my departure tomorrow.

<p>Susato:<br />
It's just two months since we arrived in London. But we've managed to establish this office. It was finally feeling as though we were settling in. I would be lying...if I said I felt no regret.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm so sorry, Susato-san...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's just so sudden. I really don't know what to think. I've had no time to gather my thoughts.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I know we've only been here a short time, but... ...in my limited experience of the courtroom, I feel I've learnt something.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...And what would that be?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It seems to me...there are many facets to people's personalities.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Facets..?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And like a jewel, the light plays off them in complex patterns, illuminating their actions and their motives. But we see only see <i>[sic]</i> a small number of the total facets. And what is illuminated is only a part of the whole story.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What lies in the shadows? What do those facets we cannot see look like? Perhaps there are some parts we'll never lay eyes on, for as long as we live.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's so true.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sometimes I feel as though I'm blind to so much. But I keep hoping that one day it will all become clear. That all the facets will be illuminated, and I'll finally understand how everything fits together.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Naruhodo-san...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I suppose what matters... ...is that we keep our eyes open, and keep moving forward. Even if the way sometimes seems dark.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... It's amazing to think it's been just two months. ...You've grown so much.
