<p>Edgeworth:<br />
So now we know who the Yatagarasu really was. And yet, there remains much to this case that needs to be resolved.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Like how the weapons crossed country lines, for example. The two countries have incredibly strict security systems and entry procedures. Short of a miracle, it's impossible for someone to have smuggled them in.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Smuggling them in, huh...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(We will need to open a new line of investigation on just this aspect alone... But before we do, I would like to go through my evidence once more.)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Unnecessary evidence has been removed. Remaining evidence has been re-arranged.</span>
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Hey! There's a VCR here, sir! Now we can see what's on that tape Detective Badd gave us!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This piece of evidence from the KG-8 Incident, hidden from sight for ten long years... I just know that this is related to the current case somehow.)</span> Detective Gumshoe, if you could please play the tape for us.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Sure thing, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This man! It's Manny Coachen!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
A-And he's holding a knife in his hand!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
This looks like footage from a security camera at the entrance of an apartment building.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
An apartment building? How do you figure that?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Unlike you, I actually read the summary file on the KG-8 Incident. And the crime scene was the victim's own apartment.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So this footage was shot at the entrance to the victim's own apartment building...?)</span>
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
At the trial, Mr. Faraday claimed that the piece of footage existed.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However, no one could find it.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Yes. Somehow, someone was able to steal it and hide it through Mr. Ernest Amano.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I can see how this would've been a definitive piece, and why someone would want to hide it.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
But it's a piece of evidence from a ten-year-old case. There's no way it's related to this case we're working on now, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Actually, I believe it has everything to do with the case we're working on now. The ringleader even went so far as to use Mr. Portsman to retrieve it. Which means that in this video lies a very inconvenient bit of footage to the ringleader.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Where!? Where!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Nngh. Wait. What was that!?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That bit you played just now... Please show it to me again! This car! This is something we cannot overlook.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Why's that, sir?

</p><p>Alba:<br />
Ah, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth. So you were here all this time.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Ambassador Alba...
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Thank you very much for continuing the investigation, even at the time of night. Ah, if only I was even a tiny bit more careful... ...this tragedy would never have happened. I am truly sorry.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This wasn't your fault, sir. This had nothing to do with how careful you were.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
You idiot, Quercus! You couldn't chase after a simple thief! Now then, let's get down to the real reason why I came looking for the two of you. I would like you to put the investigation on hold for a while. Can you do that?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Excuse me!?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
I heard you've apprehended the thief that turned this embassy upside-down. And we are in the middle of an event celebrating our countries' reconciliation. We can't exactly have the police and detectives walking around here forever. You're scaring the visitors away. So I hope that you can understand how I feel.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Nngh... But we must finish our investigation and resolve the remaining issues.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Why don't we leave the rest to the Allebahstian and Babahlese police?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Ambassador! We are so close! Just a little more and...!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Ms. von Karma. I'm afraid I've made up my mind. And without my permission, you can't proceed with your investigation, anyway, right?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
That's true, however...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(As he said at the very beginning... ...this area can be considered to be Allebahstian soil. In which case, we are nothing but foreigners in their land. Is this really where our investigation ends!?)</span>

If I laid back and took a break, I'd lose the scent of my prey, Mr. Prosecutor.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Agent Lang! Why in the... Why have you returned?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Because I have to solve this case, no matter what.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Well, I'm sorry to inform you... Ah, and don't take this the wrong way; I don't suspect you personally... ...however, a member of Interpol was just found to be a thief, and so...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Grr...
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Under these circumstances, I wish to put your investigation on hold. After all, I believe our own police can handle things from here. They are quite capable.

No, not that. What I was talking about was... ...I know who the killer is behind tonight's murder!

Y-You--
</p><p>Kay:<br />
K-Know--
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
T-The--
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
K-Killer!?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
D-Do you really mean that, Agent Lang?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Heh, wolves don't lie.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Th-Then who is it!?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Well, let me first say that I'm not talking about Mr. Coachen's murder. That was all Shih-na.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Lang Zi says: "The truth lies not at the exit, but rather, shines outside the maze itself." The truth is unexpectedly simple. So let me ask you this: who do you think was DeMasque II's killer? Hmph, I'll tell you who... It was you, Franziska von Karma!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I was the killer!?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hey, wait! But that's impossible!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Y-Yeah! ...Although, that whip is actually quite... Yeowwww!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Hold your tongue, and that ludicrous remark you were about to make!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang... Are you seriously accusing her of murder?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
.........Yeah, I am.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He doesn't appear to be joking.)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hey, sis... I remember that just before Ambassador Alba went to give his speech... ...he called you into his office, right?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Y-Yes, he did... but what does that have to do with anything!?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
I'm getting to that. Furthermore, in order to solve both cases... ...you moved around rather freely between Allebahst and Babahl, did you not?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />

</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hmph... I was just getting to that. Trust me, I'll show them to you in due time. Ambassador Alba. In order for me to bring this case to a close... ...I'll need to inspect your office one more time. Will you grant me permission?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
.................. .........With things as they are, I suppose I don't have much of a choice, do I...?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Good! Then let's move out! Oh, and don't even think about running away, sis. My pack will be keeping a close eye on you, you can bet your bottom dollar on that!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Hmph! As if I would have any reason to flee! But just so we're clear, your logic had better be sound... ...because I'll accept nothing short of a perfect explanation!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She seems rather upset, not that I blame her...)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Haaa ha ha ha ha ha hahaha. I expected that you'd accept no less. But we'll see how long you can keep that nose of yours stuck up in the air like that.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Arngh...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang... As someone related to tonight's case, I request that you allow me to take part. And so that I may clean up my superior's mess.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hmph... I guess I should. The more the merrier, especially when it's the peanut gallery.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Oh! In that case, I want to join in, too! I still haven't seen what it looks like in Allebahst, yet!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
If you let Kay in, then you've gotta let me in, too, pal! I can't sit around and do nothing when Ms. von Karma's in trouble!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hey, Gummy! Let's have a competition to see who can save her first, OK!?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
OK! I'll take you up on that! Oh, yeah! I'm fired up and raring to go!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...As a detective, I don't believe this is something you're supposed to be excited over.)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Haaa ha ha ha ha ha hahaha. Sounds like this is going to got real interesting! Ambassador Alba... I'll be bringing these kids along for the ride.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
...Very well. But I'd like you to keep in mind that this will be your last chance.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hmph. I'll have this whole mess cleaned up before you know it. Now, let's go!
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">March 15, 12:53 AM<br />Allebahstian Embassy<br />Ambassador's Office</span></center>
<p>Lang:<br />
OK, now, let's first go over the facts one more time. Manny Coachen's body was found over in the secretariat's office in Babahl. The weapon that took his life was one of Allebahst's ornamental knives. And then, the body of DeMasque II, Mr. Ka-Shi Nou... ...was found here in the Allebahstian ambassador's office. Through our investigation, we found that the murder weapon was this Primidux Statue. And that this is actually Babahl's statue. This case... no matter how I look at it... Sis!

Agent Lang! Do you understand the full implications of what you are saying!?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Of course I do, sis. And I'm serious. You were on the trail of the smuggling ring, and you wanted any evidence you could find. And so, while people were distracted by the Yatagarasu's appearance, you snuck in here. That's when you two ran into each other. You and that other thief who took advantage of the confusion from the fire!

Even if all that were true, how do you explain the movement of the weapons!?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hmph... Don't worry. I plan to show that you're the culprit behind that, too. You had permission to investigate both embassies at will. With that kind of free reign, you could've easily taken the weapons across country lines. Hey now! Look, sis. I thought I already told you, I'm not messing around here.

</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Grrr...! Let's get this ridiculous circus over with already!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Franziska, you need to calm down. Because you only know the facts of the Allebahstian side of the case... ...I don't believe you can see the case as a whole, and therefore, solve it.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
What!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
But don't worry. I am taking this seriously as well, and I will prove your innocence.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
That's the only way to be... Mr. Prosecutor! But can you come up with anything else that can top my hypothesis? Of course, your explanation has to solve the mystery of the moving weapons as well.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Of course, and I will. Let us now delve into the truth behind the murder of DeMasque II.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
You do understand, don't you, Miles Edgeworth? This isn't just a confrontation against Agent Lang. If you can't figure out how the murder of DeMasque II is related to the smuggling ring... ...then it will mean the end of our investigation.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(As long as I have no good counterargument to his hypothesis... ...then the best I can do is walk this thin tightrope and see what I can do!)</span>

<p>Lang:<br />
One of Allebahst's knives was used in Babahl to murder Mr. Coachen.<br />
And the murder weapon in the killing of DeMasque II is Babahl's Primidux Statue.<br />
Somehow, these two objects were able to penetrate the two countries' impenetrable security.<br />
The only one who traversed the two countries just before and after the crimes was you.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
So as long as I can't explain how the weapons moved about, Franziska will remain a suspect?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
You got it, Mr. Prosecutor. So why don't you stop giving me a hard time. Under these circumstances, who the heck can carry a weapon across country lines!? I've worked through every possibility, but there's only one that's plausible. Your boss!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang, what I've learned from you just now is that you've lost sight of yourself.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Wh-What are you talking about!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
By focusing too intently on that which is in front of us, we become blind to the truth. Don't tell me Lang Zi never said anything to that effect?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
You prosecutor...! Who do you think you are, speaking about Lang Zi's proverbs like that!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph... I don't need his proverbs. Because MY words are all you will need to see the truth.

Was Franziska really the only person to have traveled between the two countries?

According to the guards at both doors, she is the only one to go back and forth. The sis there was in Allebahst when the Yatagarasu showed. And then, just before you guys found Mr. Coachen's body, she entered Babahl. I think we can assume that's when she brought the knife into Babahl.

Precisely. And if the two statues really were switched... ...then this means that both statues were smuggled across the border at some point. Which means that a total of three items were smuggled across the embassies!

Hah... Mr. Prosecutooooooor! You left out a very crucial bit in your explanation.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I know I did.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
She "launched it through the air"!? Hah... And how exactly did she do thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He is literally baring his fangs at me...! But he has a point. How exactly did it move through the air like that? As long as this remains unsolved, we won't be able to move any closer to the truth! Which reminds me, didn't he say this earlier...?)</span>

<p>Lang:<br />
Hey, sis... I remember that just before Ambassador Alba went to give his speech... ...he called you into his office, right?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So, just before the murder, Franziska was called here, right into this very room. If that's the case... then that may be another avenue I can pursue.)</span> Agent Lang. In order for me to answer that question... ...I will need to hear testimony from Ms. von Karma.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Oh...? What are you up to now, pretty boy?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Earlier, you mentioned something of interest to me. You said that just before the murder occurred... ...Ms. von Karma had been in this room because Ambassador Alba had called for her. And for that reason alone, you believe her to be the killer.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah, I guess I did say something like that.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
In that case, I believe it is my duty to ask her what her side of the story is.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hah! Do you really think a criminal would tell us the honest truth?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
How dare you!? As I've said numerous times, there is absolutely no proof that I am the killer! Miles Edgeworth! Don't tell me you suspect me, too!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I don't. However, I can't ignore the fact that you were in this room at one point in time. Which is why I would like to hear about your movements in this room.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Krngh!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Franziska... I feel that I still don't have enough information... ...which is why your testimony is incredibly important to the outcome of this case.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
............ Alright. So? What would you like me to talk about?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm... I'd like you to please testify to your movements in this room until the murder occurred.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hmph... Alright, let's try this your way for a change. But if what she has to say turns out to be a waste of time... ...I'll place her under arrest faster than you can howl "Nooooooooooooo!"
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph... As you wish.

I thought your duty was to fact-find anything you could about the smuggling ring?

Yes, that was my job. But upon hearing that the Yatagarasu had sent a calling card to the Embassy... ...Ambassador Alba called upon us to protect the Embassy instead. That incident seven years ago... Or have you forgotten what happened here back then?

That's right. But Ambassador Alba was here. One could hardly miss his rather large presence.

Hmm...

For the sake of being thorough, I'd like to ask you something. How did you know that Ambassador Alba was watering his plants at the windowsil?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The entrance to this room is on this side, however, the window is on the opposite side. If what you say is true, then when you entered the room, his body would've been like a wall. He would've been blocking your view of what he was doing. Isn't that not correct?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I suppose it was a bit hard to see around him. But fortunately for me Ambassador Alba is not an immovable wall.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I knocked before I entered, and as I did, he turned around to greet me... ...with a watering can in his hand. So it's only natural to believe that he was watering his plants, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I suppose.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
After his greeting, we spent a little time talking about his flowers. He had obtained them himself, and is growing them with the utmost care, you know.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Yes... The plants in this room... They are all like my children.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
The passionflowers in the flower box on the windowsill are growing beautifully, too. All four of them are in full bloom.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
! Ms. von Karma, what did you say just now?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I said that the flowers are growing beautifully. What about that statement do you not understand?

The dark shadow in this photo is clearly flying away from Babahl!

Here is what I believe happened. Ms. Yew and her mystery co-conspirator set themselves up in the two different rooms. The co-conspirator bridged the rooms by shooting the 2 ends of the wire down on 1 arrow. Then the two of them covered the statues and proceeded to transport the statues. After the switch was completed, another arrow was fired... ...carrying the other end of the wire down to Babahl, where it was to be disposed of. And to do that, Ms. Yew hid it inside the grandfather clock. Q.E.D.

The Primidux Statue can only be handled by the ambassador or the secretariat. And the replica is nothing more than a hollow shell covered in gold.

After receiving the statue containing the counterfeit plate from Shih-na... ...the ambassador had the misfortune of accidentally running into DeMasque II. Surprised by the thief, the ambassador raised the replica statue at DeMasque II, and... Then, in order to frame the Steel Samurai of murder... ...he covered the Samurai Sword in blood.

It's not good to speak with such subjectivity, you know, Agent Lang.

"Subjectivity"? My conclusion is anything but, and is the result of logic and investigation!

Sorry, sis. I didn't mean to put you through all that. I knew you were innocent from the very beginning.

You did...?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
I knew that this whole incident had been meticulously planned and prepared for. So naturally, the occupant of this room, Ambassador Alba, seemed the most suspicious. But without the ambassador's permission, we couldn't get in to take another look around!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ah, so that's why you put on this big show to accuse Franziska of the murder! Using Franziska as the bait, you were able to gain us entry and investigative rights!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah, if I hadn't done that, I doubt the ambassador would've given the OK to poke around.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
So that's what all this was about... Very well, I will forgive you. But in exchange for using me as bait... ...you will take some responsibility and help us find the truth!

Agent Lang, for giving me such a great opening... I thank you.

Heh, the evidence detectives collect combined with the logic of a prosecutor... That's just as it should be in a "prosecutor - detective team", right?

I see. The killer is indeed holding a card with the exact same design on it. But the card and the one you have... Just because they look the same, doesn't mean that they are, does it now?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ah, but there is a very easy way for me to prove that they are, in fact, one and the same. All we have to do is simply take a look at this!

</p><p>Lang:<br />
You might lose the game "this time"...? You don't get another round, Mr. Ambassador!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Is that a fact? ...Very well. I've decided to confess and admit my guilt.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
You're... going to confess?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
And I will accept whatever punishment that may come as a result.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
What the...?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Regarding the DeMasque II murder, I admit it... I did it out of self-defense.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You're claiming it was justified self-defense!?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
DeMasque II attacked me, and I felt that my life was in danger. If I hadn't done what I did, I might be the one you found dead instead of him.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Haa ha ha ha ha ha ha! What a pathetic performance!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! I'm not giving you one!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Wow, you two really know how to laugh at inappropriate times!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If you wish to claim it was justified self-defense, then we will need some evidence.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
It's always the evidence with you, isn't it? But if that's what you require, I'll provide it. That man left a mark on me when he attacked!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What!?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
I don't particularly want to show it off, but this is proof that it was in self-defense. I'm an old man, and sometimes I don't pay enough attention when I should...
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
But DeMasque II didn't have a single weapon on his body!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Hold on. It's nothing to get worked up over, because... I hid the weapon.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
You hid it?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
I'm sorry, but as you know, a murder is a murder, even if it's in self-defense. And I couldn't let it become public, seeing as how I AM an ambassador... This is the weapon you seek, my special bonsai trimming shears.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Oongh... It's covered in blood.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
He was trembling quite badly during our struggle... ...but that's when he grabbed the shears that were sitting in my office and attacked. So you see, it was an act of self-defense.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Is he right, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Since he has both a wound and the weapon that caused it, it's enough to declare it so.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Amb. Alba's Wound data jotted down in my Organizer.</span>

Stop spewing nonsense! You're trying to throw my investigation under the bus in your desperation. If you want to get real honest... ...everything in this case can be connected to you!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
The murder of DeMasque II was done in self-defense...!? In my trials, no man escapes his crime alive!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Perhaps so, if you were my opponent in court. However, there is one very important fact that I think you may have forgotten.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And what is that...? .................. A.........Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Arngh! That's what you mean! Extraterritoriality...!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
That's right. This embassy sits on what is effectively Allebahstian soil. So any trial that is to be held will be held in Allebahst. Therefore, the crime I just admitted to will never be tried in your courts.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang! What is Interpol's stance on this!?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Agents investigate. That's our job. The judgment of people who have confessed to their crime... that's the court's job.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Gnnrk!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
And I've already confessed to all of my crimes, Agent Lang. Furthermore, by the very nature of my position, I have full extraterritorial rights. These rights are effective, even on your country's soil. Therefore... ...no matter where a crime may take place, I will never stand trial in one of your courts!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
That arrogance... and your expression... That's nothing like the face of someone who is ready to accept the consequences. Don't tell me you have your own country's judicial system eating right out of your hands!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
These "crimes" you all speak so seriously of... To me, this has all been nothing more than a game. You may chase me out of this embassy with your accusations... ...but it's no big deal. Allebahst has numerous other embassies in other countries around the world. All you would accomplish is you would change the backdrop of our little game!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(These two layers of protection that extraterritoriality provides him... This is why he is one of those who cannot be brought to court!)</span>

</p><p>Kay:<br />
I wonder why?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
There are two special circumstances that surround the ambassador. First, the embassy itself has extraterritorial rights. If something happens on Allebahstian soil... ...we are unable to legally prosecute him.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Cool! It sounds like embassies are the perfect place to steal whatever you want!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...And murder DeMasque II, run a smuggling operation, and make counterfeit bills apparently.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But I thought all the counterfeiting was done by Mr. Coachen in Babahl?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, he apparently <span style="color:green"><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Coachen&#39;s counterfeiting op. - Used Babahlese Embassy&#39;s printing press and Babahlese ink to make counterfeit bills.">used the embassy's coupon printing press</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Coachen's counterfeiting op. - Used Babahlese Embassy's printing press and Babahlese ink to make counterfeit bills.)</span></span> to do it. But it's the same story over there anyway. Babahl also has extraterritorial rights. Which brings me to my next point: the ambassador's extraterritorial rights. Those rights are effective even in our own country.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Really?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No matter what happens, he can never be tried in our courts. He retains some very special rights, indeed. Basically, no matter what wrongs he may commit, we can't bring him to trial here.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So I guess we really don't stand a chance, do we?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm... We might stand a chance if we can somehow nullify either one of his special rights.

Right, so we can assume that the renovation was the cause of the plate and bills disposal. And the reason Mr. Coachen was killed as the "ringleader" of the smuggling operation. ...Based on what we know, who do you think was the one with the most to gain?

The cause of Ambassador Alba's agitation, the "rotten" treasure we may find... ...and the motive for killing Mr. Coachen... Ms. Yew said it herself that she didn't kill anyone tonight. If we were to take her words at face value... ...then the reason for the ambassador's nervousness can only be one thing. He didn't want us to discover the real circumstances under which Mr. Coachen was killed.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Then you mean, Ambassador Alba is the real killer? But I thought the two of them were friends?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Maybe they were, but what if Mr. Coachen was the one who first betrayed their friendship?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Oh, I get it! Wasn't Mr. Coachen pushing really hard for Mr. Palaeno... ...to be ambassador after the reunification?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, and that was the real reason why he wanted to steal Allebahst's Primidux Statue.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So Mr. Coachen hired DeMasque II to go steal it for him... ...but when Ambassador Alba found out what he was up to, he killed Mr. Coachen?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It is definitely a possibility at this point.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Those two really were thinking of no one but themselves. But the question now is "how did he do it?" Ambassador Alba was in Allebahst... ...but Mr. Coachen's body was discovered in Babahl, right?

Right. And that is what we must solve next.

This area is rather suspicious, don't you think?

You really think so? Because I don't see anything odd about it at all!

Nngh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess it's not related after all...)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth! If you keep doing that, Ambassador Alba is going to get away! Come on! Let's see if we can't get a hold of that treasure known as the truth!

Agreed. Let's see what we can find.

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
The only place that makes sense is here, at the Threatrum Neutralis.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
What? Here?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The goodwill event was being held here today, correct? So the only place that the both of them would have been in is here.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But if that's the case, then everything changes. The theater isn't actually Allebahstian land... ...so that wipes out one of those extraterritorial rights he has!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It makes logical sense, in which case, it is a reason for us to investigate further.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So what should we check out?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Let's see... I believe we should check the immigration records for both Allebahst and Babahl posthaste! Babahl's records should be easy to obtain, however, the problem will be Allebahst. I wonder if they would allow us to see their records, despite the order to vacate...

I have here, the security footage from both Allebahst and Babahl. You would do well to take a look at its contents.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You move fast.

A Von Karma strives to be perfect in every way! It's not in my nature to keep on retreating like this. I took the liberty of looking over the Babahl investigation reports as well. From now on, you will make no excuse to back down or say that we can't solve this case!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Nngh... I'm sorry about earlier.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
We won't be beaten. Because my cute little subordinate is going to try his very best, isn't he?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hasn't she patronized me enough already for a lifetime?)</span> So this video contains footage from Allebahst's immigration screening area?

I really hope there's something in here that we can use!

What is it this time? I thought I told you I'd only allow one question.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph... You did, but you still have yet to really answer my one question.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
What...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Until you tell us the truth... I will refuse to budge an inch from where I'm standing!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Hmph... Very well. I'll play with you just a little longer.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Of course. That is something I've understood from the start.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
...That guy's the one who... ordered my father killed, isn't he?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Yes, I believe so.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
The goal of the first Yatagarasu was the capture of the smuggling ring's leader. My father and Uncle Badd... Their legacy will live on... through me! So that's why we've just got to catch him, OK!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
We will. I promise. Now, Ambassador Alba, let's have at the truth now, shall we!?

Heh heh heh... No matter how many times you ask, my answer remains the same.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Oh? So you really had no reason to kill Mr. Coachen?

If you want to suppose I had one, then why not. I'll indulge you. After all, this is nothing more than a silly game to me.

I'm only following your hypothetical scenario to its logical conclusion. Haaa ha ha ha ha!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Looks like he's not going to admit it himself that he was in leagues with Mr. Coachen.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I suppose not. But I do know his relation to the smuggling ring, and to Mr. Coachen.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
You mean, he's the ringleader, and that Mr. Coachen was his subordinate, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Correct, but I know more than just that. Ms. von Karma, I'm sure you remember the safe in Mr. Coachen's office, correct?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Yes... The safe had two compartments to it, didn't it?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, and why do you think those stolen goods were being stored in Mr. Coachen's office? Could it be because he was trying to cheat Ambassador Alba behind his back?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
So Mr. Coachen didn't turn the goods over, but decided instead to keep them for himself? I suppose that's possible.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm, it seems to me that both men were only concerned with their own wealth and wellbeing.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Then that means that maybe <span style="color:#E16935">they didn't have a trusting relationship</span> after all.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What Ambassador Alba had to gain... I believe that is his motive for killing Mr. Coachen!

If you want to know, I believe you did have a motive to kill. It was because Mr. Coachen had betrayed you. But you had your own reason, too. Namely, you wanted to pin the smuggling all on him. Evil begets evil, and because you were trying to test each other, it turned into this mess!

</p><p>Alba:<br />
..................
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Seven years ago, he used this when he snuck into this embassy.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
...What...?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
These two pieces of evidence that hold information the Yatagarasu dug up on you... If you go home now, I won't hesitate to send it all to Allebahst, right behind you.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Little girl, get to the point.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I want you to go up against Mr. Edgeworth one more time. If you win, then I'll hand over these two pieces of evidence.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Yatagarasu...! Ever the thorn in my side.........!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kay, does that organizer really contain any information on his dirty dealings?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It's nothing case-breaking, really.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ah, then it was just a bluff.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Even if it was, we still can't let all the info my father and Uncle Badd found go to waste! Plus, just the existence of Little Thief is troublesome enough for him.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Those two pieces... Aren't they keepsakes of your father?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It's OK! I believe in Mr. Edgeworth! He'll come out on top in the end!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kay...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
When the going gets tough... someone's gotta be there to put the wind back in your sails!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
After all this time, you're still quite the feisty one. I appluad your powerful nature. I refuse to lose this, too. Ambassador Alba! You won't be returning home until you give us further testimony!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
How dare you all... Barring a person like me...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ambassador Alba, your testimony, if you please.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Gnrk............! Alright, but this is the absolute last. Then, even if you use all the power of Ambassador Palaeno's office, you won't stop me!

After that, I was in Allebahst the rest of the time, as I stated earlier.<br />

So you see, there is no time span in which I could've killed him. Wouldn't you agree?

Yes, but no matter. We can't allow this chance to escape us!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
I will warn you though, you've reached the end of my patience. Waste my time with any insane questions, and you will be punished.

Yes, as long as he is willing to admit to DeMasque II's murder, then I suppose so.

So if the only place he met the victim was at this theater... ...then when was he killed?

We know that Mr. Coachen didn't return to Babahl alive. Which means that the only time he could've been killed is when they were both there.

You can't be arrested simply because you're an ambassador? In that case, I thought I'd strip you of that title. You underestimated me, a descendant of the founder of detainment philosophy, Lang Zi. Four thousand years of deeply entrenched connections and networks around the world... ...have really paid off.

Detective Gumshoe. Is that the Steel Samurai's pushcart?

The detective's spirit that pops left me with...! I thought I'd follow my gut and go with it, sir! So, Mr. Edgeworth!? Is this worth anything to the case?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes... It just might play a major role in solving this case, Detective! <span style="color:#0070C0">(But something isn't right.

You were scheduled to make a speech in Allebahst... ...meaning it was difficult for you to make a stop in Babahl. However, what if you moved the body to Allebahst? Because it was your embassy, you could keep an eye on it, and tamper with the evidence. And then you smuggled it out of Allebahst!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
N-Noooooooo!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If I can show how you moved the body from Allebahst and Babahl... ...then I win.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
But you can't! The security between the two countries is incredibly tight!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

Miles Edgeworth... Have you figured it out? Do you know how the body was moved...!?

To be honest, I have nothing to support my hypothesis at this time. However, I don't believe I've made a mistake in my logic up to this point. Which means.........!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The two sides of this embassy are <span style="color:#E16935">mirror images</span> of each other. Which means that <span style="color:#E16935">there is also a pool at the corresponding location</span> on the Babahlese side. Mr. Coachen's body was moved into Babahl through the pool in Allebahst!

</p><p>Alba:<br />
Avoiding the topic with a vague answer like that is unbecoming of a prosecutor. If you don't mind, I'd like to see more physical proof, if you have any.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The Iron Infant is positively soaked in water. Why do you think that is? It's because he was fished of a pool, and not just any pool; it was the Babahlese one. I think it's pretty obvious at this point what must be true. The water reservoirs in the two courtyards are connected!

</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Look, I don't want to say this, but... ...it's kinda unlikely that the body just happened to have passed on through to Babahl. This guy's a doll, and he's small, so I can believe it made it, but...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang...!
</p><p>Kay:<br />

He's not. He realized a flaw in my argument, and is helping to move the logic along. <span style="color:#0070C0">(In which case......... I should return the favor and find an answer!)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
And another thing! Mr. Coachen's body was found in his office in Babahl. So what happened to his body after it was transported to the open-air stage?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph... Mr. Alba had an <span style="color:#E16935">accomplice</span> in Babahl, remember?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
You mean... Shih-na, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
With her there, you can see how it was possible to move the body up to the office.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Are you seriously claiming that she swam through the connecting pipe with the body?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
He's right. Ms. Shih-na would drown if she did that!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's hard to imagine that she swam through the connecting pipe...)</span>
</p><p>Alba:<br />
It looks like your hypothesis about how the body was moved is still only half-baked. In the end, it's all just the befuddled musings of an accusatory man. Now then, I believe you should give up and allow me passage. Because, from the start, there was no feasible method of transporting the body!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What!?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
.........Mr. Prosecutor. Recall Shih-na's movements.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Nngh.........! <span style="color:#0070C0">(What was happening in the embassy around the time Ms. Shih-na was in Babahl...?)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Get rid of the water...? Aha! That's it!)</span>

Now, I believe this time we really are done, right?

Hmph... Unfortunately for you, it's far from over, Mr. Alba!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
You are a most persistent man. Are you saying that you've thought of a way to move the body through the water?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Move the body through the water? That is completely unrelated to how it was done.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Excuse me?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The reason I say that is because... there wasn't any water there at the time!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
What do you mean, "there wasn't any water"...?

Shall I show you where the final destination of my train of logic leads!? First, Mr. Alba <span style="color:#E16935">closed</span> the fountain spouts in advance, in preparation of things to come. Then, he took the pushcart that was brought to the rose garden... and pushed it, along with the Iron Infant and Mr. Coachen's body, into the pool. At this time, Ms. Shih-na was busy conveniently starting the first fire in Babahl. She then made for the open-air stage's pool to wait for the fire fighting effort to begin. When the firefighters used the water in that pool, the water level went down... ...and by the time the fire was put out, the pipe between the two pools was exposed! This is when she pushed the pushcart from Allebahst into Babahl. Once that was accomplished, Mr. Alba simply opened the fountain spouts once more... ...and the water level rose up to its original level, along with Ms. Shih-na and the body. After that, Ms. Shih-na used the pushcart to carry the body up to the secretariat's office. There is an elevator in the embassy, after all. So you see... ...even with her small frame, she could've easily transported Mr. Coachen's body. And that wraps up my thorough explanation of how the body was moved!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Gnnn... Gnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooo!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph. Well, <span style="color:#E16935">Ex-Ambassador</span> Alba? What do you think? Not so untouchable without your precious extraterritorial rights to protect you, are you?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I knew you could do it, Mr. Edgeworth! Way to fight back!

</p><p>Alba:<br />
You accuse me of moving the body across country lines...! But when you get down to the nitty-gritty, you don't have what it takes to indict me!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
The "nitty-gritty"...? What does the old man want now?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Proof... I believe is what he seeks.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Yes. Proof. Without any, who is to say whether or not any of what you said really happened?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
He wants proof? What are we going to do, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
There is no need to worry. I've had all the proof we need all along. <span style="color:#0070C0">(The body wasn't the only thing to do through the pools' connecting pipe tonight. Just as Detective Gumshoe found the pushcart in the open-air stage area... ...so, too, did I find one other item there.

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Let us take a good look at the murder weapon that was used to kill Manny Coachen. On the handle of this knife, there is a beautifully blooming flower. However, it would appear that <span style="color:#E16935">it's missing a single petal</span>.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Gnn...nnrrgh...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Now, let's see what happens when we try to fit this "pick" in that open slot.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It's a perfect fit!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I assume that the petal must have fallen off of the flower during Mr. Coachen's murder. And then, it was accidentally placed into the pushcart along with Mr. Coachen's body.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph. Oh, I assure you it's more than just a story. Because for some odd reason, this flower petal was wet when I found it.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
It was wet... you say...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, and the only place it could've gotten wet from is the open-air stage's pool! Now I ask you, how did a part of the weapon which was smuggled into the theater... ...wind up in the open-air stage area on the Babahlese side of the embassy? I don't think I need to waste any words explaining this, as this petal explains it all for me. It proves that someone went from the rose garden's pool on through into Babahl!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Impossible!!!

The people of Zheng Fa have been waiting to see you, face to face, Mr. Alba. I'll tell everyone back home we'll be there soon. You should be happy.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
I... This... Why!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Why? It's a little late to be asking that question. You should've known from the very beginning... ...when you took your first life! No matter how you may plot, or how you may try to cover it all up... ...you can never hide from your crime and what you've done. Because we're here to see to it that justice is served to people like you.

Miles Edgeworth, don't allow yourself to be riled up by him at this important juncture.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Nngh... I wasn't planning to let him...
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Well, if you ask me, I think I'M the biggest Steel Samurai expert around here! And didn't you think the climactic scene of today's show was just totally awesome!?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Yes, I remember that well. And that spectacular special move! The way you delivered the final blow against the Evil Magistrate, "Early Summer Rain Jab"... Oh, that scene will live on in my heart forever.
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Is that how it went? Heh, I totally forgot about that!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
How can you forget your own special moves!? That's the special attack that the Steel Samurai uses when he's using the Samurai Spear.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Yes, and today was the first time they showed it off, was it not? If I hadn't watched the show, then how could I answer you with the name of the move?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I suppose you are correct, but if you could, please elaborate on this point for me.

"Early Summer Rain Jab" was a move that was to be unveiled today.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
And because I saw that brand new special move, I believe it confirms my alibi.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
How sad. The only way he's got to protect himself is that he watched the Steel Samurai. I guess... this guy really has nothing else left...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, and to avoid arrest, you can bet he'll say or do anything. But, with all of us here, there will be no escape for him!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Yeah! We'll find a way to bring him to justice!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Now then, let us continue with your testimony, Mr. Alba.

Hmph. Very well. The Steel Samurai's special move and the various other scenes...

You may act all surprised, but naturally, you remember this line, don't you?

.........! Of course I do. I just now understand how the Evil Magistrate felt, that's all.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Then allow me to make you identify with the Evil Magistrate some more!

Hey, then that makes you the Steel Samurai, huh?

</p><p>Alba:<br />
You little irritating gnat. Do you think you can trip me up by asking the same question over and over?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That was not my intention. Your testimony is more than sufficient. However, I believe it would be wise for you to take a look at this.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
The Samurai Spear? What about it?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This spear... actually never made it on-stage today.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
...E-Excuse me...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh... Unfortunately for you, tonight's Steel Samurai... ...happened to be a goof of a young man with an abundance of useless hot-bloodness.
</p><p>Larry:<br />
?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Having said that, said useless man bent the spear during his rehearsal this evening. Kay, do you remember what the Steel Samurai's special move was tonight?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It was the "<span style="color:#E16935">Steel Samurai Sushi Slash</span>"!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
...A...Aaaaaa...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Correct. Because he couldn't use the spear, a last-minute change was made. Had you been watching the show, you would've known the move that WAS used.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
...Gnrk...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Quercus Alba! You didn't watch even a single minute of the Steel Samurai stage show tonight, did you!?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
G.........Gnnnn... Gnnnnraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Aha! So if he wasn't watching the show tonight...
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...Then it opens up the possibility that he was busy killing Mr. Coachen instead!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
..................
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So where were you during the show? I demand an answer, now!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
..................Heh. Heh heh heh heh heh......... Ahaaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Just what is so funny!?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
You're so sloppy. And so are your conclusions. I still insist that I watched the show. Or most of it, in any case.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What do you mean by "most of it"...?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Ah, you see, during the show, I left my seat for a spell to visit the bathroom. I assume that was when that dramatic scene was played out on-stage.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Th-That is the lousiest, lamest excuse I've ever heard in my life, pal!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Arngh! Just because he got the name of the move wrong... ...we can't really use that as proof that he didn't watch the show at all!

I will never acknowledge you as the true Steel Samurai!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
What are you getting so worked up over, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
It appears that the real Steel Samurai recognizes me as a fan. As well he should, for I am a fan! It's not as though I missed the entire show. It was a most amazing show, filled with the spirit of the young and the young at heart.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hmph. The sarcasm dripping from his long, wooden nose couldn't run any ticker.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Getting the name of the move wrong only proves that he didn't watch the last scene. What I really need here is something more definitive! Something that links Mr. Alba directly to the murder of Mr. Manny Coachen!)</span>
</p><p>Larry:<br />
You know what, gramps? You're really something else!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
I'm honored to receive such praise from the Steel Samurai, but what is it for?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Well, I was just wondering how you found out about the "Early Summer Rain Jab". That move is a bit of a secret that only a small portion of the staff know about.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Wait, it was a secret...?)</span> Larry! Wait, what did you just say!?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Huh? Did I say something stupid again?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Did you say that the "Early Summer Rain Jab" was actually a secret...?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Well, maybe I shouldn't have said "secret"... It's more like we only decided on the name of the move right before the start of the show.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Right before?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Yeah! The stage director was going nuts because we were supposed to debut the move! About 5 minutes before the show, we threw it up on the dressing room's white board. "Early Summer Rain Jab"! That's kinda how we decided the name of the move. But, by that time, I'd already bent the spear, so I guess the whole thing was kinda pointless.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
All of you Steel Samurai actors are the same. The director has my complete sympathy.
</p><p>Larry:<br />
So basically, because we changed the move to the Sushi Slash... ...we kinda pretended that the Early Summer Rain Jab didn't exist at all! I mean, it'd be had if someone found out we'd changed the move, so we made it a secret.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So basically, a gag order was issued for publicity's sake...)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It almost makes the "Early Summer Rain Jab" sound like a lost art!
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Yeah, which is why I think most of the staff haven't even heard of the move.

Mr. Alba. I believe the one who should be quiet now is you.
</p><p>Alba:<br />

I suspect that you've already noticed... ...exactly what the very severe implications are in this man's testimony!

Don't even think about trying to slither your way out of this, Quercus Alba.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You were the one who said it yourself, that the name of the move was... ..."Early Summer Rain Jab". But that name was only decided upon right before the show was about to start.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
So? Just what are you driving at?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
That the name of the move you told us was never used in the show or said aloud!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
............

</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
But what's the big deal, sir? I don't see what that means!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
There is another piece of evidence that has a great deal to do with the <span style="color:#E16935">dressing room</span>. So we can't afford to let this slide! <span style="color:green">This is related to both the dressing room and to Mr. Coachen's murder!</span>

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
There is a very close connection between this and the dressing room!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
And what sort of connection would that be?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It's... a bit difficult to recognize at first glance, however...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! I only trust what I can see! And when it comes to evidence, I think everyone here agrees with me!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Grr... It would appear that this piece of evidence was not what I was looking for.)</span> Yes, well, this time I will present to you the real piece that will prove my point.

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
The pushcart that was used to move the body was right there in the dressing room! During the show, the pushcart awaited its turn to be pushed on-stage in the dressing room. And it was finally pushed there, along with the Iron Infant, in the last scene of the show. And then, right after the show ended, it went into Allebahst along with the Steel Samurai. Which means that the only time the killer could've placed the body inside the pushcart was... ...when the pushcart was in the dressing room backstage!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So basically, the killer has to be someone who visited the dressing room during the show!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Precisely.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
.........Gnnraaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Oh! But wait! What if, and this is just a "what if"...! What if the murder didn't take place in the dressing room?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Wh-What do you mean, Kay!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I have to admit, she brings up a valid possibility. During the show, the dressing room was supposed to be devoid of people.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Anyone going into the private dressing room would stand out like a sore thumb!
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
But despite that, the killer still managed to move the body with the pushcart.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Correct, and it is because of the set-up of the theater's dressing room... ...that it would be the ideal location for the murder of Manny Coachen!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
..................
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Quercus Alba! During the show, you went down to the dressing room. And I want to know why!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
..................Yes. .........Yes, I was there. I went into... the dressing room.

I knew it! I'm placing you under arrest right now, pal! You got that!? ARREST!

Not so fast.

Wh-What is it now!?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Heh heh heh heh. Don't I deserve a chance to explain myself?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Explain? What is there to explain!?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
I believe I told you earlier that I went to the bathroom. Well, I got lost when I did. I wanted to ask for directions but when I opened the dressing room door, no one was inside. And that's when I saw the name of the move on the white board.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
You punk! Still trying to get out of this...!?

...We don't need to do any of that.

What!? Wolfy!? How could you!?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
I'm not saying this to be mean. It's just that... we've already searched there. My men really are something else.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
And they found nothing?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
There's only one thing I can say to you, sis, and it's that they found nothing. That's it.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I... guess you're right. If they had found something, they would've reported it to us.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Heh heh heh heh heh. They couldn't find anything because there was nothing there to find.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
And if there is no info to feed into Little Thief, then I can't do much to help either.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is this the end? The murder took place in this theater, which is not protected under extraterritorial rights... ...and the fact that it was Mr. Alba himself who committed the murder...

It would appear that your hand of cards has turned out to be a bust. Now if you will excuse me. Because of you people, I missed my flight. Now I must make haste to arrange for a new one...

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why did you have to speak up right at this instant...!?)</span>
</p><p>Oldbag:<br />
But you know what, Edgey-poo!? Cheer up! Because I'm about to give you the most wonderful thing!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Oldbag:<br />
It's so super <span style="color:#E16935">special</span> that I couldn't give it away to just anyone, you know! Ah, my special present of love to my sweet Edgey-poo... Are you ready!? ...Is this!

...Why did everyone get so quiet all of a sudden!? Edgey-poooooooo! Tell me YOU understand the depths of this lady's love for you!!! I'm not one to hand out snacks willy-nilly, you know! No sir! The thought occurred to me that maybe it would be good if I fed you and made sure you were nice and full! One day, it's my dream to serve you some of my own home-made food! I mean, isn't it the desire of every woman to make sure that their beloved never goes hungry? And that's what I wanted to experience! I'll tell you one thing, though. A long time ago, they used to say that I could make the most delicious meal out of any ingredient you threw in front of me! Oh, I was a star in the kitchen back then, and I was

Mr. Edgeworth! Can't you do anything about her!?

</p><p>Oldbag:<br />
But I'm so sick and tired of it! All you people do is look down on me! Even this box of "Samurai Dogs" played me for a fool! It had a special design on its fan, like the <span style="color:#E16935">Japanese flag</span>, so I thought it was special! But when I ate one, it tasted just like all the rest! Ooh, it made me so mad!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Wait, a special box with a <span style="color:#E16935">Hinomaru</span>-like fan on it? I've never heard of such a piece of merchandise existing before. However, there it is The <span style="color:#E16935">red rising sun</span> on this fan is filled in... I-Is it possible!? Could it be...!?)</span>
</p>

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
After the show, the Samurai Dogs were piled up on the dressing room floor. However, there is no such thing as a "<span style="color:green"><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Rising Sun Dogs - Taken from the dressing room, the fan&#39;s rising sun is filled in for some reason.">Rising Sun Dog</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Rising Sun Dogs - Taken from the dressing room, the fan's rising sun is filled in for some reason.)</span></span>". This contradiction of facts between something that should not exist, and yet does... The rays from this rising sun may be just what we needed to point us in the right direction!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Franziska:<br />
A present...?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
The studio big-wigs basically told us to play delivery boys. We were supposed to hand the Dogs off to the embassy people and tell them "hi". I had to <span style="color:green"><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Samurai Dogs - Boxes of Samurai Dogs were sitting in the pushcart.">pile them all into the pushcart just to move them</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Samurai Dogs - Boxes of Samurai Dogs were sitting in the pushcart.)</span></span> all!

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
I believe you understand what this means, correct? <span style="color:green">You killed Mr. Coachen</span> at this theater, <span style="color:green"><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Body in the pushcart - The killer placed Coachen&#39;s body in the pushcart in the dressing room.">and then placed his body inside the pushcart</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Body in the pushcart - The killer placed Coachen's body in the pushcart in the dressing room.)</span></span>. And then... ...you forced to Steel Samurai to unwittingly move the body for you!

It's time to piece the final pieces of this logic puzzle together. No matter how fragile or small the connections may be... ...once we've found them all, the way to the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> will be revealed!

Huh!?

Blood, you say...!?

<p>Kay:<br />
But why was there blood on that box to begin with?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If we think about the flow of the crime, I think the reason will become obvious. Larry, you said that you transported the "Samurai Dogs" with the pushcart, correct?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Oh, umm, yeah! You have a great memory, Edgey! That pushcart was a bit too big for my son, you know what I mean? So to make sure everyone could see him, I had to pile some stuff in. I figured the Samurai Dogs were there, so I used them to fill up the cart.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If what Larry says is true, then what were the boxes doing on the floor?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Ah, I see. The killer took them out in order to place the body in the pushcart!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Exactly. And that is when I believe the victim's blood found its way onto that box.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
But when my men investigated that room, not a single box of Samurai Dogs was in there... ...because embassy staff members had already confiscated them.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. No doubt to hide the evidence of the murder.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It's a good thing Ms. Oldbag <span style="color:#E16935">managed to steal</span> that one box before they got to them, huh? Looks like Ms. Oldbag also managed to put this Great Thief to shame!

Y-Y-Yes, siiir! Th-That blood I mentioned... It's not of the same blood type as the victim's blood!

Heheheheheheheh. My, what an amusing turn of events!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Alba:<br />
That blood drop proved something to be true alright -- namely, my words.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And which one of your words would that be?
</p><p>Alba:<br />
The ones where I said that your words are meaningless, worthless, and powerless. That blood has nothing to do with the murder investigation whatsoever! Need I remind you that the blood got onto that box long before it entered my embassy?

The blood doesn't belong to anyone connected to the case. That should be clue enough.

Quercus Alba! You BASTARD!

Alba! It doesn't matter where you run off to, you'll never escape me! Someday, I'll have the satisfaction of sinking my fangs into you. You'll see! And all of Interpol will be behind me, working to see to it that that day comes!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Heh heh heh heh. Do you know what your words sound like to me? They sound like the whinings of a pathetic loser of a mutt.

Arroooooooooooooooooooo!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is this really the extent of all that we can do? Is the blood really from someone completely unrelated to the case? Or is there another possibility?

What would he who can turn any desperate situation around do...? .........<span style="color:#E16935">Turn it around</span>...? That's it! I must turn my way of thinking around!

</p><p>Alba:<br />
Well, I must praise you for trying so hard. It's because of you kids that I was removed from center stage. ...and will be forced to live out the rest of my life in the shadows, unfortunately. But it's not a total loss, as the underworld will allow me more freedom than you'll ever know. Freedom like what the raven feels as it flies through the dark night sky. You can't lay a finger on me, not now or ever. The arm of the law is powerless before me!

Allow me to describe you in one word: pitiful.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Pitiful...? How so?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Quercus Alba! Your wings were clipped long ago.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
.........!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And for someone who is trying to fly away on them without noticing that fact... ..."pitiful" is the perfect word to describe you!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Hah! Mere words!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
What do you mean by "his wings are clipped", Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Just what you think it means, Kay. We had already caught him in our trap a while back. With an incredibly powerful, definitive piece of evidence!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hey, hey! Earth to Mr. Prosecutor! Care to speak in English!? What are you talking about? What piece of evidence?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The piece I speak of is of course... this drop of blood.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
But we know that it's not from the victim! I don't see how it remains relevant to the case at all!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ms. von Karma... I believe that is exactly why it's very important to the case. And the part that is the most important is the fact that it's not the victim's blood!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
............!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You're looking a little pale. Good, then I believe you are already aware of what I mean.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Then, you know who the blood belongs to!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph. Of course I do. This piece of evidence is the <span style="color:#E16935">irrefutable proof</span> that will stop the killer in his tracks. <span style="color:green">The blood that soiled this box of Samurai Dogs belongs to this person!</span>

Yes, and that person is the murderer himself. That's the only logical conclusion.

Using this, Mr. Coachen was able to bring a weapon into the Theatrum Neutralis!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Oh, really? Would you care to show me exactly how he did it using that?

Th-That's... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Curses. I can't think of a single way to use this...)</span>

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Among law enforcement, this piece is known as the <span style="color:#E16935">Yatagarasu's Key</span>.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
Th-That key...!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That's the key that my father stole from here seven years ago...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And it is very unique, in that it is both a key and a knife. Meaning that under the guise of a key, it could've been easily brought into the theater!
</p><p>Alba:<br />
...Gnnrooooooooooooo!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You couldn't dispose of the knife that stabbed you... ...therefore, you wiped off the blood, and placed it back in Mr. Coachen's pocket! After all, the key itself opens the safe in his office. And inside that safe, there was <span style="color:#E16935">a document about Cohdopian paper</span>, signed by Mr. Coachen. In order to make it look like Mr. Coachen died as the leader of the smuggling ring... ...you had to make it so that the police were the ones who opened that office safe! Hmph. All that hard work to save yourself only served to destroy you in the end. Shall we try matching this knife's blade with your wound, Mr. Quercus Alba? ...And that is what some may call, the coup de grâce.
</p><p>Alba:<br />
............I-Impossible... You... You can't take me down! Swine! All of you! Especially Manny Coachen!!! This is all because of that man's betrayal! He sought to steal control of the smuggling ring from me by removing me as ambassador! Which is why he deserved to die while bearing the guilt for all of my crimes for me! That's why I sent out the Yatagarasu's card, and how this incident was born! Manny was supposed to be the smuggling ring's leader who was killed by the Yatagarasu! But! I had... yet another reason, yet another story that was supposed to play out! Manny's death was supposed to bring everything to a close! And I would've gotten away with it too if it wasn't for you meddling prosecutors!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Mr. Alba, I'm afraid there is one more question I forgot to ask.........
</p><p>Alba:<br />
..................
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This country's, or Allebahst's: which country's court would you like to face first? Either way, it's game over for you.

<p>Gumshoe:<br />
Whew! This is it, the big day! It's Mr. Alba's trial today!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And next week, he's scheduled to stand trial in his own country of Allebahst. Franziska is heading that one. I suspect she'll be serving a full course of whip lashes at it.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Having to face Ms. von Karma in court right after facing you, sir... *shudder* I don't even WANT to think of what that would be like. I caught a glimpse of Mr. Alba as he was being escorted into the courthouse... ...and boy, he looked about as glum as I do the day before I get my monthly paycheck! You know, I've been thinking... ...that flight attendant, and even Mr. Portsman were all Mr. Alba's secret agents.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Correct. That smuggling ring was the common thread between all of the incidents. Cammy Meele was to provide support during smuggling ops, using her job as an attendant. And Mr. Portsman was to manipulate trials related to the ring to end in their favor.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Oorrgh... iFly Airlines, and even the Prosecutor's Office... No one was safe from the smuggling ring, huh, sir!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I suspect there are even more members of this ring spread throughout the world.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yeah... It sounds like such a big op that I can't even begin to imagine what it's like! ..................
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hm? What is it, Detective?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Ah! Nothing! It's just... Well, come to think of it... ...Mr. Ernest Amano's trial is also scheduled for later today, sir...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm aware of that... Mr. Amano has been working with the smuggling ring now for over ten years. He used the Amano Group's various connections world-wide to assist the ring. But all of that has come to an end as his conglomerate is now undergoing harsh scrutiny. I owe Mr. Amano a debt of gratitude, but he must pay his debt to society.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Well, with the arrests of both Mr. Alba and Mr. Amano... ...I guess that about wraps up the KG-8 Incident as well, huh?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I suppose so. The real killer in the KG-8 Incident ten years ago was Manny Coachen. And seven years ago, the killer in the second KG-8 Incident was Mack Rell. Those two facts are the unshakable truth, however... ...it seems that a lot of effort was put into hiding these and other truths from us. And I will expose it all at the trials today.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
You're solving cases left and right today, aren't you, sir!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Cece Yew and Deid Mann... Perhaps now, these two brave souls who tried to make the truth known can rest in peace.)</span> ...By the way, I received some gifts from Ambassador Palaeno. Shrimp, crab, beef... I don't need any of these, so I'm giving them to you.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
What!? Seriously, sir!? W-Wait... Actually, I don't think I want them anymore... The way you're holding them... Don't tell me they're just coupons, sir...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Detective Gumshoe, have you not read the paper recently? Ever since the two countries became Cohdopia again, its economy has changed.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Really?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And it seems that Ambassador Palaeno has reaped a few benefits of his own from it. He has been announced as the official ambassador of the newly re-unified Cohdopia.
</p><p>???:<br />
Ah, but what a pity... Even though every item he sent is a "treasure", you don't seem all that interested. Well, if you don't want them... I can give them to my lovely assistant, Kay!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
W-Wait! That's not what I said! So, umm, Mr. Edgeworth! Please let me have them, sir! Actually, come to think of it, where is Kay? How come she's still not here?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hey! You've gotta be more alert than that!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Eek!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I can't believe you didn't notice I was even mimicking Mr. Edgeworth's voice for a bit!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
I totally didn't notice you, or realize that voice was you!

<p>Lang:<br />
Lang Zi says: "Ferocious love blooms with each new Spring."
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang... A pleasant surprise to see you here.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
It's been a long time since I set foot in a courthouse. But I wasn't going to miss... ...watching the guy who screwed up my country finally get what's coming to him. Well, that and something else. I want to see you in action in court.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Is that so, Agent Lang?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
We flushed out all of the counterfeit bills, so Zheng Fa is finally at peace again. And it's all thanks to you, so I just want to say... thanks.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Wow, I never thought I'd see the day ol' Wolfy says thanks to Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I should be the one thanking you, Agent Lang. If you hadn't negated Mr. Alba's extraterritorial rights... ...I would not have been able to bring him to trial. I believe the victory belongs to the both of us in this case.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
..................Tch. A shared victory, huh? Look, don't get me wrong; I'll still never forgive you prosecutors... ...and I have zero interest in that "<span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>" thing you talk about in court. I've always done things my own way, and that's not about to change, you got that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph, I see... Well, I believe you should follow your own creed when you do your job.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah, and if there's ever someone your precious "truth" can't catch... ...feel free to sit around and cry about it all you want. But as for me, I'm going to get that person no matter what!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh... Alright. It's about time for the trial to start. I will see you later.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
I'll be watching your performance from the gallery. I'm looking forward to this.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
I prepared a whole ton of ticker tape for today's victory, sir!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I'll help throw some around when Mr. Edgeworth wins!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Ha ha ha. Hope you've get enough, because I'm going to go call my men up as well!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...A modest amount of ticker tape goes a long way!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
The scene shifts to the courtroom, and the final act of this long tale begins. "The Legend of the Great Thief Yatagarasu". It's the story of those who chose to dedicate their lives to the pursuit of the truth. "Prosecutors are those who seek a guilty verdict for the defendants they meet... ...and to that end, you have no choice but to win by any means necessary." That creed was forced on me since I was very young... ...however, I no longer think that is all we prosecutors are. And that is because...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Even though I've only been away from the courtroom for a short time... ...I feel as though... it's been a lifetime since I've set foot in one. And today, more than any other day, I feel the fight within me rising...)</span>

<hr />
<p>Teneiro:<br />
I am really in Mr. Edgeworth's debt for the other day! Thanks to him, I'm still free to serve in the friendly blue skies. Oh, so about my suitcases... ...I've been selling them on the internet, and they've become a real sensation! Thanks to the praise the art world has lavished on my work as being truly post-modern... ...the airline has chosen me to design their new line of iFly jumbo jets! Just think! Someday, you will be able to take a ride in my pink-walled, yellow-seated jet!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Lablanc:<br />
Edgeworth? Ah, that rudeness of a rude man! Hmph! Because of him, my time and money is wasted. But more importantlier! I received a most fantastic treasure mostly! The Primidux Statue of the Principality of Cohdopia! It weights a bit light in my hands, but the Ambassador Palaeno was most generous.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Franziska:<br />
We finally caught Agent Hicks's killer, and I was able to witness Mr. Alba's teary eyes. It feels good to finally bring everything to a close. I received another offer from Interpol to work another case in cooperation with them... ...however, the Cohdopian courts await. Cohdopia's air is supposed to be very fresh, so my whip should find new vigor there.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Meekins:<br />
This little patrolman has been fired as of today, sir! I thought I was safe since we found the gun I had dropped... ...but I hadn't noticed that I had dropped my police badge, too! I guess what really broke the camel's back was that I couldn't find my badge. My little life has suddenly tripped into a dark, black hole, sir! I think I'll go the courthouse and file a complaint with Ruffles Man!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ema:<br />
I was actually hoping to talk with Mr. Edgeworth a bit more than I did... But I've got to get going and return to Europe. I've still got a long way to go and a lot of stuff to study there! Next time I help Mr. Edgeworth on a case, I'm going to do it as a real forensic scientist! I'm sure he's going to need all the help I can give him, scientifically!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Paups:<br />
Because the kidnapping was staged, I was let off easy... ...but I won't be going outside much any time soon, but that's... really OK. The only prison I'm forever trapped in is the cage of love. The guard down at the detention center... well, when he's on guard duty... ...he has such a cold look in his eyes, just like that prosecutor... *ba-dump* Ah! Stop it, Lauren! When will you ever learn to stop being a prisoner of love...?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
It appears there are all sorts of drama that takes place outside of the courtroom. Since we judges are here day in and day out, I've only heard a few rumors, but... ...apparently, Mr. Edgeworth teamed up with a thief, and became a detective. Maybe I should team up with a bailiff and try to become a lawyer or something...?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Byrde:<br />
Whew! I barely escaped death yet again!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yeah, but boy were we lucky to have Mr. Edgeworth help us out, huh!?
</p><p>Byrde:<br />
Yeah... but because I lost the key, I got fired from my security guard job.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Don't let it get you down, Maggey! You've still got me!
</p><p>Byrde:<br />
You're right, sir! I won't be sad! I'm going to pick myself up and get through this! I wonder what my next job should be...? Ooh, this is actually kind of fun!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Palaeno:<br />
Why not come to Cohdopia for your Summer vacation!? We have coupons aplenty! Right now, our embassy is proud to present our "Let's Investigate a Murder!" show. Although, recreating that particular case has created a few small fires of its own. Then we had a few problems with the fire marshals... but the next event will be great! It will be an attraction entitled, "Capture the Yatagarasu!" Of course, I hope to enlist Kay's help in creating our latest attraction!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Larry:<br />
I can't believe that Mindy ditched me and went to Japan... But it's OK! Because that's how I met Miharu! We're planning to go to Paris soon, and start a business! We're going to sell "Blue Ocean Dogs"! They'll sell like hot-cake hot dogs for sure! A blue hot dog in a blue bun, I guarantee it'll turn your tongue, and your face blue! I know I'm not really the type to work a lot, or at all really, but... Oh, so I noticed that I really haven't seen the guy in the blue suit at all recently. I wonder what's up? Well, the next time we meet, I'm gonna make him eat one of my Dogs!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Badd:<br />
Today I gave testimony in court today... as a member of the Yatagarasu...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yo, Mr. Badd! You look well, all things considered. By the way, have you noticed that elements within the ring have begun moving?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
They're probably fighting over who should succeed... over who should be the next boss... .........Although, to be honest, I wish I could forget I'd ever heard of that smuggling ring.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Lang Zi says: "Thoroughly bite the poisonous snake from head to tail!" No one runs afoul of the law and escapes this wolf's fangs! I'll get you all yet!
</p><p>Badd:<br />
.........Ah, youth. When did I become so old, I wonder...? I've begun noticing the gray hairs in my beard more. I'm thinking of retiring my mirror...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Oldbag:<br />
I was the Pink Princess and the Pink Badger, all in the span of two days! Talk about busy! But it's alright, because I got a letter from my beloved Edgey-poo. "Please take care of your hip, and when you wish to speak, first take off your headpiece." ...What does he mean by that last statement!? It's not like I enjoy being under a head piece every time I see him! I've been an alien, and then some creepy, fuzzy, pink animal, and then I was the Pink Princess, a great hero of justice! But ever since I was a young maiden, I could be spotted wearing the most stylish hat on my head, although right around now, maybe it'd be more preferable to wear my own costume or something, but even that just sounds like a terrible idea...

<center><span style="color:green">March 17, 4:33 PM<br />High Prosecutors' Offices<br />Room 1202</span></center>
<p>Gumshoe:<br />
Whooooop! I feel so much better now that the trial's over! And as always, your legal prowess was top-notch, sir!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Yeah, and nothing beat the look on Mr. Alba's face when you revealed the ring's secrets! I was amazed! You're like a totally different person when you step into a courtroom!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth is always ten times fiercer in court!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Based on the information Mr. Alba offered up, they've begun large scale operations... ...to clean up the rest of the ring, which I'm happy to leave to Franziska and Agent Lang.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
So, what are your plans now, Kay?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hm? Oh, well, we've taken care of the creep who killed my father, so I'm not sure... Hey! I know! Maybe I'll just keep on being Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Are you still trying to steal my job, pal!?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Just kidding, just kidding! I can't steal something so important to you, Gummy!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Phew, what a relief!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Kay?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Even after all that's happened, are you still planning to become a Great Thief?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Of course! But I don't want to tarnish the legend of the noble Yatagarasu... ...so I'm going to hold off on doing anything until I make a tight 3-person team of my own!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
A three-person team...?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
A three-person team of young beauties the same age as me, if possible!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...With those criteria, I highly doubt you'll find the two other people you need.)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
My father chose to fight for the truth. I think that's what was so noble about him. So you see, Mr. Edgeworth... ...the only things I will ever steal... are the truths that have been hidden away. I'm going to work extra hard to make a world where the Yatagarasu isn't needed!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph... Let's both strive for such a future.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Well, I guess it's time for me to get going.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I see.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Kay! Keep your chin up and stay strong, OK!? And don't be a stranger!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Don't be worry! I'll be back! I'll be sure to break the lock on the window and sneak in!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If you could, I'd appreciate it if you came in through the building's front door...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
It's OK, Mr. Edgeworth! The lock on my window at home has been broken for forever!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Oh! One last thing before I go! Let's take a group picture, just the three of us!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yeah, a commemorative photo! Every big case has to end with one!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
..................No.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hey! Why not!?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Don't tell me you're camera shy, Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
O-Of course not, Detective!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm taking the picture now! Hey! Come back here!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth! You can't run away from this, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ack! Hey! Detective Gumshoe! S-Stop that! I can't be seen doing... that!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
OK! I'm totally taking it now! Say, "cheeeeeeeeeese!"
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
And thus, the long tale of the KG-8 Incident came to a close. It saw the demise of a smuggling ring and the birth of a little Great Thief. But there is little time to rest and relax... ...for I am eager to tackle the investigation into a new case. The reason for my eagerness is... ...my want to pursue the truth, and... ...my want to believe in the strength of those who use the power of the law for good. As someone who has chosen to live my life as a prosecutor... ...that is my new creed.

Lang Zi says: "Confidence is like a soul, and words without confidence are but empty shells." You shouldn't waste your breath on words you have no confidence in, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, it's just as bad to say something in full confidence and be wrong!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Arghn!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Are you going to let him lecture you about your self-confidence like that!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
