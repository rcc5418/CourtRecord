Grr...!

She hasn't tried to channel me since yesterday.

... Well, like I said. For a lawyer, the worst of times are when you have to force your biggest smiles.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
B-But!
</p><p>Mia:<br />
You can't give up! There's still some hope left.

<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">March 23, 10:00 AM<br />District Court<br />Courtroom No. 3</span></center>
<p>Judge:<br />
Court is now in session for the trial of Matt Engarde.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, as I recall, we concluded yesterday's session with a big mystery on our hands. The mystery being what exactly was Ms. Adrian Andrews' role in this murder? That is to say, is she really connected to the crime itself? Mr. Edgeworth, if you would please inform the court of today's proceedings.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Adrian Andrews. She forged evidence that threw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, and then proceeded to escape the crime scene by wearing a Nickel Samurai costume. The guilt of these actions are those from which she cannot escape.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm, then you're saying that she is guilty after all...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm not finished, Your Honor. Ms. Andrews has nothing to do with committing the actual murder.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I would like to direct the court's attention to this card.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What is that...? It looks like a shell...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This is the calling card of a certain assassin.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">A-Assassin</span>, you say!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, Juan Corrida was killed by a professional assassin! And the person who hired the assassin, his client so to speak, is Matt Engarde!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-What a surprising turn of events!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I would think it's become commonplace by now, Your Honor.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I know what's going on this time... So I know that everything Edgeworth has said is true...)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br />
But we still have to hold out as long as we can. At least, until Maya's safe and sound.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I wonder how the trial will turn out today...?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now then, please call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The prosecution calls the defendant's "mentor", Mr. Will Powers to the stand.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Now then, witness. Your name and occupation, please.
</p><p>Powers:<br />
O-OK. I'm... Uh... Will Powers. I'm a poor, underpaid action star...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And what is your relation to the defendant?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Well, that's... I guess I'm sort of a lousy mentor to him in a way. Yeah.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Um, Mr. Powers. Please... You don't need to put yourself down so much.
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Oh, uh, sorry. Well, but I'm just kind of a nothing sort of guy.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
On the night of the murder, you visited the defendant's room. Is this correct?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Y-Yes.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I... I didn't know that...)</span>
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Um, but you know... I didn't actually get to see Matt when I went...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
All you need to do is answer what you're asked. Now then, I would like you to please testify about when you went to Mr. Engarde's room.
</p><p>Powers:<br />
O-OK... Sure...
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Visit to Matt's Room --</span></center>
<p>Powers:<br />
After the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room.<br />
Matt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume.<br />
He was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.<br />
I watched the two of them for a while, but then I gave up and went back.<br />
I had guests with me that night, and I couldn't make them wait for me.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Nothing sounds out of place in Mr. Powers' testimony.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And talking with the bellboy is no big deal...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If one assumes that the person Mr. Engarde was speaking with was an ordinary bellboy...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-What are you implying?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Well, Mr. Wright. Let's have your cross-examination, shall we?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Looks like we're in another sticky situation.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
A trap. Can't you smell it, Phoenix? But for us to find out more, we're just going to have to charge in head first, right?

So he gave the bellboy a tip. What's so strange about that?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Ah, well, you see, Matt's not a poor penny-pincher like me. I was trying to figure out how much it was because the tip really shocked me.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
"How much it was"...?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
But that's when something even more surprising happened! The bellboy was putting the tip he got in his pocket. And that's when I got my first good look at the guy's face... I was really shocked!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... I'm afraid I don't follow at all.

Ahem! I hope you know that discrimination towards old men is a no-no in my court!
</p><p>Powers:<br />
No, no, that's not what I meant at all! In the smack middle of the guy's face, there was a line of <span style="color:#E16935">stitches</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A line of stitches...?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Yeah! And it went straight from the tippy top of his head to the bottom of his chin! Almost like if that thread snapped, all the stuff in his head would come spilling out.

So you're saying that it's suspicious for him to be empty-handed?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Yeah, really suspicious. I mean, when I first saw that bellboy, he was holding a tray in his hand! And there was a <span style="color:#E16935">bottle of juice</span> and a <span style="color:#E16935">wine glass</span> on it!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Juice...? What kind of juice was it?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Um, I'm pretty sure it was tomato juice...

If we could come up with some sort of reason as to why he would come out empty-handed, some sort of proof, then I think we can dodge the bullet on this one for now.

In any case, if that bellboy was the assassin, it would be very bad for us.

But... he really is the assassin, you know?

Yes... But. You can't give in yet. If you want to prolong this trial for as long as possible, you're going to have to pull some cheap tricks on this one.

Mr. Powers.
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Y-Y-Yes?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You're easily influenced by other people's words, aren't you? As soon as you heard that the bellboy might have been the killer, you got caught up in believing it must be true.
</p><p>Powers:<br />
But... But... Isn't he really suspicious!?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
He's got all those stitches, and... and...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So? A baseball has stitches! Are you saying all baseballs are suspicious because they have stitches!?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
*gulp!* Well, there's also... I mean, what about him being empty-handed!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I would like to ask the court to please take a look here.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
This is... the crime scene...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
There is a wine glass sitting next to Mr. Corrida's body. The liquid inside this glass is tomato juice. And now, if you would look at what is on top of the table in the lower right corner here... Anyone can clearly see that it is a <span style="color:#E16935">tray</span> with a <span style="color:#E16935">bottle of tomato juice</span> on it! The bellboy had just brought this to Mr. Corrida's room. He left the tray in the room, which is why he was empty-handed when he left!
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Aah!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
B-But! That would mean that the bellboy had seen and left a dead body in the room!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ah, but can you prove that Mr. Corrida was already dead at that time?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Uh... M-Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Yes?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I-I blame you for leading me down this route!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh heh heh. I'm terribly sorry...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What is with him? Why is he laughing??)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Witness. Isn't there one more thing you would like to share with us?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
I-Is there?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The bellboy was empty-handed... Or should I say empty-"<span style="color:#E16935">hand</span>"ed? I recall you had something interesting to say about his hands...
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Oh yeah! I almost forgot!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh? Wh-What...?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
That bellboy -- he was wearing <span style="color:#E16935">gloves</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Gloves?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Yeah, pitch black, leather ones. All the other bellboys don't wear gloves like that, right?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Black leather gloves... Why didn't you mention them earlier!?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
S-Sorry... It slipped my mind.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Argh! Boy does this make the bellboy look really suspicious... Alright, got to focus. I can't get lax here!)</span> So what if he had gloves? A lot of bellboys wear gloves!
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Come on, Mr. Wright! That bellboy was wearing black leather ones!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So? A football is made of leather! Are you saying all footballs are suspicious because they are made of leather!?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
*gulp!*
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But that man... He received a large <span style="color:#E16935">roll of cash</span> from the defendant. And then he was seen leaving the crime scene wearing <span style="color:#E16935">black leather gloves</span>. I don't think that even someone like myself can believe he was just another bellboy...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Urgh...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It seems that we have finally come to an understanding... Now then, witness. Please continue with the rest of your testimony.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

Oh yes, please tell us more.

He gave something to the person inside the room.<br />
Then the old guy just left, without even going into the room.<br />
After that, I went to the bathroom and then back to my seat.

Well, Mr. Powers' testimony just now was just as vague as his first.
</p><p>Mia:<br />
It's a little troublesome, isn't it? But I'm sure if you press him enough, everything will become clearer. Although, that just makes it harder on us, doesn't it?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Uh, it was me, Your Honor...
</p><p>Mia:<br />
What is it, Phoenix?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I have a feeling that something bad is going to happen once I show this...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mr. Wright! If you have something to say, please spit it out!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-Yes, Your Honor. <span style="color:#0070C0">(OK Phoenix, deep breath...)</span> Mr. Powers. The "something" you saw... Was it this item?
</p><p>Powers:<br />
Oh, hey! That's it! That's the something! Wow, Mr. Wright. You really figured it out.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm, I recall we found this at Matt Engarde's mansion...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
At the d-defendant's house!? What does this mean!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It's simple, Your Honor. Shelly de Killer assassinated Juan Corrida in his room. And then he stole this wooden bear from the scene of the crime.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Then, the bear being found at Mr. Engarde's mansion would mean...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It goes without saying, Your Honor. Mr. Matt Engarde is De Killer's client!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! Order! ...I said ORDER!!! Mr. Wright. This is a most unfortunate turn of events for you.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yeah... Sorry, Mia.
</p><p>Mia:<br />
No, it's alright. Your judgment was sound. Actually, I figured the bear would come up. If not now, then it would have later on. Even if you hadn't shown it to the court, I'm sure your friend Edgeworth would've.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ah, I almost forgot that he knew about it too...)</span>

Hmm... I think it is clear that there is no need for us to continue this trial.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
There are still a few points left that we have not fully explored!

Oh... Well, we can't have that. Alright, Mr. Wright. What questionable point would you like to explore further?

We have this area completely surrounded. There is no way for him to escape.

I can't believe it... That <span style="color:#E16935">butler</span>... All this time, he was <span style="color:#E16935">De Killer</span>...

<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
De Killer and Engarde were <span style="color:#E16935">working together</span>, so to speak.
</p><p>Engarde:<br />
And De Killer was hiding at Engarde Mansion... as its <span style="color:#E16935">butler</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-What a... bold move...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The bear figurine was brought back to Engarde Mansion by De Killer himself. When it looked like he was about to be arrested, Engarde had him do so. I assume because it would've been bad had the police found it during their investigation.

Y-Yeah, sort of... We just barely found something to latch onto.

M-Mia!

It looks like Maya was unconscious until just a few minutes ago. As soon as she woke up, she called for me.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So it was Maya that called you away!
</p><p>Mia:<br />
She's locked in a dusty little room right now. But I could see a circus tent outside the window about 300 feet away!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Gumshoe! Is there a circus in town right now!?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
<span style="color:green">There's only one, pal! The Berry Big Circus!</span>

Maya is somewhere within a 300 feet radius of the main tent!

<span style="color:green">Wh-What!? ... OK, hold on a sec, pal! Hey! Draw a circle on that map! About a 300 feet radius from the main tent! Hurry!</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br />
And...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
I could see a mailbox under the window.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Gumshoe! There's also a mailbox!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
<span style="color:green">Hmm... OK! What else?</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What else, Mia!?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
I'm sorry, but it was a very small window. I couldn't see anything else... It felt like I was in an old office building... Maybe the third floor or so...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
<span style="color:green">I heard her! An old office building. Good stuff, pal! OK, just hang in there! Just a little longer, pal! Wish us luck!</span>

Court will now reconvene.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
De Killer, the man who murdered the victim, handed this to his client. From this, one obvious question arises. "Why this particular item?" I believe the answer to that question will provide us with the name of the real criminal. Now then, the prosecution calls the defendant's manager, Adrian Andrews, to the stand!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Currently, the witness is accused of tampering and obstruction of justice.
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However, you have been called to the witness stand today to ascertain... who exactly is guilty of murder.
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
I understand.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Very good. Now, have you ever seen this bear before, Ms. Andrews?
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
Of course I have.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You have seen it before?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's right. It's only natural that the witness has. Ms. Andrews. Could you please enlighten the court to this bear's secrets?

Alright.

Actually, this is an elaborate puzzle.<br />
If you know the correct order, it can be taken apart one piece at a time.<br />
At its center is a small cavity, with just enough room to store a small item.<br />
Because of its complexity, if you don't know the order, you can't open the bear.<br />
You really can't tell that it's a small "jewelry box" just by looking at it.
</p>

<p>Judge:<br />
So this figurine... it's a container of sorts, is it...?
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
Yes. Looks can be deceiving, wouldn't you agree?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes. This is superb craftmanship. ...Oh, yes, I nearly forgot. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.

<p>Andrews:<br />
I've opened it. Is this what you wanted?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-What is that? It looks like a... note...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I don't think we need to guess at what that is... Do we, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It's the suicide note.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The suicide note?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The suicide note left by Juan Corrida's former manager, Celeste Inpax. Until now, no one knew of its whereabouts... But just as we suspected, it was hidden. Hidden by the victim, Juan Corrida himself. It seems Celeste Inpax had very beautiful handwriting. And she just as beautifully signed her own name on this document. This is most definitely the note she left right before she committed suicide!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
O-ORDER! Witness! Did you know about this...?
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
...Yes, I did. I heard all about it from Juan. When I discovered his body... I looked for the bear. I wanted to destroy the note before it became public. But... I couldn't find it anywhere.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Because it had already been taken by De Killer.
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Everything is going at Mr. Edgeworth's pace... So now that the suicide note has been found, what's the next logical question?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
"What is written on the note...?"
</p><p>Mia:<br />
That's right... At least, that's what I would think...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Now then, I believe it is only appropriate the contents of this note be made known.
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
I can't stop you, can I...? I went through so much... just to get my hands on it. And I was going to burn it... for her sake.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm deeply sorry, but I can't allow you to persuade me to stop. Your Honor. If you could please read the contents of this note aloud.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
The judge's voice rang loud and clear though the dead silent courtroom... In her note, Celeste Inpax left to us a record of all that had happened to her... About being used and then thrown away by Engarde... About being engaged to Corrida, and Engarde's role in destroying that... And about how she decided, in her despair, to end it all.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
... And that's all Ms. Inpax had to say.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
There is one thing I would like to say here. The prosecution has no interest in slandering Mr. Engarde.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Then... What...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Our intention, Your Honor, is to establish a <span style="color:#E16935">motive for murder</span>. Isn't that correct, witness?
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
Yes... On the night of the murder, Juan was going to make the contents of the note public. After the post-ceremony show... he was going to hold a press conference.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
My word...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Matt Engarde values above all else, his "refreshing like a spring breeze" image. Which is why he had to stop this note from being made public... At any cost!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Celeste's Suicide Note added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>...It's Engarde's fault that woman killed herself...
</p><p>...And this time, he even went so far as to kill someone to stop him from revealing that!
</p><p>...How terrible...! What a selfish person...!
</p><p>I guess there are slimeball lawyers out there who will defend these creeps too!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
There is no margin for doubt here. Mr. de Killer's client's goal was to obtain this <span style="color:#E16935">suicide note</span>. And the only person who needed this note that badly is the <span style="color:#E16935">defendant</span>. Let's not forget that the bear with the note inside was found at the defendant's house!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It seems that we have come to the truth at last. The defendant's motives were entirely selfish. He deserves no sympathy from anyone!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Urk... <span style="color:#0070C0">(How am I supposed to escape from this one!?)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Why the hesitation, Phoenix? Gumshoe hasn't called yet, so you know what you must do.

I think Your Honor believes that Matt Engarde killed in order to obtain this note.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, that is correct.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But that seems a little strange. In fact, I think there is a contradiction here!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
This note was hidden by Mr. Corrida until the night of the murder. If that is the case... I say that Matt Engarde could not have known what was written on this note!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh! I didn't think of it that way...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Exactly. But I did think of it that way, and I thought it was rather strange. No one in their right mind would kill for a note without first knowing what it said!

</p><p>...He's still going at it...?
</p><p>...It's like he doesn't care that he's trying to get a killer off the hook!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The assassin took this with him from the crime scene after murdering Mr. Corrida. At the request of his client, of course.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, what's your point, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I don't think it's possible that Mr. de Killer's client was Matt Engarde. In fact, I think there is a contradiction here!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You can't tell by just looking at it that this bear is really a jewelry box. The chances that Matt Engarde thought the note was inside this bear... Are zero to none!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh! I didn't think of it that way...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Exactly. But I did think of it that way, and I thought it was rather strange. After all, there is no reason why Mr. Engarde would ever want a jewelry box like this!

<p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! Order! Y-You make a valid point, Mr. Wright! Mr. Edgeworth! What is your opinion!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It was just a flash, but I think I did rather well on this one...)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Unfortunately... I think he believes differently.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I believe a show of appreciation is in order.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
H-Huh?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The defense seems to be in love with wishing more despair upon itself.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I would like to direct the court's attention to this.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What is that...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It is a very small video camera, Your Honor. This type of camera is commonly used as a means of <span style="color:#E16935">spying</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
S-Spying...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What the...!? I thought that spy camera was in <span style="color:#E16935">my possession</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Matt Engarde and the victim both thought of the other as their biggest rival. They even went so far as to use this type of item to find each other's weaknesses!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The victim, Juan Corrida, was being spied on! His personal life was being watched by none other than Matt Engarde!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Oooooorder!! Ahem! Mr. Wright!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You... Don't tell me you knew about your client's spying activities!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well... sort of...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
"Sort of" is not an acceptable answer, Mr. Wright!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I see you are confused, Mr. Wright. You're probably thinking, "But I have the camera that was in the stuffed bear's eye..."
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
But this camera that I have is not that same one. Last night, I searched the <span style="color:#E16935">victim's house</span> on a hunch... Using this...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Gumshoe's bug sweeper...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
By the way, Mr. Wright. The defendant's <span style="color:#E16935">fingerprints</span> were found on this camera.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Matt Engarde's fingerprints were on there!?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Well, Phoenix... It looks like those cameras were hidden all over the place, huh?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What am I supposed to say to that evidence...?)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I think this is the end. It's fairly obvious that Mr. Engarde learned of the suicide note through this. He was watching the victim all along.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He got me good this time! I don't have anything to counter that!)</span>
</p><p>...Hey, hey... Now what's that lawyer thinking...?
</p><p>...Mommy? Is that man the bad killer guy?
</p><p>...Shush! Stop! Don't look at him!
</p><p>...The way he's sweating is just so... Eww... Nasty...
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Phoenix...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes, Chief!?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Have you figured out what you're going to do next yet?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What I'm going to do next!? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Does running away like a frightened child work?)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br />
I know it seems like Mr. Edgeworth is very close to putting the lid on this case. But... In his eagerness to prove his point, he forgot one very <span style="color:#E16935">important thing</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well, what is it, Mia!?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
There is a piece of evidence that he really should <span style="color:#E16935">investigate</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Something he should <span style="color:#E16935">investigate</span>?)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br />
I would really hate to see the good prosecutor get scolded... For not remembering to look into the item when he had the chance.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why are you speaking in riddles all of a sudden...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Alright, I think this time we finally understand everything. Well, Mr. Wright? You don't have any further objections, do you?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What is this <span style="color:#E16935">piece of evidence</span> that Mia is talking about...? Can I figure out what it is that still needs to be looked at, or should I let it go...?)</span>

Hmm... Who knows?

I mean, sure, this "suicide note" was found inside this bear. But this bear was in my possession until a few moments ago. Which means... The <span style="color:#E16935">handwriting</span> on this "suicide note" has <span style="color:#E16935">yet to be analyzed</span>!

Mr. Wright! You... Are you saying this suicide note is a <span style="color:#E16935">fake</span>!?

Ms. Andrews... You were the one who tried to pin this murder on Mr. Engarde. Who's to say you didn't create a <span style="color:#E16935">fake "suicide note"</span> and put it into this bear!?

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's odd. Any items like that are usually sent to the crime lab first...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
<span style="color:green">We don't have time to wait for those guys, sir! When those guys weren't looking, I swiped the stuff and ran!</span>

</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
<span style="color:green">Well... I'm not a detective anymore, so I had to... I'm really sorry, sir, but I've got to put the law on hold for now!</span>

A-Alright... Just get here in one piece.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
<span style="color:green">I'm on a mission and no one can stop me now, sir! No one! I'm pulling out all the stops and <span style="color:#E16935">running every red light</span>!</span>

<p>Phoenix:<br />
Wh-What happened?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It sounded like he had an accident. I'm guessing his cell phone broke as well.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Wh-What was he thinking?? We've got to hurry and call for help!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
But we have no idea where he is. His cell phone is broken, and he wasn't driving a patrol car, so no radio either. Also... If we don't get to those items before they do, the police will take possessions of them.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
No! We can't let that happen!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Well, if there is a way we can find out where he is, then we stand a chance...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

Wright. It doesn't suit someone like you to cry useless tears. Whether you did your job well or not... That can only be seen after the verdict has been decided.

Yes, bailiff?

There's a phone call for you, sir. They said it was extremely urgent.

</p><p>Mia:<br />
It looks like something unexpected just happened to him.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now then, Mr. Edgeworth. If you could please tell the court the results of the handwriting analysis on Ms. Inpax's suicide note...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Y...Yes, Your Honor. Unfortunately... We have discovered that this suicide note is a forgery.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What!?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This... This note was not written by Ms. Inpax herself! It is a <span style="color:#E16935">fake</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! Would you care to explain what is going on!? If this was not written by Ms. Inpax, then who wrote it!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
We would need more time to do a more detailed analysis, however... It appears that the handwriting matches that of the victim, <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Juan Corrida</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Mr. C-Corrida...?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Well, well... It looks like Ms. Inpax never left a suicide note after all. She never wrote anything about Engarde...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However! Your Honor. Even though this suicide note is indeed a fake, Mr. Engarde could not have known that, and so that facts remain unchanged! Acting under the assumption that it was real, he had plotted to possess it!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... That does sound very plausible.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This theory that Engarde had no idea that the suicide note was fake... Something seems a little wrong with it...)</span>

<p>Judge:<br />
So then, the defendant knew this suicide note was a fake. And if that's true, then the situation has suddenly changed in a very dramatic way.

Exactly, Your Honor! The prosecution's theory as to what Mr. Engarde's <span style="color:#E16935">motive for murder</span> was... It has suddenly disappeared into thin air!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
But Your Honor! It's not as if Mr. Engarde monitored Mr. Corrida 24 hours a day! Perhaps the victim wrote the note in a place Mr. Engarde didn't know of!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well, right back at you, Mr. Edgeworth! Why don't you show us some proof that the victim made the forgery at an unknown place!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Gnnngh!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! Order! ...Mr. Edgeworth. It looks like this time, it is you who has dug his own grave.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Unnnngh... As I figured...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Huh? ...As you figured...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
As I figured... It came down to this after all...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth, you are not making any sense...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
When I heard the results of the handwriting analysis, I thought this might happen. The question is... "What next?"
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What next...??
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If the prosecution can't prove Mr. Engarde's motive through the evidence, then we must prove it from another angle.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, I agree with you there...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Your Honor. The prosecution... would like to call a witness to the stand at this time...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh. Well, that's fine.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However... this witness... This witness is a little... unusual...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Edgeworth stuttering...? This is not like him at all.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Unusual? Well, what sort of witness is this person, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This witness is one who is <span style="color:#E16935">perfectly fit</span> to answer once and for all the question of, "Who was it that hired Shelly de Killer to commit murder?"
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's impossible!! Who in the...!? No such person exists who can answer that question with such certainty!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Y-Yes! Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this witness!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It is... It's... um...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes!? Go on! Who is it!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The man himself... Mr. Shelly de Killer.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, Mr. de Killer. ... W-W-Waaaaait!! Shelly de Killer!? Um, you mean... The killer? Err... I mean the assassin?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes... Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
He's coming here? To the witness stand...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Well, yes, in a manner of speaking... I recognize that this is a very unusual circumstance, so I ask for your permission.

It looks like we have run into yet another unexpected turn of events... Well, it doesn't seem like we have too many choices under these circumstances, so...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Now then, witness. There is one thing I would like to confirm before we speak of anything else.
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
<span style="color:green">And what would that be?</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
At the request of a client, you killed Mr. Juan Corrida. Is this correct?
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
<span style="color:green">... It is as you say. I did indeed kill Mr. Corrida.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
*gulp*

Now that we have answered that, let's move on to the name of your client!

<p>Judge:<br />
The prosecution has failed to provide a motive and has instead, provided this suicide note, which is a forgery created by the victim. Furthermore, there is a possibility the defendant himself knew it was a fake. But most definitive of all, we have heard from the assassin himself; the name of his client. Mr. de Killer's client who requested the murder was not the defendant at all!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...No...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
With all this evidence, it is obvious to me that this means that Mr. Matt Engarde... Is <span style="color:#E16935">innocent</span>!

<span style="color:green">I seem to have caused you all a bit of confusion. Please, continue your discussion, and call me when you have reached a verdict.</span>

Bailiff! Please bring Ms. Adrian Andrews in immediately!

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Who would've believed that the prosecution's own witness would absolve the defendant!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Your Honor! The prosecution requests permission to further question the witness! Shelly de Killer is certainly lying under oath!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm...
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
It wasn't me! Listen! Everyone! Please! That testimony just now... It was all one big lie!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ms. Andrews...
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
The suicide note may have been a fake. But! That man... Matt... He's the reason Celeste died! And Juan's death... It was all because he got pulled into Matt's twisted world! That testimony just now... You have to believe me... It was a horrible, horrible lie...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But... Mr. de Killer himself has testified... He has named <span style="color:#E16935">you</span> as his client.
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
No! That's not true!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Also, there is quite a bit of evidence that points to you. The knife and button, donning the Nickel Samurai's costume...
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
But that's... That's...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You even have a motive. We know that Ms. Celeste Inpax was a large part of your life. You wanted to follow her... And you wanted revenge against the two who hurt her. I would say you have plenty of reasons to want them both dead.
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
I... No... Mr. Wright!

Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
We still have the cross-examination to do...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But you don't need to question testimony like this... Do you, Mr. Wright?

... Your Honor, the defense will question the witness. <span style="color:#0070C0">(As if I have a choice here!)</span>

Thank you so much for taking the time to testify, Mr. de Killer.
</p><p>de Killer:<br />

When Adrian Andrews entered the victim's room, your "client" had no idea that Juan Corrida had been murdered!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But how... How do you know that!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
From this wine glass, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The glass...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Mr. de Killer's supposed client thought Mr. Corrida had only fainted. Which is why this glass of tomato juice was poured for the victim!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... But isn't that just a part of Adrian Andrews' calculated plan?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That is not possible, Your Honor. This glass bears the fingerprints of that person. Had this been planned, they would never have left their fingerprints behind!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I see your point... Mr. Edgeworth!? What is your opinion?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Strangely enough... I had the same exact thought just now. Witness! How do you explain this strange phenomenon!?
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
<span style="color:green">I-Isn't it a waste of time to ask about such a minor detail? It's not a very important point anyway, correct...?</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'm afraid you are mistaken. If Adrian Andrews really is your client, as you claim... Then your client should have had knowledge of Mr. Corrida's death. If not... Then that can only mean that Adrian Andrews was never your client at all!

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth... I understand your logic on this one... However... Why would the assassin make such a basic mistake?

I believe it has to do with her <span style="color:#E16935">name</span>, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Her name?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. Adrian Andrews is, without a doubt, a very androgynous name.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Yes, I see...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Unluckily for Mr. de Killer, the entire time he was on the stand, no one had stated Adrian Andrews' gender. And so, he simply picked the wrong gender to go with.

Oh, no, it's not like that at all. I just think lies aren't a good thing, you know...?
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
<span style="color:green">Oh, I know and agree. Lies are not a good thing at all...</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Urk.

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... If only you were this apologetic all the time... Anyway, I do not see a huge contradiction here. Therefore, you may continue witness.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If that is the case, then even though I am reluctant, I must believe that Mr. de Killer's testimony is <span style="color:#E16935">accurate</span>. That would mean that Shelly de Killer's client is... <span style="color:#E16935">Adrian Andrews</span>!

If I end the trial here, right now, then your client, Matt Engarde, would be declared <span style="color:#E16935">innocent</span>. And in his place, Adrian Andrews would be charged with murder.

To be honest, I can't think of you as a truly innocent and good person. You have done enough evil to drive a woman to suicide.
</p><p>Engarde:<br />
...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But... At least on the charge of murder, it would appear you are innocent.
</p><p>Engarde:<br />
... Hah...! So, I guess even the old fuddy-duddy figured me out!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
M-Mr. Engarde...?
</p><p>Engarde:<br />
You were atrocious as a lawyer, weren't you? Giving your client away like this! And that "refreshing like a spring breeze" crap; it's just as atrocious, don't you agree? ... Anyway, get on with it and pronounce me innocent already. Right, Mister Lawyer!?

Now, Ms. von Karma. If you please.

These pieces of evidence are items left by De Killer during his escape from the police.

Huh?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
De Killer will always place his client's wishes first. If Engarde himself wished to be convicted, then he will let his hostage go.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Th-That may be true, but... That's asking me to do the impossible!
</p><p>Mia:<br />
The second way... Force De Killer to end his contract with Engarde. If De Killer were to no longer think of Engarde as his "client"... Then he would let Maya go.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Mia! That's even more impossible! He is a man who values his duty towards his clients above all else!
</p><p>Mia:<br />
... I know both of these seem like impossible feats at first. But if you could make either one happen, it would truly be a "miracle".
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The bigger problem is, the judge has already said he doesn't need any more evidence! The pieces he was just shown; he's not accepting them!
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Phoenix. Think things through from the <span style="color:#E16935">other side</span>. Isn't that what has always worked for us?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(The "other side"...? Wait, does she mean...)</span> You mean... to <span style="color:#E16935">turn things around</span>?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Phoenix. The judge says he doesn't need the evidence. If that's the case, then who does need it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">("The person who needs the evidence"...)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br />
The defense, prosecution, and the judge... We have seen all the pieces of evidence. And that is how we have come to know the "<span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>". But there are people who have not seen them all. And those people do not know the "truth". That truth... It may be what will bring about the miracle in the end.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
There are no objections this time, correct? Now then, I will pronounce my verdict!
</p><p>Engarde:<br />
Why don't we all respectfully sit back and listen, kids.

Yes... I plan to pay my debt to society for my own crime, Your Honor. ... This trial was the first time I had stood on the witness stand, and when I did... I really felt hopeless.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She must be talking about the time Edgeworth really went after her... I guess she's trying to forgive him for what he did...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
This witness... How should I put this... She has an illness.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
If you're going to say you would "choose death", that is of no concern to me.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Andrews:<br />
But... after that, when I was alone at the detention center... That's the first time I really saw myself and who I am.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
And today... When the two of you used your combined strength to convict Matt... I... I felt like I had finally been saved.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Wow, this is the first time I've ever seen her smile.)</span>
</p><p>Andrews:<br />
I am really happy that you two were in charge of this case. I really don't know how to express how I feel at this moment... This is... This is the first time I've felt comfortable with myself; with who I am. Thank you so much, everyone!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
It looks like we have resolved everything at last. As for myself, there are still a few things I'm confused about... But everyone seems to be in good spirits, and that is good enough for me. That is all. This court is adjourned!

<p>Mia:<br />
You were great out there, Phoenix!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What I did out there was right... wasn't it?
</p><p>Mia:<br />
... This is the first time you've not gotten your client off. You got them a "guilty" verdict this time. But... You have to look past all of that, to what's really important. You now realize that there is something more than just getting a "not guilty", right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes, I understand now.
</p><p>Mia:<br />
Phoenix, think back for a second. Think to the moments before Ms. von Karma arrived with the final pieces of evidence. Think about the incredible decision you had to make...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Now then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear the defense's final statements on this matter.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I can't count on the evidence to help me anymore. I have to listen to my heart! Should I side with justice? Or should I save Maya's life?)</span> My client... Matt Engarde is...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Mia:<br />
Is he "guilty"... or is he "not guilty"...? Those were your choices then. And your answer... Your answer spoke to what being a "<span style="color:#E16935">lawyer</span>" means to you...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wright!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
E-Edgeworth...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I have good news. Maya is now safe in police custody!
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Really!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
P-Pearls--
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
You're telling us the truth, right Mr. Edgeworth!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Y-Yes... She's quite safe. She is on her way here as we speak in a patrol car.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Aaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Maya's safe!! You did it! You really did it, Mr. Nick!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oww... She punches deceptively hard for a kid...)</span>
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
I... I believed in you. I kept saying to myself: Mr. Nick will save her... Mr. Nick will save her... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ah, um... Thanks.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What's wrong?
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Ms. von Karma...
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Um... About earlier... Uh... Thanks... OWW!!
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Why are you still smiling... Mr. Phoenix Wright!? You... You lost!! Your perfect win record has now been crushed! And yet... You are still happy!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
... I don't think you'll ever understand... Ms. von Karma.
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
How dare you!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Don't worry. She may in time. After all, I was like that myself, until a year ago...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
E-Edgeworth...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
For my own personal victories... and for guilty verdicts... I used every dirty trick in the book. And so my win record remained spotless. But... A man appeared and stood fast against that selfish me. I fought him in my usual manner, and tasted my first defeat. I felt like I had lost everything because of that. And then... It was my turn to sit in the defendant's chair. And I was saved... by that person I called my "enemy"... I couldn't forgive myself for all that had happened. So I left the Prosecutor's Office. And I left that note... "Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth chooses death"...
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Hmph, as well you should have. A prosecutor who has shamed himself with defeat should crawl into a hole and die!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...But that was not what happened. After I left the Prosecutor's Office, I finally came to realize something. And it was in that moment of clarity that everything began to change.
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Wh-What foolish nonsense...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
We prosecutors use anything we can to attack the defendant. But every time we did so...

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
No matter how desperate the situation... instead of giving up like most people, that man would hold strong with his undying faith. And then, before I knew it... I began to <span style="color:#E16935">trust</span> in that man as well.
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Wh-What!? You trusted your enemy!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It doesn't matter how many underhanded tricks a person uses... The truth will always find a way to make itself known. The only thing we can do is to fight with the knowledge we hold and everything we have. Erasing the paradoxes one by one... It's never easy... We claw and scratch for every inch. But we will always eventually reach that one single <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>. This I promise you.
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
The "truth"...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. That's the reason why prosecutors and defense lawyers exist. But I'm sure you knew that already, didn't you Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's why you couldn't forgive me; this man who went into hiding. Isn't that right? This man who only had his sights set on "victory", who ran away into the night...
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Ah! Is... Is Mr. Edgeworth right, Mr. Nick...!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You really let me down...)</span> When you disappeared, I felt... betrayed. The reason I decided to become a lawyer to begin with... Was because I believed in the things you said to me, all those years ago... And you... You betrayed your own words. That's why... one year ago, I made up my mind. I decided that the Miles Edgeworth I knew had died... ...At least, that's what I told myself.
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
You pathetic fool!
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
M-Ms. von Karma...
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
I don't want to hear the wretched whimpering of a disgraced loser! A Von Karma is someone who is destined to be perfect! Miles Edgeworth... You are no longer worthy! You are no longer worthy of being a Von Karma! And neither am I! It's over... It's all over!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Franziska threw something on the ground just now...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This is... an <span style="color:#E16935">electromagnetic receiver</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Isn't that the thing she used to track Detective Gumshoe...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I'll return this to the precinct later. There's something else...
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Ah! Isn't that Ms. von Karma's whip!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
"I'll never set foot in another courtroom again"... I'm sure that's what she's saying by this action...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You should keep this, Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
... Umm... OK.
</p><p>???:<br />
Nick!!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
......! M-M-M... MAYA!
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaa!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Oh, Nick! I knew you would come through! You got Engarde convicted, like I knew you would... And on top of that, you even rescued me!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well, of course I did! You know I would never desert you! But we sure pressed our luck this trial... You're really lucky to be standing here!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Whatever, whatever. Look, it's over, OK? Besides, if I did croak, I would just come back and haunt you like a bad ghost through Pearly!

Oh, Mr. Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Um... I'm relieved you're alright.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Hey... It looks like you've made some real progress, Mr. Edgeworth!

Umm... Well, I suppose I'm a little different from who I was a year ago.

Heh...

Alright! I think it's time we got out of this depressing place!

Food, Nick! FOOD! Grub! Chow! I'm starved! I'm so hungry even you look like a nice, juicy burger on a bun to me, Nick!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-You think I look like a burger...? I'm a Prime Rib at least!
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Come with us, Mr. Edgeworth! Please!!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Uh, um... If you insist...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Alright... So how about we hit up our usual burger joint...?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Don't be silly, Nick.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
This case messed up that awesome evening, and got in the way of my gourmet food. So I've decided that we have to make it up by having another feast!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
A-Another feast...?

You know, when you think about it, you were the one who saved the day, Detective!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Huh? Me? ...You really think so?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
He's right. If it wasn't for the three items you took... I think this trial would have had a very different ending.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Ah, well, you know... It's... Ho ho. Ho ho ho ho. Ho ho ho ho ho. ...Huh? Wait. That's odd... When I ran off with the things from De Killer's hideout... I was sure I took <span style="color:#E16935">4 things</span> total, sir.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
What?
</p><p>Pearl:<br />
Four?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yeah, I'm sure I put one of the items in my coat pocket...

Aw, come on y'all. It's over! But whoo boy, I tell ya! You really are somethin' else! Between getting' accused of murder and getting' kidnapped... Never a dull moment with you, huh?

Hahaha, you think?

Sounds like ya had it rough, gal! So where's this picture of yers?

This thing is picking something up.

Ah! That's! That's Ms. von Karma's receiver! Ugh. Thanks to her, I had the most awful experience of my life, sir! I can't believe she stuck a tracking device on me...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's odd. Even though you're standing right here... The tracking device seems to be in a different location.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Oh... It's probably busted or something, sir.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
... ...Well, it doesn't matter. I'm afraid it's about time for me to excuse myself. I still have some work to do.
</p><p>Maya:<br />

They used to call me Queen Wendy, and treat me like royalty, and any man who hasn't heard about this is going to feel the pain of my heel, yes they're going to feel the burn, and speaking of burn, playing with fire is very dangerous and because of that, three of the warehouses where they stored the scenery were burned right down and that caused a huge stink that

I appreciate everything you and Mr. Edgeworth did for me from the bottom of my heart. Oh, that's right. I received a letter from Ms. von Karma. She said that after I get out, I should feel free to consult her about anything at all. I'm really thankful to have met everyone!

<p>Where are you going... Franziska?
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
...! How did you know I was here...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
With this.
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
That's...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I heard you were planting things on a certain person. Things like tracking devices in his <span style="color:#E16935">coat</span>, for example.
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Hmph. That's just like you. I only planted it there because he was always wearing it. This... filthy, drab coat of his... I don't know how it ended up in my luggage. But it's going in the trash, I promise you that.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Oh, that's right... Speaking of that man... He told me something very interesting.

<p>Gumshoe:<br />
When I ran off with the things from De Killer's hideout... I was sure I took <span style="color:#E16935">4 things</span> total, sir.

<p>von Karma:<br />
Four items...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It seems he put the last one in his coat pocket.
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
He put it in here...? ... It doesn't matter anymore. The case is already over.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
... What are you going to do now?
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
... That's none of your business.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Are you running away?
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Shut up! You don't understand a thing! You can't possibly understand what it means to be "Manfred von Karma's daughter"!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Franziska...
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
So many expectations from everyone around me... Expectations I must fulfill! I'm expected to win no matter what. And failure? Such a thing is not an option for me! My father was a genius. There's no doubt about that! But... But me... I'm no genius. I've always known that.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
But I... I had to be one. I had to.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
... You may not be a genius like your father... But... You are a prosecutor. You have been and always will be.
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
...! No, I'm not... Not anymore. I've even thrown my whip away.

I believe you can. Just like how Adrian Andrews did.

Adrian Andrews...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You were going to use her during the trial, right? But you... You were "dependant" on your father by using his tactics. Isn't that right?
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Hmph!

Today, you chased after me, after I had left you behind all these years. And that's why we're standing here now, side by side.

But I have no intention of stopping. If you say you are going to quit your walk down the prosecutor's path... ... Then, this is where we part ways, Franziska von Karma.
