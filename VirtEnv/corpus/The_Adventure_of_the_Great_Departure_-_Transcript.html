<p><i>Anime cutscene</i><br />
The Empire of Japan - after opening its doors a push for cultural transformation brought great waves of Western influence to this Far Eastern island nation. The revolution washed over the land, making life in the capital exciting and unsettling. It was a period of great change, and some were swept away by the tide. But for one man the turbulence of that era was just the beginning of an extraordinary story.

The Adventure of the Great Departure</div>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">22nd November, 8:43 a.m.<br />
Supreme Court of Judicature, Defendants' Antechamber 5</span></center>
<p><br />
???:
</p>
<center><span style="color:#0070C0">(I still can't believe it. I still can't believe this is happening. How can it be that just beyond the doors to this quiet little chamber... ...is the highest court in Japan, waiting to decide my <span style="color:#E16935">fate</span>?)</span></center>
<p><br />
Bailiff:<br />
What?
</p><p>???:<br />
Oh! No, nothing...
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Save your glares... <span style="color:#E16935">murderer</span>!
</p><p>???:<br />
......... Sorry...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(My name is <span style="color:#E16935">Ryunosuke Naruhodo</span>. I'm a second-year student at the Imperial Yumei University. Three days ago, I somehow found myself in the middle of a horrifying incident. And now here I am, awaiting my <span style="color:#E16935">trial</span>.)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
That's enough! He's not obliged to listen to such abuse, Officer.
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
And who are YOU?!
</p><p>???:<br />
I'm this man's <span style="color:#E16935">lawyer</span>. I'll be defending him today.
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Lawyer?
</p><p>???:<br />
Yes. And until the judge has given his verdict on the case... ...no one has the right to treat him as a criminal. So you will hold your tongue!
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Tsk! Technicalities! Look at you, you haven't even graduated yet!
</p><p>???:<br />
And yet, I still seem to know better than you how a court officer should behave. Right, Ryunosuke?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Y-Yes, of course! Sorry!
</p><p>???:<br />
......... What are you apologising to me for?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, I... No, I suppose that wasn't my fault. ......... But really, <span style="color:#E16935">Kazuma</span>, I never meant to drag you into this. I'm sorry...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ha ha ha hah! There you go again, apologising! Just like always.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Though I must say, you've been all over the newspapers these past few days. 'Yumei University Professor Murdered in Cold Blood by Student!' But obviously...you didn't actually do it, did you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Of course not! You have to believe me! I didn't do it! I... I could never <span style="color:#E16935">murder</span> someone...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Then there's nothing to worry about. Straighten yourself up. Hold your head high.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You mean...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I believe you. I know you're innocent, Ryunosuke.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Kazuma Asogi</span>, my best friend. Also in his second year at Yumei University. But he's far more clever than I. A star student, in fact. He's even a qualified <span style="color:#E16935">lawyer</span>. Impressive, considering he's still an undergraduate.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It's not that impressive. The very concept of lawyers is only a few years old. Here in Japan, anyway. My qualifications don't mean much. Yet.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You said exactly the same thing three days ago. But I'm proud to have a friend like you, Kazuma. Truly. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Three days ago... Yes, that's when <span style="color:#E16935">all this</span> started...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Congratulations, Kazuma! It looks like you're going to get to study abroad at last!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I know! I've been forever dreaming of this day. Finally, those government elites have acknowledged my academic achievements and successes in court.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you'll be representing Japan as you immerse yourself in the most sophisticated legal system in the world! I'm really happy for you. And proud, as your friend. <span style="color:#0070C0">(There's not a soul in the university who doesn't know Kazuma's name. He's a living legend! It's like there's some mysterious aura billowing around his temple.)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I want to bring about change in our own legal system. That's why I have to cross the ocean to see the real thing with my own eyes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The heart of <span style="color:#E16935">the British Empire</span>... I wish I could see it, too.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Then come with me! We'd have a wild time tearing up the streets of Her Majesty's City of London together!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If only it were that simple...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Oh dear, look at the time. I'd better be going.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright, I'll see you later. I think I'll stay and enjoy this place a while longer.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Good idea. After all, it's not every day you get to visit a high-class Western restaurant like this! See you in English class tomorrow, then...partner!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It was straight after that. That's when it happened...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>???:<br />
Asogi. May I have a word?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Professor! I didn't know you were coming. 
</p><p>???:<br />
Well, this case has personal significance to me. But never mind that for now. Asogi... You should go immediately to the judge's chambers.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
To His Excellency's chambers? Why?
</p><p>???:<br />
He was looking for you before. You advocating for the defence in this trial was a sudden decision. It seems there may be some confusion about procedures today as a result. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Who is this man? I feel as though I've seen him at university before...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I see. I'll go at once then. 
</p><p>???:<br />
I shall accompany you.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Alright then, Ryunosuke. I'll see you in the courtroom. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. Thanks, Kazuma. .........
</p><p>???:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh, this is awkward...)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
If I may...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, sorry?
</p><p>???:<br />
You must be the defendant. Ryunosuke Naruhodo, I believe?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! Yes, that's right!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
My name is <span style="color:#E16935">Yujin Mikotoba</span>. I'm a professor of forensic medicine at Yumei University.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, Professor Mikotoba... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I've heard that name from Kazuma before. As I recall, he's been pushing to get the government to agree to Kazuma studying abroad.)</span>
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Asogi has told me about you. You and he are <span style="color:#E16935">best friends</span>, I understand.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
As such, I feel you should know...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Know what?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well, as you've no doubt heard, Asogi has been granted permission to go and study in Great Britain. However... If he should fail to defend you in today's trial... ...I'm afraid that that permission will be <span style="color:#E16935">revoked</span>...and never granted again.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Ah, as I suspected... You were unaware of this. I had a feeling Asogi may have chosen not to tell you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(He's agreed to defend me, knowing that if he fails, his dreams will be shattered?)</span> But I don't understand! Why would the government do such a thing?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
The administration has to choose from a large number of applicants for overseas study. It's very difficult to persuade them to grant permission, even in the most favourable of circumstances.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't believe it... ......... But I... I didn't do it! I swear it! I'm not a murderer...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I'm sure that's true. Nevertheless... I can assure you that proving your innocence will be no easy task. You see, there are certain...'<span style="color:#E16935">peculiarities</span>' about today's trial.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? What do you mean?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
You'll soon understand, once proceedings get underway.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! But... Then what should I do?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well... Naturally I'm not going to suggest doing anything that could lead to a conviction.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Right, so...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
As soon as the trial starts... ...the judge will pose a certain <span style="color:#E16935">question</span> to the defence. When that happens, you must answer before anyone else. You must say, '<span style="color:#E16935">I do</span>'.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
'I do'...? But, what will the question be? Surely...not...? 'Do you accept the accusations brought before you?'...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Of course not.
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Defendant! Court is about to begin. Proceed to the courtroom at once!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Ah, it would seem our surreptitious discussions are to be cut short. So allow me to summarise... Kazuma Asogi must not be the defence lawyer in this trial. Of course, as the defendant, the final decision is yours.
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
What are you waiting for? Do you want to be found guilty for failing to appear?! Get moving! There's no point in anyone advocating for the likes of you anyway!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This is it... If this trial goes badly... ...Kazuma's dreams of studying abroad are over. And what's more... ...I'll be found <span style="color:#E16935">guilty</span>...of <span style="color:#E16935">murder</span>.
</p>
<hr />
<center>And so... ...with absolutely no idea of what lay ahead, I embarked on that unforgettable trial. My one and only chance of proving my innocence, the trial that would decide my <span style="color:#E16935">destiny</span>!</center>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">22nd November, 9:00 a.m.<br />
Supreme Court of Judicature, Courtroom 2</span></center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
So this... is a courtroom... 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">The Supreme Court of Judicature</span>. No court in the land has more power. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't much like the look of those people sitting in the public gallery. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Lots of military and other uniforms in there...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The powers that be have demanded that this be <span style="color:#E16935">a secret trial</span>. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A secret trial?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
A trial that's closed to ordinary members of the public. Only military and government officials may attend. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? But why?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It'll become clear in time. But for now... ...you need to concentrate, Ryunosuke. It's about to begin.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The court will now hear the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
The prosecution is ready, Your Excellency.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
As is the defence.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Before we begin, there is one point of order I would like to confirm. Yesterday evening, the defence made a last-minute request for a change of advocate.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
That's correct, Your Excellency. I made the request myself.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Normal procedure is for the defendant's advocacy to be decided two days prior to trial. As this is an unusual circumstance, I am obliged to ask for final confirmation now. Who advocates for the defendant in this trial?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is it! This must be <span style="color:#E16935">the question</span>! Who's going to defend me? That's the question the professor meant. But then, if I say, '<span style="color:#E16935">I do</span>'... ......... I need to answer quickly! What should I do?)</span>

</p><p>Judge:<br />
What is the meaning of this unruly outburst? 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I would like to inform the court that, that... ...I, <span style="color:#E16935">Ryunosuke Naruhodo</span>, will be defending myself! 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You'll be... WHAAAT?! 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What are you playing at, Ryunosuke!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Professor Mikotoba told me everything. Just now, before the trial.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
He did what?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He said that your dreams of studying abroad would be dashed if you were to lose.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... How sad. It means you don't have faith in me. You think I won't be able to get you off.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No! It's not that, really! It's just that... Well, on the off-chance that things don't go well for me, I couldn't bear to be the reason that you...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... Yes. I knew that's how you'd feel. Which is exactly why I decided not to tell you. Tsk! Professor Mikotoba shouldn't have stuck his nose in.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. The court hereby recognises the defendant's desire to advocate for himself in today's trial.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Well, well... Does the accused admit defeat already? Renouncing his own counsel! Really!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Make no mistake, Counsel... This merely shows that the defendant's innocence is so apparent, he's confident he can speak for himself. Isn't that so, Naruhodo-san?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm? ...Oh! Yes, exactly! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Exactly what I WASN'T thinking! I'm not confident at all. In fact, my mind's a complete blank...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I realize you're in charge now, but still... Try not to look so bewildered.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Hmph. Well, for a mere university student to be brought before the Supreme Court... ...you must have perpetrated a most heinous crime indeed.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
As you are no doubt aware, this is the Supreme Court of Judicature of Japan. Accordingly, the very highest standards of conduct are expected of all present. Do I make myself clear, Defendant Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! ...Your Excellency!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It is therefore my duty to assess your <span style="color:#E16935">competence</span> for the task you have undertaken. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My competence? <span style="color:#0070C0">(What does that mean?)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
He's questioning your ability to do the job.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, he can't be questioning it more than I am!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, let's start with the very simplest of questions.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, um... Yes!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Kindly state before the court the name of <span style="color:#E16935">the victim</span> in this case.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well that's easy enough. I've heard his name more times than I'd care to remember. But... Wait. Ugh, I'm so nervous, I can't even remember that! What was it again?)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ryunosuke... Let me guess. Your mind's gone blank?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Erm... <span style="color:#0070C0">(You know me so well.)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
All the relevant information for this case can be found in <span style="color:#E16935">the Court Record</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but I can't even find that...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It's simple. You can access the <span style="color:olive"><b>Court Record</b></span> with a press of [R / E]. If you ever find you've forgotten something, just consult that. It's all in there.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I just have to press [R / E] for the <span style="color:olive"><b>Court Record</b></span>? Alright, there's no time to lose!)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
This is the list of evidence you've collected. Now try switching to '<span style="color:olive"><b>People</b></span>' instead with [R / RB / E]. You'll find details about the victim in here. When you're done, just press [B / Z] to go <span style="color:olive"><b>back</b></span>. So remember, everything to do with the current case can be found in the <span style="color:olive"><b>Court Record</b></span>. Now, you'd better not keep His Excellency waiting any longer. Go on.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The victim's name was <span style="color:#E16935">Dr John H. Wilson</span>.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Tsh huh huh... Well, at least you can remember the name of an esteemed member of your own university.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Dr Wilson was a visiting professor from England, invited to Yumei University three years ago.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed. Which is the reason why this case has such profound <span style="color:#E16935">implications</span>. <span style="color:#E16935">The British Empire</span>... ...is at present, our country's most valuable foreign ally. And as most of you will be aware, we have just signed a new treaty together, after lengthy negotiations.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
There can't be anyone who hasn't heard of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Friendship and Navigation.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
And yet despite these delicate circumstances, the blood of an Englishman has been spilt on our soil! You two are both undergraduates at the Imperial Yumei University, are you not? Murdering a professor from the very institution that provides your education... Have you no honour?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(But I didn't do it...)</span> 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
This case is coming under great scrutiny from our allies on the other side of the world. The court therefore wishes for a speedy resolution to this matter.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Hmph. In other words, our feeble government is scared of upsetting England's policy makers. And you're a convenient and expendable scapegoat to blame for this crime.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So that's why this trial has these unusual <span style="color:#E16935">peculiarities</span>, is it?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Exactly. Our government needs to convict someone as quickly as possible. All because the victim was <span style="color:#E16935">an Englishman</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, Dr Wilson was an Englishman... But nationalities and treaties won't make any difference for me here. The fact is, I was there at the scene of the crime...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
Oh dear, look at the time. I'd better be going.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright, I'll see you later. I think I'll stay and enjoy this place a little longer. 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Good idea. After all, it's not every day you get to visit a high-class Western restaurant like this! See you in English class tomorrow, then...partner!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The British Empire... Wow, it's incredible to think- ......... Wait. I've seen that man at university. I'm sure he's a visiting professor from Great Britain. I don't know his name, but still... I should go and say hello.)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So I went over to the professor's table... ...and introduced myself to Dr Wilson.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Now, then...let me pose my next question to you, Defendant Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, Your Excellency!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
How did this professor of medicine, Dr John H. Wilson, lose his life? State before the court <span style="color:#E16935">the cause of death</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(<span style="color:#E16935">The cause of death</span>... Well, obviously, that was...um...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ryunosuke... Remember that in court, every assertion must be backed up by <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
By <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>? But, how?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Find the piece of evidence that shows the professor's cause of death, and select '<span style="color:#E16935">Present</span>'. Do it now!

The evidence that clearly shows the victim's cause of death is of course...this!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And on what basis do you present this evidence?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, um... Because it was in the Court Record, of course!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Slow down. Why did you pick that? Isn't there something more relevant-looking?

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, well... According to this document, the victim suffered a '<span style="color:#E16935">he-morr-hagic death due to gunshot trauma</span>'.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Learn to read, you imbecile! That's <span style="color:#E16935">the post-mortem report</span>, I take it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry, yes! That's right. The, um, <span style="color:#E16935">post-mortem report</span>.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
In the West, a doctor dissects corpses to identify the cause of death in an 'autopsy'. But here in Japan, a police officer merely <span style="color:#E16935">inspects</span> the body, and draws conclusions that way.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, I see! <span style="color:#0070C0">(As long as I'm not going to be tested on any of this later...)</span>
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
This is a so-called <span style="color:#E16935">photographic print</span> of the scene of the crime. You can clearly discern scorch marks around the bullet hole produced by the powder explosion. In other words, we should assume that the victim was shot <span style="color:#E16935">at close range</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Counsel. The court will accept this modern scientific evidence into the record.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The photographic print of the victim has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So that's a photographic print. Well, that's something I've never seen before... It's clearly superior to a drawing. The detail is incredible...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. I am satisfied with your answers. Let us start the trial.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Certainly, Your Excellency. So, without further ado, in order to better apprise the court with the facts of the case... ...the prosecution hereby calls its first witness, who was there at the scene of the crime when it happened!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh... This is it, then...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Hmph.. I think I may have worked out what the professor had in mind. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The professor? You mean, Dr Mikotoba?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes. Clearly, you're the defence lawyer today, not me. But that doesn't mean... Well, I can still act as your <span style="color:#E16935">assistant</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Of course!)</span> When he was speaking with me before, he simply said: 'Kazuma Asogi must not be the <span style="color:#E16935">defence lawyer</span> in this trial.'
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Hm, he really has been sticking his oar in, hasn't he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Maybe, but...any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated, Kazuma!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Well, my first piece of advice is: Rein in that crazy look of bewilderment and control the cold sweats!

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Only if you rein in that crazy headband and control the cold stares first...)</span>

<p>Auchi:<br />
Witness. State your name and occupation for the court, please.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Of course. My name is <span style="color:#E16935">Satoru Hosonaga</span>. I am the head waiter at a Western-style restaurant called 'La Carneval'. Ahem! ...Ahem!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...are you alright? You seem to be coughing up some, er...
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
It's a regular occurrence. It really doesn't bother me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, it really, really should...)</span>
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
As everyone knows, the capital's south-eastern quarter was developed for foreign visitors some years ago. It's become a very fashionable district now, full of hotels to accommodate overseas guests. This grim crime occurred in one of the district's so-called 'restaurants' - an occidental eatery - three days ago.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Understood. Hosonaga-san, you will kindly tell the court everything you can about the incident.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
At once, sir.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
And no petty interjections from the aspiring lawyer boy, please.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, um... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Perspiring, maybe, but aspiring...?)</span>
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
It was just after 2 p.m. on the day in question. We have few diners at that time of day. The lunchtime rush was over, and there were only three tables still occupied.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That fits in with my memory of it, too. There was hardly anyone else in the place.)</span>
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Ahem! ...Ahem! It was when I was in the kitchen, putting away crockery and cutlery... A gunshot rang out, so I hurried out to the dining area to see what had happened. I found the victim - an English gentleman - slumped in his chair. And standing immediately beside him, gun in hand, was the accused university student.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Auchi:<br />
I believe I asked you to refrain from petty interjections. The court wishes to listen to the witness's report of what he saw, you amateur!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The next time you interrupt at an inappropriate time, you will be <span style="color:#E16935">penalised</span>, Defendant Naruhodo.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Don't worry, Ryunosuke. You'll have your chance to fight back. For now, we must just quietly listen to the witness.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
If I may confirm one point, waiter... Standing beside the victim with a gun in his hand was the same man we see here in court today?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes. Without question. 
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
I see. And apart from the accused, was there <span style="color:#E16935">anyone else</span> standing beside the victim?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
No. There was no one else around that table but the deceased Englishman and the university student.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Wait, what did he just say? '<span style="color:#E16935">There was no one else around that table</span>'?)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What's the matter, Ryunosuke?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's... That's just not right! When I went over to Dr Wilson to say hello... ...there was <span style="color:#E16935">a woman</span> sitting opposite him at his table!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Really?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And that's not something the waiter could have missed! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I've been warned about interjecting, but still... What should I do?)</span>

Ryunosuke... If your parents tell you to study, you're the kind of man who would diligently get to work, aren't you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I suppose I am. I'd never have got into Yumei University otherwise.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
But you can't just always follow the rules in life, you know. If you don't say what you want to say right now, you'll seriously regret it when you're found guilty.

</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Dear me, dear me. What are we going to do with you? With your blatant disregard for court proceedings, I'm beginning to wonder if you're not a fraud. Could it be that the accused - this mere student - is not a real lawyer after all?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...I'm sure of what I saw!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Hosonaga-san, is there any chance you're mistaken? Perhaps your <span style="color:#E16935">memory</span> of events is hazy?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
......... No. The deceased gentleman came to dine alone.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I don't believe it...
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Ahem! ...Ahem! I actually have a rough plan of the restaurant as it was that day. Please, have a look if you'd like to.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Let me see... Ah, <span style="color:#E16935">a sketch</span> of the establishment's layout drawn by yourself, I presume?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
That's right. I'm afraid I used the back of my business card. It was a...turbulent situation. However, as you can see, the gentleman in question was seated alone.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, you're clearly a very conscientious waiter.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Thank you, sir.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The court will take this plan and add it to <span style="color:#E16935">the Court Record</span> as evidence.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Oh, um... Well...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Is there a problem? Hand the plan to the court officer at once!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Um...of course. Here you are.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What was that about? He's been completely calm and collected until now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Something certainly seems to have <span style="color:#E16935">shaken</span> him...)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The waiter's business card has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
So...the court has now heard a precis of the case.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, at the moment the gunshot was heard in the restaurant... ...the only person <span style="color:#E16935">in close proximity</span> to the victim was the defendant on trial today. It would seem we are looking at a black-and-white case here.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Defendant Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, Your Excellency?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If you admit your guilt at this stage, the court is willing to look mercifully upon you.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
In other words, you may have some small reprieve in terms of your inevitable punishment. I called this waiter as an unsworn witness in order to explain the details of the case to the court. But I must warn the defence, if you are determined to pursue matters further in this trial... ...the prosecution has decisive evidence from sworn <span style="color:#E16935">witnesses</span> who were present at the scene of the crime.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... What do you think I should do, Kazuma?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, I'm going to be found guilty one way or another, it seems. Wouldn't it be sensible to plead guilty at this stage and hope for a more lenient sentence?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Everyone keeps telling me that this trial is unusual - about these...'<span style="color:#E16935">peculiarities</span>'. You've said it, Professor Mikotoba's said it...and so has the judge and the prosecution. I'm... I'm scared of what lies ahead if I push this.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... As I said from the outset, I believe you're innocent. I trust you. And yet, despite knowing that... ...you're willing now to throw that trust back in my face? Is that it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
If the accused is in fact innocent... ...then a defence lawyer is duty-bound to prove that innocence by whatever means necessary. Are you just going to abandon that duty? Are you going to give up on yourself? The battle hasn't even begun yet, Ryunosuke.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The defence pleads not guilty, Your Excellency! We invite the prosecution to stop making empty threats and bring out its <span style="color:#E16935">witnesses</span>. Then we'll see just how decisive this evidence really is!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed. Prosecutor Auchi, please continue with proceedings.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Tsk, well, you were warned. The young can be so reckless. You know, many call me a saint. But I can be a devil when I want to be.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
In a few short moments from now... ...that dumbstruck young mouth of yours will be silenced, forever! The prosecution calls its next witnesses!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. Officer! Bring forth the witnesses at once!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Auchi:<br />
Witnesses, kindly state your names and occupations for the court.
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
Yessir! The great Nippon Imperial Army's Sergeant <span style="color:#E16935">Iyesa Nosa</span> reporting for duty, sir!
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
Myself, I find employ as a purveyor of fine articles of antiquity from the efflorescence of our nation, Nippon... ...and conduct my trade from Rasu-tei, a humble premises in the second district. <span style="color:#E16935">Kyurio Korekuta</span>, at your service.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
An antique dealer and a soldier... What an unusual pairing!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Both of these gentlemen were present at the restaurant on the day in question.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
They must be the diners at the other table that the waiter mentioned.
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
Myself, I habitually take tea of the most exquisite aroma at the establishment in question. Always post noon. And, not infrequently, converse with interested parties regarding the curios with which I make my business.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I can't understand a word that old man is saying...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
He's an antique dealer. And it sounds like he's a regular at La Carneval. He seeks out potential customers who may have an interest in antiques and tries to sell his wares to them. He obviously targets La Carneval because it's a high-class restaurant with rich clientele. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Right, I see. Although, to be honest... ...that sergeant looks more like he'd be a seller rather than a buyer.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Now, you both witnessed <span style="color:#E16935">the precise moment</span> of this most atrocious incident. Is that correct?
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
Affirmative! The enemy unit was seen attacking the foreigner in what can only be described as an act of war! Sir! It was that black-uniformed rogue infantryman over there who unloaded his firearm, sir!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This man's as impossible to understand as the other... But I'm almost sure I heard a strange noise during that last thing he said...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So, this is the decisive evidence the prosecution was threatening. The soldier is claiming that he actually saw <span style="color:#E16935">the precise moment</span> you shot the victim dead. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Well? Are you starting to feel uncomfortable?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If I'm honest...I was feeling uncomfortable from the start.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, the court will hear your formal testimony, please. You will state everything you saw at the precise moment that the incident occurred.
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
Sir, yessir! Standing by ready to report, sir!
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
Hm... Unsavoury memories of a most acerbic afternoon...

<hr />
<center>Witness Testimony<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- What the Witnesses Saw -</span></center>
<p>Nosa:<br />
I was ingesting a regulation beef steak at the restaurant while having a tactical discussion with the old man.
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
Myself, I was extolling the virtues of a particularly fine golden curio to the military gentleman.
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
At that precise moment, a firearm was discharged! I observed the enemy's actions with my own eyes!<br />
The black-uniformed varsity cadet fired on the English civilian! And from the back, the cowardly little weasel!
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
I was on my hands and knees, investigating the where-abouts of my mysteriously absconded precious curio.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Well! So you, Sergeant Nosa, actually witnessed the vital moment! You saw the split second when the defendant fired the weapon at the victim.
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
Yessir! Affirmative, sir! That wicked university cadet, sir! The cruel and unforgivable enemy!
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
What times we live in, when an English gentleman may be assailed in the broad light of day...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but this is ridiculous! I didn't shoot anyone!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Is that really true, Ryunosuke?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! All I did was pick up the gun that I saw lying on the floor! After I'd said hello to Dr Wilson, I went back to my table and sat drinking more coffee. Then, when I'd finished, I got up from my seat to leave the restaurant... ...when I noticed an English-made <span style="color:#E16935">gun</span> next to the chair where the professor was sitting. I thought perhaps the professor had dropped it. So I bent down, and just as I was picking it up...
</p>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
Well, if that's the truth, there was obviously a criminal on the scene somewhere. And somewhere in these two <span style="color:#E16935">witnesses' testimonies</span>, there's a clue as to who that criminal was.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There is?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ryunosuke! You must exercise your right to <span style="color:#E16935">cross-examine</span> the witnesses!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Cross-examine?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Do it now!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
As we have heard, Your Excellency... ...there is no room for doubt in the testimony of these witnesses. The defendant is clearly guilty. It is time to bring this despicable student to justice!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Certainly, the testimony the court has just heard eliminates any vestige of doubt. Therefore, it is my grave duty to declare the verdict of this tri-

</p><p>Auchi:<br />

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The defence is asserting its RIGHT to a cross-examination! Whether or not you think he's capable of it is irrelevant.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
*Gulp!*
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Kazuma is so commanding!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. Let the defence conduct a cross-examination of the witnesses. 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Alright, this is where the battle really begins, Ryunosuke!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...I don't even know what I have to do in a cross-examination!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Isn't it obvious? You have to expose <span style="color:#E16935">the lies</span> in the witnesses' statements!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You didn't fire the gun, which means what that soldier said has to be a lie.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well yes, but...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It's just a case of proving it. And the key to doing that is <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Right... Evidence...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
All you need to do is present some decisive and indisputable evidence that proves the witness is lying. Now let's go, Ryunosuke! Don't let them beat you!

Alright then! <span style="color:#0070C0">(It's all or nothing...)</span>

Why, why aren't you saying anything? Is this some new interrogation technique?!

I...hadn't actually thought of what I wanted to ask...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Just ask about anything that catches your attention. Anything that bothers you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright then, um... This '<span style="color:#E16935">beef steak</span>' you mentioned. What kind of food is that?
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
Teeen-shun!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
Beef steak is a delicious cut of veal, vigorously cooked on a cast-iron grill and served piping hot. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
If food could receive medals of honor, beef steak would be almost as highly decorated as a cutlet!

Right! I see. Um, thank you, sir. So, next question... ......... This '<span style="color:#E16935">cutlet</span>' you mentioned. What kind of food is that?
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
Teeen-shun!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Cutlet is a delicious cut of veal tossed in breadcrumbs and deep fried in cooking oil! Accept your guilty verdict, atone for your crimes, and when you're released from prison, TRY IT!

Yessir, I will, sir! On the double, sir!

Sorry to interrupt, but... How about trying to stick to questions that are relevant to the case?

Oops, sorry! I'll do my best. So, next question... Is it just me, or do you keep hearing a sort of 'wah' crying noise...?

A koban, boy.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A 'koban'? You mean an old Edo coin?
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
The day prior to the incident, a treasure of exceptional value from the Hoei period entered my possession. I took myself to the restaurant the following day, with said item secreted in my bosom pocket... ...in the hope of an affluent cognoscente appraised of its indisputable value being present. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...you were hoping to sell your koban coin? To Sergeant Nosa, whom you met at the restaurant?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Yes, yes. It's quite clear where you're going with this, boy. You were about to assert that a penniless soldier would have no hope of purchasing a precious koban. Isn't that so?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um... Well...
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
You little upstart cadet! You want to add disrespecting a superior officer to your list of crimes, do you?! Blatant subordination!

In any case, the hour was already advanced beyond that of the midday luncheon. There remained precious few present with whom I could engage in discourse about matters of business. The gentleman aside me, who was grappling with his braised veal at the time, was my sole prospect.

Argh! I've had just about enough of your sauce, cadet! Who else do you see around here in black uniform, hm?

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, there's someone standing right next to me who fits the description as well, but...)</span>

What is it, Ryunosuke?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm, I'm not quite sure... It's something that the sergeant just said, but I can't put my finger on it. Something's <span style="color:#E16935">playing on my mind</span>...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
In that case, check back over the details of the evidence you've gathered in the Court Record. And if you find an inconsistency there with what the witness just said, then...don't hold back! Present the evidence to the court! Thrust it in the witness's face and make him choke on it!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
'On your hands and knees'? Erm, could you explain that, please?
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
That's right. Spurning the arthritis, I was, in order to retrieve the lost piece.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What 'lost piece' are you referring to?
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
The koban, of course! The exquisite <span style="color:#E16935">Hoei-era</span> koban coin! I had just been showing the rare treasure to the military man as he masticated his meal. After averting my eyes for the briefest of moments...it was there no more! It simply vanished!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
The koban... vanished?
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
Hence I began to acquaint myself with the intricacies of the floor, in order to locate it. And then it happened.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You heard the gunshot, you mean?
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
None other than! Though it was no concern of mine. I was frantically scouring the floor for the aforementioned lost treasure!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So, in fact... ...you didn't actually witness <span style="color:#E16935">the precise moment</span> when the incident occurred?
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
Indeed. Myself, I did not.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh... I have no idea what I'm supposed to do here!)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Listen, Ryunosuke... We know there are <span style="color:#E16935">lies</span> lurking in these statements. It's time to expose them.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I understand that. The question is...how?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Like I said before, the key to this is using <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> that you've collected. You can examine and <span style="color:olive"><b>Present</b></span> evidence while a witness is giving testimony by pressing [R / RB / E]. Go through each witness <span style="color:#E16935">statement</span> and <span style="color:#E16935">the details</span> about each piece of evidence, and compare all the facts. Somewhere in there, you'll find something that doesn't add up. In other words, <span style="color:#E16935">an inconsistency</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
An inconsistency...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
When you find a statement and a piece of evidence that seem to contradict each other... ...<span style="color:olive"><b>Present</b></span> your evidence with [X / Y / R], and rip the witness apart!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Just be careful, because if you assert a contradiction that has no basis, you'll be given <span style="color:#E16935">a penalty</span>. If you're dealt too many penalties, the defence's case will fall apart, and you'll receive a <span style="color:#E16935">guilty</span> verdict. So that's it. Peruse the evidence in the Court Record and find an inconsistency with a witness's statement. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright, I'll give it a try!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You can hear the witnesses' statements over and over again, as many times as you like. So keep your head, and be measured in your attack. Good luck...partner!

The victim, Dr Wilson, died from a bullet wound to <span style="color:#E16935">the chest</span>.

Ah...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Sergeant. According to your witness statement... ...the culprit shot the victim <span style="color:#E16935">from behind</span>. And that is the obvious discrepancy here. Well? How do you explain it?

Ooh...erm... Agh...um... Well, er... Hnn... Hnn...

<span style="color:#0070C0">(What...the...? What was that? Something just popped up from behind his back but he pushed it down again...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Certainly, there is a clear discrepancy with the facts here. Would you not agree, Sergeant Nosa?
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
......... Yes, sir... At this juncture, that...would appear to be indisputable. Until the moment I heard the firearm discharge, my eyes were... ...firmly fixed on the delicious La Carneval steak! Sir!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
WHAT?!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The last testimony the court heard has proven one thing beyond all reasonable doubt. The witness, Sergeant Iyesa Nosa... ...did NOT see the defendant firing a gun at all!

</p><p>Auchi:<br />
If you call yourself a lawyer, then you will respect the rules of the court and speak accordingly! We are not here to listen to your fantasies!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
It is evident beyond all reasonable doubt that the victim was alone at the time of the incident. The prosecution has photographic evidence of this fact. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Is this a photographic print of the scene of the crime, Counsel?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Indeed. Of the table at which the victim was dining, taken by an investigator immediately after the incident. As can plainly be seen, there is only one place set.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Certainly, based on the appearance of this print... ...it would be reasonable to conclude that the victim was not in the company of anyone else. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Arg... <span style="color:#0070C0">(This doesn't make any sense...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The court will add this new photographic evidence to the record. 
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The photographic print of the crime scene has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't understand... <span style="color:#0070C0">(What's going on here? It's just not possible that nobody else saw that <span style="color:#E16935">woman</span>.)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The waiter before said the same thing. He maintains that Dr Wilson came to the restaurant alone as well.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But that's not true! I...I saw her...! I swear that I saw a woman with him...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It would seem that we'll be able to telegraph the report to Great Britain on time after all. The witness testimonies we have just heard leave no further room for doubt.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
These are very sensitive political times, as we all know. The ink is still fresh on the treaty with Great Britain. To think that I, Taketsuchi Auchi, will have contributed to the amity of these two great empires is an honour.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p>
<center>Stand tall, Ryunosuke. It's not over yet.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
If what you say is true, then there's something going on here behind the scenes. And now is your chance to expose it. To draw out the truth. ...In your cross-examination.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I don't know, Kazuma...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The defence is entitled to cross-examine the witnesses. But make it quick. Understood?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Tsk. Rules can be so unbending at times.

No no no! It's not the same thing at all! For a start, I didn't fire that gun!

We have a difference of opinion on that. The opinion of a uniformed officer versus that of a fledgling cadet.

Consider this, Defendant... Just a moment ago, I blinked.

And yet! It is an undeniable fact that I did blink! So there you have it.

Yes, it may be true that I was holding the gun at that point in time... But I've told you already! That's only because I'd picked it up off the floor!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Well obviously, as the culprit, that's the only way you could explain it away.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I had just finished drinking my coffee, and I was about to leave the restaurant when... I noticed a gun on the floor at Dr Wilson's feet, so I picked it up. And at exactly that moment...

Sorry? What do you mean?
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
In your case, you found a pistol on the floor and picked it up, which precipitated this testing predicament. Whereas conversely... ...I failed to pick up the koban from the floor, and find myself in an equally testing predicament as a result.

Unfortunately, it was already past 2 p.m. when it happened. The quiet time between lunch and dinner in any restaurant.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I know... Of course the place was almost empty. It's what you'd expect...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Certainly, 2 p.m. is neither here nor there in terms of a time to eat. I wonder if there was a reason why the victim was eating at that time of day. And why he was alone. 
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Yes, Your Excellency, there was indeed a reason. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There was?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
This was found in the victim's jacket pocket.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What is that, Counsel?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
It is <span style="color:#E16935">a medical report card</span>, Your Excellency. It would seem that the victim had an appointment at a clinic prior to visiting the restaurant.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... Hotta Clinic? Yes, there would indeed appear to be an entry for the date in question. '19th November, Noon to past 1 p.m...'
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Hm, the very day of the incident. 
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
So the victim went for a late lunch following his appointment. The explanation couldn't be more simple. The prosecution felt no need to submit this evidence before, as it really has no bearing on the case.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I wonder... What do you think, Ryunosuke?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm? Well, it is hard to see how it could be related, really.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(I clearly remember... There was a woman sitting across the table from the professor.)</span> Perhaps one of you might not have noticed... ...but for both of you to have failed to see the professor's dining companion? It's just not possible!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry...?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The waiter, whose testimony the court heard earlier, clearly stated the same thing. He also said that the victim was alone.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right...

Precisely! In other words... ...you are the sole proponent of this phantom lady!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Auchi:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Auchi:<br />
And if no such proof exists... ...the prosecution demands that no further mention of this phantom woman be made! It is a blatant waste of the court's time!

Listen. The first thing to do is calm down. You can't expect witness statements to be full of holes very time. So just take your time, and try to tease more information out of them first.

Yes. This is a brand new piece of evidence... ...so perhaps we should examine it in a little more detail.

You are not to interrupt court proceedings with your amateurish drivel!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Let's see if I can explain in words you might understand. It was after 2 p.m. in the afternoon when the victim was murdered at the restaurant. Whatever he may or may not have done <span style="color:#E16935">before that time</span>...is completely irrelevant.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Grrr... But, but that's...um...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Remember, Ryunosuke, you don't have to use clever language or fancy words. Just make your point.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Your Excellency, I believe we're finished here. There is surely no need to prolong this trial further.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm...
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
The witness testimonies the court has heard have been clear and concise. This medical report card has no bearing on the matter at all. For the simple reason that... ...there is no one else besides this pale-faced pupil who could possibly have perpetrated the crime!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This medical report card has nothing to do with the case? DO you really believe that?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Wha...? That outburst half petrified me, boy! Of course I believe it! How could it POSSIBLY be relevant?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Perhaps because Hotta Clinic, which issued the report card...is a <span style="color:#E16935">dental clinic</span>!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
A dental clinic? Is that supposed to mean something to me?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Perhaps if I told you that the victim...had just had <span style="color:#E16935">a tooth extracted</span>...?
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
...! What's this now...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And furthermore... ...if I told you that as a result, the victim had been <span style="color:#E16935">forbidden from eating</span>...
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
...!
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
...!
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
...! Just, just what are you trying to say, cadet? He had <span style="color:#E16935">orders not to eat</span>? So what?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's all written up in here. 'No food or drink other than water for three hours post-procedure while anaesthesia wears off.' 
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
WHAT?! No, that, that can't...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Korekuta-san!
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
What, boy? What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As you just heard... When he was killed, some time shortly after 2 p.m... ...the victim couldn't have been eating anything at all.
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
No...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Additionally...
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
There's more...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You have assured the court with unwavering self-confidence... ...that the victim was dining alone. But that cannot possibly be the case!
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
Grrr...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Because the victim, as we now know... ...had just had one of his teeth extracted, and was still experiencing the effects of the anaesthetic! 
</p><p>AAAAAAAAARGH!

Use your head. That's the very discrepancy we're talking about. Or can't you follow the logic?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
How, how dare you?!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I think it's fair to say that the 'tables' in this restaurant case...have turned. Wouldn't you agree, Ryunosuke?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm? Yes! Most definitely!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So having just undergone some dental surgery, the victim was unable to eat. Which leaves one very crucial conundrum... Who in fact was eating the pictured beef steak? The court will hear the opinion of the defence on this new puzzle. I assume you're ready, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........'Counsel'? Oh! That, that means me, doesn't it!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Alright, the answer to this question is going to be pivotal. This is the start of you <span style="color:#E16935">turning this trial around</span>! Show them what you're made of!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There was! Because I saw her!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
When the incident occurred, we know that the victim couldn't have been eating anything. Yet we have evidence of a half-eaten steak on his table! Therefore! The only logical conclusion is that there was somebody else there eating it.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Urgggghhhh...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
We have strong evidence to support our assertion. It's clear that these witness testimonies are unreliable. If the court decides to push through a ruling at this stage... ...we will lodge a formal complaint with the Ministry of Justice and pursue a fair retrial. Relentlessly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Kazuma...

Don't worry, Counsel, I have no issue with you.

Wha...?
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
What are you talking about?

We have demonstrated with evidence that the victim was not alone. So, if it now turns out that the two of you deliberately lied when giving your testimonies... ...obviously you will be charged with <span style="color:#E16935">perjury</span>.
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
Perjury...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And, since this is a murder trial... ...you will also be deemed <span style="color:#E16935">complicit</span> in the killing.

What, what is the meaning of all this? These witnesses...gave false statements? Is this true, you pair?!
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
.........
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
Just one... Just one simple slip of the tongue!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! Counsel, explain what is going on here!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It's painfully clear now... You tried to prevent these witnesses from telling the truth!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Absolutely not! The prosecution knows nothing of this!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then who's behind this?! Who tried to make you keep your mouths shut?
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
W-Well, um...
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
That's classified!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So you're prepared to be tried as a conspirator to this murder, are you?
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
You, you wouldn't... This can't be happening!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ryunosuke... Judging from the way they're reacting to this... ...I'd say they were sworn to silence by someone with considerable <span style="color:#E16935">influence</span>. However... ...I don't believe Auchi had any idea about it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What are you saying? I mean, to wield that kind of influence... There are only a handful of possibilities! <span style="color:#0070C0">(It could only have been <span style="color:#E16935">the government</span>, <span style="color:#E16935">the military</span> or... Or <span style="color:#E16935">the police</span>, I suppose...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Well? Any ideas about who might be behind this? If we can affirm who tried to silence these witnesses, then we can continue our pursuit! 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So we need to name whoever it was that tried to make the witnesses <span style="color:#E16935">keep their mouths shut</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Of course, we'll need evidence before we make any firm accusations. Evidence that proves whoever it was really did wield his or her power here... 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But how? How can we possibly...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Remember how we made progress before?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Before?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
We examined this piece of evidence in more detail and found a new clue as a result. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, yes, that's right.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Well, that's not the only piece of evidence we have, is it? We need to re-examine everything, and make sure there's nothing we've missed. There's no time to lose!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I want answers! If it's proven that these witnesses have been manipulated, I assure you, the penalty will be severe!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Please...wait... Your Excellency! I had no idea about any of this! I swear to every Shinto god! I knew nothing! 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And what does the defence have to say about all this? Hm?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Erm, well, Your Excellency! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh, no time to think...

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph. I'm not sure what this is supposed to prove, Counsel.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
I think, Your Excellency, that what this proves is not the true nature of the waiter... ...but the true nature of the accused.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
A blackguard, who would stoop to presenting irrelevant evidence to incriminate an innocent man. That is the true nature of this rookie!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Waaagh!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Try again. Go over all the evidence we have one more time. There's something in there that proves who this waiter really is, I'm sure of it!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Al-Alright then. I'll try!

<p>Judge:<br />
The plan of the restaurant sketched by the man in question? Hm, I agree it shows a great deal of attention to detail, but I'm not sure we can conclude anything-
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry, Your Excellency. That's <span style="color:#E16935">the back</span> of the card. It's <span style="color:#E16935">the back</span>...of <span style="color:#E16935">the back</span> of the card that's of interest.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I...beg your pardon?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Or, or perhaps I should have said, <span style="color:#E16935">the front</span>? Yes! It's <span style="color:#E16935">the front</span> of <span style="color:#E16935">the back</span> of the card! That's where the telling detail is!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......... Would somebody please explain what this overexcited student is trying to say?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Hosonaga-san sketched the plan of the restaurant on the reverse side of his business card. The front of that business card reveals the man in question's <span style="color:#E16935">profession</span>. His true profession.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The waiter's profession? But that's surely... Good... Good gracious!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
That's right, Your Excellency. The card reads, 'Chief Inspector, Primary Criminal Investigation Division, Imperial Police Bureau'. 
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
WHAT?! The, the waiter is...a police detective?! I, I haven't heard any mention of this before! Why haven't I heard any mention of this before?!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The Imperial Police Bureau has immense power. Absolute power, as far as regular civilians are concerned. So, witnesses there in the stand...
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
...!
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Was it in fact the waiter who gave you your orders? Was it he who told you <span style="color:#E16935">not to mention</span> that you'd seen this foreign gentlewoman at the scene?
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
Erm, well...
</p><p>Korekuta:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In-Inspector Hosonaga...!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I was worried something like this may happen. The moment you asked me to submit my sketch as evidence, I realised it was a possibility.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
The court will take this plan and add it to <span style="color:#E16935">the Court Record</span> as evidence.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Oh, um... Well...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Is there a problem? Hand the plan to the court officer at once!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Um...of course. Here you are.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, I remember now... He did act strangely when the judge asked him to hand over his business card.)</span>
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I strive to carry out all investigations flawlessly. It's my guiding principle. But I let myself be distracted when I made that sketch. It was an unusually careless mistake. 
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
So...you mean to say... You really are a detective?!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But why would a detective be working as a restaurant waiter? Ah! Of course! Your <span style="color:#E16935">salary</span> must be terrible!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I was working <span style="color:#E16935">undercover</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Undercover...?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes. There have been a series of <span style="color:#E16935">incidents</span> at the restaurant recently. In order to investigate, I decided to get a job there as a waiter, working undercover.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Incidents at the restaurant? What kind of incidents?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
That would be classified police information, which I am not at liberty to divulge. However, I can state categorically that they are unrelated to this case of homicide. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... Very well then, Inspector Hosonaga. But you will elaborate on one point for the court...
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Of course, Your Excellency.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
We have just heard new information from the two witnesses beside you. That at the time of the shooting, there was in fact another person present at the victim's table.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If that is indeed true... ...clearly you would also have been aware of this person's presence, having served at the table in question. However, your testimony did not allude to this other diner. Therefore, I am led to assume... ...that in your professional capacity as a police officer, you required these witnesses to be in agreement. Would that be correct?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Ahem! ...Ahem! ......... Correct, Your Excellency.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Unbelievable!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Hm, as I suspected...
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
.........
</p>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<p>Hosonaga:<br />
As soon as I heard the gunshot, I ran out of the kitchen to see what had happened. The victim sat slumped in his chair, and beside him, gun in hand, stood the accused student. Sitting opposite the victim at the same table was a young lady whom I guessed to be an Englishwoman. 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So the truth comes out.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I immediately sealed off the restaurant and reported the incident to the bureau. It was then that I received some...<span style="color:#E16935">special orders</span>. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Special orders? You mean to say...?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
'Remove the Englishwoman from the scene at once.' ......... It was made clear that the Englishwoman's presence at the restaurant was to be concealed. Those were my orders. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But! But what if this Englishwoman was the killer?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I think it would be in everyone's best interests not to pursue that idea.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
The empire views the friendly terms of its relationship with Britain more highly than anything at the moment. An Englishman has been murdered on our soil. To name an Englishwoman as the primary suspect... Well, without irrefutable <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>, that would be completely out of the question.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So that's the reason for the disappearance of the phantom woman in this case.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But it's not right...!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
.........
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... ...One possibility does spring to mind.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean, Kazuma...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yumei University is currently hosting a number of exchange students from Great Britain. And I'm fairly certain that one of them, studying in the medical faculty's research laboratory... ...is a young Englishwoman.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
...You're a shrewd man. I can see why you're the chosen candidate for the overseas study tour. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! You mean...?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
When I removed the woman from the scene of the crime... ...I thought it prudent to check her identity first. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Then the court demands that you name the lady in question at once, Inspector!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
The Englishwoman sitting at the university professor's table was a certain <span style="color:#E16935">Miss Jezaille Brett</span>. She is indeed a foreign student studying in the research laboratory of Yumei University's medical faculty.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Wha... What is happening heeeeeere?!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I admit that under orders from the police bureau, I erased all evidence of this lady's presence at the scene... ...and ordered these witnesses to make no mention of her in their testimonies. It must now be up to Your Excellency to decide how to deal with this situation.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......... Very well. My thoughts on the matter are as follows... Thus far, the case presented to the court has been underpinned by a particularly critical premise. Namely, that <span style="color:#E16935">the victim was dining alone</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
However, as we have now discovered that this premise is false... ...it would be a desecration of our justice system to ignore the truth and give a ruling at this point.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
But, but, Your Excellency! That would mean missing the noon deadline of a ruling in order to send the telegraphic report to Great Britain! Our own government will surely be very displeased by such actions.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Calm yourself, Counsel. I will not allow the government of our country or any other to influence the proceedings of my courtroom. 
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Ugh!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Inspector Hosonaga...
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes, sir?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You will locate this Jezaille Brett and escort her to the courtroom with the utmost urgency.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
At once, Your Excellency.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
But, but that means you'll be going against the special orders you were given from the police bureau!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
......... As I said before... ...it is my guiding principle to carry out all investigations flawlessly. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So, it won't be a problem?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Ahem! Ahem! Ahem, ahem! Nothing will get in my way!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Court will adjourn briefly. The prosecution must call the English student, Jezaille Brett, to the witness stand. Do I make myself clear?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Yes... ...Your Excellencyyyyyyy! 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good. Then we will have a thirty-minute recess before reconvening.

<p><br />
Kazuma:<br />
Excellent work, Ryunosuke! That was superb!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... My heart was in my mouth the entire time.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It was almost unbelievable. I mean, looking at you in there... You were drenched in sweat, your eyes popping, your knees knocking AND you were grinding your teeth. It was a grim sight, but before I knew it, you'd started finding inconsistencies in the testimonies. I think you might have a natural talent for being a lawyer.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Forget it! It's terrifying! If I get through this, I don't ever want to see the inside of a courtroom again!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ha ha ha ha hah! Anyway, it looks like we've exposed your phantom lady at least.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Miss Jezaille Brett... A student from Great Britain...is she?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's what I was trying to tell everyone from the start. Dr Wilson wasn't alone! There was a young woman with him. Like I've been saying all along! 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes, you have, haven't you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I might not be overly confident in the courtroom, but my <span style="color:#E16935">powers of observation</span> are one thing I am sure of.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes, I can see that. So...about this young gentlewoman... Thanks to our detective friend, she was hastily escorted away from the scene, it seems. Did you see what happened with that?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, I didn't see any of it. I was just on my way out of the restaurant myself. Then, on the floor next to Dr Wilson's table... ...I noticed there was a gun lying on the floor. And just after I bent down and picked it up...
</p>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I didn't have time to think about where the sound of the gunshot had come from. The waiter ran over to me, looking as white as a sheet... ...and he bundled me into some sort of small pantry next to the kitchen.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Fast thinking by the detective. He apprehended his suspect without a moment's delay.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, and because I was shut in the pantry... ...I have no idea what happened outside in the dining area.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Hmm...
</p><p>???:<br />
Ah, there you are. Well done, both of you.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Professor Mikotoba!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well... It seems I was right. The pair of you make an outstanding team. You've exceeded my expectations, I have to say.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes...it seems you planned this from the start. You arranged things so that I wouldn't be able to act as a lawyer in this trial.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
......... Our modern country is still in its infancy. Our justice system, even more so. Which is why... ...I firmly believe that we need to send our brightest young stars overseas to learn all they can. I wanted to avoid a situation that may have resulted in your study tour to Great Britain being cancelled.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... Well, it makes no difference. Lawyer or otherwise, if I'm the kind of man who can't help his best friend avert the worst crisis of his life... ...I shouldn't waste everyone's time by going to study overseas anyway.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! What are you saying, Kazuma?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Hmph. So that's your stance... I was afraid you'd feel that way.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Kazuma!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well then, it looks like it all comes down to you, young man.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
To, to me?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Yes. You need to prove your innocence, and uncover what really took place in that restaurant. I  must say, I very much want to know the truth. After all, I have a personal connection to this case.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Come to think of it, he said the same thing earlier this morning, didn't he?)</span> Um, if you don't mind me asking, Professor... ...did you know the victim?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Yes, I did. As you're probably aware, Dr John H. Wilson was a visiting professor at Yumei. And it was I who invited him.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! I, I see...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I...didn't know that before. 
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Anyway, you're about to go into battle. The victim was a university professor from Great Britain. And a well known one at that. Naturally our government is looking to identify and punish the culprit as quickly as possible.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
But let's not forget who we're going up against. The 'gentlewoman' whose involvement our police bureau went to extraordinary lengths to hide.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Yes, and I'm sure the prosecution will be using every tool at their disposal to quash your case. But I've no doubt that you pair will put up a good fight, right to the last. Best of luck!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Thank you!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Now then... ...I need you to run an errand at the university at once. There's something I think we may need. 
</p><p>???:<br />
Of course. Good luck...Kazuma-sama.
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Defendant Naruhodo! Court recess is over. Please make your way back inside the courtroom at once!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It's time. Let's get back to it, partner. Let's go in there and deal a decisive blow before those old fossils know what's hit them!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Um, Kazuma...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Thank you. Really.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What for?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, if you hadn't said you believed me, then... ...I'm fairly sure I'd already have been found guilty by now.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Look, I have faith in you. As a lawyer, and as a friend.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Coming from you, that means a lot. <span style="color:#0070C0">(If I'm found <span style="color:#E16935">guilty</span> in this trial... ...he's really going to give up on his dream of studying abroad. That's the kind of true friend he is. So this isn't just my battle any more. Whoever we're up against, we absolutely cannot afford to lose!)</span> Alright then... ...I'll save the thank-yous for after the trial.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You can treat me to one of those sukiyaki meals I like from 'Yumei Cafeteria' on University Street. With an extra large portion, of course!

<center><span style="color:green">22nd November, 12:09 p.m.<br />
Supreme Court of Judicature, Courtroom 2</span></center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
The court hereby resumes the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Prosecutor Auchi, have you managed to subpoena the witness?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Yes, Your Excellency! Against all odds. And thanks to a certain young stripling, the prosecution is now under rather painful scrutiny from the government.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... Sorry...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Let the government scrutinise. That's their job. It's nothing to worry about.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
It's highly unlikely that the good relations we've forged with Great Britain will emerge from this trial unscathed. Will you still think it's nothing to worry about when the new treaty breaks down and our nation founders?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Again... Terribly sorry...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
If the friendship between our nations is really so fragile, then the treaty isn't worth the paper it's written on. You really have nothing to worry about, Ryunosuke.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
A secret trial, anxiety over some foreign government's opinions, a bungled investigation, missing witnesses... Is this what our nation's justice system is? Is this the Supreme Court of Japan, or of England?!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Shut up! Shut up, you jumped-up rookie boy! You and your friend know nothing! Nothing of the situation our nation finds itself in! By aligning ourselves with this great world power, we'll become strong! Diplomacy has never been more critical! Steady political manoeuvring is what will secure our futures!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I won't deny that I'm no expert. I'm just a student. And one who could arguably study harder, too. But standing here now in our Supreme Court, there is one thing that I feel very strongly: A country that fails to uphold the truth in its justice system is a country with no future at all.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Well said, Ryunosuke. Despite the wide-eyed look of terror.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
You little braaaaats!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Counsel. This court is the pinnacle of our nation's justice system, and exists solely for the pursuance of truth. With that in mind, this trial will now resume with the next witness taking the stand. The visiting student from Great Britain, <span style="color:#E16935">Miss Jezaille Brett</span>!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Yes... ...Your Excellencyyyyyyy!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Auchi:<br />
Well, what a delight it is to welcome such a fine gentlewoman to Japan! And from such a distant land!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Tea! Someone bring English tea! In England, no discussions take place without tea!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Is that true?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...No idea.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
So, erm... Ahem! Could we possibly trouble you to state your name and occupation for the court?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Of course. My name is <span style="color:#E16935">Satoru Hosonaga</span>. I have been working undercover as the head waiter at La Carneval, but my true-
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Yes, yes, we know all about you already!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Inspector Hosonaga! Where are your manners? In England, it's always ladies first!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Is that true?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...No idea. More importantly, a little earlier today you said something to me. You said your powers of observation are the one thing you're sure of.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, yes... I think I did, didn't I?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yet your description for this <span style="color:#E16935">amazing sight</span> was simply 'a woman'. Sorry, Ryunosuke, but powers of observation aside, your powers of description are sorely lacking.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Guilty.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
So, dear lady, once again, if we may trouble you for your name and occupation, please.
</p><p>???:<br />
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........
</p><p>.........
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Um, I'm terribly sorry, dear lady, but...what?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
<i>[Foreign text]</i>?
</p><p>???:<br />
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
The lady says her name is <span style="color:#E16935">Jezaille Brett</span>. She comes from London, England. She's <span style="color:#E16935">a visiting research student</span>, currently enrolled in Yumei University's medical faculty.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Oh, my! What a rare treat to hear the dulcet tones of the delightful language of the British people! I'm afraid I don't understand a word you said, but it was as beautiful as a hummingbird's song! 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
As far as I can tell... ...the detective is translating her words faithfully enough.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I agree. Haha, you'll obviously do fine in England, Kazuma. Her English doesn't rattle you at all, does it?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Nor you. You've clearly been paying attention in your English classes, Ryunosuke.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The court thanks the beautiful lady for taking the stand. Now...if we may trouble you to confirm something, Miss Brett.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Three days ago, at a restaurant called La Carneval, a grim murder took place. The court has been led to believe that you were dining there with the victim, Dr Wilson, at the time. Is that correct?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
<i>[Foreign text]</i>?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
She says...'Yes.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This could take some time...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So even though <span style="color:#E16935">she's studying here in Japan</span>, she can't speak any Japanese?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
<i>[Foreign text]</i>. <i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
She'd like to apologise for disappearing from the scene. She says that she was due to make a presentation at the university, so she had to leave immediately. 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Interesting, when you're the one who engineered her escape...
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I was just following special orders from the bureau.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Well now, dear lady, would you be so kind as to cast your eyes over this photographic print? Seeing as you were, so unfortunately, present at the scene of the crime... ...could it be that your resplendent eyes <span style="color:#E16935">caught sight</span> of the wicked perpetrator, perhaps?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Apparently it was a very frightening...and sorrowful sight.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Do you mean to say...?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes. It would appear the lady did witness the crime. <span style="color:#E16935">The very moment</span> when <span style="color:#E16935">the accused</span>, standing right there in this courtroom... ...shot the victim in cold blood!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order in court!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Did, did you hear that, Your Excellency? Here we have an absolutely conclusive witness statement!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Well, it looks like it's clear now. Clear who our real <span style="color:#E16935">enemy</span> is!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Unfortunately, I will have to ask you to formally testify, if you please. Kindly tell the court the exact nature of this frightening and sorrowful sight you described.

'I had arranged to meet for a slightly late luncheon with Dr Wilson that day.'<br />
'The professor was unable to eat, so I ordered for myself only. A beef steak.'

</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />

'I don't carry a gun myself, so obviously I couldn't have been the culprit.'

Hmph. This is a condemning testimony indeed.

</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Quiet, you filthy wretch! Look at you, you black-hearted blackguard! And look at this snow-white angel! I'm sure even a dark-minded scoundrel like you can imagine whose words the court is going to believe!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You're still making the same mistakes, Ryunosuke. You mustn't blurt out when you're goaded like that. That's a lesson you need to learn.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh, but he's so annoying!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Of course, I was at the scene as well. I took statements from this lady and the two witnesses who testified before, and reported back to the bureau. It was decided that Miss Brett was not involved, so I let her go.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The testimonies of the last two witnesses were completely worthless, however.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Well, even so... On the day in question, the lady was wearing the same outfit as she is today. As you can see, there is nowhere about her person where she could conceal a firearm. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I would think she could hide a gun almost ANYWHERE in that outfit if she wanted to...)</span>
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Unless and until the precise <span style="color:#E16935">location</span> where the witness is to have hidden a weapon can be shown, this is moot.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
'There are no pockets in my outfit. I have nowhere to hide a gun.' Those are the witness's own words on the matter.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Argh! That's ridiculous! If only I was allowed to lift up her dress, I could prove it!)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Don't think about doing anything rash, Ryunosuke.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But I didn't fire the gun I picked up! There must have been another gun there that day!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You're right about that. Which means...this lady was hiding a gun somewhere... Yes, that's what we have to <span style="color:#E16935">prove</span> now. And to do so, we will need to pull her testimony apart.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The defence may now cross-examine the witness.

Oh! Yes, Your Excellency!

</p><p>Auchi:<br />
You don't keep up with the latest fashions from Britain, do you? Late luncheons are en vogue. Isn't that right?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
<i>No.</i>
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Hm, a decisive English 'no' has quite a sting to it.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
The gentlewoman is currently working in the victim's research laboratory, it seems. So it was apparently a daily occurrence that they would lunch together.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
But on the day in question, the victim had another appointment at the clinic first.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, which we can prove from the medical report card that was submitted as evidence earlier.)</span>
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
That's right. Miss Brett and the victim went to lunch following the victim's treatment, which is why it was so late.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, yes, that all makes perfect sense.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Such wonderful logic! What a shining example of English intelligence this fine gentlewoman is!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So you both arrived at the restaurant. What happened next?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He was unable to eat, you say. And that was because he'd just had a tooth removed at Hotta Clinic, correct?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
That's right.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Um, you're supposed to actually check with the witness before answering...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Was Miss Brett aware of that fact?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
It seems so, yes. She'd heard that the professor was to have some dental treatment.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So that would mean... ...that it WAS you who ate the steak pictured here. Is that right, Miss Brett?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
That's right, yes. The print you have there shows the table exactly as it was left after the horrifying events.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">('Exactly as it was left'...?)</span>

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So the victim, Dr Wilson, had nothing to eat or drink at all?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
That's right. Other than some <span style="color:#E16935">carbonated water</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Just water?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes. The professor was unable to eat, but he had been given permission to drink water. So it appears that the diners toasted their lunch with a glass of water each.

Yes. Being the waiter, I poured the two glasses myself. I clearly remember doing so.

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And the beef steak... That was for you, Miss Brett?

'What a frightful place!' ...is the lady's opinion.

Every country has its own cuisine. As long as people have food to eat, what does it matter what it is?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Dirty?

Your baseless accusations could very well cause an international incident...boy!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It seems to me, that your accusation is just as baseless as ours.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Tsh huh huh! What nonsense!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
The lady is merely stating what she saw.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's all very well saying that, but can you prove it?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Absolutely. I verified it personally.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You...verified it?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes, immediately after the incident, I checked to make sure the lady was not carrying a weapon. I distinctly remember her saying, 'I'm not.' 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's...all you did? You just asked her?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Surely you carried out <span style="color:#E16935">a physical search</span>, Inspector?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
...No.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Why on earth not?!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
The honourable English gentlewoman clearly stated that she did not possess a weapon. There was obviously no need for any further probing into the matter!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Or...there was no permission given for any further probing into the matter perhaps?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Think what you will! But if you're going to continue with this preposterous claim that the refined lady was concealing a firearm... ...the prosecution demands that you support your assertion with facts!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
In other words, he wants <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Brett:<br />
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
The lady wishes to point out that of course she wanted to stay and assist with the investigation... ...but she was in a hurry to give a presentation at the university, so she was compelled to leave.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Not to mention the fact that your office had told you to get the woman out of there.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Not 'get her out of there'. I just urged her to leave. The lady would like to point out that she in no way meant to 'run away' from the scene of the crime. Which is why she is only too happy to cooperate and testify here in court today, of course.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Unlike a certain student who refuses to admit when the game is up!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
You could at least have the courtesy to pay attention when I'm goading you!
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Kazuma:<br />
So she's maintaining that you got into an argument with the professor, at the end of which, you shot him.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which is an out-and-out, totally unfounded lie!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Still, her statement is very compelling. After all, she's an elegant, refined, young and beautiful gentlewoman from Great Britain. In stark contrast to you, dressed from head to toe in a dull black school uniform.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm dressed exactly the same way as you are, except for the flapping red ribbons!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Well anyway, this is our only chance to expose her testimony as the fiction that it is.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
If we can't do that, the trial's over. Even you with your thick skin must be able to feel the murderous looks you're getting from around the room.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Only too well. I feel half dead already. <span style="color:#0070C0">(And the fact that I can't see a single inconsistency in her testimony isn't making me feel any better, either!)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The first thing to do is press her on any of her statements that seem even slightly off to you. Do that, and an opening will present itself. I promise you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I need to expose <span style="color:#E16935">the true face</span> of this exotic foreigner that's hiding behind the mask. That's what I should be aiming for in this cross-examination...!)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... That's it! Let me just confirm something, please. It's...to do with this photographic print. Just a short while ago, you spoke of this print showing the victim's table at the crime scene... ...that it was '<span style="color:#E16935">exactly as it was left</span>'.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
'That is correct,' the lady says.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well! That is... It's, um... It's odd! Very odd!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Dear me. What's odd is the defence's inability to express itself.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ryunosuke, what is it about the print that looks odd to you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well obviously, it's...it's the '<span style="color:#E16935">cheers</span>'!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
The...'cheers'?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Brett just told us that she and the professor said 'cheers' over a glass of water. But if that's true... ...there should be <span style="color:#E16935">two glasses</span> on the table, not one!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You're quite right, Counsel. There's only one glass pictured here!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />

</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Are we supposed to be impressed by this nit-picking over minutiae? What possible difference does the presence or absence of a glass make on the case?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Minutiae, you say? Could it be that the detective here removed a glass from the table to conceal the lady's presence?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Of course not! I would never do something so reckless.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But there should have been two glasses on the table! Or are you going to try to tell me you can clink with only one?!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
......... You're quite right. I certainly took two glasses to the table.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Inspector! What did the lady say?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
It would seem that it was Miss Brett who took the glass from the table.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
'It was all so terrifying, everything that happened. I panicked and thought I should try to hide the fact that I'd been there at all,' she's saying.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
<i>...Sorry.</i>
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
There, as I assured the court before... this is of no consequence at all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, please...
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
We must remember that this student had just murdered the lady's luncheon companion before her very eyes! Who could blame her for concealing a glass or two in her state of disarray?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's absurd!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Oh really? So do we take it that you are now going to accuse this vulnerable, young and beautiful woman of...mischief?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! No no no! This, this can't be put down to 'mischief'!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I'd like to know... ...exactly how the lady took the glass from the scene.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
It would seem that she slipped it into a small <span style="color:#E16935">handbag</span> she was carrying.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A handbag, you say?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes, Your Excellency. A small, handheld pouch commonly carried by well-to-do women in England. 
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
So, the beautiful lady has very graciously explained how and why she removed the glass from the scene now. However! The fact remains that this glass has absolutely no bearing on the case!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm...
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
This student has been trying to confuse the court with logical reasoning! But in the end, it comes to nothing. No more pretentious accusations! You have wasted enough time already!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed, the lady has offered a satisfactory explanation as to why she removed this glass. I think henceforth we can consider the matter to have no bearing on the case. Counsel for the Defence, are you in agreement?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, well... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't know, really...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
If you want to pursue this matter further... ...you're going to need to show that it has some <span style="color:#E16935">deeper significance</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, you're right. <span style="color:#0070C0">(So she took the glass away in her handbag. If there's a deeper significance there, it's...)</span>

Because! It's the property of the restaurant! It's not some harmless act of pilfering, like taking a bar of soap home from the public baths, is it?

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wait! The lady put the glass in her handbag, you say?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Yes. Do try to keep up. It's already been explained to the court that all English gentlewomen carry handbags for small items.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Let me see... A little while ago, Miss Brett stated the following... 'There are no pockets in my outfit. I have nowhere to hide a gun.' But! What she forgot to mention, was her handbag. In which it would be perfectly possible to <span style="color:#E16935">conceal</span> a gun!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You're right!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Well done, partner. I had a feeling you'd pick up on that, too.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
What are you insinuating, you vile blackguard?!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It's really very simple. The gunshot was heard when the defendant picked up the gun from the restaurant floor. As he didn't fire that gun, we can deduce there must have been another firearm at the scene. The true <span style="color:#E16935">murder weapon</span>, if you will.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
You, you can't seriously be suggesting...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Inspector Hosonaga!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Did you or did you not search Miss Jezaille Brett's handbag on the day of the murder?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
No, sir, I did not.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(As I thought!)</span> In other words, another gun - the one that was actually used to kill the professor... ...could have been hidden in Miss Brett's handbag!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Nnn... NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! Order!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
What is the meaning of this, Inspector?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
The meaning of what, Prosecutor Auchi?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Why on earth did you not have the lady open her handbag and show you the contents at the time? Thanks to your bungling incompetence, now she has to endure these...uncomfortable accusations!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Brilliant work, partner! Now we have a chance to expose the real woman behind the mask!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Do you think so, Kazuma?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Ahem! ...Ahem! AHEM! ...AHEM! ...AHEM, AHEM! Well, what a sorry situation. Clearly you have no faith in the police.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
As I said, I did not search the lady's handbag after the shooting. Simply because...it was unnecessary.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Unnecessary in what way?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I ought to thank the student lawyer, really. I have a piece of evidence here that I had completely forgotten about. This photographic print. This print is of a photograph that I thought would be prudent to take immediately after the shooting. As you can see, it clearly shows Miss Brett's handbag.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well I never! You can see right through to <span style="color:#E16935">what's inside</span>!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
That's right. Apparently, meshwork bags like these are the height of fashion in London at the moment.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm, so the contents are clearly visible.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Exactly. So there was no need to search the lady's handbag. If there had been a gun inside, it would have been immediately obvious.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh! 
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
As you can see, there's nothing to imply Miss Brett's guilt here. Thank you for helping to prove that, Naruhodo-san.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Uh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! Inspector Hosonaga, you will submit that print as evidence at once!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Certainly, Your Excellency.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The photograph of the handbag has been entered into the Court Record.</span>

I think you've had long enough to cross-examine the witness, Counsel.

The court has now been shown considerable evidence. As the photographic print just submitted into the Court Record appears to have no further significance... ...I am satisfied that there is no longer any room for doubt in this matter, and I must make my ruling.

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Is there really... Is there really no chance now of turning this trial around?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. I will now proceed immediately to the ruling.

Your Excellency, just a moment ago you said this: 'As the photographic print just submitted appears to have no further significance... ...there is no longer any room for doubt in this matter, and I must make my ruling.'

</p><p>Auchi:<br />
This is blatant straw-clutching! Look at this photographic print! All it shows is the handbag the gentlewoman was carrying on the day in question. There can be no 'problem' with this evidence!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You'd better know what you're doing, Ryunosuke.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... I understand your objection, Counsel. Certainly, the new evidence submitted by the detective has not undergone the court's scrutiny. However, I fail to see how we can glean any new information from this handbag. 
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Ha! My thoughts exactly! Really, the prosecution is becoming tired of this rookie's desperate wheezes!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, I am desperate! But this isn't a wheeze. There's something about this photograph which just <span style="color:#E16935">doesn't seem right</span>. If only I could put my finger on it...!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, I will grant the defence one final <span style="color:#E16935">opportunity</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But be warned that if I am unsatisfied by your response here, the trial will be over with immediate effect. Do I make myself clear?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, Your Excellency.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, take another look at the photographic print Inspector Hosonaga submitted before. <span style="color:green">You will identify for the court where in this print we see the 'significant detail' to which you have alluded!</span>

I know it's the handbag that stands out in this picture. But you need to look further. Examine everything. Otherwise you might miss an important clue. Always try to see the whole, and don't be blinkered by individual details. I know you can do it.

</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Dear me! I was pondering what new piffle you would come out with. A burn, you say? On the victim's wrist? Clearly that has nothing whatsoever to do with the magnificent lady's handbag!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes, that is a burn mark, you're right.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Go on, Inspector.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
The police coroner also noticed it when he was performing the post-mortem examination. It was deemed unrelated to the cause of death, so he didn't note it in his report.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
What did I tell you? In any case, we have no idea when the victim suffered this burn, do we? And no possible way of knowing, either.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The more I look at it, the more I find myself intrigued by the curious shape of this mark... However, as Prosecutor Auchi points out, unless a firm connection to the case can be shown... ...I cannot allow any further time to be spent on the precise details of this burn.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
<i>[Foreign text]</i>.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Excuse me, Your Excellency... It would seem Miss Brett has a lunch appointment with the dean and other university staff. She would like to know if she may be excused from the stand now.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Oh, of course, of course, dear lady! We shan't hold you up any longer! I'm quite sure His Excellency is about to give his final ruling anyway.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What's your thinking on this, Ryunosuke? Do you believe this burn does have something to do with the case?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
To be honest, I'm not really sure. But if I don't keep pushing, then it's all over. So I was thinking I should keep digging and digging... in the hope that I might uncover something useful.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... Yes, you're right. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I am?!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
If we can just link that burn to the case... If we can do that, we might be able to prise this shutting door back open again.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Just give up, Counsel! You can't possibly hope to do that.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed. I'm afraid that without evidence, I can't allow you to pursue what is little more than conjecture.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
But if we had evidence? Evidence that irrefutably linked the burn on the victim's wrist to the case. Then you would allow it?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I would, yes.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
To tell the truth, I hadn't noticed that burn. But as soon as you pointed it out, what I did notice... ...was the colour draining from Miss Brett's face.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Really? <span style="color:#0070C0">(I have to find some link between that burn and the case... This is the moment of truth. It's time to find some evidence that proves what that burn really means!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />

I would say, looking at the picture of the wound, that it wasn't suffered very long ago. And, although it's not a particularly large burn, it's extremely well defined, as the defence just pointed out. This was no mild burn, that's for sure.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Can you be more specific, Inspector?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Well, let's see... ...if the plate was at around ninety degrees centigrade, a burn like that would have taken around <span style="color:#E16935">three seconds</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It's inconceivable that the victim wouldn't have let out <span style="color:#E16935">a scream</span> of pain, then.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I've been investigating at the restaurant for several weeks already, but I've not heard anyone scream at all. As the head waiter of La Carneval, I can testify to that without hesitation.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
But you... You're a detective, not a waaaiteeer!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There you have it! Something isn't right here! As the detective said... ...anyone who burnt themselves on a piping hot plate for three whole seconds would scream in pain. There's no question of that.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And yet Inspector Hosonaga never heard the professor scream. Not on that day, or any before it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right. And the strange thing is... ...on the day he was shot, I <span style="color:#E16935">didn't hear</span> him cry out, either.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What are you suggesting?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, if the professor had carelessly laid his wrist on the plate for anything like three seconds that day...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That would be beyond careless, I think, Counsel.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...then the rest of us in the restaurant - myself, the sergeant and the old antiques dealer... All of us would, without any question, have heard him scream. Wouldn't you agree, Prosecutor Auchi?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Hm? Um, well... Yes, I suppose...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So the question is... ...why didn't a single person hear Dr Wilson scream?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
...!
</p><p>...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I, I almost don't believe it! Ryunosuke, do you think...? 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Can it really be true? I never dreamt we'd arrive at a conclusion like this, but... I'm starting to think that maybe... ...we've been led into a terrible <span style="color:#E16935">trap</span>!)</span> There's only one explanation I can think of to make sense of this apparent impossibility. <span style="color:green">On the day in question, when he suffered the burn to his wrist, Dr Wilson...</span>

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No man could remain silent while his wrist was burning on a piping-hot plate for three whole seconds. That's clearly impossible. Apart from in one particular situation...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Counsel, are you suggesting...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, it's only possible...if the man was already <span style="color:#E16935">dead</span>.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
A-Already...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Dead?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Knowing what we know now, it's the only possible explanation. When the beef steak was brought to Dr Wilson's table that day... ...the professor...was already <span style="color:#E16935">dead</span>!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
That's... That's... ...madneeessssss!
</p><p>Judge:<br /> 
Order! Order! Order, please! Counsel, explain this absurd notion at once! The victim was killed by <span style="color:#E16935">a gunshot</span>!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
That's right! That's absolutely right, Your Excellency. This, this is just another ridiculous ploy by the rookie student! But clearly, he has no grasp of the facts!

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
No, Prosecutor Auchi, it's you who has no grasp of the facts.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
I beg your pardon?!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
As soon as it became apparent that the victim had suffered that burn while at the restaurant... ...this whole case was turned upside-down. Or have you not grasped that yet?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Urrr... Ugh...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Your Excellency! The court MUST hear from this witness again. If it's true, as we now believe, that the victim was already dead before the gunshot was heard... ...it's highly likely that Miss Brett knows something about it!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />

</p><p>Brett:<br />
<i>Well,</i> of course I do. I am studying in your country, after all.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But...then...why have you been speaking through an interpreter until now?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
My mother tongue - <i>the Queen's English</i> - is the most refined and elegant language in the world. As a gentlewoman, I try to avoid speaking in your vulgar tone as much as possible.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
.........
</p><p>Brett:<br />
But it seems the men in this land possess none of the chivalrous virtues of English gentlemen. So I can see that I shall have to lower myself to communicating with you all on your own level.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Oh... Ah...well... You are the epitome of a true English gentlewoman! We are truly honoured by this... This lavish consideration you so graciously afford us!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......... I see. In that case, Miss Brett, I will now ask you to testify in your own words... ...about the events leading up to the death of the victim, Dr Wilson!
</p><p>Brett:<br />

So, we're finally going to hear her own words on the matter. Things are getting interesting, Ryunosuke!

<center>Witness Testimony<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- The Victim's 'Death' -</span></center>
<p>Brett:<br />
Unfortunately, I have no idea when the poor man burnt his wrist like that.<br />
When the waiter brought my steak, the professor and I raised our glasses in a toast.<br />
As far as I've heard, the post-mortem report showed no other possible cause of death besides the gunshot.<br />
If there's some other way a man's life can been <i>[sic]</i> taken without leaving a trace, please, do show me.<br />
But of course...this country's inferior investigative techniques probably wouldn't pick up on it anyway.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
...That most captivating and beautiful testimony will go down in the Supreme Court's history. Thank you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Easy does it...)</span>
</p><p>Brett:<br />
I hope that this is the last time I will have to sully my lips with the coarse tones of your unbecoming tongue. <i>Oh</i>.... Forgive me. I do hope I haven't insulted anyone.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Not at all, not at all! It is a delight merely to hear you speak, dear lady! And it seems very clear from your testimony, that this boorish talk of the victim's burn is utterly irrelevant.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
I will be speaking to your country's Minister of Justice about what has happened here today.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
The...Minister of Justice...?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
May that irritating little bully of a student be given the harshest punishment possible! ...<i>Amen.</i>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh? ...Um, thanks? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Was, was that a prayer then?)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Well you'll have to forgive the irritation, Miss Brett, and put up with a cross-examination now. 
</p><p>Brett:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I expect you've noticed that this 'little bully of a student', as you put it... ...doesn't miss much.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I'm sure I don't need to remind you, Counsel, that this will be your final cross-examination in this trial. If you fail to demonstrate any problems with this witness's testimony... ...I will be ruling on the case immediately. Is that clear?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Yes, Your Excellency.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Then you may proceed with the cross-examination!

Dr Wilson was a true English gentleman. He chose honourable silence over a vulgar scream. ...Can your tiny brains imagine such a thing?

Luckily for all of us, a little burn on the wrist isn't going to kill us. And as there were no other signs of trauma on the victim's body to indicate some other cause of death... ...it can only have been the bullet from your gun that put an end to this innocent man's life!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Yes, that's true. If it had cooled even slightly, it wouldn't have been able to make a burn like that.

Quite right, dear lady. And as our police force has thoroughly examined the body of the deceased, there can be no doubt. Isn't that right, Inspector Hosonaga?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
'Inferior'? What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
In the lands of the great British Empire, the police store everything found at a crime scene for later examination. But in this country, you investigate once, and that's the end of it. ...Isn't that so?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Quite right! La Carneval is open for business as usual today, just days after the incident!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Exactly. Which means that even if the investigation takes a different direction, vital evidence may be lost. It doesn't even occur to your naive detectives to try to preserve the crime scene. I'm...trying to be as tactful about this as I can, you understand.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Haha! A killer blow! The lady is as formidable as she is beautiful!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Amazing! He's actually admitting our police may be flawed. Perhaps Prosecutor Auchi is finally starting to see sense.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I very much doubt that.

'Inferior'? What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
In the lands of the great British Empire, the police store everything found at a crime scene for later examination. But in this country, you investigate once, and that's the end of it. ...Isn't that so?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Quite right! La Carneval is open for business as usual today, just days after the incident!

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, there it is again! The detective's <span style="color:#E16935">reaction</span> is just the same as before. Why...?)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Up until now, the detective has been in the stand with Miss Brett as her interpreter. But things are very different now. For this testimony, the detective is just <span style="color:#E16935">listening</span> to what the Englishwoman has to say. This could be <span style="color:#E16935">a golden opportunity</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
When people are actually testifying, they're usually very careful not to let anything slip. However... When they're listening to someone else speak, you'll find they often <span style="color:#E16935">let their guard down</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You're right... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Look at him! He's lost in his own thoughts!)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It's time to <span style="color:#E16935">pursue</span> the man and his train of thought!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? <span style="color:#E16935">Pursue</span>?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I'll explain how to do it now, Ryunosuke. It's all to do with the witness <span style="color:#E16935">marker</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What <span style="color:#E16935">marker</span>?)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
At the moment, we're <span style="color:#E16935">focused</span> on Miss Brett, who's the person actually making the current statement. But by moving <span style="color:#E16935">the marker</span> left and right with [D-pad / A D], you can <span style="color:#E16935">turn your attention</span> to other people in the stand. While you're looking at the other witnesses, you'll be able to '<span style="color:olive"><b>Pursue</b></span>' them with [A / Space]. If you can catch the person at just the right time, you might uncover some new information to pursue. If you ever notice a strange atmosphere amongst the people on the stand, take a good <span style="color:#E16935">look around</span>. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright then, so first I should <span style="color:#E16935">move the marker</span> across with [D-pad / A D], and focus on the detective. Then <span style="color:olive"><b>Pursue</b></span> him with [A / Space], and see what's on his mind! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Here we go...!)</span>

</p><p>Auchi:<br />
What is the meaning of this? It's the delightful Englishwoman who's testifying at the moment. If you can't find fault with her testimony, then the cross-examination should be over. Immediately! 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...is, is that how it works?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Absolutely not.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The detective is in the stand! Which makes him a valid witness.

Yes! Not to mention the fact that he's intimately involved in the case!

Inspector Hosonaga... 
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Do you have something to add? In relation to the statement just made by Miss Brett?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
......... Well, yes... If you don't mind, I would like to speak.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
.........
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
The lady is right. Our country's police practices are not as modern as those used in Great Britain. Which is why! ...I...Satoru Hosonaga! Always strive to make every investigation I'm involved in flawless!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you really mean by that?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I'll tell you what I mean! I won't have evidence lacking on my watch! I'm not afraid to take everything I can from the scene of the crime. It's preserving evidence, you see. I don't care if they call me a crime scene thief! I'm not ashamed of what I've done! Ahem! Ahem! Ahem, ahem! 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A crime scene thief...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Well, it looks like the lady's remarks touched a nerve there.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Take this, for example!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Is, is that...?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
This is the bottle of <span style="color:#E16935">carbonated water</span> that I took to the victim's table on the day in question. And yes, it's lost all of its fizz, having been opened three days ago now. But it WAS carbonated water! I don't care what anyone says!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, there's some left in the bottle! I can see it!)</span>
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
One day our police force will be among the best in the world! The time is coming! I guarantee it! Ahem! ...Ahem! Ahem, ahem!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I can't say I condone the witness's actions, but I do understand the sentiment. The court will accept the glass bottle of water as evidence! 
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The carbonated water bottle has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm...  Miss Brett... Can you confirm this is indeed the bottle from which you drank on the day of the victim's death?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
...Yes. It was that bottle.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What was that about? She seemed to avert her eyes when she answered the judge's question...)</span>

</p><p>Brett:<br />
It is you! ...Who should be silent.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Of, of course... ...dear ladyyyyyyyy!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Where did that come from? She, she just snapped!)</span>
</p><p>Brett:<br />
I'm afraid I may have spoken unfairly before. I offer my most humble apologies.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I'm sorry, my lady, to what are you referring?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
I described your police force as 'inferior'. But no matter how inferior they may be, you still investigated this particular point thoroughly, I believe? The bottle, I mean, Inspector. And whether it contained <span style="color:#E16935">poison</span> or not.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
......... Of course.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You, you did?!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Have you forgotten what my guiding principle is already? I strive for a flawless investigation every time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't believe it...!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Naturally we <span style="color:#E16935">tested</span> the inside of the bottle and its contents.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And...? What did you find, Inspector?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I ordered tests for every toxin that's available in this country at the present time. We could find no trace of poison of any description in the bottle of carbonated water, Your Excellency.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What? Are you sure?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
The tests were meticulously carried out by the Chief Coroner himself.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No... NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
I'm very grateful to all you Japanese. You've successfully established my complete innocence in this horrid affair. Thank you.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
But, but of course, dear lady! The pleasure was all ours!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I was so sure...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
This...can't be right! Everything falls into place if he was poisoned...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Counsel. I think that cross-examination has clarified everything. As the prosecution have asserted, a shot to the chest from this gun is the only conceivable cause of death. Furthermore... The accused, who by his own admission was holding this weapon, is the only possible culprit!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm done for...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The court wishes to apologise for the great inconvenience this has caused you, Miss Brett.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
<i>Oh no</i>... I'm just glad the matter is resolved.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Before proceeding, I must ask the counsel for the defence... ...do you have any further new evidence to present the court at this point?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Kazuma?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... I'm sorry, Ryunosuke. I have nothing more.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Well, if you'll excuse me now, I really must be leaving...

Supreme Court of Judicature, Courtroom 2</span></center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
Well? I understand you are the judicial assistant to the defence, but why this sudden ingress into my courtroom? 
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Ha! A judicial assistant? And a woman, no less! The rules state...that females are not permitted into this court of law other than to testify!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, I fully understand. I ask only for five minutes of time. I have some vital evidence that I must hand over to the defence.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Hah! You're too late, little girl! This trial has already been concluded!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Five minutes. I will not allow a moment more.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
But...Your Excellency!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I am most grateful.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, who exactly are you?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm sorry, there's no time. Please, simply accept this for now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What is it? A report about something... Written in English...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's Jezaille Brett's research.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! The Englishwoman's?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
After the trial resumed earlier, I hurried back to the university. I went to Dr Wilson's laboratory in the medical faculty and...borrowed this paper.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Oh yes, that's right. Miss Brett was studying under the professor, wasn't she?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...does this <span style="color:#E16935">research</span> - whatever it is - have something to do with the case?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm afraid I don't know. I haven't been able to listen to the proceedings of the trial myself. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh...no, of course not.)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
'Special Characteristics of Curare and its Effects on Human Subjects'... Interesting.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
'<span style="color:#E16935">Curare</span>'? What's that? <span style="color:#0070C0">(I've never heard that word before...)</span>
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Time's up. The prosecution demands the immediate removal of this female trespasser from the courtroom!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There was too little time for me to read it in detail. But I've summarised what I could on a note just inside the cover. If you think it could be valuable, please cast your eye over it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This is wonderful. Thank you!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Jezaille's report has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Goodbye, then. And good luck.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You have had long enough, Counsel. We cannot detain our English guest any longer.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I ask the prosecution and the defence now one last time... ...does either side have any further evidence to present to the court? I presume not, but...
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
The prosecution has made its case convincingly enough already. Nothing more to add, Your Excellency!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ryunosuke, we're out of options here. This really is our very last chance.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I know. Your Excellency! The defence does have new evidence!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......... Hm, that look... The unyielding stare of a true Japanese warrior... Well,  Miss Brett?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Yes, Your Excellency?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If you wouldn't mind, perhaps you could grace us with your presence a little longer?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
It's a delightful invitation. But I'm afraid... ...it's not so very long until tea time. I'll have to politely decline-
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Forgive me, Miss Brett, it seems I wasn't clear. I realise it was phrased as a question. However... ...I must ask you to treat that as an order.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
......... I've said it many times before, but... The Japanese language makes no sense.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
My apologies, dear lady. So, Counsel... <span style="color:green">What is this new evidence that demands the court's attention?</span>

No, that particular item does not warrant further discussion.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(It seems I've chosen poorly...)</span>
</p><p>Brett:<br />
In that case, I'll take my leave of you now and go for some afternoon tea. In civilised English society, tea time is an essential. We'd surely die without it.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Take your tea time now, Ryunosuke, and you'll surely die in a minute yourself.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh, I know...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You know there's only one piece of evidence the court hasn't seen yet! Don't squander this chance! Don't let our judicial assistant's great efforts go to waste.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Jezaille Brett... ...we understand you were studying under Dr Wilson at Yumei University. Doing research.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Research, by sheer coincidence, perhaps...into <span style="color:#E16935">a deadly poison</span>. 
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Poison?! Where are you going with this, Counsel?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
A toxin known as <span style="color:#E16935">curare</span>, Your Excellency. Even the slightest amount of this <span style="color:#E16935">deadly poison</span> entering the body leads to instant death.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
What, what complete and utter nonsense! Cu-<span style="color:#E16935">curare</span>, you say? I've never even heard of it!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You wouldn't have done.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I mean that you wouldn't have heard of curare before for one very simple reason... It doesn't exist in our country.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
It <span style="color:#E16935">doesn't exist</span>...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Correct. Which means... ...no matter what tests the police can do for toxins, they'd never identify curare. Why? Because there IS <span style="color:#E16935">no test</span> available here that can identify the presence of this highly deadly poison! 
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! Order! Counsel, does this deadly poison truly exist?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
According to this report authored by the visiting research student from England... ...curare has long been used by the tribespeople of South America as <span style="color:#E16935">a poison to lace their arrows</span>. It seems that it's reasonably well known among European doctors and scientists.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
To, to lace their arrows...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The report states that it is produced from the extract of a tree that grows deep in the Amazonian jungle. And it was first brought back to Europe at the turn of the century by explorers. It claims that animals shot by arrows laced with curare suffer <span style="color:#E16935">instant</span> death. Doesn't that about sum it up, Miss Brett? 
</p><p>Brett:<br />
.........
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Trumpery! These aspersions are utter trumpery! To start with! If the victim had been administered some of this so-called deadly poison... ...he would have been squirming and writhing in pain and the other diners would have surely noticed!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm, that's true. What do you say to that, Inspector?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Obviously I would have noticed a disturbance like that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hm, I don't remember anything like that, either. I didn't notice the professor being in any kind of pain...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
According to this, however...it's <span style="color:#E16935">the other way around</span>.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
What do you mean, '<span style="color:#E16935">the other way around</span>'?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The very fact that the victim didn't show any visible signs of distress... ...is <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> that curare was used.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Explain yourself, Counsel.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The moment this toxin enters a person's system, it causes instant paralysis. In other words, afflicted victims lose all strength and are completely <span style="color:#E16935">unable to move</span>. Even if they were in total agony, there would be no visible signs of pain at all.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
How terrible...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Obviously, if a man lost all strength in his muscles, he'd collapse on the floor. But with a chair under him for support, as Dr Wilson did, the effects could go largely unnoticed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But I don't follow, Kazuma. That's just paralysis. I thought the poison caused <span style="color:#E16935">instant death</span>.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... The full explanation is extremely unpleasant. The poison causes immediate paralysis, as I said, leaving the victim unable to move. But after a short time, the paralysis is so severe, it causes the muscles that control <span style="color:#E16935">respiration</span> to fail. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Respiration...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
In other words, the actual cause of death...is <span style="color:#E16935">suffocation</span>. And all the while, the victim is conscious and aware. Just unable to move.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
That's...hideous... 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
To the observer, it would look almost like the victim was slipping peacefully into an endless sleep. But for the victim himself, his final moments would be a living hell. That is the true nature of this deadly <span style="color:#E16935">curare</span> poison.
</p>
<center>.........</center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
And you're suggesting that this bottle, Counsel... ...actually contains this terrifying poison? 
</p><p>Auchi:<br />

</p><p>Auchi:<br />
This, this... This is all very convenient, isn't it? A hitherto unknown poison for which there is no means of testing? What a happy tale for the defence!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Ahem. If I may...

All these 'facts'... You think you're so clever! But you must be taught some manner-

......... So. This is how you Japanese behave, is it? 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? 
</p><p>Brett:<br />
You steal another's honest hard work and then announce the results as if YOU discovered them! I'm appalled! What a loathsome act!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Well, Miss Brett, the feeling is mutual. 
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Whatever do you mean? 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Capitalising on the unfortunate circumstances of an innocent man to frame him for a heinous crime? That really is a loathsome act. Wouldn't you agree?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />

</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Enough of this! I, for one, refuse to accept it! The idea of some poison that doesn't even exist in the great Empire of Japan is...is...breaking the rules!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
...Hah hah hah... 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's so funny?!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
<i>Oh, excuse me</i>. Your...Excellency...

Y-Yes, Miss Brett?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
May I borrow that bottle for a moment, please? 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Um, well... Yes, I don't see, um...why not. 
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Don't get too big for your boots, you insignificant little island boys. 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Sorry? 
</p><p>Brett:<br />
To an Englishwoman such as myself, this whole affair is a farcical comedy. Your little police games, and these foolish courtroom antics... It's laughable, really. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
But I'm getting bored of it all now. It's time for the games to end. ...<i>Cheers!</i>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What! Wha-What are you doing?!

So...no curare... 'The bottle was clean,' is that what you're saying? 
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Hahahaha... You look quite incredulous, little boy. But of course...that's the simple truth. Thank you for presenting the findings of my research so concisely here in this grand venue. Most kind.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Grrr...
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Thank you, waiter. Now then, Your Excellency... 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......... Ah! Um, yes, Miss Brett? 
</p><p>Brett:<br />
I should like to be excused now, please. I think I've given more than enough of my time...for the furtherance of friendship between our countries. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah, yes, dear lady. We are most gratified with all the assistance you have given. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We've been hearing a lot about this curare poison. And it's left me curious about something...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, it sounds as though indigenous hunters have been using this poison for years and years... ...to lace the heads of the arrows that they shoot at whatever prey they're <span style="color:#E16935">hunting</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So we've been led to believe, yes. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And...the point of hunting is to catch prey <span style="color:#E16935">to eat</span>.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Get to the point, please! 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...if they were to use these laced arrows... ...doesn't that mean there would be traces of <span style="color:#E16935">poison</span> left in the prey the hunters were going to eat? 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes! Good point! 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So surely the hunters wouldn't want to eat their prey, would they? Because then they'd be eating <span style="color:#E16935">poison</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious, Counsel! No, that would be madness!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But I actually found the answer to that conundrum in this research paper here. Under '<span style="color:#E16935">Special Characteristics</span>', it says this: 'The poison starts to work after entering the body <span style="color:#E16935">through a wound</span>.'
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Through a wound, you say? I see, that makes sense.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. The mention of that particular detail seemed a little strange to me, though.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But it all makes sense when you interpret what's written like this: When curare enters the body through an open wound, it has terrifying poisonous effects. However... ...when it enters the body via <span style="color:#E16935">the mouth</span>, it has no poisonous effects whatsoever!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Brett! You authored this research! You knew curare's special characteristics! And you knew! ...That you could make a spectacle of drinking that water without any danger to yourself!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
......... You...meddling...little... ...rapSCALLIOOON!

Well, Ryunosuke, it turns out... ...you're an even better lawyer than I thought you'd be.

So...the ill-bred little puppy has a new toy to play with. Some facts he read in a book. But I'm afraid knowledge doesn't suit you, little boy. It only makes you look silly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What are you trying to say?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Your schoolboyish logic has a fatal <span style="color:#E16935">flaw</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sch-Schoolboyish?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Flaw?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
As even your brain has managed to deduce, curare is safe to ingest. It seems likely that its effects are neutralised by the acidic nature of the gastric succus.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, yes, well...of course! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Gas trick suckers? What are they?!)</span>
</p><p>Brett:<br />
So, if this lethal poison is completely harmless when drunk... ...the professor wouldn't have died when he swallowed it...would he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
That's...right...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
That's basic science. Science that even a schoolboy should be able to understand, no?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order in court! Order! The logic holds. If the lady and the professor drank the same poison, they would be affected in the same way.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Are... Are you trying to suggest-
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Yes! This curare poison is completely <span style="color:#E16935">irrelevant</span> to the case on trial!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
That's right. Surely even a little cockroach like you could understand something as simple as that!

......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(What is this, welling up inside me...? I've never felt like this before.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh?!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Listen, Ryunosuke... There's no need to overthink this. We know that curare's toxic effects only come into play when the poison enters the body via a wound.

Right, so that can only mean...that when Dr Wilson drank his glass of water... ...he must have had a wound somewhere that let the poison in.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Exactly.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As Miss Brett so readily pointed out, she drank the same water as the professor. However...there was a fundamental and fatal <span style="color:#E16935">difference</span> between the two diners.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A fatal difference?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The toxic effects of curare are only felt when the poison enters the body through an open wound. So, for a healthy person with no injuries, drinking it is completely harmless. But... ...what if there was <span style="color:#E16935">a wound</span> inside the mouth of the person drinking the poisoned water?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Inside...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. Like the wound you might have... ...if you had just been to the dentist and had a tooth extracted, for example.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Brett! You've acknowledged many times in your testimony already... ...that you were <span style="color:#E16935">well aware</span> of Dr Wilson's dental appointment that day.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So that's it... You used that knowledge to orchestrate this...
</p><p>Brett:<br />
......... Heh...heh...heh...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is, is she...? ...laughing?!)</span>
</p><p>Brett:<br />
I don't like to repeat myself, but honestly, I can't resist. These childish courtroom games and your half-baked arguments are all so puerile. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What, what do you mean?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Don't worry, little schoolboy, you'll find out soon enough. You see, when you leave vital evidence lying around, you never know what might happen to it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
I mean, it could just...slip. Oh dear, how careless of me. I'm afraid some crucial evidence may have just been tragically destroyed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
N... NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
</p>
<center>What is it? What just happened?</center>
<center>It's the Englishwoman! She just smashed that bottle!</center>
<center>And in the Supreme Court! What a terrible blunder!</center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
Officer! What are you waiting for?! Collect up as much of the water from that broken bottle as possible! At once!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
You're wasting your time. This delightful carpet under my feet here was a gift from the British Empire. I assure you, it will soak up the water beautifully. You have neither the technology nor the presence of mind to recover it. Ah ha ha ha hah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How could you?! You... You won't get away with this!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
You can thump the bench and shout as much as you like, little boy. But I'm afraid we'll never know now, will we? If there really was poison in the bottle...or not.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You...
</p><p>Brett:<br />
And let us not forget... ...we still have some very compelling evidence left intact. Isn't that right, Counsel for the Prosecution?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Oh, of course, of course! You're referring to this photographic print, I presume, dear lady?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
That's right. And really, looking at this photograph, it's as clear as day, isn't it? The poor professor was sitting with his back to me. So of course the only person who could have shot him from the front...is the little schoolboy.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
No! You killed the victim that day. Using curare. And then, in order to frame Ryunosuke Naruhodo for the crime... ...you waited until he picked up the pistol you'd arranged for him to find on the floor... ...before you shot the professor's dead body in the chest with your own hidden gun! Then, in the confusion that followed, all you had to do was turn the dead professor and his chair around. You see? You had every opportunity to commit this crime!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Heh...heh...heh... What a wonderful imagination you have, young man.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
A hidden gun, you say? And I shot the professor's dead body, did I? Well, I'm terribly sorry, but...you don't have a shred of evidence.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Exactly! And as you have nothing to support your wild claims, the prosecution's stance remains unchanged. The victim, Dr John H. Wilson, was killed by a gunshot to the chest... ...delivered in cold blood by the accused, Ryunosuke Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is unbelievable! How can this be happening?! We had her! But now... Is she really going to get away with it? The way she <span style="color:#E16935">destroyed that evidence</span> was obscene!)</span>

Ryunosuke!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
We've come this far, but now... Now you're the only one who can finish it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? What do you mean?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
We've lost a vital piece of evidence, it's true. So if there are any clues left for us to use now... ...they must be <span style="color:#E16935">in your head</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(In...my head?)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You told me before that your <span style="color:#E16935">powers of observation</span> were the one thing you could really depend upon.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well yes, that's true, but... <span style="color:#0070C0">(But I didn't manage to notice that this woman was a foreigner with a swan on her head...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So think back again now. Try to remember every last detail about <span style="color:#E16935">the scene</span> that day. Everything you saw. Everything you felt. Every <span style="color:#E16935">colour</span>, every <span style="color:#E16935">smell</span>...

</p><p>Brett:<br />
Where are you going with this, little boy?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's just <span style="color:#E16935">a memory</span> that's been troubling me.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
What memory?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I saw the crime shown in this photographic print with my own eyes that day. And I saw that on the wooden base of the plate that the steak was served on... ...was a spattering of <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span>.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
......... Oh really? And what of it? Obviously that must have happened when you shot the professor.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, that can't be the case.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Take a good look at the photograph, and the relative position of everything there. The plate of steak is almost <span style="color:#E16935">directly behind</span> the victim. If I'm supposed to have shot Dr Wilson in the chest <span style="color:#E16935">from the front</span>... ...there's no way that blood from the victim could have ended up <span style="color:#E16935">directly behind</span> him!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Hm, yes... For blood to have made it onto the plate, it implies the plate was between the victim and the shooter. Which means the shooter must have been <span style="color:#E16935">sitting opposite</span> the professor, as you were... ...Jezaille Brett!

This emblem on the side of the plate... Is it a cat?

It's a cow. Obviously. Most likely because the restaurant's signature dish is beef steak. It seems a lot of different restaurants have their own unique tableware.

So this is the symbol of La Carneval, is it?

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah, yes, that's right. The secret undercover operation.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
La Carneval is a high-class Western cuisine restaurant. It attracts wealthy diners, including many foreigners. Recently, there's been a run of similarly executed <span style="color:#E16935">thefts</span> targeting the restaurant's rich clientele. A number of such incidents have been reported to the police bureau.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... Wicked crimes indeed.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
We wanted to nip the case in the bud quickly. Especially with so many foreigners being affected.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So that's why you were sent in undercover, is it?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes. I took on the job of waiter at the restaurant in order to flush out <span style="color:#E16935">the criminal</span>. It seems likely...that this koban incident is the work of the same thief.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Hm, so unbeknownst to us, there was a master thief at work in the restaurant on a regular basis. The place was already the scene of several crimes, it seems.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't know about the master thief part, but... <span style="color:#E16935">The identity</span> of the person who stole and hid Korekuta-san's koban is all too clear.

Do any of you know... ...of the extraordinarily low wages the Nippon Imperial Army pays those it expects to keep our country safe?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I understand that the temporary increase in taxation owing to the recently ended conflicts remains in place. And I have heard it's hard for lower ranking soldiers to make a living, yes.
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
All I want...is to put a hot meal on the table for my son!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's why you were stealing things at the restaurant?
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
The place is heaving with money! Every three days, I'd go there and do reconnaissance for a target. And I'd enjoy chomping my way through a good steak at the same time!

Yes, when the professor was shot.

I knew that if the police conducted a search and found the coin in my pocket, I'd be finished. Aido, too. So I hid the incriminating evidence as fast as I could. On the double! I slipped it under the steak...hoping that I'd be able to rendezvous with it again at a later date.

Hm, indeed... The theft of the koban was clearly perpetrated by this... 'baby-saddled' sergeant. It would certainly appear to be unrelated to Dr Wilson's <span style="color:#E16935">murder</span>.

Of course it is. Hiding a coin under a lump of meat? The sheer nonsense of such an idea astounds me.

This is absurd! The trial has run several hours already! And you say there's evidence yet to be brought forward? There can't be! I don't believe you have it!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't! But there is someone who <span style="color:#E16935">does have it</span>! Someone in this very courtroom!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And if that person is willing to submit the piece of evidence I'm referring to... ...it will <span style="color:#E16935">solve</span> every remaining mystery about this case!

Very well... I have a feeling this will be my last request of the defence in this trial. <span style="color:green">Who possesses the conclusive evidence that will reveal the truth about this whole affair?</span>

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Counsel... I'm disappointed. As this is likely your last chance, I would have expected you to be taking it more seriously.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It seems you need some waking up. Perhaps a penalty will help focus your mind!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Now we've come this far, there's nothing more to say. There's one person in particular who's provided us with various pieces of evidence already. You have plenty of clues that point to the right answer.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
This is the last act in this trial. And you have centre stage, Ryunosuke!

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The answer is obvious! It's Inspector Hosonaga!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
What?! I, I have it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
You, you think I've been <span style="color:#E16935">withholding</span> conclusive evidence? That's ridicul- Ahem! Ahem! Ahem, AHEM!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No no no no! I'm not saying that! Everyone's attention has been focused on this steak with <span style="color:#E16935">the teeth marks</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Now, earlier this afternoon, Sergeant Nosa told the court the following: 'I'd enjoy chomping my way through a good steak.' And as well as admitting to stealing Korekuta-san's coin, he told us that he 'slipped it under the steak.'
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
You, you watch it, cadet! I'm a superior officer!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sergeant Nosa, could you please confirm something for me? Was the steak that you put the coin under... in fact, your own steak?
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
Teeen-shun! Affirmative, of course! I might be a soldier in the Imperial Nippon Army, but still... ...I'm not brave enough to ask a foreign gentlelady if she'd mind me manhandling her meal to hide something in it!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In other words, the steak that the detective submitted as evidence earlier... ...was in fact Sergeant Nosa's meal.

</p><p>Auchi:<br />
But...that makes no sense! That plate was taken from the victim's table.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yet the gentlewoman doesn't take bites out of her steak, nor did she have any opportunity to steal the coin.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Of course I didn't steal it! To even suggest such a thing would be...an affront to the entire British Empire!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well then...how do you explain this paradox?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Exactly! Surely you're not going to suggest... ...that the sergeant <span style="color:#E16935">switched</span> the two steaks over?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
.........
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
......... You DID <span style="color:#E16935">switch</span> the plates?
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
......... Well...after it happened... The, um...
</p>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<p>Nosa:<br />
When I saw the civilian had been murdered right in front of my eyes like that, I panicked. As I said, I immediately lifted my steak and hid the coin underneath it. But then when the waiter announced he was an undercover policeman, I thought I'd had it! If he decided to investigate my slab of meat, that'd be it. I'd be getting my marching orders! So when the cadet here was arrested and taken off to the kitchen, I seized my chance. With military precision and timing...I switched my steak with the one on the foreign lady's table!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
What?! You can't have! I, I never saw you do such a thing!
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
It was called 'Operation Lightning Bolt'. There was no time for strategic planning. It was do or die, I tell you! So yes! I did what had to be done!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Un... Unbelievableeeeeeeee!
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
However! Fear not, Prosecutor-san!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
What now?
</p><p>Nosa:<br />
I swear on the brass buttons of my uniform... that is all I did! Sir!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
'All you did'?! That's plenty, Sergeant!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest?cb=20210618204245" class="image"><img alt="Yes Ryunosuke" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="146" data-image-name="Yes Ryunosuke.png" data-image-key="Yes_Ryunosuke.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210618204245" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So, if Sergeant Nosa switched the plates over... ...it means he took Miss Brett's steak - and the plate it was on - back to <span style="color:#E16935">his own table</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, that follows.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Inspector Hosonaga!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Earlier in this trial, you told the court this: You said that you had not only taken Miss Brett's steak after the incident, but also the sergeant's. That to preserve evidence, you had taken <span style="color:#E16935">both</span>.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
...!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
That's correct.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then please present it to the court now. The plate that was actually on the victim's table at the precise moment he was shot!
</p><p>Brett:<br />

</p><p>Brett:<br />
What can that possibly tell us now? I mean, a cold slab of tough meat? It can't have the slightest bearing on the case!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
No! You're not wriggling your way out of it this time, lady!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
I, I beg your pardon...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Surely you're not that forgetful. Surely you remember <span style="color:#E16935">the reason</span> why this steak pan promises to prove such a problem for you...no?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Hmph! You're the ones who decided it was a problem, not me.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">The reason</span> the defence asked to see that plate was to confirm something the defendant remembers seeing.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Tsk! THINKS he remembers!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm quite sure of <span style="color:#E16935">what I saw</span>, Miss Brett. On the side of the plate that was on the table directly behind Dr Wilson... ...there was a clear spattering of <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span> from the gunshot wound to the victim's chest. 
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I believe the defendant's memory serves him well.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And now we have the evidence to prove it! The plate you were eating from, Miss Brett!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Let us not prolong this any further. Inspector, you will show the evidence to the court. Present the beef steak and plate that was originally on the victim's table at the time of the incident!
</p>
<center>Yes, siiir!</center>
<hr />
<p>Hosonaga:<br />
Sorry for keeping you. Here is the other steak and its plate. Please, feel free to examine it.
</p>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">The bloodstain</span>... It's clearly visible, look!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest?cb=20210618204245" class="image"><img alt="Yes Ryunosuke" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="146" data-image-name="Yes Ryunosuke.png" data-image-key="Yes_Ryunosuke.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3c/Yes_Ryunosuke.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210618204245" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Now this makes everything clear. <span style="color:#E16935">The blood</span> you can see on the side of the plate... ...shows that at the moment the victim was shot, he was facing the table, <span style="color:#E16935">with his back to me</span>.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
In other words! It's <span style="color:#E16935">impossible</span> for Naruhodo-san to have shot the victim!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
It, it can't be...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In fact, there's only one person who could possibly have shot Dr Wilson from <span style="color:#E16935">the front</span>. I'm sure everyone knows by now who that person is.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
...Ugh...um...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right... <span style="color:#E16935">Miss Jezaille Brett</span>... It's you!
</p><p>Brett:<br />
......... Outdone...by a Japanese? Me? By a Japanese schoolboy? No... No... NO...<br />
</p>
<center>KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br /> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br /> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br /> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH</center>
<hr />
<p>Brett:<br />
Please excuse my...little outburst. I briefly lost my composure. Most unbecoming behaviour for an English gentlewoman. Forgive me.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, Miss Brett... ...I think it's time you told the court what actually happened that day. The truth, this time.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
......... Gladly, Your Excellency.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Brett:<br />
...It was I who took the professor's life, using curare. As you surmised, I chose that particular day for one very important reason... The professor had a dental appointment for the extraction of one of his teeth in the morning.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So you planned to kill the professor, knowing that no trace of poison would be found in his water. Because curare is unheard of here in Japan.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Yes. Of course, I never intended to remain at the restaurant for as long as I did. I only needed to see the professor take one tiny sip of his water, and it would be all over. I would place the steak I had ordered in front of him to make it appear as though he had been dining alone... ...and leave immediately. However... ...before any of that happened, there was an unexpected visitor at the professor's table.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That would be me...I suppose?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Yes, you. Who else? Such a trifling matter. But the fact that you'd decided to come over to greet the professor... ...meant that I had lost my chance to slip away unnoticed. In due course, the professor took a sip of his water and was paralysed. I made sure he was sitting in his chair such that he wouldn't fall.<br />
</p>
<center>There was no going back at that point. So I concocted <span style="color:#E16935">a plan</span> on the spur of the moment.</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:<br />
A plan to pin Dr Wilson's murder on this innocent man.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
......... I happened to know that the professor always carried a gun. I decided to use that fact to my advantage. I had the bottle of curare in my handbag. And...my own <span style="color:#E16935">pistol</span> concealed under my skirt.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
U-Under you <i>[sic]</i> skirt...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So I was right. There were two guns.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
...<i>Yes</i>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And then I finished my coffee and got up to leave. That's when I noticed the professor's gun, which you had presumably placed on the floor. Placed where you were sure that I would notice it.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
And everything went according to plan. You noticed the gun, as I'd intended. And then, just as you bent down to pick it up...
</p>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's when you shot the professor with your own gun. Even though at that point, he was already dead.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Naturally, the gunshot caused a commotion, at which point the waiter appeared.
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Obviously, I assumed Naruhodo-san was the culprit and apprehended him. I took him to the pantry that adjoins the kitchen and locked him inside.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
That's when I took the opportunity to turn the professor and his chair around.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Because, of course... ...you needed to make it look like the defendant had shot Dr Wilson from where he'd picked up the gun.
</p>
<center>.........</center>
<p><br />
Brett:<br />
...So there you have it. That is the entirety of my...misdemeanour.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Your Excellency...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Brett:<br />
I wonder... ...might I speak with you in private later?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I shall call on you.
</p><p>Brett:<br />
Thank you. Good day then, everyone. I hope you can forgive me...Naruhodo-san.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It would seem... ...this trial has finally run its course. I presume the prosecution is in agreement?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
This, this can't be... Taketsuchi Auchi does not lose! Not to the likes of this, this...ROOKIE STUDENT!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You'd better start getting used to tough opposition.
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
ARRRRRRGH! Ryunosuke Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha- Yes?
</p><p>Auchi:<br />
This insult to the Auchi family name... will NEVER be forgotten!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You've become conceited with age, Counsel. But the old have to stand aside and make way for the new. It's the way of the world. ...May you never forget that! A thousand millenia may pass, and still the Auchi clan will never measure up to the Naruhodo clan!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
This trial, in the Supreme Court of Japan... ...will, I believe, go down in history as the start of a new chapter in our country's judicial system. Despite being summoned as the accused, you, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, presented an excellent case.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I... Thank you, Your Excellency!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The use of evidence and deduction to unravel the truth is a modern methodology. After all, it has only been a few short decades since our country opened its doors to the wider world. But the Western ideas of '<span style="color:#E16935">science</span>' are rapidly gaining acceptance here. I feel sure that science will soon bring new methods of investigation, and new procedures of justice. A new future of law awaits. But what it will look like, I cannot begin to imagine. That is for the young to pursue. Kazuma Asogi...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
After this trial, you are set to embark on a journey of discovery, to the illustrious British Empire. Learn all you can. Absorb everything of the wider world that you are able to. And do not forget...to fulfil <span style="color:#E16935">the mission</span> imposed upon you.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... I understand...Your Excellency.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What was that about? Why do you look so grave all of a sudden?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ah... Never mind.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
As for you, Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Yes?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In you, I sense - how can I put it? - unusual potential. I very much look forward to seeing how you carry that onwards.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Thank you, Your Excellency!
</p>

<p>Judge:<br />
It is time to deliver the final verdict. I hereby find the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo...

Well, I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you, Kazuma.

Ha ha ha ha hah! No no, it was a pleasure to watch you at work. So, you owe me an extra large sukiyaki from the place on Yumei University Street. Don't forget!

Good afternoon. All your hard work has certainly paid off.

Congratulations to both of you for proving Naruhodo-san's innocence.

Thank you so much! If we hadn't had that research paper of Miss Brett's, I don't know how things would have turned out.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Your kind words should really be for my father. I was simply doing as he asked. It was his idea for me to go to the university and investigate.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Your father...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Ah yes, of course...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>???:<br />
Forgive me for intruding on court proceedings, Your Excellency.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Susato Mikotoba</span>, judicial assistant to the defence.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Speaking of <span style="color:#E16935">Mikotoba</span>...)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
Ah, there you are. I believe congratulations are in order!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Naruhodo... You did an excellent job.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Th-Thank you, Professor.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Oh no, it is I who should be thanking you. After all... ...your efforts exposed the true criminal that took the life of my good friend.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">('<span style="color:#E16935">Good friend</span>'?)</span> Oh yes, you mentioned that before. It was you who actually invited Dr Wilson to Yumei University, wasn't it?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Yes, that's right.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Professor Mikotoba studied overseas himself. He went to study forensic medicine in Great Britain. Presumably that's when you met Dr Wilson?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Exactly. In those days, we worked together in the same hospital.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, you worked together?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I've never heard you mention that before.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well, it was a long time ago now. Besides... ...it's your turn, Asogi.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Great Britain is a magnificent country. It leads the world. In science, medicine, engineering, culture... And, of course, in law. Watch and learn, my boy. See what's happening in the world's largest melting pot!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I will. I'll learn all that I can. I swear on this, <span style="color:#E16935">the spirit</span> of the Asogi clan!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You're not taking that sword to Great Britain, are you?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Of course I am. A Japanese man's katana is his soul. This blade shows me where I need to go. And cuts down anything that's in my way.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, I've definitely seen how sharp it is already with my own eyes...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
That reminds me, what's happened to the woman? To Jezaille Brett, I mean. After all, she's guilty of murder.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Ah yes, her. It's not easy to tell you this, but...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean? Surely she's going to face trial herself now. She's the true culprit, after all.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
She will be leaving Japan in the very near future. For Shanghai.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? Shanghai?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Jezaille Brett will not appear in court again in this country. I'm certain of that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? But why not?
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>It's a matter of <span style="color:#E16935">consular jurisdiction</span>.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Inspector Hosonaga!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
It was a hard-fought battle in the courtroom today. Very impressive to watch. I must congratula-
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but what's all this about <span style="color:#E16935">consular jurisdiction</span>?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
We cannot try this particular foreigner for her crimes here in Japan.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What...? We <span style="color:#E16935">can't try</span> her? But then, who? Who's going to bring her to justice?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
A British consular court will hear her case. Somewhere far away, where our voices can't be heard.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(But why a consular court...?)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Professor, I simply don't understand. I thought consular courts were <span style="color:#E16935">a thing of the past</span> now that we've signed <span style="color:#E16935">the friendship treaty</span>.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Yes, in normal circumstances, you're right.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Then, so long as this is not <span style="color:#E16935">a serious incident</span> of a highly political nature to our respective governments... ...they can't invoke a consular court just like that!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh... Can't they?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes, she's a student, but it doesn't justify our governments making <span style="color:#E16935">secret agreements</span> about her fate, does it? Something strange is going on!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So Miss Brett <span style="color:#E16935">can't be held accountable</span> for her actions here in Japan...)</span>
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I'm afraid that for the young student... ...today's trial was nothing more than <span style="color:#E16935">a game</span> all along. There was never any danger of comeuppance for her.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't believe it...
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
The British government's foreign affairs ministry has demanded that we hand over custody of Miss Brett. They're obviously taking this case of a foreign student committing murder very seriously.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
......... But it's all going to change from now on. We can make it change. This is a time of great turmoil, this new era heralded by the start of the twentieth century. One day, I have no doubt... ...that woman will receive the judgment she deserves.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes, change is coming. And we're the ones driving it.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well, I think that's enough seriousness for now. This evening calls for a celebratory drink!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But Professor...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You're right. This is no time for gloomy faces! We should be celebrating Ryunosuke's not guilty verdict! Let's start having some fun!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
In that case, might I suggest La Carneval? As the head waiter, I should be delighted to provide you with ample food and drink!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...you're a detective, Hosonaga-san. ...Aren't you?
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Ahem! Ahem! Let's not worry about details for now. To La Carneval! Will you accompany us, Professor?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Of course! La Carneval's food is second to none!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I shall go and attend to the paperwork for Naruhodo-san's release.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, yes... Thank you. <span style="color:#0070C0">(So Jezaille Brett won't be tried here. I, I suppose that means I'll never know. I'll never find out why she killed Dr Wilson...)</span> Kazuma...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes, Ryunosuke?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I just wanted to say thanks again, that's all. You really saved my skin today.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ha ha ha ha hah! I didn't do a thing! You were the lawyer in there, weren't you? That defence was all your own work.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Your skills made the difference, though. One day, I bet you'll be the best lawyer in the world.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Hm, I'm not so sure about that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
To be honest, something kept occurring to me over and over again during that trial. I couldn't help thinking that maybe you're the one destined to become a great lawyer, not me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...? Come on, be serious!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
If I helped you today, it was only right at the very start of the trial. But you have a natural talent for it. For being a defence lawyer, I mean.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh no! Not me! All that tense verbal combat? I never want to go through that ever again! I just... I did what you told me to do, that's all. Because I knew I could trust you.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
That's the point.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? What do you mean, '<span style="color:#E16935">that's the point</span>'?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Listen, Ryunosuke... Do you know what the most crucial weapon is that any lawyer needs in order to win?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...knowledge of the law?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
No. The ability to <span style="color:#E16935">believe</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
To believe? To believe what?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
A defence lawyer has to fight for his clients. He has to believe in them at all times.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Like you believed in me when I said I didn't do it.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I'm human, just like you. I don't have some superhuman ability to know the truth. But you have to make a choice about what to believe in and stick to it when you're defending someone. Sometimes in the courtroom, you can really be backed into a corner. But being able to remain faithful to what you chose to believe in even then... Well, that's not something that anyone can do. It takes a special kind of person.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm, believing in your client...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Just look at today's trial. I'm a student lawyer with precious little real experience, but you never stopped believing in me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, I...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You faced seemingly hopeless situations time and again, but you never stopped looking for the truth. And in the end, you found it. Through your own efforts. And because you never stopped believing in me. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Thanks, Kazuma.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... There's something I want to ask you, actually, Ryunosuke. Well, it's <span style="color:#E16935">a favour</span>, really. Something very important to me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It sounds serious. What is-
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
Ah! You're still here, are you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Inspector Hosonaga!
</p><p>Hosonaga:<br />
I've arranged some rickshaws for us. Let's go!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Thank you. We'll be right there. Let's pick up this conversation again later. We should be celebrating right now. Your first court victory!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And YOUR study tour to Great Britain, don't forget!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ah yes. That too.
</p>
<hr />
<center>So my very first trial came to an end. Kazuma... Professor Mikotoba... Susato-san, who acted as my assistant... Inspector Hosonaga...who didn't really play much of a part, but still... It was because of the help and support of all these people that I managed to get through that trial. But more importantly... Kazuma hadn't yet managed to ask his <span style="color:#E16935">favour</span> of me. Little did I realise... ...just how much it would change my life.</center>
