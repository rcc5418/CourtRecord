I'm right in thinking that these scales are a symbol of the defence in law, aren't they?

They're supposed to symbolise treating everything equally...and fairly. That's why they're always in the middle, balanced. Equal measures on both sides.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Recently though, whenever I see a set of scales, I can only think of the enormous Scales of Justice.

That's entirely understandable. They are such a powerful symbol in the courtroom, aren't they?

And the thing about the Scales of Justice is... ...they're always leaning one way or the other. They're only ever in balance right at the start.

Oh, this room! It's been too long! It hasn't changed in the slightest, though. And it's been some six months, hasn't it? ...That's a long time for things to stay so...familiar.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I didn't know when you might return, and I wanted everything to be as you'd left it. ...But it has been some six months, it's true.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So is your father alright, Susie? What happened?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
My father?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! Professor Mikotoba! I mean, it was half a year ago, but that's why you went back to Japan! Because of the telegram you received saying he'd fallen ill with a very high fever for some unknown reason.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
That's right. So I was surprised to learn you'd be coming back so soon. Surprised but happy!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... I think I wrote about it in my letter to you. That it was all a trick. My father is in fine health. And I'm obviously very relieved...about that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, we're all delighted to have you back.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It was quite by accident that I've been able to return to Europe, actually. It's because of a very grand conference called the International Forensic Science Symposium.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The International Forensic... <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's the same symposium Lord Stronghart mentioned.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Anyway, I've arrived safe and sound, and all that matters is that I'm here now! After all, I haven't yet fulfilled my promise to you, Iris.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You must tell us everything that happened while you were back in Japan.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, of course, I shall.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And...there's one other thing... Something you wrote in your letter that particularly grabbed my attention. About...you-know-who. <span style="color:#0070C0">(About Kazuma...)</span>

It must be about a year ago now. I wrote a really long story based on some of my father's old notes. It's about one of Hurley's greatest exploits. I called it 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...But then Mr Sholmes forbade you from publishing it... ...and put the manuscript somewhere nobody could get their hands on it.

So nobody knows anything about it, apart from Hurley and I. But for some reason... ...you knew the title of it, didn't you, Susie?

Oh, it sounds so exciting! 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'! I should love to read it!

It was completely by accident that I came to know the title of your manuscript, Iris. It was a short while before we left Japan. I was cleaning Father's study, and I saw something on his writing desk. A large box of papers. There was a label affixed to the box that was written in English. It read... ...'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
My Baskerville story?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Of course, I had no idea what it was at the time. But Father came in, and...

</p>
<center>Oh! F-Father...</center>
<p><br />

</p>

</p>
<center>Sorry?</center>

</p>
<center>Forget that you ever saw it, and certainly don't tell anybody else about this. ...Do you understand?</center>

<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...what was Iris's manuscript doing...in Japan?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I have no idea. But when I heard Iris mention the word 'Baskerville' that day... ...the title just slipped out. I would never have guessed... ...that it was an unpublished account of one of Mr Sholmes's exploits.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
When I returned to Japan, I asked Father to explain. But he refused to answer any of my questions. And there was no sign of the big box in his office.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's really all I know about it. I've no doubt that Father has a very good reason for being so secretive about it. But still... ...I made up my mind to explain myself to both of you.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
......... Well, thank you for being so honest, Susie.

Ooh, you dressed as a man then, didn't you, Susie?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! Well...yes...since women are forbidden in the courtroom. I had no choice.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Wow! Amazing! I wish I'd seen it! Don't you, Runo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...yes, I...suppose so.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I want to play at being a lawyer now! I could wear a false moustache, maybe!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I don't think any moustache could hide the fact that you're just <span style="color:#E16935">ten years old</span>, Iris. There's something else I've been wanting to ask you, Miss Susato... It's about the real reason why Professor Mikotoba summoned you back to Japan. You said in your letter it was something to do with that convict's <span style="color:#E16935">loot</span> we found in Mr Natsume's lodgings...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's right. The very large dog collar we found with the 'B' emblem on it. It seems Mr Natsume included a drawing of the collar in the report he submitted about his time in Britain. I understand that when Father saw the report, he turned as white as a sheet.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why would that be, then?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Father came to Britain himself, of course. To study. It was some time ago now, but he stayed for six years. I can only imagine that something must have happened during that time. But if he refuses to tell me what it was, then I intend to find the answers for myself. And I've decided that I, for one, won't keep any more secrets.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh! Susie...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's a very meaningful look Susato-san's giving Iris there...)</span>

Lord Stronghart mentioned something about that symposium, too. I think he said that investigative authorities from forty different countries would attend.

Yes, and from Japan, my father and Judge Jigoku have been invited. It's something of an honour, I believe.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, Professor Mikotoba is the leading expert in forensic medicine in our country, after all. But...who's the other person you mentioned? A judge, did you say?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. His Excellency, Judge Seishiro Jigoku. You've met him, Mr Naruhodo. Last year...in the Supreme Court... You can't possibly have forgotten! That terrible trial of yours, when you were accused of murder.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Aaah... Yes, I...try to think of that as a positive turning point in my life these days...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, it was Judge Jigoku who presided over that trial.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...If I'm perfectly honest, I'd be happy never to see that man's face again in my life.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, well anyway...as Father was invited to the symposium, he agreed to me returning to Britain, too. He won't actually arrive until next month, but... Well, I couldn't wait! So I pleaded with him, and in the end he agreed to me going on ahead!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, about the symposium... It seems as though Lord Stronghart has put in an awful lot of work to make it happen. It's obviously very important.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I believe it is, yes. As I understand it, Lord Stronghart organised the entire event himself. I think...he's hoping that by achieving exceptional results, he'll get the job of Attorney General.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The most senior position in the British justice system...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
He's hoping to use his power to create the world's finest policing institution. That's what Father said anyway! Apparently it's Lord Stronghart's lifelong ambition!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Does Professor Mikotoba know Lord Stronghart personally then, I wonder...?)</span> Actually, Lord Stronghart gave me a long speech all about this very subject only yesterday. But I sort of lost the will to live early on and didn't really listen to much of it.

Since the incident, our government's intelligence services have been investigating Miss Brett. But it turns out that an Englishwoman by the name of Jezaille Brett <span style="color:#E16935">didn't actually exist</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
D-Didn't exist? But...how can that be?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It was a pseudonym. Her real name was Shinn. And she wasn't a visiting student, either. That was a front.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A front? Who, who on earth was she, then?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Miss A. Shinn. Her name is literally all our intelligence services have been able to ascertain about her. Nobody knows why, or even how, she came to be in Japan. It's a complete mystery.

But, but that makes no sense! It's no easy task to be accepted as a foreign student anywhere! What could the woman have been up to?!

My name is Susato Mikotoba. I'm Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant. It's a pleasure to meet you, Professor.

I owe you an apology too, Professor. I didn't manage to deliver what I promised you I would in court this morning.

Oh no! No no no! No no no no no! The whole thing... The whole miserable affair... It all happened because I've been such a complete and utter clot!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Is it some new hypothesis? Something to surpass super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis, maybe?
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Ah...no, actually. This...is my autobiography.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Your autobiography?
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
'How I was Diddled and Fiddled'...by Albert Harebrayne! I've found I can represent my <span style="color:#E16935">odd</span> fortunes with only <span style="color:#E16935">odd</span> numbers in an ambitious set of simultaneous <span style="color:#E16935">equations</span>!

</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
I'm going to have to pay back all the loans I took for the kinesis machine, you see! So it's going to be a new serial publication from next month! 'Part 1: An Odd Birth; an Odd Upbringing'.

Oh, Professor...
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
He believed in me this morning, you know. Barok did. He believed in my hypothesis.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, I think... ...that was just a necessary factor in the prosecution establishing its case.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
No no, Barok wouldn't do something like that. I'm sure he genuinely believed it.

Do, do you think he set out to trick me from the very start?

I'm sorry to say...that does seem likely, yes.

......... When I first met him, he introduced himself as a wealthy financier. He looked over the paper I'd written and said my work would benefit all humanity and MUST be pursued! He was so enthused! He was so emphatic!

But in reality...he was the mastermind of some vast criminal network, it seems.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
I, I still can't believe it...

As the machine was essentially a set decoration for some stage magic... ...it probably didn't require a large amount of investment, actually.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But the scale of it! It wasn't just some small trick. It was a very elaborate feat of deception.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
All young scientists are full of hope about their burgeoning ideas. Full of zeal. But none of us have any money! We want to do research, but we can't afford it! Many of us take on barely legal part-time work to try to earn just a few measly pennies to carry on! To go through all of that, only to be taken for a complete fool! It's too rotten to believe...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It is, I agree. And that's why we have to find those responsible and bring them to justice. Mr Asman is no more, of course. Which leaves only the engineer...

</p><p>Susato:<br />
I wonder... I've never seen her before.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Ah, the young champion of the court. You had some success this morning, I understand. And you've thrown the entire government into disarray as a result.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! You, you mean because of Professor Harebrayne's experiment?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Sham science being demonstrated at London's Great Exhibition! The country's been made to look foolish, and now politicians are scrabbling to respond. Lord van Zieks is in Whitehall as we speak, giving an emergency briefing.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh dear, I, um... I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
None of this is your responsibility. The government is entirely to blame for having been taken in. The special dispensation that prevents investigation at the scene will be annulled later today. Once that happens, my Forensic Investigation Team will move in and deal with that scrap metal in no time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's scrap metal now, is it?)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
Until later then, Lord Stronghart.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Yes. Thank you.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...who was that?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
That was Dr Courtney Sithe, Scotland Yard's esteemed chief coroner. She's leading the Forensic Investigation Team's handling of this case. She was just delivering her report about the victim, in fact.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, I see... <span style="color:#0070C0">(About Mr Asman.)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Following the outcome of the trial earlier, I asked the coroner's office to re-evaluate its findings. I don't have time to tell you what she concluded. If you want to know, you'll have to ask her directly. You can find her in <span style="color:#E16935">the forensics laboratory</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, right.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Now, what were you here to see me about? I can give you...seven minutes and thirty-nine seconds of my time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So he's not running quite so spectacularly late any more...)</span>

What exactly is the Forensic Investigation Team that you mentioned before?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The British Empire's police force must become the most exemplary in the world. For that to happen, it's imperative that we embrace forensic science and everything it has to offer. I first created the Forensic Investigation Team a year ago now - unofficially of course - to pave the way.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Goodness! A year ago?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
At next month's symposium, I intend to present the results of their work to the world. Once I do that, the House of Lords will be powerless to oppose the creation of a full-scale forensics division. And once that happens, the position of Attorney General will be mine...and criminals will suffer dearly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
For too long, those scoundrels have made a mockery of our legal system with false evidence and bribes. But London's scum is about to be rounded up and burnt in the fires of Hell. I intend to see to it personally. By creating the finest police force the world has ever known! To protect our honour...and our future!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Look at those eyes... He means every word.)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Doctor Sithe is an extremely reliable coroner. When I officially establish the forensics division at Scotland Yard... ...she will run it as my right-hand woman. Now then...speaking of the symposium, Miss Mikotoba...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! Yes, My Lord?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Your father should be on the high seas as we speak, making his way here to represent the Empire of Japan.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, that's right. I understand he will arrive at the beginning of next month.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Are you acquainted, Lord Stronghart? With Professor Mikotoba, I mean.

If my memory serves, it was some fifteen years ago now that your father came to Britain as a visiting student.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It was the year I was born. So yes, sixteen years ago in fact.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Mikotoba was a young practitioner of forensic science. And Jigoku accompanied him as a young, promising judge. The punctiliousness and politeness of the Japanese at the time impressed us greatly. ......... Not that I wish to imply impoliteness or carelessness on your part in any way.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I didn't think that you were.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Dr Mikotoba studied forensics at one of London's large hospitals. <span style="color:#E16935">St Synner's</span>, if I'm not mistaken. Dr Sithe was also there then, as it happens.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Then, Dr Sithe knows my father, does she?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
She was a young medical assistant at the time, so I doubt their paths crossed regularly. But I've no doubt they knew each other superficially. After all, Dr Mikotoba was here studying his subject for some six years in total.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Six years... That's a long time to be studying abroad, isn't it?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I lived with my grandmother in those years.

I wanted to ask you about Lord van Zieks, actually. I heard that his older brother was killed some years ago. By a mass murderer known as the Professor, who targeted nobles and royalty. Is that right?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...You Japanese are a thorough lot. You've done your research well. Yes... ...and you could say it was that very incident...that gave rise to the Reaper.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? Why?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
When his brother, Klint van Zieks, was murdered... ...it was just after young Barok had graduated from the University of London and become a prosecutor. When obvious criminals who managed to evade conviction in court started 'disappearing'... ...rumours quickly spread throughout the capital. Londoners started to say that wherever Barok van Zieks went, the ghost of his dead brother wasn't far behind.

So you thought you'd snoop around? That's acceptable to you people from the East, is it? Well? What do you want?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, um... Lord Stronghart told us, you see... ...that it was you who examined the victim's body. Erm, Mr Asman's body, I mean.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So we came to ask you about your findings. On Lord Stronghart's advice.
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
......... Very well. If the Lord Chief Justice has given his consent, I'll tell you what our investigation revealed. But when we're done, you must leave immediately.

So, you want to know what the Forensic Investigation Team determined from its examination of the scene? The victim, Mr Odie Asman, who disappeared from the experimentation stage amid an explosion... ...and the Mr Asman who appeared moments later part-way up the Crystal Tower... ...were without question <span style="color:#E16935">one and the same person</span>. That is the team's conclusion.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...but that can't be right!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
If it was an elaborate trick, we can only speculate about how it was carried out.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Let's see...if two people who looked very similar to each other were involved... ...they could have made it appear as if one single person had <span style="color:#E16935">switched places</span>, couldn't they?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Very true. But sadly in this instance...that was not the case. The man who disappeared and the man who subsequently reappeared was <span style="color:#E16935">the same person</span>. <span style="color:#E16935">The fingerprints</span> at the scene make that quite evident.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, fingerprints...
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
They're not yet officially recognised as forensic evidence in the British justice system. But one day...they will be used as an investigative aid as a matter of course.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my! But that would mean... ...that the instantaneous kinesis actually took place! So...where does that leave us?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
......... My team was tasked with investigating. Not drawing conclusions.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Instantaneous kinesis is impossible...and yet the body did move from one place to the other. This hasn't cleared anything up at all. It's made the whole thing even more of a mystery!)</span>

Susato:<br />
I had no idea there were so many people in the world.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I know what you mean. It's really packed here today.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It feels as though it's taken us two hours just to make our way through the crowds to this point.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Has it? I shut my brain down so I didn't really notice, to be honest.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Gosh...I do wish I had your absence of mind sometimes, Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>???:<br />
...There you are. I had a feelin' you lot would show your mugs before long.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Inspector Gregson! I see you're hard at work as usual!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Warm greetings to you. I do hope you've been keepin' well since last we met.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's with all the ceremony? We just saw each other in court this morning.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Not you, sunshine. The gentlewoman so loyally at your side.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! Why, thank you, Inspector. How good of you to notice.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He might be a bit rough around the edges, but he's still a proper English gentleman at heart...I suppose.)</span> As you've probably guessed, we were hoping to investigate the scene some more.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Right. Well, that's the young trainee's domain. Oi! Get over here, Gina!
</p><p>.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...She seems to be busy playing with a puppy. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Probably giving it a traditional 'East End' training...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
G-Gina?! She's a police officer now?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Amazing, isn't it?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
She's a good kid, actually. Heart's in the right place, anyway. She's got the detection bug, if you ask me. Yup, I think she'll follow in my footsteps nicely.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...What do you mean?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I'm bein' transferred. It's time for me to say toodle-oo to London.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh no! Really?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's, that's a bit sudden, isn't it? I had no idea. Where are you going to be posted, then? We'll come to see how you're getting along.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Haha, not likely. But you're welcome to try. If you don't mind a trip to France, that is.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
To France?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I'll be workin' in the Paris Police Prefecture. ...Should be right up my alley.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but France! It's an entirely different country! I don't understand. Why would you be sent there?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That's the way the adult world works, sunshine! Now, don't go pokin' your nose in where it's not wanted. ......... I'm intendin' to take the kid with me when I go.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? You're taking Gina to Paris?!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Well I can't leave her here in London. Who knows what'd become of her.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...I suppose he's worried she'd slip back into slipping her hands into people's pockets and purses...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I don't think he's worried about her pickpocketing, Mr Naruhodo. I think he's worried about the Reaper.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Of course! So that's playing on Inspector Gregson's mind too, is it?)</span>
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Anyway, I haven't mentioned any o' this to Gina. So don't go blabbin', you hear me?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
N-No, of course not.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I've gotta keep that divin' diva safe an' sound. ...Until all this is over, at least.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Oi! Did you just call me a bloomin' 'divin' diva' again?!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
So you heard that, did ya? Right, well... Any questions about the scene, you can put 'em to my capable detective diva here.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Alright, you 'eard the boss! Inspector Lestrade's in charge 'ere now!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...I suppose I'd better keep my word and not mention anything about Paris.)</span> So, um, Gina... You've got a new dog, have you?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Isn't 'e great? Toby's 'is name.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, how delightful! He's absolutely adorable!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

What a shame that the symbolic landmark of the Great Exhibition has been damaged like that.

Yes, unfortunately the birdcage crashed in the most prominent position possible. It's the gods giving us a warning, if you ask me: 'Man must travel under his own steam, and not cut corners with instantaneous kinesis.'
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But imagine what might have happened if the birdcage had landed in a slightly different location. The death toll could have been far worse. So I think perhaps it was a blessing in disguise.

I have a fairly good sense of smell myself, as it happens. I can tell undergarments that have been freshly laundered from undergarments that...haven't.

Yes, of course. ...It is amazing, though, isn't it? The scale of the whole affair is so very British.

It does make you feel a bit like an explorer, doesn't it? I know it's all subjective, but the onion-shaped roofs have rather caught my attention, personally.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...It IS very subjective, isn't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Japanese buildings, with their wood and paper construction, have excellent ventilation. And I've realised that British buildings, being made from brick and stone, are very strong and long-lasting. The more you know about how things are done in other countries, the more you understand your own, I feel.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh yes, I do agree with you there!

My most humble apologies...

I thought I'd died and gone to eternal paradise for a moment...via London.

My dear madam...allow me to make amends by offering you a tasty free deduction at some point.

...As long as it's not of questionable street food quality.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I don't understand. Why are you working as a waxwork here, Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Merely a secret identity, you understand. Though the case is largely solved now.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Largely solved?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We're talking about the waxwork abduction, I presume?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed we are, my good fellow. As I predicted, it was as easy as proverbial pie. Though I confess...I'm yet to partake of a pie, proverbial or otherwise. Or any food so far today for that matter.

Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That stomach rumble echoed around the whole museum...)</span> So how did you manage to solve it so quickly?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, well, do remember I said it was largely solved. Anyway, I simply negotiated with the culprit. Are you familiar with the so-called 'telephone'?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh yes! It's a most modern invention, allowing you to hold a conversation with people far away. In Japan, only the imperial capital and a handful of other cities are connected as yet.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
This morning, a telephone call was received here from the perpetrator of the abduction. As such, I was able to negotiate terms, and in the end, the waxwork was returned.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's amazing!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Just between you and I... ...it would appear the culprit had always intended to return the stolen waxwork in any event.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! But...I thought whoever was responsible had demanded a ransom, no?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes. I think perhaps... ...the ransom demand was necessary to avoid unwanted suspicion regarding the true motive.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But...does that not mean... ...your negotiating was entirely unnecessary?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... A fact that I must ask you to keep from Madame Tusspells at all costs! A hungry young Iris awaits my return to Baker Street, after all.

Indeed. And wherein lies the problem?

We met him earlier today. The 'victim', Kazuma Asogi.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... You're quite sure?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
He...was wearing some sort of mask, and was apparently suffering from amnesia. But yes, I'm quite sure. It was Kazuma-sama.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You must have known at the time, Mr Sholmes. That he...wasn't actually dead.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... Well, I can only assume I was swept up in the murderous atmosphere of the moment. But the fellow wasn't dead at all? Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Priceless! ...I don't suppose that performance would pass muster, would it, Mr Naruhodo?

I could believe that the crewmen present at the time made a mistake. But not you...Mr Sholmes.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Please, Mr Sholmes...

Tomorrow in court, you will find yourself on the threshold of a very great mystery. For now, I'm afraid that is all I can say.

A, a camera! But it's so small! British technology is incredible, isn't it? I mean, what about Mr Sholmes's skin prints?

</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh gosh! An enormous hound? How awful...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
After taking the life of his fifth victim, the killer was apprehended. It was a case of unprecedented magnitude in Britain, you understand. Accordingly... ...the Professor was tried in <span style="color:#E16935">a closed court</span>. No members of the public were permitted.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A closed court? So you mean that the Professor's identity...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As you've surmised, my dear fellow. His identity was never made public. Naturally, he was found guilty, and was summarily sentenced to death by hanging. He was buried in a grave at Lowgate Cemetery, which adjoins the rear of the prison where he had been held. However...that was not the end of the affair.

The Professor's acts of terror threw London's upper classes into complete panic ten years ago. It was a great scandal, one might say...at the very highest levels of society. And since the killer's identity was never made public, rumours abounded. After all, no killer had ever before systematically employed a dog as a weapon of murder.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I can imagine the impact the case must have had.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But in time, of course, the rumours abated. So too did talk of the shocking witness account of the convict who came back to life. It was forgotten. Dismissed as a dubious ghost story. As a preposterous parlour tale.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But...but why did people stop believing it?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Why, simply because there was <span style="color:#E16935">no resurrection</span> to speak of. As was established in fact.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What, what do you mean by 'no resurrection'?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The police investigated the grave in Lowgate Cemetery and published their findings. The convict's body was found to be buried exactly where it had been following the execution.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No! But that would mean Mr Drebber... ...must have lied to the police and the newspapers!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...That would appear to be the only logical explanation, yes. The young man subsequently vanished from society and nothing has been heard of him since. It's rather striking, then, that he should resurface now... don't you think?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Of course the convicted murderer couldn't really have come back to life. That's not possible. But Drebber's hair is unusually white, and if that really did happen overnight as a result of shock... ...it's hard to believe the incident was an out-and-out lie...)</span>

Madame Tusspells will have you take a position as a waxwork if you're not careful.

Yup! Toby's nose took me straight there! The boss an' the others are headin' over there now in a drag. So come on! Here's the address. I got the boss to write it out.

Oh, thank you, Gina! We'll make our way there at once.

......... Let's go, Mr Sholmes! You're coming!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Your words hearten me, I must say. But if I were to shirk my duties here... ...Madame would have me pay monetary recompense and Iris's dinner plate would be empty once more.

</p><p>Susato:<br />

</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Sadly not. We didn't find a soul in here.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh...what a shame.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, thank you for letting us know about this place and giving us the chance to investigate.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Accordin' to what Gina tells me, we only found it thanks to a clue that you lot turned up. I wouldn't wanna, say, go to Paris with a debt of gratitude unpaid now, would I?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Thank you.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Anyway, if you're hopin' to snoop around in here, I'd get crackin'. Lord van Zieks and the Forensic Investigation Team are on their way here as we speak.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Them again...

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... I see... So that's it...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Susato:<br />

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Here we go. I feel a great deduction coming...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />

</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! But how could you...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And the second conclusion... ...is that the small device on the floor there is without question completely <span style="color:#E16935">genuine</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Please, Mr Sholmes! You must explain everything!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...It would be a pleasure. After all, it is a great detective's civic duty to teach Scotland Yard the finer points of the trade.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, Inspector Gregson seems delighted with the idea, anyway.)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, you deflected the inspector's glare with such fortitude there, Mr Sholmes! Well done!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You're too kind, my dear madam. I hereby dedicate this great deduction to you. Kindly stand just there, Miss Susato.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh...yes. I'd be delighted!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So...shall we begin? Once again, Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!
</p>
<hr />
<center><b>The Great Deduction</b><br />
The game is afoot!</center>
<p><br />
<b>Topic 1</b><br />
Flipped Furniture
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It's plain to see that this room is in complete disarray. The bed, the table and chairs, the lamp... Everything is <span style="color:#E16935">upside-down</span>. Almost as if every item in the room had, until recently, been happily positioned on the ceiling... ...before <span style="color:#E16935">falling</span> straight down onto the floor.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Every item in the room was on the ceiling... Are, are you suggesting that...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed. The key here... ...is <span style="color:#E16935">gravity</span>. It would appear that technology has at last succeeded in freeing us from the great pull of the earth. For the gravity in this room was <span style="color:#E16935">reversed</span>, and then... suddenly <span style="color:#E16935">restored</span> to normality!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Goodness!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The <span style="color:#E16935"><b>inverted furniture</b></span> clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. I quite understand your scepticism, Miss Susato. I, too, was incredulous at first. However, my conviction in my analysis was cemented when I observed...this. <span style="color:#E16935">An anti-gravity device</span>...almost identical to one that featured in a dream of mine only the other day, in fact.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But, but then why does it have a clock on it?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
A most relevant question, indeed. That is a timing device that controls when the gravity direction will switch. There was clearly a requirement for the engineer to be able to restore normal gravity automatically. And the commotion we heard earlier from the other side of the door was the moment that restoration occurred. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>anti-gravity device</b></span>! So you see, we need look no further to explain the state in which we now find this room. The direction in which gravity acts in here was <span style="color:#E16935">reversed</span> by Mr Drebber... ...before being restored to normality in an automatic fashion some time later by the timer device! I have witnessed precisely this scene in a dream I once had when I fell out of bed.
</p><p><b>Topic 1</b><br />
Flipped Furniture
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
Because gravity was reversed
</p><p><br />
<b>Topic 2</b><br />
Missing Engineer
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now, let us consider the next conundrum: What was our engineer friend's aim? Indubitably, the greatest clue we have to explain his actions...is above our heads.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, how is it possible that there are footprints all the way up there on the ceiling?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
A question whose answer will lead us neatly to the truth, my dear madam. The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby <span style="color:#E16935"><b>skylight</b></span>! Of course, Drebber's aim was singular: to escape. However, there is but one way into this room. ...Excepting the skylight, that is.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
By inverting the gravity in here, Drebber was able to 'fall' conveniently to the ceiling... ...and make his escape via the otherwise inaccessible skylight, leaving those footprints behind on the way.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But the ceiling in here is very high, Mr Sholmes. If the gravity reversal was sudden, wouldn't Mr Drebber have fallen up to the ceiling rather violently?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm, 'falling up' is both scientifically and philosophically a rather interesting concept, I feel. But the man was cornered with nowhere to run, so escape through the skylight was his only option. You may recall that I found this in the room earlier, which I believe offers a solution.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! The rope...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this <span style="color:#E16935"><b>rope</b></span>? By anchoring one end to the wall, the man was able to 'lower' himself safely to the ceiling. Which explains how Drebber was able to escape this room before our arrival. He reversed the pull of gravity and fled via the skylight! And personally, I should very much like to reverse the pull of gravity again now...just for fun.
</p><p><b>Topic 2</b><br />
Missing Engineer
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
Escaped via the skylight
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this topsy-turvy puzzle!

</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She's completely spellbound...)</span> Um, Mr Sholmes...there is just one thing that troubles me.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I would expect nothing less. You're destined to be troubled by 'just one thing' for the rest of your life.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The thing is... Is such a thing actually possible? <span style="color:#E16935">An anti-gravity device</span>, I mean.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...I would say that with man's current scientific knowledge at the turn of the twentieth century... ...it's <span style="color:#E16935">no more possible</span> than instantaneous kinesis!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... But your whole deduction hinges on it!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, but my dear fellow... ...when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth... ...however improbable it may seem.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Haah...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It's a marvellous line, wouldn't you agree? One of my more enduring pearls of wisdom. I had Iris come up with the exact phrasing. My original was...clumsy.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes, I have a feeling I've read it in something that Miss Susato lent me once.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Actually...there IS one other thing, Mr Sholmes...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ah, the spell's broken at last.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The rope you found was on the floor, wasn't it?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed it was. In lonely coils near the wall.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But...if Mr Drebber had used it to escape in the way you described... ...wouldn't it still be tied to the wall?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... Mysteries inevitably unravel in the end. As, I think you'll find, do ropes. And as evidence of such, you need only look at the mystery we faced in this room, now skilfully unravelled.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That argument is as circular as the coils of rope...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I think perhaps we might need to give Mr Sholmes the usual little helping hand. I'm sure with some minor corrections, the great detective's great deduction will lead us to <span style="color:#E16935">the truth</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, you're right. And we must do it quickly, before Enoch Drebber gets too far away!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
If you're ready, then let us resume... ...Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!

</p><p>Susato:<br />
To think gravity could have been reversed in this very room! I find the whole idea utterly enthralling! Only Mr Sholmes could conceive of such an explanation!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But the man himself admitted it was a scientific impossibility, so...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, you're quite right. We must completely discount the idea at once.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ooh, that's unusually merciless of you, Miss Susato.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
'When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.' The great detective himself said so, didn't he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
While refusing to part with his dreams of anti-gravity devices...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Yes, I suppose so.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, let's see if examining this <span style="color:#E16935">topsy-turvy</span> scene a little more closely... ...reveals some proof that shows exactly what the gravity in this room was or wasn't doing!

'When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.' And eliminating the idea that gravity was reversed would be rash. Because all the upside-down furniture in the room is clearly screaming that it happened.

Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.

Oh...yes, that's true.

Unlike every other piece of furniture in the room, this safe is not upside-down. So a reversal in gravity can't be the reason for the state of this room!

Mr Naruhodo, I implore you to observe more closely. As you can see, the safe's feet is firmly bolted to the floor, saving it from any effects of gravity.

As you rightly say, though it appears at first glance that all the furniture in the room is upside-down... ...this unassuming, slender vase is standing keenly to attention. And unlike the large safe, there is nothing affixing it to the floor.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And it's the exception that breaks the rule.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
In short, much as it pains me... ...the gravity in this room was <span style="color:#E16935">never inverted</span> at all!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...My, my deepest sympathies for your loss.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, poor Mr Sholmes...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But the show must go on! So...let us continue with our deductions. Now that we know this contrivance is not in fact an anti-gravity device, there remains but one other possibility.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...You don't say.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Someone deliberately turned over every piece of furniture in here!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which might sound obvious, but leaves one mystery very much unsolved. Namely, why would anyone choose to do that?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Quite! And naturally, there is an explanation. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>anti-gravity device</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He's absolutely determined that this device must have something to do with it, isn't he?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm afraid the lure of an exciting scientific explanation is too strong.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...there's no doubt that somebody did this. Somebody turned all this furniture over. So whoever it was must have had <span style="color:#E16935">a reason</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm afraid nothing comes to mind at all, though.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, let's look around and see if the answer presents itself.

Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This unusual coal-burning heater certainly stands out, if you ask me. And I believe it's not just for heating, but also serves many other purposes. One of which, it may surprise you to learn, is controlling gravity in the room in which it's installed!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
In other words, it would automatically flip a fried egg? But I make a point of frying eggs on one side only. It's quite the proper way!

<p>Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>anti-gravity device</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Now we've shown it was nothing to do with gravity, we know somebody must have done this to the furniture. But who? And why?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, those are the questions we really need to answer!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well we at least need to resolve one of them here!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>safe combination</b></span>!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Precisely! I believe, Mr Naruhodo... ...that you had a very similar experience once, did you not?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! Last year... ...when I bought a lottery ticket and noted the ticket number down on the inside cover of a book just in case!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
That's it! For people are forgetful souls at heart, and always make a written note of important information.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Just keeping the ticket itself safe would be more sensible, I think.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And what, pray, happened next, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
When the day of the draw came round... ...I'd forgotten which book I'd written the number in and had to turn my room upside-down to find it!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
That's it! For people are forgetful souls at heart, and always forget where they've noted things down!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Not if you always note things in the same place...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I actually won the second prize, you know. But I couldn't remember which magazine I'd slipped the ticket into, so I had to turn my room upside-
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Thank you, Mr Naruhodo, but I believe I've proved my point now. Which is that a very similar scenario has clearly unfolded in this room.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Finding himself requiring access to the safe, the occupant of this room needed the combination code. He remembered that he'd written it on the underside of a piece of furniture, but forgot which one.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...Leading to the state in which we now find the room. Yes, Mr Drebber overturned all the furniture in here... ...in a desperate hurry to locate the combination code that would unlock the safe!

<b>Topic 2</b><br />
Missing Engineer
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
Escaped via the skylight
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now, let us consider the next conundrum: What was our engineer friend's aim? Indubitably, the greatest clue we have to explain his actions...is above our heads.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, how is it possible that there are footprints all the way up there on the ceiling?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
A question whose answer will lead us neatly to the truth, my dear madam. The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby <span style="color:#E16935"><b>skylight</b></span>!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, if a change in the direction of gravity can't explain it, then how did those footprints get there?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I feel as though that particular mystery has just become even harder to solve.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I can't think of any other way to explain it at all. Ooh... Life was so much simpler in those halcyon days when gravity could be reversed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was minutes ago. And those 'halcyon days' never existed in the first place.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, I suppose we must simply put our faith in Mr Sholmes and observe the area in more detail.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Being able to fly freely in the sky... That has been mankind's dream for centuries. And of course the balloon is the invention that's made that dream come true! Mr Drebber, clearly a man of dreams, used the balloon to ascend to the ceiling and plant his feet on the roof!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I take no pleasure in delivering bad news, but the undeniable truth is... ...it's clearly too small.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...?! I KNEW you were going to say that!

My dear fellow, then you are twice the fool. If people could fly in such small balloons, why would anybody ever manufacture larger ones? I despair of your lack of common sense at times, Mr Naruhodo!

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>shoe</b></span>!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And on closer inspection, there are clearly footprints all over the balloon as well. In other words, the aim was never the skylight at all, but the balloon.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But...for what purpose?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
A green balloon... Hmmm, that seems somewhat familiar data.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It was a piece of a green <span style="color:#E16935">balloon's envelope</span> that Mr Naruhodo and Iris found at the scene!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And inside the green balloon that Master Gotts claims he saw above the stage when the incident occurred... ...was the second birdcage. <span style="color:#E16935">The crux</span> of the whole instantaneous kinesis deception...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You, you mean to say...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
If we assume the balloon in here is a model of the one used on the day... ...there is a strong possibility something may be concealed <span style="color:#E16935">inside</span> it. <span style="color:#E16935">Something</span> our absconder was desperate to retrieve before making a hasty getaway.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but the balloon's out of reach!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hence why he resorted to a projectile. Namely...the shoe.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Most probably, Drebber intended to tear a hole in the envelope by assailing it with the shoe. However, his efforts were thwarted when the shoe itself became a prisoner of those lofty heights.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, dear... We desperately need to examine that balloon. If only there were some way we could see inside...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You may recall that I found this in the room earlier, which I believe offers a solution.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! The rope...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this <span style="color:#E16935"><b>rope</b></span>?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Mr Sholmes has managed to bring the deduction back to the rope!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright, I have to admit...that was clever. So we just throw the rope up to the balloon and then pull it down to us on the ground?

...Which is much easier said than done, I feel. And could take us a very long time as well.

True. Perhaps we need a more surefire method. In fact, we <span style="color:#E16935">already have one</span> of course, don't we?!

Oh, it's gone over your head, Mr Sholmes? Obviously, I was thinking of using it to examine the balloon.

On the contrary, nothing has gone over my head but this rope. For it is clearly the superior idea.

Aaaaaah!

W-What the...? A, <span style="color:#E16935">a waxwork</span>?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed it is. A waxwork head inside a metal mask. A mask that is shut tight and fastened with a strong and quite impenetrable lock.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So we can't see the face inside, that means.)</span>

I see you've joined the dots, Miss Susato. Excellent.

Ah! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Of course! A headless waxwork model!)</span> The case of the abducted Madame Tusspells model that you'd 'largely' solved... It was only the head of <span style="color:#E16935">the killer</span> that was still missing!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed it was. But I believe Madame Tusspells will now have to settle her sizeable account with me. This, as you have now surmised, is the head of the infamous <span style="color:#E16935">Professor</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But why is it here?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...This conclusively confirms my suspicions. The man responsible for stealing the Professor from Madame Tusspells... ...and returning it - sans tête - earlier today...was none other than <span style="color:#E16935">Enoch Drebber</span>!

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What on earth happened in here?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
You've <span style="color:#E16935">found</span> me, haven't you? No need to screw me down any further. Everything in here...is precisely <span style="color:#E16935">what it seems</span>.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yeah, well we'll be givin' it a thorough goin' over, don't you worry, Drebber.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
......... What fails to click with me... ...is how you were able to <span style="color:#E16935">locate</span> my workshop. That I was not expecting. When I heard <span style="color:#E16935">whistling</span> from the other room, I knew it was time to bolt.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Whistling?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah. That would have been me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
For some reason, I woke in fine fettle today!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(No words...just tightly squeezed chips...)</span>
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Clearly I must <span style="color:#E16935">have a screw loose</span>, though, as I couldn't remember the combination for the safe. And <span style="color:#E16935">another one loose</span>, as I couldn't remember on which piece of furniture I'd written it down.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We also found a rope over by the wall...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Yes, I had hoped to exit through the skylight, but sadly the rope was <span style="color:#E16935">too short</span>. So...I then set about <span style="color:#E16935">searching</span> for the combination code to open the safe.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And burning the incriminating blueprints, don't forget. Regrettably, though, you failed to retrieve the head from the balloon among the rafters.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And after that you hid yourself inside the safe? Having first set this 'parcel' ticking.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Well...I had <span style="color:#E16935">no intention of being nailed</span> by the police.

Got a death wish, have ya? Hidin' right beside a tickin' time bomb.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Please... Why do you suppose I chose to hide <span style="color:#E16935">inside the safe</span>? It's no ordinary safe. It's specially designed. A dynamite explosion <span style="color:#E16935">wouldn't leave a scratch</span> on it.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So in fact, the safe was the only 'safe' place.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Precisely</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But once you'd climbed inside, you wouldn't have been able to get out again...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
I invite you to <span style="color:#E16935">look more closely</span>. The safe is fitted with a handle on the inside, to allow the door to be unlocked <span style="color:#E16935">from within</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! So it is...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
I had always intended to <span style="color:#E16935">blow this place to smithers</span> in any case. I just wasn't expecting uninvited guests to <span style="color:#E16935">come along</span> and screw up my plans.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Do you...do you mean to say...you were plannin' to blow us all up?!
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
No. No. That was <span style="color:#E16935">unforeseen</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Most people run, you see. When they see a ticking time bomb <span style="color:#E16935">at their feet</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
I calculated <span style="color:#E16935">the time required for retreat</span> to a safe distance, and set the device accordingly. But your seemingly <span style="color:#E16935">endless</span> discourse in here threw a spanner in the works.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Is something wrong, Gregson? Do I have something on my face...besides the usual eyes, ears, nose and mouth?

<p><i>After clearing all Converse options:</i>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I think we have a fairly good idea of what's been going on here now. But what about the two incidents you've evidently been involved in recently?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Professor Harebrayne's instantaneous kinesis experiment at the Great Exhibition... ...and the waxwork model you stole, which this head belongs to.
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
That's <span style="color:#E16935">no ordinary head</span>, you know. That's the head...of the Professor. Clad in a mask with a lock so <span style="color:#E16935">strong</span>, I'm unable to open it safely to reveal the killer's identity. I've been considering carrying it around as...<span style="color:#E16935">protection</span>. After all-
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>That's enough!</center>
<p><br />
Sithe:<br />
What's going on here, Gregson? I'm sure you're aware that I have sole jurisdiction to investigate here.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Ah, um... Yes, well...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Dr Sithe again. So the Forensic Investigation Team are here...)</span>
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
And you know full well this engineer is a key witness. Why are you allowing this lawyer access to him? If Lord Stronghart knew of this, you'd be finished.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
You lot. Leave at once.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
My dear madam, there's no need for such a threatening tone, I assure you. After all, that's no way to greet an old acquaintance, is it, Dr Sithe?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Hello...Sholmes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Mr Sholmes knows Dr Sithe?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
If it's protecting the machine next door that's causing such a sour expression on your face, you are quite misguided. It's really nothing more than a shell, you-
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Get out!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But of course. We'll show ourselves the door. ...I see you haven't softened at all. Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It would appear that our delightfully entertaining investigations have run their course for today.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but Mr Sholmes...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Let us leave this place in the doctor's capable hands.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
I said get out! Now! All of you! Your presence here is not required either, Gregson.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... Understood. But I'll just say one thing before I head off: If it wasn't for this lawyer an' his companions... ...we'd never have found this place. And the whole workshop would've been blown to bits. There was a time bomb set in here that this lot disarmed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Inspector...
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
.........
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Kuh kuh kuh...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
...! Somethin' given you a chuckle, has it, Drebber?
</p><p>Drebber:<br />
Ah, so <span style="color:#E16935">sorry</span>. Didn't mean to offend. You're quite right of course. You did disarm <span style="color:#E16935">the time bomb</span>, didn't you? Yes... You did disarm <span style="color:#E16935">that one</span>.

Eh? Wot are you...? 'That' one? Ya, ya mean...?
