<center><span style="color:green">4th November, 9:30 a.m.<br />
The Old Bailey Courtroom</span></center>
<p><br />
Stronghart:<br />
Before we begin today, I have a brief announcement. As with the closed trial ten years ago, some astonishing facts have come to light in these proceedings. The revelation that the well known 'Reaper' is actually an organisation illegally executing its own brand of justice. And the discovery that a respected Yard inspector was at its heart until he himself perished in an assassination plot. Well...I say to all members of the judiciary here present on this occasion... ...that we will stop at nothing to uncover the whole truth behind these disturbing findings! Counsels...you will undertake this trial with the resolve to pursue the truth to the bitter end!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Resolve, yes... That's my intention.)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My Lord, if I may enquire...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The defendant may speak.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
On what grounds is Kazuma Asogi permitted to continue in his role as prosecutor?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
He has admitted to colluding with the victim in a plot to assassinate an innocent man. He shouldn't be enjoying the privilege of freedom, let alone be leading the prosecution.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I submitted a written petition to Lord Stronghart... ...requesting that judgement of my transgressions be delayed by one day.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You did what?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
In today's proceedings...I intend to expose everything. My whole life for the last ten years...has all been leading up to this one day!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Kazuma...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Whatever the outcome of this trial... ...I give my word that I will accept whatever punishment is deemed appropriate. However severe. And I suggest you prepare yourself for the same...Reaper!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Kazuma is bristling with hostility today. I get the distinct impression we're heading into very dangerous territory...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Is that really even Kazuma-sama standing before us?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
As an extreme exception to normal practices, I have granted this prosecutor's request. The defence finds this acceptable...I presume?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes, My Lord!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
In that case, in the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again. We resume the closed hearing...of Barok van Zieks!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The defence is ready, My Lord.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The prosecution is more than ready.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Very well, then. This preamble has taken long enough. Prosecutor Asogi...begin!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...As you wish, My Lord. The prosecution calls the first witness to the stand. Bring Seishiro Jigoku into the courtroom!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(At last, then...we've reached the final battle. He's putting literally everything on the line now in order to get to the truth. Come on, Ryunosuke. It's time for that steely resolve. Because this is going to test it to the limit!)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
Witness, state your name and occupation for the court.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Haah... So it was you who issued this, was it?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Your subpoena? ...I did what was necessary.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Hah hah hah hah hah hah! Well, look what the young man has become! I didn't think I'd see the day when you'd take that tone with me, I must say.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The witness will ensure his responses are pertinent to the questions asked.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
......... My name is Seishiro Jigoku, a Supreme Court judge from the Empire of Japan..
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Sixteen years ago, this man came to London as a visiting student. Six years later, he returned to Japan. As well as presiding over the Supreme Court, he is also currently Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I am of course fully aware of Mr Jigoku and his pre-eminent roles. I invited him personally to the International Forensic Science Symposium as a representative of his country. I hear he also played a key role in the conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Friendship and Navigation.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Ah, it was a great honour to be involved in the negotiations. I put my all into that treaty.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Judge Jigoku! I must ask...
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Well I never... Fancy the young murdering student turning up here of all places.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You acquitted me yourself... And now I'm a practising defence lawyer.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Yes...and full of self-importance like your friend across the courtroom, I see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You came here to London by invitation to the International Forensic Science Symposium. But then, without informing anyone of your plans, you took flight to France.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Took flight? I'd have to object to that turn of phrase.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then explain yourself! What exactly were the circumstances?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Well...I was somewhat expecting this. And I'm sorry to say... ...I decline to comment.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Leaving the country prematurely when I was an invited guest may be questionable etiquette... ...but my decision is unrelated to this case. I can't be bound to testify.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Unrelated, you say?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I appreciate that a respected police inspector has been killed, for which I offer my condolences. However, being an alien, I'd obviously never met the man. Nor do I know the first thing about him. As such, I'm in no position to testify. It's as simple as that.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So you would run from all this?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I beg your pardon?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
This case is more far-reaching than the murder of Inspector Gregson. It has ties to <span style="color:#E16935">another murder</span>. A case that was tried in Japan almost a year ago now.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
A year ago in Japan... The murder of Dr John H. Wilson, you mean?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right! And you, Judge Jigoku, are at the heart of both cases! The defence has evidence to prove it.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Well, Ryunosuke... I see from the look in your eyes... ...that you're resolved to carry this through to the very end, too.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Let's see your evidence, then. <span style="color:green">What proof do you have that Seishiro Jigoku is involved in this case?</span>

This is a telegram detailing a communication sent between Britain and Japan approximately one year ago. The communication contained four names: K. Asogi, A. Shinn... ...T. Gregson and J. Wilson.
</p><p>???:<br />

</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
You, you little... Where did you get that?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In Tokyo...from your office, Judge Jigoku.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
What?! How on earth did you...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What's this all about? Why is my name on that list?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This list of four names follows a certain <span style="color:#E16935">pattern</span>. T. Gregson and J. Wilson are the names of <span style="color:#E16935">victims</span>. K. Asogi and A. Shinn...are the names of <span style="color:#E16935">assassins</span>.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
No...
</p><p>A year ago in Tokyo... ...Dr John H. Wilson's life was taken in a Western-style restaurant in the capital. The culprit was found to be a visiting student who went by the name of Jezaille Brett. But her real name...was <span style="color:#E16935">Asa Shinn</span>, a professional killer sent on a mission to kill from Great Britain.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
A. Shinn and her victim J. Wilson...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And the murder that just took place here in London was <span style="color:#E16935">the counterpart</span> to that crime. An assassin sent from Japan, also a visiting student: Kazuma Asogi... ...whose victim was the British police inspector Tobias Gregson.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
K. Asogi and T. Gregson... One assassin from each country to kill a target residing in the other.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... What exactly is the defence suggesting?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
These two cases of murder, one that took place in Britain and one in Japan... ...were masterminded by a pair of individuals from each country as a form of <span style="color:#E16935">assassin exchange</span>! And the telegram the defence has acquired <span style="color:#E16935">is proof</span> of this international 'contract' to kill!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Wha...WHAT?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The telegram was found in your office, Judge Jigoku! In other words, the mastermind in Japan...was you!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Judge Jigoku...? What's this all about?!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And you, Kazuma... You lied.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
During yesterday's proceedings, you acknowledged that you'd accepted the assassination mission. But the mark wasn't Judge Jigoku at all. It was 'T. Gregson', Detective Inspector of Scotland Yard... ...as shown by the name on the killing contract!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... Very impressive, Ryunosuke. But actually, I didn't lie.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The name of the target I was ordered to kill never passed my lips yesterday. The idea that Seishiro Jigoku was the mark...came entirely from you!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! <span style="color:#0070C0">(You...deliberately avoided saying his name...?)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The defence claims these four names indicate some sort of international assassin exchange? I'm sure I speak for all present when I say that the very idea seems utterly absurd. Well, Mr Jigoku? What do you have to say for yourself?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
His silence only goes to prove his guilt!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There's another very important point that this new development brings to light. There's now a distinct possibility that the scene of Inspector Gregson's actual murder... ...was in the witness's cabin aboard the SS Grouse!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Hmmm...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Judge Jigoku, you have to testify now! To refuse would put you in contempt of court!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
......... Hah hah hah hah hah hah! There's no need for quite such a vicious stare, young man! Very well, then. As a parting gift to you all, I'll tell you everything I know.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... It seems this Japanese gentleman has information that the court must hear. About the alleged 'assassin exchange' and the events of the night of the 31st October. Present your formal testimony now.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
...As you wish, My Lord.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span><br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- The Assassin Exchange -</span></center>
<p>Jigoku:<br />
It's true that Kazuma Asogi was assigned the assassination mission one year ago now.<br />
The target was Inspector T. Gregson. That was a condition of the British study tour.<br />
However...in the end something happened that meant the young man was unable to carry out his mission.<br />
On the evening in question, a member of the crew was on duty outside my cabin at all times.<br />
If there'd been a shot fired, the crewman would have heard it. So clearly I can't be involved.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you admit it, then? As this communication suggests... ...there really was an assassin exchange arrangement between Britain and Japan!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
A political endeavour at the highest levels. Not something I can discuss here.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
To use such a worthy practice as foreign study to coerce somebody to commit murder... It's the most appalling thing I've ever heard!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Appalling? Well, it's easy to judge...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Pardon?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Asogi had <span style="color:#E16935">a reason</span> for taking his sword to that British inspector, you know.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Which is why he accepted the mission in the first place. Isn't that right...Counsel?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Kazuma-sama...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Judge Jigoku, if you are the mastermind behind this operation in Japan... ...then tell the court the identity of your counterpart in Britain!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
......... I'm not obliged to divulge that information.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
As I said yesterday, I've killed nobody. I freely admit that I accepted the mission, but on the night the plan was to be executed, I backed out. In short, this assassin exchange that the defence has identified is <span style="color:#E16935">unrelated</span> to the events of this case.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
The crucial point is this: Your police inspector can't have perished aboard that steamship in Dunkirk. Because if he'd been shot in the cabin, it's inconceivable that a member of the crew wouldn't have heard it.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
That's right. Gregson was killed after returning to London. In the room on Fresno Street. And the perpetrator of the crime was the Reaper, Barok van Zieks! The prosecution's accusation remains unchanged.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...To think that a seemingly innocent foreign exchange programme was a façade for such Machiavellian dealings. Clearly it's a plot only a government minister and high-ranking judge such as the witness could hope to execute.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Well, I seem to recall that it was someone on the British side who...controlled everything.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Be that as it may, it is not the place of this court to pursue this villainous assassin exchange plot. We are concerned only with the tangible events pertaining to the murder of Inspector Gregson. ...Is the defence clear on that point, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Yes, My Lord. I'll keep that in mind as I cross-examine the witness.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A year ago...when Kazuma was still in Japan, then.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Correct. It was at the examination centre for applicants for the study tour that I approached him.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I'll never forget it. I remember exactly what you said. You just came out and asked me forthright if I'd consider travelling to Britain on an assassination mission.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Surely not...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I thought it was a joke at first, of course. But then... ...it was made clear to me that if I didn't accept, I wouldn't be considered for the study tour.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So, so you agreed to it...just for that?! I mean, I know how much you wanted to study in England, but...assassination?!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
The Empire of Japan had accepted a proposal from the British Empire at the time. An agreement to send a student from each country to the other's to deepen cultural understanding and friendship. But behind the scenes, the chosen students were to be given assassination missions. I...had no choice but to accept the proposal that originated from my British counterpart.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Why? Why didn't you expose the plot there and then?!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
.........
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Britain acknowledges no part in these alleged misbegotten dealings. I advise you not to make spurious allegations... Foreign Minister Jigoku.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
As a witness, I am bound to tell the truth...My Lord. Anyway, I picked Asogi, and explained the details of the plan to him.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Why Kazuma? Why did you pick him as the assassin?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
He was the most capable of all the applicants. And in addition... ...I knew his desire to travel to Britain was very strong. In fact, it was almost more than a desire. It was his whole purpose in life.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, as his best friend, I can certainly attest to that. The way he threw himself into his studies... The way he pursued becoming qualified as a lawyer... It was all ultimately for that one single goal of being accepted on a study tour to Britain.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And of course, we know the reason behind that. He was determined to find out for himself the truth about his father, Genshin Asogi.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
There's nothing I wouldn't have done to get here. Be that agreeing to assume the role of an assassin... or betraying people's trust.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Well, you certainly did a fine job of betraying mine, Asogi.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But why was Inspector Gregson the target?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I have no idea. Those were the orders from Britain. I was in no position to question them.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You have no idea? Really? I find that hard to believe.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Oh do you?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Judge Jigoku was once a visiting student here in Britain himself, of course. Perhaps he has some connection with Inspector Gregson from that time...
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
The defence really ought to catch up.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
With what?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
With the fact that the assassin exchange has absolutely nothing to do with the case under scrutiny here. Yes, I've already admitted to recruiting Asogi...

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I presume you're referring to <span style="color:#E16935">the incident</span> that occurred during Kazuma's passage to Britain in January? The awful 'tragedy' that took place on the steamship...
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Word arrived at the ministry some two weeks after the ship's departure from our shores. The visiting student had been killed, but his body had somehow <span style="color:#E16935">gone missing</span> in Hong Kong. The news was wired to me from a detective I'd placed on the ship to accompany the assassin.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Obviously, Kazuma didn't actually die at all. But he did lose his memory. Including all details about his special mission.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Did you not consider dispatching another assassin at that point?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
That wasn't possible. Simply because... ...that black-clad young student over there had already put himself forward as Asogi's replacement. And there was no way to stop him from reaching Britain.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
My hands were completely tied.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So Mr Sholmes's strategy worked perfectly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He, he predicted everything that would happen...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Months later, my memory returned. But I'd never intended to go through with the assassination mission anyway.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
So you were playing me right from the outset, were you? Is that it?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I'd sooner be guilty of that crime than of taking someone else's life. I was prepared to do whatever I had to in order to get myself here to Britain.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
This line of questioning has gone on long enough.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
All the court should be concerned about in the testimony given by this witness... ...are details relating to his relationship with Inspector Gregson, and the victim's murder.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
In that case... ...as I've already made perfectly clear, I had no connection to the man or his death!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
And you have some means of substantiating this plea?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Outside your cabin in the first-class area of the SS Grouse, you mean?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Yes, that's right. Not least because there was a 'murder' of a student passenger earlier in the year, I imagine... ...the liner operators have taken to posting a crewman outside every first-class cabin door.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I can confirm the presence of the crewman guard myself.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Because I accompanied Inspector Gregson to Dunkirk that night, I witnessed it with my own eyes. There was a well-built crewman standing guard directly in front of the door to the witness's cabin.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
At that particular time, of course, I'd gone to the ship's dining room for dinner.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The inspector and I asked the crewman to allow us into the cabin while we waited for Judge Jigoku's return.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I suppose Inspector Gregson was there in his capacity as the Reaper... He was intending to take the witness's life.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Exactly. As I've said numerous times now, I had no intention of killing anyone.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So the crewman let two <span style="color:#E16935">potential assassins</span> into the cabin he was supposed to be guarding? Not the most convincing of sentries, really.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
In truth, those were my thoughts, too. But anyway, I stayed to talk with Inspector Gregson for a short while... ...and then I left him there and made my way off the ship alone.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Was the guard still at the door when you went?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes. He glared at me as I walked past.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
You see? That proves it.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The crewman who was standing directly outside your cabin door, you mean?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
That's right. A muscular man with a permanent grim expression on his face. He didn't once move from that spot. To be honest, I thought he was a miserable fellow. But as it happens, he's a vital witness now!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
There's no doubt that Gregson was killed by a gunshot. And it's inconceivable that a crewman standing just outside the cabin door wouldn't have heard that.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But wait! What about the ship's enormous steam engines? The noise of them could have drowned out the sound of the gun being fired!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Sadly, young judicial assistant, that won't wash.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
You will recall that my cabin was in the first-class area of the ship, which is also of course, the quietest. Don't imagine for a moment that it's anything like steerage where the judicial assistants go!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I, I didn't mean...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But a hole like that made by a bullet was found in your cabin, Judge Jigoku! That's compelling evidence that a gun was fired in there!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What's that? A bullet hole...?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Oh yes. You're talking about what the detective uncovered in the wall yesterday, I presume. That was obviously a rotten panel eaten out by woodworm. <i>[sic]</i> No doubt he didn't find an actual bullet.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's the hole in this argument...)</span>
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Sadly, I was unable to arrange for the crewman to be brought back to Britain with me. But obviously, if a gun had been fired in my cabin on the night in question as the defence implies... ...I would have been arrested on the spot, and would never have made it to Britain in the first place!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Very true. The witness's logic is sound. Since <span style="color:#E16935">no gunshot was heard</span> from the witness's cabin on the night in question... ...we must assume that the witness is telling the truth.

Heh heh heh... I'm glad you've seen sense, My Lord.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Judge Jigoku! This was found in your cabin yesterday.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
What is that? The crown of a pocket watch?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
A, a pocket watch...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And if you will observe, the victim's pocket watch, which we know he treasured... ...is missing precisely that part.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
It, it can't be...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Moreover, this crown is <span style="color:#E16935">a perfect fit</span> on the spindle protruding from the victim's watch.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Now, the fact that this was retrieved from Judge Jigoku's cabin... ...tells us that the victim's watch almost certainly broke there.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Grrr.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In other words, the victim was killed on the 31st during the twenty-minute evacuation drill... ...in the cabin occupied by you, Judge Jigoku!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
......... Well...you're razor sharp, aren't you, you young murderer...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Expertly manoeuvred, Ryunosuke.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And your argument sounds entirely plausible... ...at first. But rather like this pocket watch, it's full of cracks.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And I believe Judge Jigoku feels the same way.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I was wrong to acquit you earlier in the year.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
If I'd known that it would result in anyone having to listen to this drivel... ...I would have declared you guilty just to spare the world your ridiculous bombast.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I think it's clear... ...that the witness will have to give further testimony.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
When you hear what actually happened in my cabin that night... ...you'll notice the pitfall into which you've stumbled.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Prior to your renewed testimony, I would like to clarify one point: The fact that this part of the victim's watch was discovered in your cabin... ...means that you acknowledge he was there, I presume?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Yes, I do.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Very well, then. You may proceed to give your formal testimony... ...about what exactly happened in your cabin aboard the ship on the evening of the 31st October.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
...Of course. As a man of the law, I have no intention of obstructing justice.

<span style="color:#E16935">- The Events in the Cabin -</span></center>
<p>Jigoku:<br />
I had a guest waiting for me when I returned to my cabin after finishing my evening meal in the dining room.<br />
When I walked through the door, a mustachioed Englishman was there, foolishly waving a gun at me.<br />
I soon took care of him with an ippon seoi throw, though. He couldn't wait to run away after that.<br />
I imagine his watch was broken when I threw him over my shoulder. It has nothing to do with his murder.<br />
The inspector was clearly killed having returned to Britain. Because his body was found in London.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Stronghart:<br />
'Ippon seoi'...?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
A common jujutsu martial arts technique in my country. I was careful not to use too much force, but the man obviously landed too heavily for his watch to take.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So Ryunosuke Naruhodo... ...I imagine you can see <span style="color:#E16935">the flaw</span> in your logic now, can't you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The fact that the pocket watch was broken in the witness's cabin... ...in no way proves that the victim's murder took place there!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
AAAAAARGH!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I've no doubt the inspector intended to kill me. But he didn't manage to pull the trigger.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes, because he was merely the tactician. Not the Reaper's hand of death.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Well, the testimony appears to make perfect sense as far as I can tell.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Let me express my deep gratitude for your understanding, My Lord.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(But if this testimony holds... ...Judge Jigoku will be deemed to have had <span style="color:#E16935">no involvement</span> in the case!)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Well, Counsel? I really see no reason for wasting precious court time here on a cross-examination.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry, My Lord. The defence has a right to cross-examine. And I don't intend to squander that.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
You're an embarrassment to your countrymen... not knowing when you're beaten.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
In that case...proceed, Mr Naruhodo!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Because the so-called guard posted at your cabin door had just let your killer pass, you mean?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Apparently Gregson told the crewman he was a police inspector. ...Which was the truth, of course.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He wouldn't have had his identification with him, though...)</span>
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
He had his trench coat and moustache, not to mention the bag of chips. I imagine the crewman was convinced.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But the man accompanying him would have had two sword <i>[sic]</i> slung around his waist.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You mean me?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Who else?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Yes, that's true. You would have hoped the sight of a few swords might have set off alarm bells in the guard's head.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...The point is, I left the cabin before its occupant returned and I immediately disembarked the ship.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Certainly, all I can tell you is that only the inspector was waiting for me when I arrived back at my cabin.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
And you entered without any inkling of suspicion?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
That's right. None whatsoever.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Obviously you're talking about Inspector Gregson?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Yes, though at the time, I didn't know the man's name. And there was no time for introductions. I value my life over manners.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
By which you mean...that the inspector was there to assassinate you, I suppose?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
That was certainly the impression given by the gun pointing in my direction. But I've never seen the muzzle of a revolver shake about so much in all my life! Anyone would think the man had never shot somebody before.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Believe it or not, most of us haven't...
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Anyway, there was no time to call for the help of the crewman at the door. So I dealt with the man myself.

But surely all that commotion caused the crewman to come in, didn't it?

Hm? Yes, of course. He burst in immediately without knocking. The inspector hurled himself at the stocky fellow, and just managed to slip past him to make his escape.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The crown snapped off and the glass covering the face of the watch was cracked...
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Preferable to the man's head being pulled off or his spine cracking, wouldn't you say?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Not that the man was spared for long. A bullet to the chest soon saw to that. But the point is, the broken pocket watch doesn't prove that a murder took place.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Absolutely not! All the watch proves is the power of my jujutsu throw!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Whatever you say, it doesn't quite ring true that no shot was fired in that cabin. Because there was an obvious bullet hole in the wall.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But there's no evidence that proves the victim ever returned to London alive!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
...Just take a moment to think that idea of yours through now, stripling.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
If the inspector was killed on the steamship in France... ...how on earth could he have got back to Britain?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
When people die, their bodies remain at that same spot. ...It's a devil of a thing.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...then...obviously the culprit must have <span style="color:#E16935">moved</span> the body!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
How exactly? Carrying a corpse off a ship in your arms would raise a few eyebrows at least, don't you think?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...yes...that's true, but...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
All passenger luggage is inspected when it is unloaded from arriving vessels. And I would like to think the border police would query the corpse of an English gentleman as hand luggage.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
If the murder had taken place aboard the ship, you would imagine the body would have been disposed of at sea. There would be no sense in risking being caught by attempting to transport the body back to Britain.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's killed that idea then...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But...perhaps not!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Susato?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We've heard that the first-class passengers were under constant scrutiny by the crewmen posted to guard them. Which would mean that the culprit had <span style="color:#E16935">no opportunity</span> to dispose of the body in the sea.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...that's true! So transporting the body to Britain may have been the only viable alternative.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Dear me, you really are new to this, aren't you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I thought I'd been perfectly clear, but it seems I'm going to have to explain it in words you can understand. I think I ought to alter my testimony...with your consent of course, My Lord.

I have no objection. State your amended testimony now.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hmmm...there's an idea...
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Think about it, stripling. All passengers and crew disembarked at the same time and passed through the same checks at the border. The symposium guests were then driven straight to the hotel in carriages organised by the ministry.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And we met you as soon as you arrived at the hotel.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
So you did! Well then, remind me: did I have a corpse over my shoulder at the time?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...?! No!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
So we're in agreement then. I couldn't possibly have brought the inspector's body back to Britain. Unless of course they've developed some clever device these days to instantly move things from A to B!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Funny you should say that...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Professor Harebrayne's invention didn't actually work, if you remember, Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...of course.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The defence has become unusually quiet, I notice.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Yes. Because there's really nothing more to say.

I presume you recall this, Judge Jigoku? It's a photograph we took in the foyer of the hotel to mark the occasion. As the court will note, you have with you your large <span style="color:#E16935">travel trunk</span>. Large enough, in fact, to have a corpse inside!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
M-Mr Naruhodo! Surely you're not suggesting...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm afraid I am, yes. Three days ago, when we were chatting innocently with the new arrivals from Japan in the hotel... ...the body of Inspector Gregson was just metres away from us, inside Judge Jigoku's trunk!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Order! Order! Order in court! I'm sceptical, Counsel, that a grown man's body could fit inside even the largest travel trunk.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It could. Because I happen to know that <span style="color:#E16935">the witness himself</span>, a man of considerable size, fits inside his trunk. And verifying that would be extremely simple... wouldn't it, Judge Jigoku?!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But, but inside his trunk... How horrifying!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And after we'd spoken with you at the Great Waterloo Hotel... ...you had the opportunity to visit the apparent 'scene' on Fresno Street... ...taking your trunk with you in a cab, to deposit the inspector's body!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I don't have to listen to this nonsense!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Dr Gorey, the coroner who examined the body, has confirmed the possibility. She's acknowledged there are signs that steps may have been taken to <span style="color:#E16935">disguise</span> the true time of death. The onset of the body's decomposition could have been delayed by storing it in a refrigerator.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Counsel, as I remember explaining yesterday... ...refrigerators of the requisite size are few and far between.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I'm sure they are. But one place they're certainly found is on <span style="color:#E16935">large ocean liners</span>.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Such ships are equipped with electrically refrigerated cold rooms to keep food fresh on their long sea voyages. And the SS Grouse is no exception. Professor Mikotoba told me about it only yesterday. ...Well, Judge Jigoku?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
However much you prolong this debate, you can't eliminate the truth. All the evidence...points to you being the killer!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
......... Ha ha ha ha ha ha hah... Well, this is all very heartening.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I can see that it was a wise move letting Asogi and you embark on this study tour.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What are you talking about now?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Logical reasoning, of course. All court proceedings will be built on logical reasoning in the new century. And I can see that you've both laid firm foundations for that already!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Judge Jigoku, please! Stop diverting attention from the issue at hand! The defence has made an accusation against you. How do you respond?!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Respond? There's really no need for me to respond, is there?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Why ever not?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Because before you can even begin to answer the question of when the victim was killed... ...you must first establish one key fact: <span style="color:#E16935">Where</span> was the victim killed? ...It's quite logical.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The actual scene of the crime...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The prosecution's stance is unaltered. The killing took place on Fresno Street when the gunshot was heard... ...as the accused, Barok van Zieks, shot the victim at point-blank range!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Since no tangible evidence exists to disprove the prosecution's claim at this time... ...the defence's deductions amount to little more than an elaborate fairy tale.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I'm afraid that's how the logical reasoning the British are known for really works, young stripling.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... The victim was shot in that little room on Fresno Street and died instantly? I'm afraid it's the prosecution's claim...that's the only fairy tale here.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
How can you say that?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Quite simply... Because that claim directly <span style="color:#E16935">contradicts</span> a certain piece of evidence in our possession.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Very tantalising, Counsel. I think you had better explain yourself to the court, don't you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The prosecution claims that Inspector Gregson died instantly when he was shot at the scene on Fresno Street. <span style="color:green">But this evidence clearly contradicts that claim!</span>

I'm sorry to disappoint you, but your logic is flawed. He could easily have adopted that foetal position due to the pain of the shot which subsequently proved fatal.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Judge Jigoku, but it's your logic that is flawed.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
According to this autopsy report, the victim <span style="color:#E16935">died instantly</span>. He would have felt no pain, much less have been able to draw himself into that position.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which begs the question of why the victim's body is curled up in that way. Though the answer should be abundantly clear by now.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
You're, you're suggesting...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The inspector's body took on that posture ahead of its arrival on Fresno Street... ...before it was coldly <span style="color:#E16935">turned out</span> on the floor...from the inside of a large travel trunk!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
No!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Y-You're quite right... The shape of the body... It looks exactly as if it had been kept in <span style="color:#E16935">a confined space</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Judge Jigoku, present your trunk for examination! I believe it's very possible that it will contain traces of the victim's <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span>!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
AAARGH! ......... Present my trunk? I refuse!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
On what grounds?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
......... I'm the Minister of Foreign Affairs from the Empire of Japan! I shouldn't have to put up with this treatment just because of some stripling's baseless accusations!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
In other words, Judge Jigoku... ...there is blood in your trunk!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
At this moment, you're not a government minister. You are a witness in a trial in Britain's highest court!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't care who you are or what your status outside this courtroom might be, you will NOT withhold information! Nothing is more important than the truth!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Ugh... UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Order! Order in court! Well, Mr Jigoku...what's it to be?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You can't be serious! You did it?!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
......... Have you no shame at all...Kazuma Asogi?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
......... Very well, I admit it. I did bring the inspector's body into the country. Inside my trunk...exactly as postulated by the defence.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...?!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Dear God! Outrageous!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So it WAS you! You admit to Inspector Gregson's mur-
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
No! I admit to nothing more than what I've said.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Of killing the man, I certainly have no recollection.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
What on earth is that cryptic statement supposed to mean?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I merely disposed of the inspector's body, which was left in my cabin. In order to avoid unwanted attention. As the judicial assistant over there pointed out, I had no chance to throw it into the ocean. So...I decided my only option was to bring it into Britain with me and dispose of it somewhere else.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You, you can't still deny it! If you didn't do it, then who on earth did kill the man?!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
As you know, there was one other person in my cabin that night. He had <span style="color:#E16935">the opportunity</span>. And moreover, he'd already accepted <span style="color:#E16935">a mission</span> to take the inspector's life.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
That's right! Who else could it have been?! It was you...Kazuma Asogi!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........You... I never thought you'd stoop to this, Seishiro Jigoku.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
You've taken the words straight out of my mouth... 'Prosecutor' Kazuma Asogi. You thought by leaving the body in my cabin you could pin the crime on me, did you?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Well...the prosecution counsel has already admitted to visiting the witness's cabin on the night in question.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Yes, on <span style="color:#E16935">an assassination mission</span>, no less.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You, you wouldn't...
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
So...what do you make of that, young stripling? You've heard my testimony now. And that's all I have to say on the matter. I'll admit to nothing more!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I, I don't believe this...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Counsel for the Defence... ...what is your position now? The court awaits your response to the witness's assertion. The assertion that on the night in question, the victim's assailant was in fact <span style="color:#E16935">Mr Kazuma Asogi</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This isn't the dead end it seems to be. The answer's right in front of me. It comes down to Jigoku...Or Kazuma. Both of them had <span style="color:#E16935">the opportunity</span> to kill Gregson, but only one of them did it. And I'm just <span style="color:#E16935">a step away</span> from proving who!)</span> Very well. The defence is ready to respond to the assertion put forward by Judge Jigoku. <span style="color:green">The idea that the victim's murder could have been committed by Prosecutor Asogi is...</span>

This itinerary for crew members of the SS Grouse, My Lord. This is conclusive proof!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
An itinerary? How does that prove anything?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Judge Jigoku! The moment you acknowledged that you found the victim's body in your cabin... ...this itinerary suddenly became <span style="color:#E16935">much more significant</span>!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
What? ...Why?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
On the night in question, as always, a crewman sentry was on guard outside your cabin door. As long as he was there, nobody could have fired a shot inside the cabin.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Absolutely. Because it's <span style="color:#E16935">inconceivable</span> that the guard wouldn't have heard it and come to investigate.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So that tells us that the crime must have taken place when the guard was elsewhere. And that narrows it down to <span style="color:#E16935">the twenty minutes</span> just after ten o'clock, as indicated on the itinerary.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Yes, I see no flaw in your reasoning so far.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But the crucial point is this: when the evacuation drill took place... ...the steamship had already <span style="color:#E16935">put to sea</span> from the port of Dunkirk.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Now, clearly the murder could only have been committed by <span style="color:#E16935">somebody who was aboard the vessel</span> at the time. But Prosecutor Asogi stated in yesterday's proceedings...

I didn't come to Great Britain to take anyone's life. So I left Gregson and disembarked the ship. I spent that night at a boarding house in the town, and returned to England the following morning.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which I'm sure the court will agree is conclusive proof... ...that Kazuma Asogi <span style="color:#E16935">couldn't possibly</span> have carried out the killing!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, that's out of the question. Isn't it, Kazuma?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...As the defence rightly recalls... ...I disembarked the vessel and spent the night in a boarding house in Dunkirk. And as I said yesterday, I <span style="color:#E16935">signed my name</span> in the accommodation's register book. All extremely easy to verify...and undeniable proof!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Agh! No! I...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There's no escape this time! You can forget that you're a judge or a government minister. It's time you gave the court an honest answer, as a common man.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Grrrrrrrrr...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You killed Inspector Tobias Gregson and transported his corpse back to Britain. Then you dumped the body in the room on Fresno Street and made it look as if the murder had happened there. That's what really happened, isn't it...Seishiro Jigoku?!
</p><p>Jigoku:
</p>
<center>It was that damned trial ten years ago... That's when all this began. Looking back now, my fate was decided that day. I was doomed already. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!<br />
It's over! My life...is over.</center>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">'A British assassin to eliminate a professor in Japan. A Japanese assassin to eliminate a detective in Britain. Both assassins will use diplomatic immunity to evade conviction and return safely to their homelands.'</span></center>
<p><br />
Jigoku:<br />
The assassin exchange request arrived from Britain about one year ago. ...Though it was hardly a request. It was <span style="color:#E16935">a demand</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And for that, you decided to recruit Mr Asogi. But things didn't go according to plan. Your chosen assassin never made it to Britain. And you found yourself unable to dispatch a replacement... ...because I was already on my way to Britain at that time in Kazuma's place.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
And that left me with only one option for carrying out my obligation: To eliminate the mark myself. Personally. Of course, there was but a single opportunity for me to do that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The International Forensic Science Symposium, I presume?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
That's right. I decided it would be safest to carry out the plan before my arrival in Britain. So I enlisted the help of my British counterpart... ...and made arrangements for a pretext that would take the inspector to Dunkirk. To lure the man in, he was given a sham mission by the Reaper.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
W-What?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(The Reaper...?)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
But there's only one person who could have done that! The mastermind of the entire operation: <span style="color:#E16935">the Reaper himself</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So...that means that the assassin exchange was... It was all planned by the Reaper!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
......... I'm not at liberty to say anything about my British counterpart. Anyway, the inspector accepted the Reaper's mission and dutifully infiltrated my cabin on the steamship. But it was all a trap designed to lead him to France... and his own death.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, how awful...
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
It was past nine o'clock when I returned to my cabin from the dining hall that evening. I didn't give him time to attack me. I choked him until he lost consciousness. But there was a guard just outside the door, so I left it at that for the time being. Even the slightest noise might have aroused suspicion, so I <span style="color:#E16935">bided my time</span>, waiting...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
For <span style="color:#E16935">the twenty minutes</span> after ten o'clock...
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I had intended to finish him by strangulation. But moments before I had the chance... ...he suddenly came round and went for me in a reckless move.
</p>
<hr />
<center>*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<p>Jigoku:<br />
I'd received the British-issue gun sixteen years earlier, being a member of the judiciary as a visiting student. ...I never imagined I'd have to use it for something like that.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
So the revolver belongs to you, does it?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then the victim was killed inside your cabin on the SS Grouse. Which begs the question... ...of why you arranged for his body to be discovered in the room on Fresno Street.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
...The young judicial assistant over there has already answered that question. There was no way I could take the body up on deck to throw it over the side. That's precisely where all the crewmen were gathered for the evacuation drill. So before the first-class cabin sentries returned, I took the corpse to the refrigeration room.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And then on arriving in Dover, you concealed the body in your trunk in order to smuggle it past the border police.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I knew I needed to take steps if the police were to be convinced when the body was found in London.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
In that case...you must have known. You must have had intimate details of Inspector Gregson's intended <span style="color:#E16935">schedule</span>.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Yes. My British counterpart sent me everything I needed to know. The inspector was due at Fresno Street at five o'clock that afternoon. In order to meet a man by the name of Hugh Boone, from whom he would take back his police identification.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I decided that man would be the perfect person to set up as the culprit. So I took a hackney carriage over there with the body still in my trunk.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That must have been just after we took this photograph with you at the hotel, then...
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Yes, I wasn't expecting a welcome committee. I was more than a little nervous. On Fresno Street, I spotted a young girl selling little firecrackers.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Miss Venus of course...)</span>
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I conceived of the candle trick there and then. So I donned a simple disguise and approached the girl to buy enough firecrackers to replicate a gunshot.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What sort of disguise?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
For some reason, the inspector had a bright red hairpiece in his own travelling case. So I put that on. Although I suspect I drew more attention to myself in that than I would have otherwise.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The hairpiece we found at the scene. The inspector had it ready for the Red-Headed League investigation.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I only arrived at the room at around quarter to five. So I quickly placed the body on the floor, moved the noticeboard and set up my little candle trick. I arranged it so the firecrackers would go off with a bang around fifteen minutes later.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
So that Mr Boone, who was due to arrive at five, would walk straight into a trap?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Except...at the last moment, I made a careless blunder.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What was that?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I imagine...it was the bag of <span style="color:#E16935">fish and chips</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
I didn't notice that it had fallen out of his overcoat pocket when I moved the body to the refrigeration room. I put it back into his pocket the following morning, but... Well, it seems the warmth of the heated cabin had accelerated the decay of the fish. ......... Anyway, that's... That's everything. All the sordid details of what I did.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Stronghart:<br />
I've heard enough. We've arrived at the truth about the murder of one of the country's most capable and respected police inspectors. The witness will be tried in the coming days. For a crime of such a vile nature...you can expect the most severe penalty.
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
An exchange of assassins... What a foolhardy idea...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Jigoku! One last detail! Who was your counterpart in Britain? Who was the mastermind behind the assassin exchange?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Nothing you say now can make matters any worse for you! Just tell us!
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
Eeeeeenough! I've already told you...that I cannot say!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Even though as things stand, you may very well never set foot in your homeland again?
</p><p>Jigoku:<br />
......... What are you waiting for? Can't we get this over with now?! It's finished...all of it! ...I'm finished...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Then, in the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I now pronounce the findings of this court. This man before us has admitted to the wilful murder of Tobias Gregson. Seishiro Jigoku, it is the opinion of this court that you should be found...
</p>
<center><b>Guilty</b></center>
<p><br />
Stronghart:<br />
And may I remind all those present of the strict confidentiality demanded by this closed court!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Stronghart:<br />
Moments ago, Mr Jigoku signed a written confession... ...admitting to the murder of Inspector Gregson, and the subsequent conveyance of the body. In short, the defendant's innocence has therefore been established beyond doubt.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, wonderful! Well done, Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, um...thank you.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Is something wrong?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I'm...just a little troubled... ...by his <span style="color:#E16935">silence</span>.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The true identity of the Reaper of the Bailey... And this extraordinary 'assassin exchange'... We do remain in the dark about these mysteries. However... ...insofar as the indictment brought against the defendant in this trial, we have reached a conclusion.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I have every intention of pursuing both mysteries... ...as a prosecutor.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...As you wish. Now, for the formal adjudication... I hereby declare the defendant, Barok van Zieks.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The prosecution calls for adjudication to be deferred.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Counsel...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The accused's innocence hasn't been fully established at all. And therefore, it would be wrong to deliver a verdict at this time. That is the prosecution's unwavering position!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
W-What?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But...Judge Jigoku has already confessed!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Nevertheless... ...Barok van Zieks has committed crimes for which he must be punished.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Well... ...it would appear you have information that the court needs to hear, Prosecutor Asogi.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Certainly, the murder of Inspector Gregson was actually carried out by Seishiro Jigoku. But it's clear from the witness's testimony that he was coerced into complying with the plot. Into this sick, merciless assassin exchange!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That, that may be true, but...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So what I want to know is, who coerced Jigoku? Who was pulling the strings?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The victim went to France having been ordered on a mission for the Reaper...only to be murdered. In other words, the mastermind behind the assassin exchange is someone in a position to give such an order. As we've already established...the Reaper himself.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Well, certainly, that would appear to follow...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The prosecution hereby formally accuses the man in the dock, Barok van Zieks... ...of being the Reaper of the Bailey! And furthermore... ...I'm going to prove his guilt beyond all reasonable doubt!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Order! Order! Order! The Reaper of the Bailey...is a long-standing mystery, Counsel. Are you suggesting you have some new information with which to build a case?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Scotland Yard has already investigated Lord van Zieks very thoroughly in that regard. And they found no evidence whatsoever to substantiate the claim that he is the Reaper.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Perhaps. But circumstances have now changed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It's already been established that the assassin exchange was negotiated with Jigoku by the Reaper himself. Which means we now have a new line of questioning by which to identify definitively the man's identity. That is the prosecution's intention here.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I must say I'm surprised... ...by quite how tenaciously you appear to want to besmirch my name.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... You are guilty of an unforgivable crime, Lord van Zieks. And I will bring you to justice for it...whatever it takes!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That explains Kazuma's silence before. He'll stop at nothing to finish what Lord van Zieks unwittingly started ten years ago...)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... Very well. Whilst it's extremely irregular... ...I will on this occasion grant the prosecution further opportunity for witness testimony. The defendant will disclose any and all involvement he has had with the Reaper and the assassin exchange!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I thank you, My Lord, for guiding the court so wisely.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I hereby declare this court to be in session for a supplementary hearing!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Pray turn a blind eye to the discourtesy as I verify that this vile and unremitting accusation... ...hasn't soured the contents of my hallowed chalice.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Lord van Zieks!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I first had to suffer the pseudonym of the Reaper ten years ago now. And ever since that time, I've endured the weight of implied guilt that's gone with it. So I welcome the chance to testify now...and crush those allegations once and for all.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Good. Then let justice decide...Lord van Zieks. The prosecution seeks to begin building its case by calling the accused to the stand as the primary witness... ...in order that he may answer the accusation brought by the prosecution that he IS the Reaper of the Bailey!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
And what says the defence?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Putting the defendant in the witness stand can be extremely dangerous. And Kazuma-sama is so emotional at the moment. He's not thinking logically!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You're right that he's not himself. But I knew it would be like this. And I came here today determined to face him through whatever might arise. As a lawyer...and as his friend.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Then that's what we must do!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The defence has no objection, My Lord!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Very well. Defendant, you will take the witness stand... ...and give formal testimony on the subject of your involvement with the Reaper...and the assassin exchange!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As you wish...My Lord.
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span><br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- The Reaper and the Assassin Exchange -</span></center>
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
I've never taken the life of another. Nor have I instructed another to kill.<br />
I've been investigating the truth behind the Reaper for years. And I was aware of Gregson's involvement.<br />
That's the reason why I went to Fresno Street that day, and how I came to discover the body.<br />
The point is, no common thread exists between myself, Gregson and Dr Wilson.<br />
Clearly, therefore, there's no reason to suspect me of being behind the assassin exchange.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Stronghart:<br />
So you deny all accusations by the prosecution? Both that you are the Reaper of the Bailey, and that you masterminded the assassin exchange.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I acknowledge that the public at large believe me to be the Reaper. However, that's a fallacy, which I alone am in a position to foreswear.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Naturally, the prosecution believes the testimony just given by the accused to be untrue. Ryunosuke Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Let me ask you: why are you here? What really brings you to this courtroom?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... A desire to uncover the truth.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Even if the truth proves your client to be guilty?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... From all my experiences in this courtroom, I've come to realise something: The truth can't be hidden. Sooner or later, it will come out.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So it's always my intention to work with my client in pursuit of the truth.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... I want you to remember what you just said.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Enough dilatory chatter. Counsel for the Defence, proceed to cross-examine the witness.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...Yes, My Lord! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I know exactly what you're thinking, Kazuma. I know you're just waiting to point it out. <span style="color:#E16935">The contradiction</span> you're convinced lies somewhere within this man's testimony...)</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you're not what the general public refer to as the infamous Reaper of the Bailey?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Exactly.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Don't imagine for a moment that the court will be satisfied with a one-word answer on this.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I realise that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If you're intending to comment on every sentence, this could take a while, Kazuma...)</span> Didn't you find it...disturbing, though? That one by one, defendants who'd been acquitted after your unsuccessful prosecution were killed?

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Disturbing?! I couldn't possibly say how that would make me feel with a one-word answer like that!

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well...that told me...)</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You say 'for years'... How long exactly?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Since the very first time the Reaper's influence was felt in this courtroom...ten years ago now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And your investigations led you somehow to Inspector Gregson, you're saying?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...I didn't want to believe it. He was a personal acquaintance. We'd worked on cases together in the past.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A friend...even?)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It felt like a betrayal, but...I demanded permission to search his office at the Yard without his knowledge.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Which is when you found his secret notebook, is it?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It's when I first learnt of the location he'd noted only as 'Grouse' and the appointment at 5 p.m. on the 31st. Though I didn't know the significance of those details at the time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So now we're at the nub of the matter...)</span>

I thought that if it was the Reaper's headquarters... ...then by turning up there at five o'clock, I would catch whoever was involved red-handed. Sadly, all that was awaiting me... ...was the inspector's corpse.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes... Even though it wasn't designed for you, you walked straight into <span style="color:#E16935">the trap</span> set by Jigoku.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Exactly. Jigoku had intended to implicate Hugh Boone. But unhappily for me, I arrived at the scene first.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Hah! A ridiculously careless blunder!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Moved on to just throwing insults around, I see then, Kazuma...)</span>

Think what you will. It doesn't change the truth.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There is a link between you and Gregson, though.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Of course. We were close acquaintances. We'd worked on numerous cases together. I considered the man to be a mentor of sorts. He taught me a number of <span style="color:#E16935">important lessons</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
H-He did? Such as what?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Where to buy good fish and chips...and suchlike.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well...that was convincing.)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Dr Wilson was a coroner, of course, but that was some time in the past. And in any case, I understand it was several years ago now that he was invited to work at a Japanese university.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's right. He was a visiting professor at the Imperial Yumei University in Tokyo.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It should be unambiguously clear then, that no link exists between myself and him. In other words, I had no motive for sending some assassin across the oceans to kill the man.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Perhaps there is some reason that would explain why he masterminded the assassin exchange. And if a reason could be established later in these proceedings... ...then the accused's claim in this testimony that he wasn't involved would amount to <span style="color:#E16935">perjury</span>.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(A convincing testimony by Lord van Zieks...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Certainly, with no apparent connection between the three men, there's no way to establish a motive. The testimony seems unassailable as far as I can see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear me! What a bleak expression!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I agree, there doesn't appear to be any particular link between them...at first glance. But with <span style="color:#E16935">the inclusion of one other person</span>... ......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I must be over-thinking it, surely...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Another person, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I need to think back over all the information we've gleaned so far.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Alright. And I'll review my notes about the case and all the evidence in the Court Record!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Could it be...that Lord van Zieks has something to hide after all...?)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Stronghart:<br />
What is this? An autopsy report? Wait...this is ten years old...from the autopsy of Lord Klint van Zieks!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?! My brother's autopsy report?!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I'm pleased to see the defence doesn't intend to run from the undeniable truth.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Order in court! What reason do you have for presenting a ten-year-old autopsy report here, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This...the autopsy report of the Professor's final victim... ...is an indelible link between Inspector Gregson, Dr Wilson...and the defendant!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Not that accursed name again! The Professor...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I've personally researched all of the court records relating to that case. I know that at the time, autopsy was considered sacrilege to the victim's souls. And for a member of the aristocracy like Lord Klint van Zieks, it was unthinkable. But someone implored the powers that be to allow the autopsy to go ahead: Inspector Gregson. He declared that he was certain he would obtain conclusive proof from the procedure.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And it was Dr Wilson who conducted the autopsy. His signature is clearly visible on the document!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As promised by Gregson, the autopsy did indeed produce evidence. Evidence that conclusively proved Genshin Asogi was guilty of the murders. In my brother's dying moments, he mustered all his remaining strength to leave that vital clue behind.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Indeed. That was the key to indicting the Professor for his crimes and the conclusive evidence that convicted him. It enabled Lord van Zieks here to avenge his brother's senseless death...with a marvellous victory in court.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
A marvellous victory, was it? I wonder if that's really true.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Could the same be said if it turned out that the key piece of evidence in question was in fact <span style="color:#E16935">fabricated</span>? If the inspector, the coroner and the prosecutor all colluded together... ...to cast an innocent Japanese man as a mass murderer and send him to his death!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
That's outrageous!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And now, ten years later, for some reason the secret has been threatened and needs protecting. Which is why the inspector and the coroner had to be silenced...isn't it? By someone in power in Japan and in Britain...using the two killers recruited for the assassin exchange!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Order! Order at once!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ten years ago, my father was convicted in this very courtroom as a mass murderer...to be sentenced to death. But it was all a sham! And I swore to myself that I'd prove it. Which is why I HAD to come to Britain... whatever the cost!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You'll have to forgive me if I feel compelled to toast this vengeful Nipponese's tenacity of purpose here. However... ...he who fails to quash his emotions in the courtroom... has failed as a lawyer.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Come on, Kazuma! You know this won't wash! You're claiming your father was misrepresented in a trial that took place a whole decade ago! You must see that without evidence, that's nothing more than a wild accusation!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
As it happens...I have evidence.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
WHAT?!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
As the court has heard, I crossed the Channel to France with Gregson on the 31st. I went with him on the pretext of being the assassin recruited to kill Seishiro Jigoku. But my true intentions...were to make the inspector tell me the truth.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What truth?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The truth about the evidence. And he acknowledged what I'd already deduced: There's <span style="color:#E16935">a closely guarded secret</span> about what went on in that autopsy ten years ago.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What? A secret? ...I know nothing of any secret!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
While we waited for my supposed 'mark' in Jigoku's cabin... ...I drew my clan's illustrious sword, Karuma, before the inspector's eyes. He very quickly understood what my true motive was.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gregson:<br />
Right, I see... You're that Asogi's young lad, are you? And what? You're gonna cut me down with that thing, is that it?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
That will very much depend on the answers you give to my questions. I want to know what really happened ten years ago. The truth. That's all.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... Before we get into it, let me make one thing clear: I still believe your father was the Professor. There's no doubt in my mind. But unfortunately back then...we didn't have the evidence we needed to make the crime stick.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So...you admit it then? The evidence used in my father's trial was <span style="color:#E16935">fabricated</span>?!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... It was for the good o' the country. Anyway...I was just followin' orders.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Orders? What exactly did you do? ...Speak!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I'm not sayin' another word.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Even if your life depends on it?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That's right. Even then.
</p>
<center>*Shing!*</center>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So that's when the tip of the sword broke...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, Kazuma-sama...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
If the results of Klint van Zieks's autopsy were <span style="color:#E16935">fabricated</span>... ...then the investigating officer, Gregson, and the lead coroner, Wilson, must have known about it. And they can only have been ordered to pervert the course of justice in that way by one man: The man leading the case for <span style="color:#E16935">the prosecution</span>, Barok van Zieks!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
In other words, the defendant DID have cause to organise this exchange of assassins!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Exactly. And as was established earlier... ...it has to have been <span style="color:#E16935">the Reaper himself</span> who liaised with Jigoku in Japan to arrange the exchange.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So it follows that the Reaper's true identity... ...can only be that of the man who stands accused in this courtroom today, Barok van Zieks!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

Gregson's dead now. Unless you were thinking of summoning a ghost to the stand?

You, you mean to say...?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I forget how the system works in your little backwater country... ...but in the courts of the British Empire, without evidence, there is no case. I have no intention of entertaining some <span style="color:#E16935">wild fantasy</span> that can't possibly be substantiated by anyone or anything!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
AAAAAAAAARGH!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Order! Order in court! Following Inspector Gregson's murder and in the light of Dr Wilson's death as well... ...there's really no one left who could testify about the events of ten years ago...is there?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So that was <span style="color:#E16935">the real purpose</span> of the assassin exchange...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
This court has no business raking over the coals of a case that was concluded a decade ago. The accusal brought by the prosecution and the defence is categorically denied. I take it there are no objections?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Kazuma... He's more or less waited his whole life for this moment. Is there really nothing else we can do now?

"The person the defence would like to call to the stand to testify about the autopsy of Lord Klint van Zieks is..."
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Stronghart:<br />
Heaven help us. Another Japanese?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
An expert in forensic medicine, My Lord. Professor Yujin Mikotoba. Sixteen years ago... ...he came to London with Seishiro Jigoku and Genshin Asogi as a visiting student.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
And what could his testimony possibly tell us?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Professor Mikotoba was the primary assistant during the autopsy in question. He was also the person who actually penned the report!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Incorrect. The autopsy was carried out by the coroner, Dr Wilson. The report carries his signature.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It was the primary assistant's duty to keep a written record of the coroner's work during the procedure. In actual fact, the coroner merely read over the report at the end and signed it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In other words, Professor Mikotoba witnessed <span style="color:#E16935">the entire autopsy</span> from start to finish. The defence demands that Professor Mikotoba be summoned as a witness as a matter of urgency! Whatever really happened in that autopsy laboratory ten years ago...is something only he can tell us!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The defence's demand is denied.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But Professor Mikotoba is in London at this very moment! We could summon him to the stand in minutes!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(No, of course he's not going to agree to it. Stronghart has no intention of summoning anyone who knows. He's too concerned about <span style="color:#E16935">protecting himself</span>!)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Prosecutor Asogi, let me refresh your memory, as you seem to have forgotten the prosecution's stance: Only minutes ago, you accused the defendant of being the Reaper and of masterminding the assassin exchange.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I, I did, yes...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
So present your evidence for those claims and make your case complete!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I...I... At this time, I don't have the requisite evidence. But that's exactly why we need witness testimony!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The Professor case is closed. There are no clues in the distant past that will bolster your argument today. I'm afraid to say, Prosecutor Asogi... ...that you would appear to be possessed by the spirit of your late homicidal father.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Now, as I stated earlier, this court has already reached a conclusion with respect to the matter at hand. Inspector Gregson was murdered by Japanese Supreme Court Judge Seishiro Jigoku. As for any hidden circumstances that may exist, they will be investigated in due course by the proper authorities.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Sholmes was instrumental in the apprehension of Seishiro Jigoku before he fled from Europe. The court should hear what he has to say!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Lord Mael Stronghart... ...it's imperative that you refrain from bringing this trial to an end at this stage.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Is it really? And why would that be?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You need only recall your own words from the opening of the trial to answer that question. If I may... 'We will <span style="color:#E16935">stop at nothing</span> to uncover the whole truth behind these disturbing findings!' Surely it can't be... ...that the shock of being accused of being the Reaper yourself has erased that from your memory...can it?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The whole truth, sir, has already been uncovered!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... It would seem that we have a great many important members of the judiciary present here today. I put it to you, my dear fellows...should the trial end at this juncture? After all, why have you been invited to attend? To nod along to the prevarications of your superiors?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Order! Order in court!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It seems to me that we stand before a door that leads to a new era of legal practices. A door that is ajar. Let us emerge from the shadows of the Reaper's decade-long ascendancy. For you and you alone, my dear fellows, have the power to push this door open now!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The auditors in the gallery have no rights to express an opinion on court proceedings! Silence!
</p>
<center>He's right. The judge has absolute authority here.<br />Yes, if he calls the trial to an end, it must end!<br />But will that really do?<br />I sense dark things occurring behind the scenes... Dark things indeed...<br />Is there a single person here present who can honestly say he doesn't sense the same?</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
What... What's...?
</p>
<center>The trial should go on! Summon the witness!<br />
That's right! We need to clear this up before that young Japanese fellow is remanded in custody!</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p>
<center>My Lord! You assured those present that you would uncover the whole truth here!<br />
Vindicate yourself of this outlandish accusation!<br />The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth! That's the very foundation of British law!</center>
<p><br />
Van Zieks:<br />
A toast...to my dependable colleagues in the gallery!
</p>
<center>On with the trial! On with the trial!<br />
Testify! Testify! Testify!</center>
<p><br />
Sholmes:<br />
Well, My Lord? You hear the voice of British justice, I take it? I think you'll find it will be rather awkward to silence.
</p><p>Stronghart:
</p>
<center>.........</center>
<p>The court will recess briefly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I have no intention of shrinking from these allegations.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Bailiff! Arrange for the subpoena of the witness at once! As soon as the gentleman arrives at the courthouse, we shall reconvene.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
A recess won't be necessary, My Lord.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Pardon?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Mikotoba is a close friend of mine. He accompanied me today and is waiting in the antechamber as we speak. I do believe he's been enjoying a little trip down memory lane, in fact.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What?! Professor Mikotoba is here in the courthouse?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Sholmes, you... You didn't know this would happen, did you?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
My dear fellow, no one is in a better position to answer that question than you, surely.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I wasn't just asking for the fun of it, you know.)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Well, I must thank you for your assistance in this matter... Mr Sholmes. However... ...you are of no further use here. Kindly leave the courtroom at once.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
But of course. In truth, I find myself rather busy now as a result of these developments. Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! ...Yes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I trust you have Iris's little <span style="color:#E16935">lucky charm</span> with you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Absolutely! It's still in my pocket.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
She sends her regards, and a reminder: If you find yourself at a dead end, the ears are at your disposal. ...Just one tug, if you please.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, um...of course!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
In that case, the trial will continue without delay. Bailiff! Show the witness to the stand!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So it's Lord Stronghart... He's the Reaper of the Bailey. Where exactly is this trial going to take me, I wonder? Just how deep am I about to be plunged into the blackness of the abyss? Well...I'm ready. I'm ready to head into the heart of this maelstrom and confront whatever horrors it tries to drown me under!)</span>

<div style="text-align: right;">To be continued...</div>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
So, witness...please state your name and occupation for the court.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Yujin Mikotoba, lecturer in forensic medicine at the Imperial Yumei University in Tokyo, Japan.
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And...Professor Mikotoba, the young lady beside you is...?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Ah, this is Dr Maria Gorey. Scotland Yard's practising coroner. The daughter of Dr Sithe, I understand.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, Dr Sithe...)</span>
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I'm afraid I can't tell you why she's here. She just...appeared.
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
......... You summon this strange Japanese man as a witness to that autopsy... ...but you don't summon Mama. That makes no sense. She was there too.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
...That's about the size of it. I've had her eyes boring into the side of my cheek constantly. Whilst I was in the antechamber, too.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Poor man. The idea of it's making ME shudder...)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The revelations about Dr Sithe that came to light some days ago defiled the reputation of the entire judiciary. She was therefore deemed unfit to appear as a witness in today's proceedings. The Ministry of Justice's decision on that is final.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Well, we wouldn't want any more <span style="color:#E16935">perjury</span> to be committed, would we?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The Ministry of Justice? Some questionable strings are being pulled, I think...)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I remember you...Dr Mikotoba. But I certainly never expected to be meeting you under these circumstances.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Yes, it's been a long while, Lord Stronghart.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The prosecution understands that you were a visiting student of forensic science in London until ten years ago.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
That's right. I studied under Dr Wilson at St Synner's.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So you were present at the autopsy of my brother, Lord Klint van Zieks?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I was, yes. I assisted Dr Wilson with the entire procedure.
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
...Tsk. Mama is far more skilled than any Japanese man.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well, Dr Wilson asked me to be his primary assistant on that occasion.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And this autopsy report was actually penned by you, I believe?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Yes. I noted all of the doctor's findings and when we were done, he read through the document and signed it.
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
Poor Mama... As secondary assistant, she wouldn't have had such a good view of all the innards.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So, Professor...do you remember Inspector Gregson?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Yes, of course. If it wasn't for his insistence, Lord van Zieks's autopsy would never have happened. But he was absolutely convinced that it would reveal decisive evidence against Genshin, you see. So Lord Stronghart had to entreat the nobility to allow it to take place. Do correct me if I'm wrong, My Lord.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...It was a result of that autopsy that a mass murderer was apprehended and justice was done.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
But Gregson admitted it before he was killed! He admitted that the results of the autopsy were <span style="color:#E16935">fabricated</span>!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You were there at the time. So you must testify! You have an obligation to tell the truth about what really went on!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Absolutely. That's precisely why I'm here.
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
And that's why I'm here, too!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Very well, then. You will give your formal testimony now, witness. But before you begin, a word of warning:
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
...Oh?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
You will state truthfully and accurately what you saw and what you heard at the time.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
...I wouldn't dream of doing otherwise, My Lord.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The moment your testimony verges on supposition, I will expel you from my courtroom. Remember that.

<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span><br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- The Autopsy of Klint van Zieks -</span></center>
<p>Mikotoba:<br />
From my own observations, I couldn't say there was any indication of the autopsy results having been fabricated.<br />
Death resulted from a wound made by a Western-style sword transfixing the heart. That I found a little strange.
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
There were no other signs of internal injury. Nothing questionable at all.<br />
It was just that beautiful but dangerous piece of evidence removed from the man's stomach.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Presumed to have been swallowed by the victim as a way of posthumously identifying his assailant.

No indication...? NOTHING to suggest fabrication?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Professor Mikotoba! Are you certain about that?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well, nothing that I could positively identify as such, much less swear to in testimony.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Heh heh heh... Hah hah hah hah hah hah haaah! Well, that clears things up nicely! The only fabrication here, Asogi...has come from you.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
You claim the inspector confessed just before his death. But that...THAT is the fabrication!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
No! He freely acknowledged it! I swear he did!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Freely? With the tip of a sword at his throat? The man was clearly at his <span style="color:#E16935">wits' end</span>.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The court will give no credence to this 'confession' that was uttered in obvious desperation. Quite simply, there was nothing questionable about the investigation of Lord Klint van Zieks's death. And with this testimony we have, without question, uncovered the whole truth of the matter!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
If I may, My Lord... ...there was most certainly <span style="color:#E16935">something questionable</span> about it. And the whole truth does rather elude us, I feel.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I beg your pardon.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well, you're obviously aware of the facts of the case. All four of the Professor's previous victims... ...died when an enormous beast was set upon them that ripped out their throats.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, such horrifying crimes...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
But curiously, the killer's last victim, Lord Klint van Zieks, suffered a different fate.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, you're right...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
He was stabbed through the heart with a sword...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
That's enough.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I believe I warned you about this, witness. I promised to curtail your testimony as soon as it entered the realms of supposition or speculation.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Hmph.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Very well, My Lord. In that case the defence will pursue a conclusion to this during the cross-examination.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I have the right to cross-examine every witness after testimony. And I fully intend to exercise that right!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ryunosuke...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm afraid that even the presiding judge... ...has no authority to contravene the letter of the law. As I'm sure every member of the judiciary present in the gallery would agree!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...Hmph! Very well. You may begin, Counsel. However, the moment your argument strays from the established facts... ...I will not hesitate to bring the cross-examination to an end. Proceed with caution.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord!

No, sadly not.

But then you couldn't say there wasn't any indication, either...could you?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
......... No, true, I couldn't. I was at Dr Wilson's side as he performed the procedure, recording what he did. But at times of course, he instructed me to fetch implements and suchlike. Whilst I was away from the operating table, obviously I could have missed something.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And at those times, what was the secondary assistant doing?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
...Following this Japanese man's orders to adjust the lighting or pass him implements. But that doesn't mean Mama wasn't a vital part of the team!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Q-Quite, yes. So would you kindly refrain from starting at my cheek like that?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Professor Mikotoba, think! Was there nothing at all that seemed out of place to you?

Well...yes, there was, as a matter of fact.

In all of the previous four killings attributed to the Professor... ...the victims were killed by an enormous dog, I believe? Their throats were, well...mauled?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Correct. And yet Lord van Zieks was stabbed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! Do, do you mean to say... ...you think Lord Klint van Zieks may not in fact have been one of the Professor's victims?!

There is no basis on which to doubt the findings of the investigations carried out at the time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Genshin Asogi confessed to all of his crimes upon his arrest. He admitted to having taken the lives of all five members of the aristocracy.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Argh!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Yet the beast that was used to carry out the killings was never identified. No evidence was found to suggest that Genshin had ever kept a dog.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What exactly was it, though? What does 'beautiful but dangerous' mean?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
Well... ...it was sparkly and round, with a hole...as if it might slip over a finger perhaps.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
It was <span style="color:#E15935">a ring</span>. Belonging to Genshin Asogi.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
M-My father's ring...was inside the victim's stomach?!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
At the time, Genshin wore a large ring on the digitus quartus of his left hand - the fourth or 'ring' finger. I'd understood it was some sort of keepsake.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
When my father left Japan for London sixteen years ago, I was eight years old. But I remember that ring.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You do?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
My father's possessions were sent to our family home in Japan after his death, but the ring wasn't among them.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Obviously not. It was a key piece of evidence. It remains under lock and key in the stores at Scotland Yard to this day.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
After the autopsy, Genshin was summoned by the police to check for the presence of his ring. It wasn't on his hand of course. Moreover...there were <span style="color:#E16935">deep abrasions</span> on his finger where it had been pulled off.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
...They arrested the man there and then, right before my eyes.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
How could they?!
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
I brought the ring along with me today.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
Here it is. A bit dusty from years in the stores.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Good gracious! Yes, that's it. I haven't seen that in ten long years...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And...that was found inside the victim's stomach?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
......... I... Yes, I'm afraid so.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You hesitated there, Professor Mikotoba. ...Should we read something into that?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Ah, well... It's just that thinking back now... ...I <span style="color:#E16935">didn't actually witness</span> the moment it was extracted from the victim's body.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my! Really?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
At that precise moment, Dr Wilson had asked me to fetch him a new scalpel, you see.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Dr Gorey... ...the removal of historic evidence from the stores requires my consent, does it not?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
However it came to be here, the court cannot deny that this is crucial evidence for today's proceedings.

He must have ripped the ring from Genshin's finger with his teeth... ...before swallowing it to keep it from being retrieved. ...That was the prevailing hypothesis at the time.

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Supposition at best! What possible evidence do you have to support such a rash claim?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This evidence...right here.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
That's the autopsy report!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
It's explicit in that report, Counsel. Other than the ring, nothing unusual was noted internally. So I'm not sure how you intend to prove your point.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You've already done it for me, My Lord. The lack of internal injury says it all.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
To swallow a ring of this size would require considerable effort and determination. And in addition to its size, there are the sharp claws around the gemstone to contend with.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My brother was a determined man. And on the brink of death, even more so, I'm sure. He would have stopped at nothing to ensure that evil killer was brought to justice.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But if he really had swallowed that enormous ring... ...it's inconceivable that no <span style="color:#E16935">traces</span> of its passage down his throat would have remained as internal trauma!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
No!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
......... And there you've arrived at the sticking point. That's precisely why I <span style="color:#E16935">had my doubts</span> about the findings myself ten years ago.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Then why didn't you say something at the time?!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I did. I still remember the conversation I had with Dr Wilson in the laboratory that day.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Wilson:<br />
Look at this! Now this is a very curious thing to find in a man's stomach, wouldn't you say?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
But...isn't that rather peculiar, Dr Wilson?
</p><p>Wilson:<br />
What's that now, Mikotoba?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well, if he swallowed a ring of that size, with those sharp metal claws that it has... ...surely you'd expect to see damage to the throat and oesophagus? Torn mucous membranes at the very least.
</p><p>Wilson:<br />
.......... Doctor Mikotoba, may I remind you... ...that I have vastly more experience than you.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I'm, I'm terribly sorry.
</p><p>Wilson:<br />
I can think of plenty of ways to explain why no injuries would be seen. No, let's say this: 'The victim would appear to have ingested the item as evidence to identify his assailant.' Go ahead! Write it down!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
So I was right! Dr Wilson deliberately fabricated the results of the autopsy to implicate my father!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I'm disappointed, Counsel. That argument is nothing more than speculation.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Dr Wilson was Britain's leading authority on forensic science and autopsy work. There is no scientific basis on which to doubt the man's expert opinion.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Pardon the interruption, My Lord, but... ...damage to the mucous membranes of the throat is easily identified even in living subjects.
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
Using a device called an 'endoscope', recently demonstrated in practical use in France. I want one! ...The government can pay.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I don't think so! And Dr Gorey... ...rest assured that your removal of evidence from the stores without permission will not go unpunished.
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
......... We open up the dead to find the truth.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I beg your pardon?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
But Mama... She chose to stitch her corpses up...with all her secrets inside... ......... That's wrong.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Dr Gorey... <span style="color:#0070C0">(It's looking as though... ...she's chosen to walk a different path to her 'mama'.)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Yes...the ring.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What about the ring?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I've just remembered something. An earlier incident.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What incident?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The one I recounted to you before. About a memory I have... ...of Genshin Asogi saving my life.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What?! My, my father...saved YOUR life?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
It was ten years ago, on a foggy night. Genshin and I were walking down some back streets at a late hour. All of a sudden...
</p>
<hr />
<center>Don't make a peep! You're comin' with us!</center>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
All of our assailants were armed with pistols, their faces obscured by scarves.
</p>
<hr />
<center>*Bang!*</center>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
The next thing I knew, there was silence all around. Genshin lay on the cobbled street. Blood was seeping from his left hand. He'd shielded me.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
It was on the ring finger of his <span style="color:#E16935">left hand</span> that he used to wear that ring.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! Are, are you saying...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I've always believed those thugs were after me. But now I'm starting to question if perhaps I wasn't the intended target after all...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
W-Wait, but...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Genshin was arrested two days after that attack. And in that short interval, the decisive evidence needed to indict him was miraculously found.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You mean...the ring was stolen from him?! You think that's what those thugs were after that night?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... You... You pathetic coward... You expect me to believe that you weren't involved?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It was you, wasn't it? You're the one who took it. You stole my father's ring! You set the whole thing up so you could paint him as a mass murderer and have him arrest-
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Kazuma... ...open your eyes.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
R-Ryunosuke?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You must know deep down... The truth can be completely obscured even when your judgement is only slightly clouded. But at the moment...you seem to be floundering through a dense fog.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Is that why you were so insistent I should be present in this trial? To see you like this?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Heh heh heh... Well, this is an amusing spectacle. What a grandiose expression on your face! As if you were Lady Justice herself.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
It seems that you've thoroughly convinced yourself of this alleged fabrication of the autopsy results. So much so that you're apparently blind to the blatant <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span> that would be born out of it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Though it's extremely hard to believe, let us imagine that there was some misconduct during the autopsy. If that were the case...why would Asogi not have disputed the findings in his trial?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
In the closed court hearing ten years ago, the defendant never once denied the claims against him. ...Isn't that right, Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Yes, that is indeed correct. Upon hearing the verdict of 'guilty', he merely closed his eyes, quietly accepting the judgement. The actions of a man who has accepted responsibility for his deeds and is resigned to his fate.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but then...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my... That is very strange. If Mr Asogi did nothing to oppose the charges against him, then... ...that would surely mean there was <span style="color:#E16935">no fabricated evidence</span>!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
An obvious conclusion at which you should have arrived many minutes ago...Prosecutor Asogi. Your twisted loyalty and clouded judgement are hampering your ability for logical thought.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Argh!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Genshin Asogi's silence at his hearing can mean only one thing: There was no fabrication of evidence during the autopsy of his final victim ten years ago!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! <span style="color:#0070C0">(But if that autopsy was all above board... ...there'll be nothing to stop Lord Stronghart bringing this trial to an immediate conclusion!)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Thank you, Ryunosuke. If it wasn't for your frank words just now... ...this trial may very well have ended prematurely.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
K-Kazuma...?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
What's this latest absurdity, Counsel?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
My Lord... ...your reasoning is perfectly sound...but for one, giant hole!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I beg your pardon?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You claim my father's silence was due to the fact that there was <span style="color:#E16935">no fabricated evidence</span>. But there's another possible explanation. You've overlooked the possibility that he had <span style="color:#E16935">a reason</span> for maintaining that silence!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Silence that would lead to him being convicted and sent to his death? If the autopsy results were an invention, there's no conceivable reason why the man wouldn't have protested!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Oh, those results <span style="color:#E16935">were an invention</span> alright. There's no question of that. Or are you forgetting that two people with a connection to that autopsy have been assassinated?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
If I force the grievances I feel from my mind...I start to see you in <span style="color:#E16935">a very different light</span>. I think perhaps it's you who's been living in delusion these ten years.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
M...Me...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Kazuma-sama has created one last chance for us here, Mr Naruhodo. If we can only show there was a reason for his father's silence in his trial...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A reason why the man would have said nothing even though he was innocent... Could it have been part of some negotiation, perhaps?)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Enough rhetoric! The court must be shown evidence. <span style="color:green">What proof do you have that could possibly explain Asogi's silence in court?</span>

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This is the defence's answer to that question!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
As I indicated before, my patience for rhetoric is growing thin.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You could've at least accompanied that penalty with an explanation of why that answer was wrong...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
If Kazuma-sama's father knew that the evidence being used to convict him was fabricated... ...why would he have said nothing in his trial?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If it were me, I'd have protested my innocence until I was blue in the face.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So if we're right about the autopsy results, there must have been a strong reason for his silence.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well then...perhaps... ...he was saying nothing in exchange for some sort of clemency? Ah! <span style="color:#0070C0">(That could be it!)</span> My Lord! The defence would like to-
</p><p><i>Leads back to:</i><br />
"Enough rhetoric! The court must be shown evidence."
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's true that Genshin Asogi's silence during his trial resulted in his conviction... ...but that didn't actually lead to his execution. On the contrary... ...it led to his escape. An escape that was only possible because he'd been sentenced to death.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Although I find it hard to believe my father would have negotiated in that way...the defence is correct. A fake execution, falsification of a death certificate and a jailbreak inside a coffin... Clearly such an elaborate plan couldn't have been carried out by my father alone.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
He must have had the help of <span style="color:#E16935">a collaborator</span> from the judiciary.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I have here the dismissal notice of the chief warder who was working in the prison at the time. The notes read: 'There are indications that the jailbreak was in planning prior to the inmate's incarceration.' In other words... ...there were suggestions of some sort of negotiation between Mr Asogi and the British government!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
In exchange for his silence in court, he was given an assurance that he would be broken out of prison... Yes, with that sort of clandestine agreement in place, I can imagine he would have kept very quiet.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I would go further than that, in fact. I would say... ...that the elaborate jailbreak of Mr Asogi can be explained in no other way!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Order! Order! First fabricated evidence and now a jailbreak conspiracy?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Of course. Because it's all intimately <span style="color:#E16935">linked</span>.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The prosecution wishes to summon new witnesses to the stand!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Witnesses?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
People who can testify about the jailbreak that took place ten years ago.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Governor Caidin...? And the poor chief warder of the prison!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I won't allow this trial to turn into a farce! To summon the governor of the prison after all these years...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Oh, it wouldn't be any trouble, My Lord.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
What?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Father...?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
My dear friend may appear a little rattlepated at times, but I can assure you he is extremely thorough. He wired both Barclay and the local prison earlier... ...asking Governor Caidin and Mr Vigil to attend the Old Bailey as a matter of extreme urgency.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Sholmes did that?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Are, are you telling me that...?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Both men are, unless I'm much mistaken... ...waiting just outside the courtroom at this very moment.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
My Lord, you must permit this trial to proceed as you declared at its outset. You promised that we would stop at nothing to uncover the whole truth behind these disturbing findings!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... Very well. Bring in the witnesses! Make no mistake: I, too, would like nothing more than to lay this business to rest once and for all!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
Would the new witnesses state their names and occupations for the court, please.
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Aye. Barry Caidin, governor of Barclay Prison.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Everyone calls me Gossip. I sell jaunty little titbits to passers-by, you-
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, your other persona, if you don't mind...
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Oh, I do beg your pardon. Of course...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Vigil:<br />
My name is Daley Vigil. I used to be the chief warder at Barclay Prison.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The reason you've been summoned here to court today... ...is to testify about the jailbreak of the so-called 'Professor' ten years ago.
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Losh! The Professor?! We've already been through all this afore. A decade ago! And the conclusion was that there was'nae anythin' untoward happened.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A convict escaped from your prison, Governor. Hardly what you'd call 'nothing untoward'!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Ah...well...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The convict's death certificate was somehow falsified after he was allegedly executed... ...and he escaped the prison inside his own coffin. A plan of that complexity... ...could never have been carried out without the help of somebody of influence inside the prison.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Governor Caidin, don't imagine that the passage of time will afford you any protection.
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
If it turns out that you were involved in the plot to break Mr Asogi out of your prison, then of course... ...the consequences will be very serious. In all likelihood, a capital punishment.
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Gads! Hold on there, laddie! All I did was-
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Witness! ...Governor Caidin...
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Hm? Ah, aye, SIR!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
You have a critical role to play in the public safety of our country. A great responsibility to shoulder. The significance of your testimony in court cannot be understated. Therefore...think carefully before you speak. And Prosecutor Asogi...if you threaten the witness again, you will be held in contempt of court.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...! My apologies, My Lord.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There's no disputing the fact that an intricate jailbreak plot was enacted ten years ago. Clearly, you were both involved in some way. So you will testify before the court now and explain exactly what took place!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Very well. Let the witnesses give their formal testimony. Tell the court everything you know of the plot to break Asogi out of Barclay ten years ago!

<p>Caidin:<br />
It was the day that Japanese jock was found guilty. The directive came from the Prosecutor's Office.<br />
I assigned the convict to the chief warder Vigil here, and put the plan into action behind the scenes.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
I was responsible for Asogi right up until the night of his execution. But I knew nothing of any plot...
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
I dinnae ken if there were some negotiations between the convict and the Prosecutor's Office.<br />
All I did was carry oot my duty! For Her Majesty's great British Empire!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A directive from the Prosecutor's Office? Are you saying that was the jailbreak plot?!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
...Aye, that's right.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Who sent it?! Who authorised that plan?!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
......... I dinnae ken that.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You're saying you don't know?!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Listen, there was'nae a thing aboot that Professor case that was'nae unusual in some way. I did'nae ask any questions. I just did what I was told to do. More than that, I could'nae tell ya.

But if the jailbreak plan originated from <span style="color:#E16935">the Prosecutor's Office</span>... ...then one thing is very clear: As suspected, there were clandestine dealings going on between Mr Asogi and that office. The jailbreak was promised <span style="color:#E16935">in exchange</span> for Mr Asogi admitting to crimes he didn't commit!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />

Oh! Yes, My Lord?

I fail to see how these witnesses have any more pertinent information here. Do you intend to assert your right to a cross-examination?

Absolutely! I have no intention of squandering a single opportunity, My Lord!

Well, it just doesn't make sense, does it? To make the man admit to crimes he didn't commit with the promise of a jailbreak, only to kill him in the end... That's treachery of the worst kind.

Confessing under oath to murders he didn't commit on a verbal assurance of later being broken out of prison... Genshin Asogi was taking an incredibly risky gamble.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Very true. There was nothing to stop the British breaking their word and executing him behind closed doors anyway. Under normal circumstances, no man would stake his life on a gentleman's agreement like that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which means that Mr Asogi must have had a trump card. Something that guaranteed he wouldn't be betrayed. Some kind of <span style="color:#E16935">weapon</span>!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Havers! The fella could'nae possibly have had anythin' like that!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It turns out that Mr Asogi was hiding his will in his cell at Barclay. Chief Warder Vigil caught him with it one day.

You...you squealed, did ya, ya wee rat! Did I no tell ya to keep that a secret?!
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
You, you can't touch me now!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
GAAARGH!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
When Mr Vigil caught sight of that will through the bars of the convict's cell... ...Mr Asogi pleaded with the warder:
</p>
<hr />
<p>Vigil:<br />
Alright then. But what's on that paper?
</p><p>...A last will and testament. This will is...the only weapon I have left now.
</p>

<p>Caidin:<br />
A weapon...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And after the convict had been killed following the elaborate pretence of the jailbreak... ...that document mysteriously disappeared, didn't it?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
W-Well yes...all the prison warders searched through the belongings in his cell, but... ...that will was just nowhere to be found.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As I understand it, an exhaustive search was made for the document - which became known as the Asogi Papers. Governor Caidin... ...I believe you ordered your prison staff to find it at all costs, didn't you?
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Eh?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Vigil:<br />
But how can that be? Where in his cell? We all searched the place from top to bottom!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Well ya did'nae do a proper job, eh, ya peelie-wally galoot!
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
You, you can't criticise me now!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
I showed it to ya afore, did I no, yon lawyer?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, you did. I have the document here. It's written in Japanese, and reads: 'The Last Will and Testament of Genshin Asogi'.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Which means everything is as it should be.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Not quite, My Lord. You see, there's an undeniable <span style="color:#E16935">inconsistency</span> here.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What?! What inconsistency?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Asogi described this document as the only weapon he had left. And yet this will contains nothing of significance at all. Nothing that would have given the convict any leverage.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Are you suggesting, my learned friend... ...that the last will and testament stored at Barclay Prison all these years... ...is actually <span style="color:#E16935">a fake</span>?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... As has clearly been demonstrated already... ...what went on at Barclay Prison...was far from above board!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
That last vilification by the defence was an affront to the entire British legal system. This absurd notion of a 'weapon' is something for which we have only the former chief warder's word. The man could quite easily be lying. Or at the very least, sorely mistaken.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
What? No! I, I definitely heard him say that! I swear!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Clearly we need to get to the bottom of this. We need to know exactly what happened with these so-called Asogi Papers!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
A waste of time! ...If the will was fake, where is the real document?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And now you're going to do it again. You're ready to brand him a liar and turn your back on him without even letting him defend himself!
</p>
<center>It's clear that Barclay Prison is hiding something.<br />It's clear that the jailbreak was masterminded by somebody in the Prosecutor's Office.<br />It's clear that some illicit negotiations took place.<br />...Is Your Lordship just going to gloss over these obvious and reprehensible facts?!</center>

Stronghart:<br />

</p>
<center>We should hear more from the chief warder.<br />
Have him testify again!<br />The trial must go on! The man's voice must be heard!</center>

Stronghart:<br />
It would seem that a vocal few here are utterly blind to the truth. ...Very well then! Let the witness testify again. Tell the court precisely what you think you saw of the convict's last will and testament!

<p>Vigil:<br />
As the warder responsible for condemned convicts, I attended to Mr Asogi and kept watch over his cell.<br />
The night after he was found guilty in court, he was doing something with that will in his cell!<br />
We turned the cell inside out looking for it after the execution, but to no avail.
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
I only found oot about the Asogi Papers when a directive came tellin' me to impound them.<br />
The document was in the folds of the fella's robe that was left in his cell. A 'kimono', I think it's called.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Vigil:<br />
In his kimono?! That's...that's a lie! We searched every inch of the man's cell. We looked through all his clothes! It can't be true!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Were you no satisfied wi' callin' me a liar the once, eh, ya wee waffinger?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Hah! There's nothing you can do about it now. You don't have any hold over me any more. Other than the hold you like to take on my cravat, of course. Is that what you're going to do, is it? Are you going to give me a good shake again? ...Or are you too scared?
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Little and large... What a double act.)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
We complied with Asogi's will as far as was possible. All of his personal effects were delivered to his family home in Japan. ...As a courtesy to the homeland of the most notorious killer our country has ever seen.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... And we were much obliged. I can confirm that all of my father's belongings arrived safely.
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Aye, and you cannae deny the handwritin' is that of your old man, eh?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...Yes, there's no mistaking that it's my father's brushwork.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Really...?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
And this last will and testament was the man's last 'weapon', was it? I think we can safely assume that the convict was merely prattling...knowing that his end was nigh.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So would that mean that you conversed with Mr Asogi?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Yes, certainly. Though there was precious little time before his execution was due.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
He was remarkably calm, considering his days were very much numbered. In all honesty...he really didn't strike one as a man capable of mass murder.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Yet he confessed in full to the crimes.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
I know. That's why I felt compelled to ask him one day. I can still recall his reply: 'I'm guilty of the unforgivable crime of ending another human's life, yes.'
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
But he was so tranquil and intelligent. It put me in mind of an Eastern holy man.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And what about the will you saw him with? What can you tell us about that?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
......... It was the beginning of all the drama. I remember it very well. Yes...

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And he pleaded with you not to report him, didn't he?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Yes, that's right.
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
And like the bampot y'are, ye did'nae tell me. ...A blatant breach of trust, that was.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
I could see that the man had a noble spirit. I...found myself wanting to treat him accordingly.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But according to what you told us two days ago... ...the convict had been strictly forbidden from having any writing materials whatsoever.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Yes, you're quite right.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! So when exactly was the will penned?
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
That was <span style="color:#E16935">before</span> the man was remanded in Barclay, obviously.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Yes, at the Prosecutor's Office under supervision of the relevant authorities. I personally instructed Asogi to make a will for the benefit of his family in his homeland.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In that case...why was it found in his cell?
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
W-What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, if it was penned at the Prosecutor's Office... ...you would have expected that it would remain there for safekeeping, surely?
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's curious... There doesn't seem to be any obvious explanation for why it was subsequently found in the convict's cell.
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Och, well...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The defence makes an astute point. Well, Governor?
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
......... A prison governor cannae be expected to ken the inner workings of the Prosecutor's Office.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
In that case...Lord Stronghart, perhaps you can shed some light on the matter?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... I'm unable to offer an explanation here and now.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I would have to consult with the notary responsible for the will at the time.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The fact that my father's will was discovered in his cell is clearly <span style="color:#E16935">inconsistent</span> with what was expected! ...I want to know why.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Another inexplicable mystery, then...)</span>

It was the governor who ordered the search for the will, as I understand it. Is that right?

Yes. And when I reported back that we couldn't find it... ...he grabbed me by the cravat and yelled, 'It cannae have disappeared completely!' in my face.
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Aye, well...it's doon to the governor to keep everybody workin' as hard as they should.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I think the governor needs a 'wee' taste of his own medicine, Mr Naruhodo!

...The point is, it was clearly considered a very important document, wasn't it?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
But it proved impossible to find...

Oh! You, you mean...

...The article based on Mr Drebber's experience in Lowgate Cemetery!

...Yes, that was it. The day after I'd read that news, I was summoned to the governor's office. And...that's when the awful accusation was made.

That you'd aided Genshin Asogi to escape from the prison, resulting in your immediate dismissal.

</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Well...yes. I mean, I only caught sight of it for a brief moment, of course. But even by the dim light in the cell, I remember thinking that it was an unusual colour. At the very least, I'm quite sure it wasn't black.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... Witness! Is that really what you saw?!
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Ah! Wha... Siiiiiir!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! Um... Is something wrong, Lord Stronghart?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... I, I apologise. Continue.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What do you make of that, Mr Naruhodo? For Lord Stronghart to be so visibly shaken in that way...
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Och, dinnae haver! You can plainly see the writin' here. And it's as black as the Earl o' Hell's waistcoat!
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Well...yes, you're right...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Vigil, I'd like to confirm one point with you. Did you actually see <span style="color:#E16935">the content</span> of the document that Mr Asogi was holding that night?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Oh! Well, no! I mean, there was no time. As soon as he noticed me there, he hid it behind his back.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But it was definitely a will, was it?
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Yes, it was. That's what Mr Asogi told me.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The court need waste no further time on this matter. We have the will in question in our possession. There is nothing more to add.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A will written in <span style="color:#E16935">scarlet</span> ink... What did Mr Vigil really see Kazuma's father holding, I wonder...?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
If you have an inkling, Mr Naruhodo, you must present it to the court at once!

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That testimony doesn't give much away.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So this will really was penned by Kazuma-sama's father. I wonder what he could possibly have meant when he described it as a weapon...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's starting to sound very much like Mr Asogi actually had <span style="color:#E16935">nothing</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But the plan to break him out of jail went ahead. Which means he must have had some bargaining power. He must have been hiding something. It's the only explanation that makes sense.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's...starting to sound like Mr Asogi actually might have had <span style="color:#E16935">something</span>!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Which is it, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm not sure. But I feel as though I'm on the brink of understanding all this. Let's listen to all the information again and see what more we can learn. We can't overlook even the smallest detail!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Absolutely!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Scarlet-coloured writing is what you said you thought you saw, Mr Vigil. And I believe that's exactly what you did see.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Wha...?
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Havers again! You've no evidence to say that!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Have a look at this report.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
That's...my brother's autopsy report!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. And there's something in here that's bothered me since I first read it. It states that <span style="color:#E16935">scarlet-coloured</span> ink stains were noted on the fingers of the victim's right hand.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Yes, so it does.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
S-Scarlet ink...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Now, I'm not familiar with the habits of the British aristocracy, I freely admit. But I would hazard a guess that they don't all go around with ink stains on their fingertips, do they?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Your wit is not appreciated. My brother was a well-bred and fastidious man. Should ink have sullied his fingertips, he would have cleaned them immediately!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...What is your point, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My point is this! Whatever Lord Klint van Zieks was writing in that unusually coloured ink... ...it must have been directly before his death. Because he died before he had the opportunity to clean his hand.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
What...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... I remember something troubled me at the time. At the scene, the lid of my brother's inkwell was <span style="color:#E16935">open</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But Klint was punctilious about such things. It seemed...unusual. And no document penned in the colour of the ink that was in the inkwell was ever found.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So the document had <span style="color:#E16935">disappeared</span>... Are you suggesting... ...that the document my father had in his hand that night in his cell was...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The same document that Lord Klint van Zieks was writing <span style="color:#E16935">moments before his death</span>.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Then...it was...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If Mr Vigil's testimony is to be believed, it can only mean that, yes. Mr Vigil!
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Siiiiiir!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
When you spotted Mr Asogi with the document in his cell... ...his precise words were as follows, were they not?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Vigil:<br />
Alright then. But what's on that paper?
</p><p>...A last will and testament. This will is...the only weapon I have left now.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
A, a last will and testament...
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Aaah...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If the conversation really did go as Mr Vigil says... ...then what we now know completely changes the meaning of what Mr Asogi said.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... You really think...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Vigil did indeed see the convict with a will. But it wasn't that of Genshin Asogi. It was the last will and testament of Lord Klint van Zieks!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
No...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
WHAAAT?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093328" class="image"><img alt="Objection van Zieks English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection van Zieks English.png" data-image-key="Objection_van_Zieks_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/b/b1/Objection_van_Zieks_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093328" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
This...this is madness! My brother's last will and testament? That would mean...that he had chosen to die!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That...is what it would mean, yes.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
No! Impossible! That is utterly out of the question!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Lord van Zieks...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Klint was pursuing the Professor. It consumed him day and night. Whatever happened, he would never have abandoned his investigation before its conclusion. Never! He wouldn't rest until the job was done... Until the killer was caught... The idea that he would willingly accept his own death... It's obscene!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And yet we can be sure that he was writing his will moments before his death.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And that Genshin Asogi came to be in possession of that document. So what could the will possibly have contained...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Clearly something that couldn't be made public under any circumstances whatsoever. Because armed with that document, my father was able to negotiate with the judiciary for his life. It was something so damning that it prompted the powers that be to enact that daring jailbreak plot. Yes, there can be no question that the will contained <span style="color:#E16935">information of the utmost secrecy</span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Information...of the utmost <span style="color:#E16935">secrecy</span>... AAAAAAH! <span style="color:#0070C0">(No... It, it couldn't be...)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I've heard more than enough. Pursuing this notion of a phantom will nobody can attest to having seen serves absolutely no purpose.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
No, My Lord, that's unacceptable!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
What did you say, Counsel?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The last will and testament that Genshin Asogi had in his possession was that of Lord Klint van Zieks. All the testimony and evidence presented to the court has logically led us to that as a possibility. We have a duty...to pursue the line of reasoning to its conclusion!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
But with no possible means of knowing the contents of the document, there is no line of reasoning to pursue!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(<span style="color:#E16935">A reason</span> why Lord Klint van Zieks, a man of high noble standing, would have chosen death... <span style="color:#E16935">Information so secret</span>, people in the judiciary would be willing to negotiate the jailbreak of a condemned killer... The only explanation that fits those facts... is an unthinkable <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> that turns absolutely everything <span style="color:#E16935">on its head</span>! But...it's just too hideous...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
However difficult the situation might become... ...you work with your client in pursuit of the truth. That's what you resolved to do when you entered the courtroom this morning, if I'm not mistaken.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Susato...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So hold your head high and keep soldiering on!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Yes, you're right. Ten years ago, in his final moments, Lord Klint van Zieks left behind a will. A will that Genshin Asogi was able to use as <span style="color:#E16935">a weapon</span> to negotiate his escape from prison. In all probability, the details in the will were related to the Professor case.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The defence's last statement is mere conjecture.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What are you getting at, man?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ryunosuke?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(As soon as these words come out of my mouth, there's no going back...)</span> <span style="color:green">I believe that the last will and testament of Lord Klint van Zieks was in fact...</span>

My brother had no outstanding business.

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Enough! ...Counsel. What are you saying? Do you even realise?! A confession...about the true identity of the Professor... That, that would mean... .........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Lord van Zieks, I appreciate this must be hard to take in... ...but it's the only explanation that fits!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The killer that terrorised London a decade ago, and became known as the Professor... The man believed to have murdered five members of the aristocracy... ...wasn't Genshin Asogi at all.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...! No... You can't be suggesting...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was in fact the man believed to have been <span style="color:#E16935">the fifth victim</span>... ...Lord Klint van Zieks himself!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Grrrrrr......... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...It's finally open, is it? Pandora's box...
</p>
<center>The great van Zieks family... They've been <span style="color:#E16935">thoroughbreds</span> of the British judiciary for years...<br />And Lord Klint van Zieks! He was <span style="color:#E16935">a paragon of justice</span> in the capital...<br />But he was actually <span style="color:#E16935">a mass murderer</span>? A, a perpetrator of atrocities of the vilest nature...<br />If the general public ever found out... law and order in this country would be finished!</center>
<p><br />
Van Zieks:<br />
......... My... My brother...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, this is too awful... Poor Lord van Zieks...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I wonder, though... Did he never suspect?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Lord Barok van Zieks is a brilliant prosecutor. Is it conceivable that he didn't realise what his older brother really was...?)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Order! Order! Order in court!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Lord van Zieks...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The Professor made use of an enormous hound as his 'murder weapon'. Tell me...did your brother own a dog?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Yes. He did. Balmung. He was a well known hunting dog. People called him a giant.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I don't believe this...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
When my brother would go hunting in the forest of the grounds behind the house, he always took Balmung. After Klint's death, the creature passed away too... almost as if he were following his master. He was a magnificent hunting dog...worthy of the jewel-studded collar around his neck.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A jewel-studded collar...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
That's right. Though sadly... ...some years ago now it was stolen by a thief who broke into the house one night.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A jewel-studded collar, stolen by a thief...)</span> It so happens, that myself and my colleagues have come across such a collar during our time in London.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...How could you...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There was an old <span style="color:#E16935">emblem</span> attached to the collar, too, made of pure gold. It was topped with a small crown and bore an ornate capital letter 'B'...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
W-What?! An emblem bearing the initial 'B'?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my! You know it?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...It's the insignia of the <span style="color:#E16935">Baskerville</span> family.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
WHAT?! The Baskerville... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Why is THAT name coming up now...?)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Baskerville is the family name of my late brother's widow. That pure gold emblem was an heirloom, which Klint acquired upon their marriage. There can be no doubt then. The collar you've described was Balmung's.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The family insignia of Lord Klint van Zieks's widow...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There was a considerable amount of <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span> on the collar when we saw it. Since we know the dog was used for hunting, it could have been from its quarry, of course.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
But it could equally have been from <span style="color:#E16935">human</span> prey.
</p>
<center>So is it true then...?<br />Klint van Zieks really was the Professor...<br />Impossible! These Japanese are making it all up to exonerate their own!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
So in fact, the person responsible for these murders of nobles and royals was a noble himself. And that threatened to be an enormous scandal that would irrevocably destabilise British society.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
My father knew that, and was using it to negotiate his way out of the unjust charges brought against him. But at the very last hour, those he'd bargained with betrayed him...slaying him mercilessly on foreign soil.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

Well? Can you deny it...Lord Stronghart?!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... Ten years have passed. And still now, the six million inhabitants of our great capital rest easy believing that justice was done. That though his anonymity remains, the diabolical murderer was caught and executed. ......... Very well then. ...You may have the truth.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Tell me then! Tell me what Klint really was!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... Lord Klint van Zieks was too pure of heart. When he became a prosecutor and went in pursuit of the black roots of crime, he drove himself into a corner. He came to the uncomfortable realisation... ...that to fight the most fiendish of criminals requires one to become even more fiendish oneself.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........K-Klint...
</p>
<center>The 19th century was a truly miraculous hundred years for Great Britain...and indeed the whole world. New industry, new technology, and with the birth of the Metropolitan Police Service, new law and order. But these dazzling new developments meant ever deeper shadows were cast on society. Water sullied by factories, air thick with noxious fumes and crime...growing daily to fill the darkness. Lord Klint van Zieks made it his mission to combat that darkness. But as time went on, it slowly ate at his soul, until eventually...he was consumed.</center>
<p><br />
Stronghart:<br />
It's ironic, really - and somewhat surprising - that the truth has once again been unearthed... ...by a Japanese.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Once again? What do you mean?!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Ten years ago, your father, Genshin Asogi, turned up at my office one night...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Stronghart:<br />
The Professor?!
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
Yes, beyond all shadow of doubt. You must issue a warrant to search his home at once!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...Don't be absurd. The man comes from one of our country's most illustrious families. He's a paragon of justice here in the capital.
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
Yes, that's the point! That's why none of you British can see it! He's using his noble status as a diversion whilst he commits these atrocious crimes behind the scenes!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...Do you have evidence?
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
......... Nothing definitive as yet. But he keeps an enormous, savage hound on the estate. We need the full support of the judiciary for this! We're up against a member of the aristocracy!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...So a large family estate has a fierce guard dog. You should know that's commonplace here in Britain. I'm sorry, but I can't possibly put Scotland Yard onto this based on the tenuous accusation of a visiting student.
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
...!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Stronghart:<br />
So I turned down Asogi's plea. And as a result...he took it upon himself to visit the van Zieks mansion on his own. We can only imagine now what happened between the two men. Though we know the outcome of course: Lord Klint van Zieks perished.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I don't believe this...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
So, in actual fact...Kazuma-sama's father did...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He made the late Lord van Zieks meet <span style="color:#E16935">the same fate</span>... <span style="color:#0070C0">(He put a permanent end to the Professor killings... ...by taking the drastic measure of <span style="color:#E16935">ending the perpetrator's life</span>!)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
As soon as I heard, I hurried to the mansion. When I arrived, it was easy to grasp what had happened.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And? What about the will?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Asogi must have already taken it. Nothing of that nature was found at the scene. We had no idea of the existence of such a document at that time. I was the only person who knew of the true identity of the Professor. So...I resolved to keep it a secret and to guard the secret to the bitter end.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
S-So you're admitting to it? That...you were behind it all?!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
It was you, then, who pinned the crimes on my father!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...I did what needed to be done in order to protect the law and order of the British Empire. Even if that meant employing an unforgivable ruse.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then it was you who arranged this fabricated evidence!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I ordered that detective to take care of it. Whilst keeping the truth from him, naturally.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Gregson...?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Obviously, he opposed me at first.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gregson:<br />
Are you off your rocker?! We can't do somethin' like that!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
There's no question that it was Asogi who murdered Lord van Zieks. The house staff have made statements that they saw the man running from the mansion that night.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes, well...I've no doubt it was that Japanese fella. But we haven't got a shred of conclusive evidence against the man! And worse than that, he doesn't keep a dog. So we're short of a murder weapon to boot!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
And we're short on time, Gregson!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
We must put a stop to this man's rampage! For the good of the country! So we'll use whatever means necessary. ...Do I make myself clear, detective?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
...Blimey...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
So that night ten years ago...when I was attacked by those thugs in the back streets... ...and Genshin's ring was taken. That was him, was it? That was Gregson and some 'hired help'?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Then the detective handed the stolen ring to Dr Wilson... ...who feigned its discovery from the victim's stomach during that autopsy.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And in the light of that 'decisive' evidence, Mr Asogi was found guilty of the charges brought against him. However, behind the scenes... ...he had actually already struck <span style="color:#E16935">a deal</span> with his accusers... ...in which he agreed to silently accept the charges.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
But I just don't believe that part. As far as I knew the man, my father despised such underhand dealings.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...It was extremely easy to make him comply. You see, he had one crippling <span style="color:#E16935">weakness</span>.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
W-What weakness?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Isn't it obvious? You...Kazuma Asogi.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
M-Me?!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p>
<hr />
<p>Stronghart:<br />
...Perhaps you have no desire to return to your homeland, Asogi.
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
What?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Though I hear you have a fourteen-year-old son. Agree to cooperate and accept your guilt without contention... ...and you will see Japan - and your son - again.
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
You...you scoundrel!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Whether you choose wisely or not... ...it will be a closed trial, by order of Her Majesty. So whatever rash claims you might make in court, we'll have no trouble in stifling them. There's only one outcome for you, Asogi: the gallows.
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
Don't forget that I still have a weapon at my disposal. A document revealing <span style="color:#E16935">a truth</span> that I know you're desperate to keep hidden.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Yes, it hadn't escaped my mind. Which is the only reason I'm willing to bargain with you. I only want to protect this country's law and order, you understand. So...what's it to be, Asogi?
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
......... ...Ka.........Kazuma... .........
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
He...he did it for me...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
And as I told him at the time, my motive was simply to protect Britain from the damage the truth would do. To protect this country's law and order...at any cost.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I've never dared let myself even consider this possibility until now... ...but in the light of all this...treachery, I have to ask: <span style="color:#E16935">The mastermind</span> behind the Reaper of the Bailey... Was it you...Lord Mael Stronghart?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... A rather brilliant idea, wouldn't you say... Lord Barok van Zieks?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
That the spirit of your late brother - that paragon of justice - should return to reap justice for his sibling. Could there be a more appetising tale for London's masses, I ask you?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What...what brazen...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I knew that you'd play the part to perfection. But your role really wasn't that of some embodiment of Death. No, you were London's guardian angel.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
An angel with bloody hands? I think not.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Those who had cooperated with me already were only too happy to participate in my plan. Inspector Gregson...Dr Wilson... My minions worked tirelessly to ensure that the finger of guilt could never come to rest on you. It's all thanks to them that you were exalted as the demigod the Reaper became.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
But Dr Wilson left Britain four years ago when he was invited to work in Japan.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
That's right. So I had to employ the services of his young <span style="color:#E16935">protégée</span> after that. Dr Courtney Sithe.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Dr Sithe...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
So what with the execution of the Professor and the subsequent reign of the Reaper of the Bailey... ...I've successfully safeguarded law and order in our mighty capital for the past decade. That...is everything.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
My lords, ladies and gentlemen...I do hereby confess. It was I who sired the concept of the Reaper. However...let me say in my defence... ...it was all for the preservation of law and order across the entire empire!
</p>
<center>Lord Stronghart did it...?<br />An unforgivable collection of crimes! But still...<br />All those who died at the Reaper's hand were rotten to the core anyway...<br />If it was all in aid of keeping London safe...</center>
<p><br />
Stronghart:<br />
There is no one left now who can reveal the precise truth of what happened ten years ago. Therefore, this trial can go no further. Now, I would like to entreat all those present... Beyond these four walls, nobody need know the truth. Even Her Majesty must be protected from this. I trust you all appreciate the importance of my request. It is of course for the good of the country.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Can, can he do this? Can the trial really end now?)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... I have one last question... ...for the accused, Lord van Zieks.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Of course, I know that you're a highly accomplished prosecutor. So I find it hard to believe...that you didn't have any <span style="color:#E16935">doubts</span> at all. That you never suspected your older brother.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, the same thought occurred to me.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... It was only once, but...yes. I couldn't say that I never had my doubts.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My brother's sense of justice was extremely strong. Perhaps...too strong, I observed. At that time, there were members of the aristocracy who were bleeding the country dry for their own gain. And since they were nobles, they were untouchable. For my brother, it was a source of great turmoil.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
And coincidentally at the same time, the Professor began his terrifying reign.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
During the time of the Professor killings, my brother did not appear to be himself.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And that made you suspect?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Yes. But it was <span style="color:#E16935">only once</span>. Not more.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Only once? Really?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Klint wasn't the culprit. That was my conclusion at the time. And I still believe that now.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Do you have any evidence to support that idea?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The third victim...was the Lord Chief Justice at the time. It was he who had recognised my brother's potential and trained him as a prosecutor. No matter what the circumstances, it's unthinkable that my brother could have killed his friend and mentor!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...That will do.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Neither Klint van Zieks nor Genshin Asogi still walk this earth. However much we debate this matter now, we cannot hope to reach a conclusion.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
B-But...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
There are only two extant pieces of evidence from the time: The woebegone ring that acted as the incriminating evidence to condemn Genshin Asogi. And the three-paged last will and testament penned in black ink and left behind by the man. The wretched truth of what happened is exactly as I have explained. Later today, I will present myself at the Ministry of Justice for whatever sanction is deemed appropriate. That is all. Court is adjourned!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Thank you...Kazuma.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Me...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have made this eleventh-hour discovery.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
What discovery?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
My Lord! I'm afraid...I must insist the trial continues!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I beg your pardon?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
As the court has been reminded today already: we must stop at nothing to uncover the whole truth. And to that end, one particular statement made by somebody in this courtroom moments ago... ...revealed a very subtle <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span>.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
What contradiction?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
But...all I did was ask the accused one simple question!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, it began with Lord van Zieks and his recollection about his brother. But Lord Stronghart didn't permit the defendant to speak at length.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I merely pointed out that we can draw no further useful conclusions here. So where on earth is the contradiction?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(One of them definitely just said something contradictory. It's time to identify who!)</span>

This here is the will left behind by Mr Asogi. The <span style="color:#E16935">two-paged</span> will.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yet moments ago, your precise words were: 'The <span style="color:#E16935">three-paged</span> last will and testament.'
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Could it be that originally... ...there was <span style="color:#E16935">a third page</span>?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... For a moment...I thought perhaps you'd identified something worthwhile. But it's a mere trifle, I see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A trifle?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Governor Caidin!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Eh...? W-What can I do for you, SIIIIIIR?!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
You were present when the Japanese man penned his last will and testament.
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Aye! I was there, for sure! I remember the black, werum-like scrawls to this day! And... ...I'm quite certain, My Lord...that there was <span style="color:#E16935">a third page</span> at the time!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Wha... WHAT?!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Only the first two pages were the actual will, though. If I mind correctly, the third...was <span style="color:#E16935">a message</span> to his lad back in Japan.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
For legal purposes, we required only his will.
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
And we would'nae have wanted any...uncomfortable words aboot Britain to get back to Japan, eh. So it was decided that the third page ought'nae to be sent.

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The prosecution agrees. The court should know the content of that message! Every possible piece of evidence must be thoroughly examined!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Very well, then. Governor Caidin... ...you will read the third page of the document for all present to hear!
</p><p>Caidin:<br />
Yes, SIIIIIIR! Only...I should point oot, My Lord... ...that I cannae actually read werum language.

If I could be of assistance here...? I would be happy to translate the words into English for the court.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Father!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... You're still here, are you, Dr Mikotoba?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Naturally. I consider myself a member of the judiciary... albeit a lowly one. But perhaps I should quietly withdraw after I've translated Genshin's message.

<p>'Kazuma... The truth is shrouded in darkness. A darkness only our clan's great sword can pierce. Mighty Karuma, Twist thy head and watch them fall, All thy mortal foes!'

...That's the end of the message, it would seem.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A haiku poem? Twist thy head...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Father...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
What is 'Karuma'?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
The name of the Asogi clan's famous sword. A razor-sharp blade known to all, passed down for generations. It embodies the Japanese spirit.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...It's not known to me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's the 'katana' sword that was submitted as evidence earlier in these proceedings. The one worn by the prosecution counsel when he... confronted Inspector Gregson.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The details of the Asogi Papers have been updated in the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
All these procrastinations are beginning to try my patience. Adjournment of this court is long overdue. As the presiding judge, I have been as accommodating as possible of the will of the courtroom. However, despite all that...no new information has come to light.

Oh...

I once studied the history and development of the katana some time ago... ...and as I'm sure you're probably aware, the sword's 'head' is the part at the very end of the hilt. It's written as 'head' in Japanese, but it's pronounced as '<span style="color:#E16935">kashira</span>' I believe.

Everything that's happened...comes back to this will. This document... ...is the key that will unlock the entire mystery!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Grrrrrr... GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My, my brother's last will and testament... Where did you find that?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It was rolled up inside this.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I-Inside Karuma?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That ultimate weapon Genshin Asogi obtained has lain undisturbed in the hilt of this sword all these years... ...just waiting for the right time to emerge...and reveal the truth!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
The signature and seal certainly look official.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... My God, it's true... It's my brother's handwriting! There can be no mistake!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I forbid the contents of that document from being read out! Do you hear me? I strictly forbid it!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You can't do that, My Lord. This document could explain everything!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
That document could literally destroy the meaning of justice in this country! I demand that you hand it to me...AT ONCE!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Why? What are you trying to hide?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Do that, My Lord... ...and you'll suffer a fatal blow as Lord Chief Justice.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I beg your pardon?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Forcibly ending a trial without good reason? And not any trial. A closed trial by order of Her Majesty the Queen. To defy the monarch's will is treason!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Grrrrrr...
</p>
<center>Lord Klint van Zieks really did pen a will that day...<br />It's exactly as the young Japanese man said!<br />Read it out! Now!<br />We have a right to hear what's in that will! A right...and a duty!</center>
<p><br />
Mikotoba:<br />
Well well, My Lord... ...it would rather appear as though proceedings aren't going to go quite as you'd hoped.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
You... You fools...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Go ahead, Ryunosuke. Read it! The prosecution...gives its full support!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Very well then...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
No... For God's sake... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
</p>
<hr />
<center>'I pen this, my last will and testament, in the final moments before my inevitable and willing death. The hour is 11 p.m. and I sit at my writing desk in my office; my good friend Asogi stands at my shoulder. He has expressed his intent to invoke the dying ritual of the duel, that I may depart this world with honour. An honour of which I am utterly undeserving. The Japanese are a truly merciful people. I, Klint van Zieks, lord of the manor of the van Zieks estate, hereby confess to the following: I am the killer who has come to be known in society as "The Professor", guilty of four counts of murder. I will not here discourse the corruption rife among the aristocracy, which is to me, as one of them, so apparent. However, six months ago, I took the life of a member of the House of Lords at the heart of the depravity. A demon who habitually sacrificed the common man to further his own interests, abusing his position of power. The law is impotent against such vile avarice. Only a fellow demon can rid society of this menace. That demon was my quarry, upon whom I willingly set my great hound. But though I am a hunter of some experience, I am a poor felon, it seems. My guilt was at once recognized by another, and I became subject to his extortion. He held over me the threat of exposing my wicked crime to my beloved wife and brother. Under that threat, I have done this man's bidding for months now, killing those he demanded I kill. As I watched my former mentor perish before my eyes at the jaws of the hound I commanded... ...I realised that I had lost the last shred of decency within me...and sunk to the level of a wild beast. There is no path back to the light. Be it I or my dear friend Asogi who dies this night...I am eternally damned. To my extortioner, Mael Stronghart...may you feel the jaws of the beast at your throat every time you swallow.'</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
So now we know! Yes, Klint van Zieks was <span style="color:#E16935">a murderer</span>... ...but somebody was directing him and naming his victims. His <span style="color:#E16935">extortioner</span>, Lord Mael Stronghart...it was you!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Lord Stronghart, a moment ago... ...you claimed that what the court has just heard could destroy justice in this country. But you weren't trying to protect justice at all. All you were trying to do... ...was conceal the secret of <span style="color:#E16935">your true nature</span> and the countless lives you've sacrificed up till now!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...It just didn't make sense to me. That the third victim, the former Lord Chief Justice, was my brother's benefactor, and a man of lofty principles. As I said...Klint had no possible reason to kill the man!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
But you did, didn't you, Lord Stronghart? To eliminate the man who stood between you and the office you'd set your sights on! So you used your own hunting dog - Lord Klint van Zieks - to take him down!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... It had to be done.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
London's unsavoury shadows are deep, and the arm of the law fails to reach their depths. Crime must be cut off at the roots! But the Lord Chief Justice at the time couldn't see that! He was weak! Lofty principles, you say? Tantamount to cowardice if you ask me! Which is why I took his place. In order to fight the crime he was allowing to spread like wildfire.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
By murdering the man?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The Reaper...the Professor...the name makes no difference. As I've explained countless times already, it was all done for the furtherance of law and order in London!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Are you going to legitimise the murder of my father now, too?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Ah, Genshin Asogi... Well, that was unfortunate. I had fully intended to send him back to Japan as we'd agreed.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I don't believe you! It was you, wasn't it? You killed him!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... No, it wasn't me who took your father's life.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then who?!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
On the night following his mock execution... ...I went to Lowgate Cemetery at three in the morning with Jigoku.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
J-Judge Jigoku?!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
There had to be <span style="color:#E16935">a collaborator</span> on the Japanese side to manage Asogi's treatment after his repatriation. Jigoku had fierce ambition. ...It made him easy to manipulate. Ten years ago, after he'd stood trial for the destruction of the witness stand, I had words with him. When I told him the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs could be his, he couldn't agree fast enough!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Seishiro... You fool...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
As you know, Asogi escaped the prison in a closed casket and was subsequently interred. We intended to dig him out of his grave before he ran out of air. But sadly...all did not go to plan.
</p>
<hr />
<center>AAAAAAAAAGH!!!</center>
<hr />
<p>There was an unexpected visitor to the cemetery with his own ideas about digging up graves. A man who witnessed what <span style="color:#E16935">nobody was supposed to see</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Enoch Drebber...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Of course, I knew graverobbers frequented London's cemeteries. But that grave on that particular night...
</p>
<hr />
<center>Blast! If people find out that the convict wasn't really executed... ...the scandal will rock the very foundations of the empire!
<p><br />
Then, then what do we do?
</p><p>Shoot him, Mr Jigoku! Shoot Asogi at once! He can't live now this has happened! He has to go!
</p><p>What are you talking about? You had an agreement! You promised him he could return to Japan!
</p><p>Everything has changed now. If the truth got out because of this... ...both of us would be finished. Forever!
</p><p>...!
</p><p>Come on, Jigoku, do it! Pull the trigger! SHOOOOOOT!
</p>
*BANG!*</center>
<hr />
<center>Jigoku shot Asogi from the shadows. The graverobber was so close, the blood sprayed over his coat. He fled as fast as his legs would carry him. Then Jigoku and I put Asogi's body back in the grave from which he'd just emerged.</center>
<p><br />
Stronghart:<br />
When I later learnt of the waxwork modeller's presence at the scene as well, I made her swear to two things: Never to remove the Professor's mask. And never to speak of the events of that night. And with that...the secret was buried along with Asogi's corpse. So...now you know what really happened in Lowgate Cemetery that night.
</p>
<center>.........</center>
<hr />
<p>Stronghart:<br />
It was Jigoku, your Japanese acquaintance, who killed Asogi in the end, you see. He claimed to be the man's friend, but when push came to shove, he pulled the trigger.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Just before Mr Jigoku left the courtroom earlier... ...he said that the assassin exchange proposal was <span style="color:#E16935">a demand</span> from his British counterpart, not a request.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So you coerced him, too? Using what happened in the graveyard!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
By that time, Jigoku was the Minister of Foreign Affairs negotiating international treaties with Britain. You can imagine what would have happened if it came to light he'd murdered a compatriot ten years earlier. He would have lost everything. ...I merely reminded him of that.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
How do you sleep at night...?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... These past ten years, I've fought tirelessly with the darker recesses of London's criminal underworld. And I've used whatever means necessary to ensure that justice prevails and law and order reign supreme!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That couldn't be further from the truth. The fact is...you haven't fought crime at all!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
How dare you?! I saved Klint van Zieks from dishonour in his death!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Whilst behind the scenes, you systematically buried anyone who stood in your way. And then you made my father take the blame!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
It was unavoidable! It was the only way to protect our justice system and public order!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Let's not forget the others you had killed as well. Setting the defendant up as the Reaper to cover up the truth behind the murders of countless more!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
That's...ENOOOUGH! Do you have any idea of the conniving that led to the acquittals of those WRETCHED criminals?! We have to fight fire with fire! Our courts can't function without a Reaper! Can't you see all I've done for this country?! This has been my struggle!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />

</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You've done nothing! It's Lord van Zieks here who worked tirelessly and justly in court, whilst enduring the disgrace of the Reaper name!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And Inspector Gregson! Fraught with anguish for having sullied his hands through a desire to do the right thing! Not to mention Genshin Asogi, who risked his life going in pursuit of the truth you tried to hide! No, the darker recesses of London's underworld...were largely filled by you!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
You little... When will you get it through your thick skulls...?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
That it was all for Queen and Country? I'm tiring of that excuse. You've consistently twisted the truth for bargaining power to make others do your bidding. Nothing more.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
People who willingly twist the truth and coerce others have no right to call themselves part of the judiciary! I strongly suggest, you don't EVER talk of justice again!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Grrr... Garrrrrrrrr... GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Well, well, well... Dear me, my good fellows! Dear me! A well-deserved round of applause, I think, for a quite marvellous performance!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
W-What are you talking about?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Those delightfully grave expressions! That beautifully pronounced Queen's English! Really, our friends from the Far East are quite the picture of industriousness!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You fraud... Keep your mockery!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Please, don't misunderstand! It really is exactly as you've both said.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What are you trying to say?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I have occupied the darker recesses of London's underworld and - how did you put it? 'Done nothing'? I confess it's a little embarrassing to have it pointed out quite so starkly, but yes... ...I really have '<span style="color:#E16935">done nothing</span>'. Which means... ...I can be indicted for nothing. ...No?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
WHAT?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
It's true! Personally, I have committed no crime! I've merely been surrounded by fools who've acted very rashly indeed!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest?cb=20210426093406" class="image"><img alt="Objection Ryu English" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="187" data-image-name="Objection Ryu English.png" data-image-key="Objection_Ryu_English.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/e/e2/Objection_Ryu_English.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210426093406" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You, you can't get away with that! You've consistently preyed on people's weaknesses...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
And what? Threatened them? Are you sure it wasn't just bargaining? I would like to address all the good lords, ladies and gentlemen of the judiciary here present. You all know of these darker recesses in our great capital. And deep down, I believe you also know... ...that to fight those who dwell there requires at least some of us to occupy the darkness ourselves.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
So let me appeal to your good sense now. Consider the situation with me... If this catalogue of horrifying revelations... ...were to become common knowledge among the six million inhabitants of London, what might happen?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
To learn that the infamous murderer of royals and nobles was a respected member of the aristocracy himself... That evidence was fabricated in the scapegoat's trial amid secret negotiations with prosecutors to effect a jailbreak... That the Reaper of the Bailey was an organised group of assassins managed by a Scotland Yard inspector... And finally... ...that it was all masterminded by the Lord Chief Justice himself!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
If the general public of Britain knew the truth... ...all faith in the police and Prosecutor's Office would be completely lost...without doubt.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Public order in the capital would completely break down. We'd be cast back to the lawless days of the last century.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Precisely. As it was a hundred years ago, when one in ten of the population were criminals. Think what we've accomplished since then: a public policing force, a comprehensive set of laws... And if we want to continue to protect this new era of law and order... ...I say again: we must at times occupy the darkness ourselves! We have successfully identified and apprehended the man responsible for taking Inspector Gregson's life. That is all that was expected of this trial. All these other matters that have been discussed... ...will be eliminated from the minutes of these proceedings...in the interests of preserving law and order! And to protect Her Majesty the Queen, of course. Well, my lords, ladies and gentlemen? What say you?
</p>
<center>He has a point...<br />The things Lord Stronghart has done are quite unforgivable...<br />But on the other hand...<br />Isn't it our duty to maintain law and order in the capital?<br />You can't deny that the threat of the Reaper over the years has done wonders for the crime rate...<br />And by fair means or foul, that's all thanks to Lord Stronghart!<br />Stronghart! Stronghart! Stronghart! Stronghart!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Are, are you hearing this?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
This is the will of the British judiciary?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
For your rousing response, friends... I express my heartfelt gratitude. Therefore, in accordance with the overwhelming wishes of the court, the records shall be erased!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You have to respect the man's ability to turn a situation to his favour... Lord Stronghart really is a master of manipulation.)</span>

You're always tardy, Counsel. I have no sympathy for tardiness.

Fear not, Mr Naruhuodo! I certainly won't object if you decided to make...perhaps a wiser choice now?

Y-Yes, right! A wise choice. Of course. Here it comes...

I am your judicial assistant, Mr Naruhodo. I shall stand by you until the bitter end. ...No matter what misguided choices you might make!

Oh my! Yes, Mr Sholmes asked if you had that with you earlier...

We've exposed all of Lord Stronghart's wrongdoing now. I've no doubt that Mr Sholmes had already deduced exactly how the truth would unfurl.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So I think it must be time for the great detective to take centre stage, don't you?
</p><p>Susato:<br />

Alright, here goes! HEEEEEEAVE!

</p>
<center>It's Mr Sholmes!</center>
<p><br />
Mikotoba:<br />
I, I wasn't expecting you back, Sholmes.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Delighted to be here again...Lord Stronghart.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
What, what is the meaning of this? Bailiff! Seize him! Put that man in irons! This is... This is a closed court! You've been warned once already, man!
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
W-Wot the... We, we can't get an 'old of 'im, My Lord! We, we just go right through 'im!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I'm afraid your efforts are wasted. You see... ...the great detective you see before you, is composed entirely of light and shadow. An image, if you will. Mr Naruhodo, I must congratulate you on your fine deductions.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
M-Mr Sholmes! What on earth is...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Are you familiar, I wonder, with the invention known as the telephone?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, well yes... I hear that some public telephones have been installed recently in Tokyo.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The sound of the speaker's voice is converted to an electrical signal and transmitted instantly to another place.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Quite. Sounds are transmitted. So could not images keep them company, I mused. Iris and I did some modest experimentation to develop such a device specifically for this very day.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
'<span style="color:#E16935">Modest experimentation</span>', Mr Sholmes? What a modest description!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And, somewhat incidentally, I thought we might just as well transit an entire scene.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
'<span style="color:#E16935">Somewhat incidentally</span>', Mr Sholmes? Now you're just being immodest!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Do, do you mean to say...you're <span style="color:#E16935">not actually here</span>, Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, I knew my trusty partner would have no trouble grasping the concept.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Except he's grasping the stand to steady himself after your shock arrival.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Poor Father... I would have hoped he might have been forewarned, being the great detective's great partner.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Leave my courtroom at once! Get out! Or I swear to you...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Dear me. You on the other hand, Lord Stronghart, appear to have a very poor grasp of the situation. Allow me to reiterate: I am not 'here'. Which would, I hope, lead naturally to one asking...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Where exactly are you?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The very question I was awaiting! I am at present enjoying the air in a rather splendid garden.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A garden?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Not just any garden, you understand. A garden at Buckingham Palace.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
What?! You, you can't be! Buckingham Palace?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's Buckingham Palace, Miss Susato? I've never heard of it.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Do you ever read the news, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...Mr Sholmes... ...is Iris with you there?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, well now... Iris is currently enjoying some tea... ...with Her Majesty.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Her, Her Majesty?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Not just any 'Her Majesty' you understand. Her Majesty the Queen of the British Empire.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What on earth is all this about?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Buckingham Palace is Her Majesty the Queen's residence in London, Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Order! Order in court! I demand immediate silence! Her, Her Majesty the Queen? You can't be...? I mean... No... This, this is some sort of unforgivably distasteful trickery by a third-rate detective, that's all!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
'Unforgivably distasteful trickery'... What an apt description. A closed court session attended by elite members of the judiciary is a rare event. I presumed that Her Majesty would be more than a little curious about the proceedings. So...I decided to show her. Everything...from start to finish.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh?! You <span style="color:#E16935">showed her</span>?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed. By dint of the Herlock Sholmes <span style="color:#E16935">Remote Cinematograph</span>!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
You...meddling...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
This is some kind of nightmare...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Just as I appear to be standing before you, regaling you with talk of my latest invention... ...no doubt you've inferred...that <span style="color:#E16935">the reverse</span> is also true.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
You, you don't mean...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Her Majesty has seen and heard every moment of the proceedings. I assumed there would be no objection. After all... ...every trial in this country is conducted under the auspices of Her Majesty, as you know!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
You... You...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I confess, I am quite impatient to hear Her Majesty's opinion... ...about the 'unforgivably distasteful trickery' in which you've been engaged over the past ten years.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
N-No! I, I was merely...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, so sorry to keep you all waiting! Vicky and I had so much to talk about!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Iris! There you are!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
In fact, I have a little <span style="color:#E16935">message</span> here from Her Majesty.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
A, a message...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well then, if everyone is sitting comfortably? Ahem... 'Forthwith and with immediate effect, all authority previously afforded to Mael Stronghart... ...is hereby revoked for evermore.'
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...Ah...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
'Furthermore, he will be prosecuted for crimes against his country in a public trial by jury in the coming days.'
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So...it seems that Her Majesty doesn't believe we need to fight fire with fire. Justice in this country needn't be administered from the shadows at all.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mael Stronghart... ...the darkness you fostered to conceal your despicable actions these last ten years is a thing of the past now. After today... ...your brand of 'law and order' has no future. Because no longer are you the Lord Chief Justice... In the eyes of the law, and of Her Majesty the Queen... you are nothing...but a criminal!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Adjourned! Adjourned! Adjourned! Adjourned! Adjourned! COURT IS ADJOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURNED!!!
</p><p>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Stronghart:<br />
'Lord Klint van Zieks left a will in which he confessed to everything.' When those words came out of Asogi's mouth... it deranged me completely. I knew I must do anything and everything in my power to contain the situation. But I couldn't find the damned document. I searched his cell, but it wasn't there.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Which precipitated the jailbreak plot, I presume?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
W-What do you mean?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... The need to obtain that will was all-consuming. I was sure that if I facilitated Asogi's escape, he would emerge with the will somewhere on his person. But despite searching his limp body in the cemetery that night...it still eluded me. It never even crossed my mind that it was concealed in the sword's hilt.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What pains me now... ...is that my brother left this world without a word to me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm sorry, Lord van Zieks...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
In point of fact... ...I think perhaps that isn't the case.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
How can that be?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There is <span style="color:#E16935">more</span> to his last will and testament.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?
</p>
<hr />
<center>'As I confront the prospect of my demise... I feel bitter regret for my younger brother. Barok, you have always looked up to me, and now, you follow in my steps to become a prosecutor. It is my fervent wish that my unspeakable deeds should not hinder your advancement. I ask not for understanding, for none could understand my depravity. I ask only for forgiveness.'</center>
<p><br />
Susato:<br />
'Asogi is a fine detective, and a hunter worthy of respect. He has agreed to honour my final two wishes. The first is that this document survives. The second...I cannot commit to paper. I have confessed my sins to my wife. May she find resolution in my death. With my eternal gratitude to my Japanese friend, I rest my quill.<br />
Klint van Zieks'
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Klint...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mael Stronghart... ...you colluded with Seishiro Jigoku in a criminal plot so immense, it spanned the oceans. And you cold-heartedly murdered all those who knew the truth about what happened ten years ago. But why did you set about that now, a whole decade later?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... To ascend to the very peak.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
These last ten years made me realise: Being the Lord Chief Justice wasn't enough. Short of becoming Her Majesty's Attorney General... ...I could have no real power to effect the changes needed in this country. And for that promotion...I needed to ensure no 'remnants' of the past remained.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
How could you...?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I like everything to run smoothly, in the exact manner that I prescribe. Like a well-oiled machine. And I was just a step away...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And for your ambition to succeed... ...did you even bother to count the number of brilliant people you had killed?!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, Mr Reaper, are you not forgetting something?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Such as...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You've very much adopted your usual prosecutor-like demeanour in the proceedings now. But the reality of the situation is that you are <span style="color:#E16935">the defendant</span> in this trial.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
However, the presiding judge would appear to have fallen from the bench, as it were. May I suggest, therefore, that we entrust the final adjudication to an old friend?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
M-My Lord!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
As a member of the judiciary, I have been following the proceedings from the gallery. And I must say...I shan't ever forget the extraordinary battle between good and evil that I witnessed here today. The darkness that has blighted justice in our land these past ten years has at last been dispelled. Thanks, in no small part, to the efforts of a bright young star from the East. Defence Counsel Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Y-Yes, My Lord?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
On behalf of everyone here present in the Old Bailey, I give you my heartfelt thanks.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You're too kind, My Lord!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The first time I faced you in court, just under a year ago now... ...I had the faintest of intimations. That if British justice, so warped and twisted over its long history, was finally to know change... ...this might just be the man to do it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But at the time, I wouldn't allow myself to acknowledge the possibility. I couldn't overcome my hatred of the Japanese, after the circumstances of my brother's death. Mr Naruhodo... Allow me to apologise for countless discourtesies on my part. You are a lawyer of boundless talent.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, Lord van Zieks...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... When I first arrived in Great Britain... ...I was literally a nobody. Certainly not a lawyer. The truth is, my fortunes have entirely been made by the miraculous people I've met. My best friend, Kazuma Asogi, who led me here to Britain in the first place... My loyal and ever-patient judicial assistant, Miss Susato, who helped me study to become a lawyer... The brilliant Lord van Zieks, who never failed to challenge his 'Nipponese' rival. And not to mention... ...the exceptional master of logic and reasoning, who showed me the true art of deduction...Mr Sholmes.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Saving the best for last, Mr Naruhodo? ...What a relief.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm well aware...that without all these people's help and support, I wouldn't be where I am today. The truth is a guiding light that always leads to happiness.  I've lived by that principle for a long time now. But actually, it's not true.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The truth can also cause great pain. Sometimes even leave people on the brink of despair.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
And for that reason, there are those who feel the need to hide the truth. Who do it instinctively, even.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But as soon as we allow our eyes to settle on something other than the truth...the darkness takes hold. And from there it grows, until eventually...it makes us blind to the guiding light of the truth altogether. So that's why it's my belief... ...that we must all resolve never to avert our eyes from what is just and true. So that we can continue to walk the straight and narrow path ahead.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, I must excuse myself now. But before I go, Mr Naruhodo, let me compliment you on your grand opus.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Without your beautifully composed case against Lord Stronghart, Her Majesty would have been unable to act. Thanks to you and your fellows, the haunting undertones corrupting Britain's justice system have been silenced!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Erm... Thank you very much!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So...until our paths cross again somewhere!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well then... ...it would appear that this long trial has finally come to an end.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... My apologies for any anxiety caused, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I'm quite sure we shall meet again here in the courtroom before long, Prosecutor Barok van Zieks. In conclusion of these proceedings, I hereby declare the defendant, Barok van Zieks...
</p>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
That is all. Court is adjourned!

Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It...really is all over. ...But did I sacrifice too much?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo... I really must congratulate you. It was a truly...truly splendid performance! Honestly...I couldn't be happier for you!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, thank you very much. But I really couldn't have done it without you at my side through it all, Miss Susato.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! ......... Your kind words mean so much to me.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
It really was a very splendid show, that, Naruhodo. I'd have thought you'd be smiling from ear to ear, but you look rather glum.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Well...of course I'm delighted about the verdict. But in exposing the truth, I'm afraid I've caused my client a great deal of pain. I'm really not sure that's what a lawyer ought to be doing.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh well, in that case... ...I'm quite sure that when you see Lord van Zieks's smiling face, everything will seem much better!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Um, Miss Susato... ...everything seems worse. He has a face like thunder.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear... I really shouldn't have presumed...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Mr Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Uh! Um...yes?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Almost a year it's been now, since I first encountered you here in this very courthouse. For you to have risen to the level of excellence you demonstrated today... Well, it's quite remarkable.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but I... I exposed the most unpalatable truth you could ever have imagined in court today. I feel as though I've robbed you of something you held so dear...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... What was it he said? 'To fight those who dwell in the darkness requires at least some of us to occupy the darkness ourselves.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But that... That was just the feeble excuse of a coward. Only those with a steadfast eye for the truth have what it takes to fight the dark forces of crime. You made fine work of establishing that fact in court today.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh... Well...thank you!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What magnanimous words! ...I'm quite sure that Kazuma-sama would have a smile on his face at this very moment if he were here!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Kazuma...)</span>
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Um, Miss Susato... ...there's another face like thunder here.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh my! And he really was here...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
Lord van Zieks... Allow me to congratulate you on your acquittal.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Congratulate me? Or <span style="color:#E16935">curse</span> me? You failed to bring down the Reaper.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... I owe you an apology.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... No, it is I who should apologise. Your father, Genshin... If I had been stronger, then perhaps... I made an unforgivable error of judgement. ...I can offer no excuse.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... And I can offer no forgiveness. That said......... ...I suppose you fought for justice and the truth. For that at least, I can't withhold respect.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Your words mean more to me than you could know. I will hold them dear.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Kazuma-sama...
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
......... I must say... ...there's one thing that's still bothering me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's that?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">The will</span> that Lord Klint van Zieks wrote before his duel with my father.

</p><p>Susato:<br />
Father?!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
It was ten years ago, as you know. The day before... Before the execution was scheduled. I went to the prison to say my farewells to Genshin.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Mikotoba:<br />
Why aren't you putting up more of a fight, Genshin? If you'd only agree to it, Seishiro and I would gladly petition the government...
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
We've been through this already. You don't need to worry about me. Anyway, Yujin... ...I have a favour to ask of you. Something of great importance.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
You're one of my greatest friends, Genshin. Whatever it is, consider it done.
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
......... I'm going to tell you an address. I need you to go there at once, in secret and telling no one. You should find a lady of the gentry in hiding there.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
A lady of the gentry?
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
She's not in a good way. And she's with child. The birth is imminent. As a medical man, I'd like you to attend to her. Please, you're her only hope.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
By any chance...is the child yours, Genshin?
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
Don't be daft. It's a favour that was asked of me by a man I knew... as his dying wish.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
My goodness...
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
I swore to the man that I would help. That I would do whatever I could for his wife and his unborn child. But if something should happen to me... ...I need to ask you that same favour. You're the only person I know that I can truly rely on.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
W-What did you say? 'If' something should happen to you?! Tomorrow night, you're going to be...! To be.........
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
Heh heh heh... You never know though, do you? What life will bring.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
......... Alright then. Tell me the address. I'll head there at once with Seishiro and-
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
No. Not with him.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Pardon?
</p><p>Asogi:<br />
This is a favour I'm asking of you. And only you, Yujin.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
......... Right. I see. ...Very well, then.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Mikotoba:<br />
That very night, I caught a train from Paddington to Dartmoor in Devon. I found the old house. In the middle of nowhere, it was. An old hunting hound lay asleep in the grounds. The poor woman was on the floor at the back of a darkened room. She was in mortal danger. I broke her waters to precipitate the labour before she weakened further, but it was a tortuous birth. I did everything humanly possibly <i>[sic]</i> for her and her child. And in the end, I was lucky enough to welcome a new life into the world. But tragically... ...my efforts to save the mother's life were in vain. I held the healthy newborn girl in my arms and wept for...longer than I care to remember. Eventually, in something of a daze, I looked around the room.
</p>
<center>There was precious little in it. But an old travel trunk caught my eye. It had clearly been well looked after over the years. Made of top-quality leather with fine stitching. But it was when I saw the emblem on the side of it that everything dropped into place. 'B' for 'Baskerville'.</center>
<p><br />
Susato:<br />
B-<span style="color:#E16935">Baskerville</span>?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You mean...the woman was the wife of Lord Klint van Zieks?!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
That's right. The newborn was his daughter.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But...but that makes no sense! Why on earth wouldn't Klint have entrusted the child to my care in that case?! I was completely unaware that he even had a daughter!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I suppose...he didn't really have any choice.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, your brother said that he'd <span style="color:#E16935">confessed</span> everything to his wife. So she must have been beside herself with worry for her child. If <span style="color:#E16935">the true identity</span> of the Professor were ever to be made public... ...the girl would be forever branded as the daughter of the infamous mass murderer.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
So the only solution... ...was to distance the young girl from the van Zieks family as much as possible.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I...don't believe it...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I imagine that in his final hour, Lord Klint van Zieks made the obvious choice. He would have thought to himself, 'This Japanese man here is someone I can <span style="color:#E16935">trust</span>...'
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I honoured my promise to Genshin, of course. However... ...only a month later, I was summoned back to Japan. And without disclosing the parentage of the child, I couldn't obtain permission to take her with me.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh how awful...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I was completely at a loss. In the end, I had to ask my <span style="color:#E16935">great friend</span>. I asked him if he would be a father to her.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That...being Mr Sholmes, I presume?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Yes. He took one look into my eyes and agreed to it on the spot.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Mr Sholmes... He has a heart of gold...)</span>
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Really, all it can be said that I did for the child... ...was to give her a name.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
When I'd come to Britain, I was trying to escape from the grief of losing my darling wife. So it was her name that I gave the little girl.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Your wife's name, Professor Mikotoba... In other words...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...The name of my mother... Ayame Mikotoba.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
That's right, Ayame. Or in English...<span style="color:#E16935">Iris</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Iris...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... I, I had no idea...

</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
<span style="color:green">Ah, my dear fellows! Can you hear me?</span>

Mr Sholmes...is that you?

<span style="color:green">You see what excessive tugging can do? Let that be a lesson to you!</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Sholmes, we weren't able to thank you properly before, but you were simply marvellous! Your checkmate move was a stroke of genius!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
<span style="color:green">Indeed it was, wasn't it? I surpassed myself, I feel. It had become apparent to me that to stop the Lord Chief Injustice would require such measures.</span>

Oh, um...I'm sure she did. After all, no one brews a more delicious tea than you do, Iris.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
<span style="color:green">Let's have a party to celebrate! And Mr Reaper, you simply must come, too!</span>

<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
Well, I think I ought to be leaving. Lord van Zieks, would you care to accompany me?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Certainly. Mr Naruhodo, allow me once again to express my deep gratitude to you. I believe...you saved my life.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wait, Lord van Zieks!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Yes?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um... What are you intending to do now?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Well clearly, I shall have to resign from the Prosecutor's Office.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh no!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I intend to publicise the full truth about the Professor case. Once that's done, the van Zieks family will be ostracised completely from London society.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Surely not...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So as soon as I am free from my employment, I shall leave the capital.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...I see...
</p><p>???:
</p>
<center>Don't be a fool.</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:<br />
Are those the actions of a man once feared as the mighty Reaper of the Bailey?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I beg your pardon?
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
For the past ten years, you've endured that pseudonym and been cast as one of the dark forces yourself. Now that you've finally been freed from that disrepute, your battle is just beginning, surely?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Well...I certainly never expected to hear those words from your lips.
</p><p>Kazuma:<br />
I waited a very long time to come to London. Now I'm properly here, I intend to learn all that I can. Anyway, goodbye for now... Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Kazuma Asogi... It seems as though he's really matured suddenly.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
He's not the only one who's matured, Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, I think we should make our way back to Baker Street. We must help Iris with tonight's dinner!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We must!

</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
......... I would believe it, yes.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I say, Mikotoba...I detect not a hint of surprise.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I wonder why that is, hm? Maybe because I was there at the scene as well, Sholmes.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
What?! You were?! Then why the deuce didn't you say so before?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Not quite the sight I was expecting to behold, but still... ...it's hard not to feel privileged to see it.)</span> Hello, Mr Sholmes! Professor Mikotoba. I'm finally back from the Bailey.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And not a moment too soon! A feast prepared by Iris and Miss Susato awaits!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I must say, I haven't seen Susato looking so happy in a very long time.

Ah, Runo! There you are!

......... Well...the boss ain't around no more, so...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
An' anyway, no matter 'ow 'ard I try... ...that Reaper ain't never gonna accept a diver-turned-dick, is 'e?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well...people can change, you know...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah yes, that reminds me... ...I rather thoughtfully offered to relieve the bailiff of this now-defunct piece of evidence.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's...the inspector's pocket watch! <span style="color:#0070C0">(And the crown has been reattached.)</span>
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
That watch was his pride and joy. A symbol of his great achievements at Scotland Yard. For ten years without fail, it measured every second of the man's remarkable career.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But now...it's stopped...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Someone needs to keep the memory of Inspector Gregson's career alive... ...by taking on the great responsibility of winding that watch every single day again.

</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... It's gotta be me! There ain't no one else!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Quite right...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I mean, after all, the boss was... Well, 'e was MY boss.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, Ginny! Yes he was!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Oh yeah, and I made you a promise an' all, didn't I, Iris? That I'd become a proper detective one day an' track down yer <span style="color:#E16935">old man</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Alright then, it's decided! I'll do it! An' I swear... ...I'll find yer <span style="color:#E16935">dad</span> an' bring 'im in kickin' an' screamin'!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I'm...not entirely sure that would be appropriate.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I think, Gina...it might be best to, well...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I think I'd like you to forget that promise, Ginny.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Eh?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, obviously I've always wondered about who my real daddy is. Of course I have. I wanted to know where I've come from. I thought it might tell me something about myself. But I've caused such a lot of trouble trying to find out. For so many people. Hurley, Runo, Professor Mickey...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Oh no, not at all, my dear! Really, you owe no apology to anyone...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well anyway, I've decided to give up on it. Because I've finally realised: My daddy...is the greatest in the world! I don't think it matters what his name is or where he's from. Don't you agree? Hurley?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... With every word, Iris.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Thank you, Hurley. ...Thank you, Daddy.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... I think, Mikotoba...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Yes, Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I think that I ought to express my gratitude to you.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Oh?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
For six years, you and I solved many a mystery together. And during that time, I remember countless expressions of gratitude for our good services. But a moment ago, I heard the most pleasing expression of gratitude of them all. And I should never have experienced it...were it not for you.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
You old softy, Sholmes... But I must confess, it's a weight off my mind to hear you say it.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well then! I think this calls for a lengthy violin recital, wouldn't you say?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, well...the food would go cold, that's the only problem. Maybe next week, Hurley?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
...Are you sure a week is long enough, Iris? Ah ha ha ha ha hah!

</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Are you alone? I didn't hear any sound from Susato's room.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, Susato-san went out after dinner. She took a carriage. Something about an important matter she needed to take care of.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Ah...I see. ......... I wanted to thank you for what you did earlier.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
With Iris, I mean. When the subject of her father came up.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Lord Klint van Zieks...)</span>
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I made up my mind many years ago never to tell her who her real father was. It's what was agreed with Genshin after all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Lord Klint van Zieks's final wishes before he died, you mean?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Yes. I've had to take some rather drastic steps at times to protect that secret, you know. ...Calling Susato back to Japan six months ago, for example.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's why?)</span>
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
When I read Soseki-san's report about his final days in London, my heart nearly stopped. You'd stumbled across the crux of that terrible case: the dog's <span style="color:#E16935">collar</span>. The description of the Baskerville insignia left me in no doubt.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Baskerville...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
If you'd decided to investigate that insignia, sooner or later you'd have made the connection to the van Zieks. And to make matters worse, Susato knew of the unpublished story as well. The story that Iris had written based on my notes from the time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah yes, '<span style="color:#E16935">The Hound of the Baskervilles</span>'...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Exactly. It was a work of fiction, but based on the grim reality of a huge beast of a dog being used as a murder weapon. A dog with the Baskerville family emblem around its neck. Armed with those two clues, I feared you and Susato might arrive at the truth. So I invented that story about having collapsed to justify her leaving London and returning to Japan at once. All in aid of halting any investigations you and she might have been contemplating.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I see... Something I've never understood... ...is why Susato-san came across that manuscript <span style="color:#E16935">in Japan</span>, though. You know, Iris's 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' story, I mean.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Sholmes sent it to me. That was before Susato left Japan. He was very troubled about what should be done about it, you see. I'd read it and carelessly left it on my desk. Which is where Susato came across it, of course.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
It was the only case Sholmes and I ever pursued that I didn't record in meticulous detail. I was stunned when I discovered that young Iris had pieced together so much of it from my paltry notes. Sholmes and I discussed the matter, and decided that we couldn't allow the story's publication. At that point, I returned the manuscript by post to Sholmes for safekeeping.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...So you did all that to stop Iris from finding out the truth about her father...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
That's right. Because Sholmes had told me how astute she'd become. ......... However, having witnessed events in court today, I must say my opinion has somewhat shifted.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I think at some point in the future, the time will come for Iris to know the truth. And when it does, well... I believe it will be for the best.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I think so, too. ......... Actually, Professor... ...I, I wanted to talk to you about something, too.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
......... Judging from that expression, I'd say you've come to a decision, have you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I have. I...will be returning with you to Japan.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Are you quite sure?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I'm really only here as <span style="color:#E16935">a substitute</span> for Kazuma. But he's here in Britain now, as originally intended. Locum Student Naruhodo doesn't really have a right to stay, I think.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
...I see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Looking back now, when I first arrived here in February... ...my becoming a lawyer just seemed to be the way things turned out. With Kazuma, Susato-san and Mr Sholmes all gently pushing me in that direction. I spent the best part of a year immersed in this world, but always aware of a seed of doubt inside me. Until today. Standing in that courtroom earlier, all doubts vanished from my mind. I was totally focused. I was sure of my belief in my client, and I was sure I could see the trial through. And at the end of it, I finally realised. No one else chose <span style="color:#E16935">the path</span> for me. I chose it myself.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
The path of <span style="color:#E16935">a defence lawyer</span>, eh?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, that's what I am now. That's what I'll be going back with you to Japan as. And that's the path I'll be following for the rest of my life.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well, it sounds like you've made quite <span style="color:#E16935">a resolution</span> there.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I have!
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Very well, then. I must say, it's extremely welcome news. I shall make arrangements for your return first thing tomorrow. But I don't imagine we'll depart for a few days.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Not with the symposium having been cancelled now. Such a shame...
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Never mind. I'm sure there'll be other opportunities in the future. ...Well then, I'll bid you good night.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
S-Susato-san...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I...just wanted to let you know I'm back.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Did you, um... ...hear what your father and I were discussing?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm sorry, I did, yes. I...couldn't help but...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! ...How much did you hear?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well... ...from the part about Iris's real father, I think.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...In other words, from the beginning.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... So you've made up your mind. You'll <span style="color:#E16935">return to Japan</span> and continue working as a defence lawyer.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...yes. I'm, I'm sorry. I really should have consulted you about it. I did want to earlier this evening, actually. But you'd already gone out.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh no, that's quite alright. I already knew that it's what you'd decide, Naruhodo-san.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You did?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Um...Susato-san...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah! ...Yes?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I suppose this means it...has to be farewell soon.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I suppose...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You'll be a great help to Kazuma going forward. I mean, I know he's a brilliant lawyer, but he's new to the British courtroom. He'll certainly benefit greatly having a brilliant judicial assistant at his side.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...I'll do my very best.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I wish I could say it, but I just can't. I can't ask her to come with me. After all... ...she was always supposed to be coming to Britain as Kazuma's assistant.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...It's growing late. We should both try to get some sleep. I'm sure you must be exhausted after today.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, yes...you're right.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Before I retire, let me just say one more time: You really were quite splendid in court today. So if you ask me... ...anyone who thinks of you as a substitute or a locum should be ashamed of themselves!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Susato-san... ...Thank you.
</p>

<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I can't believe this day's finally come...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...You're really leaving then, Runo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm afraid so, Iris. Thank you so much for everything. I don't know what I'll do without your wonderful cooking and delicious tea.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh...I wish you weren't going... But, but you have to come back and visit! Say you will!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Of course. ...I promise.
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
Well, it was a very brief reunion, but... ...it was a pleasure to pursue a case with you again after so long. For a while at least, it felt like old times.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, I...suppose on reflection... ...there's something to be said for it. Having a little fun once in a while.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I'll just go and say goodbye to the professor as well, I think.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Alright, Iris, you do that.
</p>
<center>*HOOOOOONK*</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Susato-san...</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>I've just checked, Naruhodo-san. Your luggage is already on board. Such a beautiful morning. Perfect for embarking on a journey, isn't it?</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Before I set off...I'd just like to say how thankful I am for everything you've done for me. And give my warmest regards to Kazuma, please.</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>Actually...I think you ought to give him your regards in person, don't you?</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>...Sorry?</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>Ryunosuke...</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Kazuma! Wh-What are you doing here?!</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>Ha ha ha ha hah! Do you really think I'd miss my best friend's departure?</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>...Thanks. To be honest, I'd been looking forward to our wild time tearing up the streets of Her Majesty's capital, but...</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>Mm. Well...we'll have to save that for another time. Personally, I'm looking forward to facing you in court again.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Me too. ...But...we're both defence lawyers so...</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>I'm going to become a prosecutor. I'll stay in Lord van Zieks's tutelage for the time being, but before long... ...I intend to be just as formidable as the Reaper himself.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Oh...I see.</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>Actually, Ryunosuke, I have a favour to ask.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Name it.</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>I'd like you...to take care of this for me for a while.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">Karuma</span>?! ...Why?</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>Because I've seen it now. I've seen what's inside me. The demon that reared its ugly head that day. It was only for the briefest of moments, the last time I came face to face with that inspector... ...but it was unmistakable. I wanted to <span style="color:#E16935">kill</span> him. I've always known there are demons that live inside people. And now I know there is one in me. The fact that it very nearly consumed me is something I'll carry with me until the end of my days... ...while I devote my life to fighting those whose demons have got the better of them... ...as a prosecutor!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>So...that's what you've resolved to do, is it?</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>Until I'm ready to face the demon with me - to slay it once and for all... ...I leave this in your care. If you'll take it.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Of course I will. I'll keep it by my side. Always.</center>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Until we meet again, then. You have your path to follow, and I have mine.</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>Um...Naruhodo-san... ...the path you're going to follow from now on... I wonder...if I might follow it at your side. Un-Unless I'd be a burden?</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Wha...? I mean...I, I w-would very much like you to come with me! But, but aren't you...?</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>Hah hah ha ha ha hah! You're so predictable, Ryunosuke!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>I am?</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>Honestly, you never change at all! But that's what I like about you.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>You, you mean...you knew about this?</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>It was the evening after Lord van Zieks's trial came to an end. She came to see me at the Prosecutor's Office.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Really? <span style="color:#0070C0">(When I had that conversation with Professor Mikotoba...)</span></center>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:
</p>
<center>So you'd go with Ryunosuke back to Japan?</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>...Yes. I know it's unfair of me to follow my own interests like this.</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>Coming here especially to tell me... You're a stickler for etiquette, aren't you? Well...what are his feelings?</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>We've never discussed it, of course. And Naruhodo-san has made no such suggestion. I worry that perhaps I'd be a burden to him.</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>He's just as much of a stickler for etiquette as you are. He'd never say anything before he was asked. But I'd feel happy knowing you were with him. ...Look out for him on my behalf, will you?</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>Of course!</center>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Susato-san...</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>W-What do you think, Naruhodo-san?</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>With you by my side... no trial would seem too daunting. So if you're willing, I'd be honoured if you'd come with me. Together we can take on the world!</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>I'm terribly incompetent, but if you'll have me, I'd be delighted!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Oh...n-no, not at all! If anyone's terribly incompetent, it's me! Aaagh!</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>What's wrong?</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Your luggage, Susato-san! There's no time! The ship's going to set sail any minute now!</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>Aah... It's alright, there's no need to worry. As it happens, my luggage is...already on board, too.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>It is...?</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>Ah hah hah hah hah hah! Your fine judicial assistant has everything in hand as always, I see.
<p><br />
</p>
*HOOOOOONK*</center>
<p><br />
Iris:
</p>
<center>Ruuunooo! Your ship's about to leave!</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>Time to go then. Look after yourself, Ryunosuke.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Kazuma...draw your sword.</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>...!</center>
<hr />
<p><i>Rendered dialogue</i><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>One day...when our paths cross once more... ...we'll fight a duel. A duel of words, across the courtroom. A day I eagerly await...as a lawyer.</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>......... I've been waiting to hear you say that...partner!</center>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Don't forget me then, Kazuma.</center>
<p><br />
Kazuma:
</p>
<center>As if I could...Ryunosuke!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>And Mr Sholmes...thank you so much. I'm very much indebted to you.</center>
<p><br />
Sholmes:
</p>
<center>Indeed, Mr Naruhodo, I believe you are.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>I'll never forget all you've done for me during my time in London.</center>
<p><br />
Sholmes:
</p>
<center>Quite. I should like to think you will remember your debt of gratitude... ...especially when I visit you in your country.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>What?</center>
<p><br />
Sholmes:
</p>
<center>The truth is, although many are ignorant of the fact... ...the world is far smaller than most folk realise.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center>Well...I'd be delighted if you came to Japan one day!</center>
<p><br />
Susato:
</p>
<center>Oh yes! We'd welcome you with open arms, Mr Sholmes!</center>
<p><br />
Iris:
</p>
<center>Oooh, that sounds wonderful! I can't wait!</center>
<p><br />
Sholmes:
</p>
<center>In that case, let us conclude that this is to be merely a brief parting, my dear fellows!</center>
<hr />
<p><i>Rendered cutscene</i><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
And that brings us to the end of my adventures in Great Britain. A peculiar twist of fate brought me halfway around the world those many months ago. But that was just the start of my journey. Who knows where fate will lead me next? Still, I'm confident this won't be my last meeting with the friends I've made in London. And when we're together again... ...no doubt the first words I'll hear will be...
</p><p><i>Anime cutscene</i><br />
'Come! The game is afoot!' The ship with our friends from the East sailed steadily towards the distant horizon. But Sholmes's face was alight with joy. 'The times may change, but a steadfast friendship will remain true, Wilson.'
</p><p>Iris:<br />
'We have but to gently close our eyes, and we are with our companions once more.' ...So I do just that. And when I do...I can hear his, strong familiar voice ring out.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:
</p>
<center><b>Objection!</b></center>
<p><br />
Iris:<br />
Until we meet again, Runo!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Sholmes:<br />
I've been thoroughly inundated with enquiries about my Remote Cinematograph since that day. But I'm no purveyor of electrical goods! And what of the promised closed court secrecy? Anyway, I've decided an absence from London is in order. A sojourn in distant climes. The Empire of Japan, perhaps... I understand that 'wardrobe class' incurs no charge whatsoever.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Iris:<br />
I gave a little note to Hurley the other day. It just said, 'Thank you for everything, Daddy.' But it made Hurley cry... And I gave him some lotion I'd invented as well. To dye his hair red safely. But he said that might make him cry, too, so he'd rather not use it...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
In those days, when I was known as the Reaper, I felt your presence at my side. Once, unable to bear the burden of that grim pseudonym, I even retired from the courtroom. Despite everything, I still wear your prosecutor's badge with pride. But the darkness that once beset me is no more. As you, too...are no more. In the words of a young foreign friend of mine: I must stride forward...toward a brighter future.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gina:<br />
The boss left a note for me, ya know. An' I can read every letter now. A to Z, the 'ole lot! It's cleared a load o' stuff up. The boss was...tryin' to protect me, see. An' that's exactly wot me an' Chief Inspector Toby 'ere are gonna keep doin' for Londoners! ...I only wish I could o' said 'ow grateful I was before 'e... ya know.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gregson:<br />
Gina... The truth is, I'm not the upstandin' fellow you think I am. You might be a diver at heart, but it's a good heart. You've reminded me I need to be true to myself. I've got one more job to take care of before it's ta-ta to London town for the foreseeable. And then I've gotta complete your education in the art of detection 'à la' Gregson, as they say.

</p><p>Sithe:<br />

</p><p>Gorey:<br />
I'd like to hone my own filleting skills. You don't mind, do you, Mama?
</p><p>Sithe:<br />
Yes, I do. I'm not a corpse yet, am I?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
......... No. And I'm glad.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Harebrayne:<br />
Here I am again in Great Britain on the invitation of my dear old university friend! He sent me a very nice letter saying he'd like to show me around now that everything was settled. B-But what have I done?! I was so excited, I picked this splendid hotel, and now I can't afford the bill! Oh Barok! Come to my rescue again, please! I, I wish I could just vanish into thin air sometimes!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Tusspells:<br />
When I went to make the waxwork impression of the killer in the cemetery, I realised what had happened. But even in the witness stand of the highest court in the land, I could never speak of it. The Lord Chief Justice and I had struck a bargain, you see. For a faithful reproduction of the visage, there is nothing we Tusspells would not do.

</p><p>Evie:<br />
Oh, Daley, how...charming. You've made lots of new friends here, I see.
</p><p>Vigil:<br />
Yes, and when we're released, we're all going to strike it rich together!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kazuma:<br />
When I was accepted on the foreign study tour, I knew exactly what path I had to take. And however it might have ended, I knew that I wanted you there to see it. If I'd ended up in the dock, there's no one I would have rather had defending me. But now, thanks to you...there's a new path I want to take. I'm sure we'll meet again in the courtroom, my friend. Until then...I leave Karuma in your care.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Susato:<br />
I've made some tea, Naruhodo-san. It's important that you rest whilst you can. Once we arrive in Japan, you shall be busy establishing your new office. I'm so delighted to be accompanying you. After all, your talents have been recognised by a great detective! Because you really are the greatest of lawyers! A '<span style="color:#E16935">great ace attorney</span>', some might say!

Is something wrong, Dr Gorey?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Did the last statement give you pause for thought, perhaps?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
...Well, something did just come to mind. If you Easterners come from the other side of the world, are your internal organs all flipped?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
I'm desperate to look.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Strictly speaking, that's not really related to the testimony, is it?
</p><p>Gorey:<br />
Ready for the first incision?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
NO!

Did something about that last statement bother you in some way?
</p><p>Mikotoba:<br />
I feel as though it might have done, as it happens. But you startled me so much, I've clean forgotten what I was thinking.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Perhaps try to remember for next time, then.

Lord van Zieks!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Let me guess: is there something about the witness's last statement that troubles me? Is that what you wish to ask?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Y-Yes... Exactly... You're very perceptive.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Whereas you...would appear not to be.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You really need to learn how to read your fellow man... my Nipponese friend.
