<i>Waiting Hall</i>
</p><p>Maya:<br />
It doesn't make sense...*sob* How has it come to this...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The darned witch! Why did it have to happen to the professor, of all people?!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
You've got to believe me, Nick! I may be a spirit medium, but I'm no witch!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Don't worry, I know it wasn't you!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
...Hmm? Say, have you seen Luke today?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I haven't seen him since last night. He was crying all night... I didn't know what to say to him...
</p><p>Maya:<br />
No kidding... He's the one suffering the most from all this... Poor kid...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
He probably needs some time alone with his grief. We should leave him be.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Yeah... He shouldn't have to see this trial. It'd be too hard for him.
</p><p>Espella:<br />
............
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Oh, it's Espella!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What are you doing here, Espella? Have you been cleared of the accusations?
</p><p>Espella:<br />
No...not yet. If only it was that easy... It's just that... I'm not technically under arrest, so I got special permission to come here. I'm free to go wherever I like...within this building.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ah, I see...
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Uhm... I... I heard about Mr Layton. It's awful... He was such a good man!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............ I'm sorry, Espella.
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Huh? What are you apologising for?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
We were supposed to find clues connected to Bezella... but we couldn't find anything. And now the professor's been...
</p><p>Espella:<br />
No, don't say that! It's not your fault! And I don't believe a word of what they say about Maya! She isn't a witch!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Thank you, Espella...
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Uhm...Mr Wright... Do you mind if I assist you in court today?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Espella:<br />
I...I know I may not be of much use... but I'll do what I can! I want to help you and Maya!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Espella...
</p><p>???:<br />
...Excuse me.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-you're...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Greyerl, butler of the late Master Belduke. I have come to enquire after Miss Maya. It is most regrettable what happened yesterday.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Oh, thank you for coming all the way here! ...Hmm? You look really pale, Jean. Are you all right?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Oh, please don't worry about me. It's merely that, since the incident, sleep has eluded me.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I spent the night searching through Master's notes on alchemy. I hoped there may be some mention... of a method by which something turned to gold may be <span style="color:#E16935">reverted</span> back to its original form.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You were looking for a way to... rescue the professor?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Human fate is often cruel. But that's also why we must never lose hope.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Jean...
</p><p>Defender! Accused! The trial is about to start. Proceed to the chamber!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-yes, we're coming!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Nick...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Cheer up, Maya! I'm not just going to let them sentence you!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
I just wish all this would stop already. Whether someone's a "witch" or not... no one deserves to be burned!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I know. I can't stand for it either.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............ If you'll kindly excuse me now, I must return to my duties.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ah, no problem. We, uhm, appreciate you coming to see us. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Something's bothering me... Jean seems somewhat odd today.)</span>
</p><p>Espella:<br />
...Let's go, Mr Wright! The trial is about to begin!
</p>
<hr />
<p><i>Witches' Court</i>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ahem... The trial of Maya Fey shall now begin, as scheduled. Knights of the Court, are you ready to cross your swords of justice?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Inquisitor Zacharias Barnham always has his sword ready for the work of justice.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Uhh...defence ready, Your Honour. At this stage, I've just gotta give it all I've got!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
............ It would appear the defender has <span style="color:#E16935">thrown down the gauntlet</span>, Sir Barnham. Now, before we begin...may I have a word with you, defender?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes, Your Honour!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Last time me met, you stood in this court as an apprentice baker. In all honesty, when I saw you for the first time, I thought to myself: "A baker should stick to bread baking."
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Is that so? <span style="color:#0070C0">(What a fine first impression I made...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
However, today you are not merely some befuddled maker of sweet buns. I am obliged to fully recognise you... as a knight of law and justice on par with Inquisitor Zacharias Barnham.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, may your duel begin! Fight bravely and expose the truth behind this heinous crime!
</p>
<center>All right! We're all counting on you, Inquisitor Barnham!<br />I knew she was a witch as soon as I laid my eyes on her! She's got "witch" written all over her!<br />Why not put the baker on trial?! Bake the baker, I say!<br />Barnham! Barnham! Barnham! Barnham!</center>
<p><br />
Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(They treat him like some sort of celebrity...)</span>
</p><p>Espella:<br />
He may be adored by the crowds, but when he pointed his sword my way, you managed to shield me from his accusations! Maya clearly isn't a witch! So surely your victory is certain!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Thank you for believing in me, Espella.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Espella Cantabella...
</p><p>Espella:<br />
......!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
I have given you leave to come to this trial today. However, that does not mean... that the charges against you have been dropped. Rather than worry about others, you should consider your own situation!
</p><p>Espella:<br />
............ Thank you for granting me your permission, Inquisitor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Inquisitor Barnham, you may begin your opening statement.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
As you wish, Milord. As usual, let us commence this trial by first recounting the events. If it pleases you, Sir Blue Knight...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
As, uhm, you wish...Inquisitor. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I still can't get used to this terminology...)</span>
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
This heinous crime occurred in the residence of the late Newton Belduke, the alchemist. Here is the sketched plan of his residence. This room, of a somewhat questionable nature, is the alchemist's study, in which the incident took place. The only ones present at the moment of the crime were the <span style="color:#E16935">accused</span> and the <span style="color:#E16935">victim</span>. No one else. The witnesses, who arrived at the scene seconds later, have indicated where they found the accused and the victim.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. The sketch is accepted as evidence.
</p><p>Floor Plan added to the Court Record.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The accused took Sir Layton's life with the most cruel of magic. A living man one second, a golden statue the next! Such wickedness!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Magic that turns things into gold? ...Sure, why not?)</span>
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Several townspeople rushed to the room and paid witness to the horror of this magic. The accused has been captured and charged.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Goodness, that is terrifying! Rumours have reached me that the victim was a most scintillating man. I'm not quite certain whether it was prior to or after... But incidentally...was this <span style="color:#E16935">Sir Layton</span> not the same <span style="color:#E16935">hat maker</span> who attended our previous trial?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
No, no, he wasn't a hat ma-
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Bizarre as it is... Sir Layton's profession and origin remain unknown. He was a <span style="color:#E16935">stranger</span> in this city... that is all we know.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
And you, sir, his acquaintance... You are an unusual presence in our city yourself.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph. Today's case certainly is peculiar.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
And that is not the last of the peculiarities, Milord. The alchemist's study has been the scene of <span style="color:#E16935">another strange incident</span> in the past...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah yes, I remember it as if it were yesterday. The mysterious death of Newton Belduke himself.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Indeed, Milord. Regrettably, the only case of witchcraft still to remain unsolved in our fair city. The witch may have escaped her punishment back then... but perhaps today is the day on which both these mysterious crimes shall be solved.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What? Wh-what are you implying?!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Patience! You will know soon enough, Sir Suddenly-Pale Blue Knight.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
How interesting. It seems that the inquisition have something up their sleeve. Now, Inquisitor Barnham, you may begin.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Thank you, Milord. The inquisition summons the witnesses to this malicious crime of witchcraft!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If only... If only I'd made it to the room sooner... Maybe I could've prevented all this from happening... I won't let Maya take the rap for this! I'll find every single crack in their testimony and prove it wasn't her!)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Welcome to the Witches' Court, honourable witnesses. Now, let us hear your names and occupations.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
I am known far and wide as Emeer Punchenbaug I, soon to be the new head of Punchenbaug's Retail Organisation, "PRO".
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/42/Shout_tyotto.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170907232845" class="image"><img alt="Shout tyotto.xi uk" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/42/Shout_tyotto.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170907232845" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout tyotto.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_tyotto.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
W-wait a minute, witness!
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
What's that, blue squire?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You're...that guy from the previous trial! Just...what the heck's happened to you? You look like you've been on one of those "ultimate makeover" shows...
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
............ Whatever do you mean? Me name is Emeer Punchenbaug I, soon to be the head of Punchenbaug's Retail Organisation, "PRO".
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Wh-what is the meaning of this, Inquisitor?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
I do not care to delve into this witness' <i>[sic]</i> personal affairs.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Looks like he remembers him all too well...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Witnesses, pray continue.
</p><p>Ms Primstone:<br />
Oh dearie, dearie me. It is I who usually asks the questions... I am, you see, but a humble teacher. Call me Ms Primstone. The children of Labyrinthia Primary School have the privilege of learning the truths about this world from me.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(An elementary school teacher, huh... Good to know at least one witness seems sensible.)</span>
</p><p>Birdly:
</p>
<center>♪The winds carry my song, it's Birdly Stringing along! Parrot and bard, ensemble avant-garde!♪</center>
<p>My faithful muse, here, is Cracker the musical parrot. No one understands music like Cracker. Aside from me, naturally.
</p><p>Cracker:<br />
Oh dearie, dearie me!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(At least it's not another goat...)</span>
</p><p>Espella:<br />
What a smart bird! He just imitated that teacher perfectly!
</p><p>Luke:<br />
I'm Luke Triton. My occupation is... the professor's apprentice!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Luke?
</p>
<center>Luke! But...why?!</center>
<p><br />
Luke:<br />
............
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What are you doing there?
</p><p>Luke:<br />
...I made up my mind. I'm doing this for the professor! A gentleman has to pursue the truth!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But...Luke. That's where the <span style="color:#E16935">inquisition's</span> witnesses stand!
</p><p>Luke:<br />
I...I'll never... I'll never forgive that witch!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A gentleman shouldn't glare at people as if he wants to hit them in the face...)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br />
L-Luke...
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
"Your friend today can be your enemy tomorrow." Such is the hard reality of the battlefield.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Witnesses, we will now hear your testimonies. Tell us all of this wicked incident, which you have been unfortunate enough to witness.
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">- What We Witnessed -</span></center>
<p>Emeer:<br />
I heard a scream and an incantation, and then when I entered the room, the victim was already all shiny!
</p><p>Ms Primstone:<br />
Mayhap something caused discord between erstwhile friends? Mr Silk Hat had a knife at the ready, in his hand!
</p><p>Birdly:
</p>
<center>♪Victim of magic, sparkly and done for, I heard the staff fall on the floor♪</center>
<p><br />
Luke:<br />
The professor must have seen through Miss Maya's deception and confronted her right there, face-to-face!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
I see... Thank you all... However, one part of the testimony was somewhat confusing... You there...the singer...
</p><p>Birdly:<br />
Singer? Could you possibly mean me, Birdly the bard, Your Excellence?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, that would be you, singer. This "staff" that you said...sung about...
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
It is as you suspect, Milord. This very <span style="color:#E16935">witch's sceptre</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Espella:<br />
There are two different magic gems attached, meaning the perpetrator could have used two types of magic.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yeah...it would seem so.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
This gem here enables the use of a <span style="color:#E16935">gold</span> transmutation spell, "<span style="color:#E16935">Goldor</span>".
</p><p>Judge:<br />
"Goldor"... Just the word alone makes the tiny hairs on the back of my neck stand up.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Har har har, that's the one, all right! That's the dreadful incantation that I, Emeer Punchenbaug I, also heard!
</p><p>Ms Primstone:<br />
Oh dearie, dearie me! I have seen that sceptre, so I have!
</p><p>Birdly:
</p>
<center>♪Clank! Tips over the golden man! The sceptre falls. Not the witch's plan!♪</center>
<p><br />
Cracker:<br />
Oh dearie, dearie me!
</p><p>Luke:<br />
How dare she do that to the professor!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
By the way, this witch's sceptre was found on the floor, near the victim. If you'll turn your attention to the sketched plans, it was located right here. A sceptre dropped by the accused would naturally tumble to exactly that spot.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Inquisitor Barnham! What you're saying amounts to nothing more than a baseless assumption!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
You are on edge today, Sir Blue Knight. Is it because your friend is on trial? Perhaps you had better cool yourself down.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Well, anyway. The court accepts the sceptre as evidence.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Thank you, Milord.
</p><p>Talea Magica added to the Court Record.
</p><p>The spell Goldor has been bookmarked in the Grand Grimoire.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Um, Inquisitor Barnham, may I ask you something?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
What is it now, Sir Blue Knight?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
We know that one of the gems is for the spell Goldor, but what about the other one?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
A naive question...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Naivety may be no hindrance to a baker, who spends most of his time amidst bread. But it can be your undoing here in court. Would a knight put a weapon in his enemy's hand?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's telling me to do my homework, huh.)</span>
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Mr Wright! I'll look for information about that magic gem in the Grand Grimoire!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Thank you, Espella. That would be great.
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Just leave it to me!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She seems very happy to help.)</span>

</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Whaddya mean, blue squire?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Your gaudy...uhm...colourful outfit! I mean, your attire was different last time. A little more...modest.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
The Emeer you knew back then is no more! I am a new man now, reborn into the higher echelons of society. *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp*
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What's he drinking? There's a <span style="color:#E16935">skull and crossbones</span> mark on that bottle...)</span>
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Enough idle chatter. The witness heard a <span style="color:#E16935">scream</span> and an <span style="color:#E16935">incantation</span>, is that correct?
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
That's right! It's just like what you said earlier, Inquisitor Barnham! It was the spell "Goldor". And it was, without doubt, the voice of the accused that said it!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm, however...it's rather peculiar. When I saw the accused and the victim together last time... they seemed to be on friendly terms.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The next witness will dispel your doubts, Milord.

Well, Luke? Is that really the truth?

Did you really see the sceptre?
</p><p>Luke:<br />
............ ............ I...I don't know. When the professor turned to gold and collapsed right in front of me, everything seemed to fade to black... And then...I could've sworn I at least <span style="color:#E16935">heard</span> Maya drop the sceptre.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The sceptre was found at the scene of the crime. That is the unavoidable truth. Only the accused could have dropped it!

Luke, you said that you will only believe what you see with your own eyes. But what you think you saw may not be the whole truth.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Huh? What do you mean?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Take a close look at the sketch of the crime scene... At the time of the incident, Professor Layton and Maya were standing here. Now, we have learned from Ms Primstone's testimony <span style="color:#E16935">which way</span> the professor was facing. He was facing this way.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You have testified that the professor confronted Maya <span style="color:#E16935">face-to-face</span>. But looking at the sketch of where they were standing, one thing is clear... There is a contradiction in your testimony!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I will ask you to wait before jumping to conclusions, Inquisitor. Think back to Ms Primstone's testimony... She told us that the professor was <span style="color:#E16935">pointing a knife</span> at someone, threateningly.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
However, you can see in the sketch that he wasn't threatening Maya. So then, who was he pointing the knife at?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Luke...what is it?
</p><p>Luke:<br />
The professor would never point a knife at anyone! I was the one who opened the door to that room, so I was the first witness...and I saw no knife! Miss Primstone's testimony is not reliable!
</p><p>Ms Primstone:<br />
Oh, dearie me! Will you look at this child, sputtering nonsense and talking badly of his elders!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Inquisitor Barnham?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Yes, Milord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It should pose no difficulty to verify whether or not the victim had a knife. After all, that...sparkling golden <span style="color:#E16935">body</span> of his has been found at the scene of the crime, has it not?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............ Indeed it has, Milord. Court attendants! You heard the judge! Bring the <span style="color:#E16935">victim</span> into the courtroom!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Seems like they're going to bring the <span style="color:#E16935">golden statue</span>...*gulp*)</span>

<p><br />
Judge:<br />
So this is the power of the gold transmutation spell. Most spectacular... It looks like the work of the finest artisans!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
I assure you it is the work of no artisans, Milord. By the way, the missing <span style="color:#E16935">arm</span> has not yet been found.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
I...I can't believe this! Professor...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I suppose we should add the victim to the evidence.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The poor professor who, while searching for evidence, became evidence...)</span>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But...it's true that someone else could have been at the crime scene! Look at the sketch! The victim was facing towards <span style="color:#E16935">someone</span>, and that person wasn't Maya!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Sir Blue Knight, your ignorance is no longer even a surprise.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

You do not know what transpired at the crime scene. You think this man was pointing at another person, you say? Let me tell you this. Nearly everyone in this court other than you knows <span style="color:#E16935">what</span> Sir Hat was pointing at.

</p><p>Birdly:
</p>
<center>♪The truth obscured by a twisted ruse, The witch couldn't vanish but did confuse♪</center>
<p><br />
Luke:<br />
It happened because the professor unravelled the mystery behind all these witches...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
The "same magic trick" was used?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
They are referring to an incident from three months ago. Much like this incident, a man lost his life to witchcraft in that very room.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It was the master of that residence, Sir Newton Belduke, the <span style="color:#E16935">alchemist</span>.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
He suffered death by strangulation... <span style="color:#E16935">Finger marks</span> were left on his neck. He had locked himself in his study, and the key was still in his pocket.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In other words, <span style="color:#E16935">no one</span> could have entered that room.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The perpetrator disappeared from a locked room...just like in this case.)</span>
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
A large amount of powdered medicine was spilt all over the floor.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Powdered medicine?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Sir Belduke was an alchemist. He possessed various medicinal concoctions.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Due to the presence of that powder, had anyone entered that room, clear footprints would have remained. Yet there were <span style="color:#E16935">none</span>.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
That's the kind of mystery that the professor would have loved to solve...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thus there were two unnatural circumstances to Sir Belduke's death. The culprit's disappearance from a locked room... and the fact that they appeared not to have walked on the floor. It's almost as if they flew away.
</p><p>Espella:<br />
In other words, it couldn't have been the "Dimere" magic that was used in my case the other day...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Seems like the killer levitated above the floor, strangled Belduke and vanished into thin air...)</span> But what does that have to do with this trial?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
It has been three months since that murder. Despite that, we still haven't been able to find the witch responsible. But now, having eluded us for so long... that witch has finally been brought before this court! We will have justice.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Wh-whaaat?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(No way... Now he thinks Maya killed the alchemist, too. We weren't even here back then... But it's not like I can explain that to him.)</span>
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Well then, why don't you interrogate the witnesses? ...Now that you are aware of the connection between the two murders.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You're talking about Mr Belduke's murder, which took place in a locked room?

Yeah. A real shocker, all right. Everyone was talkin' about it. People don't say this out loud, but y'know, eh? You're thinking it too, eh?

Sir Belduke was a man. Only a woman can be a witch... What's more, witchcraft has nothing to do with alchemy. They're...different. Somehow.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Alchemy is the mysterious art of manipulating the forces of nature. ...Or so it is said.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Would you care to elaborate on that, Ms Primstone?
</p><p>Ms Primstone:<br />
You could say I am a scholar, and my knowledge is vast and diverse. I know a thing or two about witchcraft. Therefore, I have a very good idea of the type of magic that must have been used this time.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The magic behind this mysterious figure that appeared out of nowhere, glided through the air and vanished after making the kill?
</p><p>Ms Primstone:<br />
Indeed, yes. And the witch's sceptre confirms my theory.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
A brilliant deduction. I am honoured to have studied under an excellent teacher such as yourself, Ms Primstone.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She was his teacher? Actually, I guess that kind of explains a lot...)</span>
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Our Occult Crime Analysts have arrived at the same conclusion.
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Mr Wright! I found it! The page about the purple magic gem! The spell's called <span style="color:#E16935">Famalia</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
"Famalia"? What does it do?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The spell <span style="color:#E16935">Famalia</span>, bound within this purple gem, is used to summon a <span style="color:#E16935">familiar</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Familiars appear out of nowhere, glide through the air and vanish when their task is accomplished... They are evil, bloodthirsty spirits used by witches to perform outrageous crimes.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Evil spirits? Are you saying that the witch used a familiar to...
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
It was a familiar that took Sir Belduke's life. And now it has appeared again. Sir Silk Hat was probably trying to ward off the evil spirit with his knife. But what good is a knife against an occult creature? It completed the task given to it by the witch and promptly vanished. Thus bringing us to the conclusion that... Sir Belduke and Sir Silk Hat were both killed by <span style="color:#E16935">the same witch</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Whaaa-whaaaaat?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What an...unexpected turn of events. The two incidents have been shown to be connected... due to the same witch's sceptre having been used in both cases!

Is everything all right, Luke? You seem to be in deep thought about something.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
No, it's not right at all!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Is there something in Ms Primstone's testimony that you'd like to comment on?
</p><p>Luke:<br />
That's what I keep telling you! The professor wouldn't point a knife at anyone!

Dearie, dearie me. What an impertinent child! I'm telling you, I saw a knife. I distinctly saw the glint of a sharp blade!

Oh dearie, dearie me! I'm afraid even I did not notice it!

It is indeed astonishing that the arm could have disappeared from the crime scene.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
The professor will need his arm when he returns to normal! It's an all-out robbery! Go and investigate it!

The boy's request is not unreasonable. I will order our Occult Crime Analysts to search for it.

Pointing a knife, no less. A knife! As I told you before, it was a sharp, glittering knife. The poor man thought a knife would work on a familiar! Had he attended my classes, he would have known better.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
In any case, there's no proof that the victim actually had a knife. <span style="color:#0070C0">(It's certain now that the professor and Maya <span style="color:#E16935">weren't facing each other</span>.)</span>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It's, uhh...a beautiful song, sure. But would you mind testifying in a bit more of a... comprehensible way?
</p><p>Birdly:<br />
As you wish, Sir Musically Impaired Defender. A certain man was killed some three months ago.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You mean Sir Newton Belduke, the alchemist, right?
</p><p>Birdly:<br />
It was a "locked room murder", accomplished through the use of a certain mysterious spell.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And that same magic has been used in this case too.
</p><p>Birdly:<br />
The witch that committed the crime disappeared without a trace.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
She hasn't been found to this day, huh...
</p><p>Birdly:<br />
............ That's pretty much what I expressed in my song.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I knew all that already.

Even a peerless bard such as myself may not always be completely up to date with all the latest information. Isn't that so, Cracker? You understand, don't you, my peerless feathery partner?

I'll tell you! On the day of the crime, Emeer came to my shop... He waltzed up to me saying he'd got his hands on a superb work of art, rare as gold dust!

I think I know where this is going...
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
That "work of art"...could it be...?
</p><p>Price:<br />
I've got it right here.

Just like I thought...
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
That's...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh my...
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Professor... It's the professor's arm!
</p><p>Price:<br />
It's pure gold, exquisitely crafted. It was entitled...hmm..."<span style="color:#E16935">Towards Tomorrow</span>", or something like that. I'd never seen a piece of gold so fine before... And so, suspecting nothing, I paid that rascal a rather handsome sum.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Who would have thought...
</p><p>Price:<br />
And what am I hearing now?! That it was a human arm, no less! You, sir, are a <span style="color:#E16935">monster</span>! You're as bad as a <span style="color:#E16935">witch's familiar</span> yourself!
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
I didn't know it was his arm, I swear! When I saw it, it was already like that!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
I was last to the scene, and it caught me eye right away!
</p>
<center>That golden arm, pointing up at the ceiling with such optimism and authority! I thought, it looks like it's showing me the way to a better, brighter, richer tomorrow!</center>
<p>To me, it was a work of art! A precious one, at that!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And then it found its way into your pocket and you pawned it?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
You mounted it on a crude stand, gave it a tawdry title and passed it off as some kind of a sculpture...
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
............
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Don't try and look away from the truth now!
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Darn it! I can look wherever I darn please! I'll look away from the facts and forward to the future! <span style="color:#E16935">Always look on the bright side</span>!
</p>
<center>That's Emeer Punchenbaug's motto!</center>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Where were we now...ah, yes. The victim's arm has now been successfully reattached by one of our masterful craftsmen. Knights of the Court! You may resume the inquisition.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
At least one thing's clear now... As everyone can see, the victim definitely wasn't holding a knife!
</p><p>Ms Primstone:<br />
Oh dearie, dearie me! It seems I may have been mistaken after all. When you think about it, the victim had already been turned to gold when we entered the room.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
According to the witnesses' testimonies, that was the case, yes.
</p><p>Ms Primstone:<br />
Well then, I'm sure you'll concede that it was easy to mistake that glittering pointing finger for a knife.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Indeed, the victim's finger has a glint to it resembling that of a sword's edge.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Such a sense of power and intensity... It's enough to send a shiver down the spine of anyone being pointed at.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
No puzzle is a match for the power of the professor's pointing finger!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess no one remembers I'm known for pointing like that too...)</span>
</p><p>Espella:<br />
I think your pointing finger makes quite an impression too, Mr Wright!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She's just taking pity on me...)</span>
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Is that all you had to say, Sir Blue Knight?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
As I said before, whether the victim had a knife or not... is completely irrelevant.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Y-yeah, what he said! You'd better apologise to me now! Badgerin' me for no reason like that...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is that all there is to it? Or could that arm hold some other <span style="color:#E16935">clues</span>...?)</span>

We've come this far... Maybe there's something else you could ask about.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She's right. I need to ask some more questions.)</span> Well then, Mr Emeer. Perhaps you could tell me one more thing about that arm.

Very well. Inquisitor Barnham, you may proceed.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
It took us longer than expected, but we have finally managed to ascertain some facts. The defendant attacked the victim using <span style="color:#E16935">two magic spells</span> enabled by the witch's sceptre found at the crime scene. The witnesses each saw the very moment at which the victim turned to gold and collapsed. And then the witch dropped the witch's sceptre.

I believe that was a definitive proof... that there is a contradiction here. Not in the sketch, but rather in this court. That contradiction is you, Sir Blue Knight. Perhaps you had better go back to your bakery.

<p>Phoenix:<br />
The contradiction is right here!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And this is...the <span style="color:#E16935">witch's sceptre</span>...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Let's go over the order of events, as per the witnesses' testimonies. First, the witch cast a spell on the professor, turning him to gold. When all of you rushed to the crime scene, that golden statue fell down, making a loud noise. Next, the witch dropped the sceptre.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
What are you getting at, Sir Blue Knight? All witnesses agree with this order of events.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's right. They all agree that's how it happened... But then there's the arm.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Well, what about it? Spit it out.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Let's assume that Maya was the witch... Now, look at the sketch again. The witch dropped the sceptre after having turned the professor into gold. The sceptre tumbled along the floor... and was found here, as asserted by the prosecution. However, that would be impossible. There's no way it could have been there!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh... I see it now!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Ngh... The...<span style="color:#E16935">arm</span>...it was...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I'm glad you seem to have noticed. The victim's arm was on the floor right here, standing on its end. Therefore, the sceptre couldn't possibly have fallen that way. Ergo, it <span style="color:#E16935">couldn't</span> have been the defendant who dropped the sceptre! In other words, Maya is not a witch!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Nghhhhh!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! Orderrr! How can this be...? The inquisition's reasoning has been proven invalid through just one single piece of unusual evidence!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Call it Layton's magical touch! The professor sacrificed his arm to leave us just the evidence needed to turn this thing around!)</span>

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
An admirable deduction, Sir Blue Knight. ...That I cannot deny. Even if we are to assume your reasoning is correct and that girl in the cage is not a witch...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
"Even if"...?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
in <i>[sic]</i> the many trials I have attended, I have become well-versed in certain aspects of magic. I am all too aware of its potential to confuse people, befuddle their minds and make their memories hazy... No one can resist such a maddening influence.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What are you trying to say, Inquisitor?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The sceptre could not have tumbled across the floor if the arm were in its way. ...However! Can we be sure that is where the arm was? Are all of the witnesses able to confirm its location at the time?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
And yet, no one actually saw the sceptre being dropped. Witnesses. Think back to that incident once more. Did the golden statue fall over first...or did the staff fall before it?

</p><p>Birdly:<br />
I could gladly sing of your adventures if it pleases you, kind sir.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Yeah, that's exactly what I want! Show me what ya've got!
</p><p>Birdly:<br />
Very well. As per your request...
</p>
<center>♪Oh grand Emeer Punchenbaug the First, Will new fortune quench your thirst? Having bravely filched the golden arm, Now you've duped the pawn shop man♪</center>

</p><p>Luke:<br />
It's precisely because Cracker doesn't talk in his own words that he's certain to tell us the truth!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
What?
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Cracker remembers every sound he hears, even just the once, with absolute perfection. So let's have him <span style="color:#E16935">testify</span> exactly what he heard!

And if Cracker can <span style="color:#E16935">repeat</span> every sound... I'd say this should be a valuable testimony!

I cannot believe this is happening...

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
What's this now...?
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Why, those are the sounds of the incident... exactly as Cracker <span style="color:#E16935">heard</span> them!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Ludicrous! Evidently, this is nothing but a farce after all!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What do you mean, Inquisitor Barnham? I must admit I found the parrot's testimony quite impressive.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Even if that bird can accurately recall the sounds... it is clearly useless when it comes to... the <span style="color:#E16935">order</span> of events!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You mean there's a problem with the order?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
First, the witch used magic to turn the victim into gold. Then, the witnesses arrived. It is reasonable to assume they cried out in terror when they did so. And yet, this testimony does not accurately convey such an order of events!
</p>
<center>It starts with a sudden scream. Followed by the door abruptly opening... and then a witness crying out. Next, we hear the victim, having turned into gold, falling down. So far, so reasonable... But the real issue is as follows.</center>
<p>The parrot seems to think the witch cast her spell after the witnesses entered. Such a suggestion is inconceivable! The reason is simple. At that time, the victim had <span style="color:#E16935">already been</span> turned into gold!
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph... Indeed, it is as you say, Inquisitor Barnham.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />

What? Are you serious?! Did you not hear what I said? Are you choosing to ignore MY words?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
A witness that cannot talk cannot lie, either. This parrot's testimony is the naked truth. He's simply <span style="color:#E16935">repeating</span> the sounds as he heard them.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It's humans who make assumptions about the meaning of those sounds and arbitrarily decide whether the testimony's good or not. But, as Knights of the Court, shouldn't we be striving to uncover the truth to which this parrot holds the key?

<p>Espella:<br />
Do you think there's anything important in Mr Cracker's testimony?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Hmm. There does seem to be a fundamental problem with what he repeated... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Why would the incantation come <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> the professor was turned to gold?)</span>
</p><p>Espella:<br />
But Mr Cracker can't tell lies, right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yeah... He can only repeat the sounds he's heard. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Maybe we're just <span style="color:#E16935">misinterpreting</span> Cracker's testimony...)</span> For the time being, let's have another look at the <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record</span> and the <span style="color:#E16935">Grand Grimoire</span>.
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Yes, of course!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
There is a critical <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span> in this testimony!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
We are all aware of that, Sir Blue Knight. This contradiction is between your so-called desire to find the truth and the fact that you are interrogating a parrot!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's not what I'm talking about, Inquisitor. There is a contradiction here that makes one thing particularly clear... the fact that we have clearly all made a <span style="color:#E16935">wrong assumption</span>!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
...How so?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Luke, can you ask Cracker to repeat the <span style="color:#E16935">incantation</span> once more?
</p><p>Luke:<br />
R-right you are!
</p><p>Cracker:<br />
............ ...Godoor! ...Godoor!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
G... "<span style="color:#E16935">Godoor</span>"...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
According to the Grand Grimoire, the name of the gold transmutation spell is "<span style="color:#E16935">Goldor</span>"... Now, Inquisitor, it would seem to me that the spell we've just heard is in fact a <span style="color:#E16935">different one</span> entirely!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well I never... Unbelievable! "<span style="color:#E16935">Goldor</span>" and "<span style="color:#E16935">Godoor</span>"...
</p><p>Barnham:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Cracker is able to <span style="color:#E16935">imitate</span> sounds <span style="color:#E16935">perfectly</span>. The incantation was indeed misheard... but only by the <span style="color:#E16935">people</span> hearing it!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The victim was found already in his golden state. That is proof enough that the <span style="color:#E16935">Goldor</span> spell was used!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But you're forgetting that Cracker heard this incantation <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> that spell had already taken place! Which makes it entirely possible that this "<span style="color:#E16935">Godoor</span>" spell was used as well! In other words, <span style="color:#E16935">another spell</span>, besides the gold transmutation magic, must also have been used!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Nnngh...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A-another spell...that we haven't yet considered?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Now, the next question that needs to be asked is: just what is this <span style="color:#E16935">Godoor</span> spell?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Utter foolishness! This is absurd! As convenient as it would be for you, there is no way that a spell by the name of "<span style="color:#E16935">Godoor</span>" exists!
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Oh! Mr Wright!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh? What is it?
</p><p>Espella:<br />
I've found it. The page about the spell... Godoor. It's listed in the Grand Grimoire...right here!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It...
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
exists? <i>[sic]</i>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wha-whaaaaaaat? Order! Order! I demand order!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Just like I thought. Cracker remembered it exactly.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But then...what kind of magic is this "<span style="color:#E16935">Godoor</span>"?
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Well, Milord...the Grand Grimoire describes it in the following way... Godoor: "Creates a <span style="color:#E16935">portal</span> on two sides of green-coloured walls. The portal will disappear after five minutes".
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Creates a portal?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
On green-coloured walls?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
A portal spell...
</p><p>The spell Godoor has been bookmarked in the Grand Grimoire.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Aren't you a lucky man... It appears even the Grand Grimoire is on your side. However, there is a fatal <span style="color:#E16935">flaw</span> in your explanation.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What...what flaw is that, Inquisitor?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
It is really quite simple. Think back to how the alchemist's study looked at the time of the incident. Do you remember any <span style="color:#E16935">green walls</span>? Because I do not. There were none. All the walls were coated with white plaster. In other words... It was <span style="color:#E16935">impossible</span> to use Godoor in that room!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph... I, too, have visited that alchemist's study since the incident. I remember very well that all the walls in that room were a dull shade of <span style="color:#E16935">white</span>!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Your little theory was interesting, Sir Knight in Blue. But it has proven to be nothing more than that - a mere wild guess. As long as you cannot <span style="color:#E16935">prove</span> that this Godoor spell was used, your little theory shall be considered no further.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In all honesty, I was very surprised to learn of such a spell's existence. However... as long as it was impossible to have used this spell at the crime scene, your deduction leads us nowhere. So let me ask you now.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-yes, Your Honour?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Do you, perchance, have any proof that you could show us? Can you prove that it was feasible for the witch to have used Godoor in that room?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is no coincidence! That spell must have been used at the crime scene! But do I have the proof that it was even <span style="color:#E16935">possible</span> to use Godoor...?)</span>

Sir Blue Knight... I have a question for you. Godoor is a spell used to make portals appear in solid walls, is that correct?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Umm, yeah, that sounds about right...
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Well, fortunately we have several doors here already, so there is no need to resort to magic portals. Now, choose any door you like and leave the court!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Arghhh!

<p>Phoenix:<br />
The walls in the study are coated with white plaster... Not all of them, though. There is just one spot which is green.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh? There is?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I noticed it when investigating the crime scene. You may recall that there was a small painting behind the desk. And for some reason, the wall behind it was painted green.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
It...it was what?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I recall seeing that painting myself, too. If we look at this floor plan... I'd say it was around here.
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Mr Wright, I'll mark it on the floor plan!
</p><p>Floor Plan updated in the Court Record.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It's been bothering me since I saw it. But now it's clear what it was. At the time of the incident, a <span style="color:#E16935">portal</span> opened up behind that painting! In other words, that was the wall utilised for the spell <span style="color:#E16935">Godoor</span>!

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
You're certainly persistent. You just want a <span style="color:#E16935">portal</span> to be there so much, don't you?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The wall behind the painting was green, and that's a fact!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Incidentally, I remember that painting well. It was a small landscape piece. About the size of, say, an open Grand Grimoire.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, it was about that size, indeed. A small, adorable picture.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Even if a portal had opened in that small patch of green... no person would be able to pass through it. In fact, they'd just about be able to put their arm through, at the most. So will you please explain how a witch could possibly have <span style="color:#E16935">escaped</span> through a portal this small?
</p><p>Espella:<br />
He's right, Mr Wright! No one could've got through a portal that small!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Have you anything to say? Or are you so crushed by the realisation of your mistake that words fail you?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............ The portal was too small for a person... It doesn't require much thinking to figure that out.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But that aside, a very obvious question remains. If it wasn't a human, then <span style="color:#E16935">what</span> could've passed through that portal?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
You have put an interesting spin on things. Why don't you <span style="color:#E16935">answer your own question</span>? You talk as if you know everything, so please, enlighten us!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A <span style="color:#E16935">small portal</span> was opened in the wall at the crime scene... And I have all the <span style="color:#E16935">clues</span> as to what that could mean!)</span> What went through the portal was...

There are only two magic gems in this Talea Magica.

Heh, so are you finally forsaking your mistaken assumptions?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I haven't finished, Inquisitor. The fact remains that <span style="color:#E16935">something else</span> could have passed through that portal.

Oh? And just what would that be, Sir Blue Knight?

Wrong assumption?

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
You...you and your crazy theories! Do you even realise what you're saying? If she threw the staff <span style="color:#E16935">into</span> the room, that means...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Exactly. She did it to <span style="color:#E16935">deceive us</span>. Her goal was to make us draw the wrong conclusions. When the incident took place, the witch herself wasn't in the room. She cast the spell from <span style="color:#E16935">outside</span>!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Whaaaaaat?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! Order, I say!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And that's not all. There's even more proof that the staff was thrown into the room from the outside.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Wha...what proof?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That proof is none other than...Professor Layton's <span style="color:#E16935">previously severed right arm</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The victim's arm? How does that prove anything?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
None of the witnesses have testified they saw the witch's sceptre. However... a few of them claim to have <span style="color:#E16935">heard</span> it rattling across the floor.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
That's right.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Please take a look at this floor plan... Since the arm was standing upright here, we know the defendant couldn't have been the one to have dropped the sceptre. Now, think about it...where would you need to drop the <span style="color:#E16935">sceptre</span> from in order for it to end up here?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh...oh!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Ngh...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's right... The sceptre could only have come from the <span style="color:#E16935">small portal</span> created by the spell Godoor!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
This is most unexpected. The witch wasn't in the room when the crime occurred... Or, at least, that's the defence's claim.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It's the only thing that explains all the contradictions we've run into.

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Sir Blue Knight, with that imagination of yours you could aspire to write fantasy stories. A nice try, I must admit. However...this line of assertion is futile! There is a glaring contradiction in your words!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Another "contradiction"? Whatever are you referring to, Inquisitor Barnham?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
This is the Talea Magica that was used in this incident. As we have established, there are two magic gems in it. One for the gold transmutation spell, Goldor, and one for the shadow familiar spell, Famalia. A witch in possession of this staff would not have been able to cast Godoor!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............ Yes...you're absolutely right. But you can't write off all the evidence supporting my theory as mere coincidence.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Why must your agreement always be followed by a "but"?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What I'm getting at is... this Talea Magica...is <span style="color:#E16935">not genuine</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Not genuine</span>...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's right. And naturally, the one responsible for this <span style="color:#E16935">deception</span> is the real culprit of the crime!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Enough of the suspense! It's too much for a man of my age... The defence shall reveal what is meant by this so-called <span style="color:#E16935">deception</span>!

First, I want to clarify one thing. Can we be certain that the Talea Magica in question is authentic?

Without doubt. The metal rod in its centre is called the Spina Magica. The Witch's Mark on its tip is clearly visible and highly detailed. It is impossible to forge, even by the finest craftsmen in all Labyrinthia. I can guarantee you its authenticity.

...! Tha...that's...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Three months ago, when an investigation was carried out into Sir Belduke's death... the results yielded the following conclusion: the spell Famalia had been used to summon a familiar, which in turn carried out the murder.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...And the witch used exactly that to her advantage. Another similar incident at the same crime scene...don't you think that would be the perfect opportunity... for the witch to frame the defendant for her crimes? The defendant would be blamed for both the professor and Sir Belduke's deaths... and she'd be taken for the real <span style="color:#E16935">witch</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />

<p>Judge:<br />
...There is a chapter in the Magic Archive, an old collection of tales of the occult... about the way to test whether or not a magic gem is genuine.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
How can we test it, Milord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It is very simple. A genuine magic gem is composed of a mineral with a density lower than that of pure water. All you need to do is see if the magic gem floats on water.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
That is simple indeed...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
All non-magical minerals in our world, with the exception of sepiolite and a few other special kinds, sink in water. These eerily sparkling magic gems, however, will never sink when put into water. Bailiff! Remove this magic gem for immediate examination!

<span style="color:#0070C0">(The witch turned the professor into a golden statue. And that's not all... She took the life of the alchemist too. And now she's trying to pin the whole thing on Maya... I...I can't just let her get away with that!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, then... Defence, let us hear your theory. Who is this witch responsible for using Godoor and then throwing the sceptre through the resulting portal?

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Psh! What's this about?! You seem to love rolling out these ridiculous suggestions, but you ignore the obvious... Jean Greyerl is <span style="color:#E16935">male</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Inquisitor Barnham, tell me one thing... Is it only <span style="color:#E16935">females</span> who can be witches?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Are you daft?! Of course it's only females!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Never in the history of this court, has there ever been a male witch.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
You're so utterly ignorant! You should be ashamed of yourself!

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
What... What a ludicrous question...

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
At the time of the crime, Jean Greyerl was in the room next to the alchemist's study. And one of the walls in that very room... was <span style="color:#E16935">painted green</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It...it was?

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Inquisitor Barnham! Quickly, have the butler summoned to the court! Have Jean Greyerl brought here immediately!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Certainly, Milord. It shall be done.

</p>

It would seem this trial has turned in a new direction. I think we all need a bit of time to take it in. We shall take a brief intermission. Inquisition, defence...sharpen your swords and wits to prepare yourselves for the next stage of this battle.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes, Your Honour!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
It shall be done, Milord.

</p><p>Maya:<br />
So...it's got to be that, uhm...young butler?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I know what you're thinking. I couldn't quite believe it at first, either. But... The evidence and circumstances all point to the butler. He...or she, has to be the witch. At least... it'll be certain if the magic gem turns out to be a fake.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
............ But if that's the case...then Belduke's murderer was also...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yeah. It would be Greyerl.
</p><p>Espella:<br />
No, it can't be true! He wouldn't have done that!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Espella?
</p><p>Espella:<br />

</p><p>Maya:<br />
Well, you trust us now, right?
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Maya...
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Anyway, Luke, it was thanks to you that we discovered new information.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Thanks to me?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Sure! You got Cracker to testify. That was a great idea! I wish I could talk to animals! Don't you too, Espella?
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Oh, yes. I'd love to have a chat with Eve!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
So, Luke...will you teach us how to do it? Pretty please!
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Uhm, yeah, of course! I can try.
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Yay! That's a promise, right?
</p><p>Luke:<br />
...... Uhm, Mr Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Hmm? What is it, Luke?
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Do you mind if I join you from now on?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Not at all, Luke.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
I realised during the trial... that in this strange town, even what you see with your own eyes may not be real. That's why...I'm not giving up yet! Professor...I know he'll return! We can't give up hope!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
You know, that's what I've been thinking too.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Really?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
I have a feeling he'll reappear again when we get into trouble and help us out. Because, I mean...it's the professor we're talking about here!
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Right!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
And remember what he always says: Look forward to the future! Always look <span style="color:#E16935">on the bright side</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Err...I don't think it was the professor who said that...)</span>

</p><p>Maya:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Let's go. It's time to bring this trial to a close.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Oh... I have something for you, Mr Wright! Here, please take it. Maybe it'll <span style="color:#E16935">come in handy</span> in the trial.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
A letter, huh? Let's see who it's from... Wait... "<span style="color:#E16935">Newton Belduke</span>"? <span style="color:#0070C0">(There are several sheets of parchment inside, but they're all <span style="color:#E16935">blank</span>...)</span>

<hr />
<p><i>Witches' Court</i>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
We will now resume the trial of Maya Fey. First things first, the Occult Crime Analysts have finished examining the evidence... They have tested <span style="color:#E16935">the two magic gems</span> from the witch's sceptre.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
"Goldor floated on the surface of the water, whereas Famalia sank."
</p><p>Espella:<br />
It was said that genuine magic gems <span style="color:#E16935">float in pure water</span>, wasn't it?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thus, it has been established... that the Famalia magic gem is a <span style="color:#E16935">fake</span>! Order! Order! Order in court! This does not prove that <span style="color:#E16935">Godoor</span> was used, of course. Nonetheless... The defence's theory does now seem more plausible. The court considers it worth looking into. ...You have no objection to that, do you, Inquisitor Barnham?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............ No, Milord.
</p><p>Talea Magica updated in the Court Record.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now then, bring in the witness!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Barnham:<br />
Witness, state your name and profession.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
My name is Jean Greyerl. I served the late Master Belduke... Since his death, I have been tending to his dwelling and putting his research materials in order.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm, I don't know what it is, but... I feel like there's something a bit <span style="color:#E16935">different</span> about Greyerl today.)</span>
</p><p>Greyerl:
</p>
<center>............</center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
Witness... There is something we need to clarify first of all. As you are no doubt aware, you have been accused of being a <span style="color:#E16935">witch</span>...
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Therefore, it is vital that you tell us... Are you a boy or a girl?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Please hold on.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Why...what is it?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Excuse my rudeness, Milord, but at this time... I do not intend to answer that question.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Why do you refuse to answer, witness?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I had been following this trial from the gallery and so am fully aware of the utterly absurd accusations made against me. Alchemy, the art pursued by Master Belduke, is concerned with the rules and logic that govern nature. As someone who had been helping Master Belduke for quite some time, I dare say your theory is both illogical and impossible.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The witch's sceptre was thrown into the crime scene through a portal, created by the magical spell Godoor. That portal could only have been opened from your room. And what's more...one of the walls in your room is painted green!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I believe anyone is free to paint their walls in whichever colour they please. Besides... your theory relies on one magic gem being a fake. While that may have been proven true, another question has arisen... where could the <span style="color:#E16935">genuine</span> magic gem be?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...! It...it must have been swapped with the fake one and discarded somewhere...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I'm afraid that's <span style="color:#E16935">impossible</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Why?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
If we assume, as you have claimed, that the witch used the spell Godoor... that would mean the magic gem must have been swapped <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> creating the portal. So tell me, <span style="color:#E16935">when</span> and <span style="color:#E16935">where</span> would the witch have disposed of the magic gem?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
I see your point. Several people paid witness to the incident, and the Knights of the Inquisition arrived at the scene immediately after. During that time, no one left the building and the whole place was meticulously searched.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Naturally, my room was searched as well. Although there was not much to see, as I have few personal belongings.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Despite our inspection, nothing resembling a magic gem was found. I assure you, we have not overlooked anything. I would swear to it on my honour as a knight.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
So, Mr Wright. If you wish to accuse me of being a witch... should you not first prove that there is a connection between <span style="color:#E16935">me</span> and this missing magic gem? Furthermore, I would appreciate it if you could please approach the matter in a <span style="color:#E16935">rational</span> way, like an alchemist.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The house was searched very soon after the crime... If the gem wasn't found, then it means Greyerl <span style="color:#E16935">hid</span> it somewhere. Somewhere the Knights of the Inquisition would <span style="color:#E16935">not have looked</span>. Where could it be?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The witness has made a valid argument. How will the defence respond?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............ The knights who searched Sir Belduke's premises weren't looking for a magic gem. That's why...there is a certain place they <span style="color:#E16935">didn't consider searching</span>.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Interesting. You really don't give up easily, do you? In that case, perhaps you could tell us all where the magic gem is!

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
I told you before... Every nook and cranny of that room has been searched... I can assure you of that, as the head of the Knights of the Inquisition. Why don't you commit my confident words to your memory, Sir Blue Knight?

Ark! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Okay, it's not Johnny Smiles we're talking about here. They actually did a good job...)</span>

He seems pretty certain that the search was done thoroughly!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yeah, you're right... <span style="color:#0070C0">(And yet the witch managed to hide the gem where she knew the knights <span style="color:#E16935">wouldn't look</span>. I think...I might just have an idea as to where that might be.)</span>

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
I told you before... Every nook and cranny of that room has been searched... I can assure you of that, as the head of the Knights of the Inquisition. Why don't you commit my confident words to your memory, Sir Blue Knight?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ark! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Okay, it's not Johnny Smiles we're talking about here. They actually did a good job...)</span>
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Sir Barnham does look rather confident.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
He seems pretty certain that the search was done thoroughly!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yeah, you're right... <span style="color:#0070C0">(And yet the witch managed to hide the gem where she knew the knights <span style="color:#E16935">wouldn't look</span>. I think...I might just have an idea as to where that might be.)</span>
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Sir Blue Knight, I see there's still a faint glimmer of hope in your eyes. Perhaps you can come up with a better answer next time.

Witness... We met for the first time at Sir Belduke's premises. At that time, you had an <span style="color:#E16935">amethyst</span> attached to your collar.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, that's right. Mr Greyerl always wears that gemstone.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Alchemists believe that amethysts emit positive energy.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Amethysts...are purple...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But when I saw you in the waiting room this morning... The gemstone you were wearing was <span style="color:#E16935">green</span>, not purple.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So my question now is...where has it gone? Where is that amethyst... that you supposedly "always" wear?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Wait...wait just a minute! The witness wears a <span style="color:#E16935">purple</span> gemstone?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Is something amiss, Inquisitor Barnham?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............ When we arrived at the crime scene, the witness came out to meet us... I recall the witness wearing a gemstone... but that gemstone was <span style="color:#E16935">green</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Green? Amethysts aren't green. Although amateurs sometimes mistake prasiolite for amethyst. But that's irrelevant now...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Witness. You've been trying to pin the blame on the defendant. In order to do that, you <span style="color:#E16935">replaced</span> the Godoor magic gem with a regular gemstone.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............
</p><p>Judge:<br />
We thought the witch who killed Sir Belduke had used the spell Famalia. You knew that if a witch's sceptre with the Famalia and Goldor magic gems attached was discovered at the crime scene... the suspect would be accused of committing both crimes. And that's precisely what happened. The girl captured at the crime scene was accused of slaying both Sir Belduke and Sir Layton.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That was your plan. You removed the <span style="color:#E16935">Godoor</span> magic stone from the sceptre and inserted your amethyst in its place. And then...you attached the Godoor gem to your collar!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
That's why, when we saw you shortly after the incident, you were wearing a <span style="color:#E16935">green</span> gemstone. To think...that was in fact a <span style="color:#E16935">magic gem</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order! ...Witness, is that true?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............ This amounts to nothing more than conjecture. I do not believe you have any solid proof. However... I have to concede that you have surmised a logical connection between me and the missing magic gem. Consequently...I am prepared to answer your questions.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Good. I will repeat what I asked you previously. Witness. State your name, profession and finally, your gender.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
...My name is Jean Greyerl. I have been serving the late Master Belduke. As you can see, I wear a butler's outfit... but the truth is as the defence claims. I am...a <span style="color:#E16935">girl</span>.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
A <span style="color:#E16935">girl</span>... Unbelievable...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What?! The butler is a girl?! O-order! Order! Order in the court! Jean Greyerl... Are you declaring to this court that you are, in fact, female?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Yes.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
B-but...everyone in town was under the impression that you are a boy...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............
</p>
<center>Eh, did you hear that? The butler's a girl! Doesn't that make him...er, her a maid?<br />I knew there was something suspicious about him... I mean, her!<br />You know why, right? Think about it. All that alchemy...that's mighty suspicious.</center>
<p><br />
Greyerl:<br />
...Just listen to them. Listen to the wild gossip and accusations. Alchemists pursue knowledge of the rules that govern nature. But to the townspeople...alchemy is no different to magic. Had they known I was a girl, they would have taken me for a <span style="color:#E16935">witch</span>. That's what Master Belduke was worried about. He told me it would be safer to pretend to be a boy.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
In other words... you disclose that you're a female, but deny that you're a witch?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............ I would have thought that was obvious.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She knew that once her gender came into question, she wouldn't have been able to conceal it. That's why she made this public now. It was the most <span style="color:#E16935">rational</span> choice for her...)</span>
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Inquisitor Barnham, may I ask you one question? Has all the evidence in this "Golden Gentleman" case already been presented?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Why do you ask?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
As it stands, you do not have a single piece of evidence proving that I am a witch. Given the lack of pertinent evidence against me, I would like to be permitted to return to my duties.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph... What say you, Inquisitor Barnham?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............ It has been proven that the two gems were swapped. However, it may also have been possible for the accused to have done so.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Maya had no <span style="color:#E16935">reason</span> to swap the gems!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
This is a place of judgement. There is no need for us to understand the reasons behind a criminal's actions.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
After all, those whom we judge are other-worldly creatures...they are witches. It is impossible for a human being to understand the reasoning of a witch.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Is there nothing we can do? At this rate, Maya will be...

Your Honour. What this witness needs to testify about is <span style="color:#E16935">not</span> the professor's unfortunate incident... but rather, the incident from three months ago. Namely, Sir Belduke's death. As she was present in the building at the time, working as a live-in butler, she needs to testify about the events of that day!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
About Sir Belduke's death?!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The fact that one of the magic gems was swapped leads me to a single conclusion. Both crimes, the murder of Sir Belduke and the transmutation of the professor, were the work of <span style="color:#E16935">the same witch</span>. The truth behind the alchemist's death may also hold the <span style="color:#E16935">answer</span> to this case!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph... What is your opinion on this, Inquisitor Barnham?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............ I'll allow you to have your way this time, Sir Blue Knight. The inquisition has no objections.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Inquisitor Zacharias Barnham... It seems you have lost that unyielding attitude so admired by the townspeople. Here you are now, letting a novice defender lead you by the nose... It is hard to believe you have been known as the "Unwavering Sword of Justice", for your usually cool-headed judgement...
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
You know little about me, witness. Do you think I care about defending my name? It is this town that I wish to defend.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Sir Belduke's murder is the only case to have remained unsolved for so long. Jean Greyerl, you shall now testify about it!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
As demanded by both the defence and inquisition... the witness will testify about Sir Belduke's death. Any questions?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
No, Milord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I must, however, mention one more thing before we begin. If it cannot be proven that Jean Greyerl is a witch, as claimed by the defence... the court will irrevocably consider Maya Fey to be the witch responsible for both crimes. Is that understood?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
You have no choice, Sir Blue Knight. If you don't want the trial to end right now, ready your sword and face the challenge that awaits.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............ The defence accepts the conditions. Let's proceed with the trial.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Hmph...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Inquisitor Barnham, you may begin.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
We shall start with a brief summary of the incident. About three months ago, in the dead of night, Sir Belduke, the alchemist, was murdered. The crime took place in his study, just as with this incident. The room had been locked from the inside. The victim was found still seated in the chair at his desk, so we can assume he was attacked while working. There were very clear strangulation marks visible on his neck.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh... There's something trickling down from his mouth. Is that <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span>?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Yes, most likely. The victim probably bit his tongue as he was struggling with his assailant.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And you said earlier that some <span style="color:#E16935">white powder</span> was spilled all over the floor, correct?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Yes. Hence, we expected to find the killer's <span style="color:#E16935">footprints</span>. However, <span style="color:#E16935">there were none</span>. The killer must have somehow approached the victim without stepping on the floor. After murdering Sir Belduke, the killer left the room without opening the door.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Undoubtedly, the crime must have been committed with the use of <span style="color:#E16935">witchcraft</span>.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The body was discovered the following morning by the butler...Ms Greyerl.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The body was found by <span style="color:#E16935">Greyerl</span>, huh...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Inquisitor Barnham. The Court Illustrator's sketches will be added to the evidence.
</p><p>Crime Scene Sketches added to the Court Record.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, witness. Begin your testimony. Tell us about the events spanning the night of the crime, from the evening beforehand until you discovered the body.

<p>Greyerl:<br />
At around 1 o'clock at night, I excused myself and left Master Belduke in his study.<br />
When I called him for breakfast in the morning, he did not respond. The door to his study was locked.<br />
A neighbour had come for a visit just then, so we forced the door open together.<br />
All the potions and other concoctions from the study have been confiscated. I wonder if they're being properly stored...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
"Potions and concoctions" were confiscated?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The victim was an alchemist, after all. We were hoping the items confiscated from his study could provide some clues. Besides, such things must not fall into the wrong hands. It may not be standard practice, but it was deemed necessary. The confiscated goods are stored in our secret vault. The only person with access to them is the High Inquisitor, Lady Darklaw.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
It has caused me great difficulty, as I have not been able to put Master's research materials in order as a result.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The confiscated items shall be returned as soon as Sir Belduke's murder is resolved.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............ I shall be looking forward to that.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Defence, you may begin the interrogation!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So you last saw him alive at 1am, is that correct?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
...Yes. Master had a habit of conducting his experiments at night, so it was the usual time for me to finish my work.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Weren't you helping him with those experiments?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
He would sometimes have some errands for me, but alchemists generally keep their experiments a secret. That's why I would always excuse myself at that time, unless Master had some other tasks for me.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
And that night there was no more work for you?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
...That's correct. I wished Master a good night as I shut the door behind me and then heard him lock the key. There was nothing unusual about him. At least, nothing I noticed.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And what time was that?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Master would always take his breakfast at 9am, so it was around that time.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
So you didn't have the key to Sir Belduke's study...is that correct?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Yes. There is only one key to that room and Master always kept it with him. Master's research was a...very delicate matter, you see. We had to take strict measures to prevent outsiders from entering that room. Occasionally, delinquents would try to make off with one or other of Master's medicaments.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Wait, you mean you broke the door?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The only key to that room was in Sir Belduke's pocket. The only way to enter the study was to break the door open.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And you managed that with the help of a neighbour who came to visit?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />

Master Belduke had been making very potent medicines, among other things. We would get people coming from the town at all hours of the day or night asking for them. And yet, in return for all the help Master offered, people would gossip about him dabbling in witchcraft...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Err... So you broke the door together with a neighbour?

Yes. When I explained the situation to him, he brought over an axe. Then he proceeded to attack the door with great force, smashing it into splinters.

No. Not a single thing. Even though many of those were personal items with no relevance to the crime.

Indeed. Alchemy is highly beneficial to the townspeople, even if they fail to notice it.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
It may be beneficial, but it also inspires fear. People fear what they do not understand. At any rate, I cannot return the items to you until Sir Belduke's case is solved. That is what High Inquisitor Darklaw has decided.

And the confiscated goods are being kept in a secret vault by the Knights of the Inquisition?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Um, yeah. How can I put it...? It's pretty obviously contradictory.

<p>Phoenix:<br />
There's something you don't seem to understand here, Mr Emeer. The <span style="color:#E16935">Famalia</span> gem in this witch's sceptre is a <span style="color:#E16935">fake</span>. The gem is <span style="color:#E16935">useless</span>.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Just like this buffoon's testimony.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Therefore, your testimony doesn't <span style="color:#E16935">hold water</span>.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Just like anything else he says. Pssh.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Wha... What?!
</p><p>Birdly:
</p>
<center>♪Ignored and scorned, without credibility, Will majestic Emeer now show humility?♪</center>
<p><br />
Emeer:<br />
............ Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! A faaaaaaaaaake?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
You should have listened to the trial more carefully!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now that has been dealt with... Inquisitor Barnham. This witch's sceptre was not discovered at the crime scene when Sir Belduke was murdered, is that correct?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Indeed. We deduced that Famalia must have been used, however.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But, that Famalia magic gem was a <span style="color:#E16935">fake</span>. That much has been demonstrated today! What's more, as we've learned from Cracker the parrot's testimony... the witch used the spell <span style="color:#E16935">Godoor</span>! The fact that there's a green wall at the crime scene corroborates that!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
That wall may well not have been painted green three months ago! And besides...no one could have passed through a portal so small!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph... To be honest, I've started wondering. Were Sir Layton's and Sir Belduke's murders... actually committed by the same witch?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Your Honour, I'd like to remind you that was the inquisition's claim!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's right, though... It's got to be the same culprit in both cases!)</span> And...at the very least... it's <span style="color:#E16935">possible</span> that the witch used the spell Godoor to commit Sir Belduke's murder.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Wh-what!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In that case, I will ask the defence to show us proof. Do you have proof that the witch could have used Godoor to kill Sir Belduke?

I'd like you to take a look at these.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Aren't those... the Court Illustrator's sketches?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
As you can see from this sketch, the victim was seated at his desk when he was murdered. And <span style="color:#E16935">what</span> can you see right behind the victim?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
...A small landscape painting...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Thank you, Inquisitor. But there's one more point of note... Look closely at the painting. Do you notice...anything behind it?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh...oh! I see it! The wall behind it had already been painted green! Which means the witch <span style="color:#E16935">could have</span> used the portal spell there three months ago!

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
One moment, Milord! Consider how small that portal would've been! Could a witch have passed through it? I think not!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest?cb=20170905153715" class="image"><img alt="Shout igiari.xi uk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="156" data-image-name="Shout igiari.xi uk.png" data-image-key="Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/a8/Shout_igiari.xi_uk.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20170905153715" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Of course, the witch would not be able to go right through it. However... if you look at the distance between the portal and the victim, you'll notice... that the victim, Sir Belduke, was sitting just an arm's length from where the portal would have been!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The witch did not have to enter the room at all! All she had to do was reach through with her arms in order to strangle Sir Belduke, who was sitting right under the painting!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Inquisitor Barnham, what say you to that?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
A fascinating theory, Sir Blue Knight. But there is a notable <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span> within it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Where would that be?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Tell me, why do you think we concluded that Famalia had to have been used? We had a certain reason for it, of course.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And...what was that reason, exactly?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The crime scene had been <span style="color:#E16935">tampered with</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
How so?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Imagine the circumstances of Sir Belduke's death, and it should become obvious, even to you. The victim was choked to death. And yet there were no signs of a struggle. <span style="color:#E16935">Highly improbable</span>, don't you think?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What are you getting at?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Think about it. Can you imagine anyone just sitting back and letting themselves be strangled? Clearly there should be <span style="color:#E16935">evidence of a struggle</span>! And since we haven't found any, that must mean the killer <span style="color:#E16935">erased</span> all <span style="color:#E16935">traces of a fight</span> from the crime scene.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I-indeed! That would be the logical conclusion!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Now, surely it would be impossible to do any such thing, had the witch only reached inside through a portal. In order to cover up the evidence she left behind, the witch had to have used a <span style="color:#E16935">familiar</span>. Without doing so, there would have been no point in her using the spell Godoor!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ms Greyerl could have done it... She might have been able to tamper with the crime scene.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
What are you talking about?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The morning of the crime... from the time Ms Greyerl and that guy entered the study... until the arrival of the Knights of the Inquisition... There was a <span style="color:#E16935">window of time</span> in which she had the opportunity to do so. We need to look into <span style="color:#E16935">what happened in that window</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It seems we may be in need of another testimony. Witnesses, testify about what happened in the time between the body being found and the Knights of the Inquisition arriving.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Before you smashed the door... did you check that it was really locked?
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
'Course I did! We tried to get it open without resorting to brute force, but it wouldn't budge. So I went to fetch me lovely li'l axe.

</p><p>Emeer:<br />
So then I went inside. The alchemist was slumped in his chair.

While we're at it, allow me to confirm something. When you entered the room... did the victim look the way he does in this sketch?
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Yep, that's it! Spot on! Nicely drawn, too! Y'know, at first I didn't know if he was really dead. He looked like he just passed out or somethin', tired from his research. That apprentice of his is real good. To be able to tell at a single glance that the alchemist was done for!

Ms Greyerl... May I ask you something?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Yes, what is it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What do you think about Mr Emeer's testimony?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
There's nothing amiss. However, Mr Wright... I can tell what you are thinking.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You...can? Well, let's see if you're right.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
When he entered the room, Mr Emeer didn't notice that Master Belduke was dead. On the other hand, I ran straight away to call the Knights of the Inquisition. And so... you suspect that <span style="color:#E16935">I knew beforehand</span> that Master was dead. That's what you're thinking. Your face is like an open book.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............ But, isn't that what actually happened?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
No. I knew something was wrong because Master had very fine manners and would never sleep in his chair. When I saw him like that, I was struck with a very bad realisation. I felt certain that something terrible had happened.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph. I have heard about you... The word is that you're very collected and perceptive. It would seem to be the case.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It would be more appropriate to call her calculating.)</span>
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />

That matters not, witness. Let us proceed with the cross-examination.

Are you sure the butler didn't enter the crime scene?
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Yeah! Like I said, he didn't set foot in that room. I went in and sorta didn't know what to do, but the butler sussed out the situation in the blink of an eye. He told me to stand guard...an' then he ran out.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
She went to call the Knights of the Inquisition, is that correct?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
That's correct. I went to the nearby garrison.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
We have the records of when the crime was reported. They match the witness' <i>[sic]</i> testimony.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I returned to Master Belduke's house with two knights. They began an investigation immediately, taking away Master's research materials and concoctions... In the end, I wasn't able to enter that room that day.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
There can be no doubt about it. As he...she is the alchemist's apprentice, she was under close observation following the incident.

I wasn't aware of that.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Even she can be caught off guard...if I choose the right moment.)</span> You have been listening to Mr Emeer's testimony, haven't you?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Yes. I have.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
He was asked to <span style="color:#E16935">look for something</span>. It was you who asked him, I assume. What did you tell him to look for?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............ I think you're mistaken. I don't remember making any request of that sort.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Oi, Bluey! Were you even listening to what I said? It was a <span style="color:#E16935">lady</span> that asked me. The butler is a <span style="color:#E16935">guy</span>, you numbskull! Hey...what's up? Why's everyone lookin' at me like that?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Quite a while ago, we learned... that the butler, Jean Greyerl, is actually <span style="color:#E16935">female</span>.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Wha...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's why, when you said a <span style="color:#E16935">lady</span> asked you to search for something, we assumed it was Ms Greyerl.

Oh, I'm Lettie. Hang on a minute, I'll get down there post-haste!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But...Miss Lettie, who are you, precisely?
</p><p>Mailer:<br />
Me? Who am I? I'm Lettie Mailer. I'm the courier.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The courier?)</span>
</p><p>Espella:<br />
A courier is a person who collects and delivers letters. Or packages.

I know... Thanks anyway, Espella. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I wish she'd stop misreading my mind...)</span>
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Hold on, Ms Mailer. Do you mean it was you who irresponsibly made such a request to that troublemaker?
</p><p>Mailer:<br />
Me? Maybe. Yes. I guess so. I asked him to help me <span style="color:#E16935">find something</span>.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Outrageous! Why was I not informed of this?!
</p><p>Mailer:<br />
Hmm. I guess no one told you...maybe because you didn't ask?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Grrrrrrr... Nghhhh...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It seems we will need to ask you to testify, Miss Mailer. Explain to us how you were involved in this case.
</p><p>Mailer:<br />
Frankly, I wouldn't say I was "involved" in anything. Hmm...now I'm in a tight spot. I bet it's because that guy said something weird about me.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Har har har har har! Ease up on me, lady. Like the saying goes... "<span style="color:#E16935">If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' you with me</span>". Beats bein' in a pickle all on yer own, eh? *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp*

That night... Probably about 1am. I made a delivery to Sir Belduke.<br />
He was writing a letter at the time. "It'll be ready soon, so come pick it up tomorrow morning." That's what he said.<br />
I left his study and wished the butler a good night. Then I went home.<br />
I went there again the next morning, as promised. Sir Belduke was... Well anyway, I looked for the letter.<br />
Then that guy went out like a light on the couch. I got a little scared. So I left as soon as I found the letter.

<p>Judge:<br />
Hmph... I see, I see. So you witnessed the victim write the letter?

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, of course. I understand.
</p><p>Mailer:<br />
Frankly, I didn't get close enough. To Sir Belduke's desk, I mean. So I couldn't make out what he was writing.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In any case, where did you find the letter the morning after the victim was found dead?
</p><p>Mailer:<br />
Uhm... On a shelf. Next to his desk. In a small <span style="color:#E16935">letterbox</span>. Ah, yes! Right there. Next to his head. I was a teeny little bit scared, though. Coming so close to a dead man.

That's pretty late to be making a delivery.

Look, he's an alchemist. He gets loads of strange packages. That's why. He'd often order various implements from the glass craftsman. Or have someone gather wild herbs for him. He usually carried out his experiments at night. So, yeah. He often needed items delivered in the middle of the night.

What do you mean by "<span style="color:#E16935">usual drink</span>"?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
When Master's experiments continued into late hours, he would always have some juice to ward off sleepiness.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What kind of juice?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Tomato juice. He'd have one bottle every night. It was my daily routine to bring it to him before withdrawing to my room for the night.

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Oh, you didn't... Surely even you wouldn't!
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Well, like I told ya before... I think I sorta overdid it a bit the previous night... When I woke up, me head was poundin'. That's why I went to see the alchemist. But you know what happened. And when I was left alone in the alchemist's study... it kinda caught me eye. The bottle, I mean.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The tomato juice...
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
I thought it might make the headache go away, y'know...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So you...you drank it? The juice found at the crime scene?!
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Well, why shouldn't I? It's a drink, ain't it? What else do you do with a drink? You drink it, right?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
It has been confiscated.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Confiscated?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
As I mentioned previously... The Occult Crime Analysts confiscated all of Master's personal belongings from the crime scene.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Is that so? Well, I believe we should take note of that bottle and add it to the Court Record.
</p><p>Tomato Juice Bottle added to the Court Record.

Yeah, so, there I was, havin' a bit of juice, when that girl came round.

Yes. I did. Master Belduke thanked me, as always, and then I left him.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ms Greyerl, I have to ask you again... Why have you kept this information from the court until now?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............ Please accept my sincere apologies. It was such an obvious part of my daily routine that it didn't even occur to me to mention it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You want us to believe that you simply forgot to tell us?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
That would match the evidence found at the crime scene. I do remember seeing an uncorked bottle of tomato juice there.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Mr Wright! Please take a look at this! It's here in the Court Illustrator's sketch too.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So it is. That Court Illustrator certainly does pay attention to the details...)</span>
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Then, that would mean... the red liquid trickling down from the victim's mouth is not, in fact, <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span>. It is <span style="color:#E16935">tomato juice</span>. I think we can safely make that assumption.

Poor Master...

That would be the same juice you drank at the crime scene, stealing from a dead man, would it not?

Maybe it's worth looking into the <span style="color:#E16935">reason</span> behind that drowsiness. What could have made him suddenly pass out and sleep like a log in a dead man's room?
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Oh! I think I know what it might have been!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's right, Luke. There's a certain piece of evidence that might be related here. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I suppose I should <span style="color:#E16935">present</span> that evidence and test out my little theory.)</span>
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Let's try it, Mr Wright!
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
Mister, I believe the reason you might have lost consciousness at the crime scene... is tied to a certain <span style="color:#E16935">piece of evidence</span>.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
But wasn't it just because, y'know, I had a bit too much fun the night before?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
No. It was because of...this!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The tomato juice?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You passed out right after drinking this juice. Therefore, it's not unreasonable to assume that there's a <span style="color:#E16935">direct connection</span> between the two.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Tomato juice does not make people fall unconscious, Sir Blue Knight.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Exactly. That's why <span style="color:#E16935">something</span> must have been added to the contents of that bottle! Something like...a <span style="color:#E16935">soporific</span>!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
...!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Y-you mean, sleep medicine?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And if a soporific was mixed in with the tomato juice... that means Sir Belduke would have been <span style="color:#E16935">unconscious</span> at the time he was assailed!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh! Oooooooh! Th-this sketch! Have another look. The red liquid trickling down from the victim's mouth... is proof that Sir Belduke must have drank the <span style="color:#E16935">tomato juice</span>!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
I...I had failed to consider this...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Inquisitor Barnham, I bet you remember saying this to the court: "Can you imagine anyone just sitting back and letting themselves be strangled? Clearly there should be evidence of a struggle! And since we haven't found any, that must mean the killer erased all traces of a fight from the crime scene." However! If the victim was unconscious when his assailant was strangling him... then the killer could have committed the crime through a <span style="color:#E16935">small portal</span>, big enough to put their arms through, after all!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
That may be so, but tell me this: how would the culprit have managed to obtain such a strong soporific? ...Arghhh...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It was very simple. And I think you've realised why.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
From the <span style="color:#E16935">alchemist</span>...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's right. An alchemist would no doubt have a wide array of various medicaments in their possession. And an apprentice would have little trouble stealing some of them from their study. Isn't that right...Ms Greyerl?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............ How should I respond to that... "I'm sorry to disappoint you" may perhaps be the best way to put it.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-what do you mean...?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Even though that juice bottle has been safely stored for the past three months... I'm positive it would be impossible to find any traces of that soporific now.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
...You... You wicked...
</p>
<center>...This is unbelievable... ...Was it really the butler who did it...?<br />...But everything she says holds true...<br />...She was pretending to be a boy! That's mighty suspicious to start with...<br />...Is she...a witch...?</center>

Hold on, everyone! The butler couldn't have done that to Sir Belduke! He...she would never, ever do it!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Mailer:<br />
Please! Let us testify just one more time! Miss Greyerl, let's tell them! Let's prove they're wrong! They have no idea how much you've done for Sir Belduke!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Miss Mailer...

Very well. I shall grant your request. Testify about the relationship between Miss Greyerl and Sir Belduke.

Master took me in, a complete stranger. I will forever be indebted to him.<br />
That's why I could never make an attempt on his life, through magic or otherwise.
</p><p>Mailer:<br />
Sir Belduke was a wonderful man! He's the one who recommended this line of work to me.<br />
And he's the one who told me about it. The confidentiality obligation, I mean. I've never once broken it!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
It's true that Sir Belduke evoked fear due to his being an alchemist... However, he was also a man of admirable character, who supported the townsfolk through his research. Why would anyone want to kill such a man? This question keeps haunting me...however much I think about it.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Witches need no reason behind their evil. That is what makes them witches.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
How long has it been since you began serving Sir Belduke?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I suppose it would be five years now. Before that, I'd lost everything. I had nothing and nobody left in this world.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You lost everything?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
That's when Master Belduke helped me. He kindly took me in and gave me work.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(What did she go through before she started working for Belduke?)</span>
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You're claiming you had no reason to kill Sir Belduke...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Yes. You can ask whomever you wish, and I'm sure they will say the same.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
That is so. It is widely known that Jean Greyerl was devoted to serving Sir Belduke. It's difficult to imagine that she could brutally murder her respected master.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed, I am of the same opinion. I have visited Sir Belduke on several occasions, to enquire about this piece of evidence or that... and I must say I felt there was a strong bond of trust between him and Miss Greyerl.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ms Greyerl had no reason for wanting to kill Sir Belduke.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
However, there was <span style="color:#E16935">another incident</span> that night, which is related to this case... And I have an idea what it was.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
"Another incident"?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I'm referring to this letter. Sir Belduke wrote a letter shortly before his death, yet all we have here are some blank sheets of parchment.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Fascinating. Are you saying maybe a witch used some kind of ink-removing magic on that letter, Mr Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
No. The spell used by the witch was, of course, Godoor.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Let's go over the state of the crime scene one more time. As we know from Ms Mailer's testimony... the letter was in a <span style="color:#E16935">letterbox</span> next to the victim's head.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah yes, it's in the sketch as well. The letterbox is on the far side of the shelf.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The point of note is the <span style="color:#E16935">location</span> of that letterbox.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
U-unbelievable!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
As Inquisitor Barnham seems to have noticed, the letterbox is <span style="color:#E16935">within reach</span>... of the small portal conjured by the witch, behind the painting on the wall.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, indeed it is!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And, as Sir Belduke's butler... you would have known exactly <span style="color:#E16935">where</span> he keeps his letters!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............ Indeed, Master Belduke would always keep his letters... in that letterbox, before posting them.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
You...you mentioned no such thing!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ms Greyerl! You created a portal with Godoor... not with the intention of killing Sir Belduke. You were after this <span style="color:#E16935">letter</span>, weren't you?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
That's...merely wild conjecture. I didn't even know about that letter at the time!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You didn't? Now that's very strange.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
When Ms Mailer came by that night, Sir Belduke was busy writing that letter. And that's when you entered. Carrying a bottle of tomato juice.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
There's no way you wouldn't have known that you master was writing a letter to someone! And you could've known even more than that... For instance, perhaps you knew what <span style="color:#E16935">he was writing about</span>.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
That's enough! I served Master Belduke as his butler. I never would have pried into his private affairs! Whatever it was he wrote about in his final letter to the Storyteller... it is no concern of mine!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............ Your Honour.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, defence?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I'd like Ms Greyerl's last statement to be added to her testimony.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph. Any objections, Inquisitor Barnham?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............ No, Milord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. Witness, include what you just told us in your testimony!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
As you wish, Milord.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ms Greyerl had no reason for wanting to kill Sir Belduke.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
However, there was <span style="color:#E16935">another incident</span> that night, which is related to this case... And I have an idea what it was.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
"Another incident"?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I'm referring to this letter. Sir Belduke wrote a letter shortly before his death, yet all we have here are some blank sheets of parchment.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Fascinating. Are you saying maybe a witch used some kind of ink-removing magic on that letter, Mr Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
No. The spell used by the witch was, of course, Godoor.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Let's go over the state of the crime scene one more time. As we know from Ms Mailer's testimony...the letter was in a <span style="color:#E16935">letterbox</span> next to the victim's head.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah yes, it's in the sketch as well. The letterbox is on the far side of the shelf.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The point of note is the <span style="color:#E16935">location</span> of that letterbox.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
U-unbelievable!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
As Inquisitor Barnham seems to have noticed, the letterbox is <span style="color:#E16935">within reach</span>...of the small portal conjured by the witch, behind the painting on the wall.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, indeed it is!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And, as Sir Belduke's butler...you would have known exactly <span style="color:#E16935">where</span> he keeps his letters!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............ Indeed, Master Belduke would always keep his letters...in that letterbox, before posting them.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
You...you mentioned no such thing!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ms Greyerl! You created a portal with Godoor...not with the intention of killing Sir Belduke. You were after this <span style="color:#E16935">letter</span>, weren't you?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
That's...merely wild conjecture. I didn't even know about that letter at the time!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You didn't? Now that's very strange.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
When Ms Mailer came by that night, Sir Belduke was busy writing that letter. And that's when you entered. Carrying a bottle of tomato juice.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
There's no way you wouldn't have known that you master was writing a letter to someone! And you could've known even more than that... For instance, perhaps you knew what <span style="color:#E16935">he was writing about</span>.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
That's enough! I served Master Belduke as his butler. I never would have pried into his private affairs! Whatever it was he wrote about in his final letter to the Storyteller...it is no concern of mine!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............ Your Honour.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, defence?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I'd like Ms Greyerl's last statement to be added to her testimony.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph. Any objections, Inquisitor Barnham?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............ No, Milord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. Witness, include what you just told us in your testimony!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
As you wish, Milord.

</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
That's right. I believe I have said as much already.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Then...how did you know? How did you know it was <span style="color:#E16935">addressed</span> to the <span style="color:#E16935">Storyteller</span>?

It's true this letter is addressed to the Storyteller. But <span style="color:#E16935">when</span> did you find out about it?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............ I have spoken about the murder with many people over the past three months. Everyone has been very kind to me. They have also told me all sorts of things. I must have heard about it... From someone, at some point.

And so you became a courier?

Yes. See, I only had one real skill... I'm light-footed! At first I didn't take it seriously. The job, I mean. I didn't care about work. But then I realised it. That it's not so bad to be useful. You know, to other people. So, I owe him a lot too, you see. Sir Belduke, I mean.

Yes! A courier must not disclose the contents of a letter, nor the names nor addresses of its sender and recipient! But I'll tell you confidentially that, uhm... I love gossiping.

Each of the witnesses in this trial has given their own account of what occurred. Therefore...whenever one witness has testified, the other remaining witnesses have listened.

<p>Phoenix:
</p>
<center>It was a single word that gave you away, Ms Greyerl.</center>
<p><br />
Greyerl:<br />
What...what do you mean by that?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The <span style="color:#E16935">name of the recipient</span>. There were only a few people who knew the intended recipient of that letter. Four people, to be precise.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Only...four people?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
First was Sir Belduke, the author of the letter. Then there was Ms Mailer, who delivered it. And of course the Storyteller, its recipient. As well as...one more person. The one who stole the letter, using a portal spell, and swapped it with the blank sheets of parchment...the <span style="color:#E16935">witch</span>.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
...!
</p><p>Mailer:
</p>
<center>Siiiiiiiirrr!!!</center>
<p>Maybe... Maybe I did. Maybe I spilled the beans. About the letter, I mean. Maybe I told the butler!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
You did what?!
</p><p>Mailer:<br />
Uhm. Well, because, you see...me and the butler are sort of friends. And it was about our dear Sir Belduke. I feel like I might've told her about it after all! See? If I did, that's how she knew! About the recipient, I mean.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Mailer:<br />
Huh...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Remember your testimony. You told us about the courier's duty to keep the details of letters confidential. And you have also testified... that you have never broken that obligation. Remember?

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
But...hold on just a minute. As the victim's butler, Jean Greyerl might have had a chance to catch a glimpse of the envelope.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
No. She didn't.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
When Ms Mailer came with the delivery, Sir Belduke was still writing that letter. In fact, he was <span style="color:#E16935">in the middle of it</span>. At that time, the letter had not been addressed yet. And the next morning, when the body was discovered, that letter was already in the letterbox. Keep in mind that Ms Greyerl would have had no opportunity to see it then, either.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Is that...so...? She went to report the crime without even setting foot in the study...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And then, Ms Mailer appeared and retrieved the letter. Needless to say, Ms Greyerl couldn't have learned of the letter's recipient afterwards.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Or maybe you have a good explanation, Ms Greyerl? I'd very much like to hear one. Can you please tell the court how you found out the <span style="color:#E16935">recipient's name</span>?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............ Mr Wright...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Uhm, yes?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Do you remember what I said when I was called to the witness stand?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
At the heart of alchemy lies the pursuit of the rules and logic that govern nature. You have demonstrated the power of your own logic.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ms Greyerl...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Are...are you saying...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Yes. I confess. The abhorrent witch who used the spell Godoor to swap the contents of that letter... and who took the life of Master Belduke... It was none other than I.
</p>
<hr />
<center>I was an only child, born to a poor family. I've been a witch since I was very little... When did I become aware of it? I don't remember. Although I was but a young child, I knew that being a witch was a crime. That's why I hid my witch's sceptre and wouldn't use magic at all. My father worked as a bricklayer. He toiled every day, but we could hardly make ends meet. One winter day...we couldn't afford to pay the rent. We were going to lose the house. My mother was in tears, and my father was sitting with his head down, wordless.<br />"I want money for Mummy and Daddy!"</center>
<p><br />
Greyerl:<br />
That day, I suddenly remembered about <i>[sic]</i> the <span style="color:#E16935">witch's sceptre</span> that I had hidden.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The Goldor spell...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I thought I'd try it, just once...casting the spell. But at the time, I had no idea what an irreversible mistake that would be.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Even though no one told me... I knew from the very beginning what magic I was able to use.
</p>
<center>What should I turn into gold? I was thinking about it really hard, the little girl that I was. Something that wouldn't stand out, that could be taken for a work of art. Then I decided. I chose a pretty leaf that had fallen into our garden.<br />"Goldor!"</center>
<p><br />
Greyerl:<br />
But...it wasn't the right thing to do after all. ...I was terribly <span style="color:#E16935">punished</span> for using magic, even just the once.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Punished?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...In what way were you punished?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I placed the leaf down in the back garden and cast the spell. But then... Margaret suddenly walked in front of me.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Margaret?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
My...closest childhood friend. Margaret... Right before my eyes, she... She was turned into gold!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, dear me!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I screamed and cried but...I knew I couldn't ask anyone for help. If anyone had seen it, they would have known it was the work of magic. And I knew...Margaret wasn't coming back.
</p><p>Espella:<br />
That...that's terrible...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Then, my mother and father's faces flashed before my eyes.
</p>
<center>We may have been very poor, but we were always happy together. Had I been captured as a witch, I feared my parents probably wouldn't be safe either. That thought tormented me more than anything. And so, I made the decision... I decided to end my own life. I threw myself into the river near the town. It was winter and the water was as cold as ice. I couldn't even move. It was painful. My consciousness started drifting away... ............ The next thing I knew...I was in Master Belduke's residence. He risked his own life jumping into the freezing river to save me. I burst into tears and told him everything. I didn't want to go back home. I would only end up causing my parents grief. Master Belduke listened to me without interrupting. And then, he told me this: "You can stay here. But from now on... you must live as a boy."</center>
<p><br />
Greyerl:<br />
Master Belduke met with my parents and explained everything to them. They were very sad...but they agreed it would be best if I didn't return home.
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Poor Miss Greyerl... That must have been so awful for her...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Master bought the house for my parents, so they wouldn't have to worry about paying rent any more. As for Margaret, turned into gold...he brought her to his residence. He knew that if anyone saw her, they would report an incident of witchcraft.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And this Miss <span style="color:#E16935">Margaret</span>, is she...still in that golden state?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Yes...she is.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Hmm, that's strange. We have received no reports of anyone by that name having gone missing.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Margaret is...being kept in the basement under Master's study.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The...basement? Correct me if I'm wrong, but this <span style="color:#E16935">Margaret</span>... Is she a...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Yes. My dear friend...was a <span style="color:#E16935">goat</span> that we were keeping at our house.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A...
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
...Goat.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Until then, Master Belduke had mainly been researching medicine... but since the incident with Margaret, he became known as an alchemist.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So that's when he became an alchemist... I was wondering why the goat was the only thing not covered in dust...)</span>
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
That's how I started a new life as Master Belduke's butler.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Sir Belduke would sometimes work as a physician, curing the townspeople of their illnesses. As his assistant, you have also shown commitment to helping the townspeople through your work.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I forgot about being a witch and was able to live happily, at peace with everyone... I thought it could stay like that forever... ............
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
...But those peaceful days came to an abrupt end. Tell us...what in the world was the cause?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............ Even I am not quite sure what led to this. However... it all started three months ago, with that <span style="color:#E16935">lightning strike</span>.
</p>
<center>Master Belduke and I were on our way back home, carrying specimens for experiments. An old bell tower appeared in the flames... Everyone who saw it was stupefied.</center>
<p><br />
Greyerl:<br />
But the expression on Master Belduke's face was <span style="color:#E16935">unlike anything I'd seen</span> before.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
His face went pale and twisted in <span style="color:#E16935">sheer terror</span>. He was shaking violently...
</p>
<center>It wasn't just astonishment at an unusual phenomenon. It seemed as if he was afraid of <span style="color:#E16935">something more concrete</span>.</center>
<p><br />
Barnham:<br />
Perhaps Sir Belduke saw something that others couldn't.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
He cancelled his experiments for that night and began writing a letter to someone.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A letter...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I found out about it when I brought him his bottle of tomato juice.
</p>
<center>He was writing feverishly, as if he were possessed. I... I saw some things. A few <span style="color:#E16935">words</span> in that letter... "...expose everything..." "...cannot keep this secret any longer..." "...the truth about the witch..." ......... Master Belduke... was going to confess... that I was a <span style="color:#E16935">witch</span>.</center>
<p><br />
Greyerl:<br />
Everything went black in front of my eyes. I will never forget the feeling... that overwhelmed me at that moment.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Is that when you decided to commit the crime?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
What I did first was "accidentally" singe a part of the wall in my room. It was an excuse to repaint that section of the wall...green.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Then you also painted the wall behind that painting in Sir Belduke's study.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
And when that fateful night came...
</p>
<center>I used a syringe to inject a soporific through the cork and into the bottle of tomato juice. So many thoughts were running through my head as I wished Master a good night. I opened the portal behind him... He was right there, in front of me, asleep. I reached for the letter in the letterbox, taking care not to wake him. And then I happened to notice the name on the envelope...</center>
<p><br />
Greyerl:
</p>
<center>"Storyteller".</center>
<p>When I read that name, the world all around me turned black once more. It's impossible to avoid what is written by the Storyteller... It seemed as if I could hear the doors to all escape routes shutting closed. It was the sound of despair.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I would like you to believe me... that the thought of taking Master Belduke's life never once occurred to me. I only planned to steal that letter and then disappear. But...
</p>
<center>As I looked upon Master, sleeping there in front of me... at that moment, I felt an evil presence awaken within me. Why did he save my life? And...why did he betray me? Before I realised what I was doing... my hands were clutching his neck. He...didn't move at all. So I...I...kept on clenching his neck. ............ That's it... That's the truth about what happened three months ago.</center>
<p><br />
Barnham:<br />
There is just one thing I fail to understand.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Yes?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
You said you wanted to run away once you had stolen the letter. Yet despite that, you continued to live in Sir Belduke's residence. And now, here you stand. Why did you not run away?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............ My life had been thrown into disarray due to the absurdity of magic. I had learned all about alchemy, living at Master's residence. Alchemy is concerned with the logic that governs the world. I...wanted to believe that there truly was such a thing. So I stayed in that place hoping to one day see the irrational nature of magic overcome by the power of reason.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Magic being overcome by reason...)</span>
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
That night... I swapped the letter with blank sheets of parchment and waited for the sun to rise. I resolved to wait for the day when my true identity could be exposed through reason and logic. Master's death remained a mystery for three months. And people started to lose interest. And then you appeared, Mr Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
On the day you visited the residence... I was listening to your conversation from the other room. "Has the time finally come for me?" My heart was racing with anticipation. Then... a few minutes after everyone entered that room, an unbelievable incident took place.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That incident...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
A witch appeared...in Master's study.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Wh-what?!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I wanted to get a look at the witch, so I created a portal in the wall behind the painting. Precisely at that moment...
</p>
<hr />
<center>"Goldor!"</center>
<hr />
<center>The witch used one of the very spells that I can use, too. When I heard those words, a single thought flashed through my mind. This was my chance. I could dispose of my witch's sceptre!</center>
<p><br />
Greyerl:<br />
I knew at the time what kind of a witch the Inquisition would be looking for.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
A witch that can use <span style="color:#E16935">Famalia</span> and <span style="color:#E16935">Goldor</span>.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
It occurred to me that I only needed to change one of the magic gems. I had previously found out that the <span style="color:#E16935">Famalia</span> gem was <span style="color:#E16935">purple</span>. I realised that if I swapped the <span style="color:#E16935">Godoor</span> magic gem for my <span style="color:#E16935">amethyst</span>... I could pin the blame for my crime on that other witch.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So you changed one of the gems and threw the witch's sceptre into that room, is that correct?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
...Exactly.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Wait a minute, Jean Greyerl! This statement of yours... is highly problematic!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
How so, Inquisitor Barnham?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Yes...you are right.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Can someone explain to me what this is about?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
I am a witch, indeed. A sinful creature that killed the person to whom she owed her life. However... regarding the gentleman standing next to you, Mr Wright... He may have fallen victim to a witch... But that witch was not me.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ah...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ohhh... Wait, whaaaaat?! Order! Order! Order in the court! What...in the... What is the meaning of this?!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Jean Greyerl admits killing Sir Belduke, but not to turning Sir Layton into gold. That is the gist of it, Milord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
B-but lying about it is meaningless!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Lying</span>?
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Just <span style="color:#E16935">being a witch</span> is a crime in <span style="color:#E16935">itself</span>. And the punishment for that crime is the same, regardless of whether she took one person's life or two. That's why there's no point in lying about it. I'm sure that's what the judge is thinking.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Greyerl is still claiming she never laid a finger on the professor... But if there's no point in lying...does that mean she must be telling us the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>?)</span>
</p><p>Luke:<br />
So in that case, who's responsible for what happened to the professor? If it wasn't her, then who was it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............
</p>
<center>............</center>
<p><br />
???:
</p>
<center>...Uhm.</center>
<p><br />
Emeer:<br />
Mind if I say somethin'?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............ Take a hint, witness. Does it feel like this is the right moment for you to talk?
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Yeah, well. That's kinda why I was stayin' quiet until now. But... I either say it now or never. ............
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Don't simply fall silent after saying that! It only makes it weigh on my mind more! Whatever did you want to say?
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
............ Oi, Bluey.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-yes?
</p><p>Emeer<br />
I need to make sure about somethin'. Me head's not what it used to be, y'know.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ugh... Yes...?
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
The alchemist's butler...uhm, lady butler. She slipped <span style="color:#E16935">sleep medicine</span> into his drink?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's correct. She laced his tomato juice with it.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
And then he...uhm, she strangled the alchemist afterwards?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes. Sir Belduke was unconscious from the sleep medicine, so he didn't resist.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
And that explains why we found no signs of a struggle at the crime scene.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Yeah... About that... I let it slip earlier about what I did at the crime scene, right? I told you that...uhm...I had a few sips of that <span style="color:#E16935">juice</span>.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
...And the sleep medicine mixed in made you <span style="color:#E16935">sleep like a log</span>. Yes, we remember.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Yeah, well... Here's the thing... This is just between us, okay? Y'see, when I appropriated that juice... the juice bottle was, well...still unopened.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It was unopened?
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Har har har. Me throat was parched, and I wasn't thinking straight. That brand new bottle was just there, waitin' for me, with a corkscrew conveniently laid next to it. I couldn't just let that go to waste. I swiftly pulled out the cork and got to drinkin'.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Wh-what...?
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
So, in case you don't get what I'm gettin' at, the alchemist... <span style="color:#E16935">didn't have a single drop</span> of the juice with the sleep medicine!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
W-witness! You... You... ...went to the trouble of opening a bottle found at a crime scene just to drink its suspicious contents?!
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
That's what I've been tellin' ya, I was dyin' of thirst!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That doesn't justify what you've done!

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The Inquisition shall deal with this witness after the trial. He will find out what it means to be dying of thirst in a more literal meaning. However, let us not waste any more time with him now. The witch has confessed to her crimes. There is no need to investigate Sir Belduke's death any further.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph. Indeed, you are right, Inquisitor. Her role in the Sir Layton incident is not entirely clear... but a person who kills her protector, to whom she owes her very life, can be nothing other than a witch. The court has sufficient grounds to sentence her as such.

At this point. your client's innocence has already been established. Therefore, whether there is a contradiction in that man's testimony or not should no longer be any of your concern.

The contradiction can be seen in one of the <span style="color:#E16935">sketches of the crime scene</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In one of the sketches?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Please take a look at Sir Belduke's <span style="color:#E16935">mouth</span>. We can see a line of <span style="color:#E16935">red</span> liquid <span style="color:#E16935">trickling down</span> from his mouth.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, well. We have already established that it was the tomato jui- Oh!

Exactly, Your Honour. Sir Belduke <span style="color:#E16935">didn't drink</span> any of the tomato juice that night...

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Which means, there's only one other possibility. That red line is, as we thought first of all, <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span>. Sir Belduke must have tried to fight back the assailant and bit his tongue in doing so.

Unfortunately, that would only bring us back to the <span style="color:#E16935">problem</span> we encountered earlier.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
"Earlier"...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
If the victim had put up a fight... then there should have been traces of a struggle at the crime scene. And yet, no such traces were found. That's what made you assume the witch must have used Famalia.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Ngh...! Y-yes, that is so...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
As I explained before... Master Belduke didn't struggle at all at the time. But when I think about it now, in light of the new information, it was very <span style="color:#E16935">unnatural</span>...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The victim didn't drink the soporific, yet <span style="color:#E16935">didn't struggle</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But...what in the... What does this mean? If it's not <span style="color:#E16935">tomato juice</span>, nor <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span> brought about through a struggle with the murderer... then what else could it be?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............ Since it's not tomato juice, we have to assume it's <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span>, after all.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Yeah, right? It's gotta be that!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
We have ruled out the possibility that the victim bit his tongue while struggling with the attacker.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Indeed.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Then there's got to be <span style="color:#E16935">a different reason</span> for that blood being there... He must have suffered <span style="color:#E16935">internal bleeding</span> that was somehow connected to his <span style="color:#E16935">death</span>... But what could have <span style="color:#E16935">caused</span> it?)</span> ...Your Honour. If I may ask one question...

The item he took from the crime scene is... probably something around here!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That's too vague.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Whaaaaaat? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Whoa, that was fast...)</span>
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
This witness...is covered in jewels, in a manner that defies good taste. Surely he could conceal countless magic gems about his person.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Wait, what?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But...Inquisitor Barnham, this witness is of a rather <span style="color:#E16935">masculine persuasion</span>!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
For all we know, he may be a <span style="color:#E16935">master of disguise</span>. We have been calling him "mister" all this while... But he may actually be a "<span style="color:#E16935">missus</span>"!
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
............ Uhm, Bluey?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes?

<p>Phoenix:<br />
It's this <span style="color:#E16935">bottle</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The bottle?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ms Greyerl, I'd like you to clarify something for me.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
What would that be, Mr Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Sir Belduke was working on creating certain medicines... He had various <span style="color:#E16935">dangerous substances</span> in his possession, as well. How were they stored?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Master kept them in a locked medicine cabinet. The bottles were labelled so that it was clear that they were dangerous. They have all been confiscated.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
As for those <span style="color:#E16935">labels</span>... Did they resemble... the label on that guy's bottle?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
...! Mister... What are you doing with a product of Master's research?
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
It's not what you think! I didn't have any evil intentions, or nothin'!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
That bottle belonged to Master. And it was used... to store <span style="color:#E16935">strong poison</span>. Poison strong enough to kill...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
P-poison...?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Wh-what?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The red liquid trickling down Sir Belduke's mouth was definitely blood. Now, as for what caused him to bleed like that from his mouth... it was the <span style="color:#E16935">deadly poison</span> from the bottle this guy stole from the crime scene!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
This is...outrageous!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat! Order! Order! Orderrrrr!
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! D'ya expect me to just keep quiet?! It was poison?! Poison! Am I...gonna die?!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />

</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Just wait and see. Time will tell.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Y-yeah, I guess.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
More importantly, I want to know why you have that bottle!
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Huh? Uhm. Well, that's... Uhh. Remember how I told you I drank the alchemist's tomato juice?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Indeed. It's not something easy to forget... Especially having heard it several times.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Well...that was when I saw it on the floor. This bottle right here. It was totally empty. And I thought, y'know, it's such a fancy-lookin' bottle and all. I'm a bit of a skull-fancier. They have this air of danger about them, right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
They certainly do.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
So, since it was there, and I was there too, I felt we were kinda meant for each other. I thought, "This bottle's so classy I could die for it!"
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Had any poison been left in the bottle, you would have died instantly. But if it was empty, it was probably harmless.
</p><p>Emeer:<br />
Ooooh! Hear that? I'm gonna live! Good thing I rinsed it well before use! *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp*
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But if the victim was killed by poison... that raises a new question, of course.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
<span style="color:#E16935">Who</span> could have poisoned him...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Considering all the evidence and the testimonies we've heard today, the answer is so close, I can taste it.)</span> Sir Belduke was poisoned by...

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Think about it, Inquisitor! That would explain the most <span style="color:#E16935">unnatural aspect</span> of his death.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The most <span style="color:#E16935">unnatural aspect</span>?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ms Greyerl, when you were strangling Sir Belduke... he put up <span style="color:#E16935">no fight</span> whatsoever, is that correct?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
Yes, it is. Until today, I was convinced it was due to the sleep medicine...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It wasn't. Because he didn't take any. The truth is, when you gripped his throat, Sir Belduke... was already dead. He had <span style="color:#E16935">poisoned himself</span>!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Nghhhh!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
B-but would the poison have caused him to bleed from his mouth?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
I personally know of no poison that works instantly and causes such symptoms.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Oh... Y-you don't? <span style="color:#0070C0">(I can't just tell them that it happens on TV all the time...)</span>
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
There are certain plants in this area that contain a highly poisonous substance. In the course of his research, Master Belduke found a way to extract that poison.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What am I hearing?! Is there really such a dangerous plant in Labyrinthia?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
The poison is very bitter to taste, so it would be impossible to secretly slip it into someone's food or drink... And it would cause internal damage. It is a very powerful poison... Drinking it would induce a most painful death.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
And to think Sir Belduke could...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But... did Sir Belduke really choose such an agonising death for himself? It doesn't seem like he suffered that much.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
...I would like to know that too.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ms Greyerl...
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
You mean to say Master killed himself after exposing me as a witch? I...I cannot believe it! He...he just wouldn't commit suicide!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Indeed, we cannot take such a theory at face value! Had he committed suicide, I dare say he would have left a suicide note!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............ I can't say why Sir Belduke committed suicide, but... I think there's a piece of evidence that can confirm his suicide was a <span style="color:#E16935">possibility</span>.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
There...is a piece of evidence like that?!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If you have such evidence, you ought to present it to the court immediately. Present the evidence indicating that Sir Belduke's death could have been suicide!

What we have here is nothing more than blank sheets of parchment. Whether or not there was a suicide note is something we can only speculate about.

That's right. But there is one person who knows whether this letter was really a suicide note.

You mean...the person who <span style="color:#E16935">swapped</span> its contents... In other words... You...Jean Greyerl.

Witness, you stole Sir Belduke's letter on the night of the crime. Tell us, what was written in it?

<hr />
<center>My dear friend... I hope you will be able to forgive me for leaving this world of my own will. I have finally made this decision, having seen that accursed bell tower appear in the flames on that dreadful night. That lightning was a sign that we have angered the gods. What I have done cannot be forgiven. I can never escape from it. For the past few days, I have been thinking that it might be best to simply expose everything. This town's secret... The truth about the witch... Of course, I understand that <span style="color:#E16935">secrets</span> need to be kept. However, I have grown very tired. I'm afraid I cannot keep the secret any longer. I have only two concerns. The first is my daughter. It pains me to be leaving her alone in this world... Although, she probably doesn't think of me as her father.</center>
<p><br />
Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A <span style="color:#E16935">daughter</span>...?)</span>
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Hmm? I was not aware that Sir Belduke had a daughter.
</p><p>Luke:<br />
Mr Belduke seemed to know a lot about this town... This town's "secret"... And the "truth" about the witch...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Truth about the witch... Somehow I don't think he was talking about Ms Greyerl.
</p><p>Greyerl:
</p>
<center>............ The second matter weighing heavily on my mind... is that Jean will be left on her own. Ah!</center>
<p><br />
</p>
<center>Seeing her growing up so strong and righteous, in defiance of her fate, had given me hope. A short while ago, she brought me my usual, and what will be my last, drink. There are so many things I wanted to tell her, but I could only manage a "thank you". She is a very sharp child. Had I said any more, she would have caught on. You could call me a selfish man... But I didn't wish my last memory of her to be a sad one.</center>
<p><br />
Greyerl:<br />
Master... Master Belduke...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............

<center>If the fate handed to her by this town has made her life an ordeal until now... I hope from the bottom of my heart that a wonderful story awaits her next. I intend to leave my residence to her. And I would like you to look out for her. Alas, it is time for me to put my pen down. My dear friend... what I truly wish to express to you is too complicated for words. I hope one day you will understand. But for now, I bid you farewell. The time has come for me to go.</center>

<p>It wasn't a denunciation of me being a witch...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Master Belduke cared about you... until the very end.

</p><p>Judge:<br />
What is it, Inquisitor Barnham?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
I think it is about time. ...For the <span style="color:#E16935">guilty verdict</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
G-guilty...?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The inquisition withdraws the charges against Maya Fey... and charges Jean Greyerl with being a witch.
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
............
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
All the evidence corroborates this accusation, and she even admits her guilt. Hence, the inquisition asks that the witch be found guilty and <span style="color:#E16935">punished</span> immediately.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Not so fast, Inquisitor Barnham!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
What do you want now, Sir Blue Knight?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Admittedly, Ms Greyerl did attempt to strangle Sir Belduke... but he had consumed a deadly poison and was already dead at the time! Therefore, she is not guilty of <span style="color:#E16935">murder</span>!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And one more thing! It also wasn't Ms Greyerl who turned Professor Layton into gold. There was another witch present at the crime scene. The defendant, Maya, saw her too! To put it simply... Ms Greyerl didn't kill anyone!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Yeah, she didn't kill anyone! And yet... you still want to burn her?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
M-Maya!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Do you even know how it feels to be put in this cage? It's like everyone's against you and it's super frightening! I'm not a witch... but I've been thrown into this cage and almost sentenced for something I didn't do! And now you're about to do the same to another person?! That's just not right!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
............ Is that all you have to say?
</p><p>Maya:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
The one who's in the wrong is not me, but you, Sir Blue Knight.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Whether the witch committed a crime or not is completely irrelevant. This is the Witches' Court. All witches must be punished by fire!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
But...that's crazy!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why...why, Barnham?!)</span>
</p><p>Espella:<br />
............
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Inquisitor Barnham is absolutely right. Being a witch is a crime. You understand that, don't you, Miss Greyerl?
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
...Yes.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Very well then. The court is ready to issue the final <span style="color:#E16935">verdict</span>. Maya Fey is found innocent! And in her place...
</p>
<center>Jean Greyerl is found guilty of being a witch and shall be cast into the fire!</center>
<p><br />

Nooooo, you caaaaaan't!

</p><p>Espella:<br />
Please, hold the verdict!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
E-Espella!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
What is it now, Espella Cantabella?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
There is nothing else we can do. This is the course of things, and you should know it well.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
Indeed. "All witches shall be cast into the flames." That is the law of this town... A law that was written by your very own father. And furthermore, a law that has always been obeyed in the town of Labyrinthia.
</p><p>Espella:<br />
A town like this...should never exist in the first place!
</p>
<center>What? Such insolence...<br />That's heresy! She's criticising the Storyteller's Story!<br />Even the Storyteller's daughter has no right to criticise the Story!</center>
<p><br />
Espella:<br />
Trials in which innocent people are sentenced to death by fire... I shall make sure this is the last one!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What do you mean, Espella?
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Since you're all so keen on the rules created by the Storyteller, you should know exactly what I mean. The stipulation for ending the witch trials: "Once the Great Witch Bezella is burned, the witch trials will end." At present... I am under suspicion. You know very well why that is, don't you?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You...you don't mean that you're...
</p><p>Espella:<br />
I am guilty. I am the Great Witch Bezella!
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Now, cast me into the flames! And let Miss Greyerl free!
</p><p>Greyerl:<br />
...! Miss Cantabella...
</p><p>Espella:<br />
This shall be the last of the witch trials! No one else need be burned hereafter!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Espella, just what are you saying?! I can't let you do that!
</p><p>Espella:<br />
Please, Mr Wright! Let me do as I wish. I'm sorry, but this is a problem concerning the people of Labyrinthia!
</p><p>Maya:<br />
No, please don't do it!
</p><p>Luke:<br />
There must be another way! You don't need to do this!
</p><p>Espella:<br />
It's all right. Luke, Maya... Mr Wright...and Mr Layton. I truly appreciate all you have done for me.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This can't be happening!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Miss Cantabella... Your confession will have very serious... or rather, <span style="color:#E16935">fatal</span> consequences for you. May we assume that you fully understand those consequences and are willing to accept them?
</p><p>Espella:
</p>
<center>............ I am Espella Cantabella, the Storyteller's daughter. But I also have another name... I am the Great Witch Bezella. I have lived hidden in the dark pages of my father's Story, deceiving all of you. Many lives have been sacrificed because of me.</center>
<p>But that shall end today.
</p><p>Judge:
</p>
<center>Court attendants! Seize that woman! She is the Great Witch Bezella!</center>

There is something very strange about that last statement!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I think not, defender.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Judge:<br />
If anything here is strange, I'd say it was you, defender.

Indeed, Milord. A baker turned defender, clad in such an outlandish outfit...is the very epitome of "strange"!

Do you mind if I ask you something, Ms Mailer?
</p><p>Mailer:<br />
Siiiiiiiirrr!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............
</p><p>Mailer:<br />
So? You wanted something? What was it? What did you want to ask about?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Thanks to that brain-piercing scream... I can't remember what it was now.
</p><p>Barnham:<br />
There are witnesses whom you should not bother without reason. Keep that in mind, Sir Blue Knight.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Please don't badger that witness unless you absolutely need to...or we will all go deaf.

Carry on with the cross-examination!
