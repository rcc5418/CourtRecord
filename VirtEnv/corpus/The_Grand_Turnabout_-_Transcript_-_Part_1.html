When we first met, you had an army of subordinates under your command... ...and you boasted of having the highest arrest rate in Interpol. And what now? Did you forget the fundamentals of investigation along with all of your men?

What... did you say...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Instead of questioning people at random, you should investigate the crime scene first. Am I wrong?

........Tch! I don't need you to tell me that. ...I'll do a thorough investigation.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well. At least it seems he's calmed for now...)</span>

Good grief... Could you please just try not to interfere with the investigation?

Huh? Do you know her?

Yes! This is sort of an outdoor film lot for Global Studios. They're shooting a movie here right now. I was the first to arrive today, to set everything up for the filming... ...but everything seemed strange... Those giant footprints... and that... d-dead body...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I see. We shall examine the body. At any rate, could you please contact the police?
</p><p>Penny:<br />
Y-Yes! Right away!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'll have to take the time to listen to her story later... First, let's examine the scene. There are many things <span style="color:#E16935">besides the body that concern me</span>. I'll need to examine every nook and cranny of this place...)</span>

The front entrance, which leads to the Tower Plaza, was locked with a combination lock. At the other hand... the lock on the rear entrance, which leads to the Grand Tower, was broken. Now, where does this lead us?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Heh heh heh! I know this one! The culprit entered from the rear entrance, right!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Exactly. And knowing this... we now understand one more critical fact. The culprit must be someone who didn't know the number to unlock the combination lock.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Right! If they knew the code, it would've been way easier to enter from the front entrance! Entering through the back door is common sense for a thief. It's much less conspicuous. We can't underestimate a culprit who thinks like a thief! Please keep your guard up!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She sure becomes lively all of a sudden when this subject gets brought up...)</span> To put it simply, everyone involved with the movie knows the combination for the lock. In other words, it's quite likely that the culprit is someone who is not involved with the film.

I still can't believe the president has been murdered... Do you think he was really trampled to death by a monster?

Surely you can't be serious? There are no such things as monsters.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Whaaat!? So it wasn't a monster who did this? Then, who do you say killed the president!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
As the president of Zheng Fa, I'm sure there are more than a few people targeting his life. Just like Shelly de Killer tried to do, not too long ago.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So, you think he was killed by someone like Mr. de Killer?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I can't say for certain yet... but neither can I deny that possibility.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But, we can't deny the possibility of him being killed by a monster, either! I mean, just take a look at all these monster's footprints! Plus, a horn-like object was lying on the ground next to the president.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

Did you already know about this "Moozilla" monster?

Yes... Indeed.

I guess that's to be expected, as the promotion for the film hasn't really started yet. "The Mighty Moozilla! Its revival breaks its 12 years of silence!"

This time, it won't just be Moozilla, a rival monster appears as well! Have you heard of it? Gourdy of Gourd Lake.

Ah, I see. You two aren't familiar with Moozilla. This is Moozilla's <span style="color:#E16935">original design</span> from 12 years ago!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Whaaat!? Th-Then, what's this?
</p><p>Penny:<br />
That's our take on it for the new movie. We revamped the design to appeal to modern audiences!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
"Revamped"...? But it looks totally different! And, no matter how you look at this one...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...it's a <span style="color:#E16935">cow</span>...
</p><p>Penny:<br />
Well, of course. After all, Moozilla was originally a cow monster.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
A c-cow monster...?
</p><p>Penny:<br />
Having a cow, an animal that humans are very familiar with, turn into a monster... ...allows us to question mankind's relationship with nature! That's the theme of Moozilla.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
......Meh. I just don't get it.

We made this replica of the original Moozilla's head for promotional purposes. We'll be using it to let people know that the film is a sequel to the original series.

I guess it would be hard for people to tell that they're the same monster.

Ms. Nichols. This head looks rather heavy... How do you transport it?

Ah, it's made so that it can be taken apart. It's not that hard, if you know how to do it. But, if you don't know how, it'd be pretty much impossible, I think.

Huh? Moozilla's head should have been on that stand...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But, the legs have broken off... It doesn't look like it can be used anymore.

Hmm. The broken legs seem to be badly burnt. I think it's safe to assume that a <span style="color:#E16935">small fire</span> occurred here.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
A small fire, huh? Is that what burnt and broke the legs of the stand?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
When the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
...it would've fallen off! So, the head <span style="color:#E16935">fell down because of the fire</span>!

Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Naturally, that means you don't even have a shred of investigate authority. So what would be the point of having a logic battle with someone like you?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmph...!)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Why would you say something like that!? Didn't you also just get reduced to being a lone agent!?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
.......... Hey. Answer me this. Even though you've lost your position as a "prosecutor"... ...why are you sticking your neck into this case?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
........ <span style="color:#0070C0">(Why do I still continue to investigate...?)</span> Agent Lang... Why are you pursuing the criminal who murdered the president? Because you're an Interpol agent?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
..........
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Right now, I am also chasing after a certain person. Someone in the shadows, who was behind the murder at the Grand Tower yesterday... Someone who placed Kay in grave danger. ...Even now, they are lurking somewhere, laughing at us. We will uncover the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>, and bring them to justice... ...and a title such as "<span style="color:#E16935">prosecutor</span>" has nothing to do with it. As long as the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> remains hidden... ...I will continue to seek out that <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>. For that is a part of my creed.
</p><p>Lang:<br />
........Haha! You... You're always trying to be so clever, but you really are kind of an idiot.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmph. Me, an idiot? How rude...)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
That's the answer I wanted to hear. ...Alright, I'll play along with you for a bit. I've lost all my men, and you've lost your title. And yet, we still continue to investigate... Let's begin this battle of logic between two kindred spirits!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You have my thanks...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
However, I won't go easy on you. I'll definitely catch the criminal who murdered Huang. And I won't let you get in my way!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes... I wouldn't have it any other way!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Let me show you the truth that this wolf has sunk his fangs into!
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Why Courtney? --</span></center>
<p>Lang:<br />
Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower.<br />
Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot.<br />
At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two.<br />
There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
It was just the two of them alone on the rooftop... No bodyguards?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah. I confirmed it with those bodyguards over there. They didn't know about it either. Guess he managed to give them the slip. He must've had something secret to talk about.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(President Huang and Judge Courtney... Did those two have some sort of connection?)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Apparently, he had an arrangement with the owner of the Grand Tower. He requested the entrance to the viewing platform be restricted so that they could be alone. Well, it's not like the owner could turn down a request from the president.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Does that mean... the last person to see the president was...
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Exactly... Courtney, you mean? It's gotta be her!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Agent Lang's reasoning is certainly sound... However, he has overlooked one major thing...! ...and that's where I must strike!)</span>

In here?

"10-20 minutes"... That's rather vague.

The problem here isn't when it happened. At least, not right now. What's important is what that woman did after that.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...What Judge Courtney did? Could you tell me about it in more detail?

Hmph. That's what I was going to do.

Are you certain she was alone in the elevator?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Yeah, I'm sure. It'd been 10-20 minutes after they went up to the roof... The security camera by the elevator only recorded that woman. She was definitely alone. I saw it with my own two eyes!

Aww. Poor Goddess of Law. We should give her an offering to lift her spirits!

As a matter of fact, there was one. A hidden route... that is.

A way down without using the elevator!? You'd better not tell me he flew off or something!

There's no need for that. It's quite simple. The president just needed to know... ...about the existence of the hidden 51st floor.

The 51st floor?

This building has a hidden 51st floor. It is accessible through a secret hatch on the rooftop. Using that route, it would be possible to leave the rooftop without using the elevator.

Hidden room? Secret hatch? How could the president have even known about that?

I wonder? I don't know the answer myself. I am merely raising a possibility.

In the first place, what's this all about? This hidden 51st floor. Sounds like something that ninja girl over there would love to get into!

No way! I'm sick of that place!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(For Kay, that place only holds bad memories, after all.)</span> The 51st floor was a secret storeroom for the <span style="color:#E16935">black market auction</span>. Its true purpose was only exposed yesterday.

I don't intend to give the culprit a single step of leeway. No one's seen the president since he met with Courtney two days ago.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That doesn't change the fact that the body wasn't here yesterday. If he were pushed off two days ago, it would be odd that he wasn't found until yesterday. I doubt a fall from the rood would take a whole day.

I'll admit, there are a few things I still haven't figured out.

</p><p>Lang:<br />

Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that?

Didn't you always have a small army of subordinates with you before?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
That's right... But, you know, being a lone wolf isn't all that bad. You don't have to worry about your subordinates or partners. All you need are your fangs. Simple, right?

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Certainly... it had come quite close to that at the time.)</span>

Shifu took responsibility for what happened... and our team was disbanded.

That's..... Well. I was a little worried about Shifu. ...It seems that even now, he's still chasing after them. The ghosts of 12 years past...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ghosts of 12 years past? Just what are you...
</p><p>MIB:<br />
.......... I'm sorry. I've already said too much. If you'll excuse me...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(These ghosts Agent Lang is chasing after... Do they also have something to do with this case?)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Looks like everyone's left now... So, what do we do now?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Well... Ms. Hart is going after the monsters, and Agent Lang is going after John. We should also try approaching this case from a different angle.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
What angle would that be?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...We should listen to what Judge Courtney has to say.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! That's right! If I'm not mistaken, Ms. Courtney is...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Courtney:<br />
...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Patricia Roland's trial.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
She said that she had a trial coming up!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. Let's head to the courthouse as well.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
'Kay!

<center><span style="color:green">April 6, 11:23 AM<br />District Court<br />Courtroom No. 3</span></center>
<p>Courtney:<br />
Court is now in session. Is the defense ready?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Of course, Your Honor! We can begin whenever you want.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
The prosecution has been ready from the start, Your Honor.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Jill Crane, the attorney in charge of the defense, has passed on from this world. Furthermore, Sebastian Debeste, the prosecutor-in-charge, has disappeared... And so, Franziska and Mr. Shields have taken over their duties.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Courtney:<br />
Before we begin, I would like to apologize for the delay of today's trial. As the crime took place in the prison, a place where justice is normally administered... ...and the defendant was the warden of the prison, further exacerbating the situation... ...additional time was specially arranged to investigate and prepare for the trial. In addition, the defense attorney in charge of the case, Jill Crane, has recently passed away... Due to these circumstances, the trial was further delayed. Mr. Shields, Ms. von Karma. At this time, I'd like to give you my gratitude for taking up this responsibility on short notice.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
I guess this is the last job Courtney-pie's friend left behind for us, huh? Well, Uncle Ray's more than happy to help out. Although having said that, I only had enough time to skim through the case files... Are you OK on your end, Franny-pie?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
What kind of prosecutor abandons his own case and vanishes without a trace...!? I won't allow any more delays in this trial while we wait for that foolish man to return. I have received the evidence just now. There should be no problem continuing the trial.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...You have my thanks. And with that, I hereby call the defendant, Patricia Roland, to the stand.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Roland:<br />
........
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Now then, will the prosecution please give us their opening statement?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Very well, Your Honor. The defendant...

</p><p>Roland:<br />
...Please wait, Your Honor.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
What is it?
</p><p>Roland:<br />
Well, there's something I'd like you to fill me in on. Just what exactly... am I doing in a place like this?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Then perhaps... you would do well to listen to the opening statement.
</p><p>Roland:<br />
Hmm. So if I listen to it, I'll get it, huh? OK then, let's hear it.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...That was the plan from the start. Now, if you would kindly shut up and listen. The incident occurred in the detention center and the prison Warden Roland is in charge of. The victim is Horace Knightley, who was being held in the detention center. The prosecution is certain that this woman here is the culprit. This knife, the murder weapon, is the decisive evi..... Huh!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Ms. von Karma. Is something wrong?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Th-That's... impossible! The evidence is...!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
What's wrong with the evidence, Franny-pie?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
The evidence... the knife's gone! The chisel with Dogen's bell attached to it is missing too!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Wh... Whaaat!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Order! Order! Prosecutor von Karma. What is the meaning of this?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I... I don't understand it either, Your Honor.
</p><p>Roland:<br />
If there's no evidence, then I suppose there's not much reason for me to be here. Some prosecutor. Can't even hold on to one little piece of evidence. What a dunce.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
I... I only received everything that the previous prosecutor had... Ah!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...It appears the culprit is that pampered prosecutor, the Boy Blunder. Hey, Courtney-pie.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
What is it?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Your Honor! Considering our predicament, what say we postpone the trial until later?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />

</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The defense's proposal is overruled.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Eh? Courtney-pie...?
</p><p>Roland:<br />
I know, right? It'd be troubling for me if this trial were to be delayed any further. I just want everyone to know that I'm innocent. As soon as possible.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />

</p><p>Roland:<br />
And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... "<span style="color:#E16935">In court, evidence is everything</span>." Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
.......... That is correct.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Eh!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
What!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Patricia Roland...
</p><p>Ray:<br />

</p><p>Ray:<br />
Hold your horses, Courtney-pie! You can't just declare her innocent all of a sudden!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Is something the matter? For the defense to object to a "not guilty" verdict...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Well, I mean... Even you must know that the warden over there is guilty, right? You were there with us when we found the murder weapon!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
........ Mr. Shields. A judge must remain impartial when handing down a verdict. That is why I cannot allow myself to get caught up in my own personal feelings... The person who was present when the murder weapon was discovered... ...and the judge sitting before you now, are two completely different people.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...You're kidding, right?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I can only hand down a verdict based upon the evidence that was presented.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />

</p><p>Franziska:<br />
There is evidence! It's just... Well, it's not here right now, but... A few minutes, that's all I need! I'll find the evidence and return to court, without fail! The prosecution requests a brief recess, Your Honor!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
........
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Th-The defense would also like a recess, Your Honor. Courtney-pie. Please...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
........ ...I understand. I shall grant your request.
</p><p>Roland:<br />
Well! Justine-darling! Aren't you wishy-washy today?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
This court will now adjourn for a 15 minute recess! During with, the prosecution and the defense shall prepare for the resumption of the trial.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
...Understood, Your Honor.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Phew. That was a close one.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Court is now adjourned!

</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The chisel...?
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Wasn't that just the fake murder weapon?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Dogen hid this chisel inside this dog's mouth. And the real murder weapon was hidden in very much the same way...
</p><p>Roland:<br />
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The real murder weapon is in the pond, inside the alligator!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
I wonder if it was stolen by someone...
</p><p>???:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ms. Berry and Mr. Keyes. Did you come to attend the trial?
</p><p>Regina:<br />
I came because I heard there's a really fun show around here! So, where is it?
</p><p>Simon:<br />
The trial for the case I got caught up in was supposed to have already started, but... ..our practice ran a little late. I believe it was somewhere around here, wasn't it?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Actually, two key pieces of evidence have gone missing: the chisel and the knife... The trial is in recess now. Sort of like an intermission. You just missed it, Simon.
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Wh-wh-wh-what's that supposed to mean!?
</p><p>Regina:<br />
Ah ha ha! Looks like Simon's going to get arrested again!
</p><p>Simon:<br />
Eeeeeeeeeek! Nowaynowaynoway, I can't...!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hmm. I guess Simon is his usual noisy self. ...Huh?
</p><p>???:<br />
To think that I would be humiliated like this!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...And here comes another noisy individual.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Now, now, Franny-pie. Let's just take a moment and calm down a bit. Maybe you could put that whip of yours away, him? Whaddaya say?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
That foolish prosecutor! When I get my hands on him... ...my whip is going to give him the thrashing of a lifetime!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Eek! Miles, why don't you try talking to her?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

Yes. That's right... I'm surprised that you know about Moozilla.

Y-Yes... I had heard about it from Sebastian. He told me that the movie was being filmed near the Grand Tower...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...She seems awfully shaken up about that. And I'm also curious about Sebastian, who went missing along with the evidence. She said she wouldn't talk about the president... However, I might be able to get her to reveal <span style="color:green">her secret</span> through another line of questioning. She is flustered beyond normal. There must be some reason behind it!

Earlier, when Moozilla was brought up, it seemed to be a sensitive topic for you... Is that "child" you spoke of involved with the Moozilla movie?

<p>Courtney:<br />
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! H-How!? How do you know that...!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You're usually so calm, yet you seem rather distraught right now. Please, tell me... Who is that child!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...I understand. If you've come to know this much... I shall prepare myself for the worst. The child I'm searching for... is a boy by the name of John Marsh.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
John...? Why do you want to know his whereabouts?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Well... That much, I simply cannot say...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Judge Courtney. Didn't you say you were prepared for the worst!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
.....!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Even if you don't intend to talk, I am determined to expose the truth. ...That is my resolve. <span style="color:green">Why is she searching for John</span>... I must get her to tell me the reason.

! As I thought... There was a kidnapping! Still, how is John's kidnapping related to you in any way?

......John and I are... ...mother and child...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? I was unable to learn much about the conversation she had with the president, but... ...I have learned of John's kidnapping. ...It was an unexpected result, but with that... it's checkmate.

</p><p>Kay:<br />
Whaaat!? J-John is... Ms. Courtney's son!? No way! I mean, he's already so big, for him to be your...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Yes... John is indeed my son. Please look at this...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is a clipping from a magazine...)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It's an article about John! Do you always carry this around with you?

<span style="color:#0070C0">(It seems the bond that they share is a strong one.)</span>
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
.......
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However, are you absolutely certain that he's been kidnapped?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Yes. I received a call from the kidnapper just before the trial started...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What were their demands?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
They had only one demand. A "<span style="color:#E16935">Not Guilty</span>" verdict for Patricia Roland...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I see. So that's what happened...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Roland:<br />
And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... "In court, evidence is everything." Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
.......... That is correct. The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Patricia Roland...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
So, that's why you were going to deliver a "<span style="color:#E16935">Not Guilty</span>" verdict earlier?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I am... not qualified to be a judge... A judge must be able to remain impartial and composed, above all else. And yet... despite this, in the trial just now, I... ...I was about to hand down a verdict that was led solely by my heart!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
.....Judge Courtney.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The Goddess of Law must be furious with me... ...but, I simply couldn't do it. I couldn't hand down a fair verdict... if it meant I had to sacrifice my own son!

Of course you can't!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Kay...)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
A real parent... would never abandon their own child! If that makes the Goddess of Law angry, then maybe the Goddess is the one who's wrong! The Goddess is guilty! Guilty! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. <span style="color:#0070C0">(To declare a goddess guilty...)</span> We're responsible for upholding the law, but at the same time, we are only human. Nobody would hand down a verdict that would sacrifice their own child.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />

</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Judge Courtney! So this is where you've been.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />

</p><p>Kay:<br />
.......... Ms. Courtney! ...My father, he was a prosecutor.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Your father...?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Yes. He stood in court, just like you. ...And now, with all that has happened, it got me thinking... What if, my father had been in the same position as you are now?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />

I know... if my life were on the line, my father... ...would definitely come to steal me back!

Steal you... back?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ms. Courtney. Why don't you let us take care of it?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
What...?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I'm gonna go steal John back for you! As the second Yatagarasu, I, Kay Faraday, give you my word!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
......
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Heh. So, the Great Thief Yatagarasu plans to steal the "<span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>", huh...)</span> What say you, Judge Courtney? Will you place your trust in our young Great Thief?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Prosecutor Edgeworth...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And, if it's alright with you, I wish to help as well.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
.....Thank you very much. I know that it's really not my place to ask this of you... ...but please... do whatever you can... Please save John.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
You got it! Just leave everything to us!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Allow me to leave my cellphone with you. You may get a call from the kidnapper at some point.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You have my word. I will ensure the safe return of your phone, alone with your son.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
And I will do everything in my power to prolong the trial. But... even then, at most the trial can only last for about two more hours...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Two hours, huh... So, until 2 PM. That's our time frame...)</span>
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...I must return to court. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall leave the rest to you.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh. Kay, I thought you were taking a break from being the Great Thief?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
As of right now, the Great Thief Yatagarasu is back in business! Alright! Time to put on the gloves and hit the pavement! It's my first request, after all!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Is that so? In that case, we'd better begin our investigation posthaste... ...if we hope to track down John...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Lang:<br />
Tch! Where'd he run off to!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
He might have just gone back home.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
...Or he may have run away.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
We should probably begin our investigation from the front of the Grand Tower.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
H-Hey! Hold it, Mr. Edgeworth! You're not the one in charge anymore! From here on out, this is a job for a Great Thief! Which means, I'm the leader now!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...If that's the case, then what am I supposed to do?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth, you get to be... the first ever Great Thief's Assistant!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So, I'm a thief's assistant now...?)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Alright! Let's get going! The Great Thief Yatagarasu takes flight once again!

<p>Kay:<br />
Here we are! The scene of the crime! Let's get to work! Now, say it with me, Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hm? Say what?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
"Even in the depths of night..."
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
..........
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Aww, come on! Say the rest with me!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And just why should I do that!?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Because! The Great Thief Yatagarasu has arrived on the scene! If we don't say the introduction, it just doesn't feel right!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I have no intention of becoming a thief.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Aargh! Fine, then. I'll do it by myself! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes, Kay. I know you are. I, on the other hand, am starting the investigation.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Tch. You're no fun.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...We don't have time for "fun". We only have until 2 o'clock. We need to begin making inquiries immediately.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Good thing we have a photo, so we can go right ahead and start asking around!

He sure is. Although he's young, he's a real pro. He never rests until he's satisfied. Then again... I can't say that I approve of him using the equipment without asking.

Dust Waste Management... Do they help you manage your wasteful spending?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No, this is where the garbage trucks bring all the combustible waste they've collected. ...By the way, Kay, why are you so fidgety?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It's nothing. More importantly, there's another waste center on the top right corner of the map!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Since they're separate facilities, they probably handle different kinds of waste. Although, there does seem to be a lot of waste management facilities around here.

What if the kidnappers stole the box?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! You mean they...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Exactly. They took it in order to carry John inside it.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
John's a tiny kid, after all. Then, the reason the taxi driver didn't see John was because...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It's likely he was put in the trunk as the kidnapper's luggage.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But, why did they need to go through all the trouble of hiding him?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
At first, the kidnappers must have intended to abduct him without being seen. However, they didn't anticipate all the policemen in the plaza.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah, I see. If they tried to just walk away with him, they would've been spotted...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Just the mere presence of policemen would have been a sizable threat.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I geddit! In that case, we've gotta ask the taxi driver!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Did the two men you told us about earlier have any luggage with them?
</p><p>Driver:<br />
Yeah. They stuffed a huge box into the trunk.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Then that's that! Those guys must be the kidnappers!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Do you remember where you took those men?
</p><p>Driver:<br />
Sounds to me like something serious has gone down here... If you'd like, I could take you to the same place I took them.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Let's do it, Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. Thank you for your help.

No problemo! Just leave it to me!

Mr. Edgeworth, are you alright? Your face is really pale.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I-I'm fine. The driver said they came to this house's <span style="color:#E16935">garage</span>...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
This must be where those two men brought the box! ...Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Look at the nameplate on the door!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Nameplate...? What!? "<span style="color:#E16935">Blaise Debeste</span>"!?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So this is... the chairman's house!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...She scolded me.)</span> Nobody's here... For now, it looks like we can get through this without being arrested.

! I see.. The pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place. Blaise... and the kidnappers did not intend to kidnap you. Their objective was John Marsh. They were planning to kidnap Judge Courtney's son... ...in order to have Patricia Roland declared not guilty!
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
J-Justine has a son...? And Warden Roland gets declared not guilty...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I suspect... the kidnappers mistook you for John Marsh.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
A-All of this... was just a mistake?&#160;! Wait... maybe that's why, back then...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hm...? Did you just remember something?
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
N-No..... It's nothing! I'm useless anyways... Just... leave me alone already!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Th-This is bad! He might be at his emotional limit...! I must get him to tell me <span style="color:green">what he remembered</span>, and try to calm him down as well. Based on how distressed Sebastian looks right now... ...it must have been quite traumatic. I'll need to help him get back on his feet!

I think I've also heard its name before. Monkey... Something Monkey... I've got it! "Madame Monkey"!

Almost, Kay. You were close. Its name is "Mrs. Monkey".

<p>Kay:<br />
There's something inside the safe!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Let's go ahead and have a look. There are some documents in here...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hmm... it's just a bunch of papers and... huh? There's a <span style="color:#E16935">photo</span> here too.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hm? This is a picture of...!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Huh!? Th-That's Mr. Knightley!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Knightley:<br />
...Horace Knightley. The president's bodyguard.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
Why is his picture here? And what are all of these papers for!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I don't know... We will have to read the documents to find out.
</p><p><span style="color:green">I'm all but certain there is a connection between Knightley and Dogen. Dogen's chess partner, whose identity remained unknown until now... ...was actually Knightley all along. That is proof enough. Tomorrow, I shall interrogate him in the warden's office. I'll get him to confess that he's one of Dogen's henchmen. That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago... ...you simply must retrieve it.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This... seems to be a report about Knightley.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Not to mention, it was apparently written before Knightley was killed...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Horace Knightley was murdered while he was being interrogated in the warden's office...)</span> Judging from the contents, this document was probably written by Patricia Roland.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I knew it!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The question, however, is who this report was addressed to.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! The owner of this safe is...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The Conductor... Blaise Debeste.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So, this proves that Ms. Roland and Blaise are connected!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. However, it's not just the two of them.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Blaise Debeste and Patricia Roland were searching for <span style="color:#E16935">Dogen's henchmen</span>.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Sirhan Dogen! That dog-loving assassin!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This means that there is a hidden connection between the three of them.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
I wonder what it could be?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I don't know, but it must be related to this case.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Report on Knightley jotted down in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! There's some other stuff in here that I remember seeing!

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hm? There's something on his finger.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Let's have a closer look! Oh! It looks like an expensive ring!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Don't steal it.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Wha...! I didn't do anything yet!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
It's Horace Knightley's... <span style="color:#E16935">The chessboard and the ring</span>... All of his possessions are inside this safe.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So basically, all of this stuff is evidence from the prison case?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Correct.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Then, the knife and chisel that vanished might be in here too! Let's see. Mr. Knife... Mr. Chisel... Hmm. They're not in there... I guess this is all just Mr. Knightley's stuff.

<p><i>Grand Tower - Rooftop</i>
</p><p>???:<br />
Young lady, good sir. ...Might I interest you in some cotton candy?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>???:<br />
There is also ice cream, if that is what you'd prefer?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Y-You! Sh-Shelly de Killer!
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
It's good to see you are well, Mr. Edgeworth.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Wh-What are you doing in a place like this!?
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
As you can see, I am selling cotton candy. Would you care for some "<span style="color:#E16935">Heavenly Cotton Candy</span>"? Even sweeter than death. One bite will send you straight to heaven.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's definitely not something I'd want to buy from De Killer.)</span>
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
The meaning of my message... Have you understood it?
</p>
<hr />
<p>de Killer:<br />
<span style="color:green">I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved?</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Have you been spying on us this whole time?
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
Spying? Heavens no. I was simply watching over you... ...while disguised as a cotton candy salesman.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Isn't that the exact same thing!? What is this man's objective?)</span> Were you the one... who murdered the president?
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
No. The contact with my client has already expired. ...President Huang is a bit of a celebrity in the world of assassins, you see. Over the years, many attempts on his life were made, and yet, he stubbornly lives on. He is a robust man, surrounded by flawless security. He even employs body doubles.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Robust... That president? Rotund seems more apt.)</span> ...However, it seems this time the president's security wasn't exactly flawless.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Rooke had only just prevented your previous assassination, but this time...!
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
I did not kill him. It is not my principle to kill needlessly. I am also grateful to Rooke, a worthy adversary who was connected to me by fate. Thanks to that man, I did not kill a target who had no value to be killed.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">("Thanks" to Rooke preventing the assassination... What does he mean?)</span>
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
My client deliberately gave me a false target. ...It was a betrayal most foul. I am now searching for my client. In all likelihood... ...it is the same person you are looking for.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is he saying that his client murdered the president?)</span> Just who is this person you are referring to...?
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
I, myself, am not allowed to say. It would be a violation of the rules. I cannot disclose the identity of my clients. For to do so would create a problem of trust with my other clients. This is precisely why I am personally searching for them myself.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
What are you going to do when you find your client?
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
Of course... they shall be rewarded with a punishment most befitting of a traitor.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Whaaaa!? That person... Wh-What'll happen to them?
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
...I will leave that up to your imagination.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It certainly won't be anything pleasant...)</span>
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
Oh, yes... I will tell you just one more thing. Three days ago, Sirhan Dogen escaped from prison.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What!?
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
Three nights past, Dogen's solitary cell was found vacant. It was almost as if he knew I would come pay a visit.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He visited Dogen's cell? Could it be, that the person De Killer is searching for is...)</span>
</p><p>de Killer:<br />
Well then, if you'll excuse me, I must get going. Let us both do our best in tracking down that person...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too!

Hey! What's that supposed to mean!?
</p><p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">But that's not all, y'see. Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What!? <span style="color:#0070C0">(This must be the person De Killer spoke of...!)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You have no reason to thank me!
</p><p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">Oh, you haven't noticed? My, that's troublesome, y'know. I wanted you to catch Blaise for me... ...so I took dear little Kay.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What?
</p><p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">If Kay was suspected, I knew you would investigate the case. And I was sure that the great Miles Edgeworth would be able to catch Blaise! It was according to my plan! And y'know, I get the feeling that you have the wrong idea, so let me clear something up. Blaise Debeste wasn't the one who kidnapped Ms. Courtney's son.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
! You... Why do you know about the kidnapping?
</p><p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">You and Ms. Courtney are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you...</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(How could this person know something like that...? Judge Courtney was supposed to have visited me using the detective's name...)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">I bet you're wondering how I knew about the kidnapping, right? It's quite simple, really! It's because darling little John is in my care right now.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What!?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Huh!?
</p><p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Quickly, little Kay! You have to hurry and steal him back! You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you?</span>

You even know it's my first job!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why does this person know everything in so much detail?)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">Well... I suppose I can't blame you for your mistake. It seems Blaise was after John as well, y'see.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So there were two kidnappings...)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">He's such a fool, y'know. Kidnapping his own son instead!</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Is John there with you? If he is, then I would like to hear his voice.
</p><p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">Hmm. He's here, but I'm afraid I can't do that. Y'see, he's asleep right now.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
In that case, there's no way for us to know if you really kidnapped John or not.
</p><p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">...Hmph. I suppose you don't have to believe me if you don't want to.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What is your objective? Is it to get Patricia Roland declared not guilty?
</p><p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">A not guilty verdict, eh... I couldn't care less about that.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So his objective is different from Blaise's?)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">...I think I'll keep my objective a secret for now. Well then, I must be going. I hope you enjoy yourself, Mr. Edgeworth.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Don't think you can get away with this.
</p><p>???:<br />
<span style="color:green">Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that.</span>

The only vehicles that came through the plaza this morning were the taxi and a blue truck.

And Mr. Debeste was kidnapped in that taxi.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. Meanwhile, John was attacked in the garbage pickup area... ...and the garbage was collected from there at 11 AM.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
...Aaah! I've got it, sir! The blue truck was actually...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's right. The blue truck that came through the plaza was a garbage truck. However, be that as it may, the officer who gave us this information... ...made no mention that the blue truck was a garbage truck.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Talk about careless! How could someone mistake a garbage truck for a normal truck!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's not it, Kay. Today was the day for the collection of bulk waste. I suspect it was a standard truck without a trash compactor that came by to collect the trash. ...John was taken away by this garbage truck. And where do garbage trucks go?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
To the dump, of course!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hold up! The culprit was disguised as a garbage collector, right? Then the truck was probably fake, too. How do we know they really went to the dump?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...No, the garbage truck should have been real.
</p><p>Kay:<br />

Ah! Only a real garbage collector could have unlocked it to collect the trash!

Precisely. We should assume that a genunine garbage truck was used. For example, the kidnapper could have put John into a large cardboard box. If the box was mixed in with the rest of the bulk waste...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
...the garbage collector would have carried John away without even knowing it!

Gummy! Why are you running away!?

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Detective Gumshoe...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
When Mr. Edgeworth gave up his prosecutor's badge... ...I just didn't know what to do.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Detective Gumshoe! Don't follow me!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gumshoe:<br />
......And then, I began to think. If Mr. Edgeworth isn't a prosecutor anymore... ...does that mean I'm no longer a detective?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
...But that's not true. Even without Mr. Edgeworth, I'm still a detective! And investigating is my job! Detectives don't investigate just for the sake of prosecutors, pal. That's why... even if I'm on my own, I won't stop investigating!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So, you've been investigating by yourself?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Then perhaps, at that time...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Franziska:<br />
.....You should thank your "former" subordinate. He gave me some valuable information which may save Kay Faraday.

</p>

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
So, Jill Crane's autopsy report...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
I went to the detention center to see how Kay was doing. That's when I heard...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Blaise:<br />
When you get to where I am, you can just create your own truths. Anytime you want. Kay Faraday is the culprit. That was a truth that I simply manufactured out of thin air.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ngh...!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
...Good, very good. That face. That expression!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
You heard that conversation?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
That's right. And that's why I looked over the evidence again myself, sir.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Gummy, that's amazing! So it was you who saved me!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Kay... I'm really glad you got your memories back!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Thank you...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Do you get it now? I can investigate on my own.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Gummy! Don't run away! You've already proven that you can investigate on your own. After all, you saved me!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
........
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Detective. I need your help. Currently, I'm not a prosecutor, nor am I much of anything else. Even so, I will pursue this case. I ask you not as a prosecutor, but as a friend... Detective Gumshoe... Will you help us?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
...Ooh. P-Please, cut it out, sir. ..........
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Gummy!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />

Detective Gumshoe. Please tell me what you've found in your investigation so far.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Roger! Leave it to me, sir! I have three things to report! First up, is about Kay's clothes that were sent to the crime lab! Traces of an extremely powerful sleeping drug called <span style="color:#E16935">Sleepy zZz</span> were found on them!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So that means, after Kay was drugged at Gourd Lake... ...she was brought to the rood of the Grand Tower.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
That's right, sir! Now, for item number two... The footage from the security camera at the Grand Tower's elevator.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The footage that captured President Huang and Judge Courtney going up to the roof.)</span> The elevator is generally the only way to get to the rooftop. And if the elevator was used, the person who used it would be caught on camera...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Exactly! In other words, if you look over the footage from a couple of days ago... ...you should be able to see an unconscious Kay being carried up to the roof!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Then, Gummy! Does that mean you...!?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
I checked out all the footage from before the incident two days ago on fast-forward!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I see. And the results?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Well, actually... nothing came up, sir. Kay never showed up on the tape at all...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That was unexpected... I guess it won't be so easy. How was Kay brought up to the roof of the tower? I should take a moment to carefully consider the possibilities.)</span> Well then, let's hear your third and final report.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Yessir! Last but not least, the most important thing to report... I'm so happy to be able to investigate with you again, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm gonna give it my all to arrest the culprit! ...That is all, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmph. I apologize for putting you through so much, Detective Gumshoe. However...)</span> ...That was your most important report? It had nothing to do with the case at all. I would have preferred something that's actually useful.

Ugh... That merciless attitude, that's the Mr. Edgeworth I know, sir!

This document contains a detailed report regarding the interrogation of a certain man.

A certain man?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That man being the late Horace Knightley. And, the one who interrogated him was the defendant in this trial, Patricia Roland.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
! So that means, that was the interrogation where...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's right... Patricia Roland murdered Knightley in the aftermath of the interrogation. And that very interrogation has been recorded in this written report!

</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Miles Edgeworth. Just now, you referred to that document as a "written report". Now, just who in the world was that report written for?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I thought you might ask that, Franziska. And that's precisely what is most important about this report...! We found this document inside the safe in the storeroom on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
The 51st floor... The storeroom for the black market auction!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed. And the Conductor of the auction was you, Blaise Debeste!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
............
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You received a report about the victim from Warden Roland! In the face of this evidence, can you still say you have no connection to this case?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
......In regards to that, I refuse to answer.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
It has yet to be proven in court that I was the Conductor of the black market auction.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Oh? Have you already forgotten the events of this morning? I believe I had already proved it back then, did I not?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
I will not deny that I was bested by you. However, that was at the crime scene. Who knows if the results will be the same in court. An acquittal is still possible, y'see. ...Until it's been proven in court that I am the Conductor of the black market auctions... ...you can't prove that document was addressed to me.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Your logic is twisted...!
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
That's not very nice, y'know. My logic isn't twisted, is it? Courtney? Don't you feel the same way? It was quite unlike you to allow Former Prosecutor Edgeworth's statement just now, y'know. ...It saddens me, y'see. That you would fail to uphold the <span style="color:#E16935">law</span> as a judge should. In fact, I'm so upset by this, I may have no other choice but to use my last resort, y'know.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
.....I-It is as you say. Something that has not been proven in court does not merit any deliberation. I will have to... overrule... Mr. Edgeworth's claim.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ngh... As I thought, until John has been rescued...)</span>
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Y'see? The <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> at the scene and the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> in the courtroom are two very different things.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So, you're saying the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> can be distorted in court, as long as it's for your sake?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
What a horrible thing to say. I'm not distorting the truth or anything like that, y'know. If a not guilty verdict is handed down, then that becomes the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>. That's all it is, y'see.

Naturally, the defense has no objections, Your Honor. I'm sure the defense attorney originally in charge would say the same.
</p><p>Franziska:<br />

Now then, allow me to ask once more... Is the prosecution ready? Prosecutor Debeste. What is this new evidence you wish to present...?
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
.....The missing knife and chisel, Your Honor.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
You mean they've finally been found!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Prosecutor Debeste! Is this true!?
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
...Th-The knife and chisel... I wasn't able to find them... I searched and searched! I really did! But... it was already too late...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Too late...?)</span>
</p><p>Ray:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
I remembered... This morning, when I passed by Pops in the garage at home... ...he was holding something wrapped in a newspaper.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Debeste:<br />
Pops, where are you going?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Ah, Sebastian. Just taking out some trash.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Debeste:<br />
At that moment, I heard it. .....The faint <span style="color:#E16935">sound of a bell</span>.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Could that sound have been, by any chance...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...the bell attached to Dogen's chisel!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
In other words... you're saying that the witness threw away the evidence?
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
........
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
I searched for it, but I didn't make it in time. I'm sorry...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Where exactly did you search for it?
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
The <span style="color:#E16935">garbage dump</span>! I went to the garbage dump and searched everywhere! I thought the evidence Pops threw away had to be there...!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hm? Isn't that...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Sebastian?)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ah! What're you doing here?

WHOOOOOOOAAAHH!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
H-He ignored us...

<p>Edgeworth:<br />

This is...? It smells rather peculiar...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Now that you mention it, there's kind of a funky smell coming from you as well...
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Wh-What do you expect!? I was digging through garbage!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And what of the knife?
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
I think it's buried somewhere in that giant mountain of trash... ...but I couldn't find it by myself.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...I understand. I shall accept this into evidence.
</p><p>Blaise:<br />
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well done, Sebastian! You never betray my expectations, y'know! You searched so desperately through the garbage and that's all you have to show for it?

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What?
</p><p>Franziska:<br />
Huh!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Wh-Who are you?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Lang:<br />
Judge Courtney. It's still too early for a happy ending. Lang Zi says: "The end of the trial is not always the end of the case."
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
And who... might you be?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
The name's Shi-Long Lang. I'm just a humble, lone investigator.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Do you have some objection with this trial?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Hah! Not a chance! The defendant there has a heart as black as a moonless night.
</p><p>Roland:<br />
Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Agent Lang. What are you talking about?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
The <span style="color:#E16935">SS-5 Incident</span> from 12 years ago... It's a case I'll never forget.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(12 years ago...?)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Lang:<br />
......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Might it have something to do with Lang's father and President Huang?)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Patricia Roland. And you, Blaise Debeste. Back then, the two of you killed off the Lang clan...
</p><p>Roland:<br />
Rrgh...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Were you involved in the incident 12 years ago?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
That's right, I was. However... I'm not here to chase after ghosts of the past. I'm here for you, Justine Courtney...!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
M... Me?
</p><p>Lang:<br />
You, and one other...
</p><p>John:<br />
..........
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
John!
</p><p>Lang:<br />
Ms. Courtney! You're coming along too! As a suspect in the murder of the president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang!

</p><p>Lang:<br />
Settle down, Mr. Prosecutor. The investigation has only just begun. We're going to inspect the crime scene with the suspects in attendance.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Agent Lang... did he get his hands on some new pieces of evidence?)</span>
</p><p>Lang:<br />
If you have any objections, then you can tag along as well.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...I shall do just that.
</p><p>John:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
