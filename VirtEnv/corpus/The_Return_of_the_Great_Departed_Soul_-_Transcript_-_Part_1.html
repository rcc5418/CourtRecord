The Return of the Great Departed Soul</div>
<p><br />
<i>Anime cutscene</i><br />
The grand, end-of-the-century Great Exhibition of London - surely, there is not a soul who has failed to hear of it. Wondrous new works of culture and industry from every corner of the globe had converged on Hyde Park. Welcoming over fifty million visitors, the last great hurrah of this century astonished and delighted people of all nations, and ended on a note of resounding success. But, as regards to the terrible catastrophe that occurred during the festivities, very few are aware my friend, Mr Herlock Sholmes, had a hand in unravelling the matter. For, from the shadows, it was he who earnestly unearthed the facts of the case. And like the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, which rose high into the skies of Hyde Park, Sholmes's brilliant deductions - as clear and lofty as the Crystal Tower itself - brought the truth to light.
</p>

<p><i>Rendered dialogue</i>
</p>
<center>We're here at the showground of the Great Exhibition, which is absolutely packed with people... The weather is unusually fine, and we're about to witness a most extraordinary scientific experiment!
<p><br />
</p>
Ladies and gentlemen, the twentieth century will see steam engines and electrical power dominate the world! Horse-drawn carts will give way to the motor car! Ships will sprout wings and take to the skies! And today, we showcase even more advanced technology! A glimpse into the future! A world first! A demonstration of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! A man will literally be disassembled by a pulse of high-voltage electricity, and beamed to another location... ...whereupon his body will be reassembled by a series of complex calculations exactly as it was before! In but a few moments from now... ...this gentleman will, in the blink of an eye, complete an incredible journey through the air... ...to arrive an instant later, on the Crystal Tower behind you!</center>

The thing about those scales is, they're only ever in balance right at the start of a trial, aren't they? Otherwise they always seem to be hanging one way or another...

Oh! Sorry, um...what was that, Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hmph. What's the matter with you? You've been miles away all morning. Didn't you like what I cooked for breakfast?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No no, that's not it at all. Um...what were we talking about again?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Today's paper! It's full of news about the Great Exhibition again!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah yes...the Great Exhibition... I'd like to go sometime. .........
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You're really not your usual self today. You seem very down. Don't you agree, Hurley?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm...? Did you say something? Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh gosh! You're even more down!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Wh-When did you arrive, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I've...been here for about half an hour already. We had breakfast together.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
What?! Why didn't you mention it before?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, um...thought you might have known I was here. You know, because...breakfast?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm, Iris is quite right. You're clearly lacking in vim. So much so that I didn't notice your presence.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Thanks.)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Of course, I could deduce the reason perfectly well with some simple observations.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Let's see... Yes, for example, your tussled hair this morning, with all its unruly spikes. Clearly it can be deduced therefore, that-
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, let me stop you there, Mr Sholmes, because I think I can see where this is going. My hair always looks like this. It always has. Ever since we first met, in fact.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Oh really? How interesting. It just doesn't look like a haircut as such, I suppose. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Thanks again.)</span> ......... It crossed my mind recently...that it's been six months now.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Six months?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Since I was forbidden from working in court. So I've been wondering how much longer I'm going to be banned.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh... Well, that would explain why you seem rather glum. Don't you agree, Hurley?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm...? Did you say something? Iris?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ah...back to moping...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's the matter with Mr Sholmes today? He seems even more down in the dumps than me.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I know! And the Great Exhibition has opened! You'd think he'd be excited. Oh, why don't we all go to see it together?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I want to! Of course I do! But I can't! ...Not for the time being.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Why not?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Why not? Why not?! Because! I'm a great detective, after all!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So you're embroiled in some tricky case that you can't be distracted from? Is that it?)</span>

I don't remember hearing that you're working on a case, Hurley.

The Great Analytiscope! It can analyse absolutely anything, you know!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It does seem incredible. ...And at the same time, incredibly useless.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ah, but it looks impressive, doesn't it? So that makes it very useful.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How does that make it useful?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Because! It means you can pawn it for lots of money! The pawnbrokers always make idle remarks like 'What an incredible-looking machine...'

Everything's in intricate balance. Hurley spends ages on it. If you were to touch even one thing, the whole lot would come tumbling down.

You know, Hurley decided he was going to clean it out himself last year. But you can guess what happened, can't you? He got himself stuck inside the flue.

When you call it a 'concoction' it sounds more like a science experiment than something for teatime.

Oh, really? And this garnet was blue, was it?

That reminds me of a dream I had the other day. It was such a funny one! It woke me, actually. I was typing for a whole hour in the pitch-black, but I didn't make a single mistake!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's incredible!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But then, when it got light...I found that there wasn't any paper in the machine. Now I wonder if I'd actually been typing at all...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I think you might just have fallen asleep on the job.

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Half a year ago now... ...I took on the defence of a young girl in a trial heard at the Old Bailey. What at first seemed like a simple case of murder that took place at a London pawnbrokery... ...turned out to be one part of a much more far-reaching plot that involved the British government. During the course of the trial... ...it was found that I made an unavoidable, yet at the same time, unforgivable mistake.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Words fail me. This situation is...utterly deplorable. Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I will decide upon your fate following the conclusion of this trial.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Of course, My Lord.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In the end, I had my right to represent people in court revoked. I was told I had to spend my time in research and study, so that's what I've been doing.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You have, haven't you, Runo? Reading all those big, fat tomes about British law up in your room. And the notes about Sholmes's old cases.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Brewing Iris's special blends of tea... Fetching my daily bread for me... You've become something of a manservant around here. Start on the silverware next, Master Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...I'm thinking of going to ask the powers that be to reconsider. Specifically Lord Stronghart, at the British Supreme Court on Whitehall.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Lord Stronghart?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, the delightful Lord Chief Justice? ...Not my favourite fellow.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He's not mine, either. But he's the man I have to talk to. He's the only one who can grant permission for me to start working in the courts again. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I came to Britain to become the best lawyer I could. And I can't do that just sitting around here!)</span>

It says in the paper that Lord van Zieks was attacked! That's terrible!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
You know the legend of the Reaper of the Bailey of course, don't you? Only too well, in fact.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Prosecutor Barok van Zieks...)</span> They say that if the Reaper is the prosecutor in a case, there's no salvation for whoever's in the dock... ...even if the defendant is found not guilty. Once the Reaper has someone in his sights...one way or another, that person's time left on this earth will be short.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
London's finest rogues always find ways around the law. They'll stop at nothing to secure an acquittal at trial. Falsifying evidence, paying sham witnesses, threatening jurors, bribing judges. But even such devious tactics as these cannot save them from the hand of the Reaper. As you've experienced yourself, haven't you, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes. I've seen the Reaper's 'retribution' at work.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Many of these criminal rogues are reckless and quite unafraid to die. If a leader among their fraternity is seen to have been 'taken' by the Reaper, retaliation like this does occur. Really, the capital has a never-ending supply of such scoundrels.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So... Do you mean... ...Lord van Zieks has been attacked like this before? This isn't the first time?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
He's quite an accomplished combatant, you know. He doesn't take these attacks lying down. Although...it seems that his assailants were armed with guns this time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh my goodness! Is, is he alright, then? Is Lord van Zieks hurt?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
My dear fellow...how on earth would I know?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, in the article here it says: 'As to what of Lord van Zieks and his condition? All will be revealed in tomorrow's morning edition!'
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, I see. Well, we shall have to be patient then.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No no no! I can't wait until tomorrow!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
In that case, you shall have to enquire with somebody in the know.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...who? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Lord Stronghart...perhaps?)</span>

Look at the prawns and the anemones gently swaying around in the tank. Regular cleaning, some food and fresh seawater is all they need. And some conversation, of course. It seemed like a lot of effort at first, but it was worth it. I'm starting to be able to tell what they're thinking. Funny to think that so many people in London had aquariums like this once. When they were in vogue. You'd never expect to find sea anemones in the middle of the capital! I think I'll have to name them soon...

It's been about six months now since I was last here. But some things never change. Like the sense of foreboding I always seem to feel in this place. <span style="color:#0070C0">(It doesn't seem to be bothering Iris at all, though. She's happily reading over there...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />

Ah. I understand you wish to speak with me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! L-Lord Stronghart! I trust you've been k-keeping well?

You need only savour the air for a moment in this grand office to understand his pre-eminent status.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
As you will be aware, the Great Exhibition of London is now underway at last. We're extremely busy as a result. Policing the grounds, guarding the new technologies, dealing with petty crime... And furthermore, as of next month, we shall open the International Forensic Science Symposium.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...I've not heard about that.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Investigating authorities from forty countries around the globe will be taking part. Including from your own land. Forensic science is the future! The world must embrace it! As we're the hosting nation, I have much to do. And it is my highest priority. If others must wait for my attention as a result, so be it.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

A large explosion...?

It does seem as though criminal investigation needs to embrace scientific methods, doesn't it?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Exactly!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Agh!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
London - the global epicentre of culture, science and wealth - now has a population exceeding six million. Sadly, crime in the capital is growing at a similarly startling rate. So it's imperative that we use the latest scientific methods to investigate and resolve cases as efficiently as possible.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which is what's known as 'forensic science', isn't it?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Exactly! The future of policing!

Regrettably however... ...Britain is currently dragging its feet when it comes to the adoption of forensic methods.

Fortunately, Lord van Zieks emerged from the attack unscathed. Street ruffians are no match for that man. He's a very capable fighter.

But, but that's incredible! They were armed with guns! Why was he attacked, though? Do we know?

But, but you're not suggesting that was the work of the Reaper, surely?

All the criminals who manage to get off in court then meet with mysterious ends outside the courtroom. And fearful of that fate, they seek to strike at Lord van Zieks first. I know there's no evidence that he actually is the Reaper in that sense, but still... Something's clearly going on here!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I have van Zieks work for the prosecution service for two reasons: Firstly, the man is the best prosecutor in the capital, bar none. And secondly... ...any deaths of criminals that have occurred outside the courtroom following his trials...are nothing to do with him.

But that doesn't make sense! How can you explain the way so many have died if not by someone's hand?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Van Zieks may have earnt himself the moniker of the Reaper, but he is no killer. So he will continue to prosecute on behalf of the Crown. ...Unless he wishes otherwise, of course.

That's my apprentice. And he's sitting there of his own free will.

Are you referring to the attack on the Reaper that was reported in the papers?

The Reaper? I'd be interested to know the Reaper's true identity myself. Assuming, that is, such a fabled fiend genuinely inhabits our great courtrooms...

Lord Stronghart said that the assault last night was some sort of revenge attack?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
True. Carried out by henchmen of Odie Asman's criminal organisation. The investigation meant their arrests were imminent. Presumably some hoped to kill me before that happened.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Odie Asman...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
He's always masqueraded as one of London's most powerful financiers. A global investor. But his enormous wealth came to him by underhand means, via his criminal activities.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
And he used that money to buy himself a verdict of not guilty when he found himself in court, didn't he? Being prosecuted by you, Mr Reaper.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
But the man got his comeuppance in the end. Yesterday in fact, in extraordinary circumstances. It was <span style="color:#E16935">a most unusual cause of death</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I know about that! It was super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis gone wrong!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Asman died when the demonstration on the public experimentation stage ended in an enormous explosion.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Correct. And you think I have some kind of divine ability to cause an accident like that to happen, do you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...no, that does seem a little far-fetched. <span style="color:#0070C0">(If this man really is the fabled Reaper, then he has to be innocent of this particular death, at least.)</span>

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?! You're going to be defending him?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, yes, that's right. Though I barely know the man's name yet, to be honest.

Albert. Albert Harebrayne.

Lord Stronghart said the same. He believes you're not involved in any way.

Ah, yes... It seems there was a reporter nearby when that little skirmish took place. I had no idea I'd been photographed. It was careless of me.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It looks as though it was taken after the people who attacked you had run away, though.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Rest assured, the police have already apprehended every last one of them.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But there's someone else fighting alongside you, it seems. And I think it's <span style="color:#E16935">the same man</span> who's sitting over there as we speak, isn't it?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... As I mentioned already... ...he's my apprentice.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Perhaps you could tell us a little more about him?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Ah yes, there's something I've been meaning to ask you...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! What's that?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
That Nipponese man. Is he faring well?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The one arrested twice in succession six months ago. With the stoop. And the moustache. And the jitters.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! Mr Natsume, you mean?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
...I'm not sure he'd be very pleased to find out you identified him from that list, Runo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He's fine, thank you. In fact, I received a letter from him by international post only the other day.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I see. ......... Well, I think we can end our discussion there, don't you? There's little time left before tomorrow's trial. I advise you to spend it investigating the case.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, thank you for the advice. And for the conversation. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I can't believe he's asking after Soseki-san. After a 'Nipponese'! I'm not sure whether to feel happy about that or worried.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
I never imagined that Mr Reaper would be friends with a mad scientist, did you? That's a turn-up for the books!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A mad scientist? Ah, you mean Professor Harebrayne? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, it might be worth quizzing the professor about his relationship with Lord van Zieks, I think.)</span>

The warden said cell eleven. That's this one...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh! There's someone curled up in a ball in the back corner, look!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's his name again? Professor Albert Harebrayne, wasn't it? ...Um, excuse me! Professor Harebrayne!
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
...! Who are you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a defence lawyer.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
A LAWYER!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Was it something I said?!)</span>
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
A, a lawyer, you say? W-W-W-Would you be here... a-a-a-about the experiment? ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND MY HYPOTHESIS?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Your...hypothesis? Sorry, I don't-
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Yesterday's demonstration! That demonstration was... That magnificent demonstration was... It was an out-and-out success! By anyone's calculations! B-B-B-But despite that... ...no one listens! No lawyer believes in the science! When it's explained, they all leave...at high velocity! Haah...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, you mentioned the demonstration yesterday...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
The papers have called it a spectacular failure. After all, a man died in the explosion, didn't he?
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Yes, you could interpret the results that way if you really wanted to! Well, I, I suppose in the strictest sense... ...the experiment was a failure. But at the same time, it was a great success!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...You've lost me.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
I saw it with my own eyes! Right there in front of me! Mr Asman was spontaneously disassembled! Until then, everything was going exactly as my calculations had predicted! At that point, he should have been beamed to the Crystal Tower by <span style="color:#E16935">instantaneous kinesis</span>! However...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...The machine exploded and Mr Asman in fact perished?
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Yes. I can't deny that part of the experiment was a failure.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So what you're really saying is, the large explosion that killed Mr Asman was <span style="color:#E16935">an accident</span>, correct?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But the bigwigs had you arrested on <span style="color:#E16935">suspicion of murder</span>.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
......... I was responsible for a man's death. That is the immutable truth here. And for that, I wish to be punished. At once! B-But... ...murder?! Never in a million years! It, it was an accident! Simply an accident!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I see.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hurley and I were talking this morning, you know. He said the situation would change completely depending on whether it was treated as an accident or murder.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How exactly?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, if it really was an accident, then the professor's machine would be kept in <span style="color:#E16935">protective custody</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
On what grounds?
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Ah, yes, it's newly established here in Britain. <span style="color:#E16935">The Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That one passed me by...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But if the case is treated as murder...
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
...Then they'll say my machine was <span style="color:#E16935">the murder weapon</span>, and they'll be able to pore over it as much as they like! If they examine it in detail, they'll find out how it's made, and then... They'll be able to copy my idea! My precious <span style="color:#E16935">hypothesis</span> will be stolen! The machine must be protected from that at all costs! That's why it's imperative this whole incident is shown to have been <span style="color:#E16935">an accident</span> in tomorrow's trial!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, I see now.

So in short...there was a terrible accident at the Great Exhibition showground yesterday.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Yes! Or rather no. The devil is in the details! Strictly speaking, there was a terrible explosion.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Sounds the same to me...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You were demonstrating super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis, weren't you? How fascinating!
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Humans, like all matter, are made up of particles that are held together by electrical bonds. So it must be possible, using a sufficiently high voltage, to break those bonds and beam the particles through space! That's, that's it in a nutshell! That's my idea, you see? That's my amazing hypothesis!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Gosh... That's unimaginably high-level science.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Oh, but dare to imagine it! Dare to dream of such incredible technology! Just think! One moment I could be here in this cell, and the next...I could be at the Great Exhibition again!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, yes! That would be incredible.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
And the next, in the mere blink of an eye, I could be at a great Parisian theatre, say! The possibilities are endless! The whole of our vast planet would be within reach!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...So no more hiding in wardrobes on rocky seas for fifty days?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hm, I don't really see it like that.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean, Iris?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, if you could travel anywhere in the world instantly... ...the planet wouldn't really seem vast any more, would it? I think it would feel like <span style="color:#E16935">it had shrunk</span>.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
My word! That's, that's exactly right! Wh-What are the implications...? What does this mean? .........
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oops, that's got Professor Bunnybrain really worried by the look of it.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Clearly this is yet another case of 'just because you can, doesn't mean you should', I suppose...)</span>
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
The point is, my calculations are flawless! The science works! But without <span style="color:#E16935">a practical demonstration</span>, it means nothing! And that's always the fly in the ointment.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Because practical demonstrations cost a lot of money. Money that young scientists like you don't have.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
That's...that's exactly it, yes.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Hurley's always complaining about it. He says the government should invest more in science.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Well anyway, I bumped into him at the right time. I met the well known investor, Mr Asman!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The victim who died in yesterday's terrible incident, you mean?

...Talk about a leading question, Runo.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
As I said: an unassuming and extremely pleasant gentleman. After all, he is the little darling of the van Zieks family, with all its great aristocratic origins.

He first visited me in my laboratory in Germany a year ago now. He said he wanted to invest in my immaculate hypothesis. I thanked my lucky stars!

An archangel, even! He was prepared to fund a practical demonstration of my hypothesis for presentation at the Great Exhibition! And if that went well, I could expect additional financial support for my research from the British government! Mr Asman provided me with money and an exceptional engineer. He produced a machine to my precise specifications.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But then your dreams were blown to dust in one enormous explosion.

As correct as two squared is four! I swear it! Yes, it's true that the man perished in a machine of my invention. So I know that I'm far from blameless in all this. But still! I would never use my discoveries, my inventions, to take a person's life! Not in a centillion years! I'm a man of science! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Do you believe me?

Tobias Gregson, an inspector at Scotland Yard. Until recently, he was suspended from duty, but it would appear he's back in action now.

Ya can 'ave it back, but I'll 'ave to charge ya for all the bother. Three bob.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
This is Gina Lestrade, a pickpocket, or 'diver', born and bred in the East End of London. In the case that led to my own suspension six months ago... ...this is the young girl I was defending in court.

Wot's yer problem, eh, 'Oddo?! 'Diver'? Pickpocket? Wot's wiv all the name-callin'? You wanna bag o' chips rammed down yer throat an' all, do ya?

I, I thought you were proud to be a diver, Gina? You were just arguing with Inspector Gregson about it, weren't you? I assumed you'd been up to your usual tricks here at the showground.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
That ain't no way to talk to a lady, 'Oddo. 'Alf a year's a long time. People can change. I'm an apprentice now. Learnin' to be a Scotland Yard detective. So you'll 'ave to call me wot everyone else does: It's <span style="color:#E16935">Inspector Lestrade</span> now!

About thirty feet above the ground, apparently. That's what a policeman I just spoke to said.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't really understand 'feet' very well. We don't use them in Japan.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh yes, sorry. It's about nine metres. But soon you'll have been in London a year, Runo. It's time you got used to our measurements.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, well... This thing is so tall, the spectators at the front would just have seen a wall and nothing else!

They probably thought they'd secured the best spot to watch from, only to be disappointed...

The Crystal Tower... It's certainly an apt name. It was built to be the focal point of the exhibition. And it definitely is, being so tall and with all that glass... I can't imagine a building like this ever being erected in Japan.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
There are lots of exhibits inside the tower as well, apparently. Of course there's an observation deck, but there's also an art gallery, a zoo and a museum! But I heard you have to queue for three hours just to get through the doors!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, at the moment, the shattered glass from the failed experiment may well be the biggest draw.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
And thanks to that accident, the whole tower is shut.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Suddenly it's not the Crystal Tower any more, but the Crystal Glass Shower...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Apparently everyone's taking to the skies now to look down on the disaster area from above instead. But there's a three-hour queue to go up in a balloon now.

It was eight months ago now that I first encountered Gina, in connection with a case I was working on. At the time, she was living in the East End with a group of other orphans. She helped all of them survive by pickpocketing, but then she got embroiled in a murder.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I 'ad a lot of time to think in prison. I realised I couldn't go on like I was. The divin' weren't workin' out.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, I'm so pleased to hear it, Ginny! Well done!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...you went from being a pickpocket...to a detective?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
You got it! Good, innit? Inspector Lestrade! Sounds like somefin' out of a book, eh?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Talk about a sea change...)</span>
</p><p>Gina:<br />
And then there's Iris's old man to think about.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Iris's father, you mean?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Yeah. I promised 'er, didn't I? I said I'd get all the police forces 'round the world to pull out all the stops lookin' for 'im.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Just a small promise, then. Nothing serious.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh, Ginny, you're so sweet...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
So anyway, that's 'ow come I 'ad a go at the test for Scotland Yard. Only trouble is, I don't read so well, do I?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Just a small problem. Nothing serious.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
And that's when Hurley approached Gregsy and asked for help. So the inspector said he'd take full responsibility for Ginny and made her a sort of apprentice.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That was very magnanimous of Inspector Gregson. And brave.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, you know Hurley. He enjoys finding ways to make people do what he wants.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The great detective likes digging for dirt, in other words...)</span>
</p><p>Gina:<br />
So, the long and the short of it is, if you've got questions about the case, ya can ask Inspector Lestrade!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Right then...'Inspector'... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Actually, there's still a big <span style="color:#E16935">mystery</span> surrounding Gina, isn't there?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ooh, what, Runo, what?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, six months ago, Gina was the defendant in a trial prosecuted by the Reaper. A trial in which she was found <span style="color:#E16935">not guilty</span>. And yet here she is still...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Come on! Yer not still on about that, are ya? The legend o' the Reaper or wotever it's called. Cor, ya don't 'alf worry, 'Oddo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If I didn't 'half' worry, there probably wouldn't be a 'whole' lot of you left!)</span>
</p><p>Gina:<br />
It's like I told ya before, innit? The Reaper's kind o' like 'Im upstairs. So 'e knows wot I'm like on the inside. That I ain't really done nuffin' wrong.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">('Nothing wrong' might be stretching a point...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What about Mr Natsume in Japan? He's perfectly fine, isn't he?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...that's true. Perhaps the Reaper is more discerning than I thought...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Exactly! So I ain't worried. I'm totally fine!

It looks like layers of thick canvas with a thick rubber lining of sorts. I've never seen anything like it before.

It looks like you wind this around in order to draw the bowstring back and create tension. You must be able to fire arrows with a huge amount of force using this device, then. In fact, I would imagine it's far more accurate and powerful than a Japanese longbow. Ugh... I really had no idea what I was picking up when I spotted this at the exhibition grounds.

Ooh, it must have been a magnificent explosion! And I've seen my fair share.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You've seen things like this before, you mean?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Of course! Hurley's always doing experiments that end in a bang. In fact, in his own words, 'Explosions are the very essence of chemistry!'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...that might explain the smell of burning that frequently comes wafting up the stairs.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
One time, he made something that exploded with such force, it took the roof off the building! I wish you'd been there to see it, Runo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...It's hard to get too excited about that...given that I now live in the roof.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well anyway, that's enough about that. It's time to investigate!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah look, Inspector Gregson is over there. He seems to be deep in thought about something... whilst eyeing up the machine carefully.

Using high-voltage electricity to somehow 'disassemble' a man's body... ...and then beam him across to the Crystal Tower... It's an extraordinary thing to attempt...especially in public.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
True. It was by far the most unusual of the experiments planned for the exhibition, mind.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
To be honest...I'm a bit surprised it was allowed. Carrying out something so dangerous with so many spectators present, I mean.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
The government's doin' everythin' it can to promote new science and technology at the moment. They're more worried about bein' ahead of the game than the odd spot of public safety infringements. If they can be the first to develop some new technology, it makes Britain more powerful in the future, you see.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I suppose that's true, in a way.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
So the powers that be are placin' a heavy emphasis on scientists' <span style="color:#E16935">rights</span> at the moment.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What sort of rights?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
They're makin' it so that any theories the brains have remain their legal 'property', as it were... ...right through developin' it into a practical idea and even goin' into production. Which is the infuriatin' reason us coppers aren't allowed to touch the crime scene! Because the new highfalutin Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act forbids it!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, I see now...
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
The only people with permission to investigate here are from some brand new department at the Yard. The 'Forensic Investigation Team' it's called. We've been relegated to keepin' guard.

Are you havin' me at it, sunshine? It's the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act.

Hm, yes... I think Hurley mentioned that recently. With a real twinkle in his eye as I remember.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I'm sure he did, Your Ladyship, I'm sure he did. Passed especially for this Great Exhibition, it was.

It might be fun to you, but a member of the force has to be present at every single demonstration. Can you imagine, eh? Hang science, that's what I say!

You'd soon think otherwise after spendin' a day guardin' all these shammers' bogus contraptions.

But if they're all bogus, how can anyone hope to demonstrate them? There'd be no point.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yeah, well...there is a point, sadly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Thanks to another of our government's bright ideas. If any theory or invention is deemed to show 'potential', the government hands out <span style="color:#E16935">a research grant</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The scientists get funding?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Exactly. And that's what they're all after. All these shammers comin' from far and wide to clog up Hyde Park. And who has to keep 'em all safe, eh? Who has to smile politely and welcome them? Us coppers, that's who! So you can see why I say it now, can't ya? Hang science! Hang it!

Apparently Professor Harebrayne lives and works in Germany now conducting his research.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
That's right. Came back to Britain especially for the Great Exhibition, as I understand it. Probably after one of the government's research grants. Hmph.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Actually, we learnt something else about the professor earlier today. About his time in further education. It turns out he was at university with someone we both know: Lord van Zieks.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Eh? What's that? That's news to me! But, but if van Zieks mans the prosecution, then as the accused, the professor's fate is...

</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Blimey. That man's beyond me. I dunno what goes on in that head of his. Talkin' of van Zieks, this mornin's paper ran the story of him bein' attacked. Read that?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh yes! But Mr Reaper is completely fine. Nothing to worry about!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Yes, right... Glad to hear it. Still, the Reaper, huh... How long's that business gonna keep up, I wonder?

The victim of this case, the investor, Mr Asman... He was another of the Reaper's victims...or so I heard.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... Lord Barok van Zieks is a top-class prosecutor. But even he can't always push the right verdict through. Sometimes justice can't win.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, I've heard about jurors being bribed and evidence being falsified. And...that's how the notion of the Reaper of the Bailey came about, isn't it?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Obviously, Scotland Yard suspected van Zieks initially. We all assumed he was takin' matters into his own hands if he failed to seal the deal in court.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Although the man himself denies that charge.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Well, we've done a very thorough investigation. And the conclusion we reached... ...is that Lord van Zieks is in no way related to the deaths of those people outside the courtroom. There's no question in my mind. I'd stake my reputation on it, I would.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But if that's true, then how do you explain it? All those defendants couldn't just have coincidentally died if nobody killed them!
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
I know that! But...I can't explain it. It's a mystery, after all, isn't it? That's the whole point of the Reaper.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Professor Harebrayne mentioned something else. He said that at university, Lord van Zieks was a totally different person. Easygoing and kind.
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
You what?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
He said that it was after they both graduated that something happened to change the man. ...Do you have any idea what it was?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
......... No clue.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Really?
</p><p>Gregson:<br />
Look, I've got my hands full watchin' over this frustratin' crime scene. Why don't you go and make a nuisance of yourself elsewhere, eh?

What is this place?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... Madame Tusspells came to London from France three years ago, I understand. Since she opened this little waxwork museum last year, it's enjoyed great popularity in London.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There are museums like this in Japan, too. But these displays are something else! I mean...they aren't made from actual real people, are they?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The extreme realism of these waxwork models is a particular secret of the Tusspells family, they say. They earned renown during the French Revolution for waxworks of victims of the guillotine.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... That sounds grim.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The gruesome scenes were portrayed with such realism in the expressions of the faces of the condemned.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Apparently, the sculptors would make the models directly from the corpses, right there at the site of the executions.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
At the...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(That really turns my stomach...)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
That's just one of several legends about the Tusspells family. Whether there's any truth in it, I couldn't say. But anyway... ...this museum houses models of famous people from all over the globe. Nevertheless, the most popular area of the museum by quite some margin is this <span style="color:#E16935">House of Horrors</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
H-House...of H-H-Horrors...?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Of course, visitor numbers are dwindling now as a result of the Great Exhibition. But people usually flock here to see the exhibits of some of London's most vile criminals at their gruesome work. Naturally, most of the miscreants portrayed here were sent to the gallows. So they're even stiffer now than the models of them! Ah ha ha ha hah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Have you heard of poor taste?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
My dear fellow, the public live for poor taste! They yearn to be shocked.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...the hideous exhibits in here are...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
They're all portrayals of real events that actually took place!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is it just me, or did the temperature in here just seem to drop?)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Anyway, I advise you not to think too deeply about what you see here.

Catching them...?

Every half an hour, I home in on a different killer in one of the displays and adopt a new pose to ensnare him. When members of the public come for a closer look, I offer them my hand to shake. For a shilling, I'll happily allow them to take a photograph with us!

Ah, our friend Mr Reaper. How did you find him? Well, I trust?

Sorry? Have we...? Mr Sholmes, do you know this- <span style="color:#0070C0">(Not again!)</span>
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
My apologies. I am Esmeralda Tusspells. This is my museum of waxwork.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha... You... You're THE Madame Tusspells?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Bien sûr. Though only twenty-six years young, I might add.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Is that significant somehow?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
I'm a 'madame' in name only. It adds a certain...je ne sais quoi.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Right...
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Firstly, I must apologise for my waxworks. Or rather, one waxwork in particular.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That'll be Mr Sholmes, then.)</span>
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />

Did you make all these waxworks, Madame Tusspells?

I did. I am the third generation of waxwork artisans, you know.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Gosh!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
It was my grandmother who began the tradition in my family. Her fortunes were chequered, living through the turbulent times of the French Revolution as she did. Though that is when she acquired the savoir-faire that leads to the astonishing lifelikeness.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
All these waxworks really do look as though they're alive! In fact, they look more alive than Hurley.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Hehe... What you see exhibited here represents the most atrocious of London's criminal past. All the waxworks were created in the presence of the real people on which they are modelled... ...in the hours immediately following their executions. That...is the secret to the extraordinary lifelikeness.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That sounds...terrifying.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
All walks of life have similar challenges, I'm sure. To carry out one's trade par excellence, one must go to extraordinary lengths. My exhibits are a reflection of society. I create only that which the public wishes to see.

It's '<span style="color:#E16935">great detective</span>' actually. He's very specific about it.

Yes, the crème de la crème. So I was keen to come to some arrangement with him, of course. But sadly, we were unable to agree terms.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Regrettably...the museum has a shortage of funds at the moment, due to...unforeseen circumstances. So we came to the current arrangement instead.

Surely he doesn't really need to do what he's doing though, does he?

</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Leaving the exhibit again when you should be working? ...Do you wish to be melted down?

My dear Madame Tusspells, save your reprimands. There are more pressing concerns. The wax can wait. It's our ideas about your current problem we must throw into the melting pot instead!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
...!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Personally, I would advise you not to involve the police.

Why ever not?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She's turned as white as a sheet...)</span>

Because you have at your disposal a great detective, whose services you may employ for a mere fifty shillings. Though please be aware that I prefer- No, I insist upon payment in advance!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
......... ...Very well. Let us see if the great detective is able to live up to his name, shall we?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Before I engage my analytical processes, I must ask you to clarify something. What, pray, is behind the curtain?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
That is the Tusspells Special Exhibit. There is an extra charge to see it.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah, the 'special' exhibit in the House of Horrors... It must depict a special killer then, I presume. Would you be so kind as to draw back the curtain, I wonder?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Ah! Absolument non! There is nothing amiss behind there!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Nothing amiss, madame? What about <span style="color:#E16935">the arm</span> protruding ominously from under the curtain?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I strongly encourage you to allow me to see what lies beyond, before the situation worsens.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
......... Yes, very well. I will draw back the curtains. ...But only a soupçon.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Sholmes:<br />
I must confess, I peeked behind the curtain earlier. The Tusspells Special Exhibit is a very bleak <span style="color:#E16935">graveyard</span> scene indeed. And yet somewhat surprisingly... ...the waxwork killer one would expect is <span style="color:#E16935">nowhere to be seen</span>. What does strike one, however... ...is the portly gentleman lying peacefully on his back on the floor.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, well then perhaps, Mr Sholmes... ...that man on the floor is the ruthless killer himself!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I'm afraid not, my dear fellow. He's a perfectly ordinary London gentleman. Not even a waxwork, in fact.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As skilfully made as these waxworks are, they are always distinguishable from real humans. So, allow me to present my two conclusions. The first... ...is that a sizeable business transaction has been taking place in this special exhibit.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Why...? Why would you say that?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And the second... ...is that the aforementioned transaction is linked to a serious crime!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
AAAAAAH!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She looks as pale as candle wax...)</span>
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
I, I don't understand...

So, Madame Tusspells, as you've agreed to my fee... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work.

<center><b>The Great Deduction</b><br />
The game is afoot!</center>
<p><br />
<b>Topic 1</b><br />
Waxwork's Fate
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
That, that is all my own money!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that <span style="color:#E16935"><b>public notice</b></span>! '<span style="color:#E16935">Waxwork for sale</span>'? Your business has hit hard times, it would seem. In short... ...you sold <span style="color:#E16935">the infamous killer</span> - the centrepiece of your special exhibit - for the sum of two hundred pounds!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Nooooooooon!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>two hundred pounds</b></span>! It would appear that you twisted this gentleman around your little finger most effectively.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
What are you suggesting?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
He rashly agreed to purchase the waxwork for the sum of two hundred pounds. Only when he came to hand the money over, did it occur to him what an extortionate amount he was paying. But the money was no longer in his hands. And the result? The scene we see before us. He collapsed in shock. Yes, the killer in this special exhibit fetched a killer price! We can only pray that the gentleman's dreams are not plagued with regret...
</p><p><b>Topic 1</b><br />
Waxwork's Fate
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
Sold for cash
</p><p><br />
<b>Topic 2</b><br />
Waxwork Location
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
You, you cannot possibly...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his <span style="color:#E16935"><b>neckerchief</b></span>. Such as is worn by policemen as <span style="color:#E16935">a secret sign</span> to fellow members of the force that a crime is being perpetrated. Yes, this young man is an undercover policeman, currently investigating this museum. I know him well, in fact. It's Sergeant John Clay.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
What are you talking about?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The man's quite a celebrity. He received triple accolades at last year's policing awards.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
But...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Ah! But, but you...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious <span style="color:#E16935"><b>price tag</b></span>! 'Thruppence'...? A tragically low price, you might say. Though perhaps the going rate for ageing waxworks riddled with cracks. And yet you sold it to the portly gentleman for an exorbitant two hundred pounds! The sort of plucky behaviour that's sure to attract the attention of Scotland Yard... Isn't that so, madame?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
I, I do not...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes, the waxwork you sold has already been seized by the police and remains in their custody as we speak! The old man must be reunited with his grave in the special exhibit, and not a moment too soon!
</p><p><b>Topic 2</b><br />
Waxwork Location
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
Discovered already
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Iris:<br />
.........
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
.........
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I see I've stunned you all into silence.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
You have, Hurley, you have. And you've obviously upset this young lady in the process. Her cauldron looks awfully hot...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...if I could just bring up one point, Mr Sholmes?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Ah! The notorious Naruhodo 'one point'! I'm all ears, my dear fellow!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
According to your deduction, then, the special exhibit featured this old policeman. So...that would mean that he's the particularly <span style="color:#E16935">ruthless murderer</span>, wouldn't it?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... The killer policeman, Ottermole.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It was a mysterious series of murders that rattled the capital only last year. The police rushed to the scene every time, only to find the culprit had disappeared into the aether.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
And it turned out the culprit was a policeman himself! A senior officer by the name of Ottermole!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you mean that's who the sinister-looking old man there is supposed to be?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed. It is a particularly grim face, is it not? Unforgettable, in fact. Yes, I remember that odious countenance only too well.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But is two hundred pounds a lot of money for a wax model?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It would be enough to afford one of the latest steam carriages, if that puts things in perspective?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
S-So...it is quite a lot then.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
......... Is there anything else you wish to add? Before I melt you down.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That bubbling wax is looking more and more ominous...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Ugh...the smell of all that molten wax is starting to worry me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Sholmes did more or less just accuse her to her face, so... I think I might have to call on your assistance here, Iris, if that's alright? To make some minor corrections to the great detective's great deductions...
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Of course it's alright! We'll soon set things straight!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...let's get started then, shall we? Before Madame Tusspells vents her anger!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Just what I was waiting to hear, my dear fellow! So, Madame Tusspells, in accordance with our agreement... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work.
</p>
<hr />
<center><b>Course Correction</b><br />
Hold it, Mr Sholmes!</center>
<p><b>Topic 1</b><br />
Waxwork's Fate
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
Sold for cash
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
She definitely looked in this direction, it's true.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But I'm not sure she'd sell any of her waxworks, even for two hundred pounds.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
She must pour her heart and soul into making them, don't you think? Over and above the wax. If it were me, I wouldn't sell them for anything.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(For that much money, I would! ...But it sounds like that makes me a bad person.)</span> W-Well anyway... ...I wonder if the two hundred pounds could have some other significance.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Let's follow that <span style="color:#E16935">furtive glance</span> again and see if there's anything else that could explain it!

I remember it all too well myself. That feeling the day after the elation and excitement of the festival... The bitter resentment of spending far too much money on some shabby toy when I was swept up in the mood. Which is exactly how this gentleman felt as he realised the two hundred pounds was excessive for a waxwork.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...yes, that's true.

As a logician, you will never surpass me. The science of deduction and analysis requires long and patient study. I'm several steps ahead of you. And your attempts to correct me serve only to highlight your deficiencies.

At first glance, Madame Tusspells's hands look slender and delicate. But obviously all the waxwork modelling she does has made them big and strong! She could easily have knocked that man out, just with a single punch.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
In that case, perhaps I should ask that she knocks some sense into you.

<p>What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the <span style="color:#E16935"><b>two hundred pounds</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It must have been a considerable blow to have knocked the man unconscious.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Yes, he looks like a very sturdy man, doesn't he? Ooh! Perhaps he was struck on the back of the head with something hard?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>waxwork hand</b></span>!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed. With a solid waxwork limb, one could deliver a very substantial blow.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
How, how could you...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The hand protruding from the bottom of your cape... It ought to be a right hand, but closer inspection reveals that in fact, it's <span style="color:#E16935">a left hand</span>.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And somewhat masculine as well. In other words, it does not belong to you, madame. It is the hand of a waxwork model!
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
KYAAAAAAH! Some of the visitors to my museum can be...troublesome. They meddle with the exhibits and cause damage.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So you mean, that arm...?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Yes. This gentleman saw fit to try to remove it as a souvenir.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Hm, no small keepsake.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Like taking a whole branch of a cherry tree when you go to view the blossoms...
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
I am afraid I had to teach the man a lesson.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You confronted the man and tried to take the arm back.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And the result? The scene we see before us. He was knocked unconscious. A point we may need to revisit later. But for the time being, we have our <span style="color:#E16935">conclusion</span>: Yes, the killer in this special exhibit has been kidnapped!

<p><br />
<b>Topic 2</b><br />
Waxwork Location
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
Discovered already
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
You, you cannot possibly...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his <span style="color:#E16935"><b>neckerchief</b></span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
According to Mr Sholmes... ...the yellow neckerchief is <span style="color:#E16935">a sign</span> to other policemen that some crime is underway.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
A way of communicating with his colleagues without revealing his identity, yes. It's a secret that's closely guarded by Scotland Yard.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That Mr Sholmes didn't hesitate to give away.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Well, uncovering secrets is in any true detective's nature, of course.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Right... Anyway, judging from Madame Tusspells's reaction to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...I think perhaps we might not have identified the man quite correctly.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
According to Mr Sholmes, this young gentleman is actually a policeman in plain clothes. And the secret scarf sign appears to back that idea up. It does seem plausible.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
But Madame Tusspells's reaction was strange. Which must mean...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>shoulder stub</b></span>.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
No such boneless human walks this earth. Of that, I can assure you. In other words, the man standing here - the young Sergeant John Clay... ...is in fact, defying all odds, a waxwork model!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I seem to remember it was you who concluded he was a real person in the first place, Mr Sholmes.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
He has become quite a celebrity in London, being the winner of no less than three policing awards last year. I simply had to make a model of the man.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Naturally! What other explanation could there be?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And it was this detective's arm that was pulled off by the man on the floor in the special exhibit, wasn't it?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Ah! But, but you...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious <span style="color:#E16935"><b>price tag</b></span>!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A killer policeman...called Ottermole, was it? Was he well known?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It was all over the papers last year. But I can't say I know what he looks like. It's a very low price, though. Thruppence isn't much money.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Only enough for a few measly hours of gas in Mr Garrideb's delightful lodgings, in fact...)</span> So this is the special killer taken from the special exhibit...is it? The waxwork that somebody stole from the museum and tried to ransom for two hundred pounds... ...is this crusty old killer policeman Ottermole? Really?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Perhaps we should have a good look around again and see if another idea crops up!

You only have to look at this price tag to know exactly what this old man really is! He's a waxwork being sold for thruppence. It really couldn't be more obvious!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...yes, that's true.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
As a logician, you will never surpass me. The science of deduction and analysis requires long and patient study. I'm several steps ahead of you. And your attempts to correct me serve only to highlight your deficiencies.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
According to you, Mr Sholmes, a scarf like this is a secret sign used between undercover detectives. So perhaps THIS is the famous plain clothes detective, Sergeant John Clay.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Mr Naruhodo, pray...what part of this man's outfit would you call 'plain clothes'?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And I believe I described the man as young, too.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It was only last year that I saw him being awarded his triple accolades at the policing awards. They say detective work can age a man, but this would be extreme, I'm sure you'll agree.

<p>The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious <span style="color:#E16935"><b>price tag</b></span>!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
If we just poured a little bit of molten wax on him, we'd soon find out if he was real or not.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...you never know, there may be another way. We've already come this far, so maybe we should stick to logical deductions, don't you think?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Alright, if that's the way you want to do it, then we should examine him in more detail.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious <span style="color:#0070C0"><b>twitch</b></span>!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Even the most realistic waxworks do not exhibit a twitch. In other words, this splendid old man is in fact a genuine member of Scotland Yard!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Slight shift in your choice of adjectives, then...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And there you have it! Well, Madame Tusspells?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Well what? It was me who contacted the police and demanded that someone come in the first place. He is clearly fatigued. He is sound asleep.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But then, what's this tag about showing a price of three pence?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
No doubt the price tag of the muffler, which the old bobby purchased recently at a local market. And I presume you've observed the scarf tied around his arm? Does that not strike you, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! <span style="color:#E16935">The secret sign</span> used by detectives to show that some criminal activity is currently underway.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
Of course. Because, as you know, there has been just such <span style="color:#E16935">criminal activity</span> happening here. As you deduced from the very beginning, detective.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So, it would seem that we finally arrive at the truth.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The waxwork of the especially <span style="color:#E16935">ruthless killer</span> from the special exhibit has been kidnapped.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And Scotland Yard are already investigating. But the model's whereabouts remain a mystery. Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle!

All sorts of people visit my museum here. Men and women, young and old. Sometimes they drop in just for a short time on their way back from the pub. I welcome them all. But if anyone tries to damage my exhibits... I do not take it lightly. Anyway... ...your great deduction was even more enchanting than I had been led to believe.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It was a pleasure, my dear madame. I'm gratified that you enjoyed the spectacle. And as for your 'rough customer', I've no doubt he'll regain consciousness shortly and return home. What concerns me more... ...is the waxwork from the special display...if it was indeed genuinely abducted?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
......... Yes. Tragically, it was...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Then I would ask you to recount to us the events surrounding the stolen waxwork. In as much detail as possible, if you please.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
...Very well. But after I have told you what I know, I must insist that you return to your work.

Tell us more about the stolen waxwork, please.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
It was some days ago now, when I came in here one morning. I immediately noticed that a waxwork was missing from the special exhibit here!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
It is your most prominent display. So...that's why the curtains were closed.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
And I found the ransom note in its place.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The culprit must have broken in during the night and taken it, then?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So this waxwork that was stolen... It was a model of some horrible criminal, I suppose?
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
......... Of a particularly horrible criminal, in fact. The killer who left a more profound scar on society than any other, I would say: <span style="color:#E16935">the Professor</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Not a name I've heard of.)</span>
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
So, Mr Naruhodo...it seems the circle is complete.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Iris:<br />
The Professor case happened at around the time I was born, didn't it?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Indeed it did, Iris. Ten years ago. <span style="color:#E16935">A series of murders</span> that rocked the capital.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ten years ago?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Yes. At exactly the time... ...that Barok van Zieks graduated from university, in fact.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What? <span style="color:#0070C0">(S-Surely he's not saying...?)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br />
So the big event that changed Mr Reaper's life...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... As you've surmised. It was the Professor case.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Who was this Professor then?

It was <span style="color:#E16935">a series of gruesome murders</span> that had all of London gripped in terror a decade ago. After five victims were killed, the man was arrested, and put to death.
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
And now he's immortalised here in wax for all Londoners to admire and enjoy! Though of course, he happens to be absent at present, on account of the abduction.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But I don't understand. How is all this related to Lord van Zieks?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
......... You must first understand, my dear fellow, why it is that the Professor earnt such infamy. It was due to <span style="color:#E16935">the victims</span> he chose. Some of Whitehall's finest.
</p><p>Iris:<br />
What do you mean, Hurley?
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Those murdered by the Professor were some of the highest members of the British aristocracy. Members of the nobility. Even royalty. It sent shockwaves through the country's administration.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Members of the... Ah! Wait! Of course! What Professor Harebrayne said! Lord van Zieks is from a family with <span style="color:#E16935">noble blood</span>!
</p><p>Iris:<br />
Oh gosh!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
It was the fifth victim that led to the Professor's arrest. The last of the killer's prey was a young noble by the name of... ...Klint van Zieks.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No! I don't believe it! Van Zieks?!
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
I'm sure you can piece together the rest for yourself. In the wake of his older brother's murder, the young Barok pursued a career as a prosecutor. And eventually...became the Reaper we know today.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I had no idea Lord van Zieks had such a tragic past...
</p><p>Sholmes:<br />
Well, I'm afraid that's all I can say on the matter. For the time being at least. After all, I have work to do... ...as a waxwork exhibit.
</p><p>Tusspells:<br />
I am afraid I shall have to excuse myself as well.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, yes, of course. It's, it's been a pleasure. Thank you.

<hr />
<p>???:<br />
...Well, none of the predicted scenarios I've been analysing involved you coming to visit me here.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
It's been too long, it really has. I'm delighted to see you, Barok.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It's been ten years. And here we are, meeting in a prison of all places.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
I can't forgive myself for what happened to Mr Asman! I just can't! I, I still can't believe it could happen...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Tomorrow the court will decide.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Yes! I have a young Eastern man acting for my defence. He seems reliable enough, though. It, it was an accident. A terrible accident. He, he, he assures me he can prove it!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I must warn you...
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Oh, I know, I know! I've heard already. You're going to be prosecuting, aren't you?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Yes.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
......... Since I returned to England, I've heard lots of stories. Barok, are you really...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
......... Never mind. I know that you have my best interests at heart.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My friend is on trial. ...I wouldn't entrust it to anybody else.
</p><p>Harebrayne:<br />
Of course. I fully understand. Thank you, Barok.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Until tomorrow, then. I'll see you in court.
