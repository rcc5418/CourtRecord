<p>Apollo:<br />
I'm fine... I'm fine... I'm Apollo Justice, and I'm fine...
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
Is Apollo okay? He's been muttering to himself all morning...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
He's been like that since yesterday. Guess the pressure of today's trial is getting to him.
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
Poor Polly... He's really tearing himself up over all of this.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Get it together, Apollo!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yikes! Athena! Wh-When did you get here?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Try to relax a little bit, will you? You're getting yourself way too worked up.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Y-Yeah... But I'm all right. I'm fine!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
You know, I did a little digging on this Nahyuta Sahdmadhi guy... He's apparently not your run-of-the-mill prosecutor.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...Oh, yeah? What did you find out?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Well, they say he wields an incredible power... ...<span style="color:#E16935">to accurately read a trial's karma and its ultimate fate</span>.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What is THAT supposed to mean?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I don't have all the details, but apparently... ...he can foresee how the arguments will go, and even lead his opposition. So the defense basically ends up going in whatever direction he has in his head
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...Man, this isn't going to be a cake walk, if that's true...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Ema DID say she'd talk to him for us, though. Here's hoping that went well.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(In any case, it sounds like he's going to keep us on our toes.)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<center>That's why I know you're ready, why I know I can leave Trucy and the office to you. ...I believe in you, Apollo.</center>
<hr />
<p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Mr. Wright is putting his faith in me. I can't let him down now!)</span> I'm fine... I'm fine. I'm fine!
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
There he goes again. It's almost like he's chanting a prayer.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I'm fine... I'm fine... I'm Apollo Justice, and I'm fine!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
If you say so, Apollo...
</p><p>Guard:<br />
The trial will start momentarily. Is the defense ready?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes! WE'RE FINE! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Trucy's fate and the fate of the agency rest on this trial... This is it, Justice! If ever there was a time to shine, it's now!)</span>
</p>

District Court - Courtroom No. 6</span></center><p><br />
</p><center><b>Day 1</b></center>
<center><b>Court Is Now In Session</b></center>
<center><b>All Rise</b></center>
<p>Judge:<br />
Court is now in session for the trial of Trucy Wright.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
............
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And the prosecution?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
............
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Um, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi...?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...A thousand pardons. It was rude of me to keep you waiting. I was praying for the victim.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh! Praying... Yes. Yes, I see. You're a Khura'inist monk, correct, Prosecutor?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Yes, that is correct. I am but a lowly monk from the Kingdom of Khura'in. I beg in advance for the forgiveness and kind patience of everyone here in this court. I am unfamiliar with the proceedings of this country, and may make many blunders.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Hmm... He seems like such a gentle-mannered soul, doesn't he?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I wonder if Ema had a chance to talk with him about Trucy...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now then, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, your opening statement, if you would.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Certainly. In the name of the Holy Mother... ...I vow to guide the victim's soul to a land of eternal peace known as the Twilight Realm. Now, let the last rites of the victim begin.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Nahyuta Sahdmadhi... He's really been making a name for himself apparently, but... ...that nickname -- "Last Rites Prosecutor"... I wonder how that will come into play today.)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
The incident took place in the middle of a spectacular magic show. The accused performed a magic trick in which she thrust a sword into a coffin... ...a coffin from which the body of the victim then spilled out -- dead from a fatal stabbing. The victim's name was <span style="color:#E16935">Manov Mistree</span>, otherwise known as "The Great Mr. Reus." <span style="color:#E16935">His blood</span> was found on the sword that was used during the magic trick.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So his death was just an unfortunate accident?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It is only natural for one to assume as such, Your Honor... ...however, it was no mere accident, but rather... a homicide. The prosecution's position is thus: that this was a murder made to look like an accident.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I see. And you believe this crime was committed by the defendant?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...After a thorough consideration of all possible scenarios... ...I, unfortunately, had no other choice but to conclude as much.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So that's how it's going to be, huh...)</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I guess Ema couldn't convince him after all...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Very well. And now, let us hear from the defense.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Naturally, we maintain that the defendant is innocent, Your Honor.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...If the defense wouldn't mind... ...could you please explain your reasoning?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
My reasoning...? Um, well... I would have to say that my main reason is because... I believe in the defendant.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...I see. So you find it difficult to come up with anything more concrete than that, do you? What a fine demonstration of the fact that you are indeed a lawyer of <span style="color:#E16935">putrid mind.</span>
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
..."P-Putrid mind"...?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
E-Excuse me, but I don--
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />

</p><p>Judge:<br />
...If you don't mind my asking, Prosecutor, what was that you were just chanting?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
A sutra of the Holy Mother that guides those of tainted soul toward enlightenment. It is a Khura'inist incantation to awaken the foolish from their fruitless slumber. Fitting for a lawyer who indulges in such fancy as the innocence of the accused.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I-I see... So basically, you're asking the defense to "get real"?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Allow me these few words, defense. It is my duty as a monk to punish sinners, and to guide victims' souls to the Twilight Realm. Should you show repentance and admit to the accused's guilt now, no harm will come to you. But... should you interfere with my sacred last rites for the victim... ...then I shall cast you down into the pit of hell, along with Trucy Wright!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
............N-Now wait just one minute here! "Putrid"?! "Pit of hell"?! Is that any way to address someone in a court of law?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... That may be the way you conduct trials in Khura'in... ...but I would appreciate it if you would refrain from such charged language here.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Your Honor, that was but a Khura'inist sermon for those who have strayed from the path. Harsh words are often necessary to admonish contemptible deviants who cannot see reason.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
O-Oh, I see... I-I didn't realize...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I guess they really do hate defense attorneys in Khura'in, huh. Even still, that was way, way over the top as far as verbal abuse goes.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
And the trial's only just begun...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Well, defense, I suppose the way a prosecutor does things varies by country. Why don't we look at this as cross-cultural exchange and try to be open-minded about it?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Bailiff, please bring in the first witness.

</p><p>Ema:<br />
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH

</p><p>Ema:<br />
......What's wrong with having a little snack? Girl's gotta eat, right?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
She, uh, seems a little stressed out.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Detective Skye, your testimony, please.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
Y-Yeah, about that... I just want to state for the record that... I believe Trucy Wright is innocent!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I-I'm sorry?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Detective Skye, this path you seek to follow is misguided. Giving the wrongdoer false hope will only deepen her despair in the end.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
But I...!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Let it go, and move on. Acts which go against your duty will earn you <span style="color:#E16935">divine punishment</span> from the Holy Mother.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
! ............MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH CHEW CHEW CHEW... ...Fine. I don't know about the "divine" part, but I get the "<span style="color:#E16935">punishment</span>" bit loud and clear...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I guess Ema got assigned tons of paperwork or something for sticking up for Trucy...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
She and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi don't seem to get along very well, do they?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Shall we continue? The prosecution contends that the accused had a clear motive. The evidence, if you would, Detective Skye.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
All right... Please take a look at this poster. It's a Troupe Gramarye poster from thirteen years ago.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Hm?&amp; Is it just me or is it a little different from the one in Ms. Wright's dressing room?
</p><p>Ema:<br />
This is a revised version of that poster.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
This one says "<span style="color:#E16935">CANCELED</span>" under Mr. Reus.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
That's right. Mr. Reus left the troupe after the first version of the poster was printed. Take a look at Mr. Reus's right forearm, near his elbow. See the <span style="color:#E16935">big scar</span> there? He apparently got that when he made a mistake while practicing a magic trick.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ouch. That's quite a scar...)</span>
</p><p>Ema:<br />
Because of the accident, Magnifi Gramarye concluded Mr. Reus was too unskilled. Just before the show was to open, Magnifi announced Mr. Reus wouldn't be appearing. But in defiance of Magnifi's decision, Mr. Reus tried to go on stage anyway. This, in turn, caused Magnifi to <span style="color:#E16935">oust</span> Mr. Reus from the troupe on the spot.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
He kicked Mr. Reus out? That seems rather extreme. Did he really have to go that far?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
When it came to magic, Troupe Gramarye was so passionate... ...or should I say "extreme," about it that it caused problems for them from time to time.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, they even caused this court a mountain of trouble with their extreme antics.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
And now, the troupe's successor has committed a murder. It seems the troupe's rare talent was inherited by the right person after all. <span style="color:#E16935">A putrid talent for criminality.</span>
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
............
</p><p>............
</p><p>Judge:<br />
............Y-You sound rather extreme yourself, Prosecutor.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Criminals with impure souls do not deserve sympathy, Your Honor.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
Ahem! As I was saying... After his expulsion, Mr. Reus apparently went on to hold a grudge against the troupe. He would tell those close to him, "<span style="color:#E16935">I will get my revenge on Troupe Gramarye someday!</span>"
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Revenge, hmm? That certainly sounds antagonistic.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Thirteen-Year-Old Poster updated in the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
And then, his chance for revenge finally came. If you would be so kind, Detective Skye?
</p><p>Ema:<br />
...I guess I don't have a choice, do I?
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- The Defendant's Motive --</span></center>
<p>Ema:<br />
The victim planned to get his revenge on Troupe Gramarye during Trucy's magic show.<br />
Mr. Reus was going to first steal the Gramarye notebook from the defendant.<br />
He then intended to reveal the secrets behind their magic tricks during the show.<br />
That was the victim's plan for revenge. And while he did, in fact, steal the notebook...<br />
...the defendant murdered him before he had a chance to reveal the secrets.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Nahyuta:<br />
By the time the accused had discovered the notebook's theft, it was too late. Her only option was to kill Mr. Reus, and make it look like an accident.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That's nothing but conjecture!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615182206" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Objection!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/f/f9/SoJ_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615182206" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
The victim's assistant, Bonny de Famme, gave the police a statement. She testified that just before the start of the show, Mr. Reus said... "I'm going to reveal all of Troupe Gramarye's secrets on stage today!"
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Hmm... Well, that isn't exactly a great starting point for a rebuttal, is it...?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You're telling me...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Allow me to give you one piece of advice, defense.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oh? And what's that?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Let it go, and move on.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Excuse me?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Helping a sinner will only sully your own soul. One possessed of an unclean soul will burn in the flames of hell... ...and then be ever burdened with that sin in their next life.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
B-But I don't believe in that sort of thing... Besides, I have no intention of giving up!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
O Holy Mother, grant me the strength to deal with this putrid lawyer. All actions have consequences, and yours will surely earn you the honor of being... ...a mere stink bug, at best, in your next life.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
A stink bug?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now then, Mr. Stink Bu-- I mean, Mr. Justice. Your cross-examination, please.

Let the detective have her snack. This humble servant of the Holy Mother shall explain. Over a decade ago, Troupe Gramarye was at the height of their popularity. But then their reputation declined, and they had all but faded from public memory. Until recently, that is, when Trucy Wright sought to recapture their former glory.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The defendant? And at such a young age, too! How impressive!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Yes, the accused's skill at magic is undeniably impressive. If she hadn't fallen onto the path of sin, she would have had a bright future ahead of her.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... It's always sad to see such promising young potential go to waste... Now, then, Detective Skye. How did Mr. Reus plan to get his revenge? And please put down the Snackoos before you continue with your testimony.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. ...Yes, Your Honor.

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Mr. Reus, who was waiting in the understage passage... ...was supposed to have used the upstage ladder, shown here on the left. He was to climb up into the coffin that had been set up in the backstage area. After being turned into a stuffed dragon during Act One... ...Mr. Reus was supposed to come back to life and emerge from that coffin. But the luminous tape had been moved to mark the downstage ladder... ...so the victim climbed up into the coffin on the stage itself by mistake.

I'm sorry, Detective Skye, but there's a flaw in your testimony.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
Oh! Really?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
The prosecution is claiming that Ms. Wright moved the understage tape during the show... ...in order to guide the victim into the coffin downstage. But it doesn't make sense that she would leave prints on the tape at that time.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It doesn't?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Please consider the fingerprinting results of the main coffin... ...which shows that not one of my client's fingerprints was found on or in it.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
That's true... We didn't find any of her prints on that coffin. ............Hm?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I think you've realized what the flaw in your testimony is. Claiming Ms. Wright left prints on the tape during the show is inconsistent with the facts. Because she was wearing <span style="color:#E16935">gloves</span> during the show.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
She must've left the prints sometime BEFORE the show started. In other words, her prints do NOT prove she moved the tape to mislead the victim. The prosecution's investigation was insufficient!
</p><p>Ema:<br />
Oh, my! ............But, on a personal level, I'm very happy about that!
</p><p>Judge:<br />

If the defense wishes to be promoted to a stag beetle... ...then answer me this question.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
All right. Shoot.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Even with no evidence that the accused moved the tape to misguide the victim... ...the victim still climbed the ladder, using the tape as a guide... ...and entered the coffin on the stage. The accused then thrust her sword into said coffin with the victim in it.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So what you're saying is, the fact remains that the victim was stabbed to death, right?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Precisely. However, this does drastically change one aspect of this case: If the accused did not lead the victim into the coffin on purpose... ...then it means the victim's death could have been <span style="color:#E16935">accidental</span>. If it was indeed an accident, the defense can argue that it was <span style="color:#E16935">involuntary manslaughter</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I see... If it was involuntary manslaughter, they could plead extenuating circumstances. And <span style="color:#E16935">the severity of the crime could be mitigated</span>.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Defense, if you believe the accused did not murder the victim... ...then do you argue that it was an accident?

Hmph. That is quite a brazen claim to make -- and one wholly without grounds. our voice is as loud as your suit, and your mind echoes just as loudly in emptiness. Surely, you were but a loud red pepper in your previous life.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I've been demoted to a vegetable?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Wow... I didn't know a person could be reincarnated as a non-sentient plant...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I-In any case! I DO have grounds to make this claim!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
............Let us hear this reasoning of yours, then.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
All right. But before I give it, there is one question that we need to address. If the victim was killed by some third party... ...then the sword the defendant thrust into the coffin wasn't the cause of death. If that's the case, then how did we wind up with a dead body inside the coffin?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now let's hear your opinion, Mr. Justice. <span style="color:green">How did the victim's body wind up inside the coffin?</span>

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Hrnh!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Owowowowow! M-My heaaaaaaaad! What do you think you're doing?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
"Even the merciful Holy Mother loses patience if she is struck three times." Since you never learn, you needed to be punished.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Why don't you let ME worry about what I need and don't need?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It is what you deserve for interfering with my sacred last rites for the victim. You are a brainless lawyer chasing phantoms. You know nothing. Let this humble servant of the Holy Mother give you an edifying <span style="color:#E16935">sermon</span>.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
A sermon? Now?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
There is a passage in the sacred scriptures of Khura'inism. "<span style="color:#E16935">A cornered frog will swallow even a snake.</span>"
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........A cornered lawyer has unexpectedly struck back hard against the prosecution. Did I get it right?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
No, for I am not done with my sermon. "<span style="color:#E16935">And yet, the frog still dies, its belly bitten and torn from within.</span>"
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Just great...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
And in this case, you are that frog, defense.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...Um, what exactly is your point, anyway?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Let us assume for a moment that the victim was killed under the stage. <span style="color:#E16935">Who</span>, then, had the <span style="color:#E16935">opportunity</span> to do so during the show?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Let's see... The people in the show were...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Bonny de Famme, the victim Mr. Reus, and Trucy Wright. Bonny de Famme was onstage throughout the entire show... ...as easily confirmed by the footage from the show. Which leaves us with only one suspect: Trucy Wright.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Agnk!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Now do you see? The accused killed Mr. Reus as he waited on standby in the understage passage... ...and then placed his dead body in the coffin above. Thus making the murder look like an accident!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Nooooooooooooooooo!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
O great and merciful Holy Mother... Thus, another putrid mind has been guided toward enlightenment.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />

</p><p>Athena:<br />
Sorry, but I have to raise an objection here!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Athena? What are you...?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
There's something I want to point out, Apollo.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
And who might you be? You strike me as a mere child in countenance.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I may be young... ...but I have an attorney's badge just the same!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
And you would contribute to this discussion in that capacity?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I most certainly would! You just argued that the defendant killed the victim under the stage. But let me remind you that Ms. Wright... is a girl.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Clearly. Surely you didn't raise an objection simply to point out such an obvious fact? Your Honor, please send for this little child's guardian to come take her home.
</p><p>Athena:<br />

</p><p>Athena:<br />
B-But I'm not done with my sermon!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You don't need to talk like Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, you know.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Listen. If the victim was killed in the understage passage... ...then his body would then have to be hauled up to the <span style="color:#E16935">stage</span>, right? However... ...Ms. Wright is a young girl -- and a pretty petite one, at that. She couldn't possibly have hefted that large body up and put it in the coffin!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That's true! It does seem like it would be a rather difficult task for the defendant... I don't think even I could do it.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
What do you think of that, Prosecutor?! Who's the child now?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
In my religion, the priestesses of Khura'inism are revered as the pillars of our beliefs. So I naturally hold nothing but deep respect for women. I also think highly of the female perspective.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Says the man who called this fair maiden a "little child"...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Who's a "fair maiden"...?)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I agree that your point is worth discussing, defense. How, indeed, was the dead body raised up into the coffin? By the accused, Trucy Wright, that is.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
You're committed to pointing the finger at her no matter what, huh! Then YOU explain how that'd even be possible!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
But of course. There was <span style="color:#E16935">a way for even a small creature like her to raise the victim's body up</span>.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
...Wait! You really CAN explain it?!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I foresaw that our arguments would come to this, so I have prepared a witness.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, well. I admire your readiness, Prosecutor.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It is really not that difficult when one can read the ultimate outcome of any trial.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
He couldn't have REALLY predicted that things would turn out like this, could he?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's pretty hard to believe...)</span>
</p><p>Ema:<br />
...Excuse me, but may I step down now?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Yes, I suppose you may.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
One moment, Detective Skye.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
! U-Um... I'm sorry... for, you know... the way I handled all of this...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
You did a fine job, Detective. Your testimony was invaluable.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
It was?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Yes. You served well as a detective, and did not allow your personal feelings to interfere. You overcame the conflicted emotions you felt and performed your duty admirably. You will be rewarded for your fine work.
</p><p>Ema:<br />
............Oh! Uh, thank you.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I hope we can work together again in the future.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ema seems bewildered by the unexpected praise.)</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I guess he's a pretty nice person like they say -- as long as you're not up against him.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, then. Let us call the next witness.

Please, witness... There is a time and a place for all things, including magic.

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
That is your second time...
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
My second time doing what?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...There will be no further warnings. You should know that from our preparatory meeting, correct?
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Yeep!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is no one exempt from His Holiness's rosary of suffering...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
May we have your testimony, witness? Once you've recovered from your disappointment...
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Well, as a huge fan of Trucy's... ...I don't really want to testify against her... But I guess I have to... don't I?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(As a "huge fan of Trucy's," huh...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Bonny:<br />
I hate her. I LOATHE her! I can't stand that Trucy Wright! Just because she's a little good at magic, she thinks she's all that! So this is exactly what that sniveling brat deserves!

<p>Bonny:<br />
I really can't believe that Trucy killed Mr. Reus...<br />
I guess it's possible for a small girl to lift a dead body up if she used a stage lift...<br />
Is it possible...? Could Trucy really have...?<br />
If Trucy did use a stage lift, I think she must've used stage lift #2...<br />
I was onstage for the entire show, by the way.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Apollo:<br />
You were onstage the whole time...? And you're sure about that?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
There is no question. The entire audience could testify to that fact. What's more, she is shown clearly in the TV show footage as well.
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
I couldn't possibly have killed Mr. Reus! Not little old me!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Therefore, the only person who could have killed the victim understage is the accused. Furthermore, by using a stage lift, even a petite young lady... ...could have raised the body up to the stage without difficulty.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You've gotta be kidding me...)</span>

Very well. The defense may now cross-examine the witness.

Stage lift #2? You mean the stage lift shown here on the left?
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
That's right. With a stage lift... ...I'd think even a small girl could easily lift a dead body up to the stage.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />

Ms. de Famme, to what is the defense referring?

W-Well, I made a little mistake on stage... I was in charge of operating Mr. Hat, you see. According to the script, I was supposed to place him to the left of the coffin. But I flubbed it up, and made him stand to the right of the coffin instead.

A place where the more one struggles, the further one falls into the abyss. At the bottom of the abyss, a ferocious beast awaits. Think of it as something akin to an <span style="color:#E16935">antlion's sand pit trap</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, there's one of those in my backyard!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Wow. Khura'inist hell is closer to home than I thought...

</p><p>Judge:<br />
She is?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Yes, what with that terrible death on stage... ...and her beloved Trucy getting arrested, she's under awful strain and shock. In fact, I don't know how much more she can take before she is unfit to testify.
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I've heard of that. What is it called? "<span style="color:#E16935">Postal Stress Disorder</span>," right? It's where a person becomes uncontrollably angry, I think... I read about it somewhere.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
...That's "going postal," Your Honor. This is <span style="color:#E16935">PTSD</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, my. So that's why the witness acts so hostile at times -- as if she were a different person.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Yes. And I think her condition is clouding her memory of the incident. Therefore, I suggest a short therapy session for the witness!

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ms. Cykes, please do whatever you can to help this unfortunate young lady.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
And what exactly is this child planning to do, Mr. Justice?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
With her super-sensitive hearing, Ms. Cykes can hear <span style="color:#E16935">a witness's true emotions</span>. Simply from tone and inflection, she can tell exactly what a person is feeling.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I can even pick out feelings that a witness is trying to suppress or hide. <span style="color:#E16935">Widget</span> projects the emotions I hear into the <span style="color:#E16935">Mood Matrix</span>, where I can analyze them.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It sounds like some sort of spurious devilry. Though I find it hard to believe, I must ask: How do emotions constitute evidence?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... While I won't say that emotions can be taken as evidence, per se... ...I have seen how instrumental Ms. Cykes's work has been in cracking a case. Therefore, I wholly support giving it a try.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...I see. If you are in favor of it, Your Honor, then I have no objections. Even this mere monk can see that something disturbs the witness.
</p><p>Bonny:<br />

</p><p>Athena:<br />
Oh, thank you for understanding, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Apollo, you remember how to conduct a therapy session, right?

</p><p>Athena:<br />
Of course. You're the lead on this case, after all.

<p>Apollo:<br />
Okay, but I think I could use a refresher. So Bonny's <span style="color:#E16935">emotions</span> are shown here in the Mood Matrix, right?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Exactly. The emotions I pick up on from her testimony are projected into this program. The Mood Matrix gives a visual representation of a witness's testimony and emotions. These four mood markers reflect fluctuations in a witness's emotions. As testimony unfolds, the mood markers flash in reaction to the witness's feelings. When the witness feels happy or is enjoying the memory, the "<span style="color:green">Happy</span>" marker will light up. When the witness feels angry or frustrated, the "<span style="color:red">Angry</span>" marker will react. When the witness feels sad or is scared by a memory, the "<span style="color:#0070C0">Sad</span>" marker will blink. And when the witness feels surprised or confused, the "<span style="color:#DDDD00">Surprised</span>" marker will tell us.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Okay. I remember now. I need to find a conflict between what she's saying and which mood markers are blinking?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
That's right. And Ms. de Famme definitely has some conflicted emotions! See?

<center><b>NOISE LEVEL</b><br /><b>100%</b></center>
<p>Athena:<br />
Widget reacts to the suppressed emotions I pick up and projects them as noise.

When you find an unexpected emotion, touch "<span style="color:#E16935">Pinpoint</span>" (L)... ...and then select the unexpected emotion or reaction from the four mood markers.

Keep that up, Ms. de Famme, and you're going to have a mental breakdown. Just let yourself be <span style="color:#E16935">who you really are</span>!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Wh-Who I really am?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
The <span style="color:#E16935">two sides of you</span> are fighting each other and doing you psychic harm. I can hear them -- two distinct voices battling inside you.
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Sh-Shut your pie hole, you know-nothing know-it-all! Urk! I-I mean, you mustn't say things like that, or I might get flustered!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Ms. de Famme, how long do you insist on maintaining this wolf in sheep's clothing act? We can't end this therapy session until you get real with us. Set the wild beast inside you free!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Ouch. Urrgh... ...Grrrrr!
</p>
<center>............</center>
<p>............Heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Don't make me laugh! You don't know a dang thing about me. You wanna see who I really am? Fine! Take a good look!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Kee hee hee... Kee kee kee kee!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Wh-What in the world...?!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Sheep's clothing?! You've got it all wrong! It's a rabbit suit I've got on! And I'm not a wolf. I'm a blood-sucking vampire! A bat with fangs and wings! Kee hee hee! Kee kee kee kee kee!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Eeeeeek! I-I think we just opened Pandora's box...
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Kee kee kee kee! I'm finally done with that goody-two-shoes cottontail act! I feel free as a bat! Kee kee kee!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Defense! Your "therapy session" has taken a turn for the worse, from the looks of it!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Th-There's... a perfectly good explanation for this... isn't there, Ms. Cykes?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Um... Eh heh... Methinks I created a monster...
</p><p>Widget:<br />
<span style="color:olive">We blew it!</span>
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Hey, you! Lobster boy!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Wh-Who, ME?!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
You think I'm glad Trucy is in trouble -- that I think she's getting her just desserts? Well, guess what... ...you're right! Kee hee hee! Kee kee kee kee!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Um... Does this mean you admit to wishing the defendant harm?
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Well, the bat is out of the bag now! Kee hee hee! That mistake of mine was a work of art! Thanks to my goof, poor little Trucy had to do all of that hard physical labor.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
When you say "hard physical labor," what are you referring to?
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Because of Mr. Hat's new position, Trucy had to move both of those huge stage lifts!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
They must've been sooo heavy... What a riot! Kee hee hee!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
(That's strange...) Athena, could you please add that last statement to Bonny's testimony?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
All right. I'll update the Mood Matrix with the new info. ......Hm? Hey, Apollo. Now there's a new inconsistency in the testimony.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yeah. She finally slipped up. So what do I need to do now?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Well, from this point onward, you just do what you do best. Find the contradiction in the testimony and present evidence to refute it!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(All right. I've got you now, Bonny de Famme!)</span>

<p>Apollo:<br />
There's definitely a contradiction in her testimony.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
So just present evidence like you always do. And since we finally found something, I'd say we can call the therapy session a success!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You call Batsy McBatty over there a "success"...?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Apollo:<br />
...That doesn't make sense.
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
What?! So you think I'm crazy now?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
No. That's not the point I was trying to make.
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
But I don't hear you denying it!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Ms. de Famme, allow me to repeat your statement: "<span style="color:#E16935">Thanks to that, she ended up having to move the stage lifts.</span>"
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Kee hee hee! That's right! And I still say that's just what she deser--
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
But how did you know? How did you know Ms. Wright moved the stage lifts?
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
According to her own statement... ...she didn't tell anyone that she had done so.
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
WH-WHAT?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
So how could you possibly have known what she had done, unless... you saw her...? You saw Ms. Wright moving the lifts in the understage passage, didn't you!
</p>
<center><b>NOISE LEVEL</b><br /><b>0%</b><br /><br /><b>BYE BYE</b></center>

You did it, Apollo! Noise levels are at 0%!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
B-But, Mr. Justice! Wouldn't that mean...?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes, Your Honor. Ms. de Famme herself was under the stage where the victim was killed. And I hardly need to tell the court what that means...
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Nnnnngh...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You are one artful liar, Ms. de Famme, and one spectacular suspect!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Keeyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Wh-Why, you shiny red lobster boy! You're saying I killed Mr. Reus?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I'm saying that it's a possibility. What's more... ...I say you had a solid motive to frame my client for the murder as well.

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
My apologies for raining on the defense's merry revelry... ...but you seem to have forgotten one very important point.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oh, really?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
The TV footage. As you can clearly see... ...Ms. de Famme was on the stage the whole time. The entire audience can bear witness to that fact -- including you.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oh, yeah...
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
You have just taken a long and senseless journey, only to return to the starting line. The witness could not have been in the understage passage, which means... ...the only one left who could have killed the victim is the accused!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Guess the party's over.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Nnngh... B-But... ...Ms. de Famme knew something she couldn't have known unless she was under the stage! How do you explain that, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It's quite simple: The accused must have told Ms. de Famme about it, but then forgot.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Hrrrmm...
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Ha! Open those useless eyes of yours and take a good look at the footage!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Hmm... If Ms. de Famme really WAS in the understage passage... ...it would mean she was onstage and understage at the same time.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You mean, she was in two places at once? ...........That does seem to be the only explanation that makes any sense...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
It may be an "explanation," but I'm not so sure about the "makes sense" part.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Then we'll just have to MAKE it make sense! Your Honor, the witness was both onstage and understage at the same time. That is the defense's assertion!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........Hmm... I've heard some illogical things come out of you before, but this is absurd.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I'm sure you'll change your tune once you hear my reasoning, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
My gut tells me you're bluffing but I'll bite. Very well, Mr. Justice. <span style="color:green">How do you explain how the witness was in two places at once?</span>

No, wait! Please listen to my argument!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to at least give it a listen.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
As was argued earlier... ...Ms. de Famme is shown in the footage the whole time. But, at the same time, she was also watching Ms. Wright in the understage passage. The only possible explanation is that there are two Bonnys.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... That almost sounds like it makes sense...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What do you think, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
............This humble servant of the Holy Mother is of the opinion... ...that we should lose no time in replacing the defense's many lost screws.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
But, Apollo, it goes against reality itself to say that one person is actually two.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
But we don't have to be bound by reality -- after all, we're talking about magic here.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
So, if the Bonny de Famme in the footage is the real Bonny... ...then the Bonny here on the witness stand, the one who must've been understage... This Bonny de Famme... ...is our "<span style="color:#E16935">second Bonny</span>."
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Keeeeeee!

She is?

</p><p>Betty:<br />
......Ladies and gentlemen of the court, it's time for a wondrous magic show! Gasp in amazement as this lagomorph-ing illusionist performs her teleportation magic! Watch closely! It's showtime!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
What an amazing trick! The witness has suddenly split into two people!
</p><p>Betty:<br />
It's not a trick! No gimmick to it, either!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
We're simply... twins!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
WHAAAAAT?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Twins?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
So that's how the teleportation trick works...
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Ever since our debut, I've had to hide or pretend I'm Bonny. All cute and sweet and goody-goody... I can't tell you how stressful it's been! But I don't have to hide anymore!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
That's right! Our days of sneaking around are finally over!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Their cover is blown, but they actually seem pretty happy about it...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
So which one of you is the nice Bonny de Famme we met in the dressing room?
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
That would be me...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
And the sharp-tongued Bonny we saw with the Ratings Rajah understage was...?
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Hey! Who are you calling "sharp-tongued"?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
It's all starting to make sense now...
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Fingerprinting Results updated in the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, Mr. Justice, this changes the facts of the case rather dramatically, doesn't it?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
It certainly does. During the show, it was <span style="color:#E16935">Bonny</span> who was onstage the whole time. So Bonny couldn't have committed the crime. But <span style="color:#E16935">Betty</span>, on the other hand, who was understage, DID have the opportunity.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Ngh...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
W-Well! So we now have two suspects!

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Betty, you must've been in the understage passage during the show. Otherwise, you wouldn't have known about the stage lifts being moved. So what exactly were you doing down there?
</p><p>Betty:<br />
...Fine! I'll testify! Anything to get you off my back!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, Betty de Famme is ready to testify. What do you say?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
............Betty, you lied to this humble servant of the Holy Mother.
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Hey, what else could I do? I couldn't blow our cover and ruin our magic act. Kee hee hee! Besides, am I gonna go to your twilight hell or whatever for being a liar?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...You will indeed. However, it won't be after your death. Rather... ...I shall give you a taste of your punishment on this mortal coil -- in <span style="color:#E16935">interrogation hell</span>.

<p>Betty:<br />
It's true. I had business in the understage passage because of the upcoming trick.
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
It was the fire trick, right? The one Mr. Reus was supposed to do?
</p><p>Betty:<br />
That's right. It's a very dangerous trick, so I had to make sure we were prepared for it.
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
I-It was in the script... and I really wanted to see it... but I couldn't because of the accident.
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Shut up! You're gonna give it away! ...Anyway, I was real busy.
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Yeah... Way too busy to have the chance to kill Mr. Reus...

<p>Apollo:<br />

So you believe the witness killed a man, simply due to her dislike of Trucy Wright? As a motive, is that not improbable at best?

But what if her hatred caused her to bear a strong sense of malice against my client?
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Look, Trucy just made me mad, that's all. I mean, even though she's younger than me, she's got so much skill and popularity! And she's cute, besides! Grr! She makes me so mad, I wish she would drop dead!

No. During rehearsal, he said he didn't feel well, so he couldn't breathe any fire for me.

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I'm beginning to see... ...the karmic threads that make up the intricate tapestry that is this case. Allow me to summarize your assertions, defense. First, that the victim was killed in the understage passage. And second, that the witness and the accused are the only two who could have done it.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Exactly. What's more, Betty knew that the body would be found... ...and that the magic show would then be called off. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that Betty killed the victim understage. 
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
But what if Betty knew that the show would be called off for <span style="color:#E16935">some other reason</span>?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Like what?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
............In the course of my investigation... ...I found it strange that the dragon set piece fell when it did. That, in conjunction with the body tumbling from the coffin in such a dramatic fashion... ...all seemed too perfect for mere happenstance. It was as though the entire chain of events had been planned out in advance.
</p><p>Betty:<br />
K-Kee!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Ouch!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Planned out?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
After deciding to take this case... ...I scrupulously studied everything I could about the mass media in this country. I read the newspaper, old news reports -- I even browsed tabloid magazines.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
How very industrious of you! I'm impressed.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
During this process, I learned about a strange practice favored by the TV world. A practice called the "<span style="color:#E16935">hidden camera prank</span>." 
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Betty and Bonny, you knew about this, did you not? About the dead body appearing, the set piece falling, the show being suspended... You two were informed of this plan... ...by Take-2 TV in advance, correct?
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I-Is that true...?
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Betty! Please, let's tell them now! I can't hold it in anymore!
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Nnnnnnnnnnnggggrrrrrrrrrrrr! D-Dang it! F-Fine, you got us! Everything the prosecutor said is true! The TV station paid us to cooperate with them on this plan! It was all a <span style="color:#E16935">prank</span> -- a big setup planned out in advance! Mr. Reus showing up dead in the coffin... The set piece falling down... It was all... completely scripted!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I-It was all... ...A PRANK?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Bonny! Is this really true?!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Yes. Mr. Reus was supposed to <span style="color:#E16935">pretend to be dead</span>. That's how it was supposed to go.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
So he was in on it, too?
</p><p>Betty:<br />
That's right. He was supposed to show up "dead" in the coffin... ...and then the set piece would fall down. Trucy would be shocked and start to panic.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(What the heck kind of prank is that?!)</span>
</p><p>Betty:<br />
But we never thought... ...he'd actually wind up dead...
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Yeah... That was the only thing that was <span style="color:#E16935">different from the script</span>. Poor Mr. Reus...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I'm so completely lost right now...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, Betty and Bonny, it certainly sounds like you have some explaining to do!
</p><p>Betty:<br />
All right, all right. I guess desperate times call for desperate measures! Kee hee hee! Just this once, we'll share how it was done with you. So listen carefully! You'll never hear this kind of thing anywhere else! After our teleportation trick, I went down understage.
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
When Mr. Reus's body appeared from the coffin on stage... ...it was time for Betty to do her job in the understage passage.
</p><p>Betty:<br />
That's right. I used the remote control for the winch connected to the dragon set piece... ...and made it fall down.
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
And just before the dragon fell... ...I called Trucy to the backstage, so she wouldn't get hurt.
</p><p>Betty:<br />
After that, the plan was for Mr. Reus to come back to life in front of a panicked Trucy. He was supposed to laugh and fly up and away. That was how it was scripted, anyway. But for some reason, he really DID turn up dead, so he kinda just stayed on the ground.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
............ <span style="color:#0070C0">(Wh-What kind of sick joke is that...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It sounds like a terribly mean-spirited prank to me. The poor defendant was trying to do her magic show!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
I guess so... I'm sorry, Trucy.
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Hmph! Whatever. It was all the Ratings Rajah's idea anyway.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Yeah... It sounds like just the kind of thing a guy like him would come up with.
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Um... This is the prank plan script we got from the Ratings Rajah.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Prank Plan Script added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Dang it! You made us break our contract! Now we won't get paid!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... But where does this all leave us? Who killed the victim... and when?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...Yes, exactly. Those are the key questions If Mr. Reus was only pretending to be dead in the coffin as a part of the prank... ...then when he was understage... ...there would still be life within him. And if that is the case... ...then Betty, who was also understage, may be excluded from our list of suspects.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Ah... AAAAAH!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Witness, was the victim alive up until he entered the coffin?
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Oh, well. Now that we've spilled the beans, we might as well show you this video.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Mr. Reus:<br />
<span style="color:green">Greetings, viewers! It is I, The Great Mr. Reus! We are currently in the middle of Trucy's escape trick. Having snuck through the understage passage undetected, I am now hiding <span style="color:#E16935">backstage</span>... ...preparing to play a little <span style="color:#E16935">prank</span> on Trucy! I'm about to hide in the coffin, which Trucy will stab with her rubber sword. And when the coffin opens -- ho ho! I will be in it, acting as though I've met my maker! Can you imagine the look on Trucy's face then! Ho ho, I can hardly WAIT!</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Apollo:<br />
He's "about to" hide in the coffin...?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...It would seem the threads of karmic destiny... ...have led us to the truth.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
............
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
The victim passed through the understage, where Betty de Famme was... ...and came up into the <span style="color:#E16935">backstage</span> area. We know this because Mr. Reus appeared to be backstage when he shot the video we saw.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...It appears that way, yes.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
And defense, you proposed the following, did you not? "What if the victim was killed under the stage before being put into the coffin?" But then, what about this video? This footage was taken just before Mr. Reus entered the coffin.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Nnngh...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh! So does that mean...?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Yes, it is horrible, but true. The tragedy did indeed play out right there on the stage... ...when into the coffin where Mr. Reus was hiding... ...Trucy Wright thrust her blade!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Arngh... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Kee hee hee! Seeee? Told you so!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So are you saying the incident was a tragic accident that happened during a prank?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It would be an accident... if the accused had no knowledge of the prank beforehand. So let us ask the accused herself: Ms. Wright, did you have prior knowledge of the prank?
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
What?! I... I...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Tell him, Trucy! You didn't know anything about it, right?!
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
Of course I didn't... I didn't know a single thing about it!

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Still think you can play innocent, do you? In that case... ...you leave me little choice but to present this piece of evidence.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It looks like... some sort of note?
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Aaaaaaaaaaaagh! Th-That's...!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I found this note in the dressing room after the incident. At the time, I did not understand what it meant, but all is clear to me now.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What's this? 
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Let's see. "<span style="color:#E16935">Get the video camera after Mr. Reus comes tumbling out.</span>"...?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It is a note signed by the accused... ...instructing Bonny to collect Mr. Reus's video camera from him, it seems.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
......I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense...
</p><p>Betty:<br />
I found it in the dressing room before the show. When I saw it, I realized that Trucy knew about the prank.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
It does bear her signature... I'll give you that much... 
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Trucy's Note added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So the defendant had prior knowledge of the prank?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It would appear so, yes. When she learned about the plan to trick her, she decided to use it to her own advantage. So she thrust the steel sword into the coffin where the victim stood chuckling to himself... Is that not what happened, Ms. Wright?
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
O-Of course not! And I didn't write or sign that note!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Ah, but the handwriting matches yours. All of the evidence and testimony points to you being the culprit.
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
B-But... I didn't do it! It wasn't me!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Then explain the existence of this note! You can do that, can you not?
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
I...I can't explain it. I didn't write it, so I don't understand... I didn't kill Mr. Reus! You have to believe me! 
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />

<span style="color:#0070C0">(...I won't give up. And I refuse to let either of them down... Mr. Wright, who's counting on me... And Trucy, who's put all of her faith in me...!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......Mr. Justice, the fact that you have raised an objection... ...means that you have evidence with which to refute the prosecution's claims, correct?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes, of course, Your Honor!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Do we really have anything, Apollo...?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
......Actually, we do! There's one piece of evidence we can present here! 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well, Mr. Justice. You may proceed. 
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
As we saw in the show footage... ...there's no question that the defendant thrust a sword into the coffin. The defense doesn't dispute this point. But let us not forget that this was a magic show, filled with tricks and illusions. We can't take everything we see at face value.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... So you're saying some sleight of hand was somehow involved?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes. The defense contends that the sword the defendant used was not the cause of death. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Now what was it Trucy told me she did just before she thrust the sword into the coffin?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......Very well. Let us see your evidence, then, Mr. Justice. But remember: you interrupted my verdict to make this claim. You will be severely penalized if I find you are bluffing.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Ngrk...! Th-That's fine, Your Honor! <span style="color:green">This shows that it's possible that the sword Ms. Wright used was not the cause of death!</span>

Owie... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess I can't always have it my way... There's only one piece of evidence that makes sense here... Now, what was it that Trucy said she did... ...just before she thrust the sword into the coffin?)</span>

<p>Judge:<br />
What's this? A sword from the show?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That's right, Your Honor. This rubber sword was in the sword stand understage. Ms. Wright was supposed to swap the real sword for a <span style="color:#E16935">rubber sword</span>. And she told us on record that she remembers very clearly that she did.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I see. So the sword the defendant thrust into the coffin was a rubber sword, was it? But then why was a <span style="color:#E16935">steel sword</span> found lying on the stage?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...Somebody must have put the steel sword there by swapping it with the rubber one. Just after the incident occurred, the dragon set piece fell, and the theater was evacuated. The real culprit must have used the resulting chaos... ...to swap the rubber sword for the steel one!

Do you not know when to give up, stink bug?! That is NOT possible! <span style="color:#E16935">Blood</span> was found in the coffin hole that the sword was thrust into!

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Finding the answer to that question... is precisely why we need to continue this trial!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Let me express my opinion. By all accounts, it is certainly reasonable to suspect the defendant based on the evidence. But as to the question of whether the sword the defendant used was rubber or steel... ...I believe further discussion is warranted. I suggest we hear from the defendant herself on this issue.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
......Very well, Your Honor.

Tell me about it. We barely made it through by the skin of my teeth.

I can't say I'm crazy about that Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, either... You know, with the way he says "let it go, and move on" as if it's nothing.

Huh? Filming? What are you talking about?I don't even have a camera on me.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(It just disappeared, right before our very eyes...)</span>

Heh heh. I'll be enjoying the rest of The Trucy Show from the gallery. I put out a call for Trucy's fans to come and support her earlier, by the way. Bet I'll get some great footage outta them! This is gonna be good! Hang loose, baby!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
He called in some of Trucy's fans? <span style="color:#0070C0">(But for what purpose...?)</span>
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
...Apollo? That thing Mr. Retinz just did... that was some high-level sleight of hand.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Huh? Why would he know how to do something like that?
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
I don't know, but he definitely has some serious magic skills.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />

I usually hide the steel sword backstage when I switch them during the show.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So when you thrust the rubber sword into the coffin... ...the steel sword wasn't even onstage, but behind the curtain?
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
Exactly. So, you see, there IS a trick and a gimmick to it after all. And as for where the steel sword went when I performed the trick just now... It's a secret! Wouldn't want to spoil the magic for you, now would I!

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
So, you switched swords when you spun around just now?
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
That's right. It's the same way I do the trick in the actual magic show, too. But I'm also doing a lot of extra things that I don't do during the show right now, though.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
The key point is the sword switching... If only we could prove she did it during the actual show, too...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Right. Prove that she switched them during the show... Hmm...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
What's the matter, Apollo? You look troubled.

Oh, it's nothing... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Uh-oh. This is quite the pickle... How should I go about handling this...?)</span>

Ms. Wright, please continue with your trick.

! Wh-What is it, Apollo?

There seems to be a discrepancy between the way you performed the trick for us just now... ...and the way it appears in the show footage.
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
What? But that can't be! I performed it exactly the same way both times!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Then what's going on here?)</span> Ms. Wright, I have the show footage right here... ...and the part where you twirl your cape around is missing from it.

S-So... ...it really is the exact moment you switch the swords?

! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I-I knew it...)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Well, I certainly never expected the defense to expose the accused's lie for me.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mr. Justice, does this mean that you are arguing... ...that the defendant did NOT swap the swords during the actual magic show...?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
......N-No, Your Honor. That wasn't my intention. I-I mean...
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
I DID swap them! I know I did! I'm absolutely sure of it!

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Human memory is unreliable at best, but, in this case... ...I am afraid that it is the witness herself who cannot be trusted. We can see the footage for ourselves. The claims of this witness are false.
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
B-But...!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Now that it has been proven that the accused did not swap swords... ...it means that the use of the steel sword to pierce the coffin was wholly intentional.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Gurk!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
And by the way, was it not you, Mr. Justice, who argued... ...that Mr. Reus's death was not an accident, but murder? I assume you have no objections to that still? It was, after all, our own assertion.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
The defense, um...

The defense has an objection... to you, Mr. Apollo Justice! I demand you withdraw the discrepancy you pointed out, now!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
B-But there IS a discrepancy, and it MUST mean something! I'm sure of it!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Would the defense team kindly save their spat until after court is adjourned? ...Now, after all of this debate, it seems we've come back around to the original argument. The defendant knew about the prank plan that would place the victim inside the coffin. What's more, the defendant did not perform the sword-switching trick onstage.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Through her actions, I'm afraid I have come to see the true intentions of the accused. <span style="color:#E16935">Her murderous intentions</span>.

............No. I won't be quiet.
</p><p>Betty:<br />
What's the matter with you? Didn't you hear me?!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
............T-Trucy said something to me once.
</p><p>Betty:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
She said, "No matter how scared you get... no matter how mean people are to you... ...you can't give in or give up! That's what being a professional magician is all about!" Isn't that right, Trucy?
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
! Th-That's right, Bonny!
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
I've always been afraid to stand up to Betty -- afraid to defy her -- so I did what she said... But when I saw Trucy today, she gave me strength.

<p>Bonny:<br />
Seeing her courage, the way she kept smiling despite everything.... She's just incredible. I'm scared, but, for once... ...I'm going to be brave!

Grrr! What have you done to my sister, Trucy Wright?! You've practically brainwashed her!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
It's the power of Trucy's conviction -- that's what it is! It's touched Bonny's heart!

Yeah. Trucy really is one magical girl. Bonny, is the topic of your testimony related to that thing that was bothering you? The thing you tried to tell us about in the lobby during the recess?
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
Yes. Ever since I saw the show footage, something's been nagging at me. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but something is off. I feel like something about it is different from what I saw on the stage.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What do you mean by that, Bonny?

I wonder if what was shown on TV is really the same as what happened onstage.

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
But Bonny's testimony deserves our attention! We have to examine the show footage!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... But what can we check it against? Do you have some other footage of the show?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
W-Well...
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
I have some show footage.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You do?
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
One of the TV station's cameramen said he was a fan of mine. He kept his camera on me throughout the entire show. And then, afterwards... he gave me the footage he shot as a present.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
H-He did...?
</p><p>Bonny:<br />
To tell you the truth, I thought it was kind of creepy, so I was going to get rid of it...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />

P-Please submit that footage to the court!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, then. Let's take a look at this new footage.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Apollo:<br />
W-Wow...Okay, then...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
He really did keep his camera on Bonny the whole time, didn't he!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I think this cameraman needs to keep his personal feelings out of his work.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Well, defense? Do you still believe this new show footage is worth inspecting?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
O-Of course I do...!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Okay, so how are we going to go about this?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Let's try comparing the two. We just might find an <span style="color:#E16935">inconsistency</span> between them.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
An inconsistency, huh?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes. The two pieces of footage are of the same scene, so they should match up. But Bonny felt there was something off about the original footage. So if we can pick out <span style="color:#E16935">what's different between the two</span>...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
...We'll know what Bonny found strange.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Exactly. Plus, we may figure out why the original doesn't show the sword-switching trick. Your Honor, the defense would like to compare these two pieces of show footage!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. I will allow it.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
What a waste of time...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Apollo, do you know how to compare the two pieces of footage?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
No, I've never done it before...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I'll give you a little lesson, then! Use the buttons on the bottom screen to operate the playback. When you want to speed through, touch the <span style="color:#E16935">"Fast Forward" button</span> (A). And if you want to go back, touch the <span style="color:#E16935">"Rewind" button</span> (Y). If you want to halt the playback, you can touch the <span style="color:#E16935">"Pause" button</span> (B). Oh, and, by the way, if you fast-forward or rewind when the playback is paused... ...you can do a slow, frame-by-frame playback.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Okay. And so how do I switch between the two videos?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Just touch the <span style="color:#E16935">"Switch Camera" button</span> (L) at the top left. Now, if you find a difference between the two pieces of footage... ...put the cursor over what's different and "<span style="color:#E16935">Presen</span>t" (X) it to the court.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Thanks, Athena. You really know your stuff.

</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Could that not simply be because Bonny was not paying attention? Besides, her reaction is not shown in the video that was shot from the front. You can hardly call it a proper discrepancy if you cannot even compare the two shots.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Ugh... I-I guess you're right... <span style="color:#0070C0">(But still... ...there's definitely something different between the two -- I can just tell. Is there something else? Something that's shown in one of the videos... ...but not in the other?)</span>

Ms. Wright, what can you tell us about these playing cards?

WHAT?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mr. Justice! Does this mean...?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes, it means that the sword-switching trick... ...was cut from the TV show footage.

So the footage was edited?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes, with malicious intent.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />

</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Now hold up, Your Honor! This is all just a big misunderstanding -- believe you me! Give a guy a chance to defend himself before you start pointing fingers!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And who might you be?
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Right, right! Sorry about that -- got ahead of myself there. Here is my business card. Chaaarmed to make your acquaintance, Your Hooonor!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh! Well! How very polite of you.
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
It's looovely to meet you, too, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Please, take my caaard!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
A business card...? Ah, yes. I read about this custom among businessmen in this country. I have even familiarized myself with the various replies. "How do you do, good sir?" or, "What's crack-a-lackin', homie?" for example.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
O-ho! You're from Take-2 TV, are you, witness? Come to think of it, I believe I've seen you on television before.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Yes. Roger Retinz -- otherwise known as the "Ratings Rajah." He is a TV producer, and appears on many of his own shows as of late. He is best known for his catchphrase, "Hang loose, baby!"
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, my! So YOU'RE the Ratings Rajah!
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Hang loose, Judgey baby! Nice courtroom you got here!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I never thought I'd get to meet you in person! But Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, how do you know so much about him?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
In preparation for the case, I watched all of his shows. I found "The Ratings Rajah Goes to Burger Barn" of particular interest. It inspired me to visit that restaurant straight away to learn more about the local cuisine.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What?! YOU went to Burger Barn?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Who would've thought...?)</span>
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
You must've really wanted to try it, huh, buddy. 'Cause that line -- whew.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Compared to my ascetic training, an hour's wait is nothing. I recommend the Southwestern burger with Jalapeno Jack cheese, by the way.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I'm having a really hard time picturing him in line for burgers...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ahem! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's unexpected enthusiasm for food aside... ...Mr. Retinz, what is this "misunderstanding" you mentioned?
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Well, for starters, it's true that the footage was edited. You'll get your hands on this anyway, so I might as well show you the unedited footage. It's a pretty long video, o I'll just show you the part with the playing cards. You can see the cards when Trucy spins around, so keep your eyes peeled.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Retinz:<br />
Did you see the part that was cut where Trucy switched the swords? She spins around and the playing cards go flying -- everything's like it's supposed to be.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Then it seems the defendant really did swap swords during the trick.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Which means the sword Ms. Wright thrust into the coffin was the rubber one. In other words, Ms. Wright couldn't have killed Mr. Reus!
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20220419202855" class="image"><img alt="SoJ Hold it!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="183" data-image-name="SoJ Hold it!.png" data-image-key="SoJ_Hold_it%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/4/48/SoJ_Hold_it%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20220419202855" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Yeah, see... that's the first misunderstanding right there.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Well, Trucy definitely did swap swords, as you saw. So, yeah, maybe she didn't kill Mr. Reus when she stabbed the coffin. But that just means he was killed AFTER he showed up pretending to be a corpse.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
So you're saying that up until that point, everything was going according to the script? If that's true, then when and how exactly do you think he was killed?
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
It was after the dragon set piece came crashing down. I say Trucy murdered Mr. Reus when she was hidden from view behind the set piece. She could've easily done it behind that huge dragon, and nobody'd be the wiser.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Hmm... I see. Indeed, there is a ring of truth to your assertion.
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
You bet! Plus, there's a <span style="color:#E16935">suspicious-looking shadow</span> in the footage, too! It's toward the end of the footage, just before the dragon hits the stage. It might be easier to just see it for yourselves.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Retinz:<br />
It's only for a split second, so it's hard to catch, but... look here. This suspicious shadow must be Trucy. She's using the steel sword she hid behind the curtain during the trick to kill the victim.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Now that you mention it, I suppose it does look that way...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />

</p><p>Retinz:<br />
You see? There's your second misunderstanding right there. Your Honor, would you mind if I testified about it? I've seen people testify on TV, and I've always wanted to give it a shot.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That would be fine with me. Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
...This is quite unexpected. It threatens to disrupt the karmic course of this case.
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Hey, lighten up, pretty boy! You're gonna LIKE what I've got to say! Promise!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
............Very well. However... ...if you do anything to impede the last rites for the victim... I will have you removed.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
All right. With Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's permission... ...please give us your testimony, Mr. Retinz.

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Are you saying you thought there were boring scenes in Ms. Wright's magic show?
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
You gotta ask? That script and presentation deserve a place on the cutting room floor. Broadcasting that mess as-is would've been a complete disaster. That's why I had to edit the footage. It's just what a TV man does!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What didn't you like about the show, exactly?
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
The whole thing -- it was a major snoozefest. Maybe common folk like you don't get it... ...but a show's only as good as how loud, flashy, and trashy it is.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It was plenty loud and flashy on its own. All you did was add the trash.)</span>
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
I suppose each industry has its own way of doing things. Just as we in the legal profession focus exclusively on evidence and testimony...
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Exactly. Whether it's show biz or the legal biz, we do what we gotta do to get the job done. Anyway, editing footage is just a matter of course in the TV industry.

Words such as those can be interpreted in many different ways. For example, though I bear the defense no ill will... ..I would not hesitate to say that he is a good-for-nothing lout of a lawyer.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You bear me no ill will...? Could've fooled me.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
And yet, it is the truth. I am only strict on you as it seems you have strayed from the path.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If you have any objections, Mr. Justice, please make your case with evidence in the future. Mr. Retinz, please continue your testimony.

</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Huh? What's that you got there?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
This is the contract you had Ms. Wright sign just before the magic show. This contract between the first party, Take-2 TV, and the second party, Ms. Wright, reads: "If, through the fault of the second party, the show must be canceled in part or in full... ...the second party will pay three million dollars as compensation to the first party."
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Th-Three million dollars?! That's a completely unreasonable sum.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I couldn't agree more. And of course Ms. Wright doesn't have that kind of money. Nevertheless, Roger Retinz had her sign this unreasonable contract anyway. Or, more accurately, he conned her into signing it.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Conned her? How did he do that?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
There's a trick to the clipboard that was used by Ms. Wright to sign her contract. It houses carbon paper that can secretly copy her signature onto other documents.
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Oh, c'mon, now! That's quite a nasty accusation you're slinging my way. For starters, you don't have any proof I had anything to do with that carbon paper stuff. Just because Trucy and her agency can't pay up, that doesn't mean I conned her!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... But three million dollars... That's totally out of reach for the average person. In any case, this is important new information. Please add it to your testimony, Mr. Retinz.

And who exactly are you naming, Mr. Justice?

Thirteen years ago, The Great Mr. Reus belonged to Troupe Gramarye But then, the troupe ousted him, and Mr. Reus vowed to get revenge on them someday. And what better way to accomplish that than through the ruination of their sole heir?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But Mr. Reus is the victim, Mr. Justice! You've named a dead man as your suspect!

Strange are the karmic threads before me... If the witness is the real Mr. Reus, then who is the victim who perished in the magic show?

He was but a fan. I met him on one of my programs several years ago. He said he had become a magician out of admiration for The Great Mr. Reus. In confidence, I told him my true identity, and let him take on my mantle.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And when did this man take over for you?
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
About two years ago. I taught him my tricks, and even acted as his producer. And so, a mere amateur became a popular magician overnight... ...courtesy of my magic, on the stage we call television. Hope you enjoyed the show!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You really had us all fooled.

Mr. Retinz... or, should I say, Mr. Reus! In your hatred of Troupe Gramarye, you killed the victim, Mr. Mistree... ...and then set up Ms. Wright to take the fall, didn't you? You did it all just to tarnish the Gramarye name!
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Ho ho ho. I have no idea what you're talking about, lad. I set up the prank, that much is true. But it was simply a harmless joke on Trucy, I assure you.

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Enough with the ambiguity. Why don't you make your point already?
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
My alibi is as pristine as ever. Wouldn't you agree, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
......Yes, I suppose that is correct. The witness does have a solid alibi.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
What?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Recall, defense, that at the time of the magic show, Mr. Retinz was at Take-2 TV. A fact that many people can easily attest to.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Gah! <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's right... I forgot all about that!)</span>
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Ho ho ho. So what do you think, Your Honor? Would you like me to testify on the matter?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, I think you'd better. Please tell the court more about your alibi.
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Very well, then -- on with the show! Are you watching, Magnifi Gramarye?! The time has finally come for my magic to snuff out your precious pedigree! The Gramarye line will be no more!

I was at the TV station at the time of the Penrose performance.<br />
I was busy working on another TV program. I could spare no time for the magic show.<br />
Do ask my staff if you doubt my claim.<br />
And there it is: a simple and perfect alibi. No tricks. No gimmicks. Just the truth!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Retinz:<br />
Do you understand now, perhaps? I did not grace the theater with my presence until <span style="color:#E16935">after the incident</span>. So how could I have committed the murder?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm... His staff did say he was there at the station... ...so it sure does sound like a rock-solid alibi...)</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
But that can't be right. If Mr. Retinz is the killer, he'd had to have been at the theater.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
There's gotta be a hole somewhere in his story...
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Heh heh heh. I assure you there are no holes on Mr. Reus's stage. No tricks, no gimmicks. True magic doesn't need trapdoors to escape through! Do enjoy my show to the fullest... ...and my real alibi!

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
But you did come to the theater eventually, isn't that right?
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Indeed. Anxious to see how the show was progressing, I made my way to the theater. Let's see... My journey took about ten minutes by car.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Could he actually have been at the theater during those ten minutes, killing the victim?)</span>
</p><p>Retinz:<br />

</p><p>Apollo:<br />
How in the--!
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
But no, I took a taxi. The driver can attest to that. Feel free to call the taxi company, if my word does not satisfy you. The driver is a big fan of the Ratings Rajah. I even gave him my card.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He gave the driver his card? That was very clever of him...)</span>
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
You might as well give it up, lad. Questioning real magic is a fool's errand. Besides, you know very well what I was doing at the time of the incident.

What was this other TV show you were working on?
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
My own special project, you see. I... Ah, one moment. Perhaps this is more appropriate... It's a Ratings Rajah special production! Yeah! Hang loose, baby! It's called "Desperation Regeneration!"
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He switched personas just to say that?)</span> What's the show about?
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Washed-up, has-been singers and comedians get together and play musical chairs. The winner of the game is given a second chance at their career. A priceless prize for chumps who washed up too early in life. Sounds great, right?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Might I suggest you appear on that show, Mr. Justice? As the ex-lawyer who used to make ridiculous bluffs in court, and faded sadly into obscurity.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />

</p><p>Retinz:<br />
......What are you going on about, lad?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Have you got something, Apollo?

I just remembered something Trucy said about... ...misdirection. What a magician says is there really isn't, and what they say isn't there actually is!

What have we been made to believe <span style="color:#E16935">was there</span> when it actually wasn't? What have we taken to be the "absolute facts" of this case...? If I reevaluate the validity of all of these things... then just maybe...!)</span> ......Athena... There's something uncanny about this case.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Okay, what is it?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Retinz's <span style="color:#E16935">alibi</span>. It's TOO perfect.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
...That's true. It's like it's impossible to break, no matter how hard we try.

We're not making any headway here because we've been so focused on <span style="color:#E16935">breaking his alibi</span>.

Not in the slightest.

<p>Apollo:<br />
Doesn't this shadow resemble the suspicious shadowy figure?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Now that you mention it, it does, doesn't it?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Ms. Wright, could you identify this shadow for the court?
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
Let's see... I believe that's <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Hat's shadow</span>. It's from when he's being pulled up from the stage to the catwalk overhead by wire.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Then, could this shadow that's shown later in the footage be Mr. Hat, too?
</p><p>Trucy:<br />
No... that's not possible. After Mr. Hat was pulled up to the catwalk, he stayed up there.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
In other words, this second shadow is from <span style="color:#E16935">some other figure</span> being pulled up.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Some other figure? I'm afraid you'll need to be more specific than that, Mr. Justice.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />

</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Apollo:<br />
If we consider what was happening on the stage at the time, there is only one answer: The shadow belonged to the fake Mr. Reus. In other words, Mr. Manov Mistree.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The victim...?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Please take a look at the prank plan script. Mr. Mistree was to pretend to be dead, and then fly up into the air after that. Isn't that right, Mr. Retinz?
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Indeed. And what of it?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I contend that that's exactly what happened. The victim was wearing a <span style="color:#E16935">stunt harness</span> around his waist. It was most likely attached to a stunt wire so that he could be pulled up into the air.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So you're suggesting that, after pretending to be dead in the coffin... ...the victim flew up into the air, just as the prank script says?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Exactly. We just couldn't see him go flying up because the dragon was blocking our view. And that last trick, ladies and gentlemen... ...is the true pièce de résistance of the culprit's murderous magic show!
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
............Hrrrngh!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Don't tell me... you've got it all figured out?! 
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...Yes, I think so. If we can just look beyond Mr. Retinz's <span style="color:#E16935">last bit of misdirection</span>... ...we should finally be able to see the real truth. <span style="color:#0070C0">(The victim must've been pulled up to the catwalk, just like Mr. Hat... ...and hit the cushioning up there with considerable force. I just have to figure out what else happened up there at that time!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Are you ready to elaborate, Mr. Justice?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes, Your Honor. I'm ready.

In that case, please answer me this: <span style="color:green">Why did the culprit make the victim fly up into the air like that?</span>

<p>Apollo:<br />
Just why DID the culprit have the victim fly up after he appeared in the coffin? And how DID the victim actually die... ...when he was only pretending to be dead in the coffin? If we can figure out how these two questions relate, the answers should become clear.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
C-Could it be...?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Mr. Mistree must've thought he was still just part of a prank when he appeared onstage. He probably didn't suspect a thing as he was being pulled into the air... ...after Ms. Wright was called backstage, and just as the set piece fell. But the culprit had already planted the real <span style="color:#E16935">murder weapon</span> in a cushion in the catwalk. It was probably... a knife or blade of some sort.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
What? You mean...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yes, it really was a magical murder. Just as the prank script said, Mr. Mistree was whisked up into the air... ...and straight into <span style="color:#E16935">a blade there in the catwalk</span>. In other words, <span style="color:#E16935">this murder was committed remotely</span> through the use of a magic trick!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
R-R-Remotely?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Using this method, it wouldn't matter WHERE Mr. Retinz was at the time of death!
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
......Ngh... Ngaaaaaaagh!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
B-But how exactly does it work, Mr. Justice?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Just before the murder occurred... ...the dragon set piece was up in the catwalk. It and Mr. Manov Mistree... were connected to each other by a wire at the time. By carrying out the prank plan, Betty made the dragon set piece fall... ...which caused Mr. Mistree to rocket straight up... ...and into the blade in the cushion! The cushion was high up enough to be hidden from the audience's view. That's why nobody saw the blade.
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Nnnnnnnnngh...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Oh...! Then that big gash in Mr. Hat's cape...!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
The blade must have been set up overhead sometime before the magic show. Mr. Hat must've been slashed by it, too, when he was pulled up to the cushion.
</p><p>Betty:<br />

</p><p>Betty:<br />
I-I can't believe it... I had no idea... I was told that Trucy would freak out if I made the set piece fall... That's the only reason I did it!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You were used, Betty -- Roger Retinz used you.
</p><p>Betty:<br />
I... I thought he was my little puppet to boss around, but it was the other way around...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
After the incident occurred, Mr. Retinz arrived at the theater. He got the murder weapon and swapped the rubber sword with the bloodied steel one. That's also when he lowered the victim's body down to the stage.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
...But how did he have time to do all that?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
When the set piece fell, the audience was evacuated from the building. He was able to do all those things after the fact because there was no one around to see.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A horrific murder camouflaged by a spectacular magic show? That sounds like the kind of murder only a magician could pull off.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
As long as the show proceeded as it was scripted, Mr. Mistree was doomed to die. That's why, YOU, Mr. Retinz, the victim -- all the way from the TV station! This prank plan -- or should I say, <span style="color:#E16935">murder plan</span> -- proves your murderous intent!

No blade of any kind was found in the catwalk.... ...which means you have <span style="color:#E16935">no evidence</span> to support your theory.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
B-But Mr. Retinz retrieved it after the fact...!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Which still leaves you with no way to prove your wildly fantastic "remote murder" theory.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
B-But...!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
Without proof, does it not make more sense to believe... ...that the murder was committed there on the stage? That's where the <span style="color:#E16935">blood-stained sword</span> was found, after all.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... That is a very good point.
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
As the only person who could have committed the crime there on that stage... ...Trucy Wright remains the prime suspect!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
............Ngh... NNNNGGGGHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
It would appear that what you call "truth" is little more than a cheap parlor trick. In the end, you have done nothing to prove the accused's innocence. It is time at last to let it go... and move on!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
...Gnrk!

............H-Ho ho ho ho ho. Are you seeing this, Magnifi Gramarye? My magic is exacting punishment on your granddaughter! The Gramarye name... is done for!

Apollo! We need to hit them with a decisive piece of evidence here!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I know. That's just what I was thinking!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mr. Justice. Do you or don't you have anything... ...to prove that the witness committed this "remote murder" you proposed?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Of course I do, Your Honor!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
This entire incident was carried out exactly according to the script.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Right. So theoretically, there should be no evidence for us to find or use. Which means our best bet is to see if something unscripted happened. <span style="color:#0070C0">(There's gotta be something Retinz couldn't have foreseen... And once I find it, that's how I'll expose his murderous trick!)</span> Get ready, Mr. Retinz, because I'm about to reveal the secret to your magic. There are no tricks or gimmicks here -- just some good old-fashioned logic!

That's right! The left and right panels of the coffin are interchangeable. The culprit must've switched the two panels to make the bloodstain fit the facts.

<p>Nahyuta:<br />
The fingerprinting results?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What about the fingerprints is "unnatural"?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Let's take a look at the prints the victim left inside the coffin, shall we? If the victim was facing forward in the coffin, his prints should've looked like this. However, what we found was they were <span style="color:#E16935">facing the opposite direction</span>. It's quite unnatural for the prints to be facing this way, wouldn't you agree?
</p><p>Nahyuta:<br />
......Ah!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It IS strange, isn't it? But how did they get this way?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
They got this way because the culprit thought the magic show had gone according to script. The culprit thought Mr. Hat would be on the left side of the coffin... ...and that Ms. Wright would also pop up to the left of the coffin, as per the show's script. He then assumed <span style="color:#E16935">she had thrust the sword into the hole on the left side of the coffin</span>. That's why he put blood <span style="color:#E16935">in the left hole</span> when he was trying to cover up his crime. But some time after leaving the bloodstain, the culprit must've realized his mistake. He found out that, due to Bonny's mistake, Mr. Hat was to the right of the coffin... ...and that despite the script, Ms. Wright had thrust the sword into <span style="color:#E16935">the hole on the right</span>. In short, the hole with the blood in it was on <span style="color:#E16935">the side opposite the one that Trucy used</span>. To make the blood's location fit the facts, he had to tamper with the evidence yet again. So he tried to cover his tracks by <span style="color:#E16935">switching the coffin's left and right panels</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Oh! And that's how the fingerprints in the coffin ended up backwards! Because the culprit switched the two side panels around... ...the prints ended up facing the opposite direction. ......But instead of going to all that trouble with the panels... ...why didn't the culprit just wipe the blood away and redo it on the other side?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I'm afraid that wouldn't have worked, Your Honor. Because of a little something called "luminol testing."
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah! Right. Luminol. I almost forgot... Luminol can detect trace amounts of blood, even if it's been wiped away, right?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
That's right. Wiping the blood away would've only served as proof of his meddling. How about it, Mr. Retinz? I did a pretty good job figuring out your trick, didn't I?
</p><p>Retinz:<br />
Nnnnnnngh...

I believe in you, Trucy. And I believe in your skill as a professional magician. So I'm going to prove your innocence. Don't worry -- you're going to be FINE!

Well, I wasn't able to convince Prosecutor Sahdmadhi what a good person you are. And I had to testify against you, too.

"Acquaintances"? It seemed like something more than that.

Hi, Daddy! I'm okay now!

Okay. Then I'll be sure to save you the best seat in the house, Polly!

You have to pinpoint inconsistencies between Bonny's testimony and her emotions. For example, if she's saying, "It made me so mad"... ...but the Mood Matrix shows that she was feeling "Happy" -- inconsistencies like that.

Okay. I think I've got it.
