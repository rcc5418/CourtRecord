                    &lt;line speaker="Phoenix"&gt;Prosecutor Blackquill! What if I told you that the two astronauts... ...never set foot inside the launch pad area, but instead, went into another place? And what if when the director moved Launch Pad 1 back, it was not from the launch site... ...but from another place. What would you say then?&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Blackquill"&gt;Cut the existential bull or I'll cut you.&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Judge"&gt;Mr. Wright, you will explain yourself at once!&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Phoenix"&gt;&lt;thought&gt;I know I'm right. It was all the other way around from the beginning!&lt;/thought&gt; Very well, Your Honor. Let me explain. Director Cosmos's reason for moving Launch Pad 1 was...&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Phoenix"&gt;Because he wanted to hide Launch Pad 1!&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Judge"&gt;Hmm, well, let's suppose he did move it. Where in the world would he hide it? An enormous launch pad like that... I highly doubt it could truly be hidden.&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Phoenix"&gt;Oh, uh... behind something, maybe...?&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Judge"&gt;Mr. Wright! Are you asking me or telling me?!&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Phoenix"&gt;Urk. &lt;thought&gt;Looks like I messed that up...&lt;/thought&gt; Your Honor! Please let me give it another try!&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Phoenix"&gt;Because he wanted to trap the true killer!&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Blackquill"&gt;............Hmph. Wright-dono, need I remind you there was an explosion? And that the corridor between the launch pad and the lounge was thick with smoke? If the killer had been trapped in there, they would've been found as dead as their victim.&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Phoenix"&gt;I-I guess you're right.&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Judge"&gt;Well, I'm glad you both agree. Now here's a penalty for you, Mr. Wright.&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Phoenix"&gt;&lt;thought&gt;I don't agree with that penalty, though...&lt;/thought&gt; Your Honor! Please give me another chance!&lt;/line&gt;
