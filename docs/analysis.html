                <code> &lt;line speaker="Phoenix"&gt;Prosecutor Blackquill! What if I told you that
                    the two astronauts... ...never set foot inside the launch pad area, but instead,
                    went into another place? And what if when the director moved Launch Pad 1 back,
                    it was not from the launch site... ...but from another place. What would you say
                    then?&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Blackquill"&gt;Cut the existential
                    bull or I'll cut you.&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Judge"&gt;Mr. Wright,
                    you will explain yourself at once!&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line
                    speaker="Phoenix"&gt;&lt;thought&gt;I know I'm right. It was all the other way
                    around from the beginning!&lt;/thought&gt; Very well, Your Honor. Let me
                    explain. Director Cosmos's reason for moving Launch Pad 1
                    was...&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Phoenix"&gt;Because he wanted to hide
                    Launch Pad 1!&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Judge"&gt;Hmm, well, let's
                    suppose he did move it. Where in the world would he hide it? An enormous launch
                    pad like that... I highly doubt it could truly be
                    hidden.&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Phoenix"&gt;Oh, uh... behind
                    something, maybe...?&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Judge"&gt;Mr. Wright!
                    Are you asking me or telling me?!&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line
                    speaker="Phoenix"&gt;Urk. &lt;thought&gt;Looks like I messed that
                    up...&lt;/thought&gt; Your Honor! Please let me give it another
                    try!&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Phoenix"&gt;Because he wanted to trap
                    the true killer!&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line
                    speaker="Blackquill"&gt;............Hmph. Wright-dono, need I remind you there
                    was an explosion? And that the corridor between the launch pad and the lounge
                    was thick with smoke? If the killer had been trapped in there, they would've
                    been found as dead as their victim.&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line
                    speaker="Phoenix"&gt;I-I guess you're right.&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line
                    speaker="Judge"&gt;Well, I'm glad you both agree. Now here's a penalty for you,
                    Mr. Wright.&lt;/line&gt;<br />&lt;line speaker="Phoenix"&gt;&lt;thought&gt;I
                    don't agree with that penalty, though...&lt;/thought&gt; Your Honor! Please give
                    me another chance!&lt;/line&gt; </code>

            <p>Ace Attorney is a visual novel, so there's a ton of text, all of it appearing as
                dialogue between characters. To reflect this, out XML data contains all the
                'dialogue' with the speaker outlined in an attribute. So what data can we glean from
                this XML, and how exactly can we secure it?<br /> One piece of information we wanted
                to find was how many lines each speaker had. This is pretty simple to find in each
                individual file, but searching over our whole collection is a bit harder. We'll use
                a combination of XQuery, which lets you run XPath searches over collections of
                files, and PyVis, which'll let us display the data we select as a network with nodes
                and edges. <br /> For a full breakdown on the process, and to run the code yourself,
                    <a
                    href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rcc5418/BinderRepo/HEAD?labpath=AADataNetwork.ipynb"
                    target="_blank">check out this Jupyter Notebook!</a><br /> After running all
                that code and constructing our network, we end up with this:</p>
            <iframe class="nestedHTMLs" src="AAnetwork_graph.html"></iframe>
            <p>Cool! With this graph, it's clear that Phoenix, Edgeworth, Ryunosuke, Apollo, and the
                Judge are the most common speakers. Phoenix's position is obvious, as he's a main
                character in all 6 mainline games, and it's no surprise that Apollo makes the top
                cut as well, he's a protagonist in half the mainline games. It's interesting that
                Ryunosuke has more lines than Apollo though, as he's the protagonist in only 2
                    <i>spinoff</i> games. A similar phenomenon occurs with Edgeworth. Those with a
                passing knowledge of the series might be surprised that he's in second place when it
                comes to number of lines. He's the primary antagonist in the first game, and shows
                up once or twice in pretty much all the other games, but the real reason he has so
                many lines is that he stars in 2 of his <i>own</i> spin off games, the Ace Attorney
                Investigation games. It's amusing that the Judge appears here, but not surprising.
                Roughly half of the Ace Attorney games' gameplay takes place in the courtroom, where
                the Judge features prominently. He's never been a very defined character though, so
                his relevance over more memorable characters like Athena Cykes or Maya Fey is a bit
                baffling.<br /> We can refine our graph (and make it easier to read) by adjusting
                our coloring strategy and actually connecting our nodes together to form a long
                string from most prominent character to least prominent.<br />This process was
                detailed in the same notebook from earlier, so <a
                    href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rcc5418/BinderRepo/HEAD?labpath=AADataNetwork.ipynb"
                    target="_blank">revisit it if you'd like!</a><br /> Here's what our refined
                graph looks like:</p>
            <iframe class="nestedHTMLs" src="AAnetwork_graph_2.html"></iframe>
            <p>As an Ace Attorney fan, it was pretty fun to follow the path and find the first
                character I didn't recognize right away (It was Ryutaro; see how far down on the
                chain they are?). The number 75 was chosen arbitrarily, but it turned out to be
                pretty effective. Near the end of the trail, the characters start becoming pretty
                obscure. <br /> There is some data analysis that can only be done using NLP, natural
                language processing, to scan over our text and pick out certain types of word. In <a
                    target="_blank"
                    href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rcc5418/BinderRepo/HEAD?labpath=visualizingNLP.ipynb"
                    >this notebook,</a> we use XQuery to find all of the main character Phoenix's
                longest lines and picks out the proper nouns used most often, but you're encouraged
                to mess with the code yourself to find something different! Regardless, here's the
                bar graph created from the data we picked out:</p>
            <img alt="A bar graph depicting the proper nouns used most commonly by Phoenix Wright"
                class="centerIMG" src="images/phoenixLines_VisualizedNLP.png">
            <p>This data is pretty flawed. Those familiar with the franchise would recognize that
                there's no reason for the character Olga Orly to show up so prominently, she's only
                in ONE case! I believe this is the result of our data-sparsing technique. For
                brevity, we only analyzed lines above 300 characters, so I guess Phoenix was just
                going off about this Olga lady at one point for one reason or another. Undoubtedly,
                if our data-sparsing technique was refined a bit, we'd make a more accurate
                graph.</p>
