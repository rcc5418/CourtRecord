Case: The Stolen Sword

Location: District Courtroom No. 4

Date: April 12, 2024

Defendant: Miles Edgeworth

Prosecutor: Phoenix Wright

Defense Attorney: Apollo Justice

Judge: Judge (unnamed)

Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Miles Edgeworth. Is the prosecution ready?

Phoenix: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.

Judge: And is the defense prepared?

Apollo: The defense is ready, Your Honor.

Judge: Very well. Mr. Wright, you may present your opening statement.

Phoenix: Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the court, today we are here to discuss a theft of great importance. The treasured Sword of Khura'in, a priceless artifact, has been stolen from the Khura'in Embassy. The evidence points to the defendant, Miles Edgeworth, as the perpetrator of this crime. We will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is guilty.

Apollo: Objection, Your Honor! The prosecution's opening statement is baseless conjecture. There is no concrete evidence linking my client to the theft of the Sword of Khura'in.

Judge: Objection sustained. Mr. Wright, please stick to the facts.

Phoenix: My apologies, Your Honor. However, I assure you, the evidence will speak for itself.

Judge: Very well. Mr. Justice, you may present your opening statement.

Apollo: Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the court, my client, Miles Edgeworth, is innocent of these accusations. He is a respected prosecutor with an unblemished record. The prosecution's case is built on circumstantial evidence and speculation. We will demonstrate that there is reasonable doubt regarding Mr. Edgeworth's guilt.

Judge: Thank you, Mr. Justice. Let the trial commence with the prosecution's first witness.

Phoenix: The prosecution calls Detective Dick Gumshoe to the stand.

Judge: Detective Gumshoe, please state your name and occupation for the record.

Gumshoe: I'm Dick Gumshoe, a detective with the local precinct.

Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, can you tell the court what you discovered during your investigation of the theft at the Khura'in Embassy?

Gumshoe: Sure thing, pal. We found fingerprints on the display case where the Sword of Khura'in was kept. Those prints matched the defendant, Miles Edgeworth.

Apollo: Objection, Your Honor! The defense requests to see the fingerprint evidence.

Judge: Objection overruled. Detective Gumshoe, please present the fingerprint evidence to the court.

Gumshoe: Um, well, you see, we, uh, seem to have misplaced the evidence, pal.

Apollo: Your Honor, this is highly irregular! How can the prosecution expect us to believe their claims without presenting proper evidence?

Judge: Mr. Wright, do you have any other evidence to support your case?

Phoenix: Um, well, Your Honor, it seems there has been a slight oversight in the handling of the evidence. However, I assure you, the fingerprints were conclusively matched to the defendant.

Judge: Very well. The prosecution may proceed with its case.

Phoenix: The prosecution calls the next witness, Maya Fey.

Judge: Miss Fey, please state your name and occupation for the record.

Maya: I'm Maya Fey, a spirit medium from the Fey clan.

Phoenix: Miss Fey, you were present at the Khura'in Embassy on the night of the theft, correct?

Maya: Yeah, that's right. I was channeling the spirit of the founder of Khura'in when the theft occurred.

Phoenix: And did you see anyone suspicious near the display case?

Maya: Well, I didn't see anyone near the display case, but I did sense a dark presence in the room.

Apollo: Objection, Your Honor! Miss Fey's testimony is based on spiritual beliefs and is not admissible as evidence.

Judge: Objection sustained. Miss Fey's testimony will be stricken from the record.

Phoenix: Very well, Your Honor. The prosecution has no further witnesses at this time.

Judge: Mr. Justice, does the defense wish to cross-examine the witness?

Apollo: No, Your Honor. The defense has no questions for this witness.

Judge: Very well. The prosecution may call its next witness.

Phoenix: The prosecution calls Miles Edgeworth to the stand.

Judge: Mr. Edgeworth, please state your name and occupation for the record.

Edgeworth: Miles Edgeworth, Chief Prosecutor of the District Prosecutors' Office.

Phoenix: Mr. Edgeworth, were you present at the Khura'in Embassy on the night of the theft?

Edgeworth: Yes, I was.

Phoenix: And did you steal the Sword of Khura'in?

Edgeworth: Absolutely not! I would never stoop to such a low act.

Apollo: Objection, Your Honor! The defense requests that the witness's statement be stricken from the record. It is a mere assertion without any supporting evidence.

Judge: Objection sustained. Mr. Edgeworth, please refrain from making unsubstantiated claims.

Phoenix: No further questions, Your Honor.

Judge: Mr. Justice, does the defense wish to cross-examine the witness?

Apollo: Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Edgeworth, can you provide an alibi for your whereabouts at the time of the theft?

Edgeworth: I was in the ambassador's office discussing a legal matter at the time of the theft. Unfortunately, there were no witnesses to corroborate my alibi.

Apollo: Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. No further questions.

Judge: Very well. The witness may step down. Does the prosecution have any further witnesses?

Phoenix: No, Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case.

Judge: Very well. Mr. Justice, you may present your case for the defense.

Apollo: Thank you, Your Honor. The defense calls to the stand... Maya Fey.

Judge: Miss Fey, please state your name and occupation for the record.

Maya: I'm Maya Fey, a spirit medium from the Fey clan.

Apollo: Miss Fey, can you recall any details from the night of the theft that may help exonerate my client?

Maya: Well, I remember sensing a presence in the room, but it didn't feel like Mr. Edgeworth's. It was more... malevolent.

Apollo: And did you see anyone else in the room besides Mr. Edgeworth?

Maya: No, I didn't see anyone else.

Apollo: Thank you, Miss Fey. No further questions.

Judge: Mr. Wright, does the prosecution wish to cross-examine the witness?

Phoenix: No, Your Honor. The prosecution has no further questions for this witness.

Judge: Very well. Miss Fey, you may step down.

Apollo: Your Honor, the defense rests its case.

Judge: Very well. Mr. Wright, you may present your closing argument.

Phoenix: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the prosecution has presented compelling evidence that points to Miles Edgeworth as the perpetrator of this crime. Despite the defense's attempts to cast doubt, the facts remain clear. Mr. Edgeworth's fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime, and he had the opportunity to commit the theft. I urge you to find him guilty and deliver justice for the theft of the Sword of Khura'in.

Judge: Thank you, Mr. Wright. Mr. Justice, your closing argument?

Apollo: Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the prosecution's case is built on circumstantial evidence and speculation. There is no concrete proof that my client, Miles Edgeworth, committed this crime. The prosecution's key witness, Maya Fey, even sensed a different presence in the room at the time of the theft. Without solid evidence, you cannot convict Mr. Edgeworth. I urge you to find him not guilty and uphold the principles of justice.

Judge: Thank you, Mr. Justice. Members of the jury, you have heard the arguments from both the prosecution and the defense. It is now time for you to deliberate and reach a verdict.

(After a brief deliberation)

Judge: Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?

Jury Foreman: Yes, Your Honor. We find the defendant, Miles Edgeworth...

Judge: Please continue.

Jury Foreman: ...not guilty.

Apollo: Yes! Thank you, Your Honor.

Phoenix: (sighs) Another case slips through my fingers...

Judge: The court accepts the jury's verdict. Mr. Edgeworth, you are free to go. Court is adjourned.
