                    Kayla Hopple, a gamer girl, a digital art major, and a game design minor! Prior
                    to this project, I knew very little about Ace Attorney, and the only visual
                    novel I've played was Hatoful Boyfriend. I play more platform games, party
                    games, and adventure games. My favorite video games are Sonic the Hedgehog,
                    Super Mario, and Minecraft. As we progressed through the project, I started
                    learning what it's like to play the games and what to expect! I was in charge of
                    designing the websites for this project, which helps with perfecting graphic
                    design techniques needed for my future career as a video game graphic
                    designer!</p>

                    My name is Alyssa Hopple. I am also a gamer girl and a junior at Penn State
                    majoring in DIGIT with a minor in game design. I am also new to Ace Attorney,
                    and my favorite video game franchises are Metroid, Dance Dance Revolution, and
                    Pok√©mon. Every time we came together to work on this project, I learned a little
                    more about this franchise, which gradually got me even more interested not only
                    in the franchise itself, but I would also go on to draw fanart of some of the
                    characters in Ace Attorney, such as the legendary Phoenix Wright! In this
                    semester project, my role was an assistant programmer, utilizing coding
                    techniques on various transcripts of a few Ace Attorney games such as Regex and
                    Jupyter Lab (uses Python).</p>

                    a DIGIT major and massive fan of the Ace Attorney franchise. Doing this project
                    on Ace Attorney was actually my idea, as I thought making a text-generative
                    model using the series could be interesting, and because I had a good idea that
                    all the data we'd need could be found readily online. The Ace Attorney franchise
                    has a very active online fanbase, even though the series hasn't seen a
                        <i>new</i> game for a couple of years now. Regardless, working on this
                    project has been a lot of fun!</p>
