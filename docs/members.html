                <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Kayla Hopple</span><br />Hi! I'm
                    Kayla Hopple, a gamer girl, a digital art major, and a game design minor! Prior
                    to this project, I knew very little about Ace Attorney, and the only visual
                    novel I've played was Hatoful Boyfriend. I play more platform games, party
                    games, and adventure games. My favorite video games are Sonic the Hedgehog,
                    Super Mario, and Minecraft. As we progressed through the project, I started
                    learning what it's like to play the games and what to expect! I was in charge of
                    designing the websites for this project, which helps with perfecting graphic
                    design techniques needed for my future career as a video game graphic
                    designer!</p>
