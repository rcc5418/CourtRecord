                <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Kayla Hopple</span><br />Hi! I'm
                    Kayla Hopple, a gamer girl, a digital art major, and a game design minor! Prior
                    to this project, I knew very little about Ace Attorney, and the only visual
                    novel I've played was Hatoful Boyfriend. I play more platform games, party
                    games, and adventure games. My favorite video games are Sonic the Hedgehog,
                    Super Mario, and Minecraft. As we progressed through the project, I started
                    learning what it's like to play the games and what to expect! I was in charge of
                    designing the websites for this project, which helps with perfecting graphic
                    design techniques needed for my future career as a video game graphic
                    designer!</p>

                    a DIGIT major and massive fan of the Ace Attorney franchise. Doing this project
                    on Ace Attorney was actually my idea, as I thought making a text-generative
                    model using the series could be interesting, and because I had a good idea that
                    all the data we'd need could be found readily online. The Ace Attorney franchise
                    has a very active online fanbase, even though the series hasn't seen a
                        <i>new</i> game for a couple of years now. Regardless, working on this
                    project has been a lot of fun!</p>
