                    problem I had while developing this website was trying to make the background
                    appear throughout the entire webpage without any white bars sticking out of it.
                    I tried various CSS codes to adjust the size and position of the image, but it
                    always led to white bars sticking out of the top and bottom no matter what. I
                    then turned to ChatGPT for a solution, and it told me to adjust the margins in
                    the body. I even had some problems making sure the text fit in the buttons,
                    especially when I tried to adjust the size of both the buttons and the text,
                    which I also contacted ChatGPT about, and it told me to adjust the size of the
                    text and the padding, height, and width of the buttons to fit the text in the
                    buttons.<br />Another problem was trying to make the word cloud have more
                    relevant data. I tried to look for ways I could get rid of unnecessary words
                    like "I," "an," "the," or "of," among others by trying to see if I could remove
                    them within Antconc, but I could not find a way and then tried looking up ways
                    to make it work. Using what I learned from there, I tried to find the
                    suggestions within Antconc but had difficulty looking for them despite following
                    the directions. Finally, I decided to make a whole new XML text corpus with the
                    mentioned words removed with the "Find and Replace" feature by searching for
                    each word and replacing it with a space. <br />What I thought we could do
                    differently, other than making the AI work properly, is provide more visuals
                    about data from different games, especially word clouds about the most frequent
                    words. Other than that, we thought our website looked pretty well-made.<br />

                <p class="characters"><span class="character_name">Alyssa Hopple</span><br />As we
                    worked on our project together, I faced some hardships with some of the tasks
                    required for the completion of our semester project. As an assistant programmer,
                    the hardest thing I did was use Regex to convert TXT to XML after the text had
                    been extracted from the HTML pages of the ACE ATTORNEY Wiki. I had tried to use
                    different kinds of Regex code, including some new Regex codes we have never
                    learned in this class, to try to wrap around each line, marked by a specific
                    character who said that line. Many parts of the TXT extracted from the Wiki
                    includes "i" and "Leads to" elements, which I had a hard time getting rid of.
                    With the assistance of Reece, as well as our professor, I have gotten less bugs
                    as I utilized the right Regex codes for this portion of the semester project.
                    <br />Another hardship I faced is tinkering with the PyVis used to highlight
                    frequent terms said by all characters, which was a Jupyter notebook originally
                    written by our professor. I attempted to adapt that Jupyter notebook into our
                    research, but I received undesirable programming results. However, Reece decided
                    to take the helm and come up with a different graph with a similar evaluation,
                    which is the most frequent terms said by Phoenix Wright himself.</p>

                    obstacle ended up being training the TensorFlow model to generate text. It
                    involved so much fenagling with the example code to get it to work with our
                    data, and then so long to train, that I kind of gave up on improving that model
                    to try and generate something cohesive. I don't think that's a big loss,
                    however, as the larger problem (I believe at least) is in our data. Everything
                    is a bit too same-y, so when I would try to make the model less creative, it
                    would just generate a bunch of super common words, like 'the', 'and', 'for',
                    nothing unique to the Ace Attorney franchise. I wish I had chronicled all the
                    generations I did more!<br /> Something I ended up doing for one of our
                    visualizations was creating a sub-folder in our text corpus containing only the
                    chapters of the <i>first</i> game. An interesting avenue we could've followed
                    would be to create similar folders for all the games, and done analysis on each
                    game separately then compared our results. However, this would've been an
                    arduous process, not even I, a huge Ace Attorney fan, could do this without
                    checking back and forth with the wiki over and over again. I didn't want to do
                    this as it would've felt unnatural to me. If we had more time and a larger
                    visualization/analysis quota I definitely would've done it.</p>
