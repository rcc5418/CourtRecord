            <p>This project is based on the dialogue from the Ace Attorney visual novel franchise,
                developed and published by Capcom. <br /> The series first released in 2001, on the
                Gameboy, but since then, the series has had 8 major installments and 3 spinoff
                titles, and between rereleases and bundles, the franchise is playable on every modern major
                console.<br /> As you can imagine, the franchise has a ton of text, text is what
                half of the entire game genre is composed of. What data could you glean from all
                that text?<br /> Additionally, what would a text-generative model look like trained
                entirely on the games' text? Could AI hold a candle to one of the most prestigious
                visual novels out there? Court is in session!<br /> Here's a short guide to the
                pages on this site: </p>
