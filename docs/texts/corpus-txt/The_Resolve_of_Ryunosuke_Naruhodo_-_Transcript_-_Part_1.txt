Final ChapterThe Resolve of Ryunosuke Naruhodo
3rd November, 9:14 a.m.
The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber
Ryunosuke:
(So...the time's finally come. Today...we unravel everything!) I'll be counting on your support more than ever today, Miss Susato!
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Um... Miss Susato?
Susato:
Ah! Oh no! W-What's the matter, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Um...nothing? I was just saying that I'll be relying on your support today, but...
Susato:
I'm so sorry! Of course! I, I know I can be rather incompetent at times, but... ...I shan't let you down!
Ryunosuke:
...Would you mind helping me to my feet, then?
Susato:
Oh dear! I'm really very sorry!
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san isn't her usual self at all. But that's hardly surprising, I suppose. She's just found out that her father is the partner of a world-famous detective. Not to mention...)
Susato:
Ah! G-Good morning, sir!
Ryunosuke:
...! Lord van Zieks!
Van Zieks:
Thank you for all your efforts yesterday.
Ryunosuke:
Wha... (Did I hear that correctly?)
Van Zieks:
...What?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um, no, nothing. Just...I hope we can clear things up today. (I really can't make this man out. His face says 'I hate you' but his words are...almost jovial today. In fact, he hasn't been very Reaper-like at all since this all began yesterday.)
Susato:
Lord van Zieks isn't the Reaper, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
...Good point.
Van Zieks:
The Reaper? I suppose in hindsight... ...I shouldn't have allowed that misconception to go unchallenged.
Ryunosuke:
Huh?
Van Zieks:
It was my tacit acceptance of the pseudonym... My failure to stop the Reaper becoming something more than a mere legend...that led to all this.
Susato:
But you're not to blame for that, Lord van Zieks!
Ryunosuke:
It's only because serious crime in the capital dropped off so sharply when the public started calling you that. That's why you didn't say anything, isn't it?
Van Zieks:
...To be frank, I'm not sure that was the sole reason.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Van Zieks:
There was a rumour at the time that the Reaper was really the ghost of my late brother.
Susato:
...!
Van Zieks:
That having been slain by that evil killer, Klint's restless spirit returned as some sort of demigod... ...to wield a deadly blade of justice where I, by dint of the law, could not.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...we've heard that story too.
Van Zieks:
When I lost him... ...I felt as though I'd lost my guiding light.  I didn't know where to go or what to do. And so... ...in some small way, I wonder if perhaps those rumours made me feel his absence a little less keenly. Even if I knew it was just an illusion. Just some nonsense conjured up by an over-imaginative public.
Susato:
He was obviously extremely important to you. Lord Klint van Zieks...
Ryunosuke:
Well...what's important now is uncovering the truth. That's all that matters. I...know that you didn't take anyone's life.
Van Zieks:
...!
Ryunosuke:
And I intend to prove that beyond a shadow of a doubt in court today.
Van Zieks:
......... I never thought I'd say this... ...but I can see it in your eyes. That burning desire to cut through all the lies and deception. I can't deny it any longer. You...are a lawyer of absolute integrity.
Ryunosuke:
...Thank you.
Van Zieks:
Now tell me... ...why do I detect the scent of expensive tea leaves in the air?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Iris! When did you get here?
Susato:
Oh!
Iris:
Ah! Um... I brought you one of my special blends. Hurley loves it. He says it helps him to clear his head!
Van Zieks:
...I thank you.
Iris:
Oh... Hee hee...
Ryunosuke:
(That's surely the first and last time I'll ever see a sight like this...) You seem different today, Iris.
Iris:
Oh...?
Ryunosuke:
Sort of...subdued, I suppose.
Iris:
I am not!
Ryunosuke:
(What happened yesterday is obviously still playing on her mind a lot. She's clearly very troubled about having stolen that autopsy report from Dr Sithe's laboratory.)
Iris:
Alright then...good luck to you both! I have to make a move now.
Susato:
Oh! You're not staying?
Ryunosuke:
I thought you'd want to watch today's proceedings.
Iris:
Well...I'd like to cheer you on, obviously. But I've got lots to get ready.
Ryunosuke:
Get ready? For what?
Iris:
Oh, yes. Would you take this?
Ryunosuke:
Isn't that one of the little felt dolls that's usually dangling from your knapsack?
Iris:
Yes! It's a lucky charm! A little Hurley that I made once.
Ryunosuke:
A 'Hurley'? (It looks more like a 'Hareley' to me...)
Iris:
If for some reason you completely run out of options in the trial today... ...then just pull this little Hurley's ears as hard as you possibly can!
Ryunosuke:
Wha...? Pull his ears?
Iris:
That's right! It's a way to bring good luck. ...I think you might need it!
Iris's lucky charm has been entered into the Court Record.
Susato:
Y-You think...what we'll need is luck...?
Examine evidence
Iris's Lucky Charm
Ears
Susato:
What a charming little rabbity version of Mr Sholmes. Do you suppose this is how Iris sees him?
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo? Your eyes are veritably boring into the poor doll's ears.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, sorry. I was just wondering... What do you suppose would happen if I were to tug its ears with all my might right now?!
Susato:
I'm sure that we'll find out...when the time is right. To become a proper gentleman, you really must learn stoic patience!
Ryunosuke:
(...But I want to know!)
Iris:
I just sneaked a peek inside the courtroom. And...it seemed very different to normal.
Van Zieks:
Yes, it would seem... ...that a certain someone has decided to pull out all the stops.
Ryunosuke:
What does that mean?
Van Zieks:
.........
Susato:
What about Mr Sholmes, Iris?
Iris:
I...don't know. He was out all night and he hadn't come home by the time I left this morning.
Susato:
Oh... I see...
Ryunosuke:
Was Professor Mikotoba out all night too, do you think, Miss Susato?
Susato:
Yes, it would seem so. I telegrammed the hotel this morning... ...and apparently they didn't come back to their rooms last night at all.
Ryunosuke:
'They'?
Susato:
Father and Judge Jigoku, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
Judge Jigoku, too?
Susato:
That's right. Nobody appears to have seen either of them since yesterday.
Bailiff:
Counsel for the Defence and the defendant! Court is about to be in session. Please make your way inside the courtroom at once!
Iris:
Good luck then, Runo! Good luck, Susie!
Ryunosuke:
Yes...thanks, Iris.
Iris:
And you, Mr Reaper. I hope it goes well!
Van Zieks:
Once again, I thank you for the delicious tea, It was very soothing.
Iris:
Oh, I'm so glad!
Susato:
We must go inside now, Lord van Zieks!
Van Zieks:
Hm...
Ryunosuke:
(Lord van Zieks has always been the formidable prosecutor I've had to lock horns with in court. But not today. Today I battle with another in pursuit of the truth. My best friend, Kazuma Asogi, who I trust more than anyone else in the world. Now I understand what it was that drew me here to Britain all those months ago. Now I know exactly what destiny had in store for me. It's all been leading up to this one day... To this one trial... To this one final reckoning!)
3rd November, 9:30 a.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Ryunosuke:
It feels even more oppressive here than it did yesterday... (There are cold stares piercing me like knives from all sides today.)
Susato:
Ah! M-Mr Naruhodo! Look!
Ryunosuke:
L... Lord Stronghart!
Kazuma:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Kazuma must have known beforehand...)
Stronghart:
The ramifications of this trial now extend far beyond the murder of one Scotland Yard inspector. In fact, events have come to light that threaten to rock the very foundations of our country's legal system.
Kazuma:
The escape of a condemned criminal on the night of his execution...the subsequent unlawful shooting of the man... ...and the revelation that prison staff must have been complicit in the jailbreak.
Stronghart:
Britain is currently hosting influential members of the judiciary from countries all around the world. It is imperative that we uncover the truth in these proceedings to avoid international embarrassment. By royal decree, this will continue to be a closed trial... ...and one over which I, Mael Stronghart, exercise total and unequivocal authority.
Ryunosuke:
The, the six jurors' flames just...
Stronghart:
As was the case in yesterday's proceedings, those here present in the public gallery... ...are distinguished members of our judiciary, assembled to bear witness to a fair judicial process.
Van Zieks:
In other words...a collection of your acolytes, Lord Stronghart.
Stronghart:
......... On a personal note, I find this most distressing, Lord van Zieks. You were a prosecutor of exceptional talent. Much like your brother Klint in fact...
Van Zieks:
.........
Stronghart:
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session... ...for the trial of Barok van Zieks, who officially stands accused of murder.
Van Zieks:
.........
Stronghart:
Counsels for the prosecution and defense...are you in full readiness to proceed?
Ryunosuke:
The defence is ready...My Lord.
Kazuma:
As is the prosecution.
Stronghart:
Yesterday's proceedings brought to light a shocking and disturbing fact: There was a side to the victim, Inspector Tobias Gregson, that was unknown to his superiors at Scotland Yard.
Kazuma:
Yes, he was carrying out operations in secret, which Scotland Yard knew nothing about.
Stronghart:
And in those clandestine operations, he had an accomplice.
Kazuma:
Mr Daley Vigil, who would be given the inspector's identification... ...and present himself around the capital in order to establish credible alibis for Gregson. In that way, Gregson appeared to be carrying out his regular Scotland Yard work when in fact he wasn't.
Stronghart:
At the end of yesterday's session, Mr Vigil, who had been suffering from amnesia, regained his memory. It would appear he buried his memories of the time deep inside himself as a means of self-preservation. Because whilst he was engaged as chief warder at Barclay Prison, he abetted the convict's escape.
Kazuma:
Mr Vigil is currently recuperating at St Synner's. He's recovered enough to give a signed statement about his movements on the day prior to the incident. He's formally admitted to posing as Gregson whilst investigating the Red-Headed League.
Stronghart:
Which brings us to the crucial issue of the victim's time of death. The defence yesterday proposed a suggestion that the victim may have been killed one day earlier. This was based largely on the discovery that the victim's pocket watch had not been wound.
Kazuma:
The prosecution has something to report on that subject, My Lord.
Stronghart:
Really? Go ahead, Prosecutor Asogi.
Kazuma:
I met once again with the coroner yesterday to discuss the issue. She confirmed that the defence's suggestion could not be ruled out.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
It's entirely possible that Inspector Gregson was killed on 31st October - the day before his body was discovered. I have here an updated autopsy report that includes the amended details.
Stronghart:
But the official opinion of the investigation team was made clear yesterday. That the time of death was 5 p.m. on 1st November.
Kazuma:
There are indications of an attempt to disguise the real time of death, however. It seems that the natural decaying process of the victim's body may have been slowed by keeping it chilled.
Stronghart:
That's out of the question. There are no refrigeration devices in that part of London large enough to accommodate a human corpse.
Ryunosuke:
My Lord! This is more than just conjecture. There's evidence to support the idea. We must investigate it thoroughly.
Stronghart:
...Very well. The court will accept the new report as evidence. However, if this updated report is deemed to be accurate... ...it would give renewed significance to the movements of the victim on the day before the Fresno Street incident.
Kazuma:
It would, yes. Especially since on that day... ...Inspector Gregson was using Mr Vigil to cover up his real movements. It's conceivable that he was killed in the course of his secret activities.
Stronghart:
Do I sense that the prosecution has some information regarding those activities?
Kazuma:
Scotland Yard put an enormous effort into investigating that precise matter yesterday.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
I think we should begin by presenting the results of that investigation work. So the prosecution calls its first witness now!
Kazuma:
State your name and occupation for the court.
Gina:
Inspector Gina Lestrade, reportin'! Reper...sentive o' Scotland Yard!
Kazuma:
...A self-conferred rank, but never mind.
Ryunosuke:
(Gina? Again?)
Gina:
Wot's yer problem, 'Oddo? Wot's wiv that 'Gina? Again?' look, eh?
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Gina:
The boss meant the world to me. 'E done more for me than anyone else ever did!
Stronghart:
Oh? Inspector Gregson, you mean?
Gina:
'E got me out the back slums o' the East End an' took me under 'is wing. Taught me that life can 'ave a purpose. So that's why I'm the best person to be standin' 'ere speakin' for 'im!
Susato:
Oh Gina...
Ryunosuke:
(Right, all out of the goodness of Gregson's heart. Not at all that he had his arm twisted by Mr Sholmes. No...)
Kazuma:
What's relevant to these proceedings is that the outcome of Scotland Yard's investigations yesterday... ...has revealed that the victim was carrying out some assignment the police knew nothing about.
Stronghart:
Very troubling...
Ryunosuke:
(That face... Lord Stronghart knew!)
Kazuma:
So...Inspector Lestrade! Let's hear exactly what it says in that report!
Gina:
Comin' right up, sir!
Witness Testimony
- The Victim's Movements -
Gina:
All Yard detectives are s'posed to follow orders an' investigate wot they're told.
But a little search o' the boss's office turned up a notebook that 'ad a load of secret meetin's in it.
Accordin' to that, the boss was lookin' into some smuggled goods dealin's that day.
Looks like it was a big job an' all. But the coppers weren't on to it yet.
Wot matters most is, there's witnesses wot saw the Reaper at the place, too!
Ryunosuke:
Smuggled goods?!
Gina:
I dunno, do I? I'm just tellin' ya wot was written in the book!
Kazuma:
Tobacco, tea, spices, medicines... Goods of all sorts flow into London by illegal channels from across the globe. It's well known that they're disposed of at regular black markets that take place in the capital. But the police are rarely able to locate them in time.
Ryunosuke:
So Inspector Gregson was investigating one of those black markets?
Stronghart:
It's been suggested that high-ranking government officials may be involved in black-market activity. No doubt Gregson was trying to avoid details of his investigations being leaked to the involved parties. That would explain why he was operating on his own authority, without the Yard's knowledge.
Ryunosuke:
And do we know where the dealings were taking place this time?
Kazuma:
In a particular room of a certain exclusive London gentleman's club. And on the day in question...the accused is known to have been there. That's the conclusion of Scotland Yard's investigation into the matter.
Ryunosuke:
That can't be...! (We haven't heard anything about any of this!)
Kazuma:
Members of the club have testified to it. There's no question: the accused, Barok van Zieks, was present.
Stronghart:
That would be very significant testimony, then.
Susato:
Oh my! But, but... ...Lord van Zieks made no mention of this! At all!
Kazuma:
In short, Lord van Zieks had ample opportunity to murder the victim.
Stronghart:
Very well, then. Counsel for the Defence, begin your cross-examination!
Cross-Examination
- The Victim's Movements -
Gina:
All Yard detectives are s'posed to follow orders an' investigate wot they're told.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So...you follow orders, do you, Gina?
Gina:
Nah, not me. I'm above all that, see.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Gina:
The boss always 'ad special orders for me. 'Grab us some fish an' chips' or 'Go an' give Toby 'is grub'... That kind o' thing.
Ryunosuke:
...So 'errands' more than 'orders' then.
Kazuma:
This 'detective' is still an apprentice, after all.
Gina:
Yeah, well, this 'apprentice' ain't one to sit around an' wait to be told wot to do...even by the boss. That's why I've been doin' me own investigations into wot 'appened. I didn't find much at first...
Gina:
But a little search o' the boss's office turned up a notebook that 'ad a load of secret meetin's in it.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So you went through Inspector Gregson's things?
Gina:
Yup! As part o' the independent Lestrade investigation!
Ryunosuke:
I'm sure your superiors would be delighted that you're taking the initiative...
Gina:
So I snuck into 'is office when no one else was about. Cos if anyone at the Yard 'ad seen me goin' in there, they'd 'ave turfed me straight out on the street.
Ryunosuke:
(This is sounding less and less like an investigation and more and more like something else...)
Kazuma:
The prosecution understands that it was this very detective who discovered the notebook.
Gina:
You got that right! Nuffin' gets past Inspector Lestrade and 'er trusty assistant, Chief Inspector Toby! We found it 'idden in one of 'is desk drawers that 'ad a false bottom.
Ryunosuke:
That's...impressive!
Gina:
So then I went to 'ide meself where no one could find me so I could 'ave a butcher's at wot was written in it. Cos if anyone at the Yard 'ad found me out, they'd 'ave turfed me straight out on the street.
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Gina:
I've given it in now though, ain't I? An' if it weren't for me, it wouldn't never 'ave been found!
Gina:
Accordin' to that, the boss was lookin' into some smuggled goods dealin's that day.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Do you have any idea where those dealings were taking place?
Gina:
Yup! It was all there in the boss's notes! Let's see if I can remember... Erm...
Kazuma:
As I already said, the illegal dealings were due to take place at a gentleman's club.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I remember. But I was hoping to find out the name of the club.
Kazuma:
That won't be necessary.
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Kazuma:
It's conceivable that the club might be used again by the smugglers in future. Therefore...the prosecution has been asked not to reveal the name in these proceedings.
Gina:
I dunno wot all the fuss is about. It's right 'ere. All I've gotta do is read it out. An' I could, too! I've got this readin' game buttoned up now! Can't I show ya wot I can do? Go on, wot's the 'arm?
Ryunosuke:
(The judge hasn't signalled his objection yet. I could try to find out... What should I do?)
Insist
Ryunosuke:
This is a closed court. The proceedings are confidential. There shouldn't be any possibility of the information being leaked.
Stronghart:
As I explained, there is some possibility of politicians being involved in this affair. The prosecution is rightfully exercising caution, I imagine.
Kazuma:
......... No, My Lord. The prosecution has no objection.
Stronghart:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma?
Kazuma:
There's no question that Inspector Gregson was looking into these black market dealings. However... ...it's not yet been established that he was on that particular trail on the day in question. If the defence requires to know the club's name, the prosecution has no intention of being obstructive.
Stronghart:
.........
Gina:
Right then! I get to show off me readin' skills!
Changes statement from "Accordin' to that, the boss was lookin' into some smuggled goods dealin's that day." to "Apparently the smuggled goods deal was gonna 'appen at a gentleman's club called 'The Grouse'."
Wait and see
Ryunosuke:
(Gina's only just learnt to read. There's a good chance she might make a mistake... I worry she might mix up the letters 'p' and 'q' and 'b' and 'd'...)
Gina:
That's enough o' your cheek, 'Oddo! I'm way past 'E' now! I've got all the way to 'V'!
Ryunosuke:
Just to err on the side of caution, the defence will wait until the witness can read all the letters up to 'Z'!
Gina:
Grrr...
Kazuma:
In that case, let's get back to the witness's testimony, shall we?
Leads back to cross-examination
Gina:
Apparently the smuggled goods deal was gonna 'appen at a gentleman's club called 'The Grouse'.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
The Grouse? What sort of a club is that?
Gina:
I ain't got the foggiest. Clubs ain't exactly my thing. But...I am kind o' curious!
Kazuma:
They're not places where a foreign student like you would be readily admitted.
Ryunosuke:
Have you looked in the mirror recently?
Gina:
I tell ya wot! Me and Chief Inspector Toby could go in undercover!
Ryunosuke:
Could you, though?
Gina:
I could pick out a few good marks an' see wot else I could find out while I was in there!
Ryunosuke:
...I really don't think you should go 'picking' out anything. Anyway, that's where these black market dealings were going to take place, is it?
Gina:
Yeah, it's gotta be. That's wot the lower-rankin' detectives at the Yard reckon.
Ryunosuke:
(Says the even lower-ranking detective...)
Present Letter of Introduction (after examining other side of note)
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I've read about these clubs that exist here in Britain."
Gina:
Looks like it was a big job an' all. But the coppers weren't on to it yet.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So how had Inspector Gregson come to find out about it, in that case?
Gina:
That's the question, ain't it? But I'm just an apprentice, so...
Ryunosuke:
And why didn't he inform Scotland Yard of his findings?
Gina:
Yeah, that's wot I was askin' meself. Cos - ya know - I'm just an apprentice.
Ryunosuke:
When it suits you, yes.
Gina:
Anyway, the point is, somefin' went on at that club, no question.
Ryunosuke:
You can't say that for certain though, surely?
Gina:
Wot matters most is, there's witnesses wot saw the Reaper at the place, too!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks was at the club?
Kazuma:
He was. Detectives who visited the club yesterday to make inquiries have confirmed it. Several members report having seen the accused being admitted to the room in question as a guest.
Ryunosuke:
(It looks like there's no disputing that he was there then.)
Susato:
Well we know that Lord van Zieks was investigating Inspector Gregson, don't we? Perhaps he'd already discovered the inspector's secret notebook.
Ryunosuke:
(Which led him to the club, you mean? Maybe...) Presumably then, there are also eyewitnesses who can testify that Gregson was there?
Kazuma:
......... None have been identified at this time, no.
Ryunosuke:
(So the all-important victim wasn't seen at this mysterious club...)
Gina:
Oi! Why ain't you askin' Inspector Lestrade 'ere, eh?
Ryunosuke:
(So that's all I've got to work with... Gina's not holding back with that ice-cold stare of hers, is she?)
Susato:
I really don't know what to make of all this.
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks told us that he was investigating Inspector Gregson... ...but he never once mentioned that he met the inspector the day before the incident.
Susato:
You don't think Lord van Zieks could have been lying to us, do you?
Ryunosuke:
...That's not the only way to explain this.
Susato:
Oh!
Ryunosuke:
If everything Lord van Zieks has told us is true... ...then there must be a mistake in this testimony somewhere.
Susato:
...! You mean, there are details we've yet to uncover?
Ryunosuke:
Exactly. (A clue perhaps, that even Gina hasn't noticed. That's what we should be looking for here!)
Ryunosuke:
I've read about these clubs that exist here in Britain. As I understand it, they're places where well-to-do gentlemen socialise with friends and colleagues.
Kazuma:
Don't imagine for a second that a foreign student like you would be admitted.
Ryunosuke:
(Seriously, is your mirror cracked or something?) Do we know for sure that the contraband dealings were definitely happening at a club called 'The Grouse'?
Kazuma:
...The police are currently looking for evidence... but haven't found anything definitive yet.
Ryunosuke:
And I'm sorry to say that they probably won't.
Kazuma:
What do you mean by that?
Ryunosuke:
I mean that the place Inspector Gregson was secretly going to visit on 31st October... ...may not have been a gentleman's club at all.
Stronghart:
...You're showing a very irreverent attitude towards our country's police force there, Counsel. If it wasn't a gentleman's club...then what was it?
Ryunosuke:
...A steamship.
Kazuma:
You think...it's a ship...?
Ryunosuke:
I have the evidence to prove it here!
Stronghart:
Let me see that. 'This dark-suited young man is not in the least bit untrustworthy.'
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Um...the other side, My Lord.
Stronghart:
...Be more specific next time. ...! Ah... This would appear to be a ticket for passage upon a steamship, yes... The SS Grouse...
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
So there's a steamship named the Grouse that happens to share a name with the club. But I'm afraid to say... ...there's a flaw in your logic there.
Ryunosuke:
How?
Kazuma:
Look at the ticket. Notice the date of arrival in port.
Stronghart:
The ship arrived at the Port of Dover on 1st November. ...Ah!
Kazuma:
The day on which the sound like a gunshot was heard on Fresno Street. In other words... ...on the day in question here - 31st October - when the victim was on his clandestine mission... ...that ship hadn't yet docked on British shores!
Stronghart:
That would certainly make an undercover investigation somewhat challenging.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
The fact that the steamship hadn't yet reached Britain... ...substantiates the defence's assertion that the victim was investigating the SS Grouse on the day in question!
Kazuma:
Then show your evidence for that assertion!
Ryunosuke:
...Very well.
Kazuma:
...!
Stronghart:
In that case, Counsel for the Defence, present your evidence to the court now. Evidence that substantiates your claim that the victim was investigating the SS Grouse on 31st October.
Present Passport
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"What's this?"
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
It's proven...by this evidence here!
Stronghart:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Yes, this evidence proves it...I think...
Stronghart:
.........
Ryunosuke:
The, the proof is in the pudding?
Stronghart:
Those three equally nonsensical statements wasted fifteen seconds of the court's time. You will accordingly suffer fifteen seconds' worth of penalty, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (I need to work on picking a more succinct turn of phrase.)
Susato:
I think you might need to work on picking a more appropriate piece of evidence first.
Ryunosuke:
(I'm sure Gregson was on board that ship the day before his body was found. And we know the SS Grouse stopped at the Port of Dunkirk in France for the night...)
Stronghart:
I take it from your expression that you intend to risk further penalty.
Leads back to:
"In that case, Counsel for the Defence, present your evidence to the court now."
Stronghart:
What's this? A passport for travel issued to the victim?
Kazuma:
.........
Stronghart:
Dated 31st October? ...What are you suggesting?
Ryunosuke:
I'm suggesting that just one day before the inspector's body was discovered... ...there's a distinct possibility he wasn't even in the country!
Kazuma:
...!
Stronghart:
Order! Order! This document is for passage to France. It does appear to have been officially authorised.
Ryunosuke:
The day before the SS Grouse arrived at Dover... ...it docked on the northern coast of France for a night.
Susato:
According to my father, who was on board...at the Port of Dunkirk.
Stronghart:
Dunkirk, France... What could possibly have taken the victim there?
Kazuma:
......... Ha ha ha ha ha hah! I'm impressed, Ryunosuke Naruhodo! I certainly didn't expect you to get your hands on that passport.
Ryunosuke:
What? You mean...you knew about this?!
Kazuma:
......... The prosecution's strategy for this trial has been laid down by the Crown prosecution office: 'On the day before the incident, the victim was investigating contraband dealings at a London club.' That's the outcome of Scotland Yard's investigations and the line the prosecution has been asked to follow. ...But personally, I don't agree. I think the Prosecutor's Office is trying to hide something.
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Kazuma:
And now that you've expertly disproven their assertion... I intend to reveal what I believe that something to be.
Stronghart:
...What are you playing at, Prosecutor Asogi?
Kazuma:
A courtroom is a forum for the truth, My Lord. Which is why it's my duty to present all the facts, without exception.
Stronghart:
Let me guess... This was your intention from the outset, wasn't it?
Kazuma:
The reason Inspector Gregson secretly made his way to the steamship docked in France on the day in question... ...was to carry out a mission...for the Reaper!
Ryunosuke:
The, the Reaper?!
Stronghart:
Order! Order! What on earth are you saying, Counsel?
Kazuma:
The prosecution made an assertion in court yesterday:
Kazuma:
Inspector Gregson was investigating the identity of the Reaper. When he discovered the location of the man's secret hideout...he was killed. As I'm sure everyone can imagine...by the Reaper's hand!
Kazuma:
But in reality...the truth is the opposite of that.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Kazuma:
Inspector Gregson wasn't investigating the Reaper at all. He was in fact...acting FOR the Reaper!
Ryunosuke:
So...you're saying the mission he was undertaking was...
Kazuma:
Obviously...an assassination.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
Barok van Zieks never carried out any of the actual killings. Whenever the Reaper's victims lost their lives, he always had a cast-iron alibi. Which tells us...that he must have had an accomplice.
Stronghart:
And you claim...that was Inspector Gregson?
???:
Hold it!
Gina:
W...Wot the 'ell d'ya think yer sayin', eh? My boss would never o' done nuffin' like that!
Kazuma:
And yet...when you consider all the facts, it all makes perfect sense.
Gina:
No! It, it can't be...
Susato:
We also arrived at the same conclusion, didn't we? That Inspector Gregson was operating as the Reaper.
Ryunosuke:
Even so...there's no way that the person giving him his orders... ...was Lord van Zieks! (No, the true Reaper is somebody else...) Barok van Zieks is not the Reaper!
Kazuma:
A predictable response...from someone who's advocating for the man.
Ryunosuke:
And even if it's true that Gregson was operating as an agent of the Reaper... ...the suggestion that he went aboard the SS Grouse on an assassination mission doesn't follow at all.
Stronghart:
Oh? You have some solid reason for doubting the assertion, do you, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Absolutely. It's very simple. On the day in question... ...nobody was killed aboard that steamship.
Stronghart:
Hm...
Ryunosuke:
(Professor Mikotoba and Judge Jigoku were on that very ship. If someone had been assassinated, I'm certain we would have heard about it!)
Kazuma:
...Pfft!
Ryunosuke:
What's so funny?
Kazuma:
You're right, of course. No suspicious deaths were reported on board the ship. But I think perhaps you've missed the point. That's precisely why Inspector Gregson himself lost his life!
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Kazuma:
Gregson did board the SS Grouse that night, with the intention of dispatching his mark. But his mission...ended in failure.
Ryunosuke:
Failure...?
Kazuma:
It seems that the defence hasn't yet grasped a very important detail here.
Ryunosuke:
What are you talking about? (What detail?)
Kazuma:
Inspector Gina Lestrade!
Gina:
Eh?! Wot?
Kazuma:
The victim's notebook that you read an excerpt from earlier... That doesn't contain details of secret investigations at all. It describes ten years of assassination plots to be carried out by the Reaper of the Bailey.
Gina:
Yer lyin'! Even if all them bludgers wot got taken out 'ad it comin'... ...the boss weren't the Reaper!
Susato:
Poor Gina...
Kazuma:
There's no question that Tobias Gregson was heavily involved in the Reaper's activities. You may just be an apprentice, but if you've spent any time at Scotland Yard, you must have heard rumours...
Gina:
I ain't 'eard nuffin'! An' I don't believe a word of it!
Kazuma:
Then testify again. As a representative of Scotland Yard. Consider it...your chance to defend your 'boss'.
Gina:
I, I don't...
Stronghart:
I concur. The witness will give a new formal testimony. Miss Lestrade, you will tell the court everything you know about Inspector Gregson's secret notebook!
Gina:
.........
Witness Testimony
- The Reaper's Notebook -
Gina:
Yeah, this notebook does 'ave a load o' stuff about wot the Reaper got up to these past ten years.
Names o' victims, dates an' places an' stuff... An' the last entry in there was 31st October.
It said 'Grouse' for the place on that date, and then the name o' the mark.
There was a note about 'im bein' a criminal wot got away from the Reaper in court ten years ago or summat.
But honest! The boss didn't do none of it! 'E was... 'E was just investigatin' the Reaper, that's all!
Stronghart:
Keep personal opinion out of your testimony, witness. We require only established fact here.
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(This must be so hard for her.)
Kazuma:
You can't deny it now, surely...Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
What can't I deny?
Kazuma:
The notebook contained the name of the final mark and the location where the assassination would take place. That's information that the victim could only have known if he was working with the Reaper!
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Stronghart:
So...who was to be this 'final mark'?
Kazuma:
Go ahead, Inspector Lestrade! Read the name for the court. The name that's written alongside the entry that mentions 'The Grouse' on 31st October.
Gina:
Eh? Oh, um... 'Ow d'you read this then...?
Ryunosuke:
(Reading's still not her strong suit...)
Gina:
That ain't the problem, alright, 'Oddo! It's a funny name. It ain't English. It's 'ard to read.
Ryunosuke:
So it's someone from overseas?
Gina:
Let me 'ave a bash at it. 'Seh...ish...iro...' is it? Yeah, 'Seishiro... ...Jig...ok...you...' maybe?
Ryunosuke:
Wha...? (It, it can't be...) Seishiro Jigoku?
Susato:
But that's...Judge Jigoku!
Stronghart:
Seishiro Jigoku... Certainly not an English name, you're right.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But that can't be right! I know Judge Jigoku! And I saw him the day before yesterday! Here in London! So I know for a fact that the man hasn't been assassinated!
Kazuma:
As I said...the Reaper failed.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Kazuma:
Gregson missed his chance to kill his mark and returned to British shores. But the Reaper wouldn't tolerate the mistake. So he killed the inspector...personally.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
The Reaper of course being the accused...Barok van Zieks!
Stronghart:
It's...an undeniably logical argument.
Ryunosuke:
(Kazuma... You planned for the trial to go this way all along, didn't you?)
???:
Van Zieks:
...Pray forgive the discourtesy of filling my hallowed chalice whilst I stand accused of murder.
Ryunosuke:
L-Lord van Zieks!
Kazuma:
The accused has no right to speak uninvited in court. You will return to the dock.
Van Zieks:
I say nothing of whether or not I'm the Reaper. That's the task of this court to decide. But there is one thing I can say unequivocally: That girl is no detective.
Gina:
Eh? Wha...? Nah, that's right, I ain't. I'm an inspector!
Van Zieks:
Repeating rumours heard around the Yard... Reading entries from a notebook of unconfirmed origin... That's not testimony. It's practically a script. No doubt the rest of this trial will go exactly as you've clearly planned.
Kazuma:
.........
Van Zieks:
Your hatred of me is understandable. In your mind, I'm sure I am the Reaper...who sent your father to the gallows all those years ago.
Kazuma:
...!
Van Zieks:
But you're in danger of becoming a far more sinister Reaper yourself... ...by attempting to have me condemned with this feeble excuse for testimony.
Kazuma:
What did you say?
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, this is our chance!
Ryunosuke:
My Lord! The defence requests that the defendant be allowed to speak! He may be privy to important information relating to the testimony just given by the witness!
Stronghart:
......... Very well. I'll make an exception and grant the request. The defendant may remain in the witness stand for the cross-examination.
Van Zieks:
Then allow me to toast the court's impartiality.
Stronghart:
...Don't raise your glass in my direction, sir. Counsel for the Defence, begin the cross-examination immediately!
Ryunosuke:
At once, My Lord!
Cross-Examination
- The Reaper's Notebook -
Gina:
Yeah, this notebook does 'ave a load o' stuff about wot the Reaper got up to these past ten years.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
In other words, it shows that Gregson was basically acting as the Reaper...
Gina:
Not you an' all! That ain't the only explanation, is it? 'E could 'ave been investigatin' the Reaper in secret and that notebook said wot 'e found out!
Van Zieks:
If I may... When originally people began referring to me as the Reaper, I didn't object. I believed the power to intimidate London's criminal classes into compliance with the law to be beneficial.
Ryunosuke:
But you carried out your own investigations into the true identity of the Reaper, didn't you?
Van Zieks:
Yes. And those investigations proved conclusively that Gregson was one arm of the Reaper.
Gina:
One arm? Wot are you on about?
Van Zieks:
The Reaper's victims were all extremely shrewd criminals at the top of their game. There's simply no way one person could have taken them on alone. The 'Reaper'...is an organisation.
Kazuma:
With you at its head?
Van Zieks:
......... I had spies at the Yard keeping me abreast of Gregson's movements, letting me know when he was elsewhere. So I'd been able to check the most recent entry in his book. I knew the location.
Ryunosuke:
You knew it said 'Grouse'?!
Van Zieks:
Believing it to be a reference to the gentleman's club, I went there on the day in question to investigate. Alone.
Susato:
Ah, so that explains why several members of the club claimed to have seen you there.
Van Zieks:
But of course the inspector was not there.
Kazuma:
Because at the time he was making his way to the steamship docked on the northern coast of France. As shown by the passport found in the victim's metal trunk.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
Very well then. Back to your testimony about the contents of this notebook...
Gina:
Fine...
Susato:
Is something wrong, Mr Naruhodo? You seemed a little shocked by something a moment ago.
Ryunosuke:
Oh... No, it's...it's alright. (I'm overthinking this, aren't I?)
If second, third, and fourth statements have been pressed
???:
Objection!
Gina:
Right, I've 'ad just about enough o' this!
Ryunosuke:

Gina:

Ryunosuke:

Stronghart:
That outburst was an insult to the court and to your own testimony. I might have known that a common pickpocket from the back slums couldn't make a detective.
Gina:
...!
Stronghart:
When this trial is over, you will forfeit your warrant card, Miss Lestrade. Is that clear?
Gina:
Uh...uhhh... I've 'ad it wiv the lot o' ya! It's lies every bleedin' place ya look in this world, innit? Well I've 'ad enough!
Susato:
Gina...
Ryunosuke:
So have I. After that little speech of Gina's, I've made up my mind...
Susato:
To do what, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
There was one point in this cross-examination... ...when something that was said just didn't sit right with me. One statement that seemed odd.
Susato:
Oh! Do, do you mean...?
Ryunosuke:
(I'm not going to let Gina's plea for help fall on deaf ears.)

Ryunosuke:

Ryunosuke:
Names of victims, dates, places and 'stuff'? What in particular?
Gina:
Well, beside the victims' names, this other name kept croppin' up.
Ryunosuke:
What other name was that?
Gina:
It's the one I told ya yesterday. The same name, written over an' over again.
Ryunosuke:
You mean...Asa Shinn?
Gina:
Yeah, that's the one! She's a friend o' yours or summat, isn't she?
Ryunosuke:
Were you even listening yesterday?
Van Zieks:
Asa Shinn... ...The assassin.
Gina:
Wot?! Like...a killer, you mean?
Van Zieks:
Gregson was the tactician - the one who came up with the plan of attack. He investigated the marks thoroughly, finding out when they would be vulnerable, and who to use to get at them.
Stronghart:
But the person actually executing his plans was someone else, you're saying. If that's true...then the 'Reaper' does indeed start to sound like an organised group of vigilantes.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Then perhaps what it said on the passport document... 'Permission for the applicant and one additional person to travel'. Could that additional person have been...?
Kazuma:
Clearly the assassin, who was meant to take Seishiro Jigoku's life.
Ryunosuke:
Gina! Can you confirm that?! Against the final entry that listed 'Grouse' and 'Seishiro Jigoku'... ...what name was written?
Gina:
Oh! Well...that's the only entry that didn't 'ave a name next to it, as it 'appens.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Gina:
It, it just 'ad like a question mark or summat there, I think.
Stronghart:
In other words, Gregson himself didn't know the identity of the assassin in that case.
Van Zieks:
But...Gregson was the one making the plans, was he not?
Susato:
Oh...how infuriating!
Ryunosuke:

And you're saying that the mark listed was Seishiro Jigoku?
Gina:
That's wot it said. Funny name, if you ask me. An' I thought your name was odd!
Ryunosuke:
So pleased to have lost my crown there...
Kazuma:
Mr Jigoku is the presiding judge of Japan's Supreme Court of Judicature.
Stronghart:
I remember the man. He came to our country as a visiting student sixteen years ago.
Van Zieks:
Studying international law and diplomacy under your tutelage, Lord Stronghart.
Stronghart:
That bearded young fellow was a very able man, I must say.
Ryunosuke:
(So Lord Stronghart was Judge Jigoku's mentor...)
Stronghart:
If I'm not mistaken, he returned to Japan ten years ago now.
Susato:
Ten years ago...after that fateful case...
Stronghart:
...Precisely. In the aftermath of the Professor case, his repatriation was organised immediately.
Kazuma:
.........
Stronghart:
It's a mystery why such a man would be listed in the inspector's notebook.
Gina:
I didn't think it was possible, but the mood in 'ere's got even worse now. Maybe I'll just keep talkin'...

Oh, do you remember what Father told us? That Judge Jigoku did once appear in court here in Britain. It was related to the Professor case, I'm sure!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course! You're right!
Mikotoba:
Seishiro was trying to mitigate Genshin's guilt, so he took to the stand to testify. But he...got a little carried away and, um...actually managed to break the witness stand. He also said some contemptuous words about the British Empire...for which he was charged.
Van Zieks:
......... It was a pitiful situation, yes. I'd forgotten all about it. But I prosecuted that trial too, as it happens.
Ryunosuke:
You did?!
Van Zieks:
It was considered to be an adjunct to the Professor proceedings, you see. But he was acquitted after being told to make reparation for the damage caused to the stand.
Kazuma:
And there you have it.
Van Zieks:
Have what?
Kazuma:
Surely the accused hasn't forgotten his own rule? That there's no saving anyone who faces the Reaper in court...guilty or innocent alike.
Ryunosuke:
Wha...? Noooooo! Are, are you suggesting that the reason Judge Jigoku was targeted for assassination...
Kazuma:
The man was sent back to Japan immediately after that trial. The Reaper had no time to do his work. But then - ten years later - the mark returns to Britain once more. Perhaps now you start to see...just how vindictive the Reaper is.
Ryunosuke:
Come on, that's absurd! To take someone's life for that?
Kazuma:
Isn't the whole premise of the Reaper absurd, killing those who have been found innocent? Clearly the rules by which the man operates...are beyond a sane person's comprehension!

Van Zieks:
......... Every single person killed by the Reaper was a criminal of the first order. Lowlifes like that have no compunction about robbing hundreds of others of their futures.
Gina:
Eh?
Van Zieks:
Their ludicrous acquittals in court give them the freedom to make hundreds more suffer.
Gina:

It's this! This is the proof that the apprentice detective's earlier statement is flawed!

Uuugh... (I'd better listen very carefully to the testimony again...)
Leads back to cross-examination
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
(There was definitely something strange about it that didn't add up.) The inconsistency...is in a statement made by this person!
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
People can only be inconsistent in what they say if they actually testify. But in case you hadn't noticed...the person you're accusing isn't even in the stand!
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Stronghart:
The defence appears unable to respond to that replication. Any further obviously deliberate obstructions to these proceedings will not be tolerated, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
No! Wait! (That's not strictly true, is it? A person doesn't necessarily have to be in the stand to say something that doesn't add up in court.)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, I'm quite sure... ...that you're just a step away from the right answer!
Ryunosuke:
(I just need to listen carefully to what people are saying again...)
Leads back to cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
(So that's what we have to work with...)
Susato:
It may help us that Lord van Zieks is in the stand, too.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, perhaps. I'm sure Gina knows nothing she hasn't already told us. There's no point trying to get more out of her.
Susato:
...Did you notice how Kazuma-sama reacted to Lord van Zieks's words?
Ryunosuke:
When he called him an even more sinister Reaper, you mean? Well, I'm sure Kazuma intends to eliminate any shred of doubt that the man is guilty. He's looking for revenge against the person he considers to be his father's killer, after all.
Susato:
I do worry that if we fail to find a discrepancy in this testimony somewhere... ...the trial may end and adjudication won't go in our favour. Let's listen carefully again to what everybody is saying...
Ryunosuke:
By you...Kazuma Asogi.
Kazuma:
Me?
Stronghart:
Is this some attempt at filibustering, Counsel? Prosecutor Asogi has given no testimony.
Kazuma:
What are you suggesting I said that was inconsistent?
Ryunosuke:
You let something slip that you shouldn't have. When I present the relevant piece of evidence, I imagine you'll realise what you've done.
Stronghart:
Very well then, Counsel, go ahead. What evidence reveals this alleged inconsistency in something Prosecutor Asogi has said?
Present Gregson's Trunk
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"This...is a trunk that belonged to Inspector Gregson."
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Stronghart:
......... So...my initial impressions were correct. This is nonsense.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Kazuma:
You accuse your best friend and back it up with that? Clearly...the Ryunosuke Naruhodo I knew is dead!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...struck down by my best friend...)
Susato:
I believe what you intended to point out, Mr Naruhodo, was when Kazuma said...
Kazuma:
Because at the time he was making his way to the steamship docked on the northern coast of France. As shown by the passport found in the victim's metal trunk.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's exactly it.
Stronghart:
...I take it from your expression that you're not going to let this go.
Ryunosuke:
Correct, My Lord. I made a mistake, that's all.
Leads back to:
"What are you suggesting I said that was inconsistent?"
Ryunosuke:
This...is a trunk that belonged to Inspector Gregson.
Stronghart:
A metal construction, is it? It's certainly very heavy. ...! What's this? A bloodstain? And a relatively fresh one, too.
Kazuma:
...!
Gina:
Wot?! You, you mean that ain't grease from all the boss's fish an' chips?!
Van Zieks:
Fresh blood on the inspector's trunk... That suggests that the victim was travelling with that luggage when he was killed.
Stronghart:
That can't be. There was no mention of any trunk in Scotland Yard's report.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, there's a reason for that. Immediately after the inspector's body was discovered, one of the street pedlars made off with the trunk... ...hoping to sell it.
Gina:
But I found it! Me, wiv me nose for trouble!
Stronghart:
Hmph...
Ryunosuke:
Which means that nobody should have known anything about the trunk. Unless of course...we're talking about somebody who was present when the victim was killed.
Kazuma:
.........
Ryunosuke:
And yet...during the cross-examination of the witness just now, you said this, Kazuma:
Kazuma:
Because at the time he was making his way to the steamship docked on the northern coast of France. As shown by the passport found in the victim's metal trunk.
Ryunosuke:
So the question is...how did you know about the inspector's trunk?
Kazuma:
......... We know the man went on a trip to France. Where else would he have put his passport?
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But you knew it was a metal trunk! Answer me honestly, Kazuma! On 31st October...where exactly were you?!
Kazuma:
......... At the Port of Dunkirk, on board the SS Grouse... Is that the answer you're looking for, Ryunosuke?
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma! What did you...?! (I hadn't considered the possibility before, but... ...if Kazuma was there on the ship, then...it can only have been for one purpose...)
Susato:
Oh no, Mr Naruhodo! Surely...surely you don't think...?
Kazuma:
Ha ha ha ha hah! Come on, Ryunosuke, you know the rules. The only thing that really talks in the courtroom is hard evidence.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
As I understand it, Inspector Gregson always took that case with him when he travelled. So as it stands...you've proved nothing.
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma... ...are you challenging me to prove it, beyond all reasonable doubt? That you were there that day...in the same place as the inspector!
Van Zieks:
He, he was there? With Gregson?
Ryunosuke:
There's a clue that you've overlooked! A secret that trunk can tell us. (I can't be sure at this point. I'll need to verify it. But I have a nasty feeling...that I'm going to be right.)
Stronghart:
The accusation being made is deeply disturbing. But nevertheless...we must test it. The defence will identify for the court where in the trunk this alleged clue is to be found. Where is the evidence that ties Prosecutor Asogi to Inspector Gregson?
Examine latch, then piece of paper
Ryunosuke:
31st October... So this passport is for the day before Gregson's body was found. He needed this document for his trip to France. And when it says 'permission for the applicant and one additional person to travel'... (...I can't believe it was you, Kazuma...)
Examine latch, then present metal fragment on side
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"There's a small piece of metal lodged in the wall of the trunk here. Like the tip of a blade."
Present anywhere else
Ryunosuke:
Stronghart:
This is your proof? What do you say to that, Prosecutor Asogi?
Kazuma:
Personally... ...I think tying the defence counsel to the inspector's trunk and tossing it into the sea would be more helpful.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Kazuma:
At least that way, London's courtrooms will be safe from his destructive accusations.
Susato:
I believe that was a rather long-winded way of telling you that you're wrong, Mr Naruhodo.
Stronghart:
Very well. Then let us see if you sink or swim under the weight of this penalty, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAAGH!
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! You can't allow yourself to be drowned at sea yet!
Ryunosuke:
I...was hoping never to let that happen, funnily enough.
Leads back to:
"The defence will identify for the court where in the trunk this alleged clue is to be found."
Ryunosuke:
There's a small piece of metal lodged in the wall of the trunk here. Like the tip of a blade.
Gina:
Eh? A blade?
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma, slung around your waist as ever today... ...is the esteemed blade Karuma!
Kazuma:
Of course it is.
Ryunosuke:
Won't you draw it? Here in this courtroom...for all to see.
Kazuma:
.........
Van Zieks:
Exercise caution, my learned friend. That man is the son of London's most notorious killer.
Stronghart:
Bailiff! Watch Prosecutor Asogi like a hawk!
Kazuma:
...That won't be necessary.
Susato:
Oh no!
Ryunosuke:
The tip...is broken...
Van Zieks:
...!
Ryunosuke:
If the fragment of metal from the trunk fits together with the end of the sword... ...the question of who was there with Inspector Gregson will be answered. Agreed...Kazuma Asogi?!
Kazuma:
Expertly done, Ryunosuke! That's a point to you, and well deserved.
Stronghart:
Do you mean to tell the court, Prosecutor Asogi...?
Examine evidence
Gregson's Trunk
Latch, then metal fragment on side
Ryunosuke:
The tip of Karuma... So this is how it was broken. Kazuma's swordsmanship is second to none. I can't believe he'd misjudge it like that.
Susato:
Clearly he wasn't in his right mind. He didn't have full control of the power in his stroke. Too distracted by malicious thoughts, perhaps...
Ryunosuke:
Well, that wouldn't be surprising. After all... ...he was on an assassination mission.
Susato:
...!
Kazuma:
Yes, on 31st October, I accompanied Inspector Gregson to Dunkirk... ...in order to carry out a mission.
Ryunosuke:
So the 'additional person' authorised to travel...
Kazuma:
...Was me.
Stronghart:
And the mission was...?
Kazuma:
...The assassination of the mark.
Ryunosuke:
Wha... WHAAAAAAT?! You mean...you're the killer whose name was omitted from this notebook?! You were following the Reaper's orders...to dispatch Judge Jigoku...?
Kazuma:
......... Let me make one thing perfectly clear: I have killed no one.
Stronghart:
Explain.
Kazuma:
I accepted the assassination mission, yes. And I accompanied Gregson to Dunkirk. But I never had any intention of carrying out the plan.
Ryunosuke:
You were never going to do it...?
Susato:
...We can believe Kazuma-sama, I'm sure. After all, Judge Jigoku arrived safely in London the following day.
Stronghart:
Hmmm...
Kazuma:
On the 31st, I boarded a train from London with Inspector Gregson. We travelled to Dover, from where we crossed the Channel to Dunkirk. Then we boarded the SS Grouse and made for the cabin deck - as indicated in the plan.
Susato:
You went to Judge Jigoku's cabin?
Kazuma:
Exactly. He wasn't there, though. We decided to wait, but...
Ryunosuke:
But you've already told us you had no intention of going through with it anyway.
Kazuma:
I didn't come to Great Britain to take anyone's life. So I left Gregson and disembarked the ship. I spent that night at a boarding house in the town, and returned to England the following morning.
Ryunosuke:
A boarding house...in Dunkirk?
Kazuma:
My signature will be in the register book. It would be simple enough to verify.
Stronghart:
Then what became of Jigoku?
Kazuma:
Gregson was no assassin. So the mark was spared. I'm sure it's easy enough to imagine what happened after that. Gregson returned to England as well, having failed to complete the mission. He met with the Reaper in that room on Fresno Street to report the failure... ...causing the infuriated mastermind to pull the trigger... ...and end his wretched agent's life. That's the real truth behind Inspector Gregson's murder!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
But if you did nothing as you claim... ...how did the tip of your sword come to be lodged in the inspector's trunk?
Kazuma:
......... I don't need to answer that.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
The victim was killed by a gunshot. A small fragment of a Japanese blade isn't relevant to the case. And accordingly...I choose to exercise my right to silence on that matter.
Van Zieks:
.........
Stronghart:
Be that as it may, the court will sequester the sword as evidence.
Kazuma:
......... As you wish, My Lord.
The great sword 'Karuma' has been entered into the Court Record.
Stronghart:
We must take immediate action now... ...to verify whether Seishiro Jigoku remains unharmed.
Examine evidence
Great Sword 'Karuma'
Sheath
Ryunosuke:
Karuma, the great blade... It's such a thing of beauty, I want to gaze on it for hours.
Tip of blade
Ryunosuke:
The tip of the great sword...broken... It's such a shame. It's been so meticulously cared for over the years. I can almost hear Karuma's sobs...
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Kazuma must have really taken a swing for that to happen...)
Ryunosuke:
What?! R-Remains unharmed?
Kazuma:
I agree. That should be our first priority. It's recently come to my attention that he hasn't been seen since yesterday.
Ryunosuke:
...! H-How did you...?
Kazuma:
When a foreign dignitary invited to Great Britain goes missing for twenty-four hours... ...it's only natural that the question of his safety should arise.
Ryunosuke:
You don't mean to say... ...that you think Judge Jigoku may have been killed?!
Kazuma:
The Reaper has more than one assassin at his disposal. And he has the power and influence to give orders from the inside of a prison cell. Isn't that right...Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
...If I were truly the Reaper, I'd be able to tell you.
Stronghart:
Order! Order in court! Order! We will take an emergency recess for thirty minutes.
Ryunosuke:
Now?
Stronghart:
Guests of the symposium have been told to maintain regular contact with the organiser's office. If the man can't be located within half an hour... ...we will have to assume the worst.
Susato:
Oh no! Not Judge Jigoku!
Kazuma:
No one would want to kill a harmless Japanese man who'd only just arrived in the country. Except, that is... ...for the Reaper, wanting to finish off a mark that slipped through the net ten years ago.
Stronghart:
I would have to agree. Mr Naruhodo, for the defence's sake...
Ryunosuke:
M-My Lord?
Stronghart:
...I sincerely hope we are successful. If we're unable to confirm Mr Jigoku's healthy existence in the next thirty minutes, you will face grave difficulties.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Stronghart:
Court is adjourned for thirty minutes!
Susato:
Kazuma-sama, the Reaper's assassin... I feel as though I'm in a nightmare.
Ryunosuke:
I can hardly believe it either. But on the other hand... ...Kazuma isn't in the habit of making up stories.
Susato:
......... I have such a terrible sense of foreboding. If something awful has happened to Judge Jigoku... ...then I feel as though things will only spiral further and further out of control.
Ryunosuke:
(I felt it from the moment I stepped into the courthouse this morning. That strange sensation that we were careering towards a foregone conclusion...) Well, in the worst case, we might only have thirty minutes left. Unfortunately though, I don't think there's anything we can do but wait now. We're out of options.
Susato:
......... Actually, there may be one last hand we can play. Or rather...one last ear.
Ryunosuke:
Of course! The little Mr Sholmes doll that Iris gave us!
Iris:
If for some reason you completely run out of options in the trial today... ...then just pull this little Hurley's ears as hard as you possibly can!
Ryunosuke:
(Perhaps now is the time. What should I do? Pull Hareley's ears or not...)
Pull!
Leads to:
"Here goes then. I'm going to do it!"
Leave it
Ryunosuke:
(This is one of Iris's inventions... There's no telling what might happen. For all I know, it could cause a huge explosion!)
Susato:
I'm not sure you should be thinking like that, Mr Naruhodo. Compared to the trial ending immediately after this recess, a huge explosion might be preferable!
Ryunosuke:
I'm not sure you should be thinking like that, Miss Susato. But I suppose you're right. If there was ever a time for taking a risk, it's now!
Leads to:
"Here goes then. I'm going to do it!"
Ryunosuke:
Here goes then. I'm going to do it!
Susato:
Good luck, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
No looking back... HEEEAVE!!!
???:
OOOOOOOOOOOOW!
Susato:
That scream...sounded like Mr Sholmes!
Ryunosuke:
M-Mr Sholmes?! ...Where are you?
Sholmes:
Here, my dear fellow! Here!
Ryunosuke:
It's...it's the felt doll talking!
Susato:
Pull the ears again, Mr Naruhodo! As hard as you can!
Ryunosuke:
Alright then. I'll put all my strength into it. HEEEEEEAVE!
Sholmes:
OOOOOOOOOOOOW! Please, my dear fellows! You don't need to pull my ear off!
Susato:
Mr Sholmes! Where, where are you?
Sholmes:
Myself and my trusty partner... ...are presently in the first-class cabin area of the SS Grouse.
Ryunosuke:
The, the SS Grouse?
Sholmes:
She left Dover last night, after the final pieces of cargo were loaded. We are currently docked at Dunkirk, but due to be underway again in half an hour.
Ryunosuke:
You've...taken a ship to France?!
Sholmes:
Please, even with my athletic prowess, I would struggle to jump the Straits of Dover. After we left Baker Street last night, we hurried by cab to the station and by train to the port... ...in order to board this vessel in time.
Ryunosuke:
So...you mean...you'd already worked it out? That the steamship was where everything really took place!
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo...pray, what is my name?
Ryunosuke:
Herlock Sholmes...world-famous great detective!
Sholmes:
Recited to perfection. Well done.
Susato:
You're a genius, Mr Sholmes! That's the only word for it!
Sholmes:
Ow ow ow ow ow! M-Miss Susato! Gently with this genius's ear, please!
Susato:
Oh my! I'm ever so sorry!
???:
If I may, Sholmes...?
Sholmes:
Ah, there you are, Mikotoba.
Mikotoba:
You may remember that it was in fact I who made the connection to the SS Grouse. At Scotland Yard yesterday, when we examined that notebook and I recalled my steamship ticket.
Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! But of course it was, my dear fellow! And not once did I controvert that fact. I merely had our court-bound companions utter my name.
Mikotoba:
......... Yes, you did, didn't you?
Ryunosuke:
We've just entered a recess. The trial resumes in thirty minutes from now.
Susato:
And if we're unable to present any new leads then, I'm afraid to say...
Sholmes:
Do not fret, please. It's for precisely that purpose that my partner and I have made this journey. I have no doubt we shall have welcome news for you within the half hour.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you, Mr Sholmes! That would be wonderful.
Sholmes:
Until later, then.
Ryunosuke:
Yes! You'll be hearing from us if you're not in touch first.
Sholmes:
Ow ow ow ow ow! I shan't be hearing anything if you keep tugging my ear in that mindless fashion!
Mikotoba:
Whatever was the idea behind making a receiver operated [sic] in that way in the first place, Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Why the deuce would I know?! It's Iris's invention, not mine.
Mikotoba:
Whilst I know how much you enjoy being the hero of the hour, Sholmes... ...we have but half that now before the Grouse puts to sea again. If we don't conclude our investigations rapidly, we shall find ourselves in Naples before long.
Sholmes:
Hm...there are times, Mikotoba, when you make a surprising amount of sense. So, let us begin!
Mikotoba:
'First-Class Cabin No. 2'... Yes, this is the one. But I don't believe an investigation of the cabin is going to be plain sailing. (That crewman standing in front of the door is an angry-looking fellow.)
???:
Why are you loitering here? Who are you?
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, do you not recognise a world-famous great detective when you see one? The question really ought to be, who are you?
???:
Do you not recognise world-travelling great sailor Tchikin Strogenov when you see?
Tchikin:
Great detective? Hah! I don't think so.
Sholmes:
......... Do you see that, Mikotoba? It would appear that this man is a devoted follower of mine.
Mikotoba:
Goodness me! Is, is that a tattoo? That says 'Sholmes'?!
Sholmes:
...I must say, whilst such adoration is flattering, naturally, it does leave me a little cold.
Tchikin:
What are you talking about? Leave! Now!
Sholmes:
How distressing. My loyal devotee knows me only by name and not by appearance. And yet I already know a great deal about you, sir. You have a brother, I believe. Like yourself, he's a shipman. Currently travelling the world aboard a Russian steamship, in fact.
Tchikin:
H-How could you know this?!
Sholmes:
Elementary, my dear Mikotoba.
Mikotoba:
...I'm sure it was. Three days ago, I was bound for London aboard this ship, you see. We're looking for one of my fellow passengers. A man by the name of Jigoku.
Tchikin:
There is no one with this name on board.
Mikotoba:
But we know that he purchased a ticket for passage.
Tchikin:
......... Ah, you mean Eastern man. He left ship two hours ago. Here at Dunkirk. He said something about emergency, I think.
Mikotoba:
What?! Are, are you sure? (So Seishiro's realised that we're after him, has he?)
Sholmes:
His cabin is the one behind you. We should like to investigate, please.
Tchikin:
No! I have orders not to let even mouse inside!
Sholmes:
......... Mikotoba, be a good man and draw this sailor's attention away, would you? Make up some excuse so that he leaves the area.
Tchikin:
......... Doesn't great detective see...? That even sailors have ears. Both left and right.
Sholmes:
......... Curses! The plan is ruined!
Mikotoba:
...And you have only yourself to blame, I'm afraid, Sholmes.
Tchikin:
Forget it. Cabin door is locked. Even if I am not here, you cannot get inside.
Sholmes:
......... Mikotoba... ...I'm sure you haven't forgotten my 'special talent' have you?
Mikotoba:
...! (Opening any lock?)
Sholmes:
...Within a mere five seconds. So if you'd be so kind as to afford me the requisite time, old friend, in your typically accommodating manner.
Mikotoba:
How could I refuse such a typically unappealing request, old friend? (So I need to distract that burly sailor for five seconds, do I?)
Sholmes:
Good man! So...the game is afoot!
Examine
Cabin door on left
Mikotoba:
That's another first-class cabin, and yet its door is completely unguarded.
Sholmes:
Empty as well. I had a quick look inside earlier. Though I confess, I didn't investigate the wardrobe. There may very well be a young Japanese fellow inside, perspiring merrily.
Mikotoba:
If you're referring to Naruhodo, you know very well that he's currently perspiring merrily in court.
Sholmes:
Does it not strike you though, Mikotoba? Why the man stands guard only in front of this cabin, when both are apparently vacant...
Alarm
Mikotoba:
This would appear to be an alarm bell. (All hell would break loose if that thing were to ring. The whole crew would know about it.)
Set it off
Leads to:
"Here goes, then. Pardon me in advance!"
Leave it alone
Mikotoba:
(No, I think not. That would never work, surely...) I need to concoct another distraction...
Mousetrap
Mikotoba:
This must be a mousetrap, I think. (Perhaps I could distract the crewman's attention with this somehow...)
Try it
...*Snap!*
Mikotoba:
Chuuuuuu, chuuuuuu!
Tchikin:
......... That sounds like big mouse in trap.
Mikotoba:
Chuuuuuu, chuuuuuu!
Tchikin:
I will bring bucket of water later and put out of misery.
Mikotoba:
......... (I don't like the sound of that.)
Sholmes:
In any case, my dear fellow, that was quite unconvincing. Only Japanese mice make a 'chu' sound.
Mikotoba:
Oh really, Sholmes? And pray tell, what sound do Russian mice make?
Sholmes:
'Pii pii' naturally. Though also quite unconvincing, I readily admit. So go ahead, Mikotoba. Do a 'pii pii' this time!
Mikotoba:
...No thank you. I'm sure I can come up with an alternative solution.
Leave it alone
Mikotoba:
(No, I think not. That would never work, surely...) I need to concoct another distraction...
Tchikin Strogenov
Mikotoba:
(He's like a Nioh temple guardian statue, this fellow, the way he's glaring at us so fiercely.) Tell me, why are you standing guard here if the cabin is unoccupied?
Tchikin:
Because this area is only for first-class passengers. We must look out for suspicious kriminals.
Mikotoba:
(He was looking straight at me when he said that.)
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, as you can plainly see, we are quite unsuspicious as criminals go.
Tchikin:
...But still kriminals.
Mikotoba:
No no no! For goodness' sake, Sholmes, tell the man! We're neither suspicious nor criminals!
Sholmes:
Ah yes! Quite right, Mikotoba. Curses! This seaman is far too able for his own good! ...Be extremely careful in what you say!
Mikotoba:
(One of us ought to be, yes.)
Light switch
Mikotoba:
Ah, the switch for the electrical lights. (Perhaps if I were to turn off the lights, the crewman wouldn't be able to see what we were doing...)
Flick the switch
...*Click*
Tchikin:
Agh! What is happening? Where is light?
Mikotoba:
Now, Sholmes! Now!
*Thud! Thump!*
*Click*
Tchikin:
Hmph. Nobody there...
Mikotoba:
(That was a close shave.)
Sholmes:
Quite a knack you have, stumbling so violently in an apparently empty corridor.
Mikotoba:
...Do be quiet, Sholmes. I shall have to think of another approach.
Leave it alone
Mikotoba:
(No, I think not. That would never work, surely...) I need to concoct another distraction...
Speaking tube
Mikotoba:
That's a speaking tube for members of the crew to communicate with one another around the ship. (If I could persuade our stocky sailor friend that he needed to use it... ...Sholmes could unlock the door whilst he was distracted.) The question is...how?
Door on right
Mikotoba:
(That's the way back to the deck. But we certainly can't give up on this now...)
Mikotoba:
(Here goes, then. Pardon me in advance!)
Ding-aling-aling-aling-aling-aling-aling...
Tchikin:
You! What are you doing? If we were at sea, that would be very bad problem!
???:
What's going on down there?! Seaman Strogenov! Report at once!
Tchikin:
...! Sorry, sir! Nothing to report! It was just stupid trick! ...No, not by me! By world-famous- No! As I told you...
Mikotoba:
Now, Sholmes! Now!
Sholmes:
...Done.
Mikotoba:
Not even five seconds, eh?
Sholmes:
Well don't stand there gawping at my brilliance, Mikotoba! In we go!
Mikotoba:
Oh! Yes...
3rd November
SS Grouse, First-Class Cabin No. 2
Mikotoba:
Good gracious...
Sholmes:
It would appear that the occupant of this cabin did indeed disembark rather hurriedly.
Mikotoba:
Those clothes on the floor there... They're Seishiro's, without question.
Sholmes:
Well, it seems we are just a little too late.
Mikotoba:
Yes, by about two hours.
Sholmes:
Still, whilst we're here, we should investigate thoroughly. There may well be two hours' worth of clues to find in here.
Mikotoba:
But that burly crewman may return at any moment, Sholmes.
Sholmes:
Indeed he may. ...Which makes this all the more thrilling!
Examine
Wardrobe
Mikotoba:
According to the report I was given, Naruhodo was concealing himself in Asogi's wardrobe.
Sholmes:
Indeed he was. And it was of a similar size to this one. Ah! You must climb inside yourself, my dear fellow!
Mikotoba:
What? Whatever for?
Sholmes:
It was the site of my first fateful meeting with Mr Naruhodo. You can experience the moment for yourself now! Complete with my dramatic rhetoric! Come along now! In you go! This will only take a moment.
Mikotoba:
Really, Sholmes, surely you can just tell me what you said!
Sholmes:
......... Well...I uttered some brilliant remark and opened the wardrobe to reveal the stowaway murderer!
Mikotoba:
...I think I'll just read about it in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes.'
Tray with glass
Sholmes:
Quite the exquisite glass, I must say. See here, how it.........
Mikotoba:
Is, is something wrong, Sholmes? You suddenly trailed off...
Sholmes:
Ice, Mikotoba, ice! What opulence the first-class passengers enjoy: chilled drinks.
Mikotoba:
Pardon?
Sholmes:
Could it be that this steamship is equipped with an electrically refrigerated cold room, do you think?
Mikotoba:
Well...it is a luxury liner, after all. They have enormous refrigerators for storing all sorts of lavish produce as well as ice. On our voyage from Japan, we enjoyed culinary delights from all over the world.
Sholmes:
......... Hm, suddenly, Mikotoba... ...the sight of you is making my mouth water.
Mikotoba:
......... I haven't taken on the flavour of the food I ate, you know.
Speaking tube
Mikotoba:
There's a speaking tube here, look. Though it's been stoppered with some cloth. So the voices of the crewmen on the bridge aren't an annoyance, I suppose.
Sholmes:
Or indeed so that the voices in this cabin aren't heard elsewhere.
Mikotoba:
...! Could something have happened in here that was for no one else's ears, do you think?
Sholmes:
Either that, or... ...it could be to prevent snakes from entering.
Mikotoba:
...That's really become a favourite case of yours, hasn't it?
Wastebasket
Mikotoba:
This is the wastepaper basket, look. ...And there's still rubbish inside.
Sholmes:
Indeed? Then let us pry... I've discovered recently I have a penchant for exploring the contents of others' wastepaper baskets.
Mikotoba:
I sincerely hope only for your work.
Sholmes:
......... Ah. Here we have a notice issued to passengers from three days ago.
Mikotoba:
Three days ago? The night before we arrived in London, then. When I was still aboard myself. Ah yes...there was an evacuation drill. I remember now. For our safety and security, all first-class passengers were constantly under the watchful eye of the crew. So it was a welcome relief to have some privacy for once.
The evacuation drill itinerary has been entered into the Court Record.
Wastebasket (subsequent times)
Mikotoba:
This is the wastepaper basket, look. ...And there's still rubbish inside.
Sholmes:
Indeed? Then let us pry... I've discovered recently I have a penchant for exploring the contents of others' wastepaper baskets.
Mikotoba:
I sincerely hope only for your work.
Sholmes:

For our safety and security, all first-class passengers were constantly under the watchful eye of the crew. So it was a welcome relief to have some privacy for once.
Pile of clothes
Sholmes:
That's a substantial heap of clothes on the floor. An overcoat, shirts, a dressing gown...
Mikotoba:
Momohiki work trousers, a tanzen robe, a haramaki waist band... Clearly the clothing of a Japanese man.
Sholmes:
And clearly, Japanese men are unaccustomed to the culture of the wardrobe.
Mikotoba:
It looks to me as if they've been thrown in a heap like that in something of a hurry.
Sholmes:
Indeed. You could help yourself to a Japanese man's shirt perhaps? I'm sure you made mention of packing too few.
Mikotoba:
I'd very likely drown in one of Seishiro's shirts. No, I'll just buy any extras I need, I think.
Large briefcase
Sholmes:
That's a very sizeable trunk indeed.
Mikotoba:
Seishiro is partial to all things large.
Sholmes:
And a rather clumsy fellow, if he failed to notice he'd left that behind.
Mikotoba:
Perhaps he left it on purpose. It's lighter than you might think, but still a hindrance to a speedy escape.
Sholmes:
...Hm, pity. It's locked, so we can't look inside.
Mikotoba:
Surely five seconds from now the situation will be quite different though?
Sholmes:
Sadly not. It has a seven-digit combination lock. And I'm not in a morose enough mood to work through all the combinations at present.
Sign on wall
Mikotoba:
These are the 'Rules of Passage'. 'Passengers must not keep weapons or other dangerous objects in their cabins. Pets are also strictly forbidden. Additionally, there are severe punishments for stowing away in wardrobes and/or travel cases.'
Sholmes:
I feel the rules have increased since I last read them. ...Probably just my imagination.
Mikotoba:
What about the fact that they're not straight on the wall? Doesn't that strike you?
Sholmes:
Hm, you may be right. ...Probably just your imagination, though. A trifle. And you know what I always say, Mikotoba: there is nothing important about trifles.
Mikotoba:
...It's probably just my imagination, but I think THAT might be slightly off.
Bookcase
Mikotoba:
Plenty of reading material to keep passengers occupied on the long sea voyages. I found the mixture of classic literature and easy reading to be most satisfactory, I must say.
Sholmes:
...Tsk! Whoever stocked this bookcase was a hopeless heretic. There's no copy of 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', my dear fellows!
Mikotoba:
Um...I'm afraid it's just me. But no, you're quite right. More blasphemous than overlooking the Bible.
Sholmes:
I shall leave a copy behind. I just happen to have one with me.
Mikotoba:
You're a true missionary of the Church of Great Detectives, aren't you?
Square mark on wall
Mikotoba:
The wall is a slightly different colour just here. Do you see?
Sholmes:
Indeed. What you have observed arises when a frame that has been hanging for some time is removed. ......... Perhaps your friend is an art thief.
Mikotoba:
Now there's a bold deduction worthy of a great detective, I'm sure.
Sholmes:
He may very well be the illusive thief who has been plaguing France's galleries of late.
Mikotoba:
...I think perhaps we should focus our attentions elsewhere, Sholmes, don't you? (That outline on the wall... I feel as though I might have spotted something of a similar shape and size elsewhere.)
Door
Mikotoba:
All the doors on this vessel have locks, I believe.
Sholmes:
A wise idea. You never know where and when criminals may strike. But of course, to the great detective Herlock Sholmes... ...lock, bolt or shirt button, it makes no difference. All are unfastened with equal ease!
Mikotoba:
The way you go on, you sound rather more like a great thief than a great detective.
Sholmes:
My dear Mikotoba, as long as there is greatness, I am quite satisfied.
Mikotoba:
Haah... Of course you are.
After examining tray with glass, wastebasket, large briefcase, and square mark on wall:
Tchikin:
You! You are still here?!
Mikotoba:
Ah, Able Seaman Strogenov. Hello again.
Sholmes:
...I was beginning to think you'd never materialise.
Tchikin:
Eh? You...you are waiting for me?
Sholmes:
Of course! I was expecting you to burst in with a hearty Russian profanity far sooner.
Tchikin:
I was in trouble with captain because of trick you play before!
Mikotoba:
(Poor, innocent Tchikin...)
Tchikin:
It is all your fault! Ship is leaving port soon. Get off! Now!
Sholmes:
Of course, we shall disembark presently, my dear fellow. But first... ...there is something that must be done.
Tchikin:
What are you talking about?
Sholmes:
Why naturally... ...the debunking of your deceit and the baring of the truth!
Tchikin:
Kakoy?!
Sholmes:
I'm afraid I see through your lies. For one thing... ...Mr Jigoku has not yet left this vessel at all.
Tchikin:
Ah!
Sholmes:
And for another, my dear Seaman Strogenov... ...you know exactly where the man is even as we speak, don't you?
Tchikin:
......... How, how can you...?
Mikotoba:
Good gracious, Sholmes! You mean...you've worked it out? All of it?!
Sholmes:
......... It's really been too long, hasn't it, old friend? Ten years, no less!
Mikotoba:
...!
Sholmes:
So...would you care to join me for a dance...of my inimitable logic and reasoning?
Mikotoba:
......... Nothing would please me more!
Tchikin:
W-What is this?
Sholmes:
We have but minutes until the vessel puts to sea. No games now.
Time is of the essence!
Mr Strogenov, allow me to remind you of your earlier claim: You told us that Jigoku left the ship some two hours ago.
Tchikin:
Da! That is what I said!
Sholmes:
Sadly, that was a rather clumsy lie. You see, there is something in this room that quite clearly contradicts it.
Tchikin:
What?!
Mikotoba:
Ah! (Yes, of course...)
Sholmes:
I see you've noted it too,  Mikotoba. Then please, do take the lead... What in this cabin shows the impossibility of Jigoku having disembarked two hours ago? Let's see what the last three years have done to your observational skills then, Mikotoba!
Mikotoba:
It's been ten years since we last did this, Sholmes, not three.
Sholmes:
Why, of course it has! Quite! Now, all the clues are here in this cabin for your eyes to see. But as I always say, you must not merely look, but observe. Observe and the answers become clear. So...impress me!
Mikotoba:
I think I can manage that!
Present glass containing ice
Mikotoba:
Leads to:
"Perhaps you should have cleared away that glass?"
Present anything else
Mikotoba:
Sholmes:
Mikotoba. 'No games now' were my words, were they not?
Mikotoba:
Hmph. Come, Sholmes, where's the fun in life without a little fooling around, hm?
Sholmes:
......... Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Quite right you are!
Mikotoba:
(That was a close shave. I'd better rethink that before I'm the fool here...)
Leads to:
"What in this cabin shows the impossibility of Jigoku having disembarked two hours ago?"
What in this cabin shows the impossibility of Jigoku having disembarked two hours ago?
Mikotoba:
Jigoku didn't disembark two hours ago at all. That was a lie, wasn't it?
Sholmes:
Of course it was. And I had hoped you would be quicker to point out why. Otherwise...the evidence itself may melt away before our every eyes!
Mikotoba:
Perhaps you should have cleared away that glass?
Sholmes:
How curious that the ice shouldn't have melted despite it being abandoned two hours ago?
Tchikin:
Ah!
Sholmes:
It would appear that the man was here in this very cabin until moments before our arrival... ...with this well-chilled glass in hand!
Mikotoba:
(Get your mind off the refreshments, Sholmes.)
Sholmes:
One might even conclude that somebody informed him of our boarding. Wouldn't you agree, Mr Strogenov?
Tchikin:
Errr...
Mikotoba:
But...why would Seishiro run from us?
Sholmes:
......... Before we consider that question, allow me to confirm one small matter: Would I be correct in saying that these first-class cabins of the SS Grouse... ...are the same ones in which you and Mr Jigoku were accommodated on your voyage from Japan?
Mikotoba:
Ah! That's...that's right, they are. I was in the cabin next door, and Seishiro was...yes... ...fifty days in this very cabin during our voyage!
Sholmes:
As I suspected. For you see... ...there are traces in this cabin of a dark secret that Mr Jigoku had to hide.
Mikotoba:
What traces?
Tchikin:
I, I know nothing about this!
Sholmes:
Ah, this is news to you, is it, Mr Strogenov?
Mikotoba:
Sholmes, what exactly are you getting at?
Sholmes:
As I said, there are traces in this cabin of some nefarious activity. Something that appears out of place, which I'm quite sure won't have escaped your notice.
Mikotoba:
(Something out of place in here...?)
Sholmes:
That's the key to this, Mikotoba. The remnants of the dark deed that took place in here are being masked by something quite incongruous! I must say, I didn't foresee ever doing this dance of deduction with you again, Mikotoba.
Mikotoba:
No, quite. But life is full of unexpected twists and turns, as we well know. Now then, let's see if I can't uncover the truth here...
Sholmes:
Yes, you have the floor, my dear fellow!
Present Rules of Passage
Mikotoba:
Leads to:
"It's the Rules of Passage in this frame here."
Present anything else
Mikotoba:
Sholmes:
Mikotoba. 'No games now' were my words, were they not?
Mikotoba:
Hmph. Come, Sholmes, where's the fun in life without a little fooling around, hm?
Sholmes:

Mikotoba:
(That was a close shave. I'd better rethink that before I'm the fool here...)
Leads to:
"The remnants of the dark deed that took place in here are being masked by something quite incongruous!"
The remnants of the dark deed that took place in here are being masked by something quite incongruous!
Sholmes:
You must tilt your head to one side and listen carefully to the faint cries of the scene. Hear the evidence calling out for you to find it. 'Here I am,' it cries!
Mikotoba:
Well, your methods were never conventional. But you know I've always been willing to give them a try! .........
Sholmes:
Dear God, Mikotoba, open your eyes! It was a metaphorical listening that I was suggesting!
Mikotoba:
(Ah...)
Mikotoba:
It's the Rules of Passage in this frame here. They're obviously out of place. The way they're hanging crooked on the wall...as if they were put there in a hurry.
Sholmes:
Yes, as I'm sure you've already concluded... ...that frame was originally over here. The shape and size are a perfect match.
Tchikin:
Da! You are right! When did frame move...?
Sholmes:
Hardly the most observant of crewmen, are you, Mr Strogenov? I would think your captain is quite justified in having his reservations about your reliability.
Tchikin:
Grrrrrr!
Mikotoba:
(Oh dear. That really seemed to touch a nerve.)
Sholmes:
So, Mikotoba...why don't you lift that frame off the wall?
Mikotoba:
That...that looks... ...like a bullet hole!
Tchikin:
What?! Who has been shooting walls?
Sholmes:
I see the projectile has been removed. Clearly the careful occupant of this room has already disposed of it. Now then, Mr Strogenov...
Tchikin:
Agh!
Sholmes:
...I have the distinct impression that you're attempting to shield said occupant.
Tchikin:
I don't know what you are talking about! Why would I try to protect Eastern stranger?
Sholmes:
Ah, so we're talking about the same man, I see. Good.
Tchikin:
Ugh!
Sholmes:
I'm sure we can get to the bottom of this in no time... aren't you? Because there's some very noteworthy evidence that explains the reason why you're lying for the man! Yes, you've been told to keep up this pretence, as clearly shown by...
Mikotoba:
I really don't know how to approach this one, Sholmes.
Sholmes:
Ah, my dear Mikotoba, simply keep first principles in mind. Study your subject from every angle... ...and I'm quite sure that you'll see it. In fact, I'd put a wager on it!
Mikotoba:
So I'm to glare at the fellow from all sides? Well, I can certainly do that...
Present wad of banknotes
Mikotoba:
Leads to:
"It's almost too obvious for words."
Present anything else
Mikotoba:
Sholmes:
Mikotoba. 'No games now' were my words, were they not?
Mikotoba:
Hmph. Come, Sholmes, where's the fun in life without a little fooling around, hm?
Sholmes:

Mikotoba:
(That was a close shave. I'd better rethink that before I'm the fool here...)
Leads to:
"Yes, you've been told to keep up this pretence, as clearly shown by..."
Yes, you've been told to keep up this pretence, as clearly shown by...
Mikotoba:
So a Russian crewman is aiding a Japanese man to evade capture by an English detective...
Sholmes:
Nationality needn't come into it. In this respect at least, all humans are the same. Ask yourself what can spur a man to do the bidding of another about whom he knows precious little. There is only one thing in the whole world with such repugnant, bottomless power!
Mikotoba:
Let's not get carried away now, Sholmes.
Mikotoba:
It's almost too obvious for words.
Sholmes:
Quite. The universal language of the world: money.
Tchikin:
Ah!
Mikotoba:
And I'd wager that the Eastern fellow in question... ...is Seishiro Jigoku. Yes?
Tchikin:
Gaaagh!
Mikotoba:
So, I presume you realise what this means? There are clear signs that a crime has been committed in this cabin. And the way you're going, sir, you'll find yourself accused of being an accomplice.
Tchikin:
B-But...
Sholmes:
I believe you know, Mr Strogenov... You know where Mr Jigoku is hiding at this precise moment in time!
Tchikin:
...!
Sholmes:
As always, Mikotoba, in matters of deduction, the furtive glance is your unfaltering ally.
Mikotoba:
Yes, I think you're onto something there, Sholmes. You've found the chink in this burly fellow's armour!
Sholmes:
We need only follow the man's gaze to know where our prey is hiding... The slightest flicker of the pupils... A minutely delayed blink... Nothing escapes my attention. Even that which is barely perceptible.
Mikotoba:
You could hardly call this barely perceptible, Sholmes. The man's turned his entire head. It's not exactly what you'd describe as a furtive glance, is it? It's almost too obvious...
Sholmes:
We shall let your tapping toes decide, my dear fellow!
Present large trunk
Mikotoba:
Leads to:
"You turned immediately to look at this large trunk, didn't you?"
Present anything else
Mikotoba:
Sholmes:
Mikotoba. 'No games now' were my words, were they not?

Hmph. Come, Sholmes, where's the fun in life without a little fooling around, hm?

Mikotoba:
(That was a close shave. I'd better rethink that before I'm the fool here...)
Leads to:
"We need only follow the man's gaze to know where our prey is hiding..."
We need only follow the man's gaze to know where our prey is hiding...
Mikotoba:
So...you really think he's hiding in here as we speak?
Sholmes:
Curled up in a ball at this very moment! But as I said earlier, we've no time for games today.
Mikotoba:
No, I quite understand. I'll make this as quick as I can. Seaman Strogenov will be suffering neck fatigue before long, I should think.
Mikotoba:
You turned immediately to look at this large trunk, didn't you?
Tchikin:
Aaah!
Mikotoba:
The truth is, Seishiro Jigoku was unable to escape from the ship in time... ...and is, at this very moment, doing his best to stifle his breath inside this trunk!
Sholmes:
If he still has a breath to take. I fear he may be running dangerously low on air.
Mikotoba:
Hm?
Sholmes:
I imagine he didn't count on us making a nuisance of ourselves for quite so long. I think it would be in everyone's best interests for us to open the trunk as quickly as possible.
Mikotoba:
B-But how can we? Are you forgetting about the combination lock? We don't know the seven-digit code!
Sholmes:
The combination lock can't be opened from inside the trunk. Therefore there must have been an arrangement for somebody to open it after our departure.
Mikotoba:
Of course...
Sholmes:
In short, before Jigoku hid himself inside that trunk... ...he must have told somebody the seven-digit number for the lock. As I'm sure you can confirm...Mr Strogenov!
Tchikin:
*Gulp!* No! I know nothing about combination code!
Sholmes:
Don't move a muscle, my good seaman!
Tchikin:
Huh?
Sholmes:
Now, Mikotoba...would you do the honours and open the trunk?
Mikotoba:
H-How on earth do you expect me...?
Sholmes:
It's a seven-digit number, remember. Quickly now! We have little time!
Present code "5231045"
Mikotoba:
Leads to:
"*Click!*"
Present any other code
Mikotoba:
 
Mikotoba:
No...it's refusing to open.
Sholmes:
Tell me, what number did you use?
Mikotoba:
Well...to begin with I thought I'd try my birthday.
Sholmes:
Your birthday? Interesting, since as of today with that absurd guesswork, you're dead to me.
Mikotoba:
...As measured as ever in response, Sholmes.
Sholmes:
If you would only look in the right place, Mikotoba, the answer would be staring you in the face.
Mikotoba:
The right place...?
Sholmes:
But if you're having a spot of bother, I always find standing on my head aids the cognitive processes.
Leads back to code entry
*Click!*
Mikotoba:
(That did it! It's open!)
???:
You had to meddle, didn't you...
Jigoku:
Well, Yujin, you've found me now.
Mikotoba:
Seishiro...
Mikotoba:
...I was really hoping beyond hope not to find you here, you know.
Jigoku:
But you're not entirely unsurprised, I take it?
Mikotoba:
No, quite. I just wish it were some other way.
Sholmes:
...Well? Are you ever going to introduce me?
Jigoku:
Ah, your reputation precedes you, Mr Sholmes. I've read stories of many of your exploits.
Mikotoba:
Excuse my manners, Sholmes. This is Mr Jigoku, my old friend and travelling companion.
Sholmes:
The devil is in the details, Mikotoba. I believe you meant to say: your old friend and travelling companion... ...who made the cowardly decision to flee the country without a word to anyone when things turned sour.
Jigoku:
...I see my reputation precedes me as well. What an honour.
Mikotoba:
Well, Seishiro? Are you going to explain all this?
Jigoku:
You know it all by now, I imagine. What you didn't know, of course, is that three days ago... ...on the night before our arrival in Britain, an attempt was made on my life here on this very ship.
Mikotoba:
By the Reaper of the Bailey? Yes, I've since heard. Because you were once prosecuted by the Reaper, weren't you? Ten years ago now, mind you.
Jigoku:
And I had no idea at the time what a dangerous individual he was. Anyway, when we arrived in London to find the symposium was postponed until goodness knows when... ...it became all too apparent to me that I might very well be targeted again.
Mikotoba:
So you decided to flee the capital, without saying a word to me about it?
Jigoku:
I'm afraid so, yes. Of course, I realise now... ...that I really ought to have confided in you.
???:
It's somewhat surprising, I must say...
Jigoku:
What is?
Sholmes:
Well, first-class cabins aboard luxury steamships are in very short supply. It's more than a little hard to believe that this one just happened to be available.
Jigoku:
So says the protagonist of some colourful short stories. Well, I don't care for your opinion. The cabin did just happen to be available. So I purchased a ticket and here I am.
Mikotoba:
I've just seen for myself the obvious remnants of that incident in this cabin. So you'd already purchased your return ticket before we even docked in Dover, had you? To prevent anyone else taking this cabin and seeing the evidence. Is that it?
Jigoku:
Yujin...I have nothing to say to you.
Sholmes:
Well, in a mere five minutes, this ship will set off on its onward voyage and not make port again until Italy. I'm afraid we must insist that you disembark with us at once.
Jigoku:
...You have no jurisdiction over my movements.
Mikotoba:
We have this, Seishiro. Take it.
Jigoku:
What is it?
Mikotoba:
It's a subpoena from the Old Bailey. You're a man of the law. You know what the ramifications of ignoring a document like this from the British courts would be.
Jigoku:
...You came prepared then, Yujin.
Mikotoba:
Come on, let's go.
Sholmes:
One moment...
Mikotoba:
What is it, Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Inside Mr Jigoku's trunk... ...I found this rather fascinating trinket.
Mikotoba:
What is that? Seishiro...?
Jigoku:
I can't help you, I'm afraid. Some small component from something. But what, I have no idea.
Mikotoba:
(By the look on his face...I think he genuinely doesn't know.)
Sholmes:
Well, let us pocket it as a small souvenir of our brief sojourn in France.
The small component has been entered into the Court Record.
Mikotoba:
(Well, young Naruhodo, I think we've done as much as we can, I'm afraid. The rest will be on the shoulders of you and your assistant!)
3rd November, 12:10 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Examine evidence
Small Component
Anywhere
Ryunosuke:
You see these little things all over the place, don't you? It's the part on the top of a pocket watch that you twist to set the time, isn't it?
Susato:
It's called 'the crown', I believe. A watch would be quite useless without one.
Ryunosuke:
The crown? Like what sits on top of a monarch's head? That's a very grand name for such a tiny part. But actually...
Susato:
Yes, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
...if this is a crown... ...I have a feeling I might have seen a monarch around here somewhere with a very bare head!
Susato:
...If by monarch you mean pocket watch, then I'm quite sure you have!
Anywhere (after examining anywhere on Small Component, then examining stub on top on Gregson's Pocket Watch)
Ryunosuke:
So this little part of Inspector Gregson's pocket watch was found inside Judge Jigoku's trunk.
Susato:
That's right. Which it cannot possibly be denied is extremely significant.
Ryunosuke:
And what do you call it again? This small, round piece of the watch.
Susato:
The crown. A pocket watch is quite useless without it.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's right. The crown. What a very grand name for such a tiny part.
Susato:
...That's exactly what you said the last time we discussed it, Mr Naruhodo.
Gregson's Pocket Watch
Stub on top (after examining anywhere on Small Component)
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
What do you think, Miss Susato?
Susato:
I feel sure I know exactly what will fit here.
Ryunosuke:
R-Really?! I was just thinking precisely the same thing!
Susato:
We're about to see that the little round component... ...is actually part of Inspector Gregson's broken pocket watch!
Ryunosuke:
R-Really?! I was just thinking precisely that, too!
Susato:
......... A perfect fit!
Ryunosuke:
I, I knew it!
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(...Alright, perhaps you knew it.)
Susato:
I'll make a note of this new information at once!
The details of the small component have been updated in the Court Record.
Stub on top (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
So a small part of Inspector Gregson's pocket watch was found inside Judge Jigoku's trunk...
Susato:
Yes, I believe that could be very significant indeed.
Ryunosuke:
And, um...what do you call it again?
Susato:
The crown. A pocket watch is quite useless without it.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's right. The crown. What a very grand name for such a tiny part.
Susato:
...That's exactly what you said the last time we discussed it, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
(Kazuma Asogi... I know you, and I know you wouldn't lie. But still, there's no doubt... ...that you're holding something back. You know more than you're saying!)
Stronghart:
During the past thirty minutes while this court was adjourned, all possible efforts were expended... ...but sadly Mr Jigoku's whereabouts could not be ascertained.
Kazuma:
We must accept the unfortunate conclusion that the Reaper has already done the deed.
Van Zieks:
.........
Kazuma:
There's no sense in wasting any more of the court's time. The prosecution calls for an immediate verdict.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
No. The trial cannot end now.
Kazuma:
You're a Japanese man, Ryunosuke. You should know when to lay down your sword.
Ryunosuke:
And you should know never to presume when the battle is won.
Kazuma:
The court has already been presented with all the evidence and heard all relevant testimony. And there can only be one conclusion: that the accused is guilty!
Ryunosuke:
All relevant testimony? Far from it. There's still a crucial witness from whom the court is yet to hear a single word of testimony!
Stronghart:
In that case, call your witness to the stand at once, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, My Lord. ...Tomorrow. ...If possible.
Susato:
The witness is already on his way and scheduled to arrive tomorrow.
Kazuma:
Who on earth is this crucial witness?
Ryunosuke:
...Seishiro Jigoku. The very man allegedly murdered by the Reaper!
Kazuma:
J-Judge Jigoku?! You've found him?!
Stronghart:
But the investigations of every policing resource in the capital suggest that Jigoku is already dead. How in the name of God did you find the man?
Ryunosuke:
He was located in France during the recess. At the Port of Dunkirk... ...thanks to one of Mr Herlock Sholmes's famous deductions.
Stronghart:
Herlock Sholmes...
Ryunosuke:
Inspector Gregson almost certainly met with Mr Jigoku on the night of his death. Because along with Prosecutor Asogi, Gregson was on a mission to assassinate the man.
Kazuma:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Which means that Seishiro Jigoku is the sole witness... ...who can clarify exactly what happened aboard the SS Grouse on the 31st October!
Stronghart:
Well...it would appear that it's too soon to move to adjudication at this point.
Kazuma:
......... The prosecution concurs. The court must hear Mr Jigoku's testimony. No judgement should be passed until all testimony has been considered.
Stronghart:
......... In that case, I hereby call the end of today's proceedings. Court will reconvene at the same hour tomorrow. ...No objections from either side?
Ryunosuke:
No, My Lord!
Kazuma:
No objections, My Lord.
Van Zieks:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(...We live to fight another day...by the skin of our teeth.)
Kazuma:
.........
To be continued...
Examine insignificant area on evidence
Ryunosuke:
I can't find anything out of place.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
The witness's last statement...exhibits a fundamental inconsistency!
Stronghart:
Not one that any British court would recognise, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?!
Stronghart:
Remember, this is a closed court. Whatever fate befalls you in here, no one outside will ever know.
Ryunosuke:
(...Should I be wondering if I'll make it out of this courtroom alive?)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
My Lord! As counsel for the defence, I must object to that last statement!
Stronghart:
And as the judge, I must deny your objection. There is no contradiction here.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Stronghart:
No contradiction, other than the fact that a Far Eastern lawyer is practising in a British courtroom!
Ryunosuke:
(...Put there by a not-so-far away Lord Chief Justice, if you remember.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
That last statement...seemed a little questionable to me. What do you think, My Lord?
Stronghart:
I see no inconsistency there. ...Do you?
Ryunosuke:
Erm...
Stronghart:
You could span the Straits of Dover with those wide eyes, Counsel. And be gone from this island forever, I hope.
Ryunosuke:
(Do you want me to fill the English Channel with tears?)
Pursue Gina Lestrade incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Do you have something to say about that, Gina?
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Gina...?
Gina:
...'Ow'd it come to this, eh, boss...?
Ryunosuke:
(She's lost in her thoughts about Gregson... I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. I probably shouldn't pursue her too hard unless she really reacts strangely to something.)
Stronghart:
Let's focus on the testimony, please, Counsel.
Pursue Barok van Zieks incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks!
Van Zieks:
Let me guess: is there something about the witness's last statement that troubles me? Is that what you wish to ask?
Ryunosuke:
Y-Yes... Exactly... You're very perceptive.
Van Zieks:
Whereas you...would appear not to be.
Ryunosuke:
Huh?
Van Zieks:
You really need to learn how to read your fellow man... my Nipponese friend.
Ryunosuke:
(...Read them...or 'reap' them?)
Too many penalties
Stronghart:
We've wasted enough time! It's clear to me that any further discussion of this case will be fruitless. Barok van Zieks, I would like to think that however misguided... ...you acted out of a sense of justice nonetheless. Though it pains me to have reached this conclusion...
Ryunosuke:
No! Wait, My Lord!
Stronghart:
In accordance with the findings of this court, I hereby pronounce the defendant, Barok van Zieks...
Guilty
Stronghart:
That concludes business. Court is adjourned!
Nothing to examine during investigation
Mikotoba:
(Nothing much of note here, I'd say.)
Too many errors during dance of deduction
Sholmes:
It seems we've followed this single strand of reasoning to its unsatisfactory conclusion. Perhaps you're a little out of practice after ten years of absence from brilliance.
Mikotoba:
Well, it's a long time to go without a paradiddle. I confess my feet are a little rusty.
Sholmes:
Your feet are the least of your worries. The oxidation has gone to the brain, I fear. Let us take to the dance floor again, with renewed vigour!
Mikotoba:
Try to stop me! I'm itching to tap out the true answer to this riddle!
Leads back to:
"W-What is this?"
