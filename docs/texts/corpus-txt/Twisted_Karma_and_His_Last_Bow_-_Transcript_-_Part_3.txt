2nd November, 3:38 p.m.
Sholmes's Suite
Ryunosuke:
I still can't quite believe what just happened.
Susato:
I know. I enquired with the bailiff after the court session was adjourned... ...and it seems Mr Vigil was taken to hospital to recover.
Ryunosuke:
Right...
Ten years ago now... ...Mr Vigil attempted to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of the prison governor's office. But ever since then...he's completely blocked the memory of those events from his mind. Nobody knew his secret. Not his family. Not even the man himself. But I...I forced it out into the open. Was it wrong of me to do that? Did I overstep the mark, I wonder...?
???:
Ruuunooo!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Iris...
Iris:
You were miles away! Anyway, I've brewed a fresh pot of soothing tea for you.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, thank you.
Iris:
You and Susie have had an exhausting day so far, haven't you?
Susato:
Oh! ......... Thank you, Iris. How thoughtful of you.
Ryunosuke:
Do you happen to know where Mr Sholmes is? When we came out of the courtroom back into the defendants' antechamber, he'd disappeared.
Iris:
Oh...no, I don't know. He just suddenly sprang to his feet and left. All he said was, 'I must leave.'
Susato:
I wonder if he's pursuing the mystery of Inspector Gregson's death...
Iris:
......... Well, you know what Hurley's always saying, don't you? 'There are mysteries in this world that should perhaps never be solved.'
Ryunosuke:
...!
Iris:
'For the construction of a solution comes only at the expense of the destruction of something else...'
Ryunosuke:
(What does that mean...?)
Iris:
He knows very well that when you open someone else's old wounds, you often open your own, too. But he just can't take his own advice and leave well alone. Solving mysteries is too important to him.
Ryunosuke:
That's so true.
Iris:
But that's what I like about Hurley, after all!
Ryunosuke:
(I suppose that's the lot of a great detective in some ways...)
Iris:
So then... ...let's have tea and then I'll give you a hand!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Do you have time, Iris?
Iris:
Yes, I've finished this month's manuscript at last. With barely a day to spare before the deadline!
Susato:
Oh, I'm so looking forward to it. A brand new story to read in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'!
Iris:
You know, I always hide Hurley's violin in the days before I have a deadline.
Ryunosuke:
You, you do? (Poor Mr Sholmes...)
Susato:
I'm sure that's very wise, Iris. How sensible of you!
Iris:
Now then, my dear fellows, let's make a plan of action before we continue our investigation!
Converse
This morning's trial
Iris:
So, how did it go in court this morning?
Ryunosuke:
Well, we still don't know the truth about what really happened, but one thing's increasingly clear: Lord van Zieks definitely didn't do it.
Iris:
Oh, goodie!
Susato:
Yes, that's right. We managed to uncover several new facts as well!
Iris:
Oh! Really?
Ryunosuke:
And...there was another development, too. (Kazuma.)
Susato:
Yes, it's quite clear now... ...that Kazuma-sama is not himself. The way he's acting, it's almost as if he's...possessed.
Ryunosuke:
I know. I mean, at the end of the proceedings earlier... ...he was like a bloodhound the way he was chasing down Mr Vigil's forgotten past. (He's not normally so mercilessly persistent.)
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(What's going on in his head, I wonder. I really need to sit down with Kazuma and try to understand what he's going through...)
The Reaper's innocence
Ryunosuke:
If Gregson was really murdered the day before his body was discovered... ...then Lord van Zieks has to be innocent, you see.
Iris:
What?! The day before? Well that should be easy enough to work out just by examining the corpse, surely?
Susato:
Yes, you would expect so. But curiously... ...no time of death was included in the autopsy report.
Iris:
Hm, that is curious.
Ryunosuke:
There are still unanswered questions about Lord van Zieks, though, aren't there?
Susato:
Ah, do you mean...?
Ryunosuke:
I mean what was he doing there on Fresno Street that day in the first place?
Susato:
Well according to the man's testimony... ...he said he was investigating Inspector Gregson, didn't he?
Ryunosuke:
And it turns out that little room was actually the inspector's secret office...
Iris:
Ooh, that sounds like it has all the makings of a wonderfully devilish plot!
Ryunosuke:
But then why was that noticeboard in there covered in all those particular papers? Papers about cases with a link to the Reaper. ...I'm starting to get a bad feeling about all this.
Iris:
Oh dear... That sounds more like something horribly devilish...
Susato:
We must start by looking into Inspector Gregson's movements of late!
Gregson's movements (appears after "The Reaper's innocence")
Ryunosuke:
I never imagined I might have to be investigating an inspector's movements.
Susato:
Well, according to the entry in his diary... ...he was carrying out an incognito investigation of the Red-Headed League the day before his death.
Iris:
Oh! You, you mean he was doing the same as Hurley?
Ryunosuke:
Well...Mr Sholmes was trying to apply, whereas the inspector was supposed to be investigating.
Susato:
I do wish it had been the other way around...
Ryunosuke:
...Anyway, as it turns out, the inspector who went to investigate the Red-Headed League that day... ...wasn't actually Gregson at all. It was Mr Vigil, in possession of Gregson's identification.
Iris:
Hm, you know what that sounds like to me? Establishing an alibi.
Susato:
Oh my! Yes, you're absolutely right, Iris!
Ryunosuke:
But...why would Gregson need an alibi?
Susato:
It would appear that the inspector... ...had something to do that he wished to keep secret.
Iris:
I don't believe it... I, I always thought he was just a harmless lover of fish and chips...
Ryunosuke:
But perhaps they were seasoned with something a little more potent than salt and vinegar...
Susato:
I think perhaps...we should try to move away from food analogies?
Ryunosuke:
...Well anyway, if Lord van Zieks felt the need to investigate Gregson...
Susato:
Yes, I agree. We must try to find out what he knows.
Mr Vigil's condition
Iris:
Vigil, you say? Isn't that the name of the lady who came to visit Hurley yesterday?
Susato:
That's right. To ask Mr Sholmes if he would help her to find her missing husband.
Ryunosuke:
Only Mr Sholmes completely passed the buck to us. ...Actually, didn't you say that Mr Vigil had been taken to hospital? Do you know which one?
Susato:
Ah, it's St Synner's.
Ryunosuke:
...I'm starting to wonder if all the other hospitals in London have closed down...
Iris:
But that's amazing, Runo! You've found the lady's husband already!
Ryunosuke:
Well...I suppose I have. By accident.
Susato:
And ten years ago, while Mr Vigil was the chief warder at the prison... ...he was responsible for overseeing the Professor's incarceration.
Iris:
No!
Ryunosuke:
So when the convict escaped, he was held responsible and immediately dismissed.
Iris:
Ugh...sometimes I really don't want to grow up.
Ryunosuke:
There's more. For ten years after that... ...while he was ostensibly working as a pedlar, he also had another secret job. He was paid by Gregson to be his stand-in. To impersonate the inspector.
Iris:
To impersonate Gregsy?! But, but why?
Ryunosuke:
...I have absolutely no idea.
Iris:
Ugh...Ginny was right. I'm starting to think all adults are up to no good now. Including you, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
...I haven't paid anyone to impersonate me.
Susato:
That means he has ties to the Professor and to Inspector Gregson, though. So I do think we ought to pay a visit to Mr Vigil, don't you?
Ryunosuke:
(Back to St Synner's, then...)
Present
Armband
Ryunosuke:
Iris, have you seen this?
Iris:
Your armband? The symbol of a defence lawyer in Japan? Runo, you've shown that to me dozens of times.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...have I? The thing is, I just feel wrong if I don't have it on my arm, you know.
Iris:
Well if you ask me, I think you should try wearing something different every now and then.
Ryunosuke:
Oh really? Like what?
Iris:
Well...I could make something for you, if you like? How about a band that squeezes your arm when the person you're talking to tells a lie?
Ryunosuke:
...I'll keep a space free on my left arm, then.
Red-Headed League Article
Iris:
I thought it was strange, you know. When Hurley suddenly decided to turn his hair red like that, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
You mean, he didn't tell you why? He didn't mention the Red-Headed League to you?
Iris:
I'll bet it's because he wanted to keep that four pounds a week all for himself.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes, I see. Because your hair has a reddish hue too, you mean? Right...
Iris:
Anyway, at least I have a good starting point for next month's instalment now!
Ryunosuke:
(Iris must be the only person who's actually going to manage to benefit from this whole sorry affair...)
Red Hairpiece
Iris:
Oh...this looks like it's made from real human hair.
Ryunosuke:
I thought it might be.
Iris:
Yes, people will pay money for long hair that's in good condition. Hurley once offered his hair up for sale, you know. He grew it right down to his shoulders.
Ryunosuke:
Really?! How much did he make?
Iris:
No one would buy it.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Iris:
He was told it was 'unruly' apparently.
Ryunosuke:
(Oh. Maybe I'd better give up on the idea as well, then.)
Autopsy Report, Photograph of the Victim, Gregson's Pocket Watch, or Inspector's Identification
Ryunosuke:
Um, Iris, about this...
Iris:
...! .........
Ryunosuke:
(Oh no! What was I thinking? Why on earth did I show her that?)
Iris:
Poor Gregsy...
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Iris, have a look at this...
Iris:
That's not right. I thought you were supposed to say 'Objection!' or the like when you present evidence?
Ryunosuke:
No no. That's only in court.
Iris:
That's not fair! If you won't say it, then I won't look! Hmph!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Iris:
Yay! That was great! Right...next!
Ryunosuke:
(Alright, I get the message. Someone's not in the mood for looking at things...)
After clearing all Converse options:
Iris:
Well, I think it's clear what we need to do, isn't it? Let us investigate, my dear fellows!
Susato:
Oh, Iris! You're even more enthusiastic than usual today.
Iris:
If anyone has anything to hide, my special Wilson Shooting Iron will soon set them straight!
Ryunosuke:
...That...water pistol?
Iris:
It's stuffed full of a piping-hot extra-special blend of mine!
Susato:
Then I'm quite sure it will be very effective.
Ryunosuke:
(...I'd better be careful not to hide anything.) Well...it feels a little strange that Mr Sholmes is nowhere to be seen, but still... ...let's go and see what we can find out!
Yes!
2nd November
Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy
Converse
What to do
Susato:
Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo? It's rather unusual to find ourselves here in the middle of our investigations...
Ryunosuke:
It's, it's just occurred to me that I might have forgotten something when we left this morning.
Susato:
Please don't worry. As long as you continue to investigate thoroughly, you won't go far wrong!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes, of course! I must get back to work as soon as possible!
2nd November
British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office
Stronghart:
No arguments, Prosecutor Asogi. You will continue with the trial exactly as I instructed. Is that clear?
Kazuma:
...Perfectly.
Susato:
It's Kazuma-sama!
Ryunosuke:
Defying Lord Stronghart, by the sound of it. He never did know when to back down.
Stronghart:
On your way now, Asogi.
Kazuma:
...My Lord. .........
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma... (He left without saying a word...)
Stronghart:
Yes? What are you doing here?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um...well, erm...I was just hoping to ask you a few questions, if you wouldn't mind.
Stronghart:
I wanted van Zieks's trial concluded today. But Prosecutor Asogi's unwelcome inquiries are going to make it take longer than necessary.
Ryunosuke:
Unwelcome inquiries...?
Stronghart:
As a result, I'm losing even more precious time. Currently two hours, fifty-five minutes and forty-one seconds. ...Forty-two...forty-three...
Susato:
Then we must resolve everything before three hours have passed, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
...In a miraculous not-even-five minutes? (Anyway, I can't let the man's obvious bad mood put me off... I need information!)
Converse
The Reaper
Ryunosuke:
Does Prosecutor Asogi believe...that Lord van Zieks is the Reaper?
Stronghart:
I wouldn't know. It was ten years ago, in that fateful closed trial, that Lord van Zieks made a name for himself among the judiciary. But the next trial he fought, he lost. It meant the ringleader of a criminal organisation was acquitted...thanks to all the jurors being under duress.
Ryunosuke:
But that's awful!
Stronghart:
The man's freedom was short-lived. He lasted just three days.
Susato:
Yes, let me see...he died in a rockslide at his place of work, I believe!
Stronghart:
Correct. That was the inauguration of the Reaper of the Bailey.
Ryunosuke:
And people believed Lord van Zieks was responsible?
Stronghart:
He was brought to trial himself. ...But it was shown to have been an accident.
Ryunosuke:
(So he must have had a solid alibi then.)
Stronghart:
Nevertheless, the mysterious deaths continued. In total, sixteen persons perished in unusual circumstances, ostensibly at the hand of the Reaper. ...That's a long run of coincidences.
Susato:
Well, the Reaper's true identity may well be revealed by this trial.
Stronghart:
And the impact that revelation would have on the British public cannot be understated.
Ryunosuke:
...Is that why it's a closed trial?
Stronghart:
Precisely.
Closed trial
Stronghart:
This country hasn't seen a closed trial for ten years.
Ryunosuke:
So the last one...was the Professor's? The trial of Genshin Asogi?
Stronghart:
Correct.
Ryunosuke:
Actually, we heard that originally... ...you were going to prosecute that trial yourself, Lord Stronghart.
Stronghart:
Van Zieks entreated me to relinquish the prosecution to him. That he might avenge his brother's death. And here we are, ten years later... ...with the son of the man van Zieks had condemned now looking to avenge his father's death in the same way.
Ryunosuke:
(They do say that what goes around comes around...)
Stronghart:
However, it would seem... ...that the new young prosecutor is harbouring some ulterior motive as well.
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma is?
Stronghart:
I like my organisation to run smoothly, in the exact manner that I prescribe. As with the giant clock in here, I won't tolerate a single cog being out of step with the others!
Ryunosuke:
(Ah...so that's what all these gears are about in here...)
Stronghart:
If the young man refuses to mesh with the other parts of my great machine... ...I will be forced to take steps.
Ryunosuke:
What, what do you mean?
Stronghart:
......... Not something with which you need concern yourself. In any case, all your questions will be answered tomorrow.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Present
Armband
Stronghart:
Your defence lawyer's blazon? It clearly means a lot to you.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes. It's a keepsake from my best friend as well as a symbol of what I'm trying to achieve.
Susato:
But that friend has returned to us now, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Well, until it's time to return this to him, I intend to keep wearing it proudly on my arm.
Susato:
But that friend is going to face you in court, Mr Naruhodo.
Stronghart:
...A complicated situation by the sound of it.
Red-Headed League Article
Ryunosuke:
Are you aware of the Red-Headed League, Lord Stronghart?
Stronghart:
No. I didn't read that advertisement.
Susato:
It seems they were trying to swindle red-heads.
Stronghart:
I see. Well...I suppose I would be in the White-Headed League, if anything.
Ryunosuke:
That sounds rather like an elderly gentlemen's club.
Stronghart:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Oops, I have a feeling... ...I might have made a bit of a faux pas there.)
After clearing all Converse options:
Stronghart:
Now, I shall have to ask you to excuse me. As of this moment, I've been delayed from attending my next meeting by precisely three hours.
Susato:
Oh my! That is a long time!
Stronghart:
And I hold you entirely responsible.
Ryunosuke:
(Even though we miraculously managed to fit everything into not-even-five minutes?) ......... Um, I wonder if you might agree... ...to us, um...talking with Prosecutor Asogi?
Stronghart:
Discussions between the defence and the prosecution outside of the courtroom are generally frowned upon. However, I will make an exception in this case. Now go! You can find him in his office.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Thank you!
Susato:
Let's go to see him at once, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
(Kazuma's my best friend in the world, but... ...I'm really not at all sure I know how to talk to him at the moment.)
2nd November
Local Prison, Cell 1
Susato:
...Lord van Zieks is reading, look.
Iris:
He doesn't seem like he wants visitors, does he?
Ryunosuke:
But he must have noticed that we're here, surely?
Van Zieks:
......... What do you Nipponese want?
Ryunosuke:
That's no way to greet the lawyer who's trying his hardest to prove your innocence, is it?
Van Zieks:
......... Perhaps not.
Ryunosuke:
Hm?!
Van Zieks:
I apologise. So, what can I do for you, Mr Naruhodo?
Susato:
Lord van Zieks...speaking earnestly!
Iris:
Oh, the fog will lift over London for the first time in months tomorrow!
Ryunosuke:
(This does feel very, very strange...)
Van Zieks:
......... I must say, I was impressed.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Well...thank you!
Van Zieks:
Not by you. By your fellow Nipponese. Your prosecutor friend.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...I see. Yes.
Van Zieks:
It's sardonic, don't you think? For a man such as me, so loathing of the Nipponese, to be entirely at the mercy of the two of you. I suppose... ...it's retribution for having played the part of the Reaper all these years.
Ryunosuke:
(Played the part...?)
Converse
The Reaper's identity
Ryunosuke:
You once told me that you gladly allowed people to believe you were the Reaper... ...because it helped reduce the amount of serious crime that took place in London.
Van Zieks:
If keeping quiet and playing the part benefits the cause - a cause I myself am committed to pursuing... ...then why would I choose to say anything?
Ryunosuke:
But the henchmen of a criminal killed by the Reaper attacked you only the other day. And that was just the most recent of many attempts on your life, wasn't it? Someone is clearly profiting from your silence about all this! Someone is using you!
Van Zieks:
......... Believe me, ever since the Reaper first appeared... ...I've been doing my utmost to expose him. Or rather...expose the organisation.
Susato:
Ah! It's a whole organisation?!
Van Zieks:
It's inconceivable that all those 'accidents' were orchestrated by one man. No, the Reaper always appears to have very accurate information about the accused in each case. Which can only mean... ...that somebody at Scotland Yard is involved.
Susato:
Someone at... You, you can't mean...?!
Van Zieks:
It's taken me many years, but I've finally identified the central figure in this Reaper organisation: ...Tobias Gregson.
Susato:
No... NOOOOOO!
Ryunosuke:
(Gregson! The Reaper?!)
Gregson's secret (appears after "The Reaper's identity")
Ryunosuke:
So...the reason you were investigating Inspector Gregson is because... ...you intended to expose him as the Reaper?!
Van Zieks:
As I said, the Reaper of the Bailey is no single person. It's a highly secret organisation with close ties to Scotland Yard. But there's no doubt that Gregson was a key member of that organisation.
Susato:
I, I don't believe it...
Iris:
Are you saying that Gregsy...? That he was behind all those awful criminals meeting their...?
Van Zieks:
Gregson didn't do the dirty work himself.
Susato:
Oh!
Van Zieks:
He was the tactician. His job was to covertly investigate the marks and plot their assassinations. In order to do that without arousing suspicion, he regularly needed a firm alibi.
Ryunosuke:
...Which is where Mr Vigil came in. Posing as the inspector...
Van Zieks:
Vigil knows nothing of the Reaper. But the room he rents on Fresno Street was almost certainly the headquarters of the operation. Gregson would have met the assassin there for briefings.
Ryunosuke:
So we don't actually know who carried out the killings, then?
Van Zieks:
...Actually, I do have a name.
Ryunosuke:
You... WHAT?!
Susato:
Well if you can name the man, you have the true identity of the Reaper already, then!
Van Zieks:
Or...if I can name the woman.
Susato:
Oh...
Van Zieks:
She's a young woman by the name of Asa Shinn.
Ryunosuke:
Wait... WHAAAT?! ('Shin'?!)
Miss Asa Shinn... The true name of a terrifying killer I know only too well. She came to Japan posing as a visiting student and murdered Dr John H. Wilson. Then, just when it seemed that diplomatic protection would help her escape Japan and conviction... ...the mysterious woman was herself murdered in a small summer beach hut. And that woman... was actually the Reaper of the Bailey?!
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, this perhaps isn't the place to discuss...
Ryunosuke:
No. No, of course not. (We can't mention it here. The fact that she killed Dr John H. Wilson. Because Iris doesn't know and it's very likely that the man was her father.)
Iris:
...?
Susato:
Asa Shinn... I should let Father know at once!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I agree.
Prosecutor Asogi
Van Zieks:
Kazuma, isn't it? Kazuma Asogi. You say he's a friend of yours.
Ryunosuke:
My best friend. He's the whole reason I got to come to Britain. It was all on his merits. I have nothing but respect for him.
Van Zieks:
Yes, I understand that only the very best students are selected for such opportunities. And I had a fine demonstration of how sharp he is in the proceedings earlier today. He missed nothing. In fact, his flawless performance very much reminded me...of his father.
Ryunosuke:
(Genshin Asogi. The Professor...)
Van Zieks:
It's true that the aristocracy at the time was the root of numerous grave societal problems. They were abusing their power. Playing with the common man as pawns in politics...in economics...in war. In many ways, Asogi was carving out a canker from society that we British couldn't deal with ourselves.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, I... I see...
Van Zieks:
But that's precisely why it makes no sense. Klint van Zieks was a noble and upstanding man. He wasn't corrupt. Why did that damned Nipponese have to go and take my brother's life? ...In spite of having once saved mine.
Ryunosuke:
He saved your life? (How did that happen?)
Saving your life (appears after "Prosecutor Asogi")
Van Zieks:
It was ten years ago, on a foggy night. What was to be the Professor's final strike had...sent a wave of panic through the capital.
Ryunosuke:
(So Klint van Zieks had already been killed at this point, then.)
Van Zieks:
Genshin and I were walking down some back streets at a late hour. Of course, at that point, I had no idea of the true nature of the man at my side. All of a sudden...
Don't make a peep! You're comin' with us!
Van Zieks:
We were surrounded. All of our assailants were armed with pistols, their faces obscured by scarves. Klint was not only from noble heritage, he was a brilliant prosecutor as well. The scum of London hated the sight of him. And they had no sympathy for his younger brother, either. I'd been targeted several times before already.
...Yeah, it's van Zieks alright. We've got 'im!
Van Zieks:
I could hear them murmuring amongst themselves. I knew they were after me. But just when I thought my time had come...
...If I let them kill you, Klint would never forgive me.
Van Zieks:
It was Asogi's voice. Just a whisper in my ear.
*Bang!*
Van Zieks:
After that, I don't remember exactly what happened. The next thing I knew, there was silence all around. Genshin lay on the cobbled street. Blood was seeping from his left hand. He'd shielded me. Two days later...they arrested him. On suspicion of being London's most notorious mass murderer ever: the Professor.
Susato:
How awful for you...
Van Zieks:
All at once, I lost the brother I revered and the foreign friend I held in such high regard.
Ryunosuke:
I'm so sorry, Lord van Zieks...
Present
Anything else
Van Zieks:
What's that?
Ryunosuke:
Ah, it's just something I was hoping to ask your opinion about, that's all.
Van Zieks:
It's a serious crime for the defence to attempt to extract information from the prosecution by illegal means.
Ryunosuke:
...I think we have more of a defence and client relationship now...don't we?
After clearing all Converse options:
Van Zieks:
That's the end of my miserable tale. ...I never thought I'd recount it to anyone.
Ryunosuke:
Well, thank you...for confiding in me.
Susato:
The Professor, the Reaper and Inspector Gregson... I wonder just how intimately related they all are...
Ryunosuke:
I still can't quite believe that Gregson was essentially the Reaper. (Giving assassination orders to Jezaille Brett...)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, let's go and inform my father! I'm sure our government will want to hear about this new information.
Iris:
Oh! That means I get to meet your daddy, Susie! Hurray!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, alright. (Let's head back to the Great Waterloo Hotel then!)
2nd November
Great Waterloo Hotel Foyer
Susato:
I thought it yesterday and I think it again today. This place is so...princely.
Ryunosuke:
It's a wild guess, but I have a feeling you'll think the same tomorrow, too.
Iris:
My tea has a finer fragrance than whatever they're serving in the tea room here though, wouldn't you say?
???:
Ah, look who we have here! This is an unexpected pleasure.
Susato:
Ah...Father!
Iris:
Ooh! Is this your daddy, Susie? How lovely!
Mikotoba:
...What a charming young lady. And you are...?
Mikotoba:
Ah, really? So you're the author of 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', are you?
Iris:
That's me! Iris Wilson, at your service, sir! Susie's been such a wonderful friend to me over the last year, you know!
Mikotoba:
Well, Miss Wilson... I must say I read your work regularly and with much interest.
Susato:
Iris actually lives with Mr Sholmes, you know, Father.
Mikotoba:
Is that so? Well, perhaps that goes some way to explaining that bright look in your eyes.
Iris:
Hee hee!
Ryunosuke:
(You wouldn't be smiling so airily if you knew just how bright she is, believe me.)
Mikotoba:
Now then, young Naruhodo. It was a pleasure seeing you in action earlier. As an invitee of the symposium, I was allowed to observe from the gallery. ...After I twisted some arms. And I must say, it was a truly exemplary performance!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Well...thank you very much. (Although I'm fairly sure you omitted 'by Kazuma' on the end there.)
Mikotoba:
No no no, please don't misunderstand! It was you who impressed me.
Ryunosuke:
Really?!
Mikotoba:
You didn't miss a step against Asogi. And we all know how capable he is. Really, to have matured into such a fine defence lawyer in less than a year is quite extraordinary.
Ryunosuke:
It's...very kind of you to say so. (And really nice to hear.)
Mikotoba:
What I saw in court today confirmed what I'd been hoping for. The favour I mentioned yesterday, Naruhodo. I trust you haven't forgotten?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! No, you...you did mention something, didn't you?
Susato:
But first! We have something to report, Father.
Mikotoba:
Of course, of course. Shall we take tea while we discuss matters further?
Ryunosuke:
(Hm... ...I wonder where Judge Jigoku has got to.)
Converse
About the Reaper
Susato:
Father, do you know about the so-called Reaper of the Bailey?
Mikotoba:
I've heard rumours. Some members of the judiciary explained it all to me yesterday. Of course, when I was a visitng student here in London, the Reaper was yet to emerge.
Ryunosuke:
(Right, he didn't appear until after that case when the visiting students had already returned home.)
Mikotoba:
Lord van Zieks who was in the dock today... That was Barok, the younger brother of Klint van Zieks, I believe.
Susato:
That's right. And he's known throughout London as the Reaper, as you've heard. But the truth is... ...it wasn't him behind all of those mysterious deaths. It was somebody else!
Mikotoba:
I see... So what you're saying is, there's been a professional killer at work here?
Ryunosuke:
Exactly. Someone by the name of Asa Shinn, in fact.
Mikotoba:
...I beg your pardon? Did, did you say...Asa Shinn?! You mean that Jezaille Brett woman who was responsible for killing my great friend?!
Iris:
Oh no! A friend of yours was killed?
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Um...Professor Mikotoba, I think perhaps we shouldn't discuss this right now...
Mikotoba:
...!
Ryunosuke:
(Because the friend the professor is talking about is Dr John H. Wilson. And that's not something we want Iris to find out about. Not like this, anyway...)
Dr. Wilson's death (appears after "About the Reaper")
Susato:
...Ah! I've, I've just remembered something... Biscuits! This hotel...has the most delicious-looking biscuits!
Mikotoba:
That was rather out of the blue.
Ryunosuke:
...! (She's doing this deliberately.)
Susato:
I think I'll go and see if I can purchase some. I wonder...would you like to come too, Iris?
Iris:
Oh yes! You just try to leave me behind!
Mikotoba:
So that young girl... ...is called Iris Wilson, is she?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's right.
Mikotoba:
And she's the author of all those adventure stories starring the great detective Sholmes? But the name of the credited author isn't Iris, is it? It's Dr John H. Wilson.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I know. That's the name of her father, you see.
Mikotoba:
Her father? Dr John H. Wilson... I was deeply indebted to the man for all the kindness he showed me during my time in London. That's why I was keen to reciprocate and invite him to the Imperial Yumei University four years ago. .........
Ryunosuke:
But he was murdered last year...by Jezaille Brett. (Why? Why would the hand of the Reaper stretch all the way to Japan?) Iris knows nothing about that case. But it seems very likely that the victim, Dr Wilson, was her father.
Mikotoba:
Well...I can't say that we ever spoke about his family. So I don't know if he had a daughter or not. But I think I can say with some certainty...that he was never the great detective's partner.
Ryunosuke:
So...it could have been another Dr Wilson, you think?
Mikotoba:
Well...John and Wilson are both common names, after all. Still, it's probably best not to mention this to the young lady until we can be sure.
Ryunosuke:
...That's what we thought, yes.
Iris:
We're back! With cinnamon biscuits!
Ryunosuke:
Ooh! They smell delicious, Iris!
Iris:
I think cinnamon will go very well with the tea they serve here. Don't you, Susie?
Susato:
Yes. I'm sure you're right, Iris!
Judge Jigoku
Ryunosuke:
I haven't seen Judge Jigoku for a while, have you?
Jigoku:
Guilty! Hah hah hah hah hah!
Ryunosuke:
(But that 'guilty' is still ringing in my ears...)
Mikotoba:
No, now you mention it, I haven't seen him since this morning, either. I suppose since the symposium's opening was postponed he'll have gone to explore at the Great Exhibition.
Susato:
That reminds me of something you mentioned yesterday. About Judge Jigoku having once been in the dock himself?
Mikotoba:
Ah yes... It was all tied up with that accursed trial.
Ryunosuke:
(The closed trial...of Kazuma's father...)
Mikotoba:
Seishiro was trying to mitigate Genshin's guilt, so he took to the stand to testify. But he...got a little carried away and, um...actually managed to break the witness stand.
Susato:
Oh my!
Mikotoba:
He also said some contemptuous words about the British Empire...for which he was charged.
Ryunosuke:
Oh dear... Although it's worryingly easy to imagine him doing that.
Mikotoba:
Well, it was all alright in the end. He was acquitted and we returned home to Japan together.
Susato:
Thank goodness!
Mikotoba:
Ah yes, talking of Seishiro... ...I have a copy of the photograph we all took together here yesterday. ...Please.
Susato:
Oh, what a lovely picture!
Ryunosuke:
It certainly seems to shout, 'We've arrived in Britain!'
The commemorative photograph has been entered into the Court Record.
Mikotoba:
None of us had any idea what was coming when we took that, did we?
Susato:
No... No, that's so true...
Judge Jigoku (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
I haven't seen Judge Jigoku for a while, have you?
Jigoku:
Guilty! Hah hah hah hah hah!
Ryunosuke:
(But that 'guilty' is still ringing in my ears...)
Mikotoba:
No, now you mention it, I haven't seen him since this morning, either. I suppose since the symposium's opening was postponed he'll have gone to explore at the Great Exhibition.
Susato:
That reminds me of something you mentioned yesterday. About Judge Jigoku having once been in the dock himself?
Mikotoba:
Ah yes... It was all tied up with that accursed trial.
Ryunosuke:
(The closed trial...of Kazuma's father...)
Mikotoba:
Seishiro was trying to mitigate Genshin's guilt, so he took to the stand to testify. But he...got a little carried away, and um...actually managed to break the witness stand.
Susato:
Oh my!
Seishiro:
He also said some contemptuous words about the British Empire...for which he was charged.
Ryunosuke:
Oh dear... Although it's worryingly easy to imagine him doing that.
Mikotoba:
Well, it was all alright in the end. He was acquitted and we returned home to Japan together.
Susato:
Thank goodness!
The favour
Ryunosuke:
So...you mentioned a favour that you'd like to ask me.
Mikotoba:
......... Well, this...fateful trial that you're fighting... One way or another, it will be over before long. And when it is, I'd like you to accompany me back to Japan.
Ryunosuke:
You want me to do...
Iris:
WHAAAT?!
Susato:
F-Father! What's the meaning of this?
Mikotoba:
Now, Susato, you should understand. You've seen how our courts work firsthand. Japan's judicial system is in its infancy. Especially when it comes to defence.
Susato:
Oh! You mean...?
Mikotoba:
The Supreme Court of Judicature is in desperate need of a good defence lawyer. As soon as possible. Really quite urgently, in fact.
Ryunosuke:
B-But...I've not even been in London a year yet!
Mikotoba:
I've read all of Susato's reports. I'm well aware of your extraordinary talents. And having seen you in action with my own eyes earlier today, there's no question: You, Naruhodo, are precisely the man our country needs.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Iris:
So...you'd be leaving then, Runo?
Susato:
But then...what am I supposed to do, Father?
Mikotoba:
......... You came here to serve as Asogi's judicial assistant.
Ryunosuke:
...! (Oh, yes...she's supposed to be Kazuma's assistant...)
Mikotoba:
Our government is still in the process of deciding how best to deal with his situation, though.
Susato:
.........
Mikotoba:
You've always chosen your own path, Susato. And I trust your judgement. ...In this matter also.
Susato:
Father!
Mikotoba:
Please, the pair of you... Don't look so downcast. It's merely a suggestion, you understand. A hope, if I'm honest. But I won't force you. All I ask is that you consider it, and come to a decision by the time this trial concludes.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...alright.
Iris:
You, you won't leave...will you, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
......... (The thought hadn't even crossed my mind. Up until now, I've just been trying to do what I believed to be Kazuma's will. But it turns out that he's still alive, so... ...where does that leave me?)
Present
Armband
Ryunosuke:
Look at this, Professor Mikotoba.
Mikotoba:
Ah...Kazuma's armband. He was wearing that when he left for Great Britain. How curious. It doesn't strike me at all as odd to see you wearing it. It rather suits you.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Mikotoba:
Are you intending to return it to him?
Ryunosuke:
Well, yes... I mean, it has his name on it. Now that we've found out he's alive, it doesn't make sense for me to keep it.
Mikotoba:
Well, if you ask me... ...I think Kazuma would be delighted to see you wearing it.
Ryunosuke:
......... Well, I'd feel honoured if that were true.
Letter of Introduction
Ryunosuke:
Professor, thank you very much for this letter of introduction.
Mikotoba:
You're welcome. Only too pleased to help if I can. The words Easterner and Westerner mean nothing, really. If you spend time to get to know people... ...it soon becomes apparent that we're all just humans at the end of the day. Far more alike than most will admit.
Ryunosuke:
It would be wonderful if everybody saw it that way.
Mikotoba:
Sadly, not everybody can. We all have our failings, though. As I said, we're all human.
Ryunosuke:
(I see now why he's such a respected scholar. It's his magnanimous spirit.)
After clearing all Converse options:
Mikotoba:
Well...if you'll excuse me now. I need to telegram government ministers and the Japanese police with this information about Asa Shinn.
Susato:
Of course, Father. Thank you.
Mikotoba:
I look forward to next month's instalment, Miss Wilson.
Iris:
Oh good! And please, do come to Baker Street sometime, won't you? We'd love to entertain you!
Mikotoba:
I would be delighted. The best of luck for tomorrow, Naruhodo. And... ...give my suggestion your full consideration, won't you?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I will. (Going back home...?)
Susato:
You know, Kazuma-sama has always meant a great deal to my father. I'm sure he'd love the chance to meet with him and talk to him about all of this.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, no doubt...
???:
......... Asa Shinn... Of course! It's so obvious!
Sholmes:
How could I have neglected to consider the possibility before now?!
Ryunosuke:
Agh! M-Mr Sholmes!
Iris:
Hurley! Where have you been?
Sholmes:
Why, I joined you all for tea, of course. What an extraordinary question.
Susato:
I...didn't notice you at all.
Sholmes:
No matter, no matter! Anyway, to more pressing concerns. ...Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! ...Yes?
Sholmes:
I must dispatch a telegram to your country at once. It is a matter of much urgency.
Ryunosuke:
To...Japan, you mean?
Sholmes:
Tell me, to whom can I entrust the task? Quickly now! Who?
Susato:
Ah, well... ...my father has just now left to send a telegram to the Imperial Police Bureau of Japan himself.
Sholmes:
......... I see. Well, he looked reliable enough for a bearded fellow.
Susato:
...I don't think what Father sports could be considered a beard, Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
There's not a moment to lose! Kindly ask your trusty unshaven father to see this is sent!
Susato:
I, I will, but...what is it?
Sholmes:
No questions at this time, if you please, Miss Susato. All we can do is pray... ...that for once my deduction is awry.
Ryunosuke:
Doesn't that imply that your deductions are normally correct, Mr Sholmes? Which isn't exactly-
Sholmes:
Now then! You may be surprised to learn that I am a very busy man. I certainly have no time to hide behind settees and eavesdrop on other people's conversations.
Ryunosuke:
(So that's what 'joining us for tea' meant...)
Sholmes:
I leave the sending of this in your hands then, my dear fellows.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Wait a minute! Mr Sholmes!
Iris:
He just sort of ran off, didn't he? At quite a pace.
Ryunosuke:
And left the unpaid bill for his tea behind, too.
Susato:
I must catch up with Father at the telegraph office at once!
Iris:
And I'll run and call us a cab straight away!
Ryunosuke:
(And there was me thinking everyone would be clamouring to pay Mr Sholmes's bill...)
After clearing all Converse options in Great Waterloo Hotel Foyer:
2nd November
St Synner's Hospital, Ward 3
Susato:
This is the ward where Mr Vigil was brought, apparently.
Ryunosuke:
(To be frank, I'm a little worried about seeing him again.)
Vigil:
Ah. The lawyer. Hello again.
Susato:
Are, are you feeling better now, Mr Vigil?
Vigil:
Yes, thank you. Somewhat better.
Ryunosuke:
I'm so sorry to have caused you to... I mean, it was because of me. If I hadn't exposed your secret and forced you to remember things you'd obviously tried to forget...
Vigil:
......... The prosecutor was here until a few moments ago, too. You just missed him.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! (Kazuma beat us to it...)
Vigil:
He said much the same as you. He was very apologetic. But the truth is...I brought all this upon myself.
Ryunosuke:
Please, don't think like that...
Vigil:
Keeping it from Evie - my wife - all these years... I've carried such a sense of guilt. But that's not the worst of it. Over time...I obviously came to deceive myself as well.
Susato:
You mean...about your dismissal?
Vigil:
Looking back now... ...I'm beginning to think that perhaps Inspector Gregson didn't stumble across me by accident at all. I mean, he compensated me so generously for acting as his stand-in. He was clearly concerned for my wellbeing and... doing what he could to help.
Ryunosuke:
(So perhaps Gregson knew exactly what had become of Mr Vigil all along, then...)
Vigil:
I'm sure this is just deserts for ten years of lies and deception, but... ...it wasn't me that helped the Professor escape ten years ago! It wasn't me! I swear it! I swear it's true!
Susato:
Oh, Mr Vigil...
Ryunosuke:
I'm sure you'd rather not dredge up even more from your past at this time, but... ...if possible, could you tell us exactly what really happened?
Vigil:
......... I want to. I need to get all this off my chest. I just want someone to tell me what I should have done!
Examine
Notice on wall
Ryunosuke:
This notice caught my eye before, actually.
Susato:
I suppose it's some sort of slogan for the ward? A cheerful welcome message perhaps.
Ryunosuke:
Let's see... 'Pay with good cheer; leave with good cheer.' Well look at that! You were spot on, Miss Susato. It is full of 'cheer'.
Susato:
...I wonder how many discharged patients pay their medical bills with good cheer, though.
Ryunosuke:
......... Once I had to have a very painful injection when I fell ill with a cold. I felt awful already. So why did I have to suffer the sting of the injection as well as the bill? I yelled at the doctor.
Susato:
Oh dear...what terrible treatment.
Chart on left bed
Ryunosuke:
These must be the patient's treatment notes. Let's see... 'Tendency to jump from windows. Remember to place cushion at base of wall outside.' ...Aren't we a storey up from the ground here?
Susato:
Oh dear... Poor Mr Vigil.
Ryunosuke:
I can't help feeling that there's a better solution to the problem than a cushion, though... (Finding something you'd lost isn't always a happy experience, it turns out.) Pursuing the truth can be...a very dark business sometimes, can't it?
Susato:
Yes...I'm afraid it can.
Cabinet above left bed
Ryunosuke:
There are all sorts of medicines in this cabinet, look. I'm not sure if it's safe leaving them in reach of everyone like this.
Susato:
Yes, you're right. I can imagine if you were peckish, you might try some of the pills.
Ryunosuke:
...Well, at least there seems to be a little lock to secure the cabinet doors.
Susato:
I don't imagine that would stop you if you were hungry. I worry that you'd break the lock.
Ryunosuke:
...Hunger doesn't turn me into a criminal, you know, Miss Susato.
Chart on right bed
Ryunosuke:
Ah, patient treatment notes... What do these say, I wonder? 'Endlessly obliging.' I suppose that's referring to the patient in this bed.
Susato:
I would think so. And until Mr Vigil is a little more stable... ...it's probably just as well that he has a kindly person in the neighbouring bed.
Ryunosuke:
The 'endlessly' part is a little worrying though, isn't it? I mean, what if Mr Vigil suddenly declared that he'd like to take a trip out of the window? Would this endlessly obliging patient simply open it for him and say, 'Be my guest'?
Susato:
......... Let's check with the doctor later.
Crutches
Ryunosuke:
Ah look, a pair of crutches. Before we came to Britain, I hadn't realised they were used here as well.
Susato:
I imagine they were imported into Japan from Great Britain in the first place.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, so no one in all of Japan broke a leg before their arrival? Anyway, the sight of these things doesn't bring back good memories for me.
Susato:
Oh dear. Did you injure yourself once and need to use some?
Ryunosuke:
When I was little. I thought they looked fun, so I borrowed a pair to play with. But then I slipped and sprained my ankle.
Susato:
...I see.
Ryunosuke:
They contain powerful magic, those wooden staffs: the power to heal, and the power to harm!
Susato:
...I think a certain cheeky little boy managed to cause the harm all by himself.
Cabinet above right bed
Ryunosuke:
There are lots of bottles in that cabinet there, aren't there? Do you think it's safe to keep them there?
Susato:
Hee hee! If you were a patient here, I feel sure you'd take some medicine by mistake when you were half asleep!
Ryunosuke:
...That is a worry. But at least the cabinet has a lock, even if it's only a flimsy-looking one.
Susato:
Oh, I've no doubt you'd manage to unlock that somehow while you were half asleep as well.
Ryunosuke:
...There are limits even to what I can do when I'm half asleep, you know, Miss Susato.
Converse
Gregson's request
Vigil:
Inspector Gregson was obviously engaged in a special operation of some sort. He was investigating something that even Scotland Yard couldn't know about.
Ryunosuke:
(Details of the Reaper's marks, yes...)
Vigil:
It was when he had to carry out those investigations that I would take his identification and impersonate him.
Ryunosuke:
You'd pretend to be the inspector and carry out investigations on his behalf?
Vigil:
Oh no! Never! A common street pedlar couldn't possibly carry out a proper police investigation! All I would do is go to the specified location and make a little hoo-ha. Just something to leave an impression. So everyone there would think, 'A detective called Gregson was here.'
Susato:
So...that's what you were doing on the day prior to the incident?
Vigil:
Yes. He asked me to make an appearance at the park on Lime Street for the Red-Headed League event. So as usual, I flashed the inspector's identification around and was very vocal about my presence.
Iris:
But then you were taken prisoner! By those red-headed fraudsters.
Vigil:
Yes.
Ryunosuke:
So...you would always make a point of showing Gregson's identification and generally being loud?
Vigil:
That's what the inspector asked me to do, yes.
Iris:
Well that's one way of becoming a legendary detective, I suppose. ...Not a good one, though.
Vigil:
And as you know, I suffered this bruising around my neck at their hands. But the following day they kept their word and released me.
Ryunosuke:
Without returning the inspector's identification to you, however.
Vigil:
We had arranged to meet in the Fresno Street room at five that day so I could report back to the inspector. But at the agreed time, that's when I heard the gunshot.
The prison escape
Vigil:
It was at midnight on 17th June ten years ago. That was the time scheduled for the execution.
Ryunosuke:
But the Professor's execution never actually took place, did it?
Susato:
Or rather, the execution itself must have been used to effect the plan of escape. I hardly dare to imagine what a chilling plan it was...
Vigil:
Barclay was renowned for being the highest security prison in the country. Everything that went in or out of the place was searched multiple times. But...there was one notable exception. Or rather, one notable loophole. Something that was never questioned.
Ryunosuke:
I have a feeling I know what that loophole was now. The coffins into which the bodies of the executed convicts were placed, correct?
Vigil:
...Yes. Once the coroner had confirmed the death of a condemned convict... ...the body was taken in its coffin for immediate burial in Lowgate Cemetery just behind the prison. The chief warder first had to sign the necessary papers. And after that no member of staff was permitted to touch the coffin containing the body again.
Iris:
...!
Vigil:
When executions took place, only the executioner and the coroner were permitted inside the chamber. I would wait in the adjacent room for word that the condemned convict was dead. On that occasion, once I had that confirmation, I went into the mortuary to find a lone coffin, as usual. The procedure was that I would sign the paperwork having checked the coffin, then nail it shut. But for some reason that day, the coffin was already nailed shut.
Susato:
No!
Vigil:
I didn't think anything of it at the time. I assumed that my deputy must have checked the coffin and nailed it shut before I arrived.
Ryunosuke:
So...you mean...?! The coffin contained...
Vigil:
Yes. I can only imagine that Asogi, having escaped his execution somehow, was alive inside the coffin. The coffin was then taken out through the main gates and deposited in Lowgate Cemetery.
Susato:
Presumably there wouldn't have been enough air inside to breathe for long.
Ryunosuke:
So in the early hours following the burial, somebody dug up the coffin again to set Genshin free.
Susato:
But in the end... ...he was fatally shot in the graveyard anyway. What on earth really happened in Lowgate Cemetery that night, I wonder?
Vigil:
I'm afraid I really don't know. All I can say with certainty are two things: Asogi couldn't possibly have escaped that way without help from somebody working in the prison. And that somebody...was not me.
The convict, Asogi
Ryunosuke:
Obviously, you knew the man then? The Professor, I mean. Genshin Asogi.
Vigil:
Yes. I remember him well, in fact.
Ryunosuke:
Would you mind...telling us what you know?
Vigil:
Well, having been condemned to death as he was, any contact I had with the man was short, obviously. After that trial, which was carried out behind closed doors, attended only by elite members of the judiciary... ...they called for his execution to be carried out at the earliest possible opportunity.
Ryunosuke:
The outcome of the trial was set from the beginning, wasn't it?
Susato:
It was a time of delicate diplomacy, when Britain and Japan were in the process of signing an important treaty. That meant that this potentially destabilising case had to be dealt with swiftly and discreetly.
Vigil:
The man had less than a week in total. As I was the chief warder, I oversaw his short stay in the cells until his final hour. I remember being struck deeply by his noble character and incredible resilience.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean exactly?
Vigil:
He was a killer of many men, but he was always quiet and polite. He was a gentleman, and a man of intellect. In fact, I couldn't bring myself to believe what he'd done, so I asked him one day.
Vigil:
Those five members of the aristocracy whose lives were taken... Were you really responsible?
...I'm guilty of the unforgivable crime of ending another human's life, yes.
Vigil:
The following day, the closed trial took place. And the verdict was no surprise.
Ryunosuke:
Guilty.
Vigil:
That night, when he was brought back to his cell... ...I saw something. Something...unusual.
Ryunosuke:
Something unusual? What?
Vigil:
The last will and testament...of Genshin Asogi.
Asogi's will (appears after "The convict, Asogi")
Vigil:
As I said, it was on the night following his trial, after he'd been found guilty. I was doing the rounds of the cells, and when I looked into Asogi's... ...I noticed that he seemed to have a sheet of paper in his hand.
Ryunosuke:
Ah... (His last will and testament then, presumably.)
Vigil:
As soon as he noticed me, he hurriedly shoved it behind his back.
Susato:
But...why did you find that so unusual? Isn't it normal for a man to pen a will when he knows his death is nigh?
Vigil:
Yes, that's true. But there were special conditions to Asogi's incarceration, you see.
Ryunosuke:
What sort of conditions?
Vigil:
Well...even though he was held in a cell designed for condemned inmates... ...he was allowed to keep his personal effects with him, with one exception.
Ryunosuke:
Really? He was allowed his things? (That is unusual, certainly.)
Vigil:
Of course, he'd been convicted of killing five members of the aristocracy... ...but at the same time he was a guest in our country from the Empire of Japan. The powers that be were determined that his final days shouldn't be needlessly uncomfortable.
Susato:
And what was the exception you mentioned...to the personal effects he was allowed?
Vigil:
That's the point. He wasn't permitted to have writing utensils. Specifically, no pens or paper.
Susato:
So...he was prevented from leaving any written record of what had happened to him?
Vigil:
Yes, that was the long and the short of it. I've no idea where he obtained that paper. Any writing materials would have been confiscated from him upon his incarceration. As I said, he hid the paper behind his back and then he pleaded with me:
Vigil:
What did you just hide behind your back?
Please... Please, turn a blind eye. This...is my lifeline.
Vigil:
But...you know it's against the rules.
You're the only person who's seen. If you just agree to keep quiet...
Vigil:
Alright then. But what's on that paper?
...A last will and testament. This will...is the only weapon I have left now.
Ryunosuke:
(How can a will be a weapon?)
Vigil:
So I decided to pretend I'd seen nothing. And I let him keep his will. But then later... ...it just seemed to vanish without trace.
Ryunosuke:
What?! What do you mean, it vanished?
Susato:
It would seem that isn't the end of the story of this mysterious will.
Changes "The convict, Asogi" Converse option to "The will's disappearance"
The will's disappearance
Vigil:
I was the only person who saw Asogi's will, but...
Ryunosuke:
...But somehow it disappeared.
Vigil:
It was after Asogi's 'execution'.
Iris:
Which was actually an elaborate jailbreak!
Vigil:
The warders gathered up Asogi's possessions that were in his cell. They were all to be sent back to his family home in Japan, you see.
Susato:
To poor Kazuma-sama...
Ryunosuke:
And you're saying that it wasn't anywhere to be found among his personal effects? The will, I mean.
Vigil:
That's right. Though I didn't search through them myself. But Governor Caidin was livid. He was screaming, 'It cannae have disappeared completely!'
Susato:
That...doesn't quite make sense though, does it?
Ryunosuke:
In what way?
Susato:
Well, we'd understood that only Mr Vigil was aware of the will's existence. In which case, how did the prison governor know to look for it?
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes! You're right!
Vigil:
I really don't know how he knew. But it certainly seemed as though he knew of the will's existence from the outset. Only he didn't refer to it as a will. What he said was... ...the 'Asogi Papers'.
Ryunosuke:
The Asogi Papers...
Vigil:
I really can't tell you anything of the subsequent events. Because...well...of what happened.
Ryunosuke:
(Your dismissal...and the way you blocked it all from your memory...)
Vigil:
I'd forgotten all this until today. I don't suppose it's relevant to the case, though.
Ryunosuke:
Well anyway, thank you very much for sharing it with us, Mr Vigil. We're very grateful.
Present
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Mr Vigil, would you mind casting your eyes over this?
Vigil:
......... Ugh... My head... It's, it's throbbing...
Susato:
Oh no! It's too soon, Mr Naruhodo! It's too much for him!
Ryunosuke:
It's too much for me seeing him swoon like that. (Maybe I should lay off the evidence for a while...)
After clearing all Converse options:
Vigil:
I'm afraid there's really little more I can tell you. My wife Evie will be here shortly. So I do hope I don't appear rude, but...
Ryunosuke:
No no, not at all. Thank you again.
Susato:
But what will become of you now?
Vigil:
Well, impersonating a police officer is a criminal offence, of course. I imagine that once I'm fully recovered, I shall be arrested.
Ryunosuke:
......... I'm so sorry.
Vigil:
Don't be, please. This was all my own doing. I always knew that this day would come.
Ryunosuke:
Well...I wish you well. Goodbye, Mr Vigil.
Vigil:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Before you go! There's just one thing!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Y-Yes? What is it?
Vigil:
The Asogi Papers...
Ryunosuke:
...!
Vigil:
I'd be very grateful if you'd make no mention of the things I told you about them.
Ryunosuke:
...Presumably for some good reason?
Vigil:
......... It's my understanding that their very existence is a closely guarded secret. If it became known that I'd remembered... Well...it could be rather troublesome, I think.
Ryunosuke:
...I understand. (Some sort of will that Genshin Asogi penned just before his death. Which the man himself claimed was his last 'weapon'... I wonder... Perhaps it had something to do with his plan to escape...) If there's anyone who might know more about a document that Kazuma's father left behind...
Iris:
...It would be Mr Vigil's governor!
Susato:
Then we know precisely where we must go. Back to Barclay Prison!

Daley Vigil
Ryunosuke:
(Well...at least he seems to be on the mend.)
Susato:
You know... ...his disguise as Mr Gossip was really quite masterful, wasn't it?
Ryunosuke:
I can't remember anything about it except for the floppy lip.
Susato:
I imagine not even his wife would have recognised him.
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps. But did he really have to take it quite so far?
2nd November
Barclay Prison, Governor's Office
Caidin:
Och, back again, are you?
Ryunosuke:
Um, yes... Hello.
Caidin:
I've heard all aboot your investigations. I read the report just now. You've found him, eh? Vigil.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, luckily.
Caidin:
Well, anyhoo... ...the laddie does'nae work here no more. So your case is nowt to do wi' Barclay. I would'nae like you...to get the wrong idea aboot that.
Ryunosuke:
Of course, yes. Mr Vigil stopped working here ten years ago now, so...
Iris:
Yes, we've seen his dismissal notice, haven't we? He was given the chop!
Caidin:
Aye, kimmer. You ken very well. So...how aboot a wee handcuff biscuit?
Iris:
Oh, they really are like little handcuffs! ...And as hard as irons, too!
Caidin:
So? What's brought you doon here the day?
Ryunosuke:
Well...there's something else we'd like to ask you about, actually.
Caidin:
Is that so?
Ryunosuke:
We believe there might have been a document that disappeared from Genshin Asogi's cell. I think it's been called the Asogi Papers or something?
Caidin:
......... Did I no say? Gregson's death is nowt to do wi' things that might have happened at Barclay. Leave the past in the past, laddie. Let's not footer aboot wi' irrelevant details.
Ryunosuke:
(His expression's changed completely. We're clearly onto something here.)

Ten-year-old legacy
Caidin:
That murderer's botched execution... And the whole miserable escape... They were Barclay's darkest hour, aye. A shocking embarrassment.
Ryunosuke:
Because the convict had a collaborator on the prison staff, you mean?
Caidin:
...Aye, for shame. The coroner who confirmed the death o' the man after his execution, Courtney Sithe. And my chief warder at the time, Vigil, who was in charge o' the whole affair.
Iris:
But Mr Vigil says he didn't know anything about it.
Caidin:
The rascal would'nae say otherwise, eh? ...More handcuffs?
Iris:
Oh! How could I say no? ...You can never have too much iron in your diet!
Susato:
When Mr Vigil was handed his dismissal notice as a result of what had happened... ...he was so despairing, he jumped out of your office window, didn't he?
Caidin:
I dinnae like to say, but that's just Vigil trying to get oot of it. Do you no think he would'nae have jumped from the shock of his crimes being exposed, eh? ...I do.
Ryunosuke:
(You would'nae say otherwise though, would you?)
Caidin:
Of course, I cannae shun all responsibility myself. I should'nae have let him deceive me. Actually, there's barely anybody that kens what went on at the time now. Wi' Gregson having been murdered, and Dr Sithe forbidden from having any visitors.
Ryunosuke:
(No visitors? Someone obviously doesn't want her giving anything away...)
Iris:
Well...we're not going home empty-handed!
Caidin:
And I would'nae dream of sending you packing wi' nowt, kimmer. Here...take a handcuff or two!
Iris:
Oh! Well it would be rude to say no! ...Wouldn't want to become anaemic!
Caidin:
I suppose...if there's anybody who might still ken aboot what happened back then... ...it'd be that lass from the forensic division. Maria Gorey.
Ryunosuke:
Maria...Gorey?
Caidin:
Aye, Sithe's daughter. She did'nae have no more. Just the one. But the wee bairn's followed in her mam's footsteps. You dinnae ever see her wi'out a scalpel in her hand.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
???:
Mama, what is this?
Ryunosuke:
...Agh! (Wh-Where did SHE spring from? And...did she just call the doctor, 'Mama'?)
Ryunosuke:
(Dr Sithe's daughter, Maria Gorey... We could do with talking to her...)
Gorey (appears after "Ten-year-old legacy")
Ryunosuke:
So...she's Dr Sithe's daughter, but her surname is Gorey?
Caidin:
Aye, there's some family history, I'm sure, but I dinnae ken the ins and oots of it. She grew up watching her mam working wi' the bodies of folk who'd died in strange circumstances... ...and decided to do the same wi' her own life. I cannae understand it myself.
Susato:
Perhaps she was driven by a deep respect for her mother...
Caidin:
Perhaps... Anyhoo, she was in charge of Gregson's autopsy, I believe.
Ryunosuke:
(Right. And the coroner responsible for this incomplete report...)
Caidin:
Someone told me once that the wee lassie always loved her mam's stories aboot cutting up bodies. There's even a rumour that she used to listen to the funeral march as a lullaby.
Susato:
Well then perhaps...her mother might have told her about the autopsy from the case ten years ago!
Caidin:
Aye, I'd say there's a fighting chance at least. After all, that was a life-changing case for all of us.
Ryunosuke:
(We really need to speak to Miss Gorey herself about this, I think.) Well...thank you very much.
Caidin:
I'm no happy aboot any part o' this. It took years for Londoners to finally forget the whole Professor business. Can you no gi' up on this, laddie? Stop asking pointless questions.
Ryunosuke:
...I'm sorry. I don't like dredging up these painful memories for everyone.
Caidin:
Can you no just stay away noo? Leave me alone and dinnae come back here, eh?
The Asogi Papers
Caidin:
How d'you come to ken aboot that, laddie? There's no many folk even here in the prison who've heard o' those papers.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...well... (I can't tell him Mr Vigil told me...)
Susato:
I'm afraid our sources must remain confidential, sir.
Caidin:
Hmph...
Ryunosuke:
We've been led to believe the papers are actually a last will and testament. Is that right? The Professor's... Or rather, Genshin Asogi's...
Caidin:
......... Aye, that's right. ...You're well informed, Jimmy.
Ryunosuke:
(Oh, is that the end of the silent treatment?) But then after the convict's execution, it mysteriously vanished from his cell, didn't it?
Caidin:
Havers, no! You're off at half-cock there. I think you did'nae quite get your facts straight. It was there in the cell, exactly where it should've been.
Ryunosuke:
Oh... (Not what we heard elsewhere...)
Caidin:
Let me just have a wee holk aroond in here. I'm sure I can find it... Aye, here ye are.

Caidin:
Of course, I cannae read a word of those Japanese squiggles. But I mind it says he leaves all his worldly possessions to his son back in his homeland.
Susato:
Yes, that's correct. That's the gist of it.
Ryunosuke:
So these...are the Asogi Papers?
Caidin:
Aye, of course they are! Papers written by Asogi, nae doubt aboot it. There's no mystery here, laddie. That's your lot! After all the stramash o' that slaister of an execution... ...we sent the man's possessions back to his clan in Japan... and that was the end of it!
Susato:
I think we ought to make a record of this, Mr Naruhodo. Just in case.
The Asogi Papers have been entered into the Court Record.
Caidin:
One thing afore you go on your way, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes?
Caidin:
Those papers are nowt to do wi' Gregson's death. I'd prefer it if you did'nae make no mention of them ootside this office. Or rather... ...I would'nae just prefer it. Consider it an order from the highest levels of oor government.

Sorry?

Ryunosuke:

Bottles or chalices
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks's fine collection of hallowed chalices and bottles, all neatly lined up.
Kazuma:
Yes, he's extremely particular about all that. He has a strict regime for everything from the storage of the casks to the bottling of their contents.
Ryunosuke:
Gosh, you must be having a really tough time of it being his apprentice.
Kazuma:
Actually, no.
Ryunosuke:
Oh?
Kazuma:
He's so particular about it all, he refuses to let anybody else touch any of it. So it's been quite easy for me, in fact.
Ryunosuke:
(...Talk about weird.)
Desk near window or chessboard
Ryunosuke:
There's Lord van Zieks's incredibly stylish desk.
Kazuma:
It's not my style, though.
Ryunosuke:
No, I notice you've been working at the little table on the floor, kneeling down seiza-style. I thought it was some kind of punishment set up by Lord van Zieks when I first saw it.
Kazuma:
I find it the most comfortable way to work.
Ryunosuke:
I can't do it. After a couple of minutes of sitting with my legs folded under me, they start to go tingly.
Kazuma:
Don't exaggerate, Ryunosuke. ...We both know you can't even manage a minute.
Portrait

Do you know who the man in the portrait is?
Kazuma:
Why would I?

What?! But you're Lord van Zieks's apprentice!
Kazuma:
Yes, apprentice, not friend. And during the time I was suffering from amnesia, I didn't even notice that picture.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...really? (I mean, it's not the smallest picture...)
Kazuma:
I wouldn't have the first idea what the man decorates his office with.
Crime scene model
Ryunosuke:
Wh-What the...?
Kazuma:
It's a scale model of the crime scene.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, I realise that. ...Does the prosecution office make a model of the scene for every single case?
Kazuma:
Apparently so. Sometimes it helps to visualise things better and notice things you hadn't spotted before. Actually, the miniature noticeboard is my work.
Ryunosuke:
(Be honest...you enjoyed making that.)
Bats
Ryunosuke:
Wah!
Kazuma:
You disturbed the bats, did you? Fitting companions of Lord van Zieks, wouldn't you say?
Ryunosuke:
Actually... ...I've seen things flying in Lord Stronghart's office, too. Doves, I think.
Kazuma:
Perhaps you have to like birds to attain rank in the judiciary here... Although bats aren't birds, of course.

Kazuma:
What's that supposed to mean?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Nothing. Sorry. Just thinking out loud...

They're arranged according to vintage, flavour and region. Every week, they're all taken out and put back in order.
Ryunosuke:
What?! Every week?
Kazuma:
Lord van Zieks can't seem to settle on the perfect way of arranging them, you see. Vintage, flavour and region don't neatly coincide, that's the trouble.
Ryunosuke:
Gosh, being his apprentice must be a real challenge.
Kazuma:
Actually, no.

Your disappearance
Ryunosuke:
It's getting on for a year now. Since what happened on the SS Burya. (We were heading across the oceans from Japan to Great Britain... ...when a bizarre serious [sic] of coincidences led to those tragic events.) I thought...I'd lost my best friend forever.
Kazuma:
...I must have been unconscious for a long time. When I awoke, I was lying on a bed. It was a narrow little room. There was a posy of flowers by the pillow. It took me a little while to realise that I was in the cabin of a ship. I slipped out of the room and headed up onto the deck.
Ryunosuke:
Were you already suffering from amnesia at that point?
Kazuma:
Yes. I didn't know what had happened or where I was. There was just this voice in my head.
You have something you have to do. Something no one else can know about. Go to Great Britain. Your task awaits you there...
Kazuma:
It was a calling I couldn't ignore. It compelled me relentlessly. Out on deck, I saw that I was on a huge steamship and we were docked in a large port.
Susato:
It must have been Hong Kong!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it must have been. Presumably just before they were due to carry your 'body' off the ship.
Kazuma:
I had no idea of the situation. But I did have the feeling that this was in some way my last chance. So I concealed myself among the disembarking passengers and went ashore. Then I disappeared into the crowded streets of that foreign port city... ...so I could plan my onward journey to Great Britain.
Changes "Your disappearance" Converse option to "Your journey to Britain"
Your journey to Britain
Kazuma:
Just under a year ago, with all my past memories lost to me, I was left behind in Hong Kong. Everything was foreign to me. The sights, the sounds, the smells. My head reeled. I was truly at a loss. I realise now that I'd escaped as a dead man. With nothing but the clothes on my back. No money, of course.
Susato:
Oh, how terrifying for you...
Kazuma:
Luckily though, I had two feathers in my cap.
Ryunosuke:
One being your knowledge of English, I suppose?
Kazuma:
That's right. And on the back of that, I was able to pick up some work as a deck hand on a cargo ship. Eventually, after calling at countless ports, I finally arrived at Dover. That must have been some three months ago now.
Ryunosuke:
...Your formidable tenacity of purpose showing itself again. (I mean, the man had lost his memory and had literally nothing to his name... ...but he still managed to make his way to London on the opposite side of the world.)
Kazuma:
Of course, I had no idea why I'd moved heaven and earth to get here at that point.
Ryunosuke:
So...how did you end up becoming Lord van Zieks's apprentice, then?
Kazuma:
That...can only be called an extraordinary stroke of luck really. You see, I was stopped at the border because I had no papers. They took me straight to Scotland Yard. And by sheer coincidence, Lord Stronghart was there to attend a meeting. That's when the second feather in my cap came into play.
Susato:
Would that have been your knowledge of the law?
Kazuma:
Yes, exactly. Lord Stronghart was curious about an Easterner with intimate knowledge of British law. He took me back with him to the Supreme Court and assigned me to the Prosecutor's Office.
Ryunosuke:
And then, nine days ago... ...you finally got your memory back after the trial involving Drebber.
Kazuma:
Yes...I did.
Your father, Genshin
Ryunosuke:
Ever since I first met you at Yumei, you talked about your dream.
Kazuma:
Mark my words, Ryunosuke. I'll be chosen as a visiting student, and make my way to Great Britain someday.
Ryunosuke:
Did you know the entire time? About what happened to your father here?
Kazuma:
......... Sixteen years ago... ...when my father left on that exciting trip to Great Britain, I was just a boy. We took a photograph together the day before his departure. ...It's my last memory of him. But what I remember most about my father...is his unswerving sense of justice. Six years after he left, a gentleman called at our family home. He told me that Genshin - my father - had been taken ill in England and passed away. It was Professor Mikotoba. Your father, Susato-san.
Susato:
Oh my!
Kazuma:
Ever since then, the professor was very good to me. He even helped to fund my university education at Yumei. I'll be forever in his debt. But nevertheless...I just couldn't bring myself to believe what he'd told me.
Susato:
Oh...
Kazuma:
Then one day, a letter arrived at our house from Britain. There was no indication of the sender, so I opened it assuming it was from an old acquaintance of my father. ......... What I read in that letter changed my entire life.
Ryunosuke:
What did it say?
Kazuma:
It said that my father had been a mass murderer, and the writer cursed the Asogi name.
Susato:
Oh no!
Kazuma:
As a result of that letter, I found out what had been hidden from me all those years.
Letter from Britain (appears after "Your father, Genshin")
Kazuma:
Presumably the letter was sent from a relative of one of the victims. If whoever it was had been a member of the judiciary, he could have been present at the closed trial. The letter revealed that my father had been sentenced to death. Executed for being a killer.
Ryunosuke:
I'm, I'm so sorry you had to find out that way...
Kazuma:
I imagine the British government did its very best to silence whoever sent that letter. But someone who knew the truth and couldn't bear the resentment was always going to be a problem.
Susato:
But still! It, it could have been written by anyone. Why would you believe such a thing?
Kazuma:
There was a newspaper cutting included with the letter. It was the first I'd ever heard of the Professor and his terrible killing spree.
Susato:
Well...what did my father have to say about the letter?
Kazuma:
...I couldn't bring myself to show it to him.
Ryunosuke:
What? Why not?
Kazuma:
Because he'd deliberately concealed the truth from me by telling me my father was taken by a fatal illness. That couldn't have been easy for him. And he'd done it out of consideration for my feelings. So instead...I showed the letter to Judge Jigoku.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, to the other visiting student...
Kazuma:
He faltered for the briefest of moments, but then he just laughed the letter off. But in that moment, I saw it on his face. He was undeniably shocked. Shaken momentarily, before recovering his poise.
Susato:
...!
Kazuma:
A year later, my bereaved mother succumbed to the strain of grief, and she too passed away. That's when I made up my mind. That one day...without fail... ...I would cross the seas to Britain and seek the truth for myself. The truth about my father, Genshin Asogi. And I wouldn't let anyone stand in my way!
Susato:
Oh, Kazuma-sama...
The Reaper's trial
Kazuma:
What we learnt today in court turned things completely on their head. It was an impressive piece of lawyering...Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks isn't the Reaper, you know. I almost don't want to believe it myself, but it turns out that Inspector Gregson himself, the victim, was...
Kazuma:
It's clear that the inspector was behind the Reaper's activity all along.
Ryunosuke:
Wha...? (You mean, you knew?!)
Kazuma:
The real question is, who's been giving orders to the inspector? ......... Yes, Barok van Zieks is the real Reaper.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
And I know that ten years ago, it was him... ...who decided my father must be a mass murderer and sent him to his grave!
Susato:
No! He was merely seeing that justice was done as the law dictates. He's not to blame.
Kazuma:
Ultimately, it's people who condemn people. The law is just a tool that they use to do it.
Susato:
...!
Kazuma:
And when a man condemns another, he must take responsibility for his actions. Of course he must. But I know for certain...that my father would never have taken another man's life.
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma...
Kazuma:
On the contrary, my father's life was taken... by the Reaper!

Ryunosuke:

So you keep hold of that. Besides, I'm a prosecutor now. That armband would have no meaning to me.

Red-Headed League Article
Ryunosuke:
I was shocked when I found out they were related to the case. The Red-Headed League, I mean.

Autopsy Report
Ryunosuke:
This came up in the trial, didn't it? As something a little dubious, I mean. The fact that no time of death was recorded on Inspector Gregson's autopsy report.
Kazuma:
Yes, there were some unexpected turns in the courtroom earlier. The suggestion you came up with certainly took everyone by surprise. The idea that the victim died the previous day at some other location is quite something.
Ryunosuke:
Well, considering when the pocket watch had stopped and the scorch marks on the candle... ...it's certainly a distinct possibility. The evidence and the scene both point to it.
Kazuma:
......... To be honest, it bothered me too. So I paid a visit to the autopsy room earlier. The coroner responsible wasn't there, but I got a name. It's Dr Gorey.
Susato:
Um, if it wouldn't trouble you, Kazuma-sama... ...we'd very much like to speak with the coroner, too!
Kazuma:
Of course. The last thing I want is for anything to be brushed under the carpet. Scotland Yard's autopsy laboratory is behind Lowgate Cemetery.
Ryunosuke:
Lowgate Ceme... By Barclay Prison, you mean?
Kazuma:
Ah, you know it, do you? The prison where my father was incarcerated... and robbed of his life.

Well...thank you. We'll pay a visit to the laboratory later today.

Kazuma:
There's only one place where defence lawyers and prosecutors should discuss evidence. The courtroom. So it seems you're still confused by the situation. ...That's what I make of it.
Ryunosuke:
(...I get the feeling my friend's always going to have the edge over me, isn't he?)
After clearing all Converse options and presenting Autopsy Report:
Kazuma:
Ryunosuke... I...want to thank you.
Ryunosuke:
What for?
Kazuma:
For this. You safeguarded the soul of the Asogi clan.
Ryunosuke:
Well, it is a famous sword that's been in your family for generations. My only slight regret is that I never got the chance to draw it before I returned it to you.
Kazuma:
Karuma is said to have been forged by a master swordsmith during the Sengoku warring states period. I come from a long lineage of warriors, many of whom were expert swordsmen.
Ryunosuke:
...Well then, you're a chip off the old block, I'd say.
Kazuma:
This blade - Karuma - is the symbol of the Asogi clan's honour and might. Apparently, one of my father's apprentices even took the blade's name for a surname.
Ryunosuke:
Really? Karuma... It does sound formidable, that's for sure.
Kazuma:
Sixteen years ago, when my father was a visiting student here in London, he had this sword forever at his side. Which is why it means so much to me that I have it by my side again now too. And that...is all thanks to you.
Ryunosuke:
...It was an honour.
Kazuma:
Now...I have preparations to make for tomorrow. Perhaps I said a little too much.
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma, you've...changed.
Kazuma:
No, Ryunosuke, I haven't changed at all. It's you who's changed.
Ryunosuke:
......... I can completely understand your resentment of Lord van Zieks given what happened. But the fact is, those events and this case are, well...
Kazuma:
...Unrelated? Is that you want to say? How can you be so sure?
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Kazuma:
...Never mind. That man is the Reaper. And it's for that reason that the inspector was killed. I'm going to prove as much in court tomorrow... by whatever means necessary!
Ryunosuke:
I can't let you do that, Kazuma.
Kazuma:
......... I know you'll do what you have to as a lawyer. But I'm sure I don't need to tell you that I won't be taking any prisoners in the courtroom.
Ryunosuke:
...I would expect nothing less.
Kazuma:
Until tomorrow then...in the Old Bailey.
2nd November
Forensics Laboratory
If Forensics Laboratory is being visited for the first time
Leads to:
"This place...really is creepy, isn't it?"
If Forensics Laboratory has already been visited, after clearing all Converse options in Forensics Laboratory and Barclay Prison, Governor's Office
*Shink, shink, shink, shink*
Ryunosuke:
Someone's sharpening again...
Gorey:
You're still not dead? Anyway, I don't have anything more to tell you about that specimen.
Ryunosuke:
Actually, we're not here to ask you about Inspector Gregson. We were hoping to talk about your mother, Dr Sithe.
Gorey:
...!
Ryunosuke:
It's something the governor of Barclay Prison mentioned. He said that she was responsible for confirming the death of the Professor after his execution.
Leads to:
"........."
Ryunosuke:
This place...really is creepy, isn't it?
Iris:
Well...being a dead room, it's probably full of the spirits of the dissected.
Susato:
But actually...there's a rather pleasing scent of roses in the air!
Iris:
Well...being a dead room... ...the coroner probably needs a bold scent like that to mask the odour of death.
Ryunosuke:
Um, Iris... ...do you think we could change the subject?
*Shink, shink, shink, shink*
Susato:
Wh-What was that?
*Shink, shink, shink, shink*
Ryunosuke:
Ah... Erm... Dr Gorey?
Gorey:
What?
Ryunosuke:
Um...that noise before...
Gorey:
I was sharpening my tools. I'd be dead meat if I didn't keep a perfectly keen edge on them.
Ryunosuke:
R-Right...
Gorey:
When following the collagen fibres in the dermis, an expertly sharpened scalpel... ...cuts like cheese. Would you like a demonstration?
Iris:
Oh, yes please! I'd love to see!
Gorey:
Then...I think you'll do nicely.
Ryunosuke:
Huh?! N-No! No, I wouldn't do nicely at all! I mean...maybe some other time!
Gorey:
Tsk.
Ryunosuke:
(Was that a tut? Well...we came here to ask questions, so...)
Examine
Table or toolbox
Ryunosuke:
A table and a set of sharp tools... When you consider each in isolation, it all looks quite innocent. So why is it that when you put them side by side, they seem so horribly disturbing?
Susato:
...It might be best not to ponder it too deeply.
Gorey:
That's Mama's dissection table. It's too high for me, though.
Ryunosuke:
It, it is...?
Gorey:
If I fell from that height in my sleep, it would really hurt.
Susato:
Wha...?! You, you mean you sleep in here?
Gorey:
...Autopsy work is very involved. It's usually too late to think about going home when I'm finished. But I have bad dreams when I sleep here, and I always end up falling onto the floor. So I'd like to exchange that table for a lower one.
Ryunosuke:
...Maybe you should just go home.
Large jars on left shelf
Ryunosuke:
Those large jars seem to have pale things floating around inside them. I suppose they're fruit liquors or something. Or like the pickled umeboshi plums we make back home.
Susato:
...Yes, let's assume they're something completely innocent like that!
Gorey:
Ah, that jar you're looking at up there contains monkey brains.
Susato:
Oh my...
Gorey:
The composition is similar to the human brain, so they make for interesting study material. And in the next jar along, we have monkey-
Ryunosuke:
No no no! No more monkey anythings! ...Please.
Gorey:
...If you say so.
Susato:
Oh dear... The time when I still thought it was just some pickled umeboshi plums seems so long ago already...
Cabinet
Ryunosuke:
Look at all the bottles on the shelves in these cabinets! What an assortment of chemicals!
Susato:
These ones here are labelled 'Highly Toxic'.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh, that's worrying. Because there are also things that look like salt and pepper shakers in there.
Susato:
Oh yes! And they actually say 'salt' and 'pepper' on them! The doctor probably spends a lot of time in this room, I suppose. Perhaps she has meals here sometimes.
Ryunosuke:
Life goes on...even when you're surrounded by death...
Desk
Ryunosuke:
This looks...different to before.
Susato:
Of course, Mr Naruhodo. Miss Gorey is a young maiden. She has all sorts of charming little dolls and the like around her place of work, look.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes, you're right. Perhaps she's not so strange after all.
Gorey:
...They're how I practise.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gorey:
Mama always says that operations and dissections require speed and accuracy. So I take out my needle and thread and stitch three new dolls every day.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...right...
Gorey:
I used to make livers or kidneys or intestines... ...but Mama told me to make something more friendly instead.
Susato:
......... That's...quite different to what I'd imagined.
Display case with human skeleton
Ryunosuke:
Well, look at this! What a magnificent display case! The cherry wood has been polished to a high sheen, and the intricate carving is a joy to behold. Western cabinet makers really are very skilled, aren't they?
Gorey:
It's ten people.
Ryunosuke:
Pardon?
Gorey:
It's made from the bones of ten different people, all mixed together. Some of my best work!
Ryunosuke:
......... I was admiring the case, actually. The scary skeleton inside is...something I intend to ignore as best I can.
Gorey:
......... You're strange.
Susato:
...I wonder who is the strangest...
Owl or crow
Susato:
That looks like an owl and a crow up there.
Ryunosuke:
I know. And they haven't even twitched since we came in here...
Susato:
Well no, they wouldn't have. They're taxidermy mounts, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...I was afraid you were going to say that. I've been trying very hard to tell myself they're just sleeping with their eyes open.
Susato:
Yes, I think perhaps you were wise to put something like your daruma doll on display in the office instead...
Converse
Time of death
Ryunosuke:
Um, we have actually met before. I'm a lawyer, if you remember...
Gorey:
You're not dead yet...
Ryunosuke:
What?
Gorey:
...so Mama said I wasn't to cut you open. She's so strict about things like that.
Ryunosuke:
Well...good. (Dr Sithe has some scruples at least...)
Iris:
Oh dear... It looks like she's not interested in talking to us. For the time being, anyway.
Ryunosuke:
(For the time being? You mean...until we die? I hope that's a way off...)
Gorey:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Sorry, but...I wasn't planning on dying any time soon.
Gorey:
Tsk.
Ryunosuke:
(Surely there's some less drastic way of making her listen...)
Time of death (after presenting Autopsy Report)
Ryunosuke:
So...why doesn't this autopsy report include the victim's time of death then? It's really the most crucial detail.
Gorey:
I was told not to write it.
Ryunosuke:
What?! By whom?
Gorey:
Mael Stronghart. The Lord Chief Justice. He came here.
Ryunosuke:
Lord Stronghart came...?
Gorey:
He said that from the witness statements about the gunshot and the other evidence, it was obvious. The man clearly died at 5 p.m. on 1st November, when the gunshot was heard.
Susato:
But that's not the time of death you wrote on the report. You didn't write anything. Was there...some reason you didn't include it?!
Gorey:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Dr Gorey... ...if you're hiding something under Lord Stronghart's instructions... ...then sooner or later you're going to go the same way as your mother.
Gorey:
Give it here then.
Ryunosuke:
Hm? (What's she scribbling so furiously?)
Gorey:
There.
Ryunosuke:
You've, you've written...
What?! What's she written? Tell us!
Ryunosuke:
'Indeterminate'.
Iris:
But...
The details of the autopsy report have been updated in the Court Record.
Changes "Time of death" Converse option to "Indeterminate"
Indeterminate
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean by that? Why was the time of death indeterminate?
Gorey:
When the specimen was brought in, it was still fresh. So the time of death could easily have coincided with when the gunshot was heard. But...there was one small discrepancy.
Ryunosuke:
What discrepancy?
Gorey:
There was some fried fish in the pocket of the specimen's overcoat. And that fish...had started to rot.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Gorey:
If the victim liked fried fish, he presumably liked to eat it before it went off.
Ryunosuke:
Well...yes. What are you really trying to say?
Gorey:
It's possible that someone tried to manipulate the apparent time of death.
Ryunosuke:
Manipulate the...? Is that even possible to do?
Gorey:
Theoretically, if you were to chill the body in ice, you could delay the onset of putrefaction. And if the overcoat wasn't on the body at the time...
Ryunosuke:
...Then only the fish would have started to rot!
Gorey:
With today's science, it's not yet possible to determine if the body was chilled or not.
Ryunosuke:
(But today's science is advanced enough to let you freeze a corpse, it seems...)
Susato:
But surely... ...to chill a corpse like that would require an enormous electrical refrigerator. And I don't imagine many households in London are equipped with such a device.
Iris:
No, definitely not. But maybe in a factory? Or some other special places?
Susato:
I don't recall seeing any factories or suchlike on Fresno Street, though. I wonder...if the inspector's body had been chilled somehow... ...what might the actual time of death have been?
Gorey:
I couldn't say for sure. But at the most, it might have been a day earlier.
Ryunosuke:
No!
Susato:
In other words, it would corroborate your previous deduction, Mr Naruhodo. That Inspector Gregson was killed a day before his body was discovered, at a different location.
Ryunosuke:
...Did you inform Lord Stronghart of this possibility?
Gorey:
He simply said that there were no electrical refrigerators of that size in the vicinity.
Present
Autopsy Report
Ryunosuke:
Dr Gorey...we actually came here to ask you about this.
Gorey:
......... He was very good.
Ryunosuke:
Good? Sorry?
Gorey:
His skin didn't snag my blade once. And very little mess. His joints dislocated easily and his muscle tissue was a pleasure to work with.
Ryunosuke:
W-We can skip those details! But...there is one thing about the report that's caught my attention. You don't seem to have recorded a time of death.
Gorey:
...! ......... That's not my fault!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! (That made me jump.)
Susato:
Then please! Tell us what happened!
Autopsy Report (after Autopsy Report is updated in the Court Record)
Gorey:
......... I don't know why...
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? Don't know why what?
Gorey:
Why I couldn't write a time of death on that report. It's just...the Lord Chief Justice was so insistent. I couldn't bring myself to defy him. I'm...just like Mama. .........
Ryunosuke:
(It looks like she's as troubled by all of this as we are, in her own way.)
Photograph of the Victim
Ryunosuke:
About this photograph, Dr Gorey...
Gorey:
Who's that?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? It's, it's Inspector Gregson, of course! The victim of the case!
Gorey:
Ah, I see. I don't remember the faces. Internal organs, muscle tissue, bullet trauma... Those are things I remember.
Ryunosuke:
Well...please try to also remember that I don't want to know anything about all of that.
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Erm...could I ask your opinion about this?
Gorey:
......... Don't forget... ...you're responsible for putting my mama in jail. Why should I help you?
After clearing all Converse options, before clearing all Converse options in Barclay Prison, Governor's Office
Gorey:
If you don't mind, then...
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
*Shink, shink, shink, shink*
Ryunosuke:
(She's gone back to sharpening her blades.) Erm...
Gorey:
Not now. Or my baby here might start to rust.
Susato:
I think perhaps we'd better leave Dr Gorey alone.
Ryunosuke:
(Maybe we could try again later if we manage to find some more clues...)
Examine
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Let's have a closer look at this...
Gorey:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Then again, let's not. At least, not while she's armed.)
After clearing all Converse options in Forensics Laboratory, if all Converse options have been cleared in Barclay Prison, Governor's Office
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes, one other thing... It's something the governor of Barclay Prison told us. He said that your mother, Dr Sithe... ...was responsible for confirming the death of the Professor after his execution.
Gorey:
The Professor...
Ryunosuke:
Apparently you always enjoyed listening to your mother's stories about her work, so... ...we were wondering if you might know something about what happened ten years ago.
Leads to:
"........."
Gorey:
......... That's not all Mama did.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gorey:
My mama... ...carried out the autopsy of Klint van Zieks as well!
Ryunosuke:
What?! Really?! (The brother of Lord van Zieks. The Professor's final victim...)
Gorey:
The idea of carrying out an autopsy on a member of the aristocracy was completely unthinkable back then. But the detective in charge of the investigation insisted and it was miraculously authorized.
Susato:
That detective being Inspector Gregson, of course.
Ryunosuke:
(Quite an accomplishment for one man...)
Gorey:
That autopsy provided the vital clue needed to arrest the killer. And Mama was there for that historic event.
Ryunosuke:
(What does all this mean...?)
Gorey:
You know, that amazing autopsy happened right here in this very room. The Professor and Klint van Zieks... ...they both spent their final moments before their burial on that dissection table there. So this lab - Mama's lab - was instrumental in some of the country's most important events.
Ryunosuke:
(She really is proud of her mother.) I wonder if you'd tell us more about exactly what happened back then, Dr Gorey?
Gorey:
.........
Converse
Confirmation of death
Gorey:
The Professor's execution was Mama's first big case. She had to be in attendance at Barclay Prison's execution chamber... ...and sign the certificate to confirm the convict's death. Mama is the best coroner in the world, you know. I was...so proud of her.
Ryunosuke:
But the execution didn't actually take place.
Gorey:
No. And worse still, Mama actually helped with the jailbreak. ...I didn't want to know.
Susato:
Oh dear...  You found out recently, you mean?
Gorey:
I believed in her. In Mama. But... ...now I wonder if I'm starting down the same path as her.
Ryunosuke:
You mean, because you omitted the time of death on this autopsy report? But that's because Lord Stronghart forbade you from including it.
Gorey:
...Just like Mama. I'm sure she was coerced by somebody, too.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's my feeling as well.
Gorey:
There's no doubt that there were powerful forces at play ten years ago. The execution couldn't have been staged without a lot of people at the prison knowing about it. Obviously the prison governor must have been in on it as well.
Iris:
The big man with the little handcuffs? According to what he told us... ...he was tricked by the chief warder. He says he knew nothing about it.
Gorey:
Of course he said that. I'd say the same thing.
Ryunosuke:
(Just who was behind that jailbreak all those years ago?)
Klint's autopsy
Ryunosuke:
You mentioned the autopsy of Klint van Zieks...
Gorey:
It was at a time when carrying out autopsies of murder victims was very unusual.
Susato:
It's still not a practice that's observed in our country, even now.
Gorey:
It turned out that he was the Professor's final victim. And when the autopsy was performed... ...Mama was present...although only as the secondary assistant. The person leading the procedure was called Dr John H. Wilson.
Iris:
That's right. My daddy!
Gorey:
And there was one other person present: the primary assistant. He was a visiting student from the Far East.
Ryunosuke:
Wait...a visiting student?!
Susato:
It must have been my father...Yujin Mikotoba.
Ryunosuke:
(I had no idea Professor Mikotoba had been involved in something so important!)
Gorey:
But the outcome of that historic autopsy... ...was the discovery of a vital piece of evidence that led to the capture of the Professor!
Ryunosuke:
(So that's how they came to identify Genshin Asogi as the infamous mass murderer...) Do you happen to know anything about that piece of evidence? Can you tell us any more?
Gorey:
......... Would you like to see the records for yourself?
Ryunosuke:
Wha... Would, would that be alright?
Gorey:
What's the point of keeping records if people can't look at them? They're filed under 'V' at the back of those cupboards. With the other records from the last decade.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you! (Let's see... Van Zieks... Van Zieks...) Um...that's strange.
Susato:
What, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
They...aren't here. There's nothing under 'van Zieks.'
Gorey:
There must be!
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps somebody took them away?
Gorey:
No. No one's allowed to take documents related to the Professor case out of this room. ...But you're right. They're gone!
Ryunosuke:
Well, when was the last time somebody looked at them? Do you remember?
Gorey:
It was... Oh yes, I remember now! It was two years ago. A 'consulting detective' came one day saying that he'd like to see the records.
Ryunosuke:
No... You, you don't mean...?
Gorey:
Herlock Sholmes was his name.
Ryunosuke:
...! (Deep down, I knew that was coming.)
Gorey:
Do you think...he stole the records?
Susato:
Oh no, surely not! Iris, that can't be right...can it?
Iris:
.........
Ryunosuke:
I-Iris?
After clearing all Converse options:
Iris:
Um, Runo... ...I hope you don't mind, but...
Ryunosuke:
What is it, Iris?
Iris:
I've just remembered something very important I have to do. I'm going to have to leave you now!
Susato:
Oh! This is very sudden, Iris... Well, we'll come with you, then.
Iris:
Oh no! No no, there's no need! You and Runo can take your time here. Bye for now, then! Good luck!
Gorey:
Wait a minute, little girl.
Iris:
Hm? ...Me?
Gorey:
I remember now. You've been here before, haven't you?
Iris:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Have you, Iris?
Gorey:
Yes, two years ago. When that detective came... ...you were with him, weren't you? You were a living specimen then, too.
Ryunosuke:
(That's the way it usually works, yes...)
Iris:
Was I...? I, I really don't remember. Anyway, sorry, but I must dash!
Ryunosuke:
Wait, Iris...
Iris:
I'll brew up a pot for you when you get home!
Ryunosuke:
(What's the matter with her? She's behaving really strangely all of a sudden.)
Gorey:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Well, in that case, we won't keep you any longer, either.
Gorey:
......... It's been quite a while since I had any visitors. This was really fun! But next time you come, I'd prefer it if you were ready for dissection.
Ryunosuke:
...I can't make any promises, sorry. (It's a bit strange that the records of Klint van Zieks's autopsy have disappeared... ...but I think we've asked all we came to ask now.)
After clearing all Converse options in Forensics Laboratory:
2nd November
Room on Fresno Street
Ryunosuke:
The police are still busily investigating in here then.
Susato:
But Gina's nowhere to be seen. Where is she?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it has been blissfully quiet, hasn't it? (Perhaps she's out investigating on her own, practising what her boss taught her...)
Susato:
Well, I expect she'll be back before too long. Shall we wait?
Ryunosuke:
(Actually... ...there's something different about this room since the last time we were here, isn't there?)
Susato:
We could always use the time to investigate more thoroughly!
Examine
Trunk
Leads to:
"...This little trunk wasn't here before, was it?"
Portrait or desk
Ryunosuke:
The photograph of Mrs Vigil...
Susato:
Realising the identity of this lady was a very great clue to exposing Mr Gossip's true identity. He obviously loves his wife very dearly. ...Which is why he felt he couldn't tell her the truth.
Ryunosuke:
The transformation was incredible, wasn't it? Just from that big twisted lip.
Susato:
Yes, he went to extraordinary efforts to play the part of Hugh Boone convincingly.
Ryunosuke:
Although...it didn't really seem like it was much of an effort to me.
Susato:
Hm... Now you say it, I have to agree.
Ryunosuke:
It's almost as if that was Mr Vigil's true character.
Susato:
...People really are very hard to fathom at times.
Board
Ryunosuke:
There are details of cases stretching back over ten years on this noticeboard. Yes, a history of Lord van Zieks's defeats in court.
Susato:
I don't think that's an appropriate description. Although...when you consider everything on the board, it's certainly true... ...that all these people had a background of dubious dealings.
Ryunosuke:
And in the end of course... ...the board itself concealed the inspector's own death.
Susato:
Oh my... It really doesn't bear thinking about.
Gun
Ryunosuke:
This revolver... Just who does it belong to?
Susato:
Well, we know it's of the type issued to members of the police force and judiciary.
Ryunosuke:
But Gregson's own gun was found on his person.
Susato:
And of course Lord van Zieks has admitted to losing the firearm with which he was issued. Such absent-mindedness... Not dissimilar to you, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
......... I'm starting to think the cold, hard prosecutor and I could become friends after all.
Susato:
Then I wish you every success!
Red wig
Ryunosuke:
It catches your eye as soon as you enter the room, doesn't it?
Susato:
It's such a bright colour, it certainly makes an impression, yes.
Ryunosuke:
...They can't possibly commit any crimes, can they? I mean, red-heads stand out like a sore thumb.
Susato:
I'm afraid with our jet-black Japanese hair, we stand out almost as much, here in London.
Ryunosuke:
Haah... I suppose that's true.
Susato:
......... You mustn't think of committing any crimes, Mr Naruhodo. 
Ryunosuke:
I wasn't!
Chalk outline
Ryunosuke:
If it turns out that Gregson didn't actually die in here at all... ...where on earth could he have been killed?
Susato:
Well one way or another, we must find out. For the inspector's sake.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
You know, you look awfully pale again today, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...sorry. When I start thinking it all through, I conjure up some horrible images in my mind.
Susato:
Your imagination is the culprit here, then. Most certainly guilty!
Figurine
Ryunosuke:
I'd never have imagined that this little figurine would turn out to be a watch winding key.
Susato:
I suppose it's a policeman because the pocket watch was a gift from Scotland Yard. It seems there was much more to Inspector Gregson than we ever realised. He was clearly a brilliant man.
Ryunosuke:
It's the fish and chips that threw us off. I feel as though it ruined his image.
Susato:
I really don't think we should blame one of Britain's staple cuisines...
Ryunosuke:
But think about it. Imagine if it was Mr Sholmes. How would you feel if instead of that old briar pipe that's always in his hand, Mr Sholmes had a bag of chips?
Susato:
......... Rather disappointed, if I'm honest.
Ryunosuke:
Exactly.
Candles
Ryunosuke:
Using a candle as a timer device... Very ingenious, I must say.
Susato:
Yes, the culprit arranged it so that the firecracker would be set off at five o'clock, and then left.
Ryunosuke:
So that a loud bang was heard at precisely the moment Lord van Zieks arrived, yes. If only he hadn't picked up that gun from the floor...
Susato:
Something you probably told yourself once upon a time, I imagine?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I've learnt that lesson by bitter experience. I would have turned and run a mile for sure.
Susato:
...Which may not have done you any favours, either.
Ryunosuke:
...This little trunk wasn't here before, was it?
Susato:
Oh! ...It appears to be made of metal. It must be very heavy. I wonder to whom it belongs... There are some initials on the outside, look. 'T. G.'
Ryunosuke:
Let's ask one of the policemen if they know how it came to be here.
???:
Ooooooi! Wot d'ya think yer doin'?!
Gina:
That's my trunk, that is! 'Ands off!
Susato:
Gina!
Ryunosuke:
Wh-Where were you hiding?!
Gina:
I dunno, ya leave somefin' unattended for a few seconds, an' every Tom, Dick an' 'Arry's got 'is greedy eyes on it!
Ryunosuke:
Erm...just a wild guess, Gina, but...
Gina:
Wot? Spit it out, 'Oddo.
Ryunosuke:
Is it fair to say that you've only owned that trunk since this morning's trial?
Gina:
Wot?! W-Wot are you tryin' to say?! Come on, this trunk goes wiv me everywhere! Always 'as! Where've ya been the last year?!
Ryunosuke:
(Trying not to incur your wrath, mainly...)
Converse
Your boss
Gina:
You should 'ear them talkin' at the Yard now... They should be ashamed o' themselves. They're sayin'...that it was the boss who killed all them bludgers.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...you mean the whole Reaper thing?
Gina:
Yeah... Apparently the boss was investigatin' stuff that no one else at the Yard knew nuffin' about. Stuff to do wiv all them criminals wot got off scot-free.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the ones prosecuted by Lord van Zieks who used bribery and corruption to evade conviction.
Gina:
Well then obviously it was that bloomin' Reaper givin' the orders, weren't it?
Ryunosuke:
But...why would people be suspecting Inspector Gregson of being involved in the killings?
Gina:
There was a notebook 'idden in 'is office.
Ryunosuke:
Oh no... (This doesn't sound good...)
Gina:
It...'ad details about all the crimes that 'ave been pegged as the Reaper's work.
Ryunosuke:
WHAT?!
Susato:
No... Did you see it, Gina?! Did you see that notebook?!
Gina:
They wouldn't flamin' let me! Cos I'm 'just an apprentice' apparently! But it was me who found it! And 'e was my boss!
Susato:
That's right!
Gina:
I was pretty miffed about it, so... ...I sneaked a peek at wot it said anyway.
Susato:
Oh!
Ryunosuke:
(That's our Gina!)
The secret notebook (appears after "Your boss")
Ryunosuke:
So...you managed to see what was written in Gregson's secret notebook anyway, did you?
Gina:
Way I see it, it's my right to read wot 'e wrote.
Susato:
And what had he written, Gina?
Gina:
Dates, times, places, names... An 'ole long list of 'em. All details about the bludgers supposed to 'ave been done in by the Reaper.
Susato:
But...there could be an explanation for that! Perhaps it was a record of the inspector's investigations into the Reaper's activities.
Gina:
Exactly! That's wot I said! That's the first thing you'd think, right? As it 'appens, it was full o' names I recognised anyway.
Ryunosuke:
Well, the Reaper's targets were almost exclusively known leaders of London's criminal underworld.
Gina:
Well yeah, but...there was one name right at the end that was a bit odd.
Ryunosuke:
At the end of the list, you mean?
Gina:
I'm pretty sure the date against it was 31st October.
Susato:
Oh! The day before the inspector was found dead!
Ryunosuke:
So? What was the odd name?
Gina:
It weren't like a name I've ever seen before. It was somefin' like, erm... Nah, it's no good. I can't remember it. I don't think it was an English name, put it that way.
Susato:
Oh dear... What a pity.
Gina:
There was somefin' else, too. I dunno if it matters, but the same name kept comin' up over and over. 'Shinn' it was. Don't s'pose it means anyfin' but...
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
......... Did you say 'Shinn'?
Gina:
......... Eh?! Wot, it does mean somefin'?!
Ryunosuke:
(Lord van Zieks knew the name, too. He mentioned her as well. The woman who actually did the deeds... And now we find out her name appeared in Gregson's secret notebook...)
Your investigations
Ryunosuke:
We haven't seen you for a little while, have we, Gina...
Gina:
Well o' course not! I've been busy, ain't I? Investigatin' an' that. The lads at the Yard are tryin' to trace the boss's movements the day before it 'appened.
Ryunosuke:
The day before... That would be the undercover investigation into the Red-Headed League, then.
Gina:
Only the boss didn't go, did 'e? Ya found some cove wot was pretendin' to be 'im, didn't ya, 'Oddo?
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, it was Mr Vigil who actually went to the park on Lime Street that day, posing as Gregson.)
Gina:
Well anyway, you ain't the only one turnin' stuff up. I've got me own ways of gettin' results! When me an' me partner 'ere get together, there's nuffin' we can't track down!
Susato:
Oh, little Toby! He's such a faithful friend!
Ryunosuke:
So...have you tracked anything down, then?
Gina:
Wot d'ya think, eh? 'Course we 'ave! Can't tell you, though. Police business, innit?
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Gina:
Anyway, the point is, if you lot ever need any 'elp... ...you know who to turn to, right? Me an' the 'ellhound 'ere!
Ryunosuke:
Right... (Because he looks oh-so hellish, honest.)
Your investigations (subsequent times)

Ugh...
The hellhound (appears after "Your investigations")
Ryunosuke:
Um, Gina, about your 'hellhound' there...
Gina:
Chief Inspector Toby, you mean? 'E's the pride o' the force, 'e is!
Susato:
In Japanese, 'police dog' means something quite different, and not altogether nice to those involved in crime. But here in Britain, it's a wonderful compliment, it seems! For a canine, at least.
Ryunosuke:
It should be. After all, in the Great Exhibition case the other day... ...it was Toby here who managed to locate Drebber's workshop.
Gina:
Maybe it's time for another demonstration of wot this superdog can do, eh?
Ryunosuke:
(Do we have something the chief inspector could catch the scent of, I wonder...?)
Present Red Hairpiece, Policeman Figurine, Gregson's Pocket Watch, or Inspector's Identification

Ryunosuke:
Well, Chief Inspector Toby, if you wouldn't mind having a sniff of this...
Toby:
...! *Sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff* *Sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff*
Ryunosuke:
He...might be a little too keen, don't you think?
Toby:
...! Arooooooooo!
Gina:
AAAAAAAAAGH!
Ryunosuke:
(The chief inspector made short work of Gina there.)
Toby:
Woof!
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Look what he's gone to!
Susato:
Oh my! That trunk clearly still has a very strong scent... ...of Inspector Gregson!
Ryunosuke:
In other words... ...it must have belonged to him!
Gina:
......... Oh alright! It's a fair cop, I s'pose.
Ryunosuke:
And you nearly got away with it, too...
Susato:
You always talk so proudly of Chief Inspector Toby's nose and what it can achieve... Did it not cross your mind that he might identify something that was right next to us?
Gina:
Yeah...that was a bit of a bloomer, weren't it?
Ryunosuke:
That's enough now then, Gina!
Gina:
Eh?!
Ryunosuke:
I think it's time you told us the truth about that trunk!

The chief inspector said 'woof' to that, 'Oddo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...I heard.

I think perhaps...that particular item didn't excite him very much.

Gina:
It, it weren't like that! It, it just weren't!
Ryunosuke:
What are you talking about?
Gina:
I know wot's goin' through that 'ead of yours! But that ain't wot 'appened!
Ryunosuke:
Alright then...what DID happen?
Gina:
Well...like I said before, we were tryin' to trace the boss's movements. So I let Toby 'ere 'ave a whiff o' the boss's overcoat. And as soon as I done that, 'e went off like a shot... ...straight to that Sandwich.
Ryunosuke:
To a sandwich? Not to a bag of chips?
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! I believe Gina means the witness!
Ryunosuke:
(Oh, I forgot about THAT Sandwich...)
Gina:
Yeah, 'e 'ad it 'idden between them wooden boards of 'is! The boss's trunk!
Ryunosuke:
You mean, when they heard the sound like a gunshot and all piled in here...
Gina:
Exactly! 'E nabbed it from the scene!
Susato:
Goodness!
Gina:
Me and the chief inspector gave that Sandwich a good grillin', an' ya know wot 'e said?
Sandwich:
I, I thought it might fetch a g-good price, and the chap wouldn't be n-needing it any more, so... B-But that's all I did! Nothing more, n-n-nothing less!
Gina:
Would you Adam an' Eve the cheek of it, eh?! Stealin' the dead boss's stuff to flog!
Ryunosuke:
So Miss Venus wasn't the only one to meddle with the scene of the crime, then...
Susato:
How could they?!
Gina:
So anyway, that's 'ow it 'appened. An' it's a pretty decent trunk, so I figured I might as well make use of it. Is there summat wrong wiv that, eh? Well?
Ryunosuke:
...Maybe you and Mr Sandwich should try to find the answer to that question together.
Present
Armband
Ryunosuke:
You know that this armband is to show that you're a defence lawyer in Japan. Have I told you that?
Gina:
Yeah, defence lawyers... Whose side are you lot on anyway, eh? Tryin' to 'elp criminals get off the 'ook.
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks isn't the Reaper. I firmly believe that, which is why I offered to advocate for him.
Gina:
Yeah, but wot if yer wrong? Wot if 'e really is the Reaper?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Gina:
If it turns out 'e did do it, 'ow are you gonna feel then, eh?
Ryunosuke:
......... I have to believe in my client. It's all I can do.
Gina:

After clearing all Converse options:
Susato:
I think perhaps that trunk should be turned over to the police, don't you?
Gina:
Wot are you on about? I am the police!
Ryunosuke:
Gina...if you wouldn't mind... ...could we maybe examine it?
Gina:
Yeah, alright then. Do wot ya want wiv it.
Susato:
Thank you! We shall make a detailed record of our examination of the evidence.
Gregson's trunk has been entered into the Court Record.
Grrrrrr...
Examine evidence
Gregson's Trunk
Gash on side
Ryunosuke:
Have you seen this huge gash across the side of the trunk here? It's gone right through the leather and into the metal behind.
Susato:
Gosh, for a metal chest like this to have been so badly damaged... Whatever made the gash must have struck the side of the trunk with considerable force.
Ryunosuke:
(I wonder how it happened...)
Bloodstain on side
Ryunosuke:
Look at this dark stain here. Do you think...?
Susato:
Yes, I'm afraid so. I think it's blood.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh, I knew you were going to say that. So that presumably means...
Susato:
...That this was present at the scene when Inspector Gregson was killed. It's the most logical conclusion, yes.
Ryunosuke:
To think Gina's been carrying this around with her... (If you didn't know any better, I suppose it does look like a grease stain from all the fish and chips...)
Latch
Ryunosuke:
(Let's have a look inside...)
Piece of paper
Ryunosuke:
Look, there's something inside!
Susato:
Ooh, let's see... It appears to be a passport...authorising him to travel overseas.
Ryunosuke:
Was Inspector Gregson about to go on a trip abroad, then?
Susato:
Perhaps the date of departure might tell us something. That was... Oh!
Ryunosuke:
What is it?
Susato:
It was for travel on 31st October! Just one day before the incident!
Ryunosuke:
What? Really?!
The passport has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
(Gregson went to France the day before his body was discovered...?)

Metal fragment on side
Ryunosuke:
Do you see that? There's something stuck in the side of the trunk there. It's glinting.
Susato:
It looks like a fragment of metal of some sort. But it's wedged in so tightly, I can't remove it.
Ryunosuke:
Well don't cut yourself. You'd better leave it, I think.
Ryunosuke:
What's the matter with Toby? Why's he acting so aggressively towards me all of a sudden?
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, be careful! It must be the trunk!
Toby:
Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff!
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
*Thud!*
Gina:
Toby! Oi! Wot are you doin'?! Yer gonna lick 'is face off!

Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy
Susato:
Oh, Mr Naruhodo! Are you alright?
Ryunosuke:
...Miss Susato...
Sholmes:
Ah, conscious again at last. A blessed relief, my dear fellow! After all, to drop dead after a moderate licking by a small terrier... Most unseemly.
Susato:
What is or isn't seemly is irrelevant here, Mr Sholmes!
Susato:
I'm so glad there's no lasting damage. How are you feeling?
Ryunosuke:
I'm fine, thank you. Did...you bring me back here? (Ah! What's this on my head? A, a bandage?)
Sholmes:
Sadly we had no ice. So that's a compress of sugar water.
Ryunosuke:
Sugar water?
Susato:
Don't worry, Mr Naruhodo. It's a first-aid treatment that my father taught me.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...thank you.
Sholmes:
So, let us take tea when you're feeling up to it. But of course...no sugar in the patient's cup.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...the bump on my head is throbbing sweetly enough, don't worry.
Susato:
Hee hee. Whenever you feel ready, then...
Examine
Herlock Sholmes
Ryunosuke:
Um...thank you for your concern, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, think nothing of it. I must say I was quite startled... ...when I heard that you'd been attacked by a dog. For a moment, I feared that infamous murderer of so many had come back from the dead!
Ryunosuke:
...You mean, the Professor?
Sholmes:
Fortunately, I see your prized throat is unscathed. That stiff, turned-up collar of yours obviously afforded some welcome protection.
Ryunosuke:
(...Was I that close to death?) All I really remember is the dog licking my face over and over and over again...
Sholmes:
Well, if you wish to avoid such troubles in future, a little mustard spread on the cheeks should do the trick. I should think that would balance the sweetness of your bandage rather splendidly.

Gina Lestrade
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Gina, I'm...really sorry.
Gina:
It's daft, innit? If ya asked me a year ago, the cops could go 'ang for all I cared. But we've gotta 'ave police, ain't we? To catch the bludgers. So us divers can go about our business in peace.
Ryunosuke:
Wait...sorry? I, I don't think I can have heard that properly...
Gina:
'E said 'e was gonna teach me everyfin' I needed to know to be a detective. But all 'e got round to showin' me is where the best flamin' fish 'n' chip shops are!
Ryunosuke:
(Actually, that reminds me... Gregson said he was supposed to be going to Paris in the near future, didn't he?)
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Is something wrong?
Susato:
Oh...no. I'm sure I'm reading too much into things. It's just that the timing seems very coincidental.
Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Gina:
You know, the boss was actin' a bit strange recently. Like 'e was always in a rush...

Sholmes's Suite
Ryunosuke:
......... ...What on earth is going on in here? Am I having a bad dream?!
Sholmes:
Ah, no. It's an old German folk song. Rather a fine rendition, I think.
Ryunosuke:
...That's the least of my concerns.
Susato:
Um...Iris?
Iris:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Iris? What's the matter?
Iris:
.........
Susato:
Um...who is that sprawling-I mean, that...relaxed gentleman over there?
Iris:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Iris...? Um... (Is she even listening?)
Sholmes:
Excuse me, sir! I do apologise for troubling you whilst you're singing so merrily, but... ...would you be kind enough to explain the situation?
Ryunosuke:
...Well that worked.
Sholmes:
A crooning gentleman and a mute young girl... A rather tantalising juxtaposition. And one that appears to have incited the gods of deduction within me to find their voices, too.
Susato:
Ah! Mr Sholmes! Do you mean...?
Iris:
.........
Sholmes:
The strains of reasoning within me are playing now as a delightful duet. One melody sings of a reunion full of nostalgia.
Iris:
...!
Sholmes:
Whilst the other... ...is a morose theme about the great secret you're trying so desperately to conceal, Iris.
Iris:
...!
Ryunosuke:
(She's turned as white as a sheet.)
Susato:
So as usual, you've instantly seen to the very heart of the matter!
Sholmes:
And by the time my own brief performance is over, I feel sure this gentleman's song will reach its finale. So then...to music-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony! Pray, do enjoy Herlock Sholmes's latest 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!
The Great Deduction
The game is afoot!
Topic 1
Man's Identity
Sholmes:
Firstly, we consider the gentleman's nationality. Clearly he's a German with no grasp of the English language... ...as evidenced by the Germanic song he sings and his apparent inability to understand when asked to desist. So...why is the man here at all, and in such apparently high spirits? The answer of course, Iris...is clearly known to you. Indeed, we need only follow the gaze of those bright, young eyes to unravel that particular part of this mystery.
Iris:
...!
Sholmes:
The reason for the man's mildly irritating warbling is revealed by the herbal tea! You obviously offered our German guest a cup of your latest herbal blend. The tea's delectable flavour has made the man's spirits soar... ...and resulted in this joyful ditty tumbling incessantly from his lips. I eagerly await sampling the flavour myself, that I may join the fellow in his state of elation.
Iris:
Nnnnnn...
Sholmes:
Now to the next question: Who exactly is this gentleman availing himself so thoroughly of the settee?
Iris:
.........
Sholmes:
As it happens, a number of years ago now... ...a certain gentleman of German origin engaged my services in solving a particularly delicate case. He required the retrieval of letters once sent to an acquaintance, that might have proved...problematic. In order to conceal his noble identity, he also arrived at my office in a mask. The gentleman's name was Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein... ...the King of Germany.
Iris:
...!
Sholmes:
If my memory serves...the mask worn by this gentleman is identical. Yes, there can be no question! That mask belongs to the King of Germany! It would appear that His Majesty remembers the fine service I afforded him... ...and has decided to show his face again, mask and all, in order to express his gratitude. A well-mannered monarch indeed. Wouldn't you agree, my dear fellow? So the identity of this masked visitor is in fact my former client...the King of Germany! Indeed, his son is currently in London as well, enjoying the wonders of the Great Exhibition.

The King of Germany
Topic 2
Girl's Silence
Sholmes:
Which leaves us with one remaining imponderable. Yes...you, young Iris.
Iris:
.........
Sholmes:
But your apparently inexplicable silence...is unable to hide the truth.
Iris:
...!
Sholmes:
Yes, the reason for your muteness is concealed inside that knapsack! A five pound note, I believe. I must say, as your compatriot, I'm deeply saddened. It would appear that you've allowed yourself to be bribed into silence by His Royal Highness. Earning yourself some spending money in exchange for keeping quiet about the King's secret.
Iris:
Nnn...
Sholmes:
And now, the final piece of the puzzle... What is this secret you strive to hide with your silence, Iris? Ah, yes! We need only follow that brief, involuntary twitch of your eyes to find the answer. You were attempting to abscond with that coffee cup! My favourite coffee cup, in fact. Or should I say, the handle of my favourite coffee cup? It appears that His High-Spirited Highness broke it in the midst of his high jinks.
Iris:
Nnn...
Sholmes:
Which leads us to the sad truth... My favourite coffee cup has been broken by the King of Germany - and Iris, you tried to conceal it from me! ...I shall have a bill sent via governmental channels to the German royal family for its replacement.

Girl's Silence
Conclusion
To hide the coffee cup
Sholmes:
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction... of this painful puzzle...
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
.........
Sholmes:
With your silence as well, the fellow's jovial warbling rather rings in the ears, does it not?
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Susato:
Um, Mr Sholmes... ...I must say something does rather trouble me.
Sholmes:
Pray, Miss Susato, do tell.
Susato:
His Royal Highness... ...doesn't appear to have moved a muscle since we arrived.
Sholmes:
Ah.
Ryunosuke:
And you haven't said a word, either, Iris.
Iris:
.........
Ryunosuke:
If Mr Sholmes has it all right, you might as well own up to it now.
Iris:
.........
Sholmes:
...Your reasoning isn't entirely without substance, I must admit.
Ryunosuke:
And...one other thing, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
Yet another grievance, Mr Naruhodo? Surely not.
Ryunosuke:
Well, I actually read the story of that case recently. The one you were just describing. And according to that at least, it wasn't the King of Germany, it was the King of Bohemia.
Sholmes:
......... Goodness, was it?
Susato:
Yes, that's quite true. Master Gotts, the prince, testified to that in court. In his words, 'I have come to see the Great Exhibition all the way from my home in Bohemia.'
Sholmes:
......... I would ask you to keep that minor error to yourselves. ...It could easily become quite a scandal.
Susato:
I believe, Mr Naruhodo... ...that it's our turn now to make some corrections to a number of minor errors that may have slipped in.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, even Mr Sholmes is willing to admit he might be slightly wide of the mark this time. (Although it's clear that Iris is definitely hiding something. We need to find out the truth behind this mysterious scene!)
Sholmes:
But one truth is incontrovertible. My favourite coffee cup is no more... So...shall we embark again... ...on a joint presentation of Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'?
Course Correction
Hold it, Mr Sholmes!

Conclusion
The King of Germany
Sholmes:
Firstly, we consider the gentleman's nationality. Clearly he's a German with no grasp of the English language... ...as evidenced by the Germanic song he sings and his apparent inability to understand when asked to desist. So...why is the man here at all, and in such apparently high spirits? The answer of course, Iris...is clearly known to you. Indeed, we need only follow the gaze of those bright, young eyes to unravel that particular part of this mystery.
Iris:
...!
Sholmes:
The reason for the man's mildly irritating warbling is revealed by the herbal tea!
Ryunosuke:
So what, it's some mix of herbs that gives you the urge to sing?
Susato:
Goodness... I should like to try some.
Ryunosuke:
And I'd like to hear your singing, but this man... Just how long does he intend to keep up with that tune, do you suppose?
Susato:
As I said, he's been stock-still the entire time. And if you look closely... ...his lips aren't moving either.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Susato:
So I'm not sure what's actually responsible for the spirited singing. But I suspect the answer lies at the end of Iris's gaze.
Examine herbal tea
Ryunosuke:
Well, the cup's empty, that's for sure. So I suppose this mysterious gentleman must have drunk the contents.
Susato:
Iris's special blends are quite delicious, I agree. They always make my heart sing. So I can understand wanting to vocalise those feelings, certainly. In fact, Mr Naruhodo, you often erupt in boisterous laughter after drinking Iris's tea.
Ryunosuke:
(I do? Maybe I should take some lighter laughter lessons from Susato-san in the near future...)
Examine mask
Ryunosuke:
We, we know this mask!
Susato:
Oh! You're right!
Ryunosuke:
So...does that mean...? No, surely not! It couldn't be...could it?
Susato:
No, it's most definitely not him.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, no...of course it's not. ...Thank goodness. But then, why is this gentleman now wearing it?
Susato:
I'm afraid once again, I really have no idea.
Examine gramophone
Ryunosuke:
Wait, this...
Susato:
...Is a gramophone, still rarely seen in our own country.
.........
Susato:
The sound certainly appears to be coming from the horn.
Ryunosuke:
But machines singing! That, that can't be right!
Susato:
Science and technology are changing the world rapidly, Mr Naruhodo. What's right is changing, too.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...it's too much for my brain.
Susato:
Well, at least we've found our answer.
Present gramophone
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The reason for the man's mildly irritating warbling is revealed by the gramophone!"
Present herbal tea
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Who else could brew a tea so delicious that it makes you want to sing? And such a long and curious tune, too! Clearly this melody can only be... ...the famous Iris Wilson's 'Bohemian Rhapso-tea'! She really is the queen of blends.
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, that's true.
Sholmes:
As a logician, you will never surpass me. The science of deduction and analysis requires long and patient study. I'm several steps ahead of you. And your attempts to correct me serve only to highlight your deficiencies.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...this is what you get for agreeing with someone? ((I need to reconsider my answer, then...)
Leads to:
"The reason for the man's mildly irritating warbling is revealed by the herbal tea!"
Present mask
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
I've encountered somebody else whose behaviour became very strange indeed whilst wearing this. Because this particular mask...has some curious power to corrupt people's minds! Which is exactly what's happened to this gentleman!
Sholmes:
Then I would say this calls for a demonstration, my dear fellow.
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
Sholmes:
Pray, put on the mask and show us what peculiar things it makes YOU do! ...You have us on the edge of our seats!
Ryunosuke:
...Sorry, I'm far, far too shy.
Leads to:
"The reason for the man's mildly irritating warbling is revealed by the herbal tea!"
The reason for the man's mildly irritating warbling is revealed by the herbal tea!
Susato:
The song starts to get inside your head after a time, doesn't it? But...is he really singing it?
Ryunosuke:
You're right. And if you look closely... ...the man's mouth is open, but his lips aren't moving at all. The gentleman...couldn't be a waxwork, could he?
Susato:
One step at a time, Mr Naruhodo. Let's identify the source of the singing first.
Ryunosuke:
(...I thought that was an insightful suggestion.)
Ryunosuke:
The reason for the man's mildly irritating warbling is revealed by the gramophone!
Sholmes:
Indeed! For no well-bred gentleman would break into an obscure folk song when making a social call. In other words, this gentleman isn't singing at all. In fact... ...it would appear that the fellow is unconscious!
Iris:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Ah. The music seems to have stopped now.
Sholmes:
I ask you, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Yes?
Sholmes:
Why would I have purchased a recording of that gibberish?
Ryunosuke:
How should I know...?
Sholmes:
Well, never mind. On with the deduction! Who exactly is this gentleman availing himself so thoroughly of the settee?
Iris:
.........
Sholmes:
As it happens, a number of years ago now... ...a certain gentleman of German origin engaged my services in solving a particularly delicate case. He required the retrieval of letters once sent to an acquaintance, that might have proved...problematic. In order to conceal his noble identity, he also arrived at my office in a mask. The gentleman's name was Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein... ...the King of Germany.
Iris:
...!
Sholmes:
If my memory serves...the mask worn by this gentleman is identical. Yes, there can be no question! That mask belongs to the King of Germany!
Ryunosuke:
Although we've already established that it was actually the King of Bohemia.
Susato:
It seems Mr Sholmes intends to persist with his Germany theory for some reason.
Ryunosuke:
Come to think of it, the young prince was wearing a mask as well, wasn't he?
Susato:
Master Gotts? The young boy whom you had in tears?
Ryunosuke:
Don't remind me...or anyone else.
Susato:
Do you suppose all members of the aristocracy of mainland Europe wear masks?
Ryunosuke:
I'm sure they do. ...Well, probably, anyway. The point is, that mask doesn't belong to any king.
Susato:
No, that's right. As we well know. Because we can identify the true owner of this mask!
Present Kazuma Asogi profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Yes, there can be no question! That mask belongs to Kazuma Asogi!"
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Sholmes:
...Who?
Ryunosuke:
Ah! I, I just thought this might be the mask's true owner, but...
Sholmes:
Not as far as I'm aware. Now remind me, who are you again?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
I do my best to forget those who so spectacularly hamper my logic and reasoning. Make your exit, please! Leave the deduction limelight to those who deserve it, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
(I thought you'd forgotten my name...)
Leads to:
"Yes, there can be no question! That mask belongs to the King of Germany!"
Yes, there can be no question! That mask belongs to the King of Germany!
Susato:
We of all people should know that mask.
Ryunosuke:
That's right. After all, it's been here on the coffee table for some time now. Although how it came to be there, I really don't know, actually...
Susato:
Let's not worry about that little detail for now. The point is, we ought to be able to clear up the matter of who owns the mask very easily!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, there can be no question! That mask belongs to Kazuma Asogi!
Sholmes:
In other words! My memory is sublimely unreliable!
Ryunosuke:
...Only you could try to make that sound positive. Kazuma's mask has been languishing on this metal chest for several days. Though that doesn't explain why the gentleman is wearing it now...
Sholmes:
But it is now a simple matter to determine our guest's true identity. After all, the gentleman is unconscious. We need only excuse ourselves in advance, gently lift the mask and peer beneath it.
Ryunosuke:
......... I, I don't believe it...
Susato:
AAAAAAH! F...Fa... Father!
Iris:
...!
Sholmes:
I'm afraid, Miss Susato, you must be mista-
Susato:
No! ...I think not, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
Then it would appear our logic and reasoning has once again revealed the truth. This mysterious visitor...
Susato:
...Is my unconscious father...Yujin Mikotoba!
Ryunosuke:
Logic and reasoning? ...Or just looking and saying?

To hide the coffee cup
Sholmes:
Which leaves us with one remaining imponderable. Yes...you, young Iris.
Iris:
.........
Sholmes:
But your apparently inexplicable silence...is unable to hide the truth.
Iris:
...!
Sholmes:
Yes, the reason for your muteness is concealed inside that knapsack!
Ryunosuke:
So that's a five pound note poking out from Iris's knapsack, is it?
Susato:
Oh dear, I can't be sure. Most money that we encounter is in coin form.
Ryunosuke:
I know. I'm not even sure if we've seen any banknotes here in Britain at all, have we?
Susato:
But anyway! Father would never have paid money for Iris's silence!
Ryunosuke:
...He certainly seems like the silent type himself, though, judging by his present state. (There must be some other reason for Iris's silence, I suppose.)
Susato:
Perhaps what Iris is trying so hard not to give away with her eyes... ...is something entirely different!
Examine knapsack
Ryunosuke:
Now I think about it... ...Iris always wears that little bag on her back, doesn't she?
Susato:
Yes, that's right. Though it's easy to forget about it because you can't see it from the front. There are two little felt dolls attached to it as well.
Ryunosuke:
...Are there? I had no idea. I don't remember ever seeing them before. ......... Is it possible there's always a five pound note poking out from her bag that I just haven't noticed before, too?
Susato:
......... I couldn't say with absolute certainty, but I think... it's unlikely.
Examine Persian slipper
Ryunosuke:
This slipper features in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', doesn't it?
Susato:
It does! When I first saw it there on the mantelpiece, I very near fainted with excitement!
Ryunosuke:
Doesn't Iris keep her elevenses in there?
Susato:
...Yes, that part was never mentioned in the stories.
Ryunosuke:
We could swap it for the Japanese equivalent of a slipper for fun. In other words, for a wooden geta sandal.
Susato:
But then it wouldn't be possible to hide anything inside!
Ryunosuke:
(Which matters because...?)
Examine metal chest
Susato:
This metal chest? It contains important documents, doesn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Details of all the cases Mr Sholmes has worked on over the years... ...written up by Iris's father, if I'm remembering correctly. Iris insists that the chest is kept locked at all times. She's never once shown me inside.
Susato:
Well, its contents are invaluable to her, I suppose. And entirely irreplaceable. But look at it now... The catch is unlocked for once.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (So it is!) ......... That's hard to ignore.
Susato:
......... Very. I've never seen that chest unlocked before, in all the time we've been staying here at Baker Street.
Present metal chest
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Yes, the reason for your muteness is concealed inside that metal chest!"
Present knapsack
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the reason for Iris's silence can only be... ...hidden inside the bag she has on her back! It's a sizeable bag...for a sizeable secret!
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, that's true.
Sholmes:
As a logician, you will never surpass me. The science of deduction and analysis requires long and patient study. I'm several steps ahead of you. And your attempts to correct me serve only to highlight your deficiencies.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...this is what you get for agreeing with someone? ((I need to reconsider my answer, then...)
Leads to:
"Yes, the reason for your muteness is concealed inside that knapsack!"
Present Persian slipper
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Obviously the real reason for Iris's silence now is given away by this Persian slipper! The truth is, even though it's a famous item from one of your most famous mysteries, Mr Sholmes... ...Iris hasn't been treating it with the respect it deserves. She's secretly been hiding chocolates inside it!
Sholmes:
And I've secretly been eating them! A symbiosis that I'd thank you not to disturb, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
(...How have I ended up being the person at fault here?)
Leads to:
"Yes, the reason for your muteness is concealed inside that knapsack!"
Yes, the reason for your muteness is concealed inside that knapsack!
Ryunosuke:
If Iris is refusing to talk, it's surely because she's trying to hide something. So all this must be related to some secret she has.
Susato:
Well I certainly don't wish to force her into revealing something she'd rather keep to herself.
Ryunosuke:
But that might mean your father never opens his eyes again!
Susato:
...Don't you think that might be a little melodramatic?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the reason for your muteness is concealed inside that metal chest!
Sholmes:
An excellent observation. For upon closer inspection, there is something different about the chest's appearance. It's kept locked at all times, yet now...the catch is open.
Iris:
...!
Sholmes:
Evidently, this has something to do with your refusal to speak, Iris.
Iris:
Nnn...
Sholmes:
But it's a simple enough matter to incite you to speak, I'm sure.
Ryunosuke: [sic]
I merely need open this chest...
Sholmes:
Here we go...
Iris:
Nnnnnnnnn! NOOOOOO! Hurley, don't!
Ryunosuke:
M-MR SHOLMES!
Susato:
MR SHOLMES!
Iris:
HURLEY!
Ryunosuke:
......... He's dead...
Susato:
Never!
Iris:
Oh Hurley... I told you not to open it.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...so you've found your voice now, Iris.
Iris:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
In other words...what just happened clearly reveals the truth here. Yes, the real reason for your silence until now is...
Susato:
This is somewhat different to the usual 'dance of deduction' you perform with Mr Sholmes, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Well, he's left me alone on the ballroom floor, so I'm going to have to dance this next part solo. And anyway, I need to get to the bottom of this, for my own peace of mind. Now then...Iris isn't usually the silent type, so...
Susato:
You mean you don't actually know the answer yet? Despite that knowing point of the finger before.
Ryunosuke:
......... Miss Susato... ...sometimes a man needs to point his finger first and think later.
Susato:
Oh. Well...if you say so. I think we'd better examine Iris more closely and try to rescue the situation, then!
Examine skirt
Ryunosuke:
Iris always dresses in these frilly clothes, doesn't she?
Susato:
I've always thought this skirt is rather delightful.
Ryunosuke:
It's pretty sizeable with all those frills. Sizeable enough for a sizeable secret!
Susato:
...You seem to be rather fond of that idea. But you certainly can't go investigating further.
Ryunosuke:
(Does it look like that's what I was thinking?)
Examine knapsack
Ryunosuke:
For some reason, this knapsack is really standing out as suspicious to me today!
Susato:
Oh, is it?
Ryunosuke:
It's quite sizeable enough for a sizeable secret, that's what I say!
Susato:
Perhaps it is. But we certainly can't open it up to look inside without Iris's permission.
Ryunosuke:
...No...you're right. Who knows what might pop out and punch us?
Examine key
Ryunosuke:
That's a key she's holding, look. I'm sure that wasn't in her hands before, was it?
Susato:
No, you're quite right. It's appeared...as if by magic.
Ryunosuke:
That's strange... A big, old iron key... (Where did it materialise from?)
Present key
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Yes, the real reason for your silence until now is...that key behind your back!"
Present skirt
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Clearly the reason you've said nothing all this time, Iris, is because you're hiding something in your frilly skirt. And what sizeable frills they are...for a sizeable secret!
Susato:
A typical answer of yours, my dear fellow...being wide of the mark by a sizeable margin.
Ryunosuke:
M-Miss Susato, what are you...?
Susato:
Well, you've been left alone on the dance floor, as you say. So I'm trying to fill Mr Sholmes's shoes.
Ryunosuke:
Well...you've certainly captured the cutting sarcasm.
Susato:
Oh, of course! I nearly forgot...
Ryunosuke:
You really didn't need to capture that part, though.
Leads to:
"Yes, the real reason for your silence until now is..."
Present knapsack
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Clearly the reason you've said nothing all this time, Iris, is something to do with what's in your knapsack. It's a sizeable bag...for a sizeable secret!
Susato:
My dear fellow, you would appear to be rather caught up in that idea!
Ryunosuke:
M-Miss Susato, what are you...?
Susato:
Well, you've been left alone on the dance floor, as you say. So I'm trying to fill Mr Sholmes's shoes.
Ryunosuke:
Well, it's, um...very refreshing.
Susato:
Oh, but of course! I nearly forgot...
Ryunosuke:
You don't need to imitate every move, you know...
Leads to:
"Yes, the real reason for your silence until now is..."
Yes, the real reason for your silence until now is...
Susato:
How wonderful to hear Iris's voice again.
Ryunosuke:
It's just a shame it took Mr Sholmes being thrown across the room to make it happen.
Susato:
Oh, that gives me an idea... If we threw you across the room as well, she might talk some more!
Ryunosuke:
(...Iris made a sudden movement just before she spoke that's playing on my mind. I think we'd better have another good look around, whilst trying not to be too rude by staring at her.)
Susato:
Yes, do try to be sensitive, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the real reason for your silence until now is...that key behind your back!
Iris:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
When Mr Sholmes was thrown into the air before... Just before you called out to try to stop him, you slipped something out of your mouth. That 'something' is the key now in your hands. No doubt the key to the chest.
Iris:
You're so... You're so clever, Runo!
Ryunosuke:
So now it becomes clear. Thanks to Mr Sholmes's graphic demonstration... ...we can well imagined what happened here.
Iris:
B-But...
Ryunosuke:
Professor Mikotoba also opened that metal chest only to be punched into the air... ...and land sprawled on the settee.
Susato:
But, wait! That doesn't explain all the facts. What about the stylish scarf...and the cup of tea. And above all... ...why would he be wearing Kazuma-sama's mask?
Ryunosuke:
Well, for those curious details...I can think of only one explanation. Clearly an unbelievable miracle took place in this room. Isn't that right, Iris?
Iris:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Consider how the room was arranged before this whole painful experience took place. When Professor Mikotoba opened the chest, completely unaware of what awaited him inside... ...the mask was flung into the air just as he was, only to land neatly on his face when it fell back down. And the teacup's journey through the air ended when it caught on the unconscious professor's finger.
Susato:
You, you mean to say that the stylish scarf...
Ryunosuke:
...is actually just a tablecloth. This is the great detective's office, after all - a place of miraculous deductions. Would you expect anything less?
Iris:
......... Yes. You're right. It happened exactly as you said. ...Brilliant, Runo!
Ryunosuke:
Thus concludes Ryunosuke Naruhodo's great deduction... of this punchy puzzle!
Iris:
So then...why don't I make a fresh pot of tea for us all?
Sholmes:
Objection!
Sholmes:
An admirable performance, Mr Naruhodo. But in the final act of the show there, you rather missed everything of importance.
Ryunosuke:
M-Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
If you would cast your mind back to my earlier deduction... Iris...clearly you're hiding a great secret.
Iris:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
...She is...? (From the look on her face... ...Mr Sholmes must be right. Whatever that great secret is...the cat isn't out of the bag yet.)
Sholmes:
So I put it to you again... You were attempting to abscond with that coffee cup!
Susato:
It really is a shame about Mr Sholmes's cup.
Ryunosuke:
It must have been smashed when Professor Mikotoba opened the chest.
Susato:
Oh dear...so many things seem to have been broken here.
Ryunosuke:
But now that the deduction has taken a different direction... ...Iris doesn't seem to be trying to hide the broken cup any more.
Susato:
In other words, her great secret is something else.
Ryunosuke:
(Let's put our observational skills to work here one final time then...)
Examine coffee cup
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes's favourite cup...
Susato:
Or what's left of it. Just the handle.
Ryunosuke:
It was obviously hurled into the air along with Professor Mikotoba. If only it had been this cup that had caught on his finger before it hit the floor.
Susato:
Yes... But anyway, whatever Iris is trying to hide... ...it's clearly not this handle.
Examine case file
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Look! There, there seem to be more papers there... (Is Iris trying to hide them underneath the tray?)
Susato:
The, the insignia, Mr Naruhodo! It's an official Scotland Yard document!
Ryunosuke:
What? But...why would Iris have...?
Susato:
We must ask her!
Ryunosuke:
(An official Scotland Yard document...)
Examine knapsack
Ryunosuke:
Surely this time - at last - the knapsack is going to be the answer!
Susato:
...I'm really not sure why you're so intent on showing Iris's bag to be complicit in these events.
Ryunosuke:
Because! It's a sizeable bag, big enough for a sizeable-
Susato:
Big enough to carry things around, Mr Naruhodo! That's what bags are for.
Ryunosuke:
...So...the knapsack might never see the limelight, you mean?
Susato:
...I really wouldn't like to say.
Present case file
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"You were attempting to abscond with that case file!"
Present coffee cup
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it's Mr Sholmes's coffee cup. That's what Iris was trying to leave with, before anyone noticed it was broken. But she doesn't appear to be making any attempt to shield it from view.
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, that's true.
Sholmes:
As a logician, you will never surpass me. The science of deduction and analysis requires long and patient study. I'm several steps ahead of you. And your attempts to correct me serve only to highlight your deficiencies.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...this is what you get for agreeing with someone? ((I need to reconsider my answer, then...)
Leads to:
"You were attempting to abscond with that coffee cup!"
Present knapsack
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
If Iris was attempting to sneak away with something else, then she must be hiding it somewhere. And as far as I can tell... ...there's really nowhere else she could conceal anything but in that bag.
Sholmes:
Perhaps you'll allow me to offer an opinion here. As far as I can tell...much like that bag, your deduction doesn't hold water, my dear fellow.
Ryunosuke:
I wasn't suggesting she was trying to make off with a bag full of water.
Sholmes:
Indeed. That would be madness.
Leads to:
"You were attempting to abscond with that coffee cup!"
You were attempting to abscond with that coffee cup!
Ryunosuke:
We were very nearly taken in completely by Iris then, weren't we?
Susato:
It's rather charming that you could be deceived by a ten-year-old girl, I think.
Ryunosuke:
...I don't think it was only me.
Susato:
No, you're right.
Ryunosuke:
I think what Iris is hiding... ...must be extremely important somehow. Don't you?
Susato:
...Yes.
Ryunosuke:
(We're so close now! This great deduction is within our grasp, I'm sure!)
Ryunosuke:
You were attempting to abscond with that case file!
Sholmes:
Iris...as you know very well... ...nothing escapes the attention of a great detective!
Iris:
Oh no...
Ryunosuke:
We visited Scotland Yard's autopsy laboratory earlier today. And Dr Gorey informed us... ...that the autopsy report of Klint van Zieks had gone missing.
Sholmes:
Klint van Zieks... Hm, yes, I do seem to recall... ...that some years ago I asked to see the report in question. You were with me, weren't you, Iris?
Iris:
I... I...
Ryunosuke:
You mean...it...was you, Iris...? So those papers you have there are...?
Iris:
I'm sorry... FORGIVE MEEEEEEEEE!

Sholmes:
In truth... ...I would like to have thought I could have predicted the booby-trapped chest. But it caught me completely off guard. I was very nearly the 'late' consulting detective Herlock Sholmes.
Iris:
Ugh... I'm sorry, Hurley.
Ryunosuke:
So you mean, this autopsy report really is...
Iris:
Yes, I took it from the lab. Even though I knew it was very important.
Susato:
Was there something in it that troubled you, Iris?
Iris:
......... Not exactly something that troubled me. Something I'd been looking for. When I saw this report... When I saw the writing in it... ...I knew it was Daddy's.
Ryunosuke:
The, the writing...?
Susato:
Your father's writing? What do you really mean?
Iris:
.........
Ryunosuke:
...Iris? (It must be something that's hard for her to talk about.)
Sholmes:
Forgive me for interrupting, my dear fellows...
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes! What is it?
Sholmes:
I feel as though the poor unconscious gentleman on the settee has been somewhat forgotten.
Susato:
AAAH! F-Father!
Sholmes:
Perhaps we should find our guest somewhere more peaceful to rest? Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Yes?
Sholmes:
Would you be so kind as to lend him your bed? We must do our very best to make him comfortable, I feel.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, of course. I'll help you carry him up.
Susato:
So will I!
Sholmes:
No no, I can manage alone, thank you. You have tea to enjoy. We wouldn't want Iris's brew to stew.
Ryunosuke:
(...Because there's no better way to make the professor comfortable than dragging him upstairs like a trunk.) I wonder... (Perhaps that was deliberate. Maybe Mr Sholmes is making himself scarce to give Iris the chance to talk more freely...)
Susato:
We must use this opportunity to talk with Iris... ...and find out what's going on!
Converse
Your daddy
Ryunosuke:
Would you like to tell us about it, Iris? About your father.
Iris:
I'm sure I told you before, didn't I? That Daddy used to be Hurley's partner.
Susato:
Yes. And that notes about all the cases they solved together are kept inside that metal chest.
Iris:
That's right. Hurley told me, you see. He said that Daddy's somewhere far away now, so we can't meet.
Ryunosuke:
(That's one way of describing it.)
Iris:
Then, when I secretly unlocked the chest and read through the papers inside... ...I started to build up a picture in my head of what Daddy must be like.
Ryunosuke:
Well, that's only natural.
Susato:
You're just like any other girl of your age.
Iris:
I read that Daddy was a professor of medical science, so I studied and took my degree, too.
Ryunosuke:
W-Well, that's only natural...I suppose.
Susato:
In that respect, you're not quite like any other girl of your age, though.
Iris:
But...there was one thing that I could never find out. Daddy's name.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Iris:
His name wasn't anywhere on any of the notes that he'd made about his work with Hurley. But then one day...
Ryunosuke:
That's what happened, is it? When you saw this autopsy report, you finally managed to work it out. Is that right?
Iris:
Yes.
Ryunosuke:
(So it was the handwriting in the report that caught her eye.)
The autopsy report
Iris:
When I saw the writing on that report, I could hardly believe it. 'I know that handwriting,' I thought to myself.
Ryunosuke:
Because it was the same as the writing you'd seen on your father's case notes?
Iris:
Exactly. I was desperate to compare the two properly. I needed to see them side by side. I asked the doctor in the laboratory, but I was told I couldn't take the report away. And even worse, I was told that was the first and last time we'd be allowed even to look at it there.
Ryunosuke:
So you decided...to steal it.
Iris:
......... When I compared the autopsy report with the case notes I had here... ...there was no doubt. The handwriting was exactly the same. It was Daddy's.
Susato:
And the signature of the coroner at the bottom of the autopsy report...
Ryunosuke:
...Read 'Dr John H. Wilson'.
Iris:
So that's how I finally found out. I learnt Daddy's name at last.
Ryunosuke:
I see...
Iris:
Ever since then, I've called myself Iris Wilson. And that's also when I had the brilliant idea... ...of writing stories all about Daddy's exciting times with Hurley. I decided there and then that I'd write 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'!
Susato:
Oh, Iris... I had no idea the stories had quite such a deep personal significance for you.
Ryunosuke:
(I can see why the autopsy report was so important to her now. And why she was prepared to break the law to get her hands on it.)

I must apologise...Iris.
Iris:
...!
Sholmes:
This is really all my fault.
Iris:
Hurley...?
Sholmes:
I made a promise, you see. That until the time was right... ...I'd keep the details about your father a secret.
Iris:
I know... I've been very naughty. I'll take the autopsy report back to Dr Gorey and apologise, I promise!
Sholmes:
Yes...we'll go together, I think.
Susato:
Then...let me look after it for you until we get there.
Klint's autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.
Iris:
......... I must go and water my herbs, I think! I'll see you all later.
Ryunosuke:
(Poor Iris... She must be feeling awful. I know Mr Sholmes is here for her, but still...)
Susato:
Aaaaaah! Wha...? H-How...? What's the meaning of this, Mr Sholmes!
Ryunosuke:
...Mr Sholmes...?
Sholmes:
Oh dear me. So...you've noticed, I see.
Susato:
But... That, that would mean...
Ryunosuke:
What on earth's the matter, Miss Susato? You've turned as white as a sheet.
Susato:
It's this autopsy report, Mr Naruhodo. The one from ten years ago. The writing... ...isn't Dr Wilson's at all.
Ryunosuke:
Huh? Wh-What do you mean? How could you possibly know that?
Susato:
Because! I know this writing very well! This writing... It's my father's!
Ryunosuke:
Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! Professor Mikotoba's?!
Sholmes:
Indeed. It's true. And...now you know, my dear fellows!
Ryunosuke:
N-No! I don't know anything! What on earth does all of this mean, Mr Sholmes? (Because the idea that's slowly forming in my mind... ...it's just too extraordinary to believe!) Please! You have to explain!

The autopsy report writing
Ryunosuke:
So...this autopsy report was actually penned by Professor Mikotoba then? But that makes no sense! It's not possible, surely?
Sholmes:
Not possible? My dear fellow! Pray, take a deep breath and think again.
Susato:
Yes, you're right. In some ways... ...it actually makes a great deal of sense.
Ryunosuke:
It, it does?
Susato:
Ten years ago...is when Father returned to Japan after his extended study tour in Britain.
Sholmes:
And prior to his return, where was Dr Mikotoba engaged?
Ryunosuke:
Ah, of course! He was an assistant in Dr Wilson's laboratory, learning about forensic science.
Sholmes:
And as an assistant, he would have aided with the dissection work, making detailed notes... ...which would be assembled into the full autopsy report. Once the work was complete, the head coroner would check the contents and put his signature on the document.
Susato:
In other words, the only writing of Dr Wilson's in the report would be his signature at the end.
Ryunosuke:
I see... So Iris got the wrong end of the stick, you mean? She saw that, and assumed the whole report had been written by Dr John H. Wilson.
Susato:
Which is very understandable, of course.
Ryunosuke:

Your partner
Ryunosuke:
Thinking about it... ...most of what we know about you, Mr Sholmes, comes from the published stories of your exploits.
Susato:
Yes, 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' written by Iris.
Sholmes:
.........
Ryunosuke:
And we really have no way of knowing... ...what's fact and what's fiction.
Sholmes:
Most troubling for you, my dear fellow, I'm sure.
Ryunosuke:
So what about this supposed partner of yours? Did he really exist or not?
Sholmes:
Ah, you've come straight to the point, I see.
Susato:
...And please come straight to the answer!
Sholmes:
I believe Iris explained it in one of her instalments. He was a trusted comrade, and the only person I could truly have called a friend.
Susato:
And did this partner of yours truly make a record of all your cases? Are his notes really stored inside that metal chest?
Sholmes:
Absolutely, my dear madam. Absolutely.
Ryunosuke:
So...where's your partner now?
Sholmes:
......... We rarely meet. You see...he lives on the other side of the world.
Susato:
...!
Ryunosuke:
But if this autopsy report and the records of all your old cases were penned by the same hand... ...and if the autopsy report was written - though not signed - by your famous partner... ...there would be only one logical conclusion.
Sholmes:
Pray, impress me.
Ryunosuke:
Your partner would have to be Yujin Mikotoba. In other words...Miss Susato's father.
Sholmes:
......... 'Pon my word, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Yes?
Sholmes:
You are coming along wonderfully. You have hit upon the method at last! You've finally grasped the art of deduction!
Ryunosuke:
You, you mean to say...?
Sholmes:
Allow me to introduce you... ...to my great friend and partner...Mikotoba.
Ryunosuke:
P-Professor Mikotoba!

Sholmes and Mikotoba
Susato:
Does, does this mean... ...that you're the real Dr Wilson?!
Mikotoba:
No no no! My dear, I'm still my old self: Yujin Mikotoba, your father!
Susato:
Oh! Of, of course...
Ryunosuke:
(This is obviously too much for Susato-san to take in.)
Mikotoba:
I must say, though... ...how my old friend has attained world-wide celebrity as a great mystery-solver is the greatest mystery of all!
Sholmes:
I still remember the first time we met... Ah, pray remind me...when was it again, Mikotoba?
Mikotoba:
Sixteen years ago, Sholmes.
Sholmes:
Ah yes, quite! Sixteen years ago!
Mikotoba:
I'd just arrived from Japan with Seishiro and Genshin. I was in search of lodgings close to the hospital. Some comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.
Sholmes:
But rents are devilishly high in that particular area.
Mikotoba:
That's right. So I decided I needed someone to share lodgings and the expense... ...and was fortunate enough to be introduced to Sholmes who found himself in a similar situation.
Sholmes:
I was a callow fellow back then. A mere shadow of the great detective you see before you now. I was working at the hospital's chemical laboratory at the time, indulging my curiosities for little gain.
Mikotoba:
And the situation of our cohabitation led to us pursuing cases together, you see. Hard to believe it was a mere six years. We had a great many adventures.
Sholmes:
But in the last year of Mikotoba's stay in Britain, that most infamous of cases presented itself. The case with which you've become rather familiar yourselves: the Professor killings.
Mikotoba:
After the trial...Seishiro and I were summoned back home.
Ryunosuke:
Hardly surprising, given the circumstances.
Sholmes:
So there you have it. And as you know, all the details recorded by my trusty chronicler remain in that metal chest.
Ryunosuke:
(This is just amazing! Professor Mikotoba really IS Mr Sholmes's famous partner!)
Susato:
......... Father.
Mikotoba:
G-Goodness, my dear. What a cutting look!
Susato:
As your daughter, I'm very proud to learn that you were the great detective's great partner. But nevertheless... ...there's another mystery that I really must ask you to explain now.
Mikotoba:
And, and that is...?
Susato:
You know very well what it is. The unresolved matter of Iris's father!
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (Of course! I'd almost forgotten about that one!)
Mikotoba:
......... I should have seen this coming, I suppose...
Iris's father (appears after "Sholmes and Mikotoba")
Susato:
Iris told us... ...that all the notes about the great detective's adventures that are in that metal chest... ...were written by her father. Isn't that correct, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
That is indeed what I told young Iris.
Susato:
But if you're Mr Sholmes's partner, Father, and you wrote all those case notes... ...then Iris's father...must be you!
Mikotoba:
Ah!
Susato:
......... 'Pon my word, Miss Susato... You are coming along wonderfully as well. You, too, have hit upon the method at last! You've finally grasped the art of deduction!
Mikotoba:
Wha...!
Susato:
What you've always told me, Father... ...is that my mother died when I was born sixteen years ago. And you left me in Grandmother's care whilst you embarked on your study tour of Britain. And I've always accepted that. But... ...all this about Iris...
Ryunosuke:
(Ooh, there it is! Susato-san's ice-cold stare!)
Mikotoba:
No! Now hold on a minute! It, it was very complicated. I mean! It's, it's really not what you think!
Susato:
Then perhaps you'd like to explain exactly what it IS?
Ryunosuke:
(...There it is! Now the eyes go from ice-cold to red-hot, just before she...)
Mikotoba:
No really! You've, you've got the wrong end of the stick! Sholmes! Say something, man!

Red-Headed League Article
Sholmes:
'To the Red-Headed League'... The advertisement certainly draws one's attention, wouldn't you agree?
Ryunosuke:
It does. Although the best I could do to fit in would be some lipstick, I think.
Sholmes:
You should partake yourself, Mr Naruhodo! 'To the Caught Red-Handed League'... What do you think? As a defence lawyer, it could be an excellent way to net more clients.
Ryunosuke:
Yeees...I can think of two problems.
Sholmes:
Oh? Pray tell...
Ryunosuke:
Well firstly, all of these new clients would therefore be criminals. And secondly, I would have to pay each of them four pounds a week.
Sholmes:
Well, one gets nothing for free in this life, Mr Naruhodo. You should know that!
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Um, Mr Sholmes, about this...
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, without wishing to sound rude... ...I'm currently in the middle of a very important blink. Perhaps some other, more convenient time, hm?
Ryunosuke:
...Is there a set time for your 'important' blinks, or are they an all-day affair? Just so I know...

Sholmes:

Ryunosuke:
M-Mr Sholmes? (When did he get all dressed up?)
Sholmes:
Whilst I don't like to interrupt this exciting exploration of the past... ...Mikotoba and I have an urgent matter that requires a short excursion.
Susato:
But it's very late, Mr Sholmes. Where must you go?
Sholmes:
Why, my dear madam, is that not obvious? My partner and I must pursue our natural enemies! So, get your coat, Mikotoba! The game is afoot!
Mikotoba:
B-But, Sholmes. I really must give Susato a full explanation, I think.
Sholmes:
Later, my dear fellow, later. Our carriage awaits downstairs already.
Mikotoba:
......... You haven't changed one iota, have you? I mean really. I visit our home after ten long years... ...and when I open that chest in a fit of nostalgia, I quite inexplicably pass out. And as if that wasn't enough, when I eventually regain consciousness, I'm plunged straight into all this!
Susato:
Father, please...go with Mr Sholmes now.
Mikotoba:
Wha...?
Susato:
I've no doubt that whatever happened, you were acting in everyone's best interests. I trust you. Completely.
Mikotoba:
Susato...
Susato:
And sending the great detective and his great partner off on renewed adventures together... ...is more than I could have hoped for in my wildest dreams!
Mikotoba:
......... Very well, then. We'll speak again later.
Sholmes:
So...I believe your own work is done for the day. I wish you the best of luck for tomorrow.
Mikotoba:
Yes, Naruhodo. Good luck in battle. ...And in reaching a decision.
Ryunosuke:
(A decision? About whether to go back to Japan, I suppose...)
So much happened that day that I barely knew what to do with myself. It would only be later that I'd come to realise... ...how amidst the chaos I'd unleashed... ...were all the clues I needed to finally unearth the truth. And that all the turmoil was necessary... ...to give me the resolve to see everything through.
