District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Trucy:
Well, this is it!
Apollo:
Today's the day it all goes down. (And then there was yesterday...)
Daryan:
This meeting is over. ...Sorry.
Apollo:
Just give us five more minutes. We can call them back after that.
Daryan:
Sorry, no go. C'mon, piano-boy. We're leaving.
Trucy:
Daryan! Wait!
Daryan:
...I never liked you. Either of you.
Apollo:
Huh...?
Trucy:
Darn it! We were so close! He was about to tell us! Hey, Apollo...
Apollo:
(He didn't want us to hear what Machi had to say...)
Apollo:
(...And I think I know why. Time to bring down a little Justice!)
...BANG!...
Trucy:
Eeek!
Apollo:
Wh-What was that!?
???:
He is heard but unseen...
Trucy:
Who's that talking...?
Apollo:
...Valant Gramarye! (...Using the door like an average muggle, no less.)
Trucy:
You... aren't the witness today, are you, Uncle Valant?
Valant:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha! A preposterous proposition. How could I stand to stand upon the stand? Why, my secrets would be free for the plucking! ...I might even have to sign autographs! That is why I intend to remain hidden for the entire day.
Trucy:
Ooh, with vanishing magic!?
Valant:
Indeed! I will jump upon an express train, and express myself to the next town over! But before I go... a word of warning.
Trucy:
Warning...? What?
Valant:
A grand Gramarye glamour resides at the root of all that has happened. Do not forget this truth.
Apollo:
A... glamour?
Valant:
A spell, a sorcery... a great illusion! ...Miss Trucy, though it pains me to part so... ...I need to get in line for a ticket. Farewell!
Trucy:
And there he goes.
Apollo:
He sure seemed happy about that illusion thing...
Trucy:
Oh, big illusions are the bread and butter of a magician! You can't pull off a show without one! The big illusion is always a spectacle to remember! Usually, it involves cutting up things, like people or elephants... ...or the Eiffel Tower. Anything, really!
Apollo:
So he was talking about what we saw at the concert.
Trucy:
Lamiroir's disappearing act.
Apollo:
And Prosecutor Gavin's exploding guitar.
Trucy:
I wonder what he meant by it being at "the root of all that has happened"?
Apollo:
Well, it's about time. Shall we go?
Bailiff:
Ah, excuse me, sir.
Apollo:
Y-Yes?
Bailiff:
The scheduled starting time for the trial has been changed. The trial will not be commencing until 10:30 AM. Sorry for the inconvenience.
Apollo:
Huh? Did something happen? This is a first...
Bailiff:
It was by the judge's request. Some urgent personal business.
Apollo:
(Great. I bet he stayed up too late last night, watching courtroom dramas.)
Bailiff:
Apparently, he's visiting the hospital again.
Apollo:
The hospital?
Bailiff:
I believe it was mentioned that the Chief Justice's son is unwell. Apparently his condition worsened considerably this morning.
Apollo:
The Chief Justice's son...
Trucy:
Oh, that's right... Remember yesterday morning? The judge said he had to go visit him after the trial.
Bailiff:
There's an article about it in the newspaper. If you care to read about it yourself...
Newspaper Article added to the Court Record.
Apollo:
("Incuritis"...? Where have I heard that before?)
Trucy:
I'll let you read that article for us, Apollo! Just leave the TV guide page to me!
Apollo:
...Try not to lose the page with the funnies if you can.
July 10, 10:30 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
Ahem. My apologies for the delay. Court is now in session for the trial of... erm, how do you say this name again?
Klavier:
Machi Tobaye... our suspect fortissimo.
Judge:
...Right. It's his trial, in any case.
Apollo:
The defense is prepared, Your Honor.
Klavier:
The prosecution... is ready to rock.
Judge:
......
Apollo:
I-Is something wrong, Your Honor?
Judge:
No. Well, yes... It's just, I've been friends with the Chief Justice since we were students. It pains me to see him going through such a difficult time.
Trucy:
"Incuritis", was it? That article said there is no known cure!
Klavier:
Herr Judge, let me say, with all honesty, I feel your pain. But, now is not the time for tears. Now is the time... for law.
Judge:
...Indeed. We left off at quite the juncture yesterday.
Daryan:
I asked Interpol about that number. "IPXX314206"... The agent registered under this number... ...was Romein LeTouse.
Judge:
Thanks for looking into that for us, Detective Crescend. It's a great help.
Daryan:
Oh, no problem at all, Your Honor. ...I'll be heading out...
Hold it!
Lamiroir:
Wait! That voice just now... ............ It was him. I am sure of it.
Judge:
It was "him"?
Lamiroir:
That voice I heard, talking to Mr. LeTouse... when I heard the gunshots fired. It was him! It was Mr. Daryan!
Daryan:
...No way...
Klavier:
Quite a sensational ending. Who would have thought Daryan would guest star in the season cliff-hanger... as a suspect?
Judge:
I asked the prosecution to look into this matter. ...Please tell the court your findings.
Klavier:
Daryan Crescend is a member of my band, the Gavinners... ...He is also a detective, making the current charges serious indeed. Yet, after investigation, I have found no cause to alter our case, or file new charges.
Apollo:
...And your reason is?
Klavier:
Weren't you aware, Herr Forehead? He has an impeccable alibi.
Judge:
An alibi?
Klavier:
Let us review the facts again, shall we? The concert held on the night of the shooting was in three sets. The Gavinners ripped up the stage during the first set. For the second set, our guest took center stage... The only performers appearing were myself, Lamiroir, and Machi... ...along with a drummer and bassist, for a total of five. The shooting in the dressing room, however, took place during the third set. Lamiroir and the defendant, Machi Tobaye had left the stage at that point... ...and the Gavinners were already rocking. This is when two shots rang out at the scene of the crime. Shots heard by Detective Ema Skye, mind you.
Trucy:
And Apollo. You heard them too, right?
Apollo:
I sure did.
Klavier:
Furthermore, Lamiroir herself witnessed the moment of the crime... ...Well, perhaps I should say, she "heard" the moment of the crime. ...When she claims to have heard Mr. LeTouse and Detective Crescend "talking".
Judge:
B-But that's impossible! Detective Crescend was...
Klavier:
Precisely. Detective Crescend was on stage, getting his groove on, no less. Voila. A perfect alibi!
Judge:
Hmm. Does the defense have anything to add to this?
Apollo:
(It's true. When I heard those gunshots, he must have been on stage. Still, there's something here that doesn't quite add up...)
Judge:
...It appears the defense has no objections. I believe we can safely say that Daryan Crescend's alibi has been acknowledged.
Klavier:
Which means that Lamiroir was sadly mistaken. Her testimony cannot be true.
Judge:
Very well. Of course, if we disregard her testimony... ...then I see no evidence keeping us from declaring a verdict. ...If indeed, there are no objections?
Trucy:
Uh oh, Apollo! If he declares a verdict now...
Apollo:
(Ack! But Prosecutor Gavin's case is airtight! Lamiroir might have been lying to protect Machi! How can I rely on her testimony...? Wait... What about yesterday in the detention center...?)
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]........
Lamiroir:
"About the case..."? What about the case?
Apollo:
(He wants to tell us about Mr. LeTouse's death!?)
Machi:
[Borginese speaking], [Borginese speaking]....
???:
This meeting's over.
Trucy:
...Daryan?
Apollo:
(Machi was trying to tell us something, I know it! ...Maybe the best thing to do is ask him... under oath!)
Judge:
Very well. The court finds the defendant, er, what was his name again?
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor!!!
Judge:
No, that wasn't it. It was something like "marquis" or-- ...Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
Your Honor, before you declare a verdict, I would like to call another witness!
Klavier:
Exactly who else do you need to hear from?
Apollo:
A witness who, until now, has not been given a chance to speak in this court. ...Because he doesn't speak English.
Klavier:
You don't mean...
Apollo:
I do. The defense calls defendant Machi Tobaye to the stand!
Judge:
Wh-What!? But he doesn't speak English...
Apollo:
We'll use an interpreter!
Klavier:
Interpreter? I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere. I only speak a few phrases, such as, "I love you," and, "Where is the toilet?"
Apollo:
The defense would like to request Lamiroir as the interpreter.
Judge:
L-Lamiroir!? But there's a possibility she's protecting the defendant...!
Apollo:
But she'd be interpreting for the defendant! Why would she lie?
Judge:
This is most unusual...
Klavier:
Ah ha ha... Bravo, Herr Forehead. Herr Judge! The prosecution agrees with the defense's request. If Lamiroir lies, I'll be able to tell. Even my limited knowledge of the language should be enough for that.
Judge:
Well, if both prosecution and defense are for this, I see little cause for refusal.
Apollo:
(Finally! Some progress!)
Judge:
Bailiff! Please show the defendant and Lamiroir to the witness stand!
Klavier:
I suppose there is a first time for everything. Shall we proceed?
Klavier:
Your name, to begin with. ...If you would, Lamiroir.
Lamiroir:
Yes... He says, "Machi Tobaye, the defendant."
Judge:
Hmm, this is certainly a first for this courtroom. Not that we really needed an interpretation of that message in particular.
Apollo:
(So far, so good...)
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Justice, if you would.
Apollo:
Huh? If I would what, Your Honor?
Judge:
"Would what"!? You called the defendant to the stand, did you not? What would you have him testify about!?
Apollo:
What do I want him to testify about...? (Ack, I hadn't thought that far yet!)
Trucy:
Apollo! Aren't you going to ask him what he was about to tell us yesterday?
Apollo:
How can I if I don't know what he was saying...?
Lamiroir:
Excuse me, a moment. If I might speak?
Judge:
Yes, Lamiroir?
Lamiroir:
Just now, Machi said there is something about which he "wishes to testify".
Apollo:
(Machi wants to testify about something? What could it be?)
Judge:
What sort of testimony is he talking about?
Lamiroir:
...One moment, please.
Apollo:
(Argh! The suspense is killing me...)
Lamiroir:
What...!?
Apollo:
(What? What!?)
Judge:
W-Well, Lamiroir?
Lamiroir:
According to Machi... He has "proof of his innocence".
Judge:
Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaat!?
Klavier:
...This is a surprise.
Trucy:
Yahoo! Victory, Apollo! We did it!
Apollo:
(This is sounding too good to believe. And I know what that usually means...)
Judge:
Well, if that's true, then this is vital testimony! Lamiroir... I mean, Machi! Please testify to the court!
Lamiroir:
"Very well."
Witness Testimony
-- Proof of Innocence --
Lamiroir:
He says that word of Mr. LeTouse's death came as a great shock.
But if the killing truly followed the lyrics of my song...
...I, that is, he, could not have done it.
He says that because the lyrics are in English, he does not understand them.
Judge:
Hmm. I see! He wouldn't have understood the English lyrics to the song. That would prevent him from following them so closely.
Klavier:
I wondered what he meant by "proof". Why, he would only have to ask Lamiroir to know the meaning of that song.
Apollo:
Lamiroir! Did you ever explain the lyrics of that song to him?
Lamiroir:
I did tell him, generally, what the song was about. But never in so much detail. And he never asked.
Klavier:
Has my oft-repeated warning already fled that forehead? Lamiroir might be protecting the witness!
Apollo:
......
Judge:
Well, anyway, let us proceed with the cross-examination. Mr. Justice, if you would.
Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor. (Something's hidden in that testimony, I know it. I'll just have to trust my bracelet to tell me where! It worked yesterday, it'll work today!)
Cross Examination
-- Proof of Innocence --
Lamiroir:
He says that word of Mr. LeTouse's death came as a great shock.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Were Machi and Mr. LeTouse close?
Lamiroir:
Yes, after we traveled around the world on tour together...
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Lamiroir... This is Machi's cross-examination, not yours.
Lamiroir:
But I knew the answer...
Klavier:
This is a court of law. We'll play by the book.
Lamiroir:
...I understand.
Trucy:
When Prosecutor Gavin's tough, he's really tough!
Lamiroir:
Machi says he was very good friends with Mr. LeTouse. "Mr. LeTouse was always a gentle man, never angry.. We got along quite well. I never dreamed something like this would happen..."
Lamiroir:
But if the killing truly followed the lyrics of my song...
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
"The Guitar's Serenade", correct?
Lamiroir:
Yes. "The crime followed the lyrics of the song... The theft of the key ring, the burning guitar, and the bullet... This is why it could not have been me!"
Lamiroir:
...I, that is, he, could not have done it.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
By "could not have done it", you mean...?
Lamiroir:
It is very simple. Machi could not have done all the things that happened that day. For all those things followed the song lyrics closely...
Lamiroir:
He says that because the lyrics are in English, he does not understand them.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Wouldn't it be difficult for him to perform without knowing the meaning of the lyrics?
Lamiroir:
He did know what the song was about, its mood, shall we say. This was enough to play by. I told him it was a song about a "guitar in love".
Klavier:
It's... not actually the guitar that's in love, strictly speaking.
Lamiroir:
Oh? Perhaps I misunderstood!
Klavier:
Ah, no, not really. Yours is also a valid interpretation.
Apollo:
(Um... OK?)
Lamiroir:
No, it is my fault. I am too used to singing in Borginian. It is much easier than trying to understand these English lyrics.
Perceive Machi's glance on "are in English,"
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Apollo:
Machi... ...You can't fool my eyes.
Machi:
........!
Apollo:
You glanced toward her the very moment Lamiroir said the word "English". Why? And don't bother interpreting that! He understands me!
Lamiroir:
...!
Apollo:
Machi, tell the truth. You can understand English, can't you?
Lamiroir:
Wh-What are you saying? Of course he can't!
Lamiroir:
[Borginese speaking]....
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]....
Apollo:
(Must he continue this charade...?)
Lamiroir:
Mr. Justice, Machi says this: "I know the word 'English'."
Apollo:
Huh?
Lamiroir:
Before coming to this country, he heard me speaking English. He learned the name for this language, that is all.
Apollo:
What? Give me a break!
Lamiroir:
Is that such an unusual word to understand? Do you not know "Español", for instance?
Apollo:
(Well, yeah, but...)
Lamiroir:
I am sorry, but he truly does not understand your language.
Apollo:
W-Well then explain this! How does he know the crime followed the lyrics!?
Lamiroir:
...... Have you always been such a suspicious-minded lad? It is simple. So simple it hardly requires an explanation. ...He read about it in the newspaper.
Apollo:
The newspaper!?
Lamiroir:
The Borginian Daily Bugle. You can buy it in this country these days, you know. They have already begun to report about this case in our homeland.
Apollo:
...... (I was right!)
Lamiroir:
What is wrong, Mr. Justice? Your eyes, they are quite fierce all of a sudden!
Apollo:
(...Machi is lying! Maybe it's time to show them proof that he's lying!)
Present Borginian Newspaper
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I have here a Borginian Newspaper! The Borginian Daily Bugle, as a matter of fact!"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
This evidence proves that you're lying!
Lamiroir:
Ah, perhaps my interpretation was at fault...?
Lamiroir:
Machi says, "Try again, adhesive." No, no, sorry. "Try again, sucker."
Apollo:
(Urk! I must have gotten it wrong... One more time! So, he claims he read about it in the newspaper...? That means he's lying!)
Leads back to:
"Maybe it's time to show them proof that he's lying!"
Apollo:
I have here a Borginian Newspaper! The Borginian Daily Bugle, as a matter of fact!
Machi:
!
Apollo:
Indeed, there is a feature article about the case. Could you read this for me, Machi?
Machi:
....!
Apollo:
That's right. It doesn't mention the lyrics!
Lamiroir:
Wh-What? What is this all about?
Apollo:
I'm sorry Machi. You couldn't have read about the lyrics in a Borginian Newspaper!!!
Machi:
! ........................ [Borginese speaking]!!!!!!!!!
Judge:
What does this mean!?
Machi:
....................
Lamiroir:
B-But I don't see how it's possible... Ah, I know! He must have heard the lyrics when the police were doing their questioning! Yes...
Klavier:
Not possible, the subject of the lyrics was not brought up in police questioning. I read the full report myself.
Apollo:
So, the lyrics weren't in the newspaper and the police didn't mention them. The only place you could have heard them was in this courtroom! ...In English, no less!
Machi:
!
Judge:
The witness will explain herself... er, himself!
Lamiroir:
Machi says... He says... ......
Judge:
Yes?
Lamiroir:
..."It is true I read the newspaper. But this is not where I learned of the lyrics. I was mistaken. Now I remember..."
Apollo:
You remember...?
Lamiroir:
...He says he heard of the lyrics from me!
Apollo:
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaat!?
Judge:
Is this true, Lamiroir?
Lamiroir:
...... Yes. I'm afraid I had forgotten it myself.
Klavier:
Then it looks like Herr Forehead's been jumping to conclusions again.
Judge:
It seems so, yes.
Apollo:
(No... No! I was onto something, I know it! I can't let this chance slip away...!)
Judge:
Time is an issue today... Mr. Justice, are you finished with the cross-examination?
Trucy:
What are you going to do, Apollo!?
Apollo:
(If I'm going to keep on cross-examining, I'd better have an angle of attack... ...Or else!) ......! (My bracelet's still reacting!) Your Honor! Please allow me to continue!
Judge:
If you must, you must. Very well. Witness?
Lamiroir:
...I understand.
Changes statement from "He says that because the lyrics are in English, he does not understand them." to "He says that because the lyrics are in English, he does not fully understand them."
Adds statement "It was I who explained that the crime followed the song."
Lamiroir:
He says that because the lyrics are in English, he does not fully understand them.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Lamiroir:
It was I who explained that the crime followed the song.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Exactly how much did you explain to Machi?
Lamiroir:
...... Ah, this is a question for me, yes?
Apollo:
(This interpretation thing is getting old fast...)
Lamiroir:
I told him that Mr. LeTouse had been killed, and why he was a suspect. And I told him the crimes of that day followed my song.
Apollo:
Did you mention any particular words of the song relating to the case, such as "heart"?
Lamiroir:
Yes, of course I explained this. He was quite surprised.
Perceive Lamiroir's swallowing on "It was I who explained"
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Leads to:
"Lamiroir..."
Trucy:
Yay! I knew he was innocent!
Apollo:
I believe he is, too, Trucy. I do...
Trucy:
What's wrong, Apollo? You got a tummy ache or something?
Apollo:
(Something's hidden in that testimony... If it's the truth, I'll find it!)
Apollo:
Lamiroir... I'm currently cross-examining Machi. ...Why should you be uncertain?
Lamiroir:
! Me? Uncertain?
Apollo:
Yes, you swallowed the very moment you told the court... ..."It was I who explained."
Lamiroir:
...I see there is little point in trying to hide anything from you.
Apollo:
Lamiroir, are you, indeed, protecting someone?
Lamiroir:
That... is not a question with a simple answer. To tell the truth, I do not believe it myself.
Apollo:
Then, allow me to answer for you. Lamiroir, you're protecting...
Present Machi Tobaye profile
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Lamiroir, you are protecting Machi."
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Take that!
Lamiroir:
...I'm afraid I don't understand what you're saying.
Apollo:
Well...
Lamiroir:
So sad to go through life being so misunderstood.
Apollo:
(I don't need your pity! What I need is another chance. C'mon this is easy: Who is she protecting?)
Leads back to:
"Lamiroir, you're protecting..."
Apollo:
Lamiroir, you are protecting Machi. That's why you lied and told us that you had explained how the crime followed the song!
Lamiroir:
......
Apollo:
I don't fault you for trying to help, but this is not the way!
Lamiroir:
!
Apollo:
Machi! I believe you didn't do it, really! I trust you! But you've lied to us twice. And now you have Lamiroir lying on your behalf!
Machi:
................
Apollo:
If this is going to work, you have to trust me, too.
Machi:
!
Apollo:
Your two lies cover a simple truth. You understand English. You have to!
Machi:
! ........................ Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh!
Judge:
Witness! Is this true? Do you understand English?
Machi:
...Y-Yes. A little, only.
Judge:
What!?
Klavier:
First he could see, now he can talk. And you... did not know about this, Lamiroir?
Lamiroir:
I... no. I did not! It is quite a surprise.
Judge:
How many secrets is this witness hiding!?
Machi:
Last... This is... last...
Apollo:
Machi... could you tell us what really happened?
Machi:
No shooting! I did no shooting!
Apollo:
So, you weren't in the dressing room when I heard those two gunshots, correct?
Machi:
......
Klavier:
Apparently, the answer to that question isn't simple either.
Machi:
I was in... dressing room. Behind desk. Manager, he on floor...
Apollo:
(Which would be after the shooting, right...?)
Machi:
...Then, there is voice...
Trucy:
Voice? Or voices? Was it you and Ema, Apollo?
Apollo:
So when Machi went into the dressing room, Mr. LeTouse had already been shot. And then we came to the door.
Machi:
...Panel high up. I take off. Run away, run away!
Apollo:
So it was you who escaped through that air vent!
Klavier:
Ah ha ha. As the prosecution has held all along, no less. The defendant has admitted to being at the scene. Might we take this as a confession?
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
No! He's clearly denied that he did it!
Machi:
I no shooting! Manager on floor. Already on floor...
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
The victim had already been shot, you say? I find that hard to believe. The defendant understood the song lyrics. He was at the scene of the crime... This can only mean one thing. He is the shooter!
Machi:
!
Judge:
Does the defendant have anything to say to this?
Machi:
......
Trucy:
He's clammed up, Apollo!
Judge:
Then let's ask Mr. Justice. Will you require any further testimony from the witness?
Apollo:
(Is that it? Is there nothing else I can get him to testify about? Wait... no, of course there is!)
Trucy:
What is this cocoon, anyway?
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]....
Lamiroir:
"The cocoon, the silk, is a potent cure."
Trucy:
A cure...?
Trucy:
Well, Machi? Are you... a smuggler?
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]....
Lamiroir:
[Borginese speaking]!
Machi:
....................
Lamiroir:
He... won't tell me.
Apollo:
(That cocoon has to have something to do with this!) Machi. Please, tell us the truth, for your own sake.
Machi:
...No. No more speak. Not... to any of you.
Klavier:
So much for your precious trust, Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
(Hey, you were the one who didn't believe him!)
Klavier:
Regardless, this brings us to an impasse.
Judge:
It does seem that the defense and defendant are at odds. ...I doubt we are likely to learn anything more of value should this continue. I see no other course but to declare a five minute recess! The defense will work things out with the defendant so that we might proceed!

District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Machi:
...Apollo Yoostis...
Apollo:
(That's "Justice". Better learn how to say it if you ever want to get some.)
Machi:
Believe. I no shooting.
Apollo:
(Machi claims Mr. LeTouse was already down on the ground when he entered the room.)
Trucy:
Maybe... it was a trap, and he walked right into it?
Machi:
Suddenly. I hear revolver. Close. Very close. Then, I hear voice.
Apollo:
You heard gunshots?
Machi:
Yes. Is true. I hear revolver. But only sound.
Apollo:
Wait, you're saying you went into the dressing room... ...and found Mr. LeTouse already dead, and THEN you heard shots? (If that's true...!)
Trucy:
So... you were at the scene of the crime when you heard those shots?
Apollo:
And you escaped through the air vent.
Machi:
I know.
Trucy:
Huh? What do you know?
Machi:
I know if I opening vent... ...I can leave stage and back... backstage.
Apollo:
(So the vents went to both the stage and the backstage area? Is that what he means...?)
Trucy:
Hey, he's right! Look, Apollo!
Apollo:
Huh... Yeah. But how did you know it was connected like that?
Trucy:
Wait, I bet his father was the architect that designed the hall or something!
Machi:
I hear this. From magician.
Apollo:
Magician...?
Trucy:
D-Don't look at me!
Apollo:
(A magician, huh?)
Trucy:
Well, at least we're clear on one thing: Machi didn't shoot Mr. LeTouse!
Apollo:
Yeah, but what does that leave us with? We're supposed to say he went into the room to find the body and then he heard the shots? (That one's going to go over well in court. Not.)
Trucy:
Apollo! You're his defense! You're supposed to believe whatever he says. Even lies! That's what Daddy always told me!
Apollo:
Um, I'll just pretend you misheard him. Every time. So... what do we do?
Trucy:
You're sure you won't testify, Machi?
Machi:
I... no talking. No.
Trucy:
Hmm, well it was worth a shot.
Apollo:
(That cocoon...)
Machi:
[Borginese speaking]....
Lamiroir:
"I can't go home"...
Trucy:
Can't go home!?
Machi:
....[Borginese speaking]....[Borginese speaking] ....[Borginese speaking]....
Lamiroir:
"I can't go home to Borginia. I do not want to go home." The penalty for taking a cocoon from Borginia... is death.
Apollo:
(That's right! It's punishable by death!)
Apollo:
(Of course... He's scared.) ...Oh well, I guess we'll just have to try a different approach.
Trucy:
That's the spirit, Apollo! So, what's your plan?
Apollo:
If Machi won't testify about it, we'll have to get someone else to testify.
Trucy:
Someone... else?
Apollo:
...I think we're out of time. Let's get back in there.
Trucy:
Right!
July 10, 11:28 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
...Court is now back in session. Mr. Justice. Have you sorted things out with the defendant?
Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor. We had a good talk.
Judge:
Hmm, very well. So will he testify?
Apollo:
Your Honor, the defendant... will not testify.
Judge:
Wh-What!?
Klavier:
...... Shame. And here I thought this was your big chance to turn the case around.
Apollo:
Actually, it is. ...The defense would like to approach this case from a different angle, Your Honor!
Judge:
A different... angle?
Apollo:
(If Machi won't testify... ...then I know who will!) I would like to cross-examine the witness in this case... Lamiroir!
Judge:
L-Lamiroir...?
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
What are you up to now? I thought we determined yesterday that Lamiroir's testimony was insubstantial! There's nothing you can--
Apollo:
...Lamiroir was taken to the hospital yesterday with injuries.
Judge:
What happened?
Apollo:
She was assaulted, Your Honor.
Judge:
Assaulted!?
Apollo:
Someone wanted Lamiroir dead. Thankfully, she was able to save herself...
Klavier:
What!? I've heard no such report!
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin...
Klavier:
!
Apollo:
Why would anyone be out to kill Lamiroir? Can you think of a reason?
Klavier:
W-Well...
Apollo:
Think of how she is known in our country... A singer, from overseas, who doesn't speak English, yes? Yet someone tried to keep her mouth shut! Who could that have been?
Judge:
You don't think...
Apollo:
I do! It was the same person who shot Mr. LeTouse! The killer was afraid of her, afraid of what she might say! The defense believes that something was hidden in her testimony yesterday. Something that the killer doesn't want getting out!
Klavier:
So, am I to understand that this is what you are saying? Namely, that there is a nugget of "truth" in Lamiroir's testimony... ...A nugget we have yet to uncover?
Apollo:
...Exactly.
Judge:
Hmm... If Lamiroir was attacked, this has serious implications! Very well... There were some vague points in her testimony during yesterday's trial. Perhaps we did not inquire as deeply as we might have into some. The court will hear Lamiroir's testimony once more!
Klavier:
...Lamiroir, I must apologize. We must ask you to stand again and speak.
Lamiroir:
You need not apologize. I know that Machi is innocent. And I will do all that I can until the court realizes this.
Apollo:
Let's review your testimony from yesterday. You told us you heard two gunshots and the shooter's voice through the window. ...And that the voice belonged to Daryan Crescend, yes?
Lamiroir:
...That is correct.
Klavier:
At which point I proved she could not be correct. She couldn't have heard any of those things. The small window at the scene was closed, and was found to be quite soundproof.
Apollo:
......
Judge:
...You have nothing to say to that, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
I don't know exactly what, yet, but I do know there's something there!
Klavier:
There is, it seems, much you do not know.
Judge:
And yet it is my duty to hear him out. Perhaps the witness would be so kind as to testify once more to the court?
Lamiroir:
...Of course, Your Honor.
Witness Testimony
-- What I Heard --
Lamiroir:
I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.
That's when I heard them: Mr. LeTouse and the detective.
I heard the faint sound of a gunshot and stopped. Then I heard another gunshot.
There was the smell of gunpowder... I knew I must tell someone, but...
I was in a hurry, so I kept moving past the small window.
Judge:
Hmm... Pretty much the same as yesterday's testimony.
Lamiroir:
I am sorry. I am not used to speaking much in this language. Perhaps my descriptions are lacking in some way. Yet, everything I have said here is the truth.
Klavier:
Then it is my distinct displeasure to say this. What you have said to have happened... is impossible.
Apollo:
Do I have to repeat myself? Lamiroir was attacked because of this testimony!
Klavier:
...!
Trucy:
......
Apollo:
Wh-What? Trucy?
Trucy:
Apollo... You know, for a moment there... ...You were pretty cool.
Apollo:
(...Maybe I do better when I don't try to think ahead.)
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Justice. Perhaps you can "coolly" cross-examine the witness?
Cross Examination
-- What I Heard --
Lamiroir:
I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
......
Lamiroir:
Is something wrong?
Apollo:
(I raised an objection... ...but she's saying the same thing she said before...)
Judge:
Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
S-Sorry, it's nothing. Please continue with your testimony.
Judge:
Hmm. Now I know what they mean about the reckless youth these days.
Klavier:
The one in red over there is a shining example, Herr Judge.
Apollo:
(You're the last person who should be pointing fingers, Mr. Rock Star...)
Lamiroir:
That's when I heard them: Mr. LeTouse and the detective.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Daryan Crescend...?
Lamiroir:
I did not know his name at the time. But yes, it was him, the one who took the stand yesterday.
Klavier:
How many times do I need to remind you that's impossible? There is no way you could have heard him.
Apollo:
Because the window at the scene was closed? Is that why?
Klavier:
Of course.
Trucy:
Apollo! If we keep asking the same questions as yesterday we won't get anywhere!
Apollo:
(She's right. Maybe there's a different angle I can try?)
What were they talking about?
Leads to:
"Lamiroir, do you by any chance remember what they were saying to each other?"
Did you hear anything else?
Apollo:
Did you happen to hear anything else at that time?
Lamiroir:
Anything else...?
Apollo:
Anything else besides the victim and the shooter's conversation. Anything at all.
Klavier:
That's quite the vague question.
Lamiroir:
...... Other than the conversation? I heard a clock ticking, the two men breathing, footsteps. ...That is all.
Klavier:
Nothing new there, as expected.
Apollo:
(Ack! I was hoping for a little more than that!)
Judge:
Perhaps we should just carry on with the cross-examination.
Lamiroir:
As you wish.
No need
Apollo:
(On second thought, maybe I'll just play it safe here. See, I can be calm and collected, too, sometimes!)
Trucy:
Don't get too calm, or you might grind to a halt.
Apollo:
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Trucy:
I liked you better before with the "do I have to repeat myself" bit.
Apollo:
(Argh, so which should I be? ...Maybe I am overthinking this whole thing.)
Leads back to cross-examination
Apollo:
Lamiroir, do you by any chance remember what they were saying to each other? If so, please tell us!
Klavier:
......
Lamiroir:
I have given it much reflection, but...
Apollo:
(I was afraid of this. She doesn't remember...)
Lamiroir:
...I only heard one phrase clearly.
Apollo:
A whole phrase!?
Klavier:
You remember something that was said!?
Apollo:
Why didn't you say anything yesterday!?
Lamiroir:
Though my memory is clear, I was afraid to speak. You see, I do not understand what was said.
Apollo:
(This could be it! The clue I've been waiting for!) W-Well what did he say!?
Lamiroir:
It was the other man speaking, not Mr. LeTouse.
Apollo:
The shooter, then. (Daryan Crescend...)
Judge:
Well, what did he say!?
Lamiroir:
...... "It's over. Press the switch! Now!"
Judge:
"Switch"...? And the shooter said this to the victim, Mr. LeTouse?
Lamiroir:
I thought it quite strange myself, afterward.
Judge:
Hmm. It is a mystery. What could it possibly mean? Mr. Justice? Care to shed some light on this?
Apollo:
Urk. Um, I mean, sure...! I-I'd be delighted... It's, um, very, very vital! Maybe we could add that to the testimony!
Trucy:
"Maybe", Apollo?
Adds statement:
"From the small window, I heard a voice say, "Press the switch! Now!""
Press (after adding statement)
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
So, you remember a part of their conversation.
Lamiroir:
Yes, the conversation between Mr. LeTouse and the detective. I remember it quite clearly.
Lamiroir:
From the small window, I heard a voice say, "Press the switch! Now!"
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
And it was Detective Daryan Crescend's voice?
Lamiroir:
Yes, I am sure of it.
Judge:
"It's over. Press the switch." Why would he say that to Mr. LeTouse?
Trucy:
Apollo! The murder weapon, the revolver was Mr. LeTouse's, right?
Apollo:
Yeah... what of it?
Trucy:
Well, maybe when he said, "Press the switch"... ...he really meant to say, "Pull the trigger!"
Trucy:
Because his English isn't so good!
Apollo:
...... Daryan Crescend is a native speaker!
Trucy:
Oh. Oh, right! Sorry, I kind of forgot who was what.
Apollo:
("Press the switch"... That's not something a killer usually says to his or her victim, is it.)
Judge:
Was there no one else in the room?
Lamiroir:
...I do not know. All I heard was Mr. LeTouse and the detective.
Present Remote Trigger
Apollo:
Objection!
Leads to:
"..."Press the switch.""
Lamiroir:
I heard the faint sound of a gunshot and stopped. Then I heard another gunshot.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
There were two gunshots...
Lamiroir:
Yes, I heard two. One after the other.
Apollo:
(That fits with the bullet holes at the scene. Nothing really new here to pick up...)
Lamiroir:
There was the smell of gunpowder... I knew I must tell someone, but...
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Why didn't you tell someone immediately?
Lamiroir:
W-Well I...
Judge:
If it were me, I would have gone to the police right away. It's our duty as citizens!
Klavier:
This may be beside the point, but Lamiroir isn't a citizen. Though one would hope such common sense prevails in Borginia as well...?
Lamiroir:
......
Trucy:
Lamiroir seems awfully quiet all of a sudden.
Apollo:
(That's strange... Could she be hiding something?)
Lamiroir:
It is as you say, yet, at the time...
Lamiroir:
I was in a hurry, so I kept moving past the small window.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You were in a hurry... to go where?
Lamiroir:
...I was on my way to the backstage exit, as I have said.
Apollo:
Why were you in such a hurry then?
Lamiroir:
W-Well... I don't think that has anything to do with this case.
Apollo:
It very well might! Please answer the question!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Are you alright, Lamiroir?
Lamiroir:
Yes... Yes. I am just tired.
Klavier:
Recall what I told you yesterday, Herr Forehead. Lamiroir suffers from serious amnesia. Please refrain from traumatizing her further.
Apollo:
(Grr... What, so he can just dismiss questions he thinks are "too traumatizing"!?)
Klavier:
Why don't you prove her reason had a connection to the case before asking about it, ja?
Judge:
The prosecution's objection is sustained. The current question is moot. Mr. Justice, please continue with your cross-examination.
Apollo:
(Lamiroir was attacked because of this testimony. I know she was... So something's got to be hidden here!)
Trucy:
Maybe there's some detail we're missing?
Apollo:
I guess we'll just have to get her to fill in the blanks.
Trucy:
Right!
Apollo:
..."Press the switch." There's only one key that can unlock the mystery of those words!
Klavier:
Oh? Yet there was nothing at the scene that could be called a "switch". Save the lights'.
Apollo:
True, there wasn't a switch at the scene. But, it just so happens... I have a "switch" right here.
Judge:
That certainly does look like a switch, doesn't it.
Apollo:
The problem is... ...this was found not at the scene of the crime, but on the stage.
Judge:
The stage...?
Apollo:
Where the concert was held, yes. This was found hidden there!
Klavier:
On the stage...
Judge:
Are you claiming that the voice Lamiroir heard... ...was of someone commanding another to press this switch?
Apollo:
...It's a possibility.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Oh, Herr Forehead? I'd call that an "impossibility".
Apollo:
...Why?
Klavier:
It's hardly necessary for me to remind the court of the layout of the concert forum. The stage is quite far from Lamiroir's dressing room. Not to mention that the Gavinners were in the middle of a concert on said stage. We aren't known for being a quiet band. You could shout all you wanted and not be heard.
Lamiroir:
The detective's voice was loud... but certainly not a shout.
Klavier:
So, too, have Herr Forehead's cries of "possibility" fallen far short of being heard...
Apollo:
...Sorry, but he wouldn't have needed to shout.
Klavier:
...Excuse me?
Apollo:
You heard what I said. Or... do you need me to shout it out for you? It would have been quite simple to be heard on the stage from that dressing room. Oh, wait, you like evidence don't you? How about this! Using this, it would be easy to get a message to someone on stage from the dressing room.
Present Headset
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Prosecutor Gavin. Perhaps you're familiar with this?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
Hmm. So the shooter used this to erm, get his message to the stage? Perhaps you could demonstrate how this was done for us?
Apollo:
...... (Um... Maybe I was wrong?) ...Sorry, Your Honor.
Judge:
What? I can't hear you!
Apollo:
(Ha ha, very funny...)
Klavier:
Apparently, it is easier said than done.
Apollo:
Your Honor! If I might show another piece of evidence!!!
Judge:
No need to shout, Mr. Justice. Go ahead, show your evidence.
Apollo:
Neither did the shooter need to shout, Your Honor. Not with this...!
Leads back to:
"Using this, it would be easy to get a message to someone on stage from the dressing room."
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin. Perhaps you're familiar with this?
Klavier:
! Wh-Why that's...
Judge:
What? What is it!? Is that some kind of new-fangled phone they invented while I wasn't looking!?
Apollo:
This is a type of transmitter. A communications device.
Judge:
Communications? Device?
Apollo:
From what I've heard, that night... ...everyone on stage was wearing one of these. Isn't that right, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
Ah, yes, actually. They're for talking between band members. We all had one on.
Apollo:
So you admit that if you were wearing one of these... ...talking from the backstage to the stage would be simple!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
True, but wait! Those send out an electronic signal. To avoid interference with the audio systems, their range is quite limited.
Trucy:
Lamiroir said it was about thirty feet, right?
Apollo:
Look at this cross-section diagram of the concert forum.
Klavier:
Ah...
Apollo:
Exactly. The walk from the stage to the backstage seems far. But the direct distance is less than thirty feet!
Klavier:
That... can't be...
Judge:
So, when Lamiroir heard the shooter's voice... ...he could have been talking to someone on stage!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Hah! You're claiming this is the "switch" in question? Why did it have to be on the stage at the time? It could be placed in a pocket and carried anywhere! Someone could have hid it on the stage after the fact!
Trucy:
Hey... he's got a point! How do we know where it was when she heard the voice? ...When the shooter said "press the switch"?
Apollo:
Well, I guess we don't...
Judge:
Hmm... An unfortunate situation. I'm afraid that until we know where this switch was, there's little point in debating it.
Apollo:
Ugh... (I was sure this was the way to go with this...!)
Klavier:
What is this switch, anyway? We don't even know that basic fact.
Apollo:
...... (Wait a second... I do know what this "switch" is! And if you follow that train of logic to its incredible conclusion... ...it ends up in proof that completely changes this case!)
Trucy:
What's up, Apollo? Apollo...?
Apollo:
We know about this "switch", right? We know what it is.
Trucy:
Y...Yeah?
Apollo:
Well... think of when it was used that day... Think of what happened!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? If you have no further information to share concerning this switch...
Apollo:
...Your Honor!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
I've been remiss in not telling the court this before. I know what this "switch" is.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, it seems the defense is set upon linking this switch to the case. Let's see your evidence of the link! What evidence do you have to explain what this "switch" is?
Present Igniter
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Prosecutor Gavin, you remember this?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
......
Apollo:
(...Huh?)
Klavier:
I fail to see how this evidence links the "switch" to this case in any way.
Judge:
Mr. Justice... Might I recommend a "switch" of evidence?
Apollo:
(Ugh... I knew it.)
Judge:
Once again, please!
Leads back to:
"What evidence do you have to explain what this "switch" is?"
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin, you remember this?
Klavier:
Ach! That's that...
Judge:
That what!? Is it another one of those new-fangled phones!?
Apollo:
This... is an igniter. (What phone looks like this!?)
Judge:
I-I-Igniter? You mean it's like a lighter?
Apollo:
Yes, actually.
Klavier:
You aren't saying this switch is a remote...?
Apollo:
I am. This is a remote trigger for an igniter.
Klavier:
What...?
Apollo:
Look, I'll show you.
Judge:
.................. Yow yow yow yow yow! Mr. Justice! You will cease and desist from burning down this courtroom!
Apollo:
Er, sorry. That was a bit more fire than I'd expected.
Judge:
If my whiskers had caught on fire...
Apollo:
...Prosecutor Gavin. Let me repeat myself. This switch is a remote igniter trigger.
Klavier:
......
Apollo:
Doesn't that suggest something to you?
Klavier:
You're... talking about what happened to me, aren't you?
Trucy:
Ah...!
Apollo:
Exactly. That night at the concert there was one unusual burst of flame. ...When your guitar caught fire in the middle of the performance!
Judge:
Wasn't that part of the stage show, though?
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin was entirely unaware such a thing had been planned. And the guitar that burned was a valuable keepsake.
Trucy:
That's right... He got it in Borginia from Lamiroir! He said the sound was amazing. Before it burned, of course. Now it just kind of smokes.
Klavier:
The better the guitar, the brighter it burns. Herr Forehead!
Apollo:
Yes?
Klavier:
Don't tell me you're trying to tie these two things together? Those being the shooter's voice, heard by Lamiroir... ...and the guitar suddenly catching on fire?
Apollo:
I am. It's really simple when you think about it. Mr. LeTouse and the shooter were at the crime scene. The shooter was wearing a headset. He ordered someone on stage to "press the switch". The switch was pressed, and the guitar caught fire.
Judge:
Well, that does seem to make sense... Though something about it is bugging me. Can't quite put my finger on it...
Apollo:
Really? It seems pretty simple to me.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Herr Forehead, don't destroy what little respect I have for you!
Apollo:
......
Klavier:
I was expecting something a little more... sensible. I guess I was wrong.
Judge:
What's this all about, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
His simple story simply makes no sense. Think! That night, my guitar caught fire, yes. The cause... may have been this, indeed. However! The guitar caught fire during the second set!
Trucy:
Ack! That's right! Of course! The guitar caught fire during Lamiroir's song!
Klavier:
Indeed. Yet the shooting happened during the third set. The two are utterly unrelated!
Judge:
Hmm, yes, that must have been what was bugging me. The whole premise for this is faulty!
Klavier:
See? His story makes no sense.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Are you sure about that?
Judge:
...! What exactly do you mean, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
Maybe it's not the premise for my explanation of the switch that's at fault... ...Maybe it's our premise for the entire case so far!
Judge:
What premise is this, specifically?
Apollo:
I'm glad you asked. I'm saying that maybe the killing didn't take place in the third act!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
What's this? But Detective Ema Skye heard shots and found the body. All of this happened in the third act!
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Gunshots rang out... And, according to his testimony, Machi was in that dressing room at the time.
Judge:
Where are you going with this, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
Stay with me, Your Honor! He also told us this in his testimony: Namely, that the victim had already been shot! We all heard gunshots... but no one saw the shooting!
Klavier:
This... This is insane!
Apollo:
Just before the "shooting" took place, the "shooter" was heard on his headset... ...telling someone to "press the switch"! The next moment, Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flame. We know that a remote triggered igniter was inside the guitar. From all these facts, we can draw only one conclusion! The crime did not take place during the third act... ...but during the ballad performance... The second act!
Klavier:
Whaaat!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! B-But that goes against the evidence!
Apollo:
...What does, Your Honor?
Judge:
This crime was carried out according to the lyrics of that song, yes?
Trucy:
Hey, he's right! Look! The "bullet" is supposed to come after the "fire"!
Apollo:
You're thinking about it the wrong way.
Trucy:
Huh?
Apollo:
Look... Why would the shooter craft the events of the day to follow the lyrics anyway? It's an awful lot of trouble to go through. ...With little merit for the person doing it.
Judge:
Well, I'm sure whoever it was had some reason...
Apollo:
Yes, they did. A reason that made it advantageous to follow the lyrics.
Klavier:
...You're saying the order was reversed on purpose!
Judge:
Hmm? Reversed, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
If the criminal followed the lyrics strictly, then yes... ...the shooting would have had to come after the guitar burst into flame. Yet, Herr Forehead has raised another possibility. He's claiming that the bullet came not after, but just before the "fire".
Apollo:
...Couldn't have put it better myself. We were only meant to think that the shooting came after the guitar burst into flame! That was the criminal's objective! The crime followed the lyrics to a point, but that was the ruse! Why else would the killer risk discovery by moving the body? That was the final touch to make us think he'd followed the lyrics the whole way!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! That would explain this most unusual situation...
Apollo:
It does! The killer changed the order of events to create himself an alibi! In other words... The killer was someone who had an alibi for the third set, but not the second!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. But sadly, it has. Let me tell you why your little fairy tale makes no sense at all.
Apollo:
......
Klavier:
Oh, it sounds good, I'll give you that. You've given us a reason why the killer bothered following the lyrics of my song. But I question your logic! ...For it's flawed from the very beginning.
Apollo:
Flawed?
Klavier:
Yes. A contradiction, Herr Forehead, one I've pointed out several times, no less. At the time of the crime, the small window at the scene was closed... How could Lamiroir have heard a voice through it?
Apollo:
Oh...
Klavier:
I know that you would like to divert our attention from this critical fact. But you're basing your entire line of reasoning on a false premise!
Apollo:
...... (Right... Lamiroir's testimony is my entire case... ...That voice she heard... The shooter's voice...)
Trucy:
W-What if she couldn't hear it, Apollo?
Apollo:
Look, what do we have. A man saying "press the switch!" And near the crime scene, we have a switch. Which acts as a remote trigger for an igniter. And last, but not least, Prosecutor Gavin's flaming guitar. (It can't all be coincidence! But how do I make it work?)
Klavier:
I see a more direct line of questioning is required. When the crime scene was investigated, immediately after the crime... ...that window was closed! Care to tell us how Lamiroir heard the voice?
Judge:
Hmm... A key point, to be sure. ...Mr. Justice! Can you explain this to the court?
Apollo:
(OK Justice, you've got one thing to prove, and one thing only. Lamiroir heard a "voice"... ...and she heard it during the second set! Think! How was Lamiroir able to hear the voice?)
The window was open.
Apollo:
Obviously, the window was open... It had to be for her to hear the voice!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
News bulletin, Herr Forehead: That horse is dead. Stop beating it, for all our sakes. That window was closed! This is a hard fact, reported by the investigation team.
Apollo:
B-But...
Klavier:
Oh? You have evidence to the contrary, perhaps?
Apollo:
Well, no, but...
Klavier:
Then do be quiet. I tire of this charade.
Apollo:
(Grr... Time to rethink this!)
Leads back to:
"Lamiroir heard a "voice"..."
She has divine hearing.
Apollo:
The window was closed, as you say, yet Lamiroir could still hear the voice... ...because she has the power of divine hearing! That's the only explanation!
Lamiroir:
......
Klavier:
......
Judge:
...The witness is a Siren, Mr. Justice. Not a Saint.
Apollo:
Um, I said "hearing", Your Honor, not "healing". (Well that fell on deaf ears.)
Lamiroir:
I'm not sure I know what this "divine hearing" ability is...
Klavier:
Then perhaps we should hear it straight from the All-Powerful Voice himself. Care to explain how clairaudience has anything to do with this case?
Apollo:
Uh... Erm... Can we just move on now?
Judge:
Only if you can enlighten this court!
Apollo:
(Time to rethink this...!)
Leads back to:
"Lamiroir heard a "voice"..."
She was somewhere else.
Leads to:
"When we investigated the scene, the window was closed."
Apollo:
When we investigated the scene, the window was closed. The shooter had no reason to close it, had it been open, either. Meaning, it was impossible to hear the voice through that window.
Klavier:
Ah, it's good to hear you making sense again. For a moment, I was afraid you might be a Borginian, too.
Apollo:
...As I was saying, Lamiroir could not hear the voice through that window. So there can be only one explanation. She heard the voice from another location entirely!
Judge:
Wh-What's this...?
Klavier:
Ha ha ha, you do amuse me so. And here I thought you and good sense were back on speaking terms. Now, I'm afraid you and good sense speak two entirely different languages.
Apollo:
......
Klavier:
Shall I interpret for you, Herr Forehead? Lamiroir clearly stated she heard the voice through that small window! And there is only one "small window" at the scene!
Apollo:
...Are you sure?
Klavier:
!
Apollo:
Think about it... Isn't there another "small window" at the scene?
Trucy:
Th-There is!?
Judge:
Ah, I know that look. He wants us to ask him. Very well. You claim Lamiroir heard the voice from another location? Mr. Justice, show us where this location was!
Apollo:
Lamiroir heard the voice from... here!
Present air vent
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...This is where Lamiroir heard that voice from."
Present small window
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
There! That's a small window!
Klavier:
And this changes what?
Apollo:
(Not much, I know...) ...Erm, I couldn't find anything better, so...
Judge:
The court applauds your honesty. And weeps for your case, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
(You're not the only one crying here...)
Trucy:
Apollo! Think it through again!
Apollo:
I know... I'm trying... (Lamiroir claims she heard the voice through a "small window". ...And if the small window we know about was closed... ...there's only one other thing she could have meant!)
Leads back to:
"Lamiroir heard the voice from... here!"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
...... Does this look like a small window to you, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
...The state of modern society can be read from numerous objects and artifacts. In a sense, anything can be a "window" on our society.
Judge:
I didn't ask you to point out a window on society. I want a window on the crime scene!
Apollo:
(No points for trying...? Lamiroir claims she heard the voice through a "small window". ...And if the small window we know about was closed... ...there's only one other thing she could have meant!)
Leads back to:
"Lamiroir heard the voice from... here!"
Apollo:
...This is where Lamiroir heard that voice from.
Judge:
B-But that's no "small window"! That's the air vent!
Apollo:
What did she tell us? She said she's a Borginian, unfamiliar with our language! It's not a stretch to imagine she called this "air vent" a "small window"!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Now you've done it. You've gone beyond ridiculous and into... ludicrous. So Lamiroir was up in the ventilation system listening to this man's voice?
Apollo:
That's the only logical explanation, yes.
Klavier:
"Logical"? I do not think this word means what you think it means, Herr Forehead!
Apollo:
OK, what about it isn't logical?
Klavier:
Hah! It hardly merits saying! Why would Lamiroir be in the ventilation system? Hiding like a rat! No offense intended to her, of course.
Apollo:
The explanation for that is simple, Prosecutor Gavin. Isn't it... Lamiroir?
Lamiroir:
...!
Apollo:
You have been listening to our discussion here, yes?
Lamiroir:
...Yes. I admit, it's had me quite confused since yesterday. Yes, the small window was closed... ...but why should that mean I could not hear through it? I feared our prosecutor might himself need an interpreter...
Klavier:
Urk...
Apollo:
The problem here is words. Lamiroir, this "small window" through which you heard the voice... Was it up high, on the ceiling of the room? Not low on a wall?
Lamiroir:
...Yes, it was up on the ceiling.
Klavier:
Whaaaat!?
Judge:
Order! Order! I will have order!!!
Judge:
...Witness! You will clarify this statement to the court! Are you, in fact, saying that you were up above the ceiling of the room? And that's where you heard the moment of the crime?
Lamiroir:
Yes, in fact, I was. I am sorry. I never imagined it would become such an important point...
Apollo:
Yes, well... why the heck were you up there!?
Lamiroir:
......
Judge:
I believe it's time for another testimony.
Lamiroir:
I... I'm not sure I... I can't.
Judge:
May I remind you this is a murder trial? We will hear your testimony! Tell us why you "witnessed" the crime from above the ceiling of that room! ...Please.
Lamiroir:
......
Apollo:
(Well... Looks like I'm on the right track...)
Witness Testimony
-- Above the Ceiling --
Lamiroir:
Yes, I was above the ceiling when I heard the voice.
I had heard there was a, er, "small window" there before.
It was in the middle of my performance... I had no time to report what I had heard.
As to why I was there... I cannot say.
I am bound to secrecy on this matter.
Judge:
B-Bound to secrecy!?
Lamiroir:
In my line of work, one has many obligations to uphold.
Judge:
But you say you were in the middle of your performance! So this did happen during the second set!
Lamiroir:
...I did not witness the crime, you must understand. I only know what I heard.
Judge:
Yes, but you must tell us what you were doing, in detail!
Klavier:
That's what the cross-examination is for, ja, Herr Forehead?
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
Our mission in this court is to discern the truth. No obligation, no binding pact, may hinder that mission.
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Mr. Justice, you may begin the cross-examination.
Trucy:
Wh-What are you going to do, Apollo!?
Apollo:
...I'm going to find out the truth. (...She was up above that ceiling for a reason. I just have to get it out of her.)
Cross Examination
-- Above the Ceiling --
Lamiroir:
Yes, I was above the ceiling when I heard the voice.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Above the ceiling... Could you be more specific?
Lamiroir:
I... cannot.
Apollo:
Because you're bound to secrecy?
Lamiroir:
Yes... To tell the truth, I was not supposed to even say I was above the ceiling. I dare not say more...
Apollo:
(Hmm. Doesn't sound like I'll be able to coax it out of her just by asking...)
Lamiroir:
I had heard there was a, er, "small window" there before.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
By "small window", you mean the air vent?
Lamiroir:
I only remembered I needed to be careful of where I put my hands and feet. I cannot see the light coming through the window, of course.
Judge:
The air vent grate could trip you up, certainly.
Lamiroir:
So, I was walking very carefully when I heard the gunshots. Startled, I crouched and listened. That is when I heard his voice come from the room.
Apollo:
(Daryan's voice...)
Lamiroir:
I knew something terrible had happened, yet...
Lamiroir:
It was in the middle of my performance... I had no time to report what I had heard.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
So, without a word, you just let the third set start?
Lamiroir:
After the curtain closed for the second set, there was still much to do...
Apollo:
You could have prevented this whole misunderstanding if you had only told us sooner!
Lamiroir:
...Yes, perhaps I could have.
Klavier:
I see little point in badgering the witness. What's done is done! The mind works differently when one is in the middle of a performance. Why, I've lost my voice in the middle of a show and kept on singing, completely unaware.
Apollo:
(Singing without a voice? ...If only all contradictions were so obvious. ...If only I could get Lamiroir to talk. Pressuring her like this doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere.)
Lamiroir:
As to why I was there... I cannot say.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You heard the gunshots during the second set, during your performance. ...You're quite sure?
Lamiroir:
Yes... Why would I lie about the time?
Judge:
Why didn't you tell us this yesterday!?
Lamiroir:
No one asked me. I thought you all knew...
Judge:
Hmrgh...
Lamiroir:
I told you Machi was not the killer. I told you this many times!
Apollo:
Yes, you did... ...But you never told us why.
Lamiroir:
...I am sorry. I... was not able to speak of it.
Apollo:
(Unable... or unwilling?)
Trucy:
She's not talking, Apollo. What do we do?
Apollo:
We'll just have to prove it ourselves. ...As long as she is bound by this pact of silence, she won't talk. But if I can prove why she was up there, she'll have to admit it.
Trucy:
But how are you going to do that!? She was singing on the stage, Apollo! She couldn't have been up above the ceiling, too!
Apollo:
Yes she could.
Trucy:
!
Apollo:
I've got a theory as to why, too... And maybe I've got the evidence to prove it!
Present Video Tape
Apollo:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Lamiroir, truth be told, the reason for your presence above that ceiling is quite clear."
Lamiroir:
I am bound to secrecy on this matter.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Exactly who bound you to secrecy?
Lamiroir:
I'm... not sure I'm allowed to say who it was. ...No, I think perhaps that is alright. It is just a name, after all. It was Valant Gramarye... Perhaps you know him?
Klavier:
Valant Gramarye! What!?
Trucy:
You mean Uncle Valant!?
Judge:
What!? Valant Gramarye!? ...... Who's Valant Gramarye?
Lamiroir:
A grand magician... the one responsible for the illusion performed during our concert.
Klavier:
......
Apollo:
(Interesting reaction, Prosecutor Gavin...)
Apollo:
(Lamiroir was bound to secrecy... ...It's going to take some hard-hitting proof to make her talk! I think I know why she was up there... but how do I prove it?)
Apollo:
Lamiroir, truth be told, the reason for your presence above that ceiling is quite clear. Especially when you consider what happened during your performance.
Lamiroir:
What "happened"...?
Apollo:
Yes. It's all right here on this video.
It wraps itself around me,And now through the air I fly.
Woh... Woh...
Burning on in my heart. Fire.Burn my love away. All away.
Like a bullet of love. Fire.Take my life away. All away.
Guitar, Guitar...Up together to the sky.
Lamiroir:
......
Apollo:
As we can see, Lamiroir was clearly not on stage for her entire performance!
Judge:
Ah...
Apollo:
Though it saddens me to be so realistic... Lamiroir is incapable of actually vanishing, let alone teleportation. So, the only explanation is that she was hidden from view. And during that time, she moved to the back of the forum.
Trucy:
Apollo!
Apollo:
Wh-What, Trucy?
Trucy:
It's not nice to reveal a magician's secrets! And it's against the rules!
Apollo:
But I'm a lawyer! I'm not supposed to be nice!
Judge:
This... is all very fascinating. But how is it possible? There is only twenty seconds between when she disappears and reappears! She couldn't have moved that fast!
Klavier:
......
Judge:
Is... something wrong, Prosecutor Gavin?
Apollo:
...This was his concert, his show. He knows how the illusion was performed.
Judge:
Ah ha!
Apollo:
He's just realizing his own oversight. Let's look at the cross-section diagram again. Here, we can trace a route through the ceiling... It goes from the stage, through the backstage to the rear of the forum.
Judge:
Ah... Aaaaah!
Apollo:
Recall Lamiroir's testimony from yesterday...
Lamiroir:
I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit. There was something like a little window there... That's how I saw it.
Judge:
She went from the stage to the backstage exit... ...a perfect description of this route above the ceiling!
Apollo:
Lamiroir knew of this because of her part in the illusion. But she wasn't the only one who knew.
Klavier:
What...?
Apollo:
Just now in the lobby, Machi told me something:
Machi:
I know. I know if I opening vent...  ...I can leave stage and back... backstage.
Klavier:
He said that!?
Apollo:
Oh, were you not informed, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
............ I... I knew about the vanishing act, of course. Yet, I had no idea of the route that would be used. Why didn't that magician tell me!
Trucy:
Magicians only reveal details of their acts on a need-to-know basis. They're the bread and butter of a magician's life, you know.
Apollo:
(Which is why he bound Lamiroir to secrecy...) ...Well, Lamiroir?
Lamiroir:
...I am impressed, Mr. Attorney. Machi was right about you.
Judge:
So... what does this mean? Are you saying you used this route above the ceiling?
Lamiroir:
...I did.
Judge:
Well, that's that... but I'm still a little confused.
Apollo:
Why's that, Your Honor?
Judge:
As I said before... There was very little time between when she disappeared and when she reappeared. Twenty seconds, tops! How could she do it so fast? Especially if she stopped to hear the shooter's voice!
Apollo:
That... That's a good question.
Judge:
Can the witness explain this to the court?
Lamiroir:
I... cannot.
Judge:
...Very well. Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
Yes?
Judge:
It's all up to you. Do your thing.
Apollo:
Um, what thing, Your Honor?
Judge:
You need to explain how Lamiroir was able to teleport like she did. Or I'm throwing your case out with the bathwater.
Apollo:
Ugh... (Why do I get picked on? It's Lamiroir who isn't going along with the program here!)
Lamiroir:
As I have stated before... I am not at liberty to speak of the illusion that night in detail.
Judge:
Then, you'll just have to tell us what you can. We'll hear your testimony on this. Mr. Justice, it will be your job to wring the truth out of her.
Lamiroir:
Yes, if you would, please.
Apollo:
...Right. (I feel like a student before finals...)
Trucy:
Good luck, Apollo!
Witness Testimony
-- The Big Illusion --
Lamiroir:
I followed the route exactly as I was instructed.
There is an emergency exit in the backstage, where a stagehand waited.
From there, one can enter the forum on the opposite side from the stage.
The plan was for me to move there in two minutes.
I was on my way, when I heard the voice.
Judge:
Hmm... Two minutes, you say? The mystery deepens!
Apollo:
(I suppose it was too much to hope that the judge would come up with something...)
Judge:
As does my curiosity! Take it away, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
...Right, Your Honor. (All I have to do is find the contradiction between what Lamiroir is saying... ...and what we can see plainly in the video.)
Trucy:
I figured it out already! I am a magician, after all.
Apollo:
Well, tell me!
Trucy:
Not a chance! I can't reveal another magician's secrets! C'mon!
Apollo:
(Hey! You're supposed to be on my side here!)
Cross Examination
-- The Big Illusion --
Lamiroir:
I followed the route exactly as I was instructed.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
How did you, er, proceed along this "route"?
Lamiroir:
How? Why, I walked.
Apollo:
But you arrived behind the forum much too fast to have been walking! Tell the truth Lamiroir... you rode some kind of vehicle!
Judge:
What!? A vehicle!? What vehicle?
Klavier:
Ah, what a novel idea. I like it.
Trucy:
Hey, that's not a bad guess! Wrong, but not bad!
Apollo:
(Hah hah, yes, laugh at the dumb attorney. I don't mind.)
Lamiroir:
Ah ha ha. I'm sorry, but the girl is right. That vent was much too small for vehicles.
Lamiroir:
It was a tight fit. Even I had to crouch as I walked. I cannot imagine a vehicle that would fit in such a small space.
Apollo:
(Argh! If it wasn't a vehicle what was it?)
Judge:
You had me going for a while there, Mr. Justice. Too bad! Ready for the next part?
Apollo:
(Why do I feel like I'm on some kind of quiz show?)
Lamiroir:
There is an emergency exit in the backstage, where a stagehand waited.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Did everyone on the concert staff know about the trick?
Lamiroir:
Not all. Only a few that were needed to help.
Trucy:
See? Like I said, it's on a need-to-know basis.
Apollo:
(So, not many people knew about the trick...)
Judge:
What were these stagehands required to do?
Lamiroir:
One needed to open the emergency exit. The door to the stairs is locked, but once through there...
Lamiroir:
From there, one can enter the forum on the opposite side from the stage.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
So when you came back out, you were behind the audience.
Lamiroir:
Yes, that is how it worked.
Klavier:
Not a bad show, if I do say so myself.
Trucy:
That's Uncle Valant for you! The old Gramarye touch!
Judge:
But on the video, you were only gone for twenty seconds! How is that possible?
Apollo:
(That's the part I don't get either...)
Lamiroir:
Ah ha ha. Yes, it would be hard to go so far in only twenty seconds...
Lamiroir:
The plan was for me to move there in two minutes.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Two minutes...?
Lamiroir:
Yes. It can be done in one minute, if you are running.
Apollo:
Running? In that cramped, dark tunnel above the ceiling?
Lamiroir:
Ha ha, Mr. Attorney. Have you forgotten? Dark or lit, it makes no difference to me.
Apollo:
Ah, that's true, but...
Judge:
So, you're saying that on the night of the concert, you made the trip in two minutes?
Lamiroir:
Yes... though I nearly didn't make it in time. You see... I stopped halfway.
Apollo:
(Lamiroir disappears on the video for twenty seconds. But she says she made the trip in two minutes! How?)
Trucy:
If you want my professional opinion, I'll bet the answer's right there in that video.
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? Perhaps you have some evidence for us? Something that can explain the discrepancy between the video and her testimony?
Apollo:
Ack! (Evidence explaining the discrepancy...?)
Present evidence
Apollo:
There's one piece of evidence that explains the discrepancy between video and testimony!
Present Brooch
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
Lamiroir... do you happen to remember this brooch?
Judge:
Ah ha! The brooch! We saw that yesterday, did we not?
Apollo:
It was found at the scene, Your Honor.
Klavier:
And you're bringing this up now... why? I thought we had already determined when that was dropped.
Apollo:
So did I... but we hadn't.
Klavier:
...!
Apollo:
Take another look at the video... Here, you can see she's wearing the brooch!
Judge:
Hmm... So she is.
Apollo:
Let's look a bit later.
Judge:
Wh-Whaaat? The brooch! It's gone!
Klavier:
Whaaat...!?
Apollo:
Yes... the brooch disappeared in the short space of twenty seconds. And it takes a full minute to run from the stage to the backstage... Which means there can be only one explanation. The Lamiroir we see before the vanishing act and the Lamiroir we see after... ...are two different people!
Judge:
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Apollo:
The brooch was found on the floor at the crime scene. And not just on the floor... ...but on the floor directly beneath the air vent! Lamiroir, tell me... Did you drop the brooch on your way from the stage to the backstage? ...At the very moment you "witnessed" the crime?
Lamiroir:
...Yes, I think I did.
Judge:
Order! P-Prosecutor Gavin!
Klavier:
...From your expression, I gather you had no idea this was the case, Herr Judge. I, of course, knew about it.
Judge:
Wh-What?
Klavier:
Don't get me wrong, I wasn't hiding it. It just never occurred to me... ...that the switch and the shooting took place at the same time.
Apollo:
So... I was right? There was a switch?
Klavier:
There was. Just before the stage's tower rose, Lamiroir was "replaced".
Judge:
While we're on the subject, just who was this replacement Lamiroir...?
Klavier:
Why, the man behind the illusion. Valant Gramarye.
Apollo:
(It was Gramarye...!?) That's... quite the illusion. But I still don't get one thing...
Lamiroir:
Yes?
Apollo:
...The switch happened before the tower rose, correct? So you weren't on the stage!
Lamiroir:
That's right.
Apollo:
But this, er, fake Lamiroir is still singing! And she's pretty good!
Judge:
That's true!
Trucy:
C'mon, Apollo! That's an easy one. They were just playing a recording!
Klavier:
Ah ha ha... The Gavinners aren't some kind of air guitar band, Fräulein.
Trucy:
Oh? You mean, I'm wrong?
Klavier:
When we play a show live, we play live. No recordings. ...Perhaps you can explain, Lamiroir?
Lamiroir:
Very well...
Judge:
Yes, do tell! And add it to your testimony.
Changes statement from "I was on my way, when I heard the voice." to "I... had to keep singing, even while I moved."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
Ah ha! So this is it? The magical key to unlocking this illusion's dark secret!? Tell us how it works! Quickly! I can't bear the suspense!
Apollo:
(...I was kind of hoping someone else would jump in at this point.) W-Well, you see...
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Herr Judge, I do hate to spoil the mood... ...but I haven't the faintest idea what he's talking about. And neither does he.
Trucy:
I'm a little confused, too, there, Apollo.
Apollo:
...Right! By which I conclude that... I was wrong.
Trucy:
Better luck next time, Polly-wog!
Judge:
...Mr. Justice. I'm holding you responsible for spoiling my mood!
Apollo:
(Was that a tear I just saw in the judge's eye? ...Alright, nothing to do but rethink this through. The key's in the video somewhere. I'm sure of it!)
Leads back to cross-examination
There's no evidence
Apollo:
(What kind of evidence could prove that...?) Um, what's your professional opinion about this one, Trucy?
Trucy:
Sorry. I don't work in evidence.
Apollo:
And I don't work in tricks! I'm an attorney, not a magician for crying out loud!
Trucy:
Really? I'm sure Daddy would have loved working on this.
Apollo:
Thanks, that makes me feel oh so much better.
Judge:
Well, I don't know about all of you, but I find this mystery fascinating! And I'm not letting this trial go any further until we get to the bottom of it! The defense will continue with the cross-examination until we have some answers!
Apollo:
(Easier said than done...)
Leads back to cross-examination
Press (after changing fifth statement)
Apollo:
Hold it!

All made possible by the switching trick.
Lamiroir:
It was quite a surprise to me at first. To think, a man, posing as me!
Klavier:
An enchantment woven with music and magic... Perfection!
Lamiroir:
Yes, above all else, I was careful that the music did not stop.
Lamiroir:
I was on my way, when I heard the voice.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
And it was Daryan's voice you heard?
Lamiroir:
Yes, I am certain it was him.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
A matter best left for later, ja? Put that forehead of yours to work on this illusion first.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Hold on! I think the identity of the killer is a little more important, don't you?
Judge:
Importance shmortance! Objection overruled! Tell us about the illusion!
Trucy:
No use trying to avoid the problem at hand, Apollo.
Apollo:
(Trying to avoid the problem? This is a murder trial, the killer is the problem!)
Lamiroir:
I... had to keep singing, even while I moved.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Leads to:
"You were... singing...?"
Apollo:
(The contradiction between Lamiroir's testimony and the video... Unraveling an illusion can't be so different from solving a normal case... Right...?)
Trucy:
Sorry, Apollo. I'm not telling. Not even if you make those puppy dog faces.
Apollo:
(...Fine, fine.)
Apollo:
You were... singing...?
Lamiroir:
Yes. Mr. Gavin expressed a dislike for recordings... So I used this.
Apollo:
Wait... so you were singing the whole time? Even when you were crawling above the ceiling toward the backstage!?
Lamiroir:
Why should it matter where I sing, when everywhere I go is the same darkness?
Judge:
B-But if you were singing while you were walking...
Trucy:
That's right! Wouldn't the shooter and victim have heard? She was singing right over their heads, after all!
Apollo:
That... is right!
Klavier:
...Are you sure?
Apollo:
You'd have to be pretty hard of hearing to miss someone singing in the ceiling!
Klavier:
Once again we come back to the state of the scene of the crime.
Apollo:
What state...?
Trucy:
Ack... I know what he means! That old speaker, Apollo!
Apollo:
The speaker!?
Apollo:
That speaker was blaring at the time of the murder...
Ema:
Ah, that's for monitoring the stage from this room.
Trucy:
Monitoring?
Ema:
It pipes in a real-time feed from the stage microphones. Useful for knowing when your set is coming up.
Klavier:
...Satisfied? That dressing room was fitted with a large speaker playing a direct feed from the stage. ...At my request, actually.
Apollo:
So Lamiroir singing in the ceiling... ...sounded just like Lamiroir singing over the speaker.
Judge:
Ingenious! Her voice was hidden... by her voice!
Lamiroir:
Ah...
Apollo:
Lamiroir?
Lamiroir:
I... have just remembered something.
Judge:
Do tell!
Lamiroir:
When I heard the noise... the gunshots, yes? It startled me, so I...
Apollo:
So you...?
Lamiroir:
I stopped singing.
Judge:
What...?
Lamiroir:
I forgot the words I was supposed to sing!!
Apollo:
(The song... stopped!?)
Lamiroir:
Thankfully, it was the very beginning of the second verse. So not many would notice.
Klavier:
Forehead! That mixing board I lent you! Where is it?
Apollo:
The mixing... huh?
Trucy:
That machine, Apollo! The one that breaks music into tracks!
Apollo:
Oh, this! I'd completely forgotten about it... Let's take a listen!
Sugar, Sugar...O that night, in your embrace.
When you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.
Pleasure...But a fleeting melody
Apollo:
The song does stop there!
Judge:
It does? I must have missed it...
Apollo:
Look at the lyrics sheet, at the top of the second verse. See where it says "Pleasure, Pleasure..."? Now listen again!
When you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.
Pleasure...But a fleeting melody
Judge:
...This is evidence indeed! I believe we are guilty of making a terrible mistake.
Apollo:
The crime didn't happen during the third set. It happened during the second, during Lamiroir's ballad.
Judge:
If that is true... ...then no one on stage during the second set could have been the shooter!
Apollo:
Which means that Daryan Crescend could have done it! He wasn't on stage for the second set!
Klavier:
......
Apollo:
Well, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
...Fascinating.
Apollo:
!
Klavier:
I don't believe I've ever seen a trial turned around quite so thoroughly. ...Yet one problem remains.
Judge:
What's that, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
Herr Forehead's theory does have a certain kind of logic to it. Yet it is entirely based upon Lamiroir's testimony.
Judge:
Yes? Is there a problem with that?
Klavier:
Well, it's quite simple, though it pains me to say it. What if she is lying to protect the defendant?
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
But you have no proof...!
Klavier:
All I'm saying is that the truth is as yet unclear. ...Until we hear directly from the man himself.
Judge:
The man... you don't mean!?
Klavier:
...Yes. Though he is a friend, and band member, Daryan Crescend must take the stand. I see no other way.
Judge:
As... someone with a new perspective on the case?
Klavier:
...As a suspect, to be frank.
Apollo:
(...Finally! The rat's coming out of his hole! And I'm ready to catch him! Daryan Crescend, get ready for Justice!)
Judge:
This is as good a time as any to pause for a brief recess. The prosecution will summon the witness. Have him here and ready by the time we begin.
Klavier:
...I'm the last man who needs to be reminded of what his duties are.
Judge:
Very well, court is adjourned for a fifteen-minute recess!
To be continued.

Apollo! I can't believe it! It really happened during the second act? A-And right in the middle of Lamiroir's performance!?

Why she was in that air vent... ...and that "switch" and the flaming guitar. When you link it all together, that's what you end up with.

I just thought that'd make a cooler entrance than, say, "hiya"!
Apollo:
...Why do I even bother hoping?
Trucy:
Where have you been lately, Daddy? You haven't been coming to the office at all!
Phoenix:
Ah, sorry about that, Trucy. I'm on a... secret mission.
Trucy:
Secret? You mean like, you're undercover?
Apollo:
Like Mr. LeTouse, only shorter and not as well dressed.
Trucy:
Oh no! What if you're shot, too, Daddy!?
Phoenix:
Ah ha ha! Would I do a thing like that to you? Anyway, I'm off for a while again.
Apollo:
Huh? You're leaving?
Phoenix:
Oh, one thing before I go.
Apollo:
What?
Phoenix:
............... Good luck.
Apollo:
...Right.
Phoenix:
......
Apollo:
...... Um... Is that all you came to say?
Phoenix:
...I think you have things pretty much under control. You'll get Machi Tobaye off the hook, no doubt.
Apollo:
Yeah, but...
Phoenix:
But you're after that detective, aren't you?
Apollo:
Daryan Crescend...
Phoenix:
It won't be easy proving he did it. Especially not under the current court system...
Apollo:
The current court system...?
Phoenix:
What did Prosecutor Gavin say during the trial? Your case is based on one fragile assumption. ...Namely, that our diva divine is telling the truth.
Trucy:
But what about all the proof? The brooch... and the switch!
Phoenix:
A piece of jewelry, and a lyrical blunder... There are plenty of other ways to explain these things. The flaming guitar, too. ...All because you lack definitive proof of their connection to the case.
Trucy:
But...!
Phoenix:
If the sultry songstress is lying... ...your case melts like butter in a frying pan. Leaving behind the faintly singed scent of failure.
Apollo:
So what do I do!?
Phoenix:
Like I said. Good luck. And be aware that it will be impossible to prove his guilt by conventional methods.
Apollo:
Ugh...
Phoenix:
Oh, that reminds me. I have something to give you from our detective friend.
Apollo:
Detective Skye... Ema!?
Phoenix:
Let's see. This bag of snacks here was meant for me... Ah, here it is.
Trucy:
What are those, Daddy? They don't look like very good snacking material.
Phoenix:
They were found at the scene. Analysis of the fragments revealed traces of gunpowder.
Trucy:
Gunpowder...!?
Phoenix:
Probably a firecracker or something similar, like the ones kids are into these days. These fragments were found under the sofa at the scene of the crime, actually.
Apollo:
Under the sofa...
Trucy:
Hey, Apollo! That's where we found that little device thingy!
Apollo:
Right... this. (Well, finally, some evidence that makes sense...)
Burnt Fragments added to the Court Record.
Examine evidence
Burnt Fragments
Fragments
Apollo:
So... you think this was some kind of firecracker?
Trucy:
Yeah, or one of those noisemakers, like you shoot off on New Years!
Apollo:
Did you know that in China, they use firecrackers on New Years to scare off evil? So, it's kind of same thing.
Trucy:
Really!? I had no idea! Well did you know this? It takes more than 500 peanuts to make one 12-ounce jar of peanut butter!
Apollo:
(At least my useless fact had something to do with the evidence...)
Phoenix:
That's all for me, I suppose. See you after the verdict. Maybe.
Apollo:
Right...
Phoenix:
Every man has an igniter inside him.
Apollo:
...Excuse me?
Phoenix:
Find Daryan Crescend's igniter... and set it off.
Apollo:
(And he walked out the door, just like... just like a magician. Normally.)
Trucy:
Uhh... What does he want us to do? No "conventional methods"? What does that mean?
Apollo:
I guess we just have to take his advice, and hope it makes sense when the time comes.
Trucy:
I guess...
Apollo:
(We're almost at the finish line. Hang in there, Trucy.)
July 10, 1:55 PM
District CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
...Court is now back in session. Prosecutor Gavin, where is Detective Crescend?
Klavier:
In the witness lounge, ready to be called at any time.
Judge:
Very well.
Klavier:
Might I add... I don't believe any of this. He... Daryan was the first detective I ever worked with. We stopped working together when he moved to Criminal Affairs, Division 3... But his guitar playing... it fires my imagination!
Apollo:
That's nice, but it has nothing to do with the matter at hand. ...Correct?
Klavier:
Oh, I know. ...Herr Forehead.
Judge:
Very well, call the final witness to the stand! ...Detective Daryan Crescend!
Klavier:
...Name and occupation, please.
Daryan:
Daryan Crescend. Detective, Criminal Affairs, Division 3. That's the International Affairs Division, for those of you who didn't know. ...And I'm a guitarist for the Gavinners. Maybe you've heard of us?
Judge:
Do you fully understand the circumstances under which you stand before us today?
Daryan:
Yeah, I understand, Your Honor. What I don't understand... is how you let this happen, "partner".
Klavier:
......
Daryan:
You gave me your word I wouldn't be standing here.
Klavier:
The situation's changed, Daryan... And don't call me "partner".
Daryan:
Feh. So much for old friends.
Klavier:
......
Apollo:
(I see what you're doing, Daryan. You're "pressing" the prosecution!) ...Your Honor, if we could begin the trial?
Judge:
Yes, it's high time we did. Let's hear your testimony. You may begin with your response to Lamiroir's testimony. If, in fact you have anything to say about it.
Daryan:
Oh I got plenty to say. Lying must be a national pastime in Borginia. ...And wherever you're from, Mr. "Justice". Hah!
Apollo:
...... (Conventional methods are out the window, huh... ...Here goes nothing!)
Witness Testimony
-- Daryan's Rebuttal --
Daryan:
The diva's lying, plain and simple. She's got nothing to back up her story.
In the first place, she never heard my voice!
She "forgot the words because she heard gunshots"? As if!
Didn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?
The shooting took place when I was on stage, man!
Judge:
Hmm... So you claim Lamiroir's testimony was a lie?
Daryan:
Hey, don't get me wrong, I dig what she's doing, trying to protect that kid. And she's got the court eating vague statements out of her hand just 'cause she's blind.
Klavier:
...You go too far, Daryan.
Daryan:
Look, all I'm saying is, you've got a reliable witness. Why not listen to the detective?
Judge:
Detective Skye...? Hmm... I see. Mr. Justice, you may begin the cross-examination.
Apollo:
(He didn't waste any time finding our weak spot... I can't do this with Lamiroir's testimony alone. I'll have to find some other way to prove when the shooting took place!)
Cross Examination
-- Daryan's Rebuttal --
Daryan:
The diva's lying, plain and simple. She's got nothing to back up her story.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You don't have any proof she was lying!
Daryan:
Oh yeah, kid? You saying I lied?
Apollo:
No! I'm just saying, uh...
Trucy:
Apollo! Glare back at him!
Apollo:
(I couldn't help it! I flinched by reflex!) Detective Crescend!
Daryan:
Yeah? What do you want?
Apollo:
Um, n-nothing.
Trucy:
Apollo! Chin up! Back straight! You're wilting!
Apollo:
(This guy's hard as nails! He makes Wocky look downright cooperative.)
Daryan:
Look, there's no way the diva remembers my voice.
Daryan:
In the first place, she never heard my voice!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You never talked to her, even though you were playing in the same concert?
Daryan:
Not a word, as far as I can recall.
Apollo:
But, weren't there planning sessions or something?
Daryan:
Gavin took care of all that himself.
Klavier:
...Daryan wasn't involved in any of the meetings with her.
Apollo:
Ugh...
Daryan:
As if you can just go around remembering everyone's voice like that anyway. Only an idiot would believe that!
Apollo:
(Lamiroir's hearing is very sensitive... She could remember him if she heard him, I'm sure of it... I just can't prove it. And I need proof!)
Daryan:
She "forgot the words because she heard gunshots"? As if!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
We know she missed the words. The mixing board proved it!
Daryan:
Oh, yeah, there was a mistake. But blaming it on gunshots is just a lame excuse.
Apollo:
What do you mean...?
Daryan:
The mixing board proves what? It proves there was a mistake in the song. A missed cue. So? She just flubbed it up, big time. That's all. She spins this story about a gunshot to protect the kid... and cover for her own goof. Man, I'd have to hand it to her... if she wasn't sticking it to me at the same time.
Klavier:
...Daryan, watch what you say. Lamiroir is an artist. She "just flubbed it up"? That's no small accusation for a performer of her caliber.
Daryan:
Heh. She got to you, alright. I can see it in your eyes. I tell you, most of her stuff is so pretentious, it's way over my head.
Apollo:
(I'm detecting a rift in the Gavinners's ranks.)
Daryan:
Anyway, she's too close to the defendant. Her testimony can't be trusted. You ask me, I'd go with Detective Skye's story at the drop of a pick.
Daryan:
Didn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Actually... I was there, too.
Daryan:
So I hear. Which means you heard them, too, right? The gunshots.
Apollo:
Yes. We heard "gunshots". Neither I nor Ema actually saw the shooting, mind you.
Daryan:
...... Heh. I guess you and Lamiroir got the same excuse then.
Klavier:
We know one thing for certain here. There were gunshot-like sounds that emanated from that room during the third set. What we must determine is whether those sounds were actually gunshots.
Trucy:
Machi heard them, too! Remember he said he ran for the air duct when he heard them?
Apollo:
(So... how do we figure out just what those "gunshots" during the third set were?)
Present Igniter or Burnt Fragments
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Some things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.
Judge:
What things?
Apollo:
The first was this small device...
Klavier:
...That's the remote-triggered igniter.
Apollo:
Correct. And... one more thing.
Judge:
What are those? The remains of something burnt? Not another guitar, I hope!?
Klavier:
Traces of gunpowder were found on these fragments. We have a report that it was something like a firecracker.
Apollo:
Eh... (How did Gavin know about this...?)
Klavier:
What? You think Detective Skye works for you? I received the report this morning, before coming here. That's when I made my decision, actually.
Judge:
What decision is this, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
I registered Daryan as a witness in today's trial. ...Just in case.
Daryan:
......
Apollo:
This raises another possibility. Those gunshot-like sounds during the third set... ...could have been two firecrackers rigged to go off by remote control!
Daryan:
Ha ha! You got an active imagination, don't you? But you shouldn't say every little thing you think. Your explanation there seems a bit too convenient to me.
Apollo:
How so?
Daryan:
So, you're saying these firecrackers just happened to go off... ...right when two witnesses came walking by? Hah!
Apollo:
...!
Trucy:
That's right! Daryan was out on stage when it happened, Apollo! How would he know someone was backstage right then!?
Daryan:
If a firecracker goes off in the forest, and there's no one there to hear... You get my drift! Why go through the trouble, man!?
Apollo:
Urk...! (How do I explain this...?)
Klavier:
...He may not look it, but Daryan is a gifted detective. Show any weakness, and he's sure to find it.
Daryan:
"He may not look it", partner? Gee, thanks, man.
Klavier:
...That reminds me. I happened to pass through that very hallway several times that day myself. And I saw something odd there just before the third set.
Apollo:
Something... odd?
Klavier:
A headset. The kind all of the band and staff members were wearing.
Apollo:
...! (That's right! We picked this up in front of the door to that dressing room!)
Klavier:
What if that headset wasn't dropped, but placed? And what if it was turned on?
Apollo:
You could hear what was going on in that hallway! Even if you were out on stage!
Daryan:
Feh... Whose side are you on, Gavin?
Klavier:
Listen to me, Daryan. There are no sides in a court of law.
Daryan:
......
Klavier:
Which is why I now turn to you, Herr Forehead. I've a question for you.
Apollo:
Huh? For me...?
Klavier:
The igniter and the burnt fragments that were found at the scene of the crime... It's certainly a possibility that they were part of a ruse to fake the sound of gunshots. Throw the headset from the hallway into the mix, and you could fabricate an alibi. But we're still no closer to proving anything. Those gunshots might have been real, or fake. We can't say.
Apollo:
Ugh...
Klavier:
You've raised the possibility that the shots heard during the third set were faked. Now you need to prove the other half of the case.
Apollo:
The other half...?
Daryan:
Look, I'll just tell him.
Apollo:
!
Daryan:
He wants you to prove the thing went down in the second act... ...while our little piano player was on stage. That right, Gavin?
Klavier:
Indeed. If you can't prove that... ...then to continue this cross-examination would be pointless.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Justice? Can you prove the crime took place during the second set?
Apollo:
Uh... Yeah, I think...
Trucy:
You'd better know, Apollo! Otherwise we're through...
Apollo:
It can be proven!
Klavier:
...You make it sound like someone else is going to come along and do it for you.
Judge:
Let's continue with the cross-examination then, shall we? Witness, your testimony, if you would.
Apollo:
(This isn't going to be easy. I need some decisive proof, and fast...)
Daryan:
Heh... You ready, kid? 'Cause I am.
Changes statement from "Didn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?" and "The shooting took place when I was on stage, man!" to "The shooting took place during the second set? If you're so sure, let's see your proof."
Daryan:
The shooting took place when I was on stage, man!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
That could have been what the shooter wanted us to think!
Daryan:
I'll tell you what the shooter, that kid, wants you to think. He wants you to think the diva heard me in that room.
Apollo:
(Ack! I'm back to relying on Lamiroir's testimony!)
Klavier:
As much as I'm enjoying the Daryan &amp; Forehead show, there is no need for such tempers.
Apollo:
Don't make us into some comedy duo.
Daryan:
This mean the Gavin &amp; Daryan show's cancelled?
Klavier:
Neither of your claims can be proven... or disproved. We could argue for days like this and get nowhere.
Judge:
Prosecutor Gavin is quite right. This court will hear no further discussion on this topic without new facts.
Apollo:
(New facts, huh...?)
Present Mixing Board
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Remember this, Detective Crescend?
Daryan:
...The mixing board? What about it!?
Apollo:
...It seems there was clear proof left behind. ...Right here in Lamiroir's song.
Daryan:
Her song...!?
Judge:
What exactly is this, erm, device thingy? A new variety of gramophone, perhaps?
Apollo:
(C'mon, we just used this! And don't get me started on "gramophone"!) This device was used to record the performance part by part.
Judge:
Part...?
Klavier:
You move the sliders to adjust the volume. Each instrument is adjustable separately. Lamiroir's voice included.
Judge:
Ho hoh! ...But what does this prove?
Apollo:
According to Lamiroir's testimony... At the moment of the shooting, she forgot the words to the song.
Klavier:
Ah... You intend to examine the recording at that moment, ja? We might even hear those gunshots!
Apollo:
...Exactly.
Daryan:
Hah! Ridiculous. How are you supposed to hear gunshots back in that dressing room out on stage?
Klavier:
Have you forgotten, Daryan? We were all wearing these headsets.
Daryan:
Oh...
Klavier:
We were all deeply involved in our performance... ...but Lamiroir's headset would've picked up what she heard all the same.
Judge:
Then let's get to analyzing that recording! ...Right now!
Apollo:
(Lamiroir stopped singing when she heard the shots fired... Find that spot, and I'll find the gunshots!)
Present Track 1
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Your Honor! Listen closely to this part!"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
Your Honor! Listen to this part!
Judge:
Wh-What's this!? ...... I hear nothing! How is this possible!?
Apollo:
(Wait, isn't the judge hard of hearing?)
Judge:
I can hear just fine, thank you very much!
Apollo:
(Ack! He heard me thinking!)
Judge:
I saw what you were thinking on your face.
Klavier:
Herr Judge's hearing aside, I, too, heard nothing. ...Leading me to believe there is nothing there to be heard.
Apollo:
(Ugh... I guess that's the wrong spot.)
Judge:
A penalty, on behalf of all who are hearing-impaired, you insensitive braggart! Enjoy!
Apollo:
Ugh...
Judge:
Mr. Justice! Once more, if you would!
Leads back to:
"Lamiroir stopped singing when she heard the shots fired...)"
Apollo:
Your Honor! Listen closely to this part! This is the track with Lamiroir's vocals!
When you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.
Pleasure...
Judge:
...I did hear something faintly there, yes! Why... it sounded like a gunshot!
Daryan:
Wh-What!? This has to be some kind of mistake!
Klavier:
Or... the sound was coming over the headset along with her voice.
Daryan:
Gavin... You're crazy, man, crazy! An upstanding prosecutor like you even listening to this weak evidence!? Man, you can barely hear that! How do you know it's a gun?
Klavier:
Perhaps it is you who are hard of hearing, Daryan. It sounds like a gunshot to me.
Apollo:
Admit it! You lost, Detective Crescend!
Daryan:
OK, so what about the gunshots Detective Skye heard? You heard 'em, too, didn't you? Don't even think about telling me you were "mistaken"!
Judge:
Were you thinking of telling him that, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
No, Your Honor. Detective Skye and I clearly heard what sounded like gunshots. But... they weren't!
Judge:
Wh-What!?
Apollo:
And I have evidence that proves it!
Daryan:
......
Klavier:
Then I think you'd best show it to the court. Let's see this evidence!
Judge:
If you would, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
The evidence showing what we really heard... is this!
Present Igniter or Burnt Fragments
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Some things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial."

Apollo:

Judge:
...That's your answer?
Klavier:
And I had such high hopes for you, Herr Forehead...
Judge:
I'm having trouble understanding how that piece of evidence is a gunshot... Next you'll be throwing pie plates in the air and calling them UFOs!
Apollo:
(Even I wouldn't stoop quite that low...) S-Sorry, Your Honor. One more time, please?
Klavier:
Why not. And... get it right this time, hmm?
Leads back to:
"If you would, Mr. Justice!"
Apollo:
Some things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.

Apollo:

Trucy:
We need proof, Apollo! We need to prove that the shooting took place during the second set!
Apollo:
Well, if you know how to do that, I'm all ears.
Trucy:
Maybe the gunshots are the key after all!
Apollo:
What do you mean?
Trucy:
Well, Lamiroir said she heard them, right? Right in the middle of her illusion, when she was up above the ceiling.
Apollo:
...When she forgot the words to the song, yeah.
Trucy:
If you can prove the gun was shot right when she missed those lyrics... ...we're home free, I'd think.
Apollo:
True... Not easy, but true... (Is there some way to prove that...?)
Trucy:
Let's take a look through our evidence! Maybe there's something in there...
Daryan:
...Hey, aren't you supposed to be cross-examining me?

He's pretty eager to paint Lamiroir as a liar, isn't he?
Apollo:
Yeah, because her testimony is basically our entire case.
Trucy:
Hmm... This is tough. So, what do we do?
Apollo:
...I've got a few ideas. (I just need to find another way to prove it didn't happen when he says it did!)
Klavier:
I believe a case has been made. Gunshots were heard during the second set. Which means Lamiroir's testimony... was true.
Daryan:
...Grah!
Judge:
Order! So... she was telling the truth about what she heard?
Lamiroir:
It was the other man speaking, not Mr. LeTouse.
Judge:
Well, what did he say!?
Lamiroir:
"It's over. Press the switch! Now!"
Apollo:
Just after that, there was a gunshot... and then the guitar caught on fire.
Klavier:
Detective Crescend... You weren't on stage during the second set. You could have done it.
Judge:
Hmm... But why did we only hear one gunshot on the recording? Weren't two bullets fired from this weapon?
Apollo:
Lamiroir was moving through the air vent, Your Honor. She must not have been close enough for her mic to catch the first shot. But then, as she passed over the dressing room... ...the gun fired again, and Mr. LeTouse's life was taken. Well, Detective Crescend?
Daryan:
......
Klavier:
Ah, once again I am reminded of something.
Apollo:
...?
Klavier:
Our performance that day...
Judge:
Your performance?
Klavier:
Seeing the mixing board jogged my memory. You were there, too, Herr Forehead.
Klavier:
What is it with today!? Problem after problem! Achtung! My hog won't start. My guitar case is busted... ...my guitar's been burnt to a crisp, and to top it all off, someone's dead! ...And then there was that performance just now. What was that all about!?
Apollo:
This part is off.
Klavier:
Which is that? Hmm... 2nd Guitar.
Daryan:
Ah.

It was you Daryan!

Yeah, well, I...
Judge:
You what? And Prosecutor Gavin, what are you getting at?
Klavier:
I'm talking about the murder weapon. Mr. LeTouse's 45-caliber hand cannon. As we have learned, even the shooter doesn't go unscarred with a revolver that size. The kickback is enough to dislocate your shoulder, if you're an amateur.
Apollo:
Wait...! You mean his playing was affected because he hurt himself shooting that revolver?
Daryan:
Hah! You're forgetting something.
Judge:
Yes, Detective Crescend...?
Daryan:
I am a trained police officer, you know. I've had firearms training. Plenty of it. I'm no amateur.
Klavier:
The standard sidearm issued to police officers is a 38-caliber weapon. A much tamer beast. Also, the murder weapon belonged to the victim, Mr. LeTouse. ...Which suggests there was a struggle between killer and victim.
Judge:
So... the killer might not have been holding the revolver correctly when he fired! Is that what you mean!?
Klavier:
...The thought had occurred to me, yes.
Judge:
Well, does the witness have anything to say to this?
Daryan:
......
Judge:
Detective Crescend!!!
Daryan:
What I want to ask is what Mr. Sleeves-rolled-up-ready-for-action has to say. Hey, you. Attorney.
Apollo:
Me?
Daryan:
Exactly which piece of your evidence is decisive, again? You got a little noise on a tape that could be anything. And you have an alleged guitar cue miss due to a 45-caliber kickback. I weep for this case, Gavin, I really do.
Klavier:
......
Daryan:
You can line up your little weak pieces of evidence all you want. I didn't shoot that manager. And that's the obvious truth.
Judge:
Hmm... The witness has a point. The defense's arguments, while persuasive, are not decisive. I believe we should hear what the witness has to say in response to the case so far. ...Your testimony, please, Detective Crescend. Tell us your reasons why you couldn't have done it!

If I didn't know him, why would I want to kill him!?
Judge:
Hmm. A simple reason, indeed. Prosecutor Gavin. Is it the case that Mr. LeTouse had not been to our country before?
Klavier:
According to our records... Yes. Not even once.

Er, it's not. Don't lick it, please. Detective Crescend. ...Ever seen this?
Daryan:
...Looks like a piece of candy.
Apollo:
What it is... is evidence. Don't lick it before you try it.
Daryan:
......
Apollo:
Specifically, this is a replica of a cocoon... ...It was found among the victim's belongings.
Judge:
A cocoon? Never seen one that color.
Klavier:
It is a variety only found in the Republic of Borginia. Nowhere else.
Judge:
Alright... But what is this cocoon replica doing in my courtroom? Surely, this has nothing to do with a motive for killing Mr. LeTouse! ...Does it?
Apollo:
It does! ...Wait! I mean, I think it does.
Daryan:
...You don't sound so confident, man.
Judge:
A cocoon... Is it one of those silky cocoons? The kind that you can make, well, silk out of?
Apollo:
...Not this one. This cocoon makes a powerful "curative".
Judge:
A curative? For what...?
Klavier:
Apparently, it is most efficacious at treating a disease thought incurable. It is the only medicine of its kind. ...However, it is illegal to take one of these healing cocoons out of Borginia.
Judge:
Whatever for? If it's such a miracle cure, why not share it with the world?
Trucy:
Yeah, that's what I've been wondering!
Klavier:
We looked into the matter at some length. Apparently, it isn't difficult at all to manufacture the remedy from the cocoon. Yet, if you change the process only slightly... ...you can easily make a large quantity of something else entirely. ...A deadly poison, in fact.
Judge:
Wh-What!?
Klavier:
There was an incident, several years ago, where some of these got out onto the black market. It caused quite the commotion in the global community. Though the media was kept largely unaware.
Judge:
Hmm... Intriguing!
Klavier:
All this has led to a strict ban on the cocoons' export. One rigidly enforced... by Interpol, among others.
Judge:
Interpol...
Apollo:
Right! The victim, Romein LeTouse, was an Interpol agent. Detective Crescend! You insist on referring to him as a "manager"... But that is misleading! Romein LeTouse wasn't killed as a manager! He was killed as an undercover agent!
Daryan:
...... So I was trying to smuggle this gumball into the country? That what you're trying to say?
Apollo:
I'm saying that could well be a motive for murder.
Daryan:
Oh, so I was going to sell it on the black market, make myself a pretty penny? ...Ridiculous. I mean, totally unthinkable.
Apollo:
"Unthinkable", you say? Why?
Judge:
Perhaps it's time for another testimony... ...about this "smuggling of cocoons" business!
Witness Testimony
-- Cocoon Smuggling --
Daryan:
International Affairs got a memo about these cocoons.
Interpol's all hot and bothered about 'em.
Can't sell 'em on the black market. Too dangerous.
Yeah, cocoon smuggling ain't exactly lucrative anymore.
Man, I'm in International Affairs! I know the deal!
Judge:
Indeed... Interpol wanted these cocoons bad enough to send Mr. LeTouse undercover.
Daryan:
You kids think up the craziest things... But no way am I going to risk life and limb... ...just to get my hands on some dirty cocoon money!
Judge:
Not the most noble of statements, but duly noted.
Klavier:
According to reports, these cocoons top Interpol's list. Selling them to an underground organization would be risky.

Apollo:
Well, Lamiroir knew about them, though not their use.
Klavier:
My reports indicate that there are ongoing efforts to control information about the cocoons. Most people only know they're illegal to export, that's all.

Can't sell 'em on the black market. Too dangerous.

Believe it, Prosecutor Gavin. What was it that you told me yesterday at your office?
Klavier:
...It was a beautiful instrument. It was played lovingly for many years. A guitar befitting a woman like Lamiroir.
Trucy:
How did it end up here?
Klavier:
I mentioned how much I enjoyed playing it that night, and she made a present of it.
Trucy:
So this guitar is from Borginia?
Klavier:
That it is. We couldn't carry it on the plane. Changes in air pressure and humidity ruin the wood. So, we vacuum packed it in Lamiroir's studio. I used a special shipping service available to me for transporting evidence. They brought it right up to my office for me. ...Pristine and untouched.
Apollo:
Did I get that right, Prosecutor Gavin? "Untouched"?
Klavier:
...Quite. The guitar was wrapped in several sheets and vacuum packed in Borginia. The pack was untouched until the day of the concert. Are you saying that guitar was...

With cocoons this small, it would've been very easy... ...to use your guitar as a mule to smuggle a cocoon out of Borginia!

Ahh... Herr Forehead. At last, it all comes together.
Apollo:
Every strange thing that happened that day. Care to review? Maestro, the gentle sounds of Lamiroir's ballad, if you please.
Klavier:
First... my keys were stolen. A harmless misdemeanor. Which forced me to break the lock on my guitar case.
Apollo:
The key was stolen to retrieve the cocoon from the guitar.
Judge:
I... I see...
Apollo:
But... things didn't go so well. The smuggler wasn't counting on the guitar being wrapped! Only a member of the band could get near that case. Unwrapping the guitar would raise too many suspicions. ...Then the concert began. Right about this time... ...a very large problem presented itself to the smuggler.
Judge:
What's that?
Apollo:
Mr. LeTouse.
Judge:
Ah...!
Klavier:
Mr. LeTouse, an undercover agent, was on to something. He would have known about the guitar. He'd only have to check the shipping records. So... Mr. LeTouse tried to examine the guitar himself.
Apollo:
If the cocoon were confiscated then, the gig would be up. The only thing left for the smuggler to do was to get rid of the whole lot.
...It's over. Press the switch! Now!...
Apollo:
The guitar burst into flames, and the cocoon... was lost. And then... Mr. LeTouse died.

I assure you, no one is more unhappy about this than I. But, I am here to defend him in the murder of Mr. LeTouse. And I stand by my statement earlier that he is innocent of that particular crime.
Judge:
Indeed... the defendant is Borginian. He does meet the basic requirements to be the accomplice. But, what if it was, in fact, Lamiroir?
Apollo:
It couldn't have been.
Judge:
...Well, you seem sure of yourself.
Apollo:
The reason... is electronic signals, Your Honor.
Judge:
Electronic signals...?
Apollo:
Recall that this remote only works to a range of 30 feet. Beyond that, it's useless.
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, that's true.
Apollo:
Now, think back to the testimony... When the shooter made his transmission, Lamiroir was in the air vent. Right above the dressing room where the shooter stood. Let's look at the stage diagram! This is the area that the remote could reach from the air vent.
Judge:
Well, looking at this... ...it seems that Lamiroir still could have done the deed.
Apollo:
No. When the shooter made that transmission... ...the stage was slightly different than shown here. It was in the middle of "The Guitar's Serenade". Part of the stage... was raised. Prosecutor Gavin and the Lamiroir stand-in were in the air! They were on a tower which happens to be 15 feet tall! In other words! The remote couldn't have worked from Lamiroir's position in the air vent!

Right. It's what you hear. We are musicians after all.
Apollo:
...Care to explain for us non-musicians?
Daryan:
Sure thing, punk. Let me get your yarn straight first: You're saying I ordered the wee pianist to set off that igniter? That right?
Apollo:
Y-Yes...?
Daryan:
Well in order to do that, he'd have to press a switch. Am I right?
Apollo:
...OK...
Daryan:
Well, take another listen. Pay attention to the piano.
Apollo:
Piano...?
Pleasure...But a fleeting melodyIt wraps itself around me,And now through the air I fly.
Judge:
What seems to be the problem there? The piano sounded just fine.
Daryan:
And that's the problem! Man, you still don't get it?
Apollo:
Ah...!
Daryan:
Yeah. How's he supposed to hit that switch if he's playing? You've got Ms. Diva, the guitar, the bass, the piano, and the drums... The only one with her hands free was the diva!
Trucy:
Lamiroir...
Daryan:
But according to you... ...she couldn't have been the accomplice, could she?
Apollo:
Urk...!
Daryan:
Your accomplice would have had a hard time helping out... ...if they couldn't even press a switch!
Apollo:
Uh... Uuuuuuuuuurrrrgh! (The piano plays non-stop! He couldn't have pressed that switch...!)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? The piano does seem to be playing when the guitar catches fire.
Apollo:
W-Well...
Daryan:
It's OK. We all make mistakes sometimes.
Trucy:
A-Apollo!? Were you wrong?
Apollo:
I can't be wrong! Everything makes perfect sense! How could it all... just...
Klavier:
...Strange.
Apollo:
Wh-What's strange?
Klavier:
No, it's just... Something's odd about the performance there.
Apollo:
..."Odd"?
Judge:
Mr. Justice. If Machi Tobaye didn't press that switch... ...then he could not be the accomplice you claim he is.
Apollo:
B-But everything points to it! Every fact says he's the accomplice!
Daryan:
...You got the facts wrong, man.
Apollo:
!
Daryan:
Here're some facts for you: Gavin's guitar is on fire. But the pianist didn't press that switch. In other words, your story is full of holes.
Judge:
Mr. Justice, let's hear your final opinion on this matter now. Was the defendant, Machi Tobaye, the accomplice? Your answer will reflect on everything you've said here. Give it some thought.
Trucy:
Apollo! If Machi's not the accomplice... ...then our whole case is ruined!
Apollo:
I know that! It has to be him... He was the only one who could have helped the smuggler... He had to have pressed that switch!
Trucy:
Well, you'd better find a way to prove it!
Apollo:
Argh! What do I do... What do I do!?
Trucy:
Ack... There has to be something that doesn't fit! ...Something odd.
Apollo:
Something odd...! Wait a second...
Trucy:
Wh-What? You thought of something!?
Apollo:
(What was Gavin saying just now...?)
Klavier:
...Strange.
Apollo:
Wh-What's strange?
Klavier:
No, it's just... Something's odd about the performance there.
Apollo:
(...It's not much to go on, but it's all I've got! What exactly did he hear that was "odd"?)
Judge:
Have you come up with something, Mr. Justice? May I remind you that everything rests on this. Can you prove Machi Tobaye pressed that switch? Let's hear your final answer! Can you prove that Machi Tobaye pressed that switch?
I can prove it.
Apollo:
...I don't know if you call this "proof", per se... But... I can prove it was possible!
Leads to:
"Then, as prosecutor, it falls to me to ask you to show us evidence supporting this."
I can't prove it.
Apollo:
I... can't prove it. But... I can prove it was possible!
Leads to:
"Then, as prosecutor, it falls to me to ask you to show us evidence supporting this."
Klavier:
Then, as prosecutor, it falls to me to ask you to show us evidence supporting this. Herr Forehead. You're sure about this?
Daryan:
Hah! Accept it! There's no evidence, man!
Judge:
Let's see your evidence, Mr. Justice. On what do you base your claim that the defendant pressed that switch?
Present Mixing Board
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The basis for my claim... is music, Your Honor."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
The basis for my claim... is this evidence, Your Honor!
Judge:
...I'm not sure I follow.
Daryan:
Hah! You can't bluff your way out of this one!
Klavier:
Nor can you prove anyone pressed the switch with that... "evidence".
Apollo:
(Maybe... I picked the wrong evidence.)
Judge:
For every bluff, there is an equal and opposite penalty!
Apollo:
(Urgh... What did Gavin hear that was "odd"? That's the only hint I've got here. If Machi's hands were tied up playing the piano...)
Judge:
Perhaps you can show us your evidence again?
Leads back to:
"On what do you base your claim that the defendant pressed that switch?"
Apollo:
The basis for my claim... is music, Your Honor.
Judge:
Music? What about music?
Apollo:
Let's listen to the piano part, around the time when the switch was to be pressed... ...right before the guitar burst into flame.
Pleasure...But a fleeting melodyIt wraps itself around me,
Judge:
Hmm... I hear a piano being played.
Apollo:
But... doesn't it sound kind of simple?
Judge:
Simple...?
Klavier:
Ah, I think I know what he's suggesting. You think Machi could have played that part... with one hand?
Judge:
One hand...!?
Apollo:
He only needed one hand to press that switch! He could play the piano with the other!
Daryan:
Hah! What, so you're some kind of piano savant?
Apollo:
Um, actually no.
Daryan:
Then what do you know!? You can't play a part like that with one hand!
Apollo:
Urk...! (Maybe... I don't know what I'm talking about here.) Wait! I know! Hey, Trucy!
Trucy:
Yeah? You got something?
Apollo:
Mr. Wright, your father, he's a pianist! Could he...
Trucy:
Oh, Daddy? He couldn't play a part like that even if he had three hands!
Daryan:
So sorry... So sad for you.
Apollo:
...... ...No. Not really.
Daryan:
H-Huh...?
Apollo:
That was just the easy way to prove it. There's always the hard way.
Daryan:
Man... How are you going to prove whether he played it with one hand or two!? You can't!
Apollo:
I admit, it will be rather difficult to prove. But it's highly likely he was playing with one hand.
Daryan:
H-How do you know that?
Apollo:
The clue is what Prosecutor Gavin described as sounding "odd".
Daryan:
...!
Apollo:
What sounded odd? I'll bet we can tell by listening to a certain part of the song.
Daryan:
No... No way.
Judge:
Well, it seems we've come to the moment of truth at last. Let's hear what Mr. Justice has to say for himself. Show us the part that proves the defendant was playing with one hand... ...right before the guitar burst into flame!
Apollo:
(Machi was definitely playing one-handed just before the guitar caught fire! And one section of the song proves it!)
Present Section 1
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Prosecutor Gavin... I'm sure you've realized by now..."
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
That's the section? Hmm... I'm afraid I don't hear it. What's your opinion as an artist, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
It's a beautiful song. And the lyrics... are outstanding.
Judge:
I'll take that to mean there isn't a problem with this section at all.
Apollo:
(Wait, so what was the "odd" thing that Gavin heard? The switch was pressed in the first half of the second verse, right? I know! I just need to find a place to compare to that!) Your Honor! If you'll give me one more chance, I think I can find it!
Judge:
I suppose we don't have a choice. Very well. You claim the defendant was playing with one hand when the switch was pressed... Show us the part that proves it!
Leads back to:
"Machi was definitely playing one-handed just before the guitar caught fire!"
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin... I'm sure you've realized by now... ...just what it was that sounded "odd" to you.
Klavier:
As I'm sure you've realized it yourself, Herr Forehead.
Judge:
R-Realized what?
Apollo:
I'll demonstrate. Let's listen to the part in question again, shall we? Pay particular attention to the "But a fleeting melody" phrase.
Pleasure...But a fleeting melody
Daryan:
Man, man, man! How many times do we have to listen to the same thing?
Apollo:
You're right. Enough of that!
Daryan:
...!
Apollo:
Let's listen to another section, shall we?
Judge:
Another section...?
Apollo:
The guitar burst into flame at the end of the second verse. Let's listen to the same spot... in the first verse. Pay attention to "O that night in your embrace"...!
Sugar, Sugar...O that night, in your embrace.
Judge:
Ah...! P-Play verse two again!
Pleasure...But a fleeting melody
Apollo:
There! Did you hear that?
Judge:
They "feel" the same, true... ...but they're clearly very different!
Daryan:
Whaaat!?
Apollo:
Well put, Your Honor! The phrase in verse two is quite simple... But the same phrase in verse one has high and low notes! You'd have to use two hands to play that for sure!
Judge:
Ah...!
Daryan:
Urk... Hrrah! Wh-What's that prove!?
Apollo:
I would think you'd know that by now.
Daryan:
This is why I hate dealing with amateurs, man... So the two verses had different arrangements! Happens all the time.
Klavier:
Not this time, Daryan.
Daryan:
...!
Klavier:
There's no point in changing an arrangement if you can't hear it clearly. And that wasn't the point. I had him play specifically so that the piano would stay in the background.
Daryan:
Oh. Ohhhhh!
Klavier:
That was what I noticed. "Why should the same phrase sound slightly different?" I asked myself.
Apollo:
Now ask yourselves why Machi changed how he played... and there's only one answer! He needed a free hand in order to press the switch!
Daryan:
Unh... Unnnnoooooooooork!
Judge:
Order! Order!! Order!!!!! I believe this ties all the facts together... Well, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
Yes, quite. Though, personally, this comes as a terrible disappointment.
Daryan:
...Heh...
Apollo:
(What? No comeback...? I can't believe it! I finally did it! I shut him up!)
Judge:
Very well. Barring an objection from the prosecution... I will now state the court's opinion on this matter...
Daryan:
Heh... Heh heh heh... Ah ha ha ha ha ha haaaah! Good show, Sleeves. No, great show!
Apollo:
...It's not over? (I don't like it when he looks so... so happy.)
Daryan:
You tell him Gavin. Tell him what's so disappointing!
Klavier:
Personally, I'm terribly disappointed... ...in you, Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
Huh... M-Me!?
Klavier:
Yes. Don't get me wrong, your case is solid. The facts all check out. But, even now... ...you have yet to show us a single piece of decisive evidence.
Apollo:
Yeah, but the facts... Anyone can see it was him!
Judge:
Unfortunately, "anyone" does not include the law. I'm afraid your case doesn't cut it.
Apollo:
But... But...
Judge:
A thousand facts might point toward the same conclusion... ...but without decisive evidence, it's not proof. That's the rule under our current legal system.
Apollo:
I don't believe it...!
Judge:
It does not seem as though the defense has any more evidence to present.
Daryan:
Oh, I think if he did we already would have seen it a long ways back.
Judge:
It is unfortunate... ...but, at present, this court is unable to acknowledge your accusation.
Apollo:
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaat!? (The truth is staring us all right in the face! Why can't they see it!? What's the point of a legal system that protects criminals!?)
Trucy:
Apollo! Remember what Daddy said?
Phoenix:
It won't be easy proving he did it. Especially not under the current court system...
Apollo:
So what do I do!?
Phoenix:
Like I said. Good luck. And be aware that it will be impossible to prove his guilt by conventional methods.
Apollo:
Ugh...
Phoenix:
Every man has an igniter inside him. Find Daryan Crescend's igniter... and set it off.
Trucy:
I wonder what he meant by every man's "igniter"?
Apollo:
I think he just meant a weak spot, no? The kind of thing that a single spark could turn into a wildfire of emotion... (I won't be able to press him further by conventional means... I've got to find a weak spot in this guy... Something fatal...)
Daryan:
...So, can I get back to work now, or what? It may look like I got a lot of time on my hands... ...but I got no more time to play pretend with this deadweight attorney.
Judge:
Hmm. Well, Mr. Justice? We've come this far without decisive evidence... ...This witness won't be coming back to the stand once we let him go.
Apollo:
...Every man has an igniter.
Daryan:
Huh...?
Apollo:
Didn't you say "the better the guitar, the brighter it burns", Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
Ah, yes. Good guitars are kept dry, is why. That provides the best sound.
Apollo:
Even a small spark could cause irreparable damage. Your plan has an "igniter" in it, too, Detective. ...It was there from the very beginning.
Daryan:
What...?
Apollo:
(Fightin' time, Justice. If you blow this one... ...he'll be out of your hands for good...)
Trucy:
Go for it, Apollo!
Daryan:
What, and this igniter's supposed to come "burn" me up? That's almost poetic there, Mr. Attorney.
Klavier:
All the better. I'm rather fond of poetry... And I intend to hear this one through to the very end.
Daryan:
...!
Klavier:
Herr Forehead. You are accusing this man, Daryan Crescend of two crimes: The murder of Mr. LeTouse, and the smuggling of a Borginian Cocoon. ...This is your last chance to prove your case.
Judge:
This trial has already run on for far too long. Mr. Justice, this will be my last warning. The moment this "igniter" of yours turns out to be a dud... ...is the moment this cross-examination ends. ...Understood?
Apollo:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Then, let's have it. Show us the basis for these accusations against Daryan Crescend!
Apollo:
(OK... This is really my last chance! The key that will take apart Daryan Crescend's plan is...)
Present evidence
Apollo:
The defense is prepared to show the court evidence!
Daryan:
Hah! Be my guest!
Judge:
Be all of our guests, Mr. Justice. Show us evidence supporting your accusations against Daryan Crescend!
Present anything
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...This is your igniter?"
Judge:
...This is your igniter?
Daryan:
Bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha!!! So, exactly how am I suppose [sic] to react to that?
Apollo:
(Ack! He's not flustered at all! I picked a dud...)
Klavier:
I'm afraid your poetic tale ended up to be mere fantasy.
Judge:
...Reality bites, Mr. Justice. Penalty!
Apollo:
(Ow ow ow...)
Judge:
I suppose we should let you try once more... Show us the basis for your accusations against Daryan Crescend!
Apollo:
(Think, Justice! Are you sure about this...?)
Leads back to:
"The key that will take apart Daryan Crescend's plan is...)"
Call a witness
Apollo:
Your "igniter" isn't a piece of evidence.
Daryan:
Huh? So what is...
Apollo:
It is true that I couldn't show decisive evidence. But perhaps what I needed to prove my case was something else.
Klavier:
You mean... a witness.
Apollo:
Proving his guilt is a tall order... ...but I've got just the person to do it.
Judge:
...Very well, Mr. Justice. Who is this person who can prove Daryan Crescend's guilt?
Present Machi Tobaye profile
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The one person who can prove Daryan Crescend's guilt..."
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
...This person... is your "igniter"?
Daryan:
Hah! Exactly what are they going to testify about!? Go for it! Call 'em to the stand!
Apollo:
(He's... not scared at all, is he? *sigh* Wrong person.) I'm sorry... it was an honest mistake. One more try, Your Honor?
Judge:
The court advises you to be aware that your chances are limited in number. I think you're the one in need of a little igniting!
Apollo:
(Ugh...)
Judge:
I suppose we should let you try once more... Show us the basis for your accusations against Daryan Crescend!
Apollo:
(Think, Justice! Are you sure about this...?)
Leads back to:
"The key that will take apart Daryan Crescend's plan is..."
Apollo:
The one person who can prove Daryan Crescend's guilt... ...is the defendant, Machi Tobaye!
Judge:
Y-Your client? Again!?
Apollo:
Machi Tobaye was an accomplice to the cocoon smuggling plot. Without him, Daryan Crescend could not have gotten the cocoon. Furthermore, he can easily prove that the one who plotted to smuggle that cocoon... ...is the real criminal in this case!
Judge:
Hmm... How so?
Apollo:
It would require just one of the very cocoons Mr. LeTouse was looking for. With the cooperation of the Republic of Borginia, we could burn a cocoon. The burnt cocoon would leave a particular residue. A residue we would, no doubt, also find inside the burnt-out guitar!
Judge:
Aha! Very scientific of you.
Apollo:
Thus, if Machi Tobaye acknowledges his agreement with Daryan Crescend... ...concerning the attempted smuggling of a Borginian Cocoon... ...the case is solved!
Daryan:
Heh... Heh heh heh heh heh!
Trucy:
Um, Daryan's laughing again...
Daryan:
Your unrelenting passion is... remarkable. You really want to get me, don't you? ...Too bad you'll never be able to.
Apollo:
...Why not?
Daryan:
The little key-tickler won't acknowledge anything! Especially not anything to do with cocoon smuggling!
Judge:
What's this all about?
Klavier:
Taking a cocoon out of the country means death... ...by Borginian law.
Trucy:
Ah...
Daryan:
Yeah! See? If our pianist really was a smuggler... ...then testifying about it would be suicide! ...Believe me, he's not talking--
Apollo:
But you're wrong, Detective Crescend.
Daryan:
...What...?
Apollo:
It's the other way around! If Machi doesn't admit to smuggling here... He's in deep trouble!
Daryan:
Huh? H-How?
Apollo:
Look, if Machi admits to smuggling here... ...then he'll be tried in our courts, by our laws. You don't get the death penalty for smuggling in our country.
Daryan:
Ah...
Apollo:
The victim in this case was an undercover Interpol agent. I'm sure that news has already reached Borginia.
Klavier:
And they'll likely broadcast our dealings in court today. ...Including the part about the Borginian Cocoon.
Daryan:
Yeah but... but... But...!
Apollo:
But, if Machi doesn't admit to smuggling now... ...he'll eventually be picked up by the Borginian police. And it's not like he's in any danger in our court. We're not going to find him guilty of murder here, not now!
Daryan:
Yeah, but... you can't do this! You can't... You can't accuse me!
Apollo:
Maybe the "law" doesn't allow it... But who's going to think you're really innocent after hearing this trial? ...The same goes for Machi Tobaye.
Daryan:
...Urk...!
Apollo:
The cocoon smuggling, your entire plan... ...Machi Tobaye knows everything. There's only one way out of it for him. And that's to acknowledge his own crime! The crime of cocoon smuggling!
Daryan:
...... ...... Heh. D-Don't worry, there. I'll get... I'll get you out of the country. I'll set you up someplace. A hidden mansion? Real nice. You want a house made out of cookies? Or no, a house made out of pianos? C'mon... ...Please! Don't taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalk!
Klavier:
...Daryan. I consider that my last session with you. ...We rocked.
Apollo:
...I'm guessing we can treat that outburst as a confession?
Daryan:
...Heh...heh heh heh...
Trucy:
Uh oh, he's laughing again.
Apollo:
There's a kind of sick desperation in it now, though.
Judge:
Well... have you been listening to today's trial?
Machi:
...Yes.
Judge:
And you'll talk? You [sic] tell this court everything?
Machi:
......
Apollo:
I didn't want it to turn out this way. But... I'm not the kind of lawyer that can overlook a crime.
Klavier:
Today's trial... was all for your benefit, you know? I see no reason why you should hesitate now.
Machi:
...I knew. From beginning, I knew.
Apollo:
Machi...
Machi:
Situation... I cannot explain. But money. I needed. Very much money.
Judge:
Today's trial... ...raises a delicate issue with our legal system. "The only thing definite in a court of law... ...is evidence." This is the golden rule. However...
Klavier:
...It has become apparent that not all things can be tried by this standard.
Judge:
Should another case of this sort surface... ...we may have to consider an alternate system by which to administer justice. ...Anyway, Mr. Machi Tobaye?
Machi:
...Yes?
Judge:
I promise you will receive a fair trial by the laws of our country. And, with regards to the current charges for the murder of Mr. LeTouse... ...this court is prepared to announce a verdict.
Machi:
...I thank you. I... only lie. But you see truth! You find... truth.
Judge:
...That's our job. Very well...! This court finds the defendant, Machi Tobaye...
Not Guilty
Judge:
Court is adjourned!
July 10, 4:42 PM
District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Trucy:
I wonder what'll happen to Machi...
Apollo:
Well, he did smuggle a cocoon out of Borginia. I guess there'll be another trial here...
???:
All's well that ends well.
Trucy:
Daddy...!
Lamiroir:
I owe you both my thanks.
Apollo:
Lamiroir...?
Lamiroir:
My, is something wrong?
Apollo:
I'm sorry...! I... Machi was your partner on stage! Your friend...!
Lamiroir:
...... Yes. I thought of him as my own son. Even now, I do. Yet... Something got ahold of him, something evil. I see that. And he must pay for what he has done. Is that not how it should be?
Apollo:
I'm still sorry...
Lamiroir:
Do not be sorry. You have given me courage.
Trucy:
Courage...?
Lamiroir:
I am considering an eye operation.
Phoenix:
It was my suggestion, actually.
Trucy:
You mean, you'll be able to see again?
Lamiroir:
It's funny. I have always been afraid of the "light". Light seems so harsh, so unforgiving...
Phoenix:
According to the doctor... ...Lamiroir lost her sight due to some kind of "accident".
Apollo:
An accident...?
Lamiroir:
As you know, I suffer from amnesia. I feared that, if I could see... ...perhaps it would open my eyes to the truth I have been running from. ...I was scared.
Phoenix:
You know what changed her mind? Hearing your defense in there today. She could feel your gaze, unwavering, always looking straight at the truth.
Lamiroir:
...If the light returns to my eyes... ...I think I will take up painting.
Apollo:
Painting...?
Trucy:
That's right! She's the "landscape painter in sound", after all!
Lamiroir:
I will paint the two of you. I promise.
Trucy:
Woo hoo! I can't wait, Lamiroir!
Phoenix:
I owe you my thanks, too, Apollo.
Apollo:
Uh, thanks, Mr. Wright, but for what?
Phoenix:
You reminded me I need to hurry things along. ...On my secret mission, that is.
Apollo:
Right. Your secret mission.
Lamiroir:
Apollo, Trucy... I hope that we will meet again someday soon.
Trucy:
You bet! Me, too!
Apollo:
(And so, like a ballad, the trial flowed on and on... until it came to the end. Thanks to the trial... ..."The Guitar's Serenade" was a huge hit. Prosecutor Gavin's even more dazzling to look at now. But... there's something I want to say to that guy. Next time you write a ballad...)
Trucy:
...Have them catch the killer at the end!
THE END
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Apollo:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
...You don't sound very sure, Mr. Justice. Objection overruled.
Apollo:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Apollo:
They aren't, are they...?
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Justice, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Apollo:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts the evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Apollo:
...Um... You sure about that?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
(Ack! That didn't go so well.)
Perceive wrong area (during cross-examination segment "Proof of Innocence", on statement "He says that because the lyrics are in English, he does not understand them.")
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Apollo:
Machi... you're not telling us the entire truth. I can see it as clear as day!
Lamiroir:
Perhaps... my interpretation is at fault...? Now he says, "I have no idea what you're talking about."
Trucy:
Apollo! Neither of them looks uncertain at all!
Klavier:
Lamiroir, it is not your interpretation that is to blame here. It is the lack of anything resembling intelligence in that wide forehead you see.
Machi:
...... Hee hee.
Apollo:
You didn't have to interpret that for him! (Hmm. Looks like I pointed at the wrong spot...)
Perceive wrong area (during cross-examination segment "Proof of Innocence", on statement "It was I who explained that the crime followed the song.")
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Apollo:
Did you know that the body reveals our thoughts? And yours is telling me you were uncertain just now!
Lamiroir:
...... Ah, should I be interpreting this, or not?
Apollo:
...Yes! Of course!
Lamiroir:
I must admit, I find it hard to interpret that which makes no sense.
Trucy:
Um, maybe you got it wrong, Apollo? Just a thought...
Apollo:
You might have a point there, Trucy.
Apollo:
Um, no need to interpret that after all, Lamiroir...
Lamiroir:
Oh, I'm sorry, I've already told him.
Machi:
...... Hee hee.
Apollo:
(...Great, now even my client's laughing at me. Guess that was the wrong spot after all...)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Machi Tobaye...
Guilty
Judge:
The defendant will surrender himself to the court's care... ...to undergo a regular trial at the High Court within a month's time. Court is adjourned!
