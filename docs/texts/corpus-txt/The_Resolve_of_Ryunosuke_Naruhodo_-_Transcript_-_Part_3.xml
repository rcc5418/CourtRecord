<title>The Resolve of Ryunosuke Naruhodo</title>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Before we begin today, I have a brief announcement. As with the closed trial ten years ago, some astonishing facts have come to light in these proceedings. The revelation that the well known 'Reaper' is actually an organisation illegally executing its own brand of justice. And the discovery that a respected Yard inspector was at its heart until he himself perished in an assassination plot. Well...I say to all members of the judiciary here present on this occasion... ...that we will stop at nothing to uncover the whole truth behind these disturbing findings! Counsels...you will undertake this trial with the resolve to pursue the truth to the bitter end!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Resolve, yes... That's my intention.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My Lord, if I may enquire...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The defendant may speak.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">On what grounds is Kazuma Asogi permitted to continue in his role as prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">He has admitted to colluding with the victim in a plot to assassinate an innocent man. He shouldn't be enjoying the privilege of freedom, let alone be leading the prosecution.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I submitted a written petition to Lord Stronghart... ...requesting that judgement of my transgressions be delayed by one day.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You did what?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">In today's proceedings...I intend to expose everything. My whole life for the last ten years...has all been leading up to this one day!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Whatever the outcome of this trial... ...I give my word that I will accept whatever punishment is deemed appropriate. However severe. And I suggest you prepare yourself for the same...Reaper!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Kazuma is bristling with hostility today. I get the distinct impression we're heading into very dangerous territory...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Is that really even Kazuma-sama standing before us?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">As an extreme exception to normal practices, I have granted this prosecutor's request. The defence finds this acceptable...I presume?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">In that case, in the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again. We resume the closed hearing...of Barok van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence is ready, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The prosecution is more than ready.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Very well, then. This preamble has taken long enough. Prosecutor Asogi...begin!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...As you wish, My Lord. The prosecution calls the first witness to the stand. Bring Seishiro Jigoku into the courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>At last, then...we've reached the final battle. He's putting literally everything on the line now in order to get to the truth. Come on, Ryunosuke. It's time for that steely resolve. Because this is going to test it to the limit!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Witness, state your name and occupation for the court.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Haah... So it was you who issued this, was it?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Your subpoena? ...I did what was necessary.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Hah hah hah hah hah hah! Well, look what the young man has become! I didn't think I'd see the day when you'd take that tone with me, I must say.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The witness will ensure his responses are pertinent to the questions asked.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">......... My name is Seishiro Jigoku, a Supreme Court judge from the Empire of Japan..</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Sixteen years ago, this man came to London as a visiting student. Six years later, he returned to Japan. As well as presiding over the Supreme Court, he is also currently Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I am of course fully aware of Mr Jigoku and his pre-eminent roles. I invited him personally to the International Forensic Science Symposium as a representative of his country. I hear he also played a key role in the conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Friendship and Navigation.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Ah, it was a great honour to be involved in the negotiations. I put my all into that treaty.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge Jigoku! I must ask...</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Well I never... Fancy the young murdering student turning up here of all places.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You acquitted me yourself... And now I'm a practising defence lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Yes...and full of self-importance like your friend across the courtroom, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You came here to London by invitation to the International Forensic Science Symposium. But then, without informing anyone of your plans, you took flight to France.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Took flight? I'd have to object to that turn of phrase.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then explain yourself! What exactly were the circumstances?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Well...I was somewhat expecting this. And I'm sorry to say... ...I decline to comment.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Leaving the country prematurely when I was an invited guest may be questionable etiquette... ...but my decision is unrelated to this case. I can't be bound to testify.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Unrelated, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I appreciate that a respected police inspector has been killed, for which I offer my condolences. However, being an alien, I'd obviously never met the man. Nor do I know the first thing about him. As such, I'm in no position to testify. It's as simple as that.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So you would run from all this?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This case is more far-reaching than the murder of Inspector Gregson. It has ties to another murder. A case that was tried in Japan almost a year ago now.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">A year ago in Japan... The murder of Dr John H. Wilson, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right! And you, Judge Jigoku, are at the heart of both cases! The defence has evidence to prove it.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Well, Ryunosuke... I see from the look in your eyes... ...that you're resolved to carry this through to the very end, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Let's see your evidence, then. What proof do you have that Seishiro Jigoku is involved in this case?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This piece of evidence...is a welcome present to the courthouse, with the compliments of the defence!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You have a poor grasp of British court etiquette, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">That's the extent of your resolve? You disappoint me...Ryunosuke Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAGH!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Stand tall, Mr Naruhodo! That was a minor blow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Having your best friend tell you he's disappointed in you really stings, though... <thought>But of course we have evidence that ties Judge Jigoku to this case. Evidence showing a few key names, even!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Good. There's still plenty of fight in your eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is a telegram detailing a communication sent between Britain and Japan approximately one year ago. The communication contained four names: K. Asogi, A. Shinn... ...T. Gregson and J. Wilson.</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">You, you little... Where did you get that?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In Tokyo...from your office, Judge Jigoku.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">What?! How on earth did you...?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What's this all about? Why is my name on that list?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This list of four names follows a certain pattern. T. Gregson and J. Wilson are the names of victims. K. Asogi and A. Shinn...are the names of assassins.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">No...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">A. Shinn and her victim J. Wilson...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And the murder that just took place here in London was the counterpart to that crime. An assassin sent from Japan, also a visiting student: Kazuma Asogi... ...whose victim was the British police inspector Tobias Gregson.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">K. Asogi and T. Gregson... One assassin from each country to kill a target residing in the other.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... What exactly is the defence suggesting?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">These two cases of murder, one that took place in Britain and one in Japan... ...were masterminded by a pair of individuals from each country as a form of assassin exchange! And the telegram the defence has acquired is proof of this international 'contract' to kill!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Wha...WHAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The telegram was found in your office, Judge Jigoku! In other words, the mastermind in Japan...was you!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Judge Jigoku...? What's this all about?!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And you, Kazuma... You lied.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">During yesterday's proceedings, you acknowledged that you'd accepted the assassination mission. But the mark wasn't Judge Jigoku at all. It was 'T. Gregson', Detective Inspector of Scotland Yard... ...as shown by the name on the killing contract!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">......... Very impressive, Ryunosuke. But actually, I didn't lie.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The name of the target I was ordered to kill never passed my lips yesterday. The idea that Seishiro Jigoku was the mark...came entirely from you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! <thought>You...deliberately avoided saying his name...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The defence claims these four names indicate some sort of international assassin exchange? I'm sure I speak for all present when I say that the very idea seems utterly absurd. Well, Mr Jigoku? What do you have to say for yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">His silence only goes to prove his guilt!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There's another very important point that this new development brings to light. There's now a distinct possibility that the scene of Inspector Gregson's actual murder... ...was in the witness's cabin aboard the SS Grouse!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge Jigoku, you have to testify now! To refuse would put you in contempt of court!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">......... Hah hah hah hah hah hah! There's no need for quite such a vicious stare, young man! Very well, then. As a parting gift to you all, I'll tell you everything I know.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... It seems this Japanese gentleman has information that the court must hear. About the alleged 'assassin exchange' and the events of the night of the 31st October. Present your formal testimony now.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">...As you wish, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">It's true that Kazuma Asogi was assigned the assassination mission one year ago now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you admit it, then? As this communication suggests... ...there really was an assassin exchange arrangement between Britain and Japan!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">A political endeavour at the highest levels. Not something I can discuss here.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">To use such a worthy practice as foreign study to coerce somebody to commit murder... It's the most appalling thing I've ever heard!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Appalling? Well, it's easy to judge...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Asogi had a reason for taking his sword to that British inspector, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Which is why he accepted the mission in the first place. Isn't that right...Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Kazuma-sama...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge Jigoku, if you are the mastermind behind this operation in Japan... ...then tell the court the identity of your counterpart in Britain!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">......... I'm not obliged to divulge that information.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">As I said yesterday, I've killed nobody. I freely admit that I accepted the mission, but on the night the plan was to be executed, I backed out. In short, this assassin exchange that the defence has identified is unrelated to the events of this case.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">The crucial point is this: Your police inspector can't have perished aboard that steamship in Dunkirk. Because if he'd been shot in the cabin, it's inconceivable that a member of the crew wouldn't have heard it.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">That's right. Gregson was killed after returning to London. In the room on Fresno Street. And the perpetrator of the crime was the Reaper, Barok van Zieks! The prosecution's accusation remains unchanged.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...To think that a seemingly innocent foreign exchange programme was a façade for such Machiavellian dealings. Clearly it's a plot only a government minister and high-ranking judge such as the witness could hope to execute.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Well, I seem to recall that it was someone on the British side who...controlled everything.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Be that as it may, it is not the place of this court to pursue this villainous assassin exchange plot. We are concerned only with the tangible events pertaining to the murder of Inspector Gregson. ...Is the defence clear on that point, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Yes, My Lord. I'll keep that in mind as I cross-examine the witness.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">It's true that Kazuma Asogi was assigned the assassination mission one year ago now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A year ago...when Kazuma was still in Japan, then.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Correct. It was at the examination centre for applicants for the study tour that I approached him.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I'll never forget it. I remember exactly what you said. You just came out and asked me forthright if I'd consider travelling to Britain on an assassination mission.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Surely not...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I thought it was a joke at first, of course. But then... ...it was made clear to me that if I didn't accept, I wouldn't be considered for the study tour.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, so you agreed to it...just for that?! I mean, I know how much you wanted to study in England, but...assassination?!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">The Empire of Japan had accepted a proposal from the British Empire at the time. An agreement to send a student from each country to the other's to deepen cultural understanding and friendship. But behind the scenes, the chosen students were to be given assassination missions. I...had no choice but to accept the proposal that originated from my British counterpart.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Why? Why didn't you expose the plot there and then?!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Britain acknowledges no part in these alleged misbegotten dealings. I advise you not to make spurious allegations... Foreign Minister Jigoku.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">As a witness, I am bound to tell the truth...My Lord. Anyway, I picked Asogi, and explained the details of the plan to him.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">The target was Inspector T. Gregson. That was a condition of the British study tour.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why Kazuma? Why did you pick him as the assassin?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">He was the most capable of all the applicants. And in addition... ...I knew his desire to travel to Britain was very strong. In fact, it was almost more than a desire. It was his whole purpose in life.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes, as his best friend, I can certainly attest to that. The way he threw himself into his studies... The way he pursued becoming qualified as a lawyer... It was all ultimately for that one single goal of being accepted on a study tour to Britain.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">And of course, we know the reason behind that. He was determined to find out for himself the truth about his father, Genshin Asogi.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">There's nothing I wouldn't have done to get here. Be that agreeing to assume the role of an assassin... or betraying people's trust.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Well, you certainly did a fine job of betraying mine, Asogi.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But why was Inspector Gregson the target?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I have no idea. Those were the orders from Britain. I was in no position to question them.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You have no idea? Really? I find that hard to believe.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Oh do you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Judge Jigoku was once a visiting student here in Britain himself, of course. Perhaps he has some connection with Inspector Gregson from that time...</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">The defence really ought to catch up.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">With what?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">With the fact that the assassin exchange has absolutely nothing to do with the case under scrutiny here. Yes, I've already admitted to recruiting Asogi...</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">However...in the end something happened that meant the young man was unable to carry out his mission.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I presume you're referring to the incident that occurred during Kazuma's passage to Britain in January? The awful 'tragedy' that took place on the steamship...</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Word arrived at the ministry some two weeks after the ship's departure from our shores. The visiting student had been killed, but his body had somehow gone missing in Hong Kong. The news was wired to me from a detective I'd placed on the ship to accompany the assassin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Obviously, Kazuma didn't actually die at all. But he did lose his memory. Including all details about his special mission.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Did you not consider dispatching another assassin at that point?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">That wasn't possible. Simply because... ...that black-clad young student over there had already put himself forward as Asogi's replacement. And there was no way to stop him from reaching Britain.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">My hands were completely tied.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So Mr Sholmes's strategy worked perfectly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He, he predicted everything that would happen...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Months later, my memory returned. But I'd never intended to go through with the assassination mission anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">So you were playing me right from the outset, were you? Is that it?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I'd sooner be guilty of that crime than of taking someone else's life. I was prepared to do whatever I had to in order to get myself here to Britain.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">This line of questioning has gone on long enough.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">All the court should be concerned about in the testimony given by this witness... ...are details relating to his relationship with Inspector Gregson, and the victim's murder.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">In that case... ...as I've already made perfectly clear, I had no connection to the man or his death!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And you have some means of substantiating this plea?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">On the evening in question, a member of the crew was on duty outside my cabin at all times.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Outside your cabin in the first-class area of the SS Grouse, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Yes, that's right. Not least because there was a 'murder' of a student passenger earlier in the year, I imagine... ...the liner operators have taken to posting a crewman outside every first-class cabin door.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I can confirm the presence of the crewman guard myself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Because I accompanied Inspector Gregson to Dunkirk that night, I witnessed it with my own eyes. There was a well-built crewman standing guard directly in front of the door to the witness's cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">At that particular time, of course, I'd gone to the ship's dining room for dinner.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The inspector and I asked the crewman to allow us into the cabin while we waited for Judge Jigoku's return.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose Inspector Gregson was there in his capacity as the Reaper... He was intending to take the witness's life.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Exactly. As I've said numerous times now, I had no intention of killing anyone.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So the crewman let two potential assassins into the cabin he was supposed to be guarding? Not the most convincing of sentries, really.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">In truth, those were my thoughts, too. But anyway, I stayed to talk with Inspector Gregson for a short while... ...and then I left him there and made my way off the ship alone.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Was the guard still at the door when you went?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Yes. He glared at me as I walked past.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">You see? That proves it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">If there'd been a shot fired, the crewman would have heard it. So clearly I can't be involved.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The crewman who was standing directly outside your cabin door, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">That's right. A muscular man with a permanent grim expression on his face. He didn't once move from that spot. To be honest, I thought he was a miserable fellow. But as it happens, he's a vital witness now!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">There's no doubt that Gregson was killed by a gunshot. And it's inconceivable that a crewman standing just outside the cabin door wouldn't have heard that.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But wait! What about the ship's enormous steam engines? The noise of them could have drowned out the sound of the gun being fired!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Sadly, young judicial assistant, that won't wash.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">You will recall that my cabin was in the first-class area of the ship, which is also of course, the quietest. Don't imagine for a moment that it's anything like steerage where the judicial assistants go!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I, I didn't mean...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But a hole like that made by a bullet was found in your cabin, Judge Jigoku! That's compelling evidence that a gun was fired in there!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What's that? A bullet hole...?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Oh yes. You're talking about what the detective uncovered in the wall yesterday, I presume. That was obviously a rotten panel eaten out by woodworm. [sic] No doubt he didn't find an actual bullet.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... <thought>That's the hole in this argument...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Sadly, I was unable to arrange for the crewman to be brought back to Britain with me. But obviously, if a gun had been fired in my cabin on the night in question as the defence implies... ...I would have been arrested on the spot, and would never have made it to Britain in the first place!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Very true. The witness's logic is sound. Since no gunshot was heard from the witness's cabin on the night in question... ...we must assume that the witness is telling the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Heh heh heh... I'm glad you've seen sense, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I know Kazuma's already admitted to taking on this incredible assassination plot, but even so... ...hearing it confirmed by somebody else is still a real shock.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's unforgivable! Using Kazuma-sama's feelings to manipulate him into agreeing to such a despicable plan...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But I think Kazuma manipulated Judge Jigoku, too. He completely double-crossed him.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear... It's hard not to see that as a stroke of brilliance on Kazuma-sama's part...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>One way or another, though, Gregson ended up dead.</thought> I really think that the murder must have happened aboard that steamship.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So you mean...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge Jigoku must be lying.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I know I shouldn't let my emotions cloud my judgement... ...but you must destroy him, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, as the court has heard, there was a crewman posted outside Judge Jigoku's cabin. However, we can be sure that, contrary to the witness's claim... ...the guard wasn't there at all times.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I have here a notice of a particular event that was scheduled to take place aboard the steamship on the 31st.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Wha...?! Where did you get that?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's evidence gathered by Mr Herlock Sholmes. You were acquainted yesterday, if you remember.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Herlock Sholmes again...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">According to this itinerary... ...after leaving the Port of Dunkirk, at exactly 10 p.m., and for a period of twenty minutes... ...all crewmen of the SS Grouse were to gather on deck for an evacuation drill.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">All crewmen were...away from their posts?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And during that twenty-minute interval of course... ...any gunshots emanating from your cabin would have been heard by no one!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In summary, Judge Jigoku... ...you had ample opportunity to commit the crime!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Argh!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">A twenty-minute window of opportunity... That's an excellent find, Ryunosuke. But it amounts to nothing!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Because the witness clearly stated in his testimony that no incident occurred in his cabin. Unless you have some decisive evidence that can show his testimony to be false... ...your accusation is nothing more than conjecture!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Very true. Well, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Inspector Gregson was killed in Judge Jigoku's cabin that night. I'm certain of it. Because the defence has the evidence to prove it.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You will present the evidence for the defence at once, Counsel. What proof do you have that the victim's life was taken in Jigoku's cabin on the 31st October?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Stronghart:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no no! That evidence was presented after careful consideration, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Then I'd suggest you take a little longer over your deliberation in future. Otherwise you may find... ...that you're the one being sent for incineration!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAAAAGH! <thought>Is it just me, or is Kazuma's tongue getting sharper by the minute?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Don't worry, Mr Naruhodo. Your mind can only get sharper, too!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Mr Sholmes and Professor Mikotoba's visit to Judge Jigoku's cabin... ...yielded a minute piece of evidence that was very nearly overlooked, if my memory isn't failing me.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">You must bring it to mind, Mr Naruhodo! And in a timely fashion...before the bailiff burns everything!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge Jigoku! This was found in your cabin yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What is that? The crown of a pocket watch?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">A, a pocket watch...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And if you will observe, the victim's pocket watch, which we know he treasured... ...is missing precisely that part.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">It, it can't be...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Moreover, this crown is a perfect fit on the spindle protruding from the victim's watch.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Now, the fact that this was retrieved from Judge Jigoku's cabin... ...tells us that the victim's watch almost certainly broke there.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Grrr.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In other words, the victim was killed on the 31st during the twenty-minute evacuation drill... ...in the cabin occupied by you, Judge Jigoku!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">......... Well...you're razor sharp, aren't you, you young murderer...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Expertly manoeuvred, Ryunosuke.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">And your argument sounds entirely plausible... ...at first. But rather like this pocket watch, it's full of cracks.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">And I believe Judge Jigoku feels the same way.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I was wrong to acquit you earlier in the year.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">If I'd known that it would result in anyone having to listen to this drivel... ...I would have declared you guilty just to spare the world your ridiculous bombast.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I think it's clear... ...that the witness will have to give further testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">When you hear what actually happened in my cabin that night... ...you'll notice the pitfall into which you've stumbled.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Prior to your renewed testimony, I would like to clarify one point: The fact that this part of the victim's watch was discovered in your cabin... ...means that you acknowledge he was there, I presume?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Yes, I do.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Very well, then. You may proceed to give your formal testimony... ...about what exactly happened in your cabin aboard the ship on the evening of the 31st October.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">...Of course. As a man of the law, I have no intention of obstructing justice.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I had a guest waiting for me when I returned to my cabin after finishing my evening meal in the dining room.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">'Ippon seoi'...?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">A common jujutsu martial arts technique in my country. I was careful not to use too much force, but the man obviously landed too heavily for his watch to take.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So Ryunosuke Naruhodo... ...I imagine you can see the flaw in your logic now, can't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The fact that the pocket watch was broken in the witness's cabin... ...in no way proves that the victim's murder took place there!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I've no doubt the inspector intended to kill me. But he didn't manage to pull the trigger.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Yes, because he was merely the tactician. Not the Reaper's hand of death.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Well, the testimony appears to make perfect sense as far as I can tell.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Let me express my deep gratitude for your understanding, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>But if this testimony holds... ...Judge Jigoku will be deemed to have had no involvement in the case!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Well, Counsel? I really see no reason for wasting precious court time here on a cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry, My Lord. The defence has a right to cross-examine. And I don't intend to squander that.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">You're an embarrassment to your countrymen... not knowing when you're beaten.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">In that case...proceed, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I had a guest waiting for me when I returned to my cabin after finishing my evening meal in the dining room.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Because the so-called guard posted at your cabin door had just let your killer pass, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Apparently Gregson told the crewman he was a police inspector. ...Which was the truth, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>He wouldn't have had his identification with him, though...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">He had his trench coat and moustache, not to mention the bag of chips. I imagine the crewman was convinced.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But the man accompanying him would have had two sword [sic] slung around his waist.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You mean me?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Who else?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Yes, that's true. You would have hoped the sight of a few swords might have set off alarm bells in the guard's head.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...The point is, I left the cabin before its occupant returned and I immediately disembarked the ship.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Certainly, all I can tell you is that only the inspector was waiting for me when I arrived back at my cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And you entered without any inkling of suspicion?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">That's right. None whatsoever.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">When I walked through the door, a mustachioed Englishman was there, foolishly waving a gun at me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Obviously you're talking about Inspector Gregson?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Yes, though at the time, I didn't know the man's name. And there was no time for introductions. I value my life over manners.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">By which you mean...that the inspector was there to assassinate you, I suppose?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">That was certainly the impression given by the gun pointing in my direction. But I've never seen the muzzle of a revolver shake about so much in all my life! Anyone would think the man had never shot somebody before.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Believe it or not, most of us haven't...</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Anyway, there was no time to call for the help of the crewman at the door. So I dealt with the man myself.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I soon took care of him with an ippon seoi throw, though. He couldn't wait to run away after that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Even though the man had a gun?! That was a very brave move, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Hah hah hah hah hah hah! My ippon seoi is far faster than a bullet, I can assure you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But surely all that commotion caused the crewman to come in, didn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Hm? Yes, of course. He burst in immediately without knocking. The inspector hurled himself at the stocky fellow, and just managed to slip past him to make his escape.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...The outstanding guard does it again.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Luckily there aren't many situations I can't get out of using a quick ippon seoi throw!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I imagine his watch was broken when I threw him over my shoulder. It has nothing to do with his murder.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The crown snapped off and the glass covering the face of the watch was cracked...</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Preferable to the man's head being pulled off or his spine cracking, wouldn't you say?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Not that the man was spared for long. A bullet to the chest soon saw to that. But the point is, the broken pocket watch doesn't prove that a murder took place.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Absolutely not! All the watch proves is the power of my jujutsu throw!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Whatever you say, it doesn't quite ring true that no shot was fired in that cabin. Because there was an obvious bullet hole in the wall.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Hah hah hah hah hah hah! What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">That's what the star of your lowbrow detective stories told you, is it? Well, I don't care for such fiction.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Haven't you worked it out yet, you little stripling? No murder took place in my cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">The inspector was clearly killed having returned to Britain. Because his body was found in London.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But there's no evidence that proves the victim ever returned to London alive!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">...Just take a moment to think that idea of yours through now, stripling.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">If the inspector was killed on the steamship in France... ...how on earth could he have got back to Britain?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">When people die, their bodies remain at that same spot. ...It's a devil of a thing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...then...obviously the culprit must have moved the body!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">How exactly? Carrying a corpse off a ship in your arms would raise a few eyebrows at least, don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...yes...that's true, but...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">All passenger luggage is inspected when it is unloaded from arriving vessels. And I would like to think the border police would query the corpse of an English gentleman as hand luggage.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">If the murder had taken place aboard the ship, you would imagine the body would have been disposed of at sea. There would be no sense in risking being caught by attempting to transport the body back to Britain.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... <thought>That's killed that idea then...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">But...perhaps not!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We've heard that the first-class passengers were under constant scrutiny by the crewmen posted to guard them. Which would mean that the culprit had no opportunity to dispose of the body in the sea.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...that's true! So transporting the body to Britain may have been the only viable alternative.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Dear me, you really are new to this, aren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I thought I'd been perfectly clear, but it seems I'm going to have to explain it in words you can understand. I think I ought to alter my testimony...with your consent of course, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I have no objection. State your amended testimony now.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">There's no possible way I could have transported the victim's corpse back to Britain.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hmmm...there's an idea...</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Think about it, stripling. All passengers and crew disembarked at the same time and passed through the same checks at the border. The symposium guests were then driven straight to the hotel in carriages organised by the ministry.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And we met you as soon as you arrived at the hotel.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">So you did! Well then, remind me: did I have a corpse over my shoulder at the time?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...?! No!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">So we're in agreement then. I couldn't possibly have brought the inspector's body back to Britain. Unless of course they've developed some clever device these days to instantly move things from A to B!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Funny you should say that...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Professor Harebrayne's invention didn't actually work, if you remember, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...of course.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The defence has become unusually quiet, I notice.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Yes. Because there's really nothing more to say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So that's his story...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, I suppose if you think about it... ...whenever you drop a teacup in the office and it breaks... ...we don't say, 'Mr Naruhodo must have been murdered there!' ...Do we?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Is that a veiled threat about what might happen to me if I break another one?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And the fact is that Inspector Gregson's body was found in the little room on Fresno Street. If he really was killed in Judge Jigoku's cabin...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...The body would have to have been moved somehow, obviously. <thought>Transporting a dead body over a country border... That would be impossible for the majority of people. So there must have been some special circumstances that made it possible for the culprit, then...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">That could be a vital realisation, I think, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's no possible way you could have moved Inspector Gregson's body, you say? I would say the opposite is true.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">And what's that supposed to mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Far from being impossible for you to do... ...the transporting of Inspector Gregson's body back to Britain is something ONLY you could do!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What are you talking about, Ryunosuke?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As well as being a judge, Mr Jigoku is also Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs. Which means he's exempt from having his luggage searched when he enters the country.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We learnt that when we first met you upon your arrival in London.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">...!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Well, all those passport checks and luggage searches at the border took rather a lot of time. I must say, I'm very envious of your ministerial status. You didn't have to go through any of that, did you?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Ah, I knew you were jealous! Hah hah hah hah hah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I presume you recall this, Judge Jigoku? It's a photograph we took in the foyer of the hotel to mark the occasion. As the court will note, you have with you your large travel trunk. Large enough, in fact, to have a corpse inside!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">M-Mr Naruhodo! Surely you're not suggesting...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm afraid I am, yes. Three days ago, when we were chatting innocently with the new arrivals from Japan in the hotel... ...the body of Inspector Gregson was just metres away from us, inside Judge Jigoku's trunk!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Order! Order! Order in court! I'm sceptical, Counsel, that a grown man's body could fit inside even the largest travel trunk.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It could. Because I happen to know that the witness himself, a man of considerable size, fits inside his trunk. And verifying that would be extremely simple... wouldn't it, Judge Jigoku?!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But, but inside his trunk... How horrifying!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And after we'd spoken with you at the Great Waterloo Hotel... ...you had the opportunity to visit the apparent 'scene' on Fresno Street... ...taking your trunk with you in a cab, to deposit the inspector's body!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I don't have to listen to this nonsense!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Dr Gorey, the coroner who examined the body, has confirmed the possibility. She's acknowledged there are signs that steps may have been taken to disguise the true time of death. The onset of the body's decomposition could have been delayed by storing it in a refrigerator.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Counsel, as I remember explaining yesterday... ...refrigerators of the requisite size are few and far between.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I'm sure they are. But one place they're certainly found is on large ocean liners.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Such ships are equipped with electrically refrigerated cold rooms to keep food fresh on their long sea voyages. And the SS Grouse is no exception. Professor Mikotoba told me about it only yesterday. ...Well, Judge Jigoku?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">However much you prolong this debate, you can't eliminate the truth. All the evidence...points to you being the killer!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">......... Ha ha ha ha ha ha hah... Well, this is all very heartening.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I can see that it was a wise move letting Asogi and you embark on this study tour.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What are you talking about now?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Logical reasoning, of course. All court proceedings will be built on logical reasoning in the new century. And I can see that you've both laid firm foundations for that already!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Judge Jigoku, please! Stop diverting attention from the issue at hand! The defence has made an accusation against you. How do you respond?!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Respond? There's really no need for me to respond, is there?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Why ever not?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Because before you can even begin to answer the question of when the victim was killed... ...you must first establish one key fact: Where was the victim killed? ...It's quite logical.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The actual scene of the crime...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The prosecution's stance is unaltered. The killing took place on Fresno Street when the gunshot was heard... ...as the accused, Barok van Zieks, shot the victim at point-blank range!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Since no tangible evidence exists to disprove the prosecution's claim at this time... ...the defence's deductions amount to little more than an elaborate fairy tale.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I'm afraid that's how the logical reasoning the British are known for really works, young stripling.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... The victim was shot in that little room on Fresno Street and died instantly? I'm afraid it's the prosecution's claim...that's the only fairy tale here.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">How can you say that?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Quite simply... Because that claim directly contradicts a certain piece of evidence in our possession.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Very tantalising, Counsel. I think you had better explain yourself to the court, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The prosecution claims that Inspector Gregson died instantly when he was shot at the scene on Fresno Street. But this evidence clearly contradicts that claim!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Stronghart:</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Perhaps my Japanese friend's inexplicable thinking is why people talk of the mystique of the East?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not the only Japanese around here. ...Do you even have a mirror?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The court is not interested in the mystique of anything. You will be penalised accordingly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Was the victim killed in the room on Fresno Street, or was he moved there after his death...? There's one piece of evidence we have that shows the answer to that question surprisingly clearly!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Perhaps you should try to present the correct one this time then, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Are you going to try again? Or can't you hold your hand steady enough to point it out?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">A photograph of the victim in the very location you claim he wasn't killed?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! But the point is the posture of the body itself.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If Inspector Gregson had been shot there in that room... ...it's out of the question that his body would have been curled up in a ball like that!</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I'm sorry to disappoint you, but your logic is flawed. He could easily have adopted that foetal position due to the pain of the shot which subsequently proved fatal.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sorry to disappoint you, Judge Jigoku, but it's your logic that is flawed.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">According to this autopsy report, the victim died instantly. He would have felt no pain, much less have been able to draw himself into that position.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Which begs the question of why the victim's body is curled up in that way. Though the answer should be abundantly clear by now.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You're, you're suggesting...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The inspector's body took on that posture ahead of its arrival on Fresno Street... ...before it was coldly turned out on the floor...from the inside of a large travel trunk!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">No!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Y-You're quite right... The shape of the body... It looks exactly as if it had been kept in a confined space!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge Jigoku, present your trunk for examination! I believe it's very possible that it will contain traces of the victim's blood!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">AAARGH! ......... Present my trunk? I refuse!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">On what grounds?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">......... I'm the Minister of Foreign Affairs from the Empire of Japan! I shouldn't have to put up with this treatment just because of some stripling's baseless accusations!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">In other words, Judge Jigoku... ...there is blood in your trunk!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I decline to answer that. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I have privileges that allow me to-</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">At this moment, you're not a government minister. You are a witness in a trial in Britain's highest court!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I don't care who you are or what your status outside this courtroom might be, you will NOT withhold information! Nothing is more important than the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Ugh... UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Order! Order in court! Well, Mr Jigoku...what's it to be?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You can't be serious! You did it?!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">......... Have you no shame at all...Kazuma Asogi?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">......... Very well, I admit it. I did bring the inspector's body into the country. Inside my trunk...exactly as postulated by the defence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...?!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Dear God! Outrageous!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So it WAS you! You admit to Inspector Gregson's mur-</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">No! I admit to nothing more than what I've said.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Of killing the man, I certainly have no recollection.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What on earth is that cryptic statement supposed to mean?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I merely disposed of the inspector's body, which was left in my cabin. In order to avoid unwanted attention. As the judicial assistant over there pointed out, I had no chance to throw it into the ocean. So...I decided my only option was to bring it into Britain with me and dispose of it somewhere else.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You, you can't still deny it! If you didn't do it, then who on earth did kill the man?!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">As you know, there was one other person in my cabin that night. He had the opportunity. And moreover, he'd already accepted a mission to take the inspector's life.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">That's right! Who else could it have been?! It was you...Kazuma Asogi!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........You... I never thought you'd stoop to this, Seishiro Jigoku.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">You've taken the words straight out of my mouth... 'Prosecutor' Kazuma Asogi. You thought by leaving the body in my cabin you could pin the crime on me, did you?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Well...the prosecution counsel has already admitted to visiting the witness's cabin on the night in question.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Yes, on an assassination mission, no less.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You, you wouldn't...</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">So...what do you make of that, young stripling? You've heard my testimony now. And that's all I have to say on the matter. I'll admit to nothing more!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I, I don't believe this...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Counsel for the Defence... ...what is your position now? The court awaits your response to the witness's assertion. The assertion that on the night in question, the victim's assailant was in fact Mr Kazuma Asogi.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This isn't the dead end it seems to be. The answer's right in front of me. It comes down to Jigoku...Or Kazuma. Both of them had the opportunity to kill Gregson, but only one of them did it. And I'm just a step away from proving who!</thought> Very well. The defence is ready to respond to the assertion put forward by Judge Jigoku. The idea that the victim's murder could have been committed by Prosecutor Asogi is...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Well, it is possible, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Wha...?! How could you?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you think I want to believe it?! But the fact is... ...I can't say with complete certainty what actually happened because I wasn't there!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You... You disappoint me, Ryunosuke!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If I may, Mr Naruhodo... ...I think perhaps that's why we form opinions based on evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! <thought>So true... And actually, we have evidence that can settle this argument conclusively!</thought> My Lord! The defence would like to present evidence in support of-</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Before you plough on, feigning ignorance of what just occurred, Counsel... ...you must be penalised for that short but embarrassing 'Ah!' you uttered a moment ago.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Uuugh... I really thought I could just brush past it if I was quick enough...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Never mind the penalty, Mr Naruhodo! The truth is all that matters!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge Jigoku! Let me remind you of something you said only a few minutes ago. You claimed that logical reasoning is the future of the judicial process.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">It is. No question.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, logical reasoning can prove something here. Namely, that it would have been impossible for Prosecutor Asogi to commit the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The court will only accept an argument that is supported by compelling evidence. So present what you have, Counsel. What proof is there that allegedly demonstrates the impossibility of Prosecutor Asogi's involvement?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Every piece of evidence has a role to play in arriving at the truth. They're not playthings you can toss around the courtroom for entertainment!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAGH!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Never mind the evidence, you're about to make me weep, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Oh no! I can't upset Susato-san...or I'll end up being upset, too! We know a member of the crew was on sentry duty outside the first-class cabins nearly all the time. So as long as the guard was there, it would have been impossible to fire a shot without it being heard. And that very much narrows down when the crime could have been committed...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This itinerary for crew members of the SS Grouse, My Lord. This is conclusive proof!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">An itinerary? How does that prove anything?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge Jigoku! The moment you acknowledged that you found the victim's body in your cabin... ...this itinerary suddenly became much more significant!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">What? ...Why?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">On the night in question, as always, a crewman sentry was on guard outside your cabin door. As long as he was there, nobody could have fired a shot inside the cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Absolutely. Because it's inconceivable that the guard wouldn't have heard it and come to investigate.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So that tells us that the crime must have taken place when the guard was elsewhere. And that narrows it down to the twenty minutes just after ten o'clock, as indicated on the itinerary.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Yes, I see no flaw in your reasoning so far.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But the crucial point is this: when the evacuation drill took place... ...the steamship had already put to sea from the port of Dunkirk.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Now, clearly the murder could only have been committed by somebody who was aboard the vessel at the time. But Prosecutor Asogi stated in yesterday's proceedings...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I didn't come to Great Britain to take anyone's life. So I left Gregson and disembarked the ship. I spent that night at a boarding house in the town, and returned to England the following morning.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Which I'm sure the court will agree is conclusive proof... ...that Kazuma Asogi couldn't possibly have carried out the killing!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">GYAAAAAAAAAGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">No! Absolutely not! I don't accept that at all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">The boy's just saying that to exonerate himself! We can't trust that he really disembarked the vessel! Obviously after he left my cabin, he hid himself somewhere nearby on the ship. Just waiting! Waiting for his chance to come back and finish the-</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, that's out of the question. Isn't it, Kazuma?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...As the defence rightly recalls... ...I disembarked the vessel and spent the night in a boarding house in Dunkirk. And as I said yesterday, I signed my name in the accommodation's register book. All extremely easy to verify...and undeniable proof!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Agh! No! I...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's no escape this time! You can forget that you're a judge or a government minister. It's time you gave the court an honest answer, as a common man.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Grrrrrrrrr...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You killed Inspector Tobias Gregson and transported his corpse back to Britain. Then you dumped the body in the room on Fresno Street and made it look as if the murder had happened there. That's what really happened, isn't it...Seishiro Jigoku?!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">It was that damned trial ten years ago... That's when all this began. Looking back now, my fate was decided that day. I was doomed already. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">The assassin exchange request arrived from Britain about one year ago. ...Though it was hardly a request. It was a demand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And for that, you decided to recruit Mr Asogi. But things didn't go according to plan. Your chosen assassin never made it to Britain. And you found yourself unable to dispatch a replacement... ...because I was already on my way to Britain at that time in Kazuma's place.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">And that left me with only one option for carrying out my obligation: To eliminate the mark myself. Personally. Of course, there was but a single opportunity for me to do that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The International Forensic Science Symposium, I presume?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">That's right. I decided it would be safest to carry out the plan before my arrival in Britain. So I enlisted the help of my British counterpart... ...and made arrangements for a pretext that would take the inspector to Dunkirk. To lure the man in, he was given a sham mission by the Reaper.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">W-What?! <thought>The Reaper...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But there's only one person who could have done that! The mastermind of the entire operation: the Reaper himself!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So...that means that the assassin exchange was... It was all planned by the Reaper!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">......... I'm not at liberty to say anything about my British counterpart. Anyway, the inspector accepted the Reaper's mission and dutifully infiltrated my cabin on the steamship. But it was all a trap designed to lead him to France... and his own death.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, how awful...</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">It was past nine o'clock when I returned to my cabin from the dining hall that evening. I didn't give him time to attack me. I choked him until he lost consciousness. But there was a guard just outside the door, so I left it at that for the time being. Even the slightest noise might have aroused suspicion, so I bided my time, waiting...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">For the twenty minutes after ten o'clock...</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I had intended to finish him by strangulation. But moments before I had the chance... ...he suddenly came round and went for me in a reckless move.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I'd received the British-issue gun sixteen years earlier, being a member of the judiciary as a visiting student. ...I never imagined I'd have to use it for something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">So the revolver belongs to you, does it?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then the victim was killed inside your cabin on the SS Grouse. Which begs the question... ...of why you arranged for his body to be discovered in the room on Fresno Street.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">...The young judicial assistant over there has already answered that question. There was no way I could take the body up on deck to throw it over the side. That's precisely where all the crewmen were gathered for the evacuation drill. So before the first-class cabin sentries returned, I took the corpse to the refrigeration room.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And then on arriving in Dover, you concealed the body in your trunk in order to smuggle it past the border police.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I knew I needed to take steps if the police were to be convinced when the body was found in London.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">In that case...you must have known. You must have had intimate details of Inspector Gregson's intended schedule.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Yes. My British counterpart sent me everything I needed to know. The inspector was due at Fresno Street at five o'clock that afternoon. In order to meet a man by the name of Hugh Boone, from whom he would take back his police identification.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I decided that man would be the perfect person to set up as the culprit. So I took a hackney carriage over there with the body still in my trunk.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That must have been just after we took this photograph with you at the hotel, then...</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Yes, I wasn't expecting a welcome committee. I was more than a little nervous. On Fresno Street, I spotted a young girl selling little firecrackers.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Miss Venus of course...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I conceived of the candle trick there and then. So I donned a simple disguise and approached the girl to buy enough firecrackers to replicate a gunshot.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What sort of disguise?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">For some reason, the inspector had a bright red hairpiece in his own travelling case. So I put that on. Although I suspect I drew more attention to myself in that than I would have otherwise.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The hairpiece we found at the scene. The inspector had it ready for the Red-Headed League investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I only arrived at the room at around quarter to five. So I quickly placed the body on the floor, moved the noticeboard and set up my little candle trick. I arranged it so the firecrackers would go off with a bang around fifteen minutes later.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">So that Mr Boone, who was due to arrive at five, would walk straight into a trap?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Except...at the last moment, I made a careless blunder.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What was that?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I imagine...it was the bag of fish and chips.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">I didn't notice that it had fallen out of his overcoat pocket when I moved the body to the refrigeration room. I put it back into his pocket the following morning, but... Well, it seems the warmth of the heated cabin had accelerated the decay of the fish. ......... Anyway, that's... That's everything. All the sordid details of what I did.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I've heard enough. We've arrived at the truth about the murder of one of the country's most capable and respected police inspectors. The witness will be tried in the coming days. For a crime of such a vile nature...you can expect the most severe penalty.</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">An exchange of assassins... What a foolhardy idea...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Jigoku! One last detail! Who was your counterpart in Britain? Who was the mastermind behind the assassin exchange?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Nothing you say now can make matters any worse for you! Just tell us!</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">Eeeeeenough! I've already told you...that I cannot say!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Even though as things stand, you may very well never set foot in your homeland again?</line>
<line speaker="Jigoku">......... What are you waiting for? Can't we get this over with now?! It's finished...all of it! ...I'm finished...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Then, in the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I now pronounce the findings of this court. This man before us has admitted to the wilful murder of Tobias Gregson. Seishiro Jigoku, it is the opinion of this court that you should be found...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And may I remind all those present of the strict confidentiality demanded by this closed court!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Moments ago, Mr Jigoku signed a written confession... ...admitting to the murder of Inspector Gregson, and the subsequent conveyance of the body. In short, the defendant's innocence has therefore been established beyond doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, wonderful! Well done, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, um...thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Is something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I'm...just a little troubled... ...by his silence.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The true identity of the Reaper of the Bailey... And this extraordinary 'assassin exchange'... We do remain in the dark about these mysteries. However... ...insofar as the indictment brought against the defendant in this trial, we have reached a conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I have every intention of pursuing both mysteries... ...as a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...As you wish. Now, for the formal adjudication... I hereby declare the defendant, Barok van Zieks.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The prosecution calls for adjudication to be deferred.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Counsel...?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The accused's innocence hasn't been fully established at all. And therefore, it would be wrong to deliver a verdict at this time. That is the prosecution's unwavering position!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">W-What?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But...Judge Jigoku has already confessed!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Nevertheless... ...Barok van Zieks has committed crimes for which he must be punished.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Well... ...it would appear you have information that the court needs to hear, Prosecutor Asogi.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Certainly, the murder of Inspector Gregson was actually carried out by Seishiro Jigoku. But it's clear from the witness's testimony that he was coerced into complying with the plot. Into this sick, merciless assassin exchange!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That, that may be true, but...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So what I want to know is, who coerced Jigoku? Who was pulling the strings?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The victim went to France having been ordered on a mission for the Reaper...only to be murdered. In other words, the mastermind behind the assassin exchange is someone in a position to give such an order. As we've already established...the Reaper himself.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Well, certainly, that would appear to follow...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The prosecution hereby formally accuses the man in the dock, Barok van Zieks... ...of being the Reaper of the Bailey! And furthermore... ...I'm going to prove his guilt beyond all reasonable doubt!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Order! Order! Order! The Reaper of the Bailey...is a long-standing mystery, Counsel. Are you suggesting you have some new information with which to build a case?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Scotland Yard has already investigated Lord van Zieks very thoroughly in that regard. And they found no evidence whatsoever to substantiate the claim that he is the Reaper.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Perhaps. But circumstances have now changed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">It's already been established that the assassin exchange was negotiated with Jigoku by the Reaper himself. Which means we now have a new line of questioning by which to identify definitively the man's identity. That is the prosecution's intention here.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I must say I'm surprised... ...by quite how tenaciously you appear to want to besmirch my name.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">......... You are guilty of an unforgivable crime, Lord van Zieks. And I will bring you to justice for it...whatever it takes!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That explains Kazuma's silence before. He'll stop at nothing to finish what Lord van Zieks unwittingly started ten years ago...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Very well. Whilst it's extremely irregular... ...I will on this occasion grant the prosecution further opportunity for witness testimony. The defendant will disclose any and all involvement he has had with the Reaper and the assassin exchange!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I thank you, My Lord, for guiding the court so wisely.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I hereby declare this court to be in session for a supplementary hearing!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Pray turn a blind eye to the discourtesy as I verify that this vile and unremitting accusation... ...hasn't soured the contents of my hallowed chalice.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Lord van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I first had to suffer the pseudonym of the Reaper ten years ago now. And ever since that time, I've endured the weight of implied guilt that's gone with it. So I welcome the chance to testify now...and crush those allegations once and for all.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Good. Then let justice decide...Lord van Zieks. The prosecution seeks to begin building its case by calling the accused to the stand as the primary witness... ...in order that he may answer the accusation brought by the prosecution that he IS the Reaper of the Bailey!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And what says the defence?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Putting the defendant in the witness stand can be extremely dangerous. And Kazuma-sama is so emotional at the moment. He's not thinking logically!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're right that he's not himself. But I knew it would be like this. And I came here today determined to face him through whatever might arise. As a lawyer...and as his friend.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Then that's what we must do!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence has no objection, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Very well. Defendant, you will take the witness stand... ...and give formal testimony on the subject of your involvement with the Reaper...and the assassin exchange!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As you wish...My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I've never taken the life of another. Nor have I instructed another to kill.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">So you deny all accusations by the prosecution? Both that you are the Reaper of the Bailey, and that you masterminded the assassin exchange.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I acknowledge that the public at large believe me to be the Reaper. However, that's a fallacy, which I alone am in a position to foreswear.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Naturally, the prosecution believes the testimony just given by the accused to be untrue. Ryunosuke Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Let me ask you: why are you here? What really brings you to this courtroom?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... A desire to uncover the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Even if the truth proves your client to be guilty?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... From all my experiences in this courtroom, I've come to realise something: The truth can't be hidden. Sooner or later, it will come out.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So it's always my intention to work with my client in pursuit of the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">......... I want you to remember what you just said.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Enough dilatory chatter. Counsel for the Defence, proceed to cross-examine the witness.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...Yes, My Lord! <thought>I know exactly what you're thinking, Kazuma. I know you're just waiting to point it out. The contradiction you're convinced lies somewhere within this man's testimony...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I've never taken the life of another. Nor have I instructed another to kill.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you're not what the general public refer to as the infamous Reaper of the Bailey?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Don't imagine for a moment that the court will be satisfied with a one-word answer on this.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I realise that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>If you're intending to comment on every sentence, this could take a while, Kazuma...</thought> Didn't you find it...disturbing, though? That one by one, defendants who'd been acquitted after your unsuccessful prosecution were killed?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Let me answer that question by posing another: If, one by one, defendants who'd been acquitted after your successful defence were killed... ...would you find that 'disturbing'?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Disturbing?! I couldn't possibly say how that would make me feel with a one-word answer like that!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Well...that told me...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But even though I'm not the Reaper, that doesn't mean I ignored all the hearsay.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I've been investigating the truth behind the Reaper for years. And I was aware of Gregson's involvement.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You say 'for years'... How long exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Since the very first time the Reaper's influence was felt in this courtroom...ten years ago now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And your investigations led you somehow to Inspector Gregson, you're saying?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...I didn't want to believe it. He was a personal acquaintance. We'd worked on cases together in the past.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>A friend...even?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It felt like a betrayal, but...I demanded permission to search his office at the Yard without his knowledge.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Which is when you found his secret notebook, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It's when I first learnt of the location he'd noted only as 'Grouse' and the appointment at 5 p.m. on the 31st. Though I didn't know the significance of those details at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So now we're at the nub of the matter...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As it turns out, the significance for me personally was very unfortunate.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">That's the reason why I went to Fresno Street that day, and how I came to discover the body.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But why did you go to that specific location?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I thought that if it was the Reaper's headquarters... ...then by turning up there at five o'clock, I would catch whoever was involved red-handed. Sadly, all that was awaiting me... ...was the inspector's corpse.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... Even though it wasn't designed for you, you walked straight into the trap set by Jigoku.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Exactly. Jigoku had intended to implicate Hugh Boone. But unhappily for me, I arrived at the scene first.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Hah! A ridiculously careless blunder!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Moved on to just throwing insults around, I see then, Kazuma...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Think what you will. It doesn't change the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The point is, no common thread exists between myself, Gregson and Dr Wilson.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There is a link between you and Gregson, though.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Of course. We were close acquaintances. We'd worked on numerous cases together. I considered the man to be a mentor of sorts. He taught me a number of important lessons.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">H-He did? Such as what?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Where to buy good fish and chips...and suchlike.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Well...that was convincing.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Dr Wilson was a coroner, of course, but that was some time in the past. And in any case, I understand it was several years ago now that he was invited to work at a Japanese university.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. He was a visiting professor at the Imperial Yumei University in Tokyo.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It should be unambiguously clear then, that no link exists between myself and him. In other words, I had no motive for sending some assassin across the oceans to kill the man.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>It sounds plausible enough, and I want to believe it. But something about this just doesn't quite sit right with me...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Clearly, therefore, there's no reason to suspect me of being behind the assassin exchange.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Certainly as it stands, there's no evidence to suggest that you concocted the scheme.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But as it stands, we have only the accused's insistence of his innocence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Perhaps there is some reason that would explain why he masterminded the assassin exchange. And if a reason could be established later in these proceedings... ...then the accused's claim in this testimony that he wasn't involved would amount to perjury.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...yes...that's true, but...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Clearly Kazuma-sama... ...intends to identify a reason and use it to make his case.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So if we don't identify something first...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...He'll gain the advantage!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This could be dangerous...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>A convincing testimony by Lord van Zieks...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Certainly, with no apparent connection between the three men, there's no way to establish a motive. The testimony seems unassailable as far as I can see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear me! What a bleak expression!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I agree, there doesn't appear to be any particular link between them...at first glance. But with the inclusion of one other person... ......... <thought>I must be over-thinking it, surely...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Another person, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I need to think back over all the information we've gleaned so far.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Alright. And I'll review my notes about the case and all the evidence in the Court Record!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Could it be...that Lord van Zieks has something to hide after all...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What is this? An autopsy report? Wait...this is ten years old...from the autopsy of Lord Klint van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?! My brother's autopsy report?!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I'm pleased to see the defence doesn't intend to run from the undeniable truth.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Order in court! What reason do you have for presenting a ten-year-old autopsy report here, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This...the autopsy report of the Professor's final victim... ...is an indelible link between Inspector Gregson, Dr Wilson...and the defendant!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Not that accursed name again! The Professor...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I've personally researched all of the court records relating to that case. I know that at the time, autopsy was considered sacrilege to the victim's souls. And for a member of the aristocracy like Lord Klint van Zieks, it was unthinkable. But someone implored the powers that be to allow the autopsy to go ahead: Inspector Gregson. He declared that he was certain he would obtain conclusive proof from the procedure.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And it was Dr Wilson who conducted the autopsy. His signature is clearly visible on the document!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As promised by Gregson, the autopsy did indeed produce evidence. Evidence that conclusively proved Genshin Asogi was guilty of the murders. In my brother's dying moments, he mustered all his remaining strength to leave that vital clue behind.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Indeed. That was the key to indicting the Professor for his crimes and the conclusive evidence that convicted him. It enabled Lord van Zieks here to avenge his brother's senseless death...with a marvellous victory in court.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">A marvellous victory, was it? I wonder if that's really true.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Could the same be said if it turned out that the key piece of evidence in question was in fact fabricated? If the inspector, the coroner and the prosecutor all colluded together... ...to cast an innocent Japanese man as a mass murderer and send him to his death!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">That's outrageous!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">And now, ten years later, for some reason the secret has been threatened and needs protecting. Which is why the inspector and the coroner had to be silenced...isn't it? By someone in power in Japan and in Britain...using the two killers recruited for the assassin exchange!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Order! Order at once!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Ten years ago, my father was convicted in this very courtroom as a mass murderer...to be sentenced to death. But it was all a sham! And I swore to myself that I'd prove it. Which is why I HAD to come to Britain... whatever the cost!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You'll have to forgive me if I feel compelled to toast this vengeful Nipponese's tenacity of purpose here. However... ...he who fails to quash his emotions in the courtroom... has failed as a lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Come on, Kazuma! You know this won't wash! You're claiming your father was misrepresented in a trial that took place a whole decade ago! You must see that without evidence, that's nothing more than a wild accusation!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">As it happens...I have evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">WHAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">As the court has heard, I crossed the Channel to France with Gregson on the 31st. I went with him on the pretext of being the assassin recruited to kill Seishiro Jigoku. But my true intentions...were to make the inspector tell me the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What truth?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The truth about the evidence. And he acknowledged what I'd already deduced: There's a closely guarded secret about what went on in that autopsy ten years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What? A secret? ...I know nothing of any secret!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">While we waited for my supposed 'mark' in Jigoku's cabin... ...I drew my clan's illustrious sword, Karuma, before the inspector's eyes. He very quickly understood what my true motive was.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Right, I see... You're that Asogi's young lad, are you? And what? You're gonna cut me down with that thing, is that it?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">That will very much depend on the answers you give to my questions. I want to know what really happened ten years ago. The truth. That's all.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... Before we get into it, let me make one thing clear: I still believe your father was the Professor. There's no doubt in my mind. But unfortunately back then...we didn't have the evidence we needed to make the crime stick.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So...you admit it then? The evidence used in my father's trial was fabricated?!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... It was for the good o' the country. Anyway...I was just followin' orders.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Orders? What exactly did you do? ...Speak!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'm not sayin' another word.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Even if your life depends on it?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">That's right. Even then.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So that's when the tip of the sword broke...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, Kazuma-sama...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">If the results of Klint van Zieks's autopsy were fabricated... ...then the investigating officer, Gregson, and the lead coroner, Wilson, must have known about it. And they can only have been ordered to pervert the course of justice in that way by one man: The man leading the case for the prosecution, Barok van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">In other words, the defendant DID have cause to organise this exchange of assassins!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Exactly. And as was established earlier... ...it has to have been the Reaper himself who liaised with Jigoku in Japan to arrange the exchange.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So it follows that the Reaper's true identity... ...can only be that of the man who stands accused in this courtroom today, Barok van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...What?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What you've just told the court... Are you absolutely certain of your facts? Did Gregson really fabricate evidence for that trial ten years ago?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I heard it with my own ears. His shameful admission.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... In that case...I know... ...the name of the Reaper.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Wha...What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I gave no such orders. I know that for certain. Which narrows down the remaining possibilities...to one!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>If Lord van Zieks isn't the one behind all this... ...then yes, there is only one other person who could have done something like that.</thought> I believe I know who it is, too.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You...?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I just had a feeling this name was going to come up...</thought> The true identity of the infamous Reaper of the Bailey is...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What's the matter, Counsel? I take exception at the look you're giving me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I was...just gathering my thoughts. I'm ready to voice the defence's opinion now.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Very well. But before you do...a penalty for time-wasting.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Uuugh...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Ryunosuke...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Counsel for the Defence, reveal your belief about the identity of the Reaper... ...if you have the courage and resolve to utter the name, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The only person who could have arranged the assassin exchange and manipulated the autopsy results... ...is the Lord Chief Justice himself... ...Lord Mael Stronghart!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Wha...?! Lord...Stronghart...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it's true that ten years ago, the defendant handled the prosecution of the Professor in court. But he only took over the case after his brother, Lord Klint van Zieks, had been killed.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... I can only assume that this is the most inappropriate joke in British judicial history.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Well, Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Ten years ago...I was very new to my profession. But I had a burning desire to avenge my brother's death, so I pleaded for control of the case.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The investigation to that point... The supplication of the Lords to allow my brother's corpse to be examined... All the evidence I was given... The autopsy reports... It all came...from you.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I've spent my life since then believing I was in your debt for the way you stood aside and let me handle the trial. But I see now... ...I was very much mistaken.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was a hugely influential force that caused the inspector and the coroner to break the law ten years ago. And that same force was still felt a decade later on the other side of the world...by Seishiro Jigoku. Lord Stronghart! Everything falls into place when we recognise that you... are the Reaper of the Bailey!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The court awaits your response...My Lord. This may very well go down in British judicial history, but I assure you...it is no joke. Consider this a formal accusal by the defence!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... It doesn't warrant a response.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">A formal accusal? Don't be absurd. The defence's claims are utter nonsense. A wild fantasy at best.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You're not going to defend yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You claim there was some wrongdoing with Lord Klint van Zieks's autopsy? That's utterly untrue.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But I heard it from Gregson's own lips! He admitted to it!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...And where is your evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Gregson's dead now. Unless you were thinking of summoning a ghost to the stand?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You, you mean to say...?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I forget how the system works in your little backwater country... ...but in the courts of the British Empire, without evidence, there is no case. I have no intention of entertaining some wild fantasy that can't possibly be substantiated by anyone or anything!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">AAAAAAAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Order! Order in court! Following Inspector Gregson's murder and in the light of Dr Wilson's death as well... ...there's really no one left who could testify about the events of ten years ago...is there?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So that was the real purpose of the assassin exchange...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">This court has no business raking over the coals of a case that was concluded a decade ago. The accusal brought by the prosecution and the defence is categorically denied. I take it there are no objections?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Kazuma... He's more or less waited his whole life for this moment. Is there really nothing else we can do now? Is there no other avenue we can go down in pursuit of the truth about what happened all those years ago...? If only there was someone who could testify about Klint van Zieks's autopsy</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>He's gone to extraordinary lengths to cover his tracks. Even so far as dispatching an assassin all the way to Japan to ensure Dr Wilson's silence. And Dr Sithe won't say anything against Stronghart...</thought> .........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Ryunosuke, please!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I'm sorry, Kazuma...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo... ...isn't there someone rather important whom you've overlooked?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Your silence is beautifully eloquent. I take it we've reached the end of this debate, then. Let the matter be closed...for good!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>He's gone to extraordinary lengths to cover his tracks. Even so far as dispatching an assassin all the way to Japan to ensure Dr Wilson's silence. And Dr Sithe won't say anything against Stronghart... But...there's still one ray of hope!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Actually, there is one person... One person...who could still testify about that autopsy!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Don't be ridiculous. There's no one left!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Who, Ryunosuke, who? Tell me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma, I...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Please! This trial can't end! Not yet!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The person the defence would like to call to the stand to testify about the autopsy of Lord Klint van Zieks is...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Stronghart:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! I want to know why!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... And I want to know why you're proposing to call such a witness with that look of utter desperation on your face.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">In other words, you're wide of the mark, Ryunosuke. Very wide.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Thanks. Don't spare my feelings or anything...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Given the contemptible allegations you're making, Counsel, I won't be letting that blunder pass unpunished.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Uuugh...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There was somebody else present at the autopsy, Mr Naruhodo. Surely you haven't forgotten?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, I...I know. I'll get it right this time!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Heaven help us. Another Japanese?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An expert in forensic medicine, My Lord. Professor Yujin Mikotoba. Sixteen years ago... ...he came to London with Seishiro Jigoku and Genshin Asogi as a visiting student.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And what could his testimony possibly tell us?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Professor Mikotoba was the primary assistant during the autopsy in question. He was also the person who actually penned the report!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Incorrect. The autopsy was carried out by the coroner, Dr Wilson. The report carries his signature.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It was the primary assistant's duty to keep a written record of the coroner's work during the procedure. In actual fact, the coroner merely read over the report at the end and signed it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In other words, Professor Mikotoba witnessed the entire autopsy from start to finish. The defence demands that Professor Mikotoba be summoned as a witness as a matter of urgency! Whatever really happened in that autopsy laboratory ten years ago...is something only he can tell us!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The defence's demand is denied.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But Professor Mikotoba is in London at this very moment! We could summon him to the stand in minutes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>No, of course he's not going to agree to it. Stronghart has no intention of summoning anyone who knows. He's too concerned about protecting himself!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Prosecutor Asogi, let me refresh your memory, as you seem to have forgotten the prosecution's stance: Only minutes ago, you accused the defendant of being the Reaper and of masterminding the assassin exchange.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I, I did, yes...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">So present your evidence for those claims and make your case complete!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I...I... At this time, I don't have the requisite evidence. But that's exactly why we need witness testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The Professor case is closed. There are no clues in the distant past that will bolster your argument today. I'm afraid to say, Prosecutor Asogi... ...that you would appear to be possessed by the spirit of your late homicidal father.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Now, as I stated earlier, this court has already reached a conclusion with respect to the matter at hand. Inspector Gregson was murdered by Japanese Supreme Court Judge Seishiro Jigoku. As for any hidden circumstances that may exist, they will be investigated in due course by the proper authorities.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But we all know what will happen! That'll just give the mastermind of the whole venture time to cover his tracks again!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">By which you mean me?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Your punishment for this contemptible behaviour will be decided at a later date. As for you, Prosecutor Asogi... ...you will be remanded following these proceedings. Willingly, I trust...since you gave your word.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Argh!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">This futile game of revenge is over...young Master Asogi.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Grrr... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">That will be all! I hereby declare this trial to be over. Court is-</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">M...Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">This is no place for amateur detection, Mr Sholmes. May I remind you that these proceedings are closed to the general public. You will leave the courtroom at once!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes was instrumental in the apprehension of Seishiro Jigoku before he fled from Europe. The court should hear what he has to say!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Lord Mael Stronghart... ...it's imperative that you refrain from bringing this trial to an end at this stage.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Is it really? And why would that be?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You need only recall your own words from the opening of the trial to answer that question. If I may... 'We will stop at nothing to uncover the whole truth behind these disturbing findings!' Surely it can't be... ...that the shock of being accused of being the Reaper yourself has erased that from your memory...can it?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The whole truth, sir, has already been uncovered!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... It would seem that we have a great many important members of the judiciary present here today. I put it to you, my dear fellows...should the trial end at this juncture? After all, why have you been invited to attend? To nod along to the prevarications of your superiors?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Order! Order in court!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It seems to me that we stand before a door that leads to a new era of legal practices. A door that is ajar. Let us emerge from the shadows of the Reaper's decade-long ascendancy. For you and you alone, my dear fellows, have the power to push this door open now!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The auditors in the gallery have no rights to express an opinion on court proceedings! Silence!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What... What's...?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">A toast...to my dependable colleagues in the gallery!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, My Lord? You hear the voice of British justice, I take it? I think you'll find it will be rather awkward to silence.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I have no intention of shrinking from these allegations.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Bailiff! Arrange for the subpoena of the witness at once! As soon as the gentleman arrives at the courthouse, we shall reconvene.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">A recess won't be necessary, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Mikotoba is a close friend of mine. He accompanied me today and is waiting in the antechamber as we speak. I do believe he's been enjoying a little trip down memory lane, in fact.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What?! Professor Mikotoba is here in the courthouse?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes, you... You didn't know this would happen, did you?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My dear fellow, no one is in a better position to answer that question than you, surely.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I wasn't just asking for the fun of it, you know.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Well, I must thank you for your assistance in this matter... Mr Sholmes. However... ...you are of no further use here. Kindly leave the courtroom at once.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But of course. In truth, I find myself rather busy now as a result of these developments. Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! ...Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I trust you have Iris's little lucky charm with you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Absolutely! It's still in my pocket.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">She sends her regards, and a reminder: If you find yourself at a dead end, the ears are at your disposal. ...Just one tug, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, um...of course!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">In that case, the trial will continue without delay. Bailiff! Show the witness to the stand!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So it's Lord Stronghart... He's the Reaper of the Bailey. Where exactly is this trial going to take me, I wonder? Just how deep am I about to be plunged into the blackness of the abyss? Well...I'm ready. I'm ready to head into the heart of this maelstrom and confront whatever horrors it tries to drown me under!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So, witness...please state your name and occupation for the court.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Yujin Mikotoba, lecturer in forensic medicine at the Imperial Yumei University in Tokyo, Japan.</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">And...Professor Mikotoba, the young lady beside you is...?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Ah, this is Dr Maria Gorey. Scotland Yard's practising coroner. The daughter of Dr Sithe, I understand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes, Dr Sithe...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I'm afraid I can't tell you why she's here. She just...appeared.</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">......... You summon this strange Japanese man as a witness to that autopsy... ...but you don't summon Mama. That makes no sense. She was there too.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">...That's about the size of it. I've had her eyes boring into the side of my cheek constantly. Whilst I was in the antechamber, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Poor man. The idea of it's making ME shudder...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The revelations about Dr Sithe that came to light some days ago defiled the reputation of the entire judiciary. She was therefore deemed unfit to appear as a witness in today's proceedings. The Ministry of Justice's decision on that is final.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Well, we wouldn't want any more perjury to be committed, would we?</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>The Ministry of Justice? Some questionable strings are being pulled, I think...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I remember you...Dr Mikotoba. But I certainly never expected to be meeting you under these circumstances.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Yes, it's been a long while, Lord Stronghart.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The prosecution understands that you were a visiting student of forensic science in London until ten years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">That's right. I studied under Dr Wilson at St Synner's.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So you were present at the autopsy of my brother, Lord Klint van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I was, yes. I assisted Dr Wilson with the entire procedure.</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">...Tsk. Mama is far more skilled than any Japanese man.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Well, Dr Wilson asked me to be his primary assistant on that occasion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And this autopsy report was actually penned by you, I believe?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Yes. I noted all of the doctor's findings and when we were done, he read through the document and signed it.</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">Poor Mama... As secondary assistant, she wouldn't have had such a good view of all the innards.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So, Professor...do you remember Inspector Gregson?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Yes, of course. If it wasn't for his insistence, Lord van Zieks's autopsy would never have happened. But he was absolutely convinced that it would reveal decisive evidence against Genshin, you see. So Lord Stronghart had to entreat the nobility to allow it to take place. Do correct me if I'm wrong, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...It was a result of that autopsy that a mass murderer was apprehended and justice was done.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But Gregson admitted it before he was killed! He admitted that the results of the autopsy were fabricated!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You were there at the time. So you must testify! You have an obligation to tell the truth about what really went on!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Absolutely. That's precisely why I'm here.</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">And that's why I'm here, too!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Very well, then. You will give your formal testimony now, witness. But before you begin, a word of warning:</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">...Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You will state truthfully and accurately what you saw and what you heard at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">...I wouldn't dream of doing otherwise, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The moment your testimony verges on supposition, I will expel you from my courtroom. Remember that.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">.........</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">From my own observations, I couldn't say there was any indication of the autopsy results having been fabricated.</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">There were no other signs of internal injury. Nothing questionable at all.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Presumed to have been swallowed by the victim as a way of posthumously identifying his assailant.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">No indication...? NOTHING to suggest fabrication?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Professor Mikotoba! Are you certain about that?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Well, nothing that I could positively identify as such, much less swear to in testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Heh heh heh... Hah hah hah hah hah hah haaah! Well, that clears things up nicely! The only fabrication here, Asogi...has come from you.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You claim the inspector confessed just before his death. But that...THAT is the fabrication!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">No! He freely acknowledged it! I swear he did!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Freely? With the tip of a sword at his throat? The man was clearly at his wits' end.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The court will give no credence to this 'confession' that was uttered in obvious desperation. Quite simply, there was nothing questionable about the investigation of Lord Klint van Zieks's death. And with this testimony we have, without question, uncovered the whole truth of the matter!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">If I may, My Lord... ...there was most certainly something questionable about it. And the whole truth does rather elude us, I feel.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I beg your pardon.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Well, you're obviously aware of the facts of the case. All four of the Professor's previous victims... ...died when an enormous beast was set upon them that ripped out their throats.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, such horrifying crimes...</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">But curiously, the killer's last victim, Lord Klint van Zieks, suffered a different fate.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, you're right...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He was stabbed through the heart with a sword...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">That's enough.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I believe I warned you about this, witness. I promised to curtail your testimony as soon as it entered the realms of supposition or speculation.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Hmph.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Very well, My Lord. In that case the defence will pursue a conclusion to this during the cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I have the right to cross-examine every witness after testimony. And I fully intend to exercise that right!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Ryunosuke...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm afraid that even the presiding judge... ...has no authority to contravene the letter of the law. As I'm sure every member of the judiciary present in the gallery would agree!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Hmph! Very well. You may begin, Counsel. However, the moment your argument strays from the established facts... ...I will not hesitate to bring the cross-examination to an end. Proceed with caution.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">From my own observations, I couldn't say there was any indication of the autopsy results having been fabricated.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You, you couldn't say?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">No, sadly not.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But then you couldn't say there wasn't any indication, either...could you?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">......... No, true, I couldn't. I was at Dr Wilson's side as he performed the procedure, recording what he did. But at times of course, he instructed me to fetch implements and suchlike. Whilst I was away from the operating table, obviously I could have missed something.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And at those times, what was the secondary assistant doing?</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">...Following this Japanese man's orders to adjust the lighting or pass him implements. But that doesn't mean Mama wasn't a vital part of the team!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Q-Quite, yes. So would you kindly refrain from starting at my cheek like that?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Professor Mikotoba, think! Was there nothing at all that seemed out of place to you?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Well...yes, there was, as a matter of fact.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Death resulted from a wound made by a Western-style sword transfixing the heart. That I found a little strange.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In all of the previous four killings attributed to the Professor... ...the victims were killed by an enormous dog, I believe? Their throats were, well...mauled?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Correct. And yet Lord van Zieks was stabbed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Do, do you mean to say... ...you think Lord Klint van Zieks may not in fact have been one of the Professor's victims?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">There is no basis on which to doubt the findings of the investigations carried out at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Genshin Asogi confessed to all of his crimes upon his arrest. He admitted to having taken the lives of all five members of the aristocracy.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Argh!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Yet the beast that was used to carry out the killings was never identified. No evidence was found to suggest that Genshin had ever kept a dog.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...A true hound of hell.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">There were no other signs of internal injury. Nothing questionable at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, um...you weren't actually present at the autopsy yourself, were you, Dr Gorey?</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">Does that matter?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, I...just wonder how useful your testimony can be in that case, really. I mean, it would be different if your mother, Dr Sithe, were in the stand, but...</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">I've read all the paperwork about the case! And Mama's told me the story countless times! The statement I just made is exactly what's written in the autopsy report!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I did confirm that myself at the time, it's true. Besides the stab wound, there were no other signs of internal trauma.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">......... Mama told me all about it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">She said there was nothing of note internally... ...but they did find an amazing piece of evidence. Something unbelievable!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Unbelievable? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Come on, Dr Gorey! What was it?</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gorey">It was just that beautiful but dangerous piece of evidence removed from the man's stomach.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What exactly was it, though? What does 'beautiful but dangerous' mean?</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">Well... ...it was sparkly and round, with a hole...as if it might slip over a finger perhaps.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">It was a ring. Belonging to Genshin Asogi.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">M-My father's ring...was inside the victim's stomach?!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">At the time, Genshin wore a large ring on the digitus quartus of his left hand - the fourth or 'ring' finger. I'd understood it was some sort of keepsake.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">When my father left Japan for London sixteen years ago, I was eight years old. But I remember that ring.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You do?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">My father's possessions were sent to our family home in Japan after his death, but the ring wasn't among them.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Obviously not. It was a key piece of evidence. It remains under lock and key in the stores at Scotland Yard to this day.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">After the autopsy, Genshin was summoned by the police to check for the presence of his ring. It wasn't on his hand of course. Moreover...there were deep abrasions on his finger where it had been pulled off.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">...They arrested the man there and then, right before my eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">How could they?!</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">I brought the ring along with me today.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">Here it is. A bit dusty from years in the stores.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Good gracious! Yes, that's it. I haven't seen that in ten long years...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">And...that was found inside the victim's stomach?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">......... I... Yes, I'm afraid so.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You hesitated there, Professor Mikotoba. ...Should we read something into that?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Ah, well... It's just that thinking back now... ...I didn't actually witness the moment it was extracted from the victim's body.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! Really?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">At that precise moment, Dr Wilson had asked me to fetch him a new scalpel, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Dr Gorey... ...the removal of historic evidence from the stores requires my consent, does it not?</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">However it came to be here, the court cannot deny that this is crucial evidence for today's proceedings.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Very well, you may submit it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's not the sort of ring normally seen in Japan. <thought>They almost look like claws protecting that jewel...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">We must examine it very carefully, Mr Naruhodo. Very carefully indeed!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">By beautiful and dangerous evidence, you mean this large ring, obviously.</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">That's right. Pulled from the victim's stomach once it had been sliced open nicely.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It was my brother's final move before he perished. An ingenious one, to leave us a clue by which to identify his killer.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">He must have ripped the ring from Genshin's finger with his teeth... ...before swallowing it to keep it from being retrieved. ...That was the prevailing hypothesis at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">W-With his teeth?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">On his arrest, Genshin Asogi's ring finger on his left hand was found to be badly wounded. ...Evidence of my brother's final struggle against the man.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">All for this ring...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">These fat claws are doing a good job of protecting the equally fat gemstone in the middle of this ring. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, if you were clumsy, you could give yourself a rather nasty cut on them, I should think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ow! Now my finger's bleeding! The claws really are sharp.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! That was very quick clumsiness, Mr Naruhodo, even for you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Uuugh... Who would make such a dangerous ring?! <thought>You couldn't swallow it without doing yourself some fairly serious damage, surely...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">A sticky mochi bun of about that size would go down much better. With some red bean paste in the middle!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Someone as clumsy as me would probably manage to choke on it somehow.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Presumed to have been swallowed by the victim as a way of posthumously identifying his assailant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And that was the decisive piece of evidence that led to Genshin Asogi's arrest?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Correct.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">After further investigations by Scotland Yard, the man admitted to his crimes.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">That's a lie! My father was no killer! Barok van Zieks! It was you! You twisted the truth to suit your purposes!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Your hatred of me doesn't change the facts that were established ten years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My brother Klint had closed in on the Professor. In the end, he exposed the man and put a stop to his lethal rampage. ...In the way only a man of my brother's calibre could.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That's everything...is it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Poor Father. He looks so troubled.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Perhaps because ten years ago...something happened that's been weighing on his mind.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'I couldn't say' were his words. That phrasing was very deliberate, I'm sure!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wonder if he's had his suspicions all these years.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If that's the case, we need to use this cross-examination to prove what really happened... ...and remove any trace of doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If we could establish that Kazuma-sama's claim of fabricated evidence was true...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We can't shy away from this now. Even if what we might uncover could lead to total calamity.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Don't worry, Mr Naruhodo. I'll be right beside you, whatever may happen!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The court has heard that the ring was extracted from the victim's stomach. But you didn't actually see it being removed, did you, Professor Mikotoba?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">That's right. As I said in my testimony before... ...at that moment, I was fetching a replacement scalpel that Dr Wilson had requested.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In other words, you can neither confirm nor deny... ...whether this ring in fact really came from the victim's stomach or not.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What are you suggesting, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That the ring was never in the victim's stomach to begin with! It's entirely feasible that Dr Wilson fabricated that detail about the autopsy!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What are you saying?! That Dr Wilson...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That Dr Wilson was in possession of the ring in advance, after it was somehow stolen from Mr Asogi... ...and he produced it during the procedure, pretending to have found it there and then in the victim's stomach.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This evidence...right here.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">That's the autopsy report!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">It's explicit in that report, Counsel. Other than the ring, nothing unusual was noted internally. So I'm not sure how you intend to prove your point.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You've already done it for me, My Lord. The lack of internal injury says it all.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">To swallow a ring of this size would require considerable effort and determination. And in addition to its size, there are the sharp claws around the gemstone to contend with.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My brother was a determined man. And on the brink of death, even more so, I'm sure. He would have stopped at nothing to ensure that evil killer was brought to justice.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But if he really had swallowed that enormous ring... ...it's inconceivable that no traces of its passage down his throat would have remained as internal trauma!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">No!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">......... And there you've arrived at the sticking point. That's precisely why I had my doubts about the findings myself ten years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Then why didn't you say something at the time?!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I did. I still remember the conversation I had with Dr Wilson in the laboratory that day.</line>
<line speaker="Wilson">Look at this! Now this is a very curious thing to find in a man's stomach, wouldn't you say?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">But...isn't that rather peculiar, Dr Wilson?</line>
<line speaker="Wilson">What's that now, Mikotoba?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Well, if he swallowed a ring of that size, with those sharp metal claws that it has... ...surely you'd expect to see damage to the throat and oesophagus? Torn mucous membranes at the very least.</line>
<line speaker="Wilson">.......... Doctor Mikotoba, may I remind you... ...that I have vastly more experience than you.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I'm, I'm terribly sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Wilson">I can think of plenty of ways to explain why no injuries would be seen. No, let's say this: 'The victim would appear to have ingested the item as evidence to identify his assailant.' Go ahead! Write it down!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So I was right! Dr Wilson deliberately fabricated the results of the autopsy to implicate my father!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I'm disappointed, Counsel. That argument is nothing more than speculation.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Dr Wilson was Britain's leading authority on forensic science and autopsy work. There is no scientific basis on which to doubt the man's expert opinion.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Pardon the interruption, My Lord, but... ...damage to the mucous membranes of the throat is easily identified even in living subjects.</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">Using a device called an 'endoscope', recently demonstrated in practical use in France. I want one! ...The government can pay.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I don't think so! And Dr Gorey... ...rest assured that your removal of evidence from the stores without permission will not go unpunished.</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">......... We open up the dead to find the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">But Mama... She chose to stitch her corpses up...with all her secrets inside... ......... That's wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Dr Gorey... <thought>It's looking as though... ...she's chosen to walk a different path to her 'mama'.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Yes...the ring.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What about the ring?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I've just remembered something. An earlier incident.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What incident?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The one I recounted to you before. About a memory I have... ...of Genshin Asogi saving my life.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What?! My, my father...saved YOUR life?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It was ten years ago, on a foggy night. Genshin and I were walking down some back streets at a late hour. All of a sudden...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">All of our assailants were armed with pistols, their faces obscured by scarves.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The next thing I knew, there was silence all around. Genshin lay on the cobbled street. Blood was seeping from his left hand. He'd shielded me.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It was on the ring finger of his left hand that he used to wear that ring.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Are, are you saying...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I've always believed those thugs were after me. But now I'm starting to question if perhaps I wasn't the intended target after all...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">W-Wait, but...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Genshin was arrested two days after that attack. And in that short interval, the decisive evidence needed to indict him was miraculously found.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You mean...the ring was stolen from him?! You think that's what those thugs were after that night?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">......... You... You pathetic coward... You expect me to believe that you weren't involved?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">It was you, wasn't it? You're the one who took it. You stole my father's ring! You set the whole thing up so you could paint him as a mass murderer and have him arrest-</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma... ...open your eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">R-Ryunosuke?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You must know deep down... The truth can be completely obscured even when your judgement is only slightly clouded. But at the moment...you seem to be floundering through a dense fog.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is that why you were so insistent I should be present in this trial? To see you like this?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Heh heh heh... Well, this is an amusing spectacle. What a grandiose expression on your face! As if you were Lady Justice herself.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">It seems that you've thoroughly convinced yourself of this alleged fabrication of the autopsy results. So much so that you're apparently blind to the blatant contradiction that would be born out of it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Though it's extremely hard to believe, let us imagine that there was some misconduct during the autopsy. If that were the case...why would Asogi not have disputed the findings in his trial?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">In the closed court hearing ten years ago, the defendant never once denied the claims against him. ...Isn't that right, Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Yes, that is indeed correct. Upon hearing the verdict of 'guilty', he merely closed his eyes, quietly accepting the judgement. The actions of a man who has accepted responsibility for his deeds and is resigned to his fate.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but then...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my... That is very strange. If Mr Asogi did nothing to oppose the charges against him, then... ...that would surely mean there was no fabricated evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">An obvious conclusion at which you should have arrived many minutes ago...Prosecutor Asogi. Your twisted loyalty and clouded judgement are hampering your ability for logical thought.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Argh!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Genshin Asogi's silence at his hearing can mean only one thing: There was no fabrication of evidence during the autopsy of his final victim ten years ago!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! <thought>But if that autopsy was all above board... ...there'll be nothing to stop Lord Stronghart bringing this trial to an immediate conclusion!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Thank you, Ryunosuke. If it wasn't for your frank words just now... ...this trial may very well have ended prematurely.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">K-Kazuma...?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What's this latest absurdity, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">My Lord... ...your reasoning is perfectly sound...but for one, giant hole!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You claim my father's silence was due to the fact that there was no fabricated evidence. But there's another possible explanation. You've overlooked the possibility that he had a reason for maintaining that silence!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Oh, those results were an invention alright. There's no question of that. Or are you forgetting that two people with a connection to that autopsy have been assassinated?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">If I force the grievances I feel from my mind...I start to see you in a very different light. I think perhaps it's you who's been living in delusion these ten years.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">M...Me...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Kazuma-sama has created one last chance for us here, Mr Naruhodo. If we can only show there was a reason for his father's silence in his trial...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>A reason why the man would have said nothing even though he was innocent... Could it have been part of some negotiation, perhaps?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Enough rhetoric! The court must be shown evidence. What proof do you have that could possibly explain Asogi's silence in court?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">As I indicated before, my patience for rhetoric is growing thin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>You could've at least accompanied that penalty with an explanation of why that answer was wrong...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">If Kazuma-sama's father knew that the evidence being used to convict him was fabricated... ...why would he have said nothing in his trial?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If it were me, I'd have protested my innocence until I was blue in the face.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So if we're right about the autopsy results, there must have been a strong reason for his silence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well then...perhaps... ...he was saying nothing in exchange for some sort of clemency? Ah! <thought>That could be it!</thought> My Lord! The defence would like to-</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's true that Genshin Asogi's silence during his trial resulted in his conviction... ...but that didn't actually lead to his execution. On the contrary... ...it led to his escape. An escape that was only possible because he'd been sentenced to death.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Although I find it hard to believe my father would have negotiated in that way...the defence is correct. A fake execution, falsification of a death certificate and a jailbreak inside a coffin... Clearly such an elaborate plan couldn't have been carried out by my father alone.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">He must have had the help of a collaborator from the judiciary.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I have here the dismissal notice of the chief warder who was working in the prison at the time. The notes read: 'There are indications that the jailbreak was in planning prior to the inmate's incarceration.' In other words... ...there were suggestions of some sort of negotiation between Mr Asogi and the British government!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">In exchange for his silence in court, he was given an assurance that he would be broken out of prison... Yes, with that sort of clandestine agreement in place, I can imagine he would have kept very quiet.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I would go further than that, in fact. I would say... ...that the elaborate jailbreak of Mr Asogi can be explained in no other way!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Order! Order! First fabricated evidence and now a jailbreak conspiracy?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of course. Because it's all intimately linked.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The prosecution wishes to summon new witnesses to the stand!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Witnesses?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">People who can testify about the jailbreak that took place ten years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Governor Caidin...? And the poor chief warder of the prison!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I won't allow this trial to turn into a farce! To summon the governor of the prison after all these years...</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Oh, it wouldn't be any trouble, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Father...?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">My dear friend may appear a little rattlepated at times, but I can assure you he is extremely thorough. He wired both Barclay and the local prison earlier... ...asking Governor Caidin and Mr Vigil to attend the Old Bailey as a matter of extreme urgency.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes did that?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Are, are you telling me that...?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Both men are, unless I'm much mistaken... ...waiting just outside the courtroom at this very moment.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">My Lord, you must permit this trial to proceed as you declared at its outset. You promised that we would stop at nothing to uncover the whole truth behind these disturbing findings!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Very well. Bring in the witnesses! Make no mistake: I, too, would like nothing more than to lay this business to rest once and for all!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Would the new witnesses state their names and occupations for the court, please.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Aye. Barry Caidin, governor of Barclay Prison.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Everyone calls me Gossip. I sell jaunty little titbits to passers-by, you-</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, your other persona, if you don't mind...</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Oh, I do beg your pardon. Of course...</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">My name is Daley Vigil. I used to be the chief warder at Barclay Prison.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The reason you've been summoned here to court today... ...is to testify about the jailbreak of the so-called 'Professor' ten years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Losh! The Professor?! We've already been through all this afore. A decade ago! And the conclusion was that there was'nae anythin' untoward happened.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A convict escaped from your prison, Governor. Hardly what you'd call 'nothing untoward'!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Ah...well...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The convict's death certificate was somehow falsified after he was allegedly executed... ...and he escaped the prison inside his own coffin. A plan of that complexity... ...could never have been carried out without the help of somebody of influence inside the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Governor Caidin, don't imagine that the passage of time will afford you any protection.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">If it turns out that you were involved in the plot to break Mr Asogi out of your prison, then of course... ...the consequences will be very serious. In all likelihood, a capital punishment.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Gads! Hold on there, laddie! All I did was-</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Witness! ...Governor Caidin...</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Hm? Ah, aye, SIR!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You have a critical role to play in the public safety of our country. A great responsibility to shoulder. The significance of your testimony in court cannot be understated. Therefore...think carefully before you speak. And Prosecutor Asogi...if you threaten the witness again, you will be held in contempt of court.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...! My apologies, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's no disputing the fact that an intricate jailbreak plot was enacted ten years ago. Clearly, you were both involved in some way. So you will testify before the court now and explain exactly what took place!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Very well. Let the witnesses give their formal testimony. Tell the court everything you know of the plot to break Asogi out of Barclay ten years ago!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">It was the day that Japanese jock was found guilty. The directive came from the Prosecutor's Office.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">I was responsible for Asogi right up until the night of his execution. But I knew nothing of any plot...</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">I dinnae ken if there were some negotiations between the convict and the Prosecutor's Office.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A directive from the Prosecutor's Office? Are you saying that was the jailbreak plot?!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">...Aye, that's right.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Who sent it?! Who authorised that plan?!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">......... I dinnae ken that.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You're saying you don't know?!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Listen, there was'nae a thing aboot that Professor case that was'nae unusual in some way. I did'nae ask any questions. I just did what I was told to do. More than that, I could'nae tell ya.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But if the jailbreak plan originated from the Prosecutor's Office... ...then one thing is very clear: As suspected, there were clandestine dealings going on between Mr Asogi and that office. The jailbreak was promised in exchange for Mr Asogi admitting to crimes he didn't commit!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">That, Counsel, is nothing more than speculation on your part. So...let me ask the defence...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Yes, My Lord?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I fail to see how these witnesses have any more pertinent information here. Do you intend to assert your right to a cross-examination?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Absolutely! I have no intention of squandering a single opportunity, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...It seems all you Japanese are fiercely tenacious. Very well. Proceed, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">It was the day that Japanese jock was found guilty. The directive came from the Prosecutor's Office.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And you say you don't know who actually issued the directive?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Aye, that's right. All I can be sure of, is that it was official.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But if it was from the Prosecutor's Office, that narrows down who could have issued it straight away.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And it wasn't me.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">I cannae even say wi' certainty that it did originate from the Prosecutor's Office.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">There's no tellin' where it started. There's a fair chance it came from higher up the ladder. Basically... ...I cannae give you any indication of who was behind it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You can't be serious...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">All we can say for sure is that the order must have come from somebody in authority, I suppose.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">The likes of us on the ground, as it were, dinnae bother wi' idle speculation. We just get the job done.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">I assigned the convict to the chief warder Vigil here, and put the plan into action behind the scenes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So Mr Vigil, you didn't know anything about it at all?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">That's right. My only role in the scheme...was as a scapegoat. That's right, isn't it...Governor?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">......... Some poor beggar had to take the rap for it.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Alright then, who else did know about the plan?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">I've no the first idea, laddie. My part in the whole business was basically just dealin' wi' the aftermath. But I would'nae be surprised if there were other folk in the prison service who'd been given similar orders.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you don't know who else was involved...</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Aye, that's right. All I can tell ya... ...is that the night it actually happened, the person at the reins...was Dr Stevens.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Dr Courtney Stevens? <thought>Or Dr Sithe, as she's known now...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Haaah... Why did I have to get caught up in such a terrible business...?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">I was responsible for Asogi right up until the night of his execution. But I knew nothing of any plot...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did you not notice anything unusual happening in the lead up to that night?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Oh, everything was unusual. Exception after exception. After all, it was the Professor. The man had terrorised the country as never before with his crimes. In order to hide his identity, he was forced to wear an iron mask over his head.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...Hideous treatment.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">The fella was surprisingly docile for someone who'd taken the lives o' five o' the country's nobles.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Being the chief warder, I was the only person permitted to approach his cell. I can still hardly believe that I was duped by my own country.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I believe you jumped from the window of the governor's office when the jailbreak was blamed on you, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">......... Losh, Vigil... I cannae apologise enough.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">No, Governor, I don't believe you can. It won't change what's happened.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">And what else can you tell us about the situation, Governor Caidin?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Haaah...</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">I dinnae ken if there were some negotiations between the convict and the Prosecutor's Office.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But you've already acknowledged that orders came from the Prosecutor's Office to arrange for the man's escape! There must have been some sort of negotiation! It's the only explanation!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Aye, well, be that as it may. I dinnae ken nothin' aboot that. The witness stand is no place for tellin' what ya don't know for sure. I ken that much, I do.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Then I presume you also know this: Not telling what you do know is a criminal offence.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So you were just following orders, is that it? I'm afraid that won't absolve you of guilt here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A man was still killed illegally, even if he was a condemned criminal. You may very well be found complicit in murder, Governor!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So that's what it's to be, is it? Even with the threat of conviction, you won't break your silence.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">.........</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">All I did was carry oot my duty! For Her Majesty's great British Empire!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did you carry out the plan in its entirety?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Aye, I did everythin' I could at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">As you know, Genshin Asogi was shot dead in Lowgate Cemetery after the escape. Tell me...was that part of the plan, too?!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">My instructions were to do wi' gettin' the jock oot of the jail an' nothin' more. I cannae tell you anythin' aboot what happened after that. Only... Personally, I believe his death was the last part of the plan.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Vigil! Is something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Uuugh...uuuwaaaaaagh! Yes, sir? What can I do for you, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>He's saluting now? What is it? Some sort of Barclay convention?</thought> What Governor Caidin was just saying seemed to upset you. Did it bring something to mind, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">......... For the last ten years, I've completely blotted out the memories of that time from my mind. I was betrayed by my superiors...in the name of my country.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Just as my father was betrayed, it seems.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">......... But you see...thinking back now... ...I really can't imagine that the shooting of Mr Asogi in the cemetery was ever part of the plan.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What makes you think that?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Well, it just doesn't make sense, does it? To make the man admit to crimes he didn't commit with the promise of a jailbreak, only to kill him in the end... That's treachery of the worst kind. But the point is, if the intention was always to betray him... ...why would there be any need for all the chicaneries of an escape?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! That's quite true!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If whoever negotiated with Asogi never intended to keep his or her end of the bargain... ...it would have been far simpler just to let the man be executed in prison as dictated by his sentence.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...It all happened in that vast chamber of secrets that is Barclay, behind the high prison walls. I suppose nobody knows what really went on in the execution room now... Yes, it's an unsettling mystery, certainly.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">......... Truth be told...there is a wee matter that's never quite made sense to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">If you believe there was some kind of negotiation behind the jailbreak, atween Asogi and a body at the top... ...it does'nae quite add up, does it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Governor Caidin, I must insist that you explain these doubts that you have... ...by amending your formal testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Gads! ...Aye, go on then.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">WHAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Aye, it were a rum do. No doubt aboot it. But ya have to mind, they were special circumstances. It was to protect the British justice system. That's just how the execution had to happen, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're saying that Mr Asogi's murder in Lowgate Cemetery WAS his capital punishment? You realise Mr Vigil tried to take his own life as a result!</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">.........</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Aye...well...that's another story.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Who was it?! Who shot my father in the cemetery that night?!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">...I've no answer to that question.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">However it happened, the convict's life was destined to end that night. The moment the execution order was signed, his fate was sealed. This court will not pursue the identity of the individual who carried out the order.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Grrr...</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">It seems to me that the Japanese fella did'nae have nothin' to bargain with.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Admitting to the crimes. That was what he had to bargain with, surely?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">I cannae see that myself. After all, did the prosecution no have conclusive evidence against the carlie, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">This, you mean? 'Discovered' during the final victim's autopsy. There's every possibility this 'conclusive' evidence was fabricated by Scotland Yard and the Prosecutor's Office!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Em...aye, that's right! So what I'm sayin' is... ...the convict had nothin'. Nothin' he could use for any kind of bargainin' at all.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The witness makes an astute point. Logically, it would seem no negotiation could have taken place.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>And yet the plan to break the man out of prison was definitely put into practice. So he must have been armed with something that gave him an angle to negotiate.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>So Asogi-san agreed to confess to the crimes because he was assured he'd be broken out of prison later...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I really don't think that Kazuma-sama's father would have engaged in such negotiations.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then perhaps something compelled him to agree?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What a terrible thing... Using the law to legitimise such underhand dealings with a desperate man... ...only to double-cross him in the end. It's quite the opposite of justice!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I can't help feeling... ...there's something about this apparent negotiation that doesn't quite add up.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Something doesn't quite add up, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, it doesn't. But I can't quite put my finger on what yet.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well in that case, we must keep digging until we identify the problem!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Confessing under oath to murders he didn't commit on a verbal assurance of later being broken out of prison... Genshin Asogi was taking an incredibly risky gamble.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Very true. There was nothing to stop the British breaking their word and executing him behind closed doors anyway. Under normal circumstances, no man would stake his life on a gentleman's agreement like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Which means that Mr Asogi must have had a trump card. Something that guaranteed he wouldn't be betrayed. Some kind of weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Havers! The fella could'nae possibly have had anythin' like that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But you know that he did, Governor. The Asogi Papers - the name given to the last will and testament of Genshin Asogi.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It turns out that Mr Asogi was hiding his will in his cell at Barclay. Chief Warder Vigil caught him with it one day.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">You...you squealed, did ya, ya wee rat! Did I no tell ya to keep that a secret?!</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">You, you can't touch me now!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">GAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When Mr Vigil caught sight of that will through the bars of the convict's cell... ...Mr Asogi pleaded with the warder:</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Alright then. But what's on that paper?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">A weapon...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And after the convict had been killed following the elaborate pretence of the jailbreak... ...that document mysteriously disappeared, didn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">W-Well yes...all the prison warders searched through the belongings in his cell, but... ...that will was just nowhere to be found.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As I understand it, an exhaustive search was made for the document - which became known as the Asogi Papers. Governor Caidin... ...I believe you ordered your prison staff to find it at all costs, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Eh?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Would I be right in saying that you knew? You knew that the so-called Asogi Papers had the potential to make great waves somehow!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Jings! What the blazes are ya bletherin' aboot?! The, the will was found, right an' proper... ...in the fella's cell where I said it would be!</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">But how can that be? Where in his cell? We all searched the place from top to bottom!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Well ya did'nae do a proper job, eh, ya peelie-wally galoot!</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">You, you can't criticise me now!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">I showed it to ya afore, did I no, yon lawyer?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, you did. I have the document here. It's written in Japanese, and reads: 'The Last Will and Testament of Genshin Asogi'.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Which means everything is as it should be.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Not quite, My Lord. You see, there's an undeniable inconsistency here.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What?! What inconsistency?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Asogi described this document as the only weapon he had left. And yet this will contains nothing of significance at all. Nothing that would have given the convict any leverage.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Are you suggesting, my learned friend... ...that the last will and testament stored at Barclay Prison all these years... ...is actually a fake?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... As has clearly been demonstrated already... ...what went on at Barclay Prison...was far from above board!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">That last vilification by the defence was an affront to the entire British legal system. This absurd notion of a 'weapon' is something for which we have only the former chief warder's word. The man could quite easily be lying. Or at the very least, sorely mistaken.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">What? No! I, I definitely heard him say that! I swear!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Clearly we need to get to the bottom of this. We need to know exactly what happened with these so-called Asogi Papers!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">A waste of time! ...If the will was fake, where is the real document?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Vigil was stabbed in the back by the judiciary ten years ago. He lost everything. Very nearly his own life.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">...!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And now you're going to do it again. You're ready to brand him a liar and turn your back on him without even letting him defend himself!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What did you say?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">It would seem that a vocal few here are utterly blind to the truth. ...Very well then! Let the witness testify again. Tell the court precisely what you think you saw of the convict's last will and testament!</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Y...Ye...Yes, sir, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">As the warder responsible for condemned convicts, I attended to Mr Asogi and kept watch over his cell.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">I only found oot about the Asogi Papers when a directive came tellin' me to impound them.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">In his kimono?! That's...that's a lie! We searched every inch of the man's cell. We looked through all his clothes! It can't be true!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Were you no satisfied wi' callin' me a liar the once, eh, ya wee waffinger?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Hah! There's nothing you can do about it now. You don't have any hold over me any more. Other than the hold you like to take on my cravat, of course. Is that what you're going to do, is it? Are you going to give me a good shake again? ...Or are you too scared?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Little and large... What a double act.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">We complied with Asogi's will as far as was possible. All of his personal effects were delivered to his family home in Japan. ...As a courtesy to the homeland of the most notorious killer our country has ever seen.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">......... And we were much obliged. I can confirm that all of my father's belongings arrived safely.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Aye, and you cannae deny the handwritin' is that of your old man, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...Yes, there's no mistaking that it's my father's brushwork.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really...?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And this last will and testament was the man's last 'weapon', was it? I think we can safely assume that the convict was merely prattling...knowing that his end was nigh.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">So, Counsel for the Defence... your cross-examination, please!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">As the warder responsible for condemned convicts, I attended to Mr Asogi and kept watch over his cell.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So would that mean that you conversed with Mr Asogi?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Yes, certainly. Though there was precious little time before his execution was due.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">He was remarkably calm, considering his days were very much numbered. In all honesty...he really didn't strike one as a man capable of mass murder.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Yet he confessed in full to the crimes.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">I know. That's why I felt compelled to ask him one day. I can still recall his reply: 'I'm guilty of the unforgivable crime of ending another human's life, yes.'</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">But he was so tranquil and intelligent. It put me in mind of an Eastern holy man.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And what about the will you saw him with? What can you tell us about that?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">......... It was the beginning of all the drama. I remember it very well. Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">The night after he was found guilty in court, he was doing something with that will in his cell!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And he pleaded with you not to report him, didn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Yes, that's right.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">And like the bampot y'are, ye did'nae tell me. ...A blatant breach of trust, that was.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">I could see that the man had a noble spirit. I...found myself wanting to treat him accordingly.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But according to what you told us two days ago... ...the convict had been strictly forbidden from having any writing materials whatsoever.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Yes, you're quite right.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! So when exactly was the will penned?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">That was before the man was remanded in Barclay, obviously.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Yes, at the Prosecutor's Office under supervision of the relevant authorities. I personally instructed Asogi to make a will for the benefit of his family in his homeland.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In that case...why was it found in his cell?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">W-What do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, if it was penned at the Prosecutor's Office... ...you would have expected that it would remain there for safekeeping, surely?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's curious... There doesn't seem to be any obvious explanation for why it was subsequently found in the convict's cell.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Och, well...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The defence makes an astute point. Well, Governor?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">......... A prison governor cannae be expected to ken the inner workings of the Prosecutor's Office.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">In that case...Lord Stronghart, perhaps you can shed some light on the matter?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... I'm unable to offer an explanation here and now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I would have to consult with the notary responsible for the will at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The fact that my father's will was discovered in his cell is clearly inconsistent with what was expected! ...I want to know why.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Another inexplicable mystery, then...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Well, um...the thing is about that will...</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">We turned the cell inside out looking for it after the execution, but to no avail.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was the governor who ordered the search for the will, as I understand it. Is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Yes. And when I reported back that we couldn't find it... ...he grabbed me by the cravat and yelled, 'It cannae have disappeared completely!' in my face.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Aye, well...it's doon to the governor to keep everybody workin' as hard as they should.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think the governor needs a 'wee' taste of his own medicine, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...The point is, it was clearly considered a very important document, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But it proved impossible to find...</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">That's right. Then before I knew it, it was in the morning paper. That blood-curdling article. The executed mass murderer who'd risen from the dead...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! You, you mean...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...The article based on Mr Drebber's experience in Lowgate Cemetery!</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">...Yes, that was it. The day after I'd read that news, I was summoned to the governor's office. And...that's when the awful accusation was made.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That you'd aided Genshin Asogi to escape from the prison, resulting in your immediate dismissal.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">I'm afraid I...I really don't remember anything after that.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">......... As the governor of the prison, I...I had no choice. I could'nae have done anythin' else.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">I only found oot about the Asogi Papers when a directive came tellin' me to impound them.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And that directive came from the same source as the one instructing you about the jailbreak?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Aye. From the top levels of the Prosecutor's Office.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What name was on it?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">I did'nae ken afore an' I dinnae ken now. All I can tell ya, is that my orders were to do everythin' in my power to find that document. The directive said it had to be somewhere inside the fella's cell.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Document'... Was that the wording? 'Document' not 'will'?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">...Aye, that's what it said.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Am I clutching at straws here...? I just wonder if it was really Genshin Asogi's last will and testament that the sender of that directive was after...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Continue with your testimony then, witness.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">The document was in the folds of the fella's robe that was left in his cell. A 'kimono', I think it's called.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In Mr Asogi's kimono?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Aye, the one he'd brought with him when he was locked up.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...he was permitted to have his personal effects with him during his incarceration, I understand?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">That's right. He was granted as much freedom as possible during the few days before his execution.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Indeed. He had a number of items of personal significance, I remember. He was very reluctant to part with them. Some books, that kimono, his sword...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">His sword?!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Karuma, the famous sword of the Asogi clan. ...It bears the soul of my family.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I don't doubt it, but I wasn't really getting at that... <thought>Forget it being the soul of the clan! Could the man have had a more obvious 'weapon'?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Have some respect, Ryunosuke.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Respectful silence?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">The warders carry firearms at all times, and the inmates have shackles around their ankles. He could'nae have hurt anybody wi' that thing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Still, he was allowed a sword, but no writing materials?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">...Aye. He wrote that will afore he came to stay wi' us at Barclay, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Dr Mikotoba was asked to bring the necessary Japanese writing implements to the Prosecutor's Office.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">A suzuri ink stone, black sumi ink and some hanshi rice paper, no doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">I was present when he wrote it... But I'm sorry to say the letters just looked like a squirmin' mass of jet-black earthwerums to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Are you feeling faint, Mr Vigil?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Vigil!</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Siiiiiir! It was scarlet, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... What?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Oh! I'm, I'm terribly sorry! I didn't mean to blurt it out like that. ......... ...............</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Less swaying and more explaining would be helpful...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Is it something about the testimony we just heard? Have you recalled something of importance?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Something of importance...? Possibly...or possibly...not...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I'm unable to tell which way he's leaning, I'm afraid.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord! The defence asks that Mr Vigil be permitted to supplement his testimony... ...with this possibly-or-possibly-not important detail!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Permission granted.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Go ahead, Mr Vigil.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Yes! It was scarlet!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">My father had a passion for calligraphy. He found the profound black colour of sumi ink to be very soothing.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm sure that cursive Japanese script must look utterly incomprehensible to English eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Anyhow, that's the document that was found in the fella's kimono.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Despite the seriousness of his crimes, he was treated in a gentlemanly fashion until the end.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">When he was callously betrayed and shot dead in a dark cemetery in the middle of the night. ...Yes, the gentlemanliness of it is overwhelming.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">As I remember it, the document was written in scarlet ink, but...perhaps I'm mistaken.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Scarlet, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Well...yes. I mean, I only caught sight of it for a brief moment, of course. But even by the dim light in the cell, I remember thinking that it was an unusual colour. At the very least, I'm quite sure it wasn't black.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Witness! Is that really what you saw?!</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Ah! Wha... Siiiiiir!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Um... Is something wrong, Lord Stronghart?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... I, I apologise. Continue.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What do you make of that, Mr Naruhodo? For Lord Stronghart to be so visibly shaken in that way...</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Och, dinnae haver! You can plainly see the writin' here. And it's as black as the Earl o' Hell's waistcoat!</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Well...yes, you're right...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Vigil, I'd like to confirm one point with you. Did you actually see the content of the document that Mr Asogi was holding that night?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Oh! Well, no! I mean, there was no time. As soon as he noticed me there, he hid it behind his back.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But it was definitely a will, was it?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Yes, it was. That's what Mr Asogi told me.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The court need waste no further time on this matter. We have the will in question in our possession. There is nothing more to add.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>A will written in scarlet ink... What did Mr Vigil really see Kazuma's father holding, I wonder...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">If you have an inkling, Mr Naruhodo, you must present it to the court at once!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>That testimony doesn't give much away.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">So this will really was penned by Kazuma-sama's father. I wonder what he could possibly have meant when he described it as a weapon...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's starting to sound very much like Mr Asogi actually had nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But the plan to break him out of jail went ahead. Which means he must have had some bargaining power. He must have been hiding something. It's the only explanation that makes sense.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's...starting to sound like Mr Asogi actually might have had something!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Which is it, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm not sure. But I feel as though I'm on the brink of understanding all this. Let's listen to all the information again and see what more we can learn. We can't overlook even the smallest detail!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Absolutely!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Scarlet-coloured writing is what you said you thought you saw, Mr Vigil. And I believe that's exactly what you did see.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Wha...?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Havers again! You've no evidence to say that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Have a look at this report.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">That's...my brother's autopsy report!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. And there's something in here that's bothered me since I first read it. It states that scarlet-coloured ink stains were noted on the fingers of the victim's right hand.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Yes, so it does.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">S-Scarlet ink...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Now, I'm not familiar with the habits of the British aristocracy, I freely admit. But I would hazard a guess that they don't all go around with ink stains on their fingertips, do they?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Your wit is not appreciated. My brother was a well-bred and fastidious man. Should ink have sullied his fingertips, he would have cleaned them immediately!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...What is your point, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My point is this! Whatever Lord Klint van Zieks was writing in that unusually coloured ink... ...it must have been directly before his death. Because he died before he had the opportunity to clean his hand.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... I remember something troubled me at the time. At the scene, the lid of my brother's inkwell was open.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But Klint was punctilious about such things. It seemed...unusual. And no document penned in the colour of the ink that was in the inkwell was ever found.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So the document had disappeared... Are you suggesting... ...that the document my father had in his hand that night in his cell was...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The same document that Lord Klint van Zieks was writing moments before his death.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Then...it was...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If Mr Vigil's testimony is to be believed, it can only mean that, yes. Mr Vigil!</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Siiiiiir!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When you spotted Mr Asogi with the document in his cell... ...his precise words were as follows, were they not?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Alright then. But what's on that paper?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">A, a last will and testament...</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Aaah...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If the conversation really did go as Mr Vigil says... ...then what we now know completely changes the meaning of what Mr Asogi said.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... You really think...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Vigil did indeed see the convict with a will. But it wasn't that of Genshin Asogi. It was the last will and testament of Lord Klint van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">No...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">WHAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That...is what it would mean, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">No! Impossible! That is utterly out of the question!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Lord van Zieks...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Klint was pursuing the Professor. It consumed him day and night. Whatever happened, he would never have abandoned his investigation before its conclusion. Never! He wouldn't rest until the job was done... Until the killer was caught... The idea that he would willingly accept his own death... It's obscene!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">And yet we can be sure that he was writing his will moments before his death.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And that Genshin Asogi came to be in possession of that document. So what could the will possibly have contained...?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Clearly something that couldn't be made public under any circumstances whatsoever. Because armed with that document, my father was able to negotiate with the judiciary for his life. It was something so damning that it prompted the powers that be to enact that daring jailbreak plot. Yes, there can be no question that the will contained information of the utmost secrecy!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Information...of the utmost secrecy... AAAAAAH! <thought>No... It, it couldn't be...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I've heard more than enough. Pursuing this notion of a phantom will nobody can attest to having seen serves absolutely no purpose.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">No, My Lord, that's unacceptable!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What did you say, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The last will and testament that Genshin Asogi had in his possession was that of Lord Klint van Zieks. All the testimony and evidence presented to the court has logically led us to that as a possibility. We have a duty...to pursue the line of reasoning to its conclusion!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">But with no possible means of knowing the contents of the document, there is no line of reasoning to pursue!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>A reason why Lord Klint van Zieks, a man of high noble standing, would have chosen death... Information so secret, people in the judiciary would be willing to negotiate the jailbreak of a condemned killer... The only explanation that fits those facts... is an unthinkable truth that turns absolutely everything on its head! But...it's just too hideous...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">However difficult the situation might become... ...you work with your client in pursuit of the truth. That's what you resolved to do when you entered the courtroom this morning, if I'm not mistaken.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So hold your head high and keep soldiering on!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Yes, you're right. Ten years ago, in his final moments, Lord Klint van Zieks left behind a will. A will that Genshin Asogi was able to use as a weapon to negotiate his escape from prison. In all probability, the details in the will were related to the Professor case.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The defence's last statement is mere conjecture.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What are you getting at, man?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Ryunosuke?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>As soon as these words come out of my mouth, there's no going back...</thought> I believe that the last will and testament of Lord Klint van Zieks was in fact...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It seems to me that it was probably some kind of report.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Some kind of...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, remember that Lord Klint van Zieks was a well-bred and fastidious man. Knowing the end was near, he probably wanted to tie up the loose ends of all his outstanding business.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My brother had no outstanding business.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Klint would have a full account written the instant there was even a hint of something to report!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...He must have worn out a lot of pens.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">In any case, a business report would never be penned in scarlet ink, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... <thought>I forgot to consider the ink colour.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">It's apparent that the defence's explanation has no real substance. This line of enquiry is dead!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Come on, Ryunosuke! I know you! You've seen to the heart of all this, haven't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Obviously it must have been an accusation!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">An accusation?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, revealing the true identity of the Professor!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Which would explain why Asogi took it, since it was he who was implicated by the document.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! In that case, the will wouldn't have given Mr Asogi any bargaining power at all.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Then you're suggesting the accusation was against some other person?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! If that were the case, the two men would surely have collaborated to pursue the culprit together!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Then your whole argument falls down!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAAAARGH! Uuugh... <thought>Can I object to the penalty, too?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">It's apparent that the defence's explanation has no real substance. This line of enquiry is dead!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Come on, Ryunosuke! I know you! You've seen to the heart of all this, haven't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You can do this, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I believe that what Lord Klint van Zieks actually penned that day... ...was a confession.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">A, a confession...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Regarding the mass murderer known as the Professor... and his true identity!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Lord van Zieks, I appreciate this must be hard to take in... ...but it's the only explanation that fits!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The killer that terrorised London a decade ago, and became known as the Professor... The man believed to have murdered five members of the aristocracy... ...wasn't Genshin Asogi at all.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...! No... You can't be suggesting...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was in fact the man believed to have been the fifth victim... ...Lord Klint van Zieks himself!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Grrrrrr......... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...It's finally open, is it? Pandora's box...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... My... My brother...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, this is too awful... Poor Lord van Zieks...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I wonder, though... Did he never suspect?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Lord Barok van Zieks is a brilliant prosecutor. Is it conceivable that he didn't realise what his older brother really was...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Order! Order! Order in court!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Lord van Zieks...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The Professor made use of an enormous hound as his 'murder weapon'. Tell me...did your brother own a dog?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Yes. He did. Balmung. He was a well known hunting dog. People called him a giant.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I don't believe this...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">When my brother would go hunting in the forest of the grounds behind the house, he always took Balmung. After Klint's death, the creature passed away too... almost as if he were following his master. He was a magnificent hunting dog...worthy of the jewel-studded collar around his neck.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A jewel-studded collar...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">That's right. Though sadly... ...some years ago now it was stolen by a thief who broke into the house one night.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>A jewel-studded collar, stolen by a thief...</thought> It so happens, that myself and my colleagues have come across such a collar during our time in London.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...How could you...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There was an old emblem attached to the collar, too, made of pure gold. It was topped with a small crown and bore an ornate capital letter 'B'...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">W-What?! An emblem bearing the initial 'B'?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! You know it?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...It's the insignia of the Baskerville family.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">WHAT?! The Baskerville... <thought>Why is THAT name coming up now...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Baskerville is the family name of my late brother's widow. That pure gold emblem was an heirloom, which Klint acquired upon their marriage. There can be no doubt then. The collar you've described was Balmung's.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The family insignia of Lord Klint van Zieks's widow...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There was a considerable amount of blood on the collar when we saw it. Since we know the dog was used for hunting, it could have been from its quarry, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But it could equally have been from human prey.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So in fact, the person responsible for these murders of nobles and royals was a noble himself. And that threatened to be an enormous scandal that would irrevocably destabilise British society.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">My father knew that, and was using it to negotiate his way out of the unjust charges brought against him. But at the very last hour, those he'd bargained with betrayed him...slaying him mercilessly on foreign soil.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well? Can you deny it...Lord Stronghart?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Ten years have passed. And still now, the six million inhabitants of our great capital rest easy believing that justice was done. That though his anonymity remains, the diabolical murderer was caught and executed. ......... Very well then. ...You may have the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Tell me then! Tell me what Klint really was!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Lord Klint van Zieks was too pure of heart. When he became a prosecutor and went in pursuit of the black roots of crime, he drove himself into a corner. He came to the uncomfortable realisation... ...that to fight the most fiendish of criminals requires one to become even more fiendish oneself.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........K-Klint...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">It's ironic, really - and somewhat surprising - that the truth has once again been unearthed... ...by a Japanese.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Once again? What do you mean?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Ten years ago, your father, Genshin Asogi, turned up at my office one night...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The Professor?!</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">Yes, beyond all shadow of doubt. You must issue a warrant to search his home at once!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Don't be absurd. The man comes from one of our country's most illustrious families. He's a paragon of justice here in the capital.</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">Yes, that's the point! That's why none of you British can see it! He's using his noble status as a diversion whilst he commits these atrocious crimes behind the scenes!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Do you have evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">......... Nothing definitive as yet. But he keeps an enormous, savage hound on the estate. We need the full support of the judiciary for this! We're up against a member of the aristocracy!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...So a large family estate has a fierce guard dog. You should know that's commonplace here in Britain. I'm sorry, but I can't possibly put Scotland Yard onto this based on the tenuous accusation of a visiting student.</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">So I turned down Asogi's plea. And as a result...he took it upon himself to visit the van Zieks mansion on his own. We can only imagine now what happened between the two men. Though we know the outcome of course: Lord Klint van Zieks perished.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I don't believe this...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So, in actual fact...Kazuma-sama's father did...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He made the late Lord van Zieks meet the same fate... <thought>He put a permanent end to the Professor killings... ...by taking the drastic measure of ending the perpetrator's life!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">As soon as I heard, I hurried to the mansion. When I arrived, it was easy to grasp what had happened.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">And? What about the will?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Asogi must have already taken it. Nothing of that nature was found at the scene. We had no idea of the existence of such a document at that time. I was the only person who knew of the true identity of the Professor. So...I resolved to keep it a secret and to guard the secret to the bitter end.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">S-So you're admitting to it? That...you were behind it all?!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">It was you, then, who pinned the crimes on my father!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...I did what needed to be done in order to protect the law and order of the British Empire. Even if that meant employing an unforgivable ruse.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then it was you who arranged this fabricated evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I ordered that detective to take care of it. Whilst keeping the truth from him, naturally.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Gregson...?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Obviously, he opposed me at first.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Are you off your rocker?! We can't do somethin' like that!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">There's no question that it was Asogi who murdered Lord van Zieks. The house staff have made statements that they saw the man running from the mansion that night.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, well...I've no doubt it was that Japanese fella. But we haven't got a shred of conclusive evidence against the man! And worse than that, he doesn't keep a dog. So we're short of a murder weapon to boot!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And we're short on time, Gregson!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">We must put a stop to this man's rampage! For the good of the country! So we'll use whatever means necessary. ...Do I make myself clear, detective?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...Blimey...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So that night ten years ago...when I was attacked by those thugs in the back streets... ...and Genshin's ring was taken. That was him, was it? That was Gregson and some 'hired help'?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Then the detective handed the stolen ring to Dr Wilson... ...who feigned its discovery from the victim's stomach during that autopsy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And in the light of that 'decisive' evidence, Mr Asogi was found guilty of the charges brought against him. However, behind the scenes... ...he had actually already struck a deal with his accusers... ...in which he agreed to silently accept the charges.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But I just don't believe that part. As far as I knew the man, my father despised such underhand dealings.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...It was extremely easy to make him comply. You see, he had one crippling weakness.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">W-What weakness?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Isn't it obvious? You...Kazuma Asogi.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">M-Me?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Perhaps you have no desire to return to your homeland, Asogi.</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">What?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Though I hear you have a fourteen-year-old son. Agree to cooperate and accept your guilt without contention... ...and you will see Japan - and your son - again.</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">You...you scoundrel!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Whether you choose wisely or not... ...it will be a closed trial, by order of Her Majesty. So whatever rash claims you might make in court, we'll have no trouble in stifling them. There's only one outcome for you, Asogi: the gallows.</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">Don't forget that I still have a weapon at my disposal. A document revealing a truth that I know you're desperate to keep hidden.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Yes, it hadn't escaped my mind. Which is the only reason I'm willing to bargain with you. I only want to protect this country's law and order, you understand. So...what's it to be, Asogi?</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">......... ...Ka.........Kazuma... .........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">He...he did it for me...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And as I told him at the time, my motive was simply to protect Britain from the damage the truth would do. To protect this country's law and order...at any cost.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... A rather brilliant idea, wouldn't you say... Lord Barok van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">That the spirit of your late brother - that paragon of justice - should return to reap justice for his sibling. Could there be a more appetising tale for London's masses, I ask you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What...what brazen...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I knew that you'd play the part to perfection. But your role really wasn't that of some embodiment of Death. No, you were London's guardian angel.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">An angel with bloody hands? I think not.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Those who had cooperated with me already were only too happy to participate in my plan. Inspector Gregson...Dr Wilson... My minions worked tirelessly to ensure that the finger of guilt could never come to rest on you. It's all thanks to them that you were exalted as the demigod the Reaper became.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But Dr Wilson left Britain four years ago when he was invited to work in Japan.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">That's right. So I had to employ the services of his young protégée after that. Dr Courtney Sithe.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Dr Sithe...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">So what with the execution of the Professor and the subsequent reign of the Reaper of the Bailey... ...I've successfully safeguarded law and order in our mighty capital for the past decade. That...is everything.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">My lords, ladies and gentlemen...I do hereby confess. It was I who sired the concept of the Reaper. However...let me say in my defence... ...it was all for the preservation of law and order across the entire empire!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">There is no one left now who can reveal the precise truth of what happened ten years ago. Therefore, this trial can go no further. Now, I would like to entreat all those present... Beyond these four walls, nobody need know the truth. Even Her Majesty must be protected from this. I trust you all appreciate the importance of my request. It is of course for the good of the country.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>Can, can he do this? Can the trial really end now?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">......... I have one last question... ...for the accused, Lord van Zieks.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Of course, I know that you're a highly accomplished prosecutor. So I find it hard to believe...that you didn't have any doubts at all. That you never suspected your older brother.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, the same thought occurred to me.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... It was only once, but...yes. I couldn't say that I never had my doubts.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My brother's sense of justice was extremely strong. Perhaps...too strong, I observed. At that time, there were members of the aristocracy who were bleeding the country dry for their own gain. And since they were nobles, they were untouchable. For my brother, it was a source of great turmoil.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And coincidentally at the same time, the Professor began his terrifying reign.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">During the time of the Professor killings, my brother did not appear to be himself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And that made you suspect?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Yes. But it was only once. Not more.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Only once? Really?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Klint wasn't the culprit. That was my conclusion at the time. And I still believe that now.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Do you have any evidence to support that idea?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The third victim...was the Lord Chief Justice at the time. It was he who had recognised my brother's potential and trained him as a prosecutor. No matter what the circumstances, it's unthinkable that my brother could have killed his friend and mentor!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...That will do.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Neither Klint van Zieks nor Genshin Asogi still walk this earth. However much we debate this matter now, we cannot hope to reach a conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">B-But...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">There are only two extant pieces of evidence from the time: The woebegone ring that acted as the incriminating evidence to condemn Genshin Asogi. And the three-paged last will and testament penned in black ink and left behind by the man. The wretched truth of what happened is exactly as I have explained. Later today, I will present myself at the Ministry of Justice for whatever sanction is deemed appropriate. That is all. Court is adjourned!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thank you...Kazuma.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Me...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have made this eleventh-hour discovery.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What discovery?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord! I'm afraid...I must insist the trial continues!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As the court has been reminded today already: we must stop at nothing to uncover the whole truth. And to that end, one particular statement made by somebody in this courtroom moments ago... ...revealed a very subtle contradiction.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What contradiction?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But...all I did was ask the accused one simple question!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, it began with Lord van Zieks and his recollection about his brother. But Lord Stronghart didn't permit the defendant to speak at length.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I merely pointed out that we can draw no further useful conclusions here. So where on earth is the contradiction?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>One of them definitely just said something contradictory. It's time to identify who!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>It was Lord van Zieks, I'm sure of it! Something about what he said was just a little jarring. Come on, Ryunosuke! Go over it again! Find it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Klint wasn't the culprit. That was my conclusion at the time. The third victim...was the Lord Chief Justice at the time. It was he who had recognised my brother's potential and trained him as a prosecutor. No matter what the circumstances, it's unthinkable that my brother could have killed his friend and mentor!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Lord van Zieks...would you care to explain?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What exactly am I supposed to make of those pitiful Nipponese eyes?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When you were recounting the information about your brother and the third victim just now... ...something you said was inconsistent with a certain piece of evidence we have.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Inconsistent...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And even though that inconsistency arose from words out of the defendant's mouth... ...we have a duty here to pursue an explanation!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What are you playing at?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I fail to see the defence's intention here, but clearly the court cannot ignore this new development. What evidence is inconsistent with the defendant's words?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Stronghart:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I have the distinct impression that permitting you to advocate for me was the mistake of my life.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">And don't you dare to show your face again at my door once this trial is over.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...It's going to be very lonely around the Naruhodo dinner table in future...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Not as long as I'm alive, Mr Naruhodo! I'm sure we need only think again to fix the situation!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh my! Miss Susato! Yes! Of, of course!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>It was Lord Stronghart, I'm sure of it! Something he said was slightly off. Come on, Ryunosuke! Think back over his words! Find the problem!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Neither Klint van Zieks nor Genshin Asogi still walk this earth. However much we debate this matter now, we cannot hope to reach a conclusion. There are only two extant pieces of evidence from the time: The woebegone ring that acted as the incriminating evidence to condemn Genshin Asogi. And the three-paged last will and testament penned in black ink and left behind by the man.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Lord Stronghart...would you care to explain?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Explain what, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Among the statements you made just a few moments ago... ...something you said was inconsistent with a certain piece of evidence we have.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Inconsistent...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And whilst an inconsistency remains... ...the defence has a right to pursue an explanation!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Ryunosuke, what...?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Let me warn you about the statements you are making, Counsel. They may very well prove fatal. You claim my words contained a contradiction? With which piece of evidence, I ask you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Stronghart:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I have the distinct impression that permitting you to advocate for me was the mistake of my life.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">And don't you dare to show your face again at my door once this trial is over.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...It's going to be very lonely around the Naruhodo dinner table in future...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Not as long as I'm alive, Mr Naruhodo! I'm sure we need only think again to fix the situation!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh my! Miss Susato! Yes! Of, of course!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This here is the will left behind by Mr Asogi. The two-paged will.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yet moments ago, your precise words were: 'The three-paged last will and testament.'</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Could it be that originally... ...there was a third page?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... For a moment...I thought perhaps you'd identified something worthwhile. But it's a mere trifle, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A trifle?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Governor Caidin!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Eh...? W-What can I do for you, SIIIIIIR?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You were present when the Japanese man penned his last will and testament.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Aye! I was there, for sure! I remember the black, werum-like scrawls to this day! And... ...I'm quite certain, My Lord...that there was a third page at the time!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Wha... WHAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Only the first two pages were the actual will, though. If I mind correctly, the third...was a message to his lad back in Japan.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">For legal purposes, we required only his will.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">And we would'nae have wanted any...uncomfortable words aboot Britain to get back to Japan, eh. So it was decided that the third page ought'nae to be sent.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">How dare you make that decision?! I had a right to know what it said! To hear my father's final words to me!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The courtroom is no place for sentimentality, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">As it happens, I have the third page o' the document wi' me here now.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">My, my father's message!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">It will be given to you at the end of these proceedings.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>It'll be too late once the trial is over. We need to know what it says now. Even the slightest thing may give us a vital clue!</thought> My Lord! The defence calls for Genshin Asogi's last words to his son...to be read out loud before the court now!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Your request is denied. The inevitably maudlin words can be of no consequence now.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The prosecution agrees. The court should know the content of that message! Every possible piece of evidence must be thoroughly examined!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Very well, then. Governor Caidin... ...you will read the third page of the document for all present to hear!</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Yes, SIIIIIIR! Only...I should point oot, My Lord... ...that I cannae actually read werum language.</line>
<line speaker="???">This beautiful handwriting? ...Shame on you, Barry.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">If I could be of assistance here...? I would be happy to translate the words into English for the court.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Father!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... You're still here, are you, Dr Mikotoba?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Naturally. I consider myself a member of the judiciary... albeit a lowly one. But perhaps I should quietly withdraw after I've translated Genshin's message.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Your cooperation is much appreciated.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">...That's the end of the message, it would seem.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A haiku poem? Twist thy head...?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Father...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What is 'Karuma'?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The name of the Asogi clan's famous sword. A razor-sharp blade known to all, passed down for generations. It embodies the Japanese spirit.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...It's not known to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's the 'katana' sword that was submitted as evidence earlier in these proceedings. The one worn by the prosecution counsel when he... confronted Inspector Gregson.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">All these procrastinations are beginning to try my patience. Adjournment of this court is long overdue. As the presiding judge, I have been as accommodating as possible of the will of the courtroom. However, despite all that...no new information has come to light.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Mighty Karuma, Twist thy head and watch them fall, All thy mortal foes!' <thought>That's the proper way to use the sword, is it? Maybe I should try it...</thought> ...It hurts my neck, that's the trouble.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Um, Mr Naruhodo...if I might make a suggestion? I think perhaps it doesn't mean YOUR head.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I once studied the history and development of the katana some time ago... ...and as I'm sure you're probably aware, the sword's 'head' is the part at the very end of the hilt. It's written as 'head' in Japanese, but it's pronounced as 'kashira' I believe.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kashira...? So Mr Asogi's words really mean, 'twist the butt of the hilt'...? You, you don't think...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look what's inside it!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Is, is that... ...a tightly wound sheet of parchment?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">S-Scarlet ink! It's written in scarlet ink! 'I pen this, my last will and testament, in the final moments before my inevitable and willing death.' This, this is it, isn't it...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! Look at the signature at the end!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Klint van Zieks... And the date...ten years ago, on that fateful night!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So for ten years...it's been silently concealed inside Karuma and nobody knew... The last will and testament of Lord Klint van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Wait... Oh my goodness... <thought>Look at this... This is unbelievable...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Twist thy head and watch them fall, All thy mortal foes...' Kazuma's father certainly had a way with words.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And he certainly thought up an ingenious hiding place, too. It seems almost playful at first, but I do wonder if over the years perhaps... ...the duties of the Asogi clan have actually called for such inventiveness.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Protecting great secrets, you mean? Those sorts of duties? <thought>Well, I could believe that. Kazuma conducts himself like someone with the weight of his clan's long and noble history on his shoulders.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">In pursuit of justice, Lord Klint van Zieks tragically lost all sense of morality. When he murdered his former mentor, clearly he was already devoid of his normal faculties.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Too much time has passed. We cannot ever hope to know more than we do now. Especially since the alleged will that he penned in his final moments appears to have been lost forever.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Argh!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Lord Stronghart...you appear to be in something of a hurry to wrap things up. I wonder why...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">We've heard you state time and again during these proceedings... ...that everything you did was in the interests of protecting British law and order.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And I stand by that. Without the Reaper, we could never have achieved the reduction in crime the capital has seen.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What about Inspector Gregson then?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">And Dr Wilson. They were no criminals. You used them to achieve your ends...and then you had them killed!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">However you dress it up...there was nothing fair or just about that!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Lord Stronghart... ...what exactly is it that you're hiding?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Dr Mikotoba... ...were you not to quietly withdraw after the translation of your former associate's will?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">In this courtroom, no argument carries weight unless it is supported by evidence. And it would seem that the defence has no more evidence to present.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">In which case... ...I hereby order all discourse from these proceedings to be struck from the record!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This is my last chance...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I have to present some decisive evidence now, or it's all over. ...But can I?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait, My Lord! As it happens...the defence does have evidence to present!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Wha...? Don't be absurd! There is nothing of relevance remaining from the time!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>At critical times like this, I've always found myself thinking it's best to wait and see what happens.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I can't help feeling that perhaps you've missed countless opportunities as a result...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How...?! How could you possibly know my life has been one long list of missed opportunities?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But you have a new opportunity here, Mr Naruhodo. For a change of direction! But you must be quick, before Lord Stronghart's improvised gavel hits the bench!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">That is all! This court is adjourned!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Not yet, My Lord! As it happens...the defence does have evidence to present!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Whatever evidence you think you have, I'm quite sure it's deserving of this.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ah, my life-altering change of direction came just a fraction too late...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">There is quite simply nothing else of relevance remaining from the time!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It's high time that you realised something...My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">This gentleman has an uncanny habit... ...of producing evidence at the final hour that had escaped everyone else's attention!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Nonsense...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What is it, Ryunosuke?! What do you have?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I dare say... ...the final, decisive piece of evidence... that will reveal the whole truth about this rotten tale!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">How, how can you...?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Decisive...?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Well, it would appear there's no escaping it now, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Let it be so, then. Present whatever you think you have that can settle this decade-old enigma...if you're capable. What exactly is this evidence that the defence claims to be so decisive?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Stronghart:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And this evidence clearly demonstrates you're not! You're capable only of destroying your own argument!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAAAARH! <thought>Come on, Ryunosuke. We know that Asogi-san negotiated with Lord Stronghart ten years ago... ...using the last will and testament of Lord Klint van Zieks as bargaining power.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">And yet after his death, that document couldn't be found in his cell at the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...does the fact that it was never found mean...? <thought>Could it still be hidden somewhere, undiscovered after all these years?</thought> My Lord, the defence DOES have that evidence! And I'm ready to present it now!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Well...it seems you're intent on more self-destruction.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There is a single piece of evidence that can clarify what really happened ten years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The last will and testament of Lord Klint van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Hah! A wonderfully astute observation, I'm sure. But in case it had escaped your notice...that document was lost long ago.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right, it was. Only... ...I have it right here. Discovered just moments ago.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Im-Impossible! That can't be!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Everything that's happened...comes back to this will. This document... ...is the key that will unlock the entire mystery!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Grrrrrr... GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My, my brother's last will and testament... Where did you find that?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was rolled up inside this.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I-Inside Karuma?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That ultimate weapon Genshin Asogi obtained has lain undisturbed in the hilt of this sword all these years... ...just waiting for the right time to emerge...and reveal the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">The signature and seal certainly look official.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... My God, it's true... It's my brother's handwriting! There can be no mistake!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I forbid the contents of that document from being read out! Do you hear me? I strictly forbid it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You can't do that, My Lord. This document could explain everything!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">That document could literally destroy the meaning of justice in this country! I demand that you hand it to me...AT ONCE!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why? What are you trying to hide?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Could it be... ...that you already know what's written on this page?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Argh! W-What are you implying?! Court is adjourned with immediate effect! Clear the courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Forcibly ending a trial without good reason? And not any trial. A closed trial by order of Her Majesty the Queen. To defy the monarch's will is treason!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Grrrrrr...</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Well well, My Lord... ...it would rather appear as though proceedings aren't going to go quite as you'd hoped.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You... You fools...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Go ahead, Ryunosuke. Read it! The prosecution...gives its full support!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Very well then...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">No... For God's sake... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So now we know! Yes, Klint van Zieks was a murderer... ...but somebody was directing him and naming his victims. His extortioner, Lord Mael Stronghart...it was you!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Lord Stronghart, a moment ago... ...you claimed that what the court has just heard could destroy justice in this country. But you weren't trying to protect justice at all. All you were trying to do... ...was conceal the secret of your true nature and the countless lives you've sacrificed up till now!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...It just didn't make sense to me. That the third victim, the former Lord Chief Justice, was my brother's benefactor, and a man of lofty principles. As I said...Klint had no possible reason to kill the man!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But you did, didn't you, Lord Stronghart? To eliminate the man who stood between you and the office you'd set your sights on! So you used your own hunting dog - Lord Klint van Zieks - to take him down!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... It had to be done.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">London's unsavoury shadows are deep, and the arm of the law fails to reach their depths. Crime must be cut off at the roots! But the Lord Chief Justice at the time couldn't see that! He was weak! Lofty principles, you say? Tantamount to cowardice if you ask me! Which is why I took his place. In order to fight the crime he was allowing to spread like wildfire.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">By murdering the man?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The Reaper...the Professor...the name makes no difference. As I've explained countless times already, it was all done for the furtherance of law and order in London!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Are you going to legitimise the murder of my father now, too?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Ah, Genshin Asogi... Well, that was unfortunate. I had fully intended to send him back to Japan as we'd agreed.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I don't believe you! It was you, wasn't it? You killed him!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... No, it wasn't me who took your father's life.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then who?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">On the night following his mock execution... ...I went to Lowgate Cemetery at three in the morning with Jigoku.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">J-Judge Jigoku?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">There had to be a collaborator on the Japanese side to manage Asogi's treatment after his repatriation. Jigoku had fierce ambition. ...It made him easy to manipulate. Ten years ago, after he'd stood trial for the destruction of the witness stand, I had words with him. When I told him the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs could be his, he couldn't agree fast enough!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Seishiro... You fool...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">As you know, Asogi escaped the prison in a closed casket and was subsequently interred. We intended to dig him out of his grave before he ran out of air. But sadly...all did not go to plan.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Enoch Drebber...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Of course, I knew graverobbers frequented London's cemeteries. But that grave on that particular night...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">When I later learnt of the waxwork modeller's presence at the scene as well, I made her swear to two things: Never to remove the Professor's mask. And never to speak of the events of that night. And with that...the secret was buried along with Asogi's corpse. So...now you know what really happened in Lowgate Cemetery that night.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">It was Jigoku, your Japanese acquaintance, who killed Asogi in the end, you see. He claimed to be the man's friend, but when push came to shove, he pulled the trigger.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Just before Mr Jigoku left the courtroom earlier... ...he said that the assassin exchange proposal was a demand from his British counterpart, not a request.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So you coerced him, too? Using what happened in the graveyard!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">By that time, Jigoku was the Minister of Foreign Affairs negotiating international treaties with Britain. You can imagine what would have happened if it came to light he'd murdered a compatriot ten years earlier. He would have lost everything. ...I merely reminded him of that.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">How do you sleep at night...?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... These past ten years, I've fought tirelessly with the darker recesses of London's criminal underworld. And I've used whatever means necessary to ensure that justice prevails and law and order reign supreme!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That couldn't be further from the truth. The fact is...you haven't fought crime at all!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">How dare you?! I saved Klint van Zieks from dishonour in his death!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Whilst behind the scenes, you systematically buried anyone who stood in your way. And then you made my father take the blame!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">It was unavoidable! It was the only way to protect our justice system and public order!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Let's not forget the others you had killed as well. Setting the defendant up as the Reaper to cover up the truth behind the murders of countless more!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">That's...ENOOOUGH! Do you have any idea of the conniving that led to the acquittals of those WRETCHED criminals?! We have to fight fire with fire! Our courts can't function without a Reaper! Can't you see all I've done for this country?! This has been my struggle!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You've done nothing! It's Lord van Zieks here who worked tirelessly and justly in court, whilst enduring the disgrace of the Reaper name!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And Inspector Gregson! Fraught with anguish for having sullied his hands through a desire to do the right thing! Not to mention Genshin Asogi, who risked his life going in pursuit of the truth you tried to hide! No, the darker recesses of London's underworld...were largely filled by you!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You little... When will you get it through your thick skulls...?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">That it was all for Queen and Country? I'm tiring of that excuse. You've consistently twisted the truth for bargaining power to make others do your bidding. Nothing more.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">People who willingly twist the truth and coerce others have no right to call themselves part of the judiciary! I strongly suggest, you don't EVER talk of justice again!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Grrr... Garrrrrrrrr... GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Well, well, well... Dear me, my good fellows! Dear me! A well-deserved round of applause, I think, for a quite marvellous performance!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">W-What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Those delightfully grave expressions! That beautifully pronounced Queen's English! Really, our friends from the Far East are quite the picture of industriousness!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You fraud... Keep your mockery!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Please, don't misunderstand! It really is exactly as you've both said.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What are you trying to say?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I have occupied the darker recesses of London's underworld and - how did you put it? 'Done nothing'? I confess it's a little embarrassing to have it pointed out quite so starkly, but yes... ...I really have 'done nothing'. Which means... ...I can be indicted for nothing. ...No?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">WHAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">It's true! Personally, I have committed no crime! I've merely been surrounded by fools who've acted very rashly indeed!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You, you can't get away with that! You've consistently preyed on people's weaknesses...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And what? Threatened them? Are you sure it wasn't just bargaining? I would like to address all the good lords, ladies and gentlemen of the judiciary here present. You all know of these darker recesses in our great capital. And deep down, I believe you also know... ...that to fight those who dwell there requires at least some of us to occupy the darkness ourselves.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">So let me appeal to your good sense now. Consider the situation with me... If this catalogue of horrifying revelations... ...were to become common knowledge among the six million inhabitants of London, what might happen?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">To learn that the infamous murderer of royals and nobles was a respected member of the aristocracy himself... That evidence was fabricated in the scapegoat's trial amid secret negotiations with prosecutors to effect a jailbreak... That the Reaper of the Bailey was an organised group of assassins managed by a Scotland Yard inspector... And finally... ...that it was all masterminded by the Lord Chief Justice himself!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">If the general public of Britain knew the truth... ...all faith in the police and Prosecutor's Office would be completely lost...without doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Public order in the capital would completely break down. We'd be cast back to the lawless days of the last century.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Precisely. As it was a hundred years ago, when one in ten of the population were criminals. Think what we've accomplished since then: a public policing force, a comprehensive set of laws... And if we want to continue to protect this new era of law and order... ...I say again: we must at times occupy the darkness ourselves! We have successfully identified and apprehended the man responsible for taking Inspector Gregson's life. That is all that was expected of this trial. All these other matters that have been discussed... ...will be eliminated from the minutes of these proceedings...in the interests of preserving law and order! And to protect Her Majesty the Queen, of course. Well, my lords, ladies and gentlemen? What say you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Are, are you hearing this?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">This is the will of the British judiciary?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">For your rousing response, friends... I express my heartfelt gratitude. Therefore, in accordance with the overwhelming wishes of the court, the records shall be erased!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>You have to respect the man's ability to turn a situation to his favour... Lord Stronghart really is a master of manipulation.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">You've conclusively proven his guilt. Yet he still manages to evade justice. I, I just don't know what we can do...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Ryunosuke...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>It looks like the trial really is going to come to an end now. I'm almost out of options, I think.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes, when all the games are over, it's the obvious choice... Let my voice reverberate around the courtroom and make people listen to reason!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">As a man who has fought many battles in this very courtroom, let me offer some advice. Objections need substance behind them. Otherwise...they are merely objectionable.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... The defence...has no objection to being penalised in this instance.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Fear not, Mr Naruhodo! I certainly won't object if you decided to make...perhaps a wiser choice now?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Y-Yes, right! A wise choice. Of course. Here it comes... </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>At critical times like this, I've always found myself thinking it's best to wait and see what happens.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">I can't help feeling that perhaps you've missed countless opportunities as a result...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How...?! How could you possibly know my life has been one long list of missed opportunities?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Then let us never have this discussion again!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Bailiff! Sequester the minutes of the trial!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Not so fast, My Lord! The defence has evidence to present!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You're always tardy, Counsel. I have no sympathy for tardiness.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ugh...the resolve of Ryunosuke Naruhodo materialises a fraction too late again...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Fear not, Mr Naruhuodo! I certainly won't object if you decided to make...perhaps a wiser choice now?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Y-Yes, right! A wise choice. Of course. Here it comes...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Yes, as I know only too well... ...the only thing that carries any weight in court...is hard evidence!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">B-But, Mr Naruhodo... ...what evidence is there to use at this stage in the trial?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I have an idea. I don't know whether anything will come of it, but... <thought>...if there was ever a time for using this particular item we have among the evidence, it's now!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Susato:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">W-Why are you looking at me with those... disappointed eyes?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I am your judicial assistant, Mr Naruhodo. I shall stand by you until the bitter end. ...No matter what misguided choices you might make!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's...very heartwarming...I think. But please, I can't bear that look! <thought>I suppose we've used all of the evidence that's relevant to the case now. But I'm sure I was asked to take charge of a certain item for use in emergencies. I'd better find it quickly! Stronghart's cane is only a hair's breadth from the bench!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! Yes, Mr Sholmes asked if you had that with you earlier...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We've exposed all of Lord Stronghart's wrongdoing now. I've no doubt that Mr Sholmes had already deduced exactly how the truth would unfurl.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So I think it must be time for the great detective to take centre stage, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Yes, absolutely! Let's take the hare by the ears, then! And heave!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright, here goes! HEEEEEEAVE!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">AAAAAAAAAH! M-Mr Naruhodo...he's...?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I, I wasn't expecting you back, Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Delighted to be here again...Lord Stronghart.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What, what is the meaning of this? Bailiff! Seize him! Put that man in irons! This is... This is a closed court! You've been warned once already, man!</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">W-Wot the... We, we can't get an 'old of 'im, My Lord! We, we just go right through 'im!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I'm afraid your efforts are wasted. You see... ...the great detective you see before you, is composed entirely of light and shadow. An image, if you will. Mr Naruhodo, I must congratulate you on your fine deductions.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">M-Mr Sholmes! What on earth is...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you familiar, I wonder, with the invention known as the telephone?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, well yes... I hear that some public telephones have been installed recently in Tokyo.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The sound of the speaker's voice is converted to an electrical signal and transmitted instantly to another place.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Quite. Sounds are transmitted. So could not images keep them company, I mused. Iris and I did some modest experimentation to develop such a device specifically for this very day.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">'Modest experimentation', Mr Sholmes? What a modest description!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And, somewhat incidentally, I thought we might just as well transit an entire scene.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Somewhat incidentally', Mr Sholmes? Now you're just being immodest!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Do, do you mean to say...you're not actually here, Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, I knew my trusty partner would have no trouble grasping the concept.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Except he's grasping the stand to steady himself after your shock arrival.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Poor Father... I would have hoped he might have been forewarned, being the great detective's great partner.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Leave my courtroom at once! Get out! Or I swear to you...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Dear me. You on the other hand, Lord Stronghart, appear to have a very poor grasp of the situation. Allow me to reiterate: I am not 'here'. Which would, I hope, lead naturally to one asking...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Where exactly are you?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The very question I was awaiting! I am at present enjoying the air in a rather splendid garden.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A garden?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Not just any garden, you understand. A garden at Buckingham Palace.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">What?! You, you can't be! Buckingham Palace?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's Buckingham Palace, Miss Susato? I've never heard of it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Do you ever read the news, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...Mr Sholmes... ...is Iris with you there?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, well now... Iris is currently enjoying some tea... ...with Her Majesty.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Her, Her Majesty?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Not just any 'Her Majesty' you understand. Her Majesty the Queen of the British Empire.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What on earth is all this about?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Buckingham Palace is Her Majesty the Queen's residence in London, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Order! Order in court! I demand immediate silence! Her, Her Majesty the Queen? You can't be...? I mean... No... This, this is some sort of unforgivably distasteful trickery by a third-rate detective, that's all!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">'Unforgivably distasteful trickery'... What an apt description. A closed court session attended by elite members of the judiciary is a rare event. I presumed that Her Majesty would be more than a little curious about the proceedings. So...I decided to show her. Everything...from start to finish.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh?! You showed her?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed. By dint of the Herlock Sholmes Remote Cinematograph!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You...meddling...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">This is some kind of nightmare...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Just as I appear to be standing before you, regaling you with talk of my latest invention... ...no doubt you've inferred...that the reverse is also true.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You, you don't mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Her Majesty has seen and heard every moment of the proceedings. I assumed there would be no objection. After all... ...every trial in this country is conducted under the auspices of Her Majesty, as you know!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You... You...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I confess, I am quite impatient to hear Her Majesty's opinion... ...about the 'unforgivably distasteful trickery' in which you've been engaged over the past ten years.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">N-No! I, I was merely...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, so sorry to keep you all waiting! Vicky and I had so much to talk about!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Iris! There you are!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">In fact, I have a little message here from Her Majesty.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">A, a message...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well then, if everyone is sitting comfortably? Ahem... 'Forthwith and with immediate effect, all authority previously afforded to Mael Stronghart... ...is hereby revoked for evermore.'</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">'Furthermore, he will be prosecuted for crimes against his country in a public trial by jury in the coming days.'</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So...it seems that Her Majesty doesn't believe we need to fight fire with fire. Justice in this country needn't be administered from the shadows at all.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mael Stronghart... ...the darkness you fostered to conceal your despicable actions these last ten years is a thing of the past now. After today... ...your brand of 'law and order' has no future. Because no longer are you the Lord Chief Justice... In the eyes of the law, and of Her Majesty the Queen... you are nothing...but a criminal!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Adjourned! Adjourned! Adjourned! Adjourned! Adjourned! COURT IS ADJOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURNED!!!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">'Lord Klint van Zieks left a will in which he confessed to everything.' When those words came out of Asogi's mouth... it deranged me completely. I knew I must do anything and everything in my power to contain the situation. But I couldn't find the damned document. I searched his cell, but it wasn't there.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Which precipitated the jailbreak plot, I presume?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">W-What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... The need to obtain that will was all-consuming. I was sure that if I facilitated Asogi's escape, he would emerge with the will somewhere on his person. But despite searching his limp body in the cemetery that night...it still eluded me. It never even crossed my mind that it was concealed in the sword's hilt.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What pains me now... ...is that my brother left this world without a word to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sorry, Lord van Zieks...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">In point of fact... ...I think perhaps that isn't the case.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">How can that be?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There is more to his last will and testament.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">'Asogi is a fine detective, and a hunter worthy of respect. He has agreed to honour my final two wishes. The first is that this document survives. The second...I cannot commit to paper. I have confessed my sins to my wife. May she find resolution in my death. With my eternal gratitude to my Japanese friend, I rest my quill.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Klint...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mael Stronghart... ...you colluded with Seishiro Jigoku in a criminal plot so immense, it spanned the oceans. And you cold-heartedly murdered all those who knew the truth about what happened ten years ago. But why did you set about that now, a whole decade later?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... To ascend to the very peak.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">These last ten years made me realise: Being the Lord Chief Justice wasn't enough. Short of becoming Her Majesty's Attorney General... ...I could have no real power to effect the changes needed in this country. And for that promotion...I needed to ensure no 'remnants' of the past remained.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">How could you...?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I like everything to run smoothly, in the exact manner that I prescribe. Like a well-oiled machine. And I was just a step away...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And for your ambition to succeed... ...did you even bother to count the number of brilliant people you had killed?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, Mr Reaper, are you not forgetting something?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Such as...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You've very much adopted your usual prosecutor-like demeanour in the proceedings now. But the reality of the situation is that you are the defendant in this trial.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">However, the presiding judge would appear to have fallen from the bench, as it were. May I suggest, therefore, that we entrust the final adjudication to an old friend?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">M-My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">As a member of the judiciary, I have been following the proceedings from the gallery. And I must say...I shan't ever forget the extraordinary battle between good and evil that I witnessed here today. The darkness that has blighted justice in our land these past ten years has at last been dispelled. Thanks, in no small part, to the efforts of a bright young star from the East. Defence Counsel Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Y-Yes, My Lord?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">On behalf of everyone here present in the Old Bailey, I give you my heartfelt thanks.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're too kind, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The first time I faced you in court, just under a year ago now... ...I had the faintest of intimations. That if British justice, so warped and twisted over its long history, was finally to know change... ...this might just be the man to do it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But at the time, I wouldn't allow myself to acknowledge the possibility. I couldn't overcome my hatred of the Japanese, after the circumstances of my brother's death. Mr Naruhodo... Allow me to apologise for countless discourtesies on my part. You are a lawyer of boundless talent.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, Lord van Zieks...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... When I first arrived in Great Britain... ...I was literally a nobody. Certainly not a lawyer. The truth is, my fortunes have entirely been made by the miraculous people I've met. My best friend, Kazuma Asogi, who led me here to Britain in the first place... My loyal and ever-patient judicial assistant, Miss Susato, who helped me study to become a lawyer... The brilliant Lord van Zieks, who never failed to challenge his 'Nipponese' rival. And not to mention... ...the exceptional master of logic and reasoning, who showed me the true art of deduction...Mr Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Saving the best for last, Mr Naruhodo? ...What a relief.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm well aware...that without all these people's help and support, I wouldn't be where I am today. The truth is a guiding light that always leads to happiness.  I've lived by that principle for a long time now. But actually, it's not true.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The truth can also cause great pain. Sometimes even leave people on the brink of despair.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">And for that reason, there are those who feel the need to hide the truth. Who do it instinctively, even.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But as soon as we allow our eyes to settle on something other than the truth...the darkness takes hold. And from there it grows, until eventually...it makes us blind to the guiding light of the truth altogether. So that's why it's my belief... ...that we must all resolve never to avert our eyes from what is just and true. So that we can continue to walk the straight and narrow path ahead.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I must excuse myself now. But before I go, Mr Naruhodo, let me compliment you on your grand opus.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Without your beautifully composed case against Lord Stronghart, Her Majesty would have been unable to act. Thanks to you and your fellows, the haunting undertones corrupting Britain's justice system have been silenced!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm... Thank you very much!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So...until our paths cross again somewhere!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well then... ...it would appear that this long trial has finally come to an end.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... My apologies for any anxiety caused, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm quite sure we shall meet again here in the courtroom before long, Prosecutor Barok van Zieks. In conclusion of these proceedings, I hereby declare the defendant, Barok van Zieks...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That is all. Court is adjourned!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>It...really is all over. ...But did I sacrifice too much?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo... I really must congratulate you. It was a truly...truly splendid performance! Honestly...I couldn't be happier for you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, thank you very much. But I really couldn't have done it without you at my side through it all, Miss Susato.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! ......... Your kind words mean so much to me.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">It really was a very splendid show, that, Naruhodo. I'd have thought you'd be smiling from ear to ear, but you look rather glum.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Well...of course I'm delighted about the verdict. But in exposing the truth, I'm afraid I've caused my client a great deal of pain. I'm really not sure that's what a lawyer ought to be doing.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh well, in that case... ...I'm quite sure that when you see Lord van Zieks's smiling face, everything will seem much better!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Um, Miss Susato... ...everything seems worse. He has a face like thunder.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear... I really shouldn't have presumed...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Uh! Um...yes?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Almost a year it's been now, since I first encountered you here in this very courthouse. For you to have risen to the level of excellence you demonstrated today... Well, it's quite remarkable.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but I... I exposed the most unpalatable truth you could ever have imagined in court today. I feel as though I've robbed you of something you held so dear...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... What was it he said? 'To fight those who dwell in the darkness requires at least some of us to occupy the darkness ourselves.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But that... That was just the feeble excuse of a coward. Only those with a steadfast eye for the truth have what it takes to fight the dark forces of crime. You made fine work of establishing that fact in court today.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... Well...thank you!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What magnanimous words! ...I'm quite sure that Kazuma-sama would have a smile on his face at this very moment if he were here!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Kazuma...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Um, Miss Susato... ...there's another face like thunder here.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! And he really was here...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Lord van Zieks... Allow me to congratulate you on your acquittal.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Congratulate me? Or curse me? You failed to bring down the Reaper.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">......... I owe you an apology.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... No, it is I who should apologise. Your father, Genshin... If I had been stronger, then perhaps... I made an unforgivable error of judgement. ...I can offer no excuse.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">......... And I can offer no forgiveness. That said......... ...I suppose you fought for justice and the truth. For that at least, I can't withhold respect.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Your words mean more to me than you could know. I will hold them dear.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Kazuma-sama...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">......... I must say... ...there's one thing that's still bothering me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's that?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">The will that Lord Klint van Zieks wrote before his duel with my father.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">What can the second of his final wishes have been?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">That your father agreed to honour, you mean? Hm...</line>
<line speaker="???">I think perhaps...</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">...I might be able to shed some light on that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Father?!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">It was ten years ago, as you know. The day before... Before the execution was scheduled. I went to the prison to say my farewells to Genshin.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Why aren't you putting up more of a fight, Genshin? If you'd only agree to it, Seishiro and I would gladly petition the government...</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">We've been through this already. You don't need to worry about me. Anyway, Yujin... ...I have a favour to ask of you. Something of great importance.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">You're one of my greatest friends, Genshin. Whatever it is, consider it done.</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">......... I'm going to tell you an address. I need you to go there at once, in secret and telling no one. You should find a lady of the gentry in hiding there.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">A lady of the gentry?</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">She's not in a good way. And she's with child. The birth is imminent. As a medical man, I'd like you to attend to her. Please, you're her only hope.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">By any chance...is the child yours, Genshin?</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">Don't be daft. It's a favour that was asked of me by a man I knew... as his dying wish.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">My goodness...</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">I swore to the man that I would help. That I would do whatever I could for his wife and his unborn child. But if something should happen to me... ...I need to ask you that same favour. You're the only person I know that I can truly rely on.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">W-What did you say? 'If' something should happen to you?! Tomorrow night, you're going to be...! To be.........</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">Heh heh heh... You never know though, do you? What life will bring.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">......... Alright then. Tell me the address. I'll head there at once with Seishiro and-</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">No. Not with him.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Asogi">This is a favour I'm asking of you. And only you, Yujin.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">......... Right. I see. ...Very well, then.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">That very night, I caught a train from Paddington to Dartmoor in Devon. I found the old house. In the middle of nowhere, it was. An old hunting hound lay asleep in the grounds. The poor woman was on the floor at the back of a darkened room. She was in mortal danger. I broke her waters to precipitate the labour before she weakened further, but it was a tortuous birth. I did everything humanly possibly [sic] for her and her child. And in the end, I was lucky enough to welcome a new life into the world. But tragically... ...my efforts to save the mother's life were in vain. I held the healthy newborn girl in my arms and wept for...longer than I care to remember. Eventually, in something of a daze, I looked around the room.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">B-Baskerville?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You mean...the woman was the wife of Lord Klint van Zieks?!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">That's right. The newborn was his daughter.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But...but that makes no sense! Why on earth wouldn't Klint have entrusted the child to my care in that case?! I was completely unaware that he even had a daughter!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose...he didn't really have any choice.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, your brother said that he'd confessed everything to his wife. So she must have been beside herself with worry for her child. If the true identity of the Professor were ever to be made public... ...the girl would be forever branded as the daughter of the infamous mass murderer.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So the only solution... ...was to distance the young girl from the van Zieks family as much as possible.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I...don't believe it...</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I imagine that in his final hour, Lord Klint van Zieks made the obvious choice. He would have thought to himself, 'This Japanese man here is someone I can trust...'</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I honoured my promise to Genshin, of course. However... ...only a month later, I was summoned back to Japan. And without disclosing the parentage of the child, I couldn't obtain permission to take her with me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh how awful...</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I was completely at a loss. In the end, I had to ask my great friend. I asked him if he would be a father to her.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That...being Mr Sholmes, I presume?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Yes. He took one look into my eyes and agreed to it on the spot.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Mr Sholmes... He has a heart of gold...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Really, all it can be said that I did for the child... ...was to give her a name.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">When I'd come to Britain, I was trying to escape from the grief of losing my darling wife. So it was her name that I gave the little girl.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Your wife's name, Professor Mikotoba... In other words...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...The name of my mother... Ayame Mikotoba.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">That's right, Ayame. Or in English...Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Iris...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I, I had no idea...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">OOOUUUCH!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">M-Mr Naruhodo! What's wrong?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Th-This little thing just pinched me on the behind through my trouser pocket! Hard!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, my dear fellows! Can you hear me?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes...is that you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">OOOUUUCH! Yes, yes, we can hear you!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You see what excessive tugging can do? Let that be a lesson to you!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes, we weren't able to thank you properly before, but you were simply marvellous! Your checkmate move was a stroke of genius!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed it was, wasn't it? I surpassed myself, I feel. It had become apparent to me that to stop the Lord Chief Injustice would require such measures.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ruuuno! Suuusie!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, I'm so pleased! What a wonderful outcome! Her Majesty Queen Vicky said she thought my special blend was delicious!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, um...I'm sure she did. After all, no one brews a more delicious tea than you do, Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Let's have a party to celebrate! And Mr Reaper, you simply must come, too!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Wha... Erm... I'm, I'm afraid I couldn't...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>The Reaper of the Bailey, flustered by a ten-year-old girl...again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">No! Really?! Oh pooh...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But...I give you my word... ...that I shall present myself at your residence in the near future to express my gratitude.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh how lovely...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You've promised now. I won't let you forget! ...Bye for now, then!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright, Iris. Thank you for all your help earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, that was nothing. Just come back home soon!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">OOOUUUCH! <thought>Uuugh... One final pinch goodbye, was it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Well, I think I ought to be leaving. Lord van Zieks, would you care to accompany me?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Certainly. Mr Naruhodo, allow me once again to express my deep gratitude to you. I believe...you saved my life.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait, Lord van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um... What are you intending to do now?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Well clearly, I shall have to resign from the Prosecutor's Office.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh no!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I intend to publicise the full truth about the Professor case. Once that's done, the van Zieks family will be ostracised completely from London society.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Surely not...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So as soon as I am free from my employment, I shall leave the capital.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...I see...</line>
<line speaker="???">Don't be a fool.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Are those the actions of a man once feared as the mighty Reaper of the Bailey?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">For the past ten years, you've endured that pseudonym and been cast as one of the dark forces yourself. Now that you've finally been freed from that disrepute, your battle is just beginning, surely?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Well...I certainly never expected to hear those words from your lips.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I waited a very long time to come to London. Now I'm properly here, I intend to learn all that I can. Anyway, goodbye for now... Ryunosuke Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma Asogi... It seems as though he's really matured suddenly.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He's not the only one who's matured, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, I think we should make our way back to Baker Street. We must help Iris with tonight's dinner!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We must!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm home! Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">'Bout time you got 'ere! We've been waitin' ages, 'Oddo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">W-What are you doing with that...colourful piece of history?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">It's a party, innit? It's gotta go off wiv a bang! I mean fireworks, ideally. But when you ain't got fire, smoke's the next best thing, ain't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's a girl on Fresno Street who could help you with that, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Right...I'll remember that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You don't have to reload that thing every time I speak...</line>
<line speaker="???">You really must hear this! It's quite the most extraordinary thing!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I assure you, it will defy your expectations! Take down every detail now, Mikotoba.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Ah, the world-famous great detective, regaling his partner with the tale of his adventure... A sight to behold!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Would you care to hazard a guess? Where do you suppose the fiendish runaway had concealed himself? Would you believe...inside the trunk I found abandoned in his cabin?!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">......... I would believe it, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I say, Mikotoba...I detect not a hint of surprise.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I wonder why that is, hm? Maybe because I was there at the scene as well, Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What?! You were?! Then why the deuce didn't you say so before?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Not quite the sight I was expecting to behold, but still... ...it's hard not to feel privileged to see it.</thought> Hello, Mr Sholmes! Professor Mikotoba. I'm finally back from the Bailey.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And not a moment too soon! A feast prepared by Iris and Miss Susato awaits!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I must say, I haven't seen Susato looking so happy in a very long time.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah, Runo! There you are!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Dinner is on the table, everyone. Please, do come and take a seat!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Time to fill me boots!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Goodness! Is that really true, Gina?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yup! I'm losin' me copper's clobber an' goin' back to wot I know best! It's a diver's life for me!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You're really leaving the police force? But why, Ginny?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Well...the boss ain't around no more, so...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">An' anyway, no matter 'ow 'ard I try... ...that Reaper ain't never gonna accept a diver-turned-dick, is 'e?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well...people can change, you know...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah yes, that reminds me... ...I rather thoughtfully offered to relieve the bailiff of this now-defunct piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's...the inspector's pocket watch! <thought>And the crown has been reattached.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">That watch was his pride and joy. A symbol of his great achievements at Scotland Yard. For ten years without fail, it measured every second of the man's remarkable career.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But now...it's stopped...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Someone needs to keep the memory of Inspector Gregson's career alive... ...by taking on the great responsibility of winding that watch every single day again.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, someone with an equally fierce detective's spirit!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... It's gotta be me! There ain't no one else!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Quite right...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I mean, after all, the boss was... Well, 'e was MY boss.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, Ginny! Yes he was!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Oh yeah, and I made you a promise an' all, didn't I, Iris? That I'd become a proper detective one day an' track down yer old man.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Alright then, it's decided! I'll do it! An' I swear... ...I'll find yer dad an' bring 'im in kickin' an' screamin'!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I'm...not entirely sure that would be appropriate.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I think, Gina...it might be best to, well...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I think I'd like you to forget that promise, Ginny.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, obviously I've always wondered about who my real daddy is. Of course I have. I wanted to know where I've come from. I thought it might tell me something about myself. But I've caused such a lot of trouble trying to find out. For so many people. Hurley, Runo, Professor Mickey...</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Oh no, not at all, my dear! Really, you owe no apology to anyone...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well anyway, I've decided to give up on it. Because I've finally realised: My daddy...is the greatest in the world! I don't think it matters what his name is or where he's from. Don't you agree? Hurley?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... With every word, Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Thank you, Hurley. ...Thank you, Daddy.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... I think, Mikotoba...</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Yes, Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I think that I ought to express my gratitude to you.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">For six years, you and I solved many a mystery together. And during that time, I remember countless expressions of gratitude for our good services. But a moment ago, I heard the most pleasing expression of gratitude of them all. And I should never have experienced it...were it not for you.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">You old softy, Sholmes... But I must confess, it's a weight off my mind to hear you say it.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well then! I think this calls for a lengthy violin recital, wouldn't you say?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, well...the food would go cold, that's the only problem. Maybe next week, Hurley?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Are you sure a week is long enough, Iris? Ah ha ha ha ha hah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>This attic room has been my home and office for almost a year now. I've certainly had some unforgettable experiences whilst I've lived here. But I think now...the time has come. Time to bid this place farewell.</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Professor!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Are you alone? I didn't hear any sound from Susato's room.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, Susato-san went out after dinner. She took a carriage. Something about an important matter she needed to take care of.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Ah...I see. ......... I wanted to thank you for what you did earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">With Iris, I mean. When the subject of her father came up.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Lord Klint van Zieks...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I made up my mind many years ago never to tell her who her real father was. It's what was agreed with Genshin after all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Lord Klint van Zieks's final wishes before he died, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Yes. I've had to take some rather drastic steps at times to protect that secret, you know. ...Calling Susato back to Japan six months ago, for example.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! <thought>That's why?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">When I read Soseki-san's report about his final days in London, my heart nearly stopped. You'd stumbled across the crux of that terrible case: the dog's collar. The description of the Baskerville insignia left me in no doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Baskerville...</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">If you'd decided to investigate that insignia, sooner or later you'd have made the connection to the van Zieks. And to make matters worse, Susato knew of the unpublished story as well. The story that Iris had written based on my notes from the time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah yes, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'...</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Exactly. It was a work of fiction, but based on the grim reality of a huge beast of a dog being used as a murder weapon. A dog with the Baskerville family emblem around its neck. Armed with those two clues, I feared you and Susato might arrive at the truth. So I invented that story about having collapsed to justify her leaving London and returning to Japan at once. All in aid of halting any investigations you and she might have been contemplating.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see... Something I've never understood... ...is why Susato-san came across that manuscript in Japan, though. You know, Iris's 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' story, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Sholmes sent it to me. That was before Susato left Japan. He was very troubled about what should be done about it, you see. I'd read it and carelessly left it on my desk. Which is where Susato came across it, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">It was the only case Sholmes and I ever pursued that I didn't record in meticulous detail. I was stunned when I discovered that young Iris had pieced together so much of it from my paltry notes. Sholmes and I discussed the matter, and decided that we couldn't allow the story's publication. At that point, I returned the manuscript by post to Sholmes for safekeeping.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...So you did all that to stop Iris from finding out the truth about her father...</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">That's right. Because Sholmes had told me how astute she'd become. ......... However, having witnessed events in court today, I must say my opinion has somewhat shifted.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I think at some point in the future, the time will come for Iris to know the truth. And when it does, well... I believe it will be for the best.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I think so, too. ......... Actually, Professor... ...I, I wanted to talk to you about something, too.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">......... Judging from that expression, I'd say you've come to a decision, have you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I have. I...will be returning with you to Japan.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Are you quite sure?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I'm really only here as a substitute for Kazuma. But he's here in Britain now, as originally intended. Locum Student Naruhodo doesn't really have a right to stay, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">...I see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Looking back now, when I first arrived here in February... ...my becoming a lawyer just seemed to be the way things turned out. With Kazuma, Susato-san and Mr Sholmes all gently pushing me in that direction. I spent the best part of a year immersed in this world, but always aware of a seed of doubt inside me. Until today. Standing in that courtroom earlier, all doubts vanished from my mind. I was totally focused. I was sure of my belief in my client, and I was sure I could see the trial through. And at the end of it, I finally realised. No one else chose the path for me. I chose it myself.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">The path of a defence lawyer, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, that's what I am now. That's what I'll be going back with you to Japan as. And that's the path I'll be following for the rest of my life.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Well, it sounds like you've made quite a resolution there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I have!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Very well, then. I must say, it's extremely welcome news. I shall make arrangements for your return first thing tomorrow. But I don't imagine we'll depart for a few days.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Not with the symposium having been cancelled now. Such a shame...</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Never mind. I'm sure there'll be other opportunities in the future. ...Well then, I'll bid you good night.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">S-Susato-san...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I...just wanted to let you know I'm back.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did you, um... ...hear what your father and I were discussing?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm sorry, I did, yes. I...couldn't help but...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! ...How much did you hear?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well... ...from the part about Iris's real father, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...In other words, from the beginning.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... So you've made up your mind. You'll return to Japan and continue working as a defence lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...yes. I'm, I'm sorry. I really should have consulted you about it. I did want to earlier this evening, actually. But you'd already gone out.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh no, that's quite alright. I already knew that it's what you'd decide, Naruhodo-san.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You did?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Um...Susato-san...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah! ...Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose this means it...has to be farewell soon.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I suppose...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You'll be a great help to Kazuma going forward. I mean, I know he's a brilliant lawyer, but he's new to the British courtroom. He'll certainly benefit greatly having a brilliant judicial assistant at his side.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I'll do my very best.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... <thought>I wish I could say it, but I just can't. I can't ask her to come with me. After all... ...she was always supposed to be coming to Britain as Kazuma's assistant.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Susato">...It's growing late. We should both try to get some sleep. I'm sure you must be exhausted after today.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, yes...you're right.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Before I retire, let me just say one more time: You really were quite splendid in court today. So if you ask me... ...anyone who thinks of you as a substitute or a locum should be ashamed of themselves!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Susato-san... ...Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>I can't believe this day's finally come...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Iris">...You're really leaving then, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm afraid so, Iris. Thank you so much for everything. I don't know what I'll do without your wonderful cooking and delicious tea.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh...I wish you weren't going... But, but you have to come back and visit! Say you will!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of course. ...I promise.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">Well, it was a very brief reunion, but... ...it was a pleasure to pursue a case with you again after so long. For a while at least, it felt like old times.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, I...suppose on reflection... ...there's something to be said for it. Having a little fun once in a while.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I'll just go and say goodbye to the professor as well, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright, Iris, you do that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Susato-san...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I've just checked, Naruhodo-san. Your luggage is already on board. Such a beautiful morning. Perfect for embarking on a journey, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Before I set off...I'd just like to say how thankful I am for everything you've done for me. And give my warmest regards to Kazuma, please.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Actually...I think you ought to give him your regards in person, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Ryunosuke...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma! Wh-What are you doing here?!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Ha ha ha ha hah! Do you really think I'd miss my best friend's departure?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Thanks. To be honest, I'd been looking forward to our wild time tearing up the streets of Her Majesty's capital, but...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Mm. Well...we'll have to save that for another time. Personally, I'm looking forward to facing you in court again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Me too. ...But...we're both defence lawyers so...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I'm going to become a prosecutor. I'll stay in Lord van Zieks's tutelage for the time being, but before long... ...I intend to be just as formidable as the Reaper himself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...I see.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Actually, Ryunosuke, I have a favour to ask.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Name it.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I'd like you...to take care of this for me for a while.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Karuma?! ...Why?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Because I've seen it now. I've seen what's inside me. The demon that reared its ugly head that day. It was only for the briefest of moments, the last time I came face to face with that inspector... ...but it was unmistakable. I wanted to kill him. I've always known there are demons that live inside people. And now I know there is one in me. The fact that it very nearly consumed me is something I'll carry with me until the end of my days... ...while I devote my life to fighting those whose demons have got the better of them... ...as a prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...that's what you've resolved to do, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Until I'm ready to face the demon with me - to slay it once and for all... ...I leave this in your care. If you'll take it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of course I will. I'll keep it by my side. Always.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Until we meet again, then. You have your path to follow, and I have mine.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Um...Naruhodo-san... ...the path you're going to follow from now on... I wonder...if I might follow it at your side. Un-Unless I'd be a burden?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...? I mean...I, I w-would very much like you to come with me! But, but aren't you...?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Hah hah ha ha ha hah! You're so predictable, Ryunosuke!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I am?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Honestly, you never change at all! But that's what I like about you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You, you mean...you knew about this?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">It was the evening after Lord van Zieks's trial came to an end. She came to see me at the Prosecutor's Office.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? <thought>When I had that conversation with Professor Mikotoba...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">So you'd go with Ryunosuke back to Japan?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Yes. I know it's unfair of me to follow my own interests like this.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Coming here especially to tell me... You're a stickler for etiquette, aren't you? Well...what are his feelings?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We've never discussed it, of course. And Naruhodo-san has made no such suggestion. I worry that perhaps I'd be a burden to him.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">He's just as much of a stickler for etiquette as you are. He'd never say anything before he was asked. But I'd feel happy knowing you were with him. ...Look out for him on my behalf, will you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Of course!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Susato-san...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">W-What do you think, Naruhodo-san?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">With you by my side... no trial would seem too daunting. So if you're willing, I'd be honoured if you'd come with me. Together we can take on the world!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm terribly incompetent, but if you'll have me, I'd be delighted!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...n-no, not at all! If anyone's terribly incompetent, it's me! Aaagh!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What's wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Your luggage, Susato-san! There's no time! The ship's going to set sail any minute now!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Aah... It's alright, there's no need to worry. As it happens, my luggage is...already on board, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It is...?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Ah hah hah hah hah hah! Your fine judicial assistant has everything in hand as always, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ruuunooo! Your ship's about to leave!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Time to go then. Look after yourself, Ryunosuke.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma...draw your sword.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">One day...when our paths cross once more... ...we'll fight a duel. A duel of words, across the courtroom. A day I eagerly await...as a lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">......... I've been waiting to hear you say that...partner!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Don't forget me then, Kazuma.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">As if I could...Ryunosuke!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And Mr Sholmes...thank you so much. I'm very much indebted to you.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed, Mr Naruhodo, I believe you are.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'll never forget all you've done for me during my time in London.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Quite. I should like to think you will remember your debt of gratitude... ...especially when I visit you in your country.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The truth is, although many are ignorant of the fact... ...the world is far smaller than most folk realise.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...I'd be delighted if you came to Japan one day!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes! We'd welcome you with open arms, Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oooh, that sounds wonderful! I can't wait!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">In that case, let us conclude that this is to be merely a brief parting, my dear fellows!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And that brings us to the end of my adventures in Great Britain. A peculiar twist of fate brought me halfway around the world those many months ago. But that was just the start of my journey. Who knows where fate will lead me next? Still, I'm confident this won't be my last meeting with the friends I've made in London. And when we're together again... ...no doubt the first words I'll hear will be...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">'We have but to gently close our eyes, and we are with our companions once more.' ...So I do just that. And when I do...I can hear his, strong familiar voice ring out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Iris">Until we meet again, Runo!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I've been thoroughly inundated with enquiries about my Remote Cinematograph since that day. But I'm no purveyor of electrical goods! And what of the promised closed court secrecy? Anyway, I've decided an absence from London is in order. A sojourn in distant climes. The Empire of Japan, perhaps... I understand that 'wardrobe class' incurs no charge whatsoever.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I gave a little note to Hurley the other day. It just said, 'Thank you for everything, Daddy.' But it made Hurley cry... And I gave him some lotion I'd invented as well. To dye his hair red safely. But he said that might make him cry, too, so he'd rather not use it...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In those days, when I was known as the Reaper, I felt your presence at my side. Once, unable to bear the burden of that grim pseudonym, I even retired from the courtroom. Despite everything, I still wear your prosecutor's badge with pride. But the darkness that once beset me is no more. As you, too...are no more. In the words of a young foreign friend of mine: I must stride forward...toward a brighter future.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">The boss left a note for me, ya know. An' I can read every letter now. A to Z, the 'ole lot! It's cleared a load o' stuff up. The boss was...tryin' to protect me, see. An' that's exactly wot me an' Chief Inspector Toby 'ere are gonna keep doin' for Londoners! ...I only wish I could o' said 'ow grateful I was before 'e... ya know.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Gina... The truth is, I'm not the upstandin' fellow you think I am. You might be a diver at heart, but it's a good heart. You've reminded me I need to be true to myself. I've got one more job to take care of before it's ta-ta to London town for the foreseeable. And then I've gotta complete your education in the art of detection 'à la' Gregson, as they say.</line>
<line speaker="Auchi">Your Excellency, this man is accused of illegal entry into the office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs!</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Soseki"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn> Oblique Overstatement! Overruled! The minister has been detained in Britain anyway!</line>
<line speaker="Auchi">Who is this cattish counsel for the defence?! And women are forbidden to enter the courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Rei">Oh really?! My friend Susato-san is in the British courtroom all the time...and doing a wonderful job!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">...Perhaps I should have engaged the services of a regular legal team...</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">Mama, is it true about Japanese people? Are they experts at filleting corpses?</line>
<line speaker="Sithe">Yes, they are. ...Fish corpses, on the whole.</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">I'd like to hone my own filleting skills. You don't mind, do you, Mama?</line>
<line speaker="Sithe">Yes, I do. I'm not a corpse yet, am I?</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">......... No. And I'm glad.</line>
<line speaker="Harebrayne">Here I am again in Great Britain on the invitation of my dear old university friend! He sent me a very nice letter saying he'd like to show me around now that everything was settled. B-But what have I done?! I was so excited, I picked this splendid hotel, and now I can't afford the bill! Oh Barok! Come to my rescue again, please! I, I wish I could just vanish into thin air sometimes!</line>
<line speaker="Tusspells">When I went to make the waxwork impression of the killer in the cemetery, I realised what had happened. But even in the witness stand of the highest court in the land, I could never speak of it. The Lord Chief Justice and I had struck a bargain, you see. For a faithful reproduction of the visage, there is nothing we Tusspells would not do.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Hehe, everyone calls me Gossip. I sell jaunty little titbits to passers-by, you know.</line>
<line speaker="De Rossi">Hehe, everyone calls me-a Peppino! And I sell-a the spaghetti. It's more red-a than my head-a!</line>
<line speaker="De Rousseau">Hehe, everyone, zey call me... Non. Non, I cannot do it. Zis is ridiculous.</line>
<line speaker="Evie">Oh, Daley, how...charming. You've made lots of new friends here, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">Yes, and when we're released, we're all going to strike it rich together!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">When I was accepted on the foreign study tour, I knew exactly what path I had to take. And however it might have ended, I knew that I wanted you there to see it. If I'd ended up in the dock, there's no one I would have rather had defending me. But now, thanks to you...there's a new path I want to take. I'm sure we'll meet again in the courtroom, my friend. Until then...I leave Karuma in your care.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I've made some tea, Naruhodo-san. It's important that you rest whilst you can. Once we arrive in Japan, you shall be busy establishing your new office. I'm so delighted to be accompanying you. After all, your talents have been recognised by a great detective! Because you really are the greatest of lawyers! A 'great ace attorney', some might say!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I can't find anything out of place.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The witness's last statement...exhibits a fundamental inconsistency!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Not one that any British court would recognise, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...?!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Remember, this is a closed court. Whatever fate befalls you in here, no one outside will ever know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Should I be wondering if I'll make it out of this courtroom alive?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord! As counsel for the defence, I must object to that last statement!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">And as the judge, I must deny your objection. There is no contradiction here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">No contradiction, other than the fact that a Far Eastern lawyer is practising in a British courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Put there by a not-so-far away Lord Chief Justice, if you remember.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That last statement...seemed a little questionable to me. What do you think, My Lord?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">I see no inconsistency there. ...Do you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">You could span the Straits of Dover with those wide eyes, Counsel. And be gone from this island forever, I hope.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>Do you want me to fill the English Channel with tears?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is something wrong, Dr Gorey?</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did the last statement give you pause for thought, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">...Well, something did just come to mind. If you Easterners come from the other side of the world, are your internal organs all flipped?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">I'm desperate to look.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Strictly speaking, that's not really related to the testimony, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Gorey">Ready for the first incision?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">NO!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Professor Mikotoba!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">......... Yeees? What can I do for you, Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did something about that last statement bother you in some way?</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">I feel as though it might have done, as it happens. But you startled me so much, I've clean forgotten what I was thinking.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Perhaps try to remember for next time, then.</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">And perhaps you could try to remember not to holler next time, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Lord van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Let me guess: is there something about the witness's last statement that troubles me? Is that what you wish to ask?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Y-Yes... Exactly... You're very perceptive.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Whereas you...would appear not to be.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You really need to learn how to read your fellow man... my Nipponese friend.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><thought>...Read them...or 'reap' them?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Something on your mind, Governor Caidin?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It looked as though you were lost in thought there for a moment.</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">Och, I cannae relax when I'm no at the prison, do ya ken? I'm all het up worryin' aboot inmates escapin'...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I thought that Barclay was the most secure prison in all of Britain?</line>
<line speaker="Caidin">A-Aye, that's right, it is! I'm...sure I dinnae ought worry...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well in that case, do you think perhaps you could concentrate on the testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Vigil! Is something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh no! You, you haven't lost your memory again, have you?</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">No no, not at all. I was merely in a brown study.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You can think about how you want to decorate your house later. For now, please focus on the testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Vigil">So sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">We've wasted enough time! It's clear to me that any further discussion of this case will be fruitless. Barok van Zieks, I would like to think that however misguided... ...you acted out of a sense of justice nonetheless. Though it pains me to have reached this conclusion...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! Wait, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">In accordance with the findings of this court, I hereby pronounce the defendant, Barok van Zieks...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">That concludes business. Court is adjourned!</line>
