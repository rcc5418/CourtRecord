Episode 1The Foreign Turnabout
Here in Khura'in, death is not the end. Even after death, the soul lives on in the Twilight Realm... and priestesses can commune with the spirits of the dead. Fear not death. In the name of the Holy Mother... fear only impurities of your soul.
???:
This blight on my soul... I'll have the child take the blame...
Phoenix:
(My name is Phoenix Wright, and I run a small law office. Well, that's what I do back home, anyway. Right now, I'm just a traveler; a stranger in a strange land. This is the Kingdom of Khura'in -- a land of spirit mediums and mystery. I was going to take it easy, maybe take in a few sights, until... my cheery guide, Ahlbi Ur'gaid... was suddenly arrested for murder. I couldn't just leave him to his fate... so I took up his defense. Little did I know just how foreign this country's court system would be. Talk about culture shock...)
April 24, 10:24 AMKingdom of Khura'in
Judge:
O foreign lawyer... Let me make this crystal clear to you. We have no need for defense attorneys here in the Kingdom of Khura'in. All of our verdicts are guided by our royal priestess, Her Benevolence, Princess Rayfa. Her Divination Séances determine all.
Phoenix:
(But I can't just let a verdict be handed down with nobody standing in Ahlbi's corner!) If Ahlbi doesn't have a defense attorney, then I'll do it -- I'll be his attorney!
Judge:
Very well. It is a little unorthodox, but I will allow it. Though I hope you are prepared for the consequences as well.
Payne:
Heh heh heh. Mr. Phoenix Wright. To think you would dare go against Her Benevolence and me, Gaspen Payne -- I see you are as foolhardy as ever. Hee hee hee hee hee. No matter. You will learn the hard way what it means to defend someone in this country.
Phoenix:
(Uh... Have we met before...? Or are you confusing me with someone else? ...Not that now's the time for that. I gotta say, it sounds like one tough crowd out there...)
Gallery:
Just you watch! That defense attorney will try and twist the truth! You can bet on it! Get him, Prosecutor Payne! Crush that defense devil!
Phoenix:
(Why in the world do they hate lawyers so much here?)
Judge:
Now, if you would please give your opening argument once again, Mr. Payne.
Payne:
Certainly, Your Magistry. The accused is charged with two crimes: larceny... and murder. Yesterday, the national treasure known as the Founder's Orb... was stolen from the treasure room of Tehm'pul Temple. But that's not all. Along with the empty treasure box... was the dead body of Mr. Paht Rohl, a temple security guard. We believe he was murdered by the thief who stole the treasure. Please allow me to submit as evidence the victim's autopsy report and crime photo.
Rohl's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Crime Photo added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I should be able to check out the evidence by looking in the Court Record (R). I'd better take a good look at it all later.) And what was the weapon used in this heinous act, Mr. Payne?
Payne:
The victim was bludgeoned to death with the treasure box itself. As you can see here, it's covered in blood. Since you seem to be shamelessly uninformed, allow me to share this newspaper article.
Judge:
Oh! That's the article containing the only public photos of the box in existence.
Payne:
Indeed. It's forbidden for anyone outside of the royal family to view the treasure itself. Which is what makes these photos so special.
Phoenix:
(I guess there are national treasures that are off-limits to the public back home, too.)
Treasure Box added to the Court Record.
Payne:
Your Magistry, the prosecution would like to call the accused as our first witness.
Judge:
Very well. Accused, you will take the stand.
Payne:
Accused, state your name and occupation again, if you would.
Ahlbi:
Ahlbi Ur'gaid, sir.. I'm in training to be a monk... and I'm a tour guide, too.
Phoenix:
Don't worry, Ahlbi. I'm here to defend you.
Ahlbi:
Mr. Wright... I didn't know you were a lawyer... You... You tricked me!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ahlbi:
If I knew you were a lawyer, I wouldn't have given you that tour!
Phoenix:
A-Ahlbi, what's gotten into you?
Ahlbi:
Don't talk to me! You... You disgust me!
Phoenix:
(Now even Ahlbi's against me? What's going on here?)
Payne:
Heh heh heh. This must be a new experience for you, Mr. Wright, being loathed by a client. Now, then, accused, please give this court your testimony. I want you to tell us what you were doing at the time of the crime.
Witness Testimony
-- The Accused's Account --
Ahlbi:
I didn't kill Mr. Rohl, and I didn't steal the treasure.
I'm not allowed to go anywhere near the treasure room.
I've never even seen that treasure box with the green Khura'inese butterfly on it!
Payne:
The incident occurred after the Dance of Devotion rite.
Phoenix:
"Dance of Devotion"?
Judge:
You mean you don't know?! The Dance of Devotion that is performed by Her Benevolence to the Song of Ceremony... It's only the must-see of any Khura'inese tour!
Phoenix:
"(That sour-faced girl from earlier? ...I can't see her dancing to ANYTHING, to be honest.)
Judge:
You disappoint me, defense. I expect you to study and memorize this lyrics sheet posthaste!
Song of Ceremony lyrics received at gavel-point.
Judge:
Now then, your cross-examination, please.
Phoenix:
"(Finally, something familiar in this foreign court. Hmm, should I refresh my memory on how cross-examinations work...?)
Yes
Phoenix:
(Okay, so the text in green represents Ahlbi's testimony. And I can progress through it by touching the right arrow. If I want to go back to a previous statement, I can do it by touching the left arrow. And if I find a suspicious-looking statement... I should touch "Present" (R) to open the Court Record. The Court Record contains all of the evidence and data pertinent to this case. So all I have to do is find something that contradicts Ahlbi's testimony... and Present (x) it to the court. But if nothing really sticks out... I can always Press (L) him for a little more info. All right, Phoenix. Time to take a good listen to Ahlbi's testimony!)
Leads to Cross-Examination
No
Phoenix:
(Nah, I'll just treat this like any trial back home.)
Leads to Cross-Examination
Cross-Examination
-- The Accused's Account --
Ahlbi:
I didn't kill Mr. Rohl, and I didn't steal the treasure.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I believe you didn't do either of those things, Ahlbi.
Ahlbi:
............ You do? But you're a lawyer. Of course you'd say that.
Phoenix:
Now, now. There's no need for that.
Payne:
But he's right. Lawyers always claim their client is innocent, even if they have to lie. Just like you're doing right now, accused.
Ahlbi:
D-Don't lump me in with that lawyer! I'm NOT lying! I didn't steal anything and I didn't kill anybody!
Ahlbi:
I'm not allowed to go anywhere near the treasure room.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You're not allowed to go near the treasure room? Why is that?
Ahlbi:
It's a rule of the temple. They keep a lot of important things in that room.
Judge:
Yes, like the Founder's Orb, in particular. Only the royal family may lay eyes on it. They say that anyone without spiritual power would instantly go blind.
Ahlbi:
I heard you wouldn't be blinded if you just looked at the outer treasure box. But I've never been anywhere near the treasure room. I'm too scared. You've gotta believe me...!
Ahlbi:
I've never even seen that treasure box with the green Khura'inese butterfly on it!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
A box with a butterfly on it?
Ahlbi:
Yeah. You can see it in that newspaper article. Look! See? There's a relief of the Khura'inese butterfly on the treasure box.
Phoenix:
(Oh, this design here carved on the back of the box. I see it now.)
Payne:
It's a sacred butterfly, said to carry the soul, or "mitamah," of the departed. Its wings form a loop that cradles the mitamah and carries it to the Twilight Realm.
Judge:
As you can see, there's even one depicted here behind me at the judge's bench.
Phoenix:
(Well, what do you know? There it is. ...Though it kinda looks like he's about to be carried off to the Twilight Realm himself.)
Present Treasure Box
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"(Oh, Ahlbi... Why would you lie to me...?)"
Phoenix:
(I certainly don't think Ahlbi committed murder. However...)
Ahlbi:
Don't talk to me. You... You disgust me!
Phoenix:
(...That outburst earlier makes me wonder if he'd willingly tell me the truth. I'd better compare his statements and the Court Record carefully. If I find an inconsistency, I can Present some evidence and maybe get him to open up.)
Phoenix:
(Oh, Ahlbi... Why would you lie to me...?) So, you say you've never laid eyes on the treasure box. Is that right?
Ahlbi:
That's right. It's forbidden, so I'd never do that.
Phoenix:
In that case... how did you know there was a green butterfly on it?
Ahlbi:
Oof!
Phoenix:
(Wait, did that bag just move on its own...?)
Ahlbi:
I-I... I saw the picture of it... in that newspaper article.
Phoenix:
Nope. Take another look. These photos are in black and white. You couldn't possibly tell what color the butterfly is from these pictures!
Ahlbi:
Nngh... Ooh... Aaaaaaaaagh!
Phoenix:
(Wh-What the--?!)
Judge:
P-P-Pohlkunka! What is going on here?!
Shah'do:
Rrr... Ruff, ruff! Ruff, ruff!
Ahlbi:
I-I'm sorry about this. This is my dog, Shah'do.
Shah'do:
Ruff, ruff, ruff!
Phoenix:
(So that's what was making his bag move...)
Judge:
O Holy Mother. I thought my heart was about to stop for a second there. Oh, and for our foreign lawyer, "pohlkunka" is what we say when we're surprised.
Phoenix:
I-I see... (Well, that was rather surprising. I can't believe he explained that word to me. Is His Magistry secretly a language nerd...?)
Judge:
Still, if what you've discovered through your cross-examination is correct... then the accused has seen the murder weapon in person before. Which just makes him more suspicious than ever!
Phoenix:
(Which just makes things worse than ever...) Ahlbi. Please give only true statements. I can't help you if you don't tell the truth.
Ahlbi:
............
Shah'do:
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
Phoenix:
(Darn. I just can't seem to get him to open up to me. What in the world happened in this country... to make even a kid like Ahlbi hate lawyers so much?)
Judge:
As I suspected, this "cross-examination" session has served no purpose whatsoever. But armed as we are with Her Benevolence's Insight... there's no reason to doubt his guilt.
Phoenix:
Wait just one moment, Your Magistry! I haven't seen this Divination Séance for myself yet. As the defense, I have the right to check it!
Judge:
......Hmm... Very well. We will ask to have Her Benevolence perform the Divination Séance again. But, then, right after your tearful begs for mercy, I really do have to be going.
Phoenix:
(The only "tearful begs" are going to come from the prosecution when we're through!)
Rayfa:
............
Phoenix:
(There she is: "Her Benevolence"...)
Rayfa:
......Barb-headed attorney!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
Rayfa:
I am told you question the veracity of the sacred Divination Séance. Rest assured, you will soon see the error of your foolish ways!
Judge:
Now then, Your Benevolence. The Divination Séance, if you would.
Rayfa:
Certainly. Nayna, my robe... O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination Séance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!
(Incense, Song of Ceremony, Boy's voice, Boy's voice, Pain)
Phoenix:
(What just happened?! An image appeared in the pool!)
Judge:
A final message from the victim's soul, the last communication of his mitamah... The Divination Séance has revealed this to us.
Payne:
Her Benevolence can use her power of Spirit Communion... to project a victim's memories of the last few moments before their demise.
Phoenix:
(So what we saw in the pool is what Mr. Rohl actually experienced?!)
Payne:
In the victim's memories, we see the accused raising a weapon up over his head. This is consistent with the findings of the police investigation.
Phoenix:
(This looks bad for Ahlbi... Really, really bad...)
Rayfa:
You'll have plenty of time to regret your folly in the Twilight Realm. The souls of the departed speak only the truth, and I but give their messages a voice. If you think my Insights contain falsehood, I challenge you to prove it!
Insight
-- Rayfa's Insight --
Rayfa:
The accused swung whatever he was holding down on the victim's head!
With the pain, the victim's vision went dark. This is when he lost his life.
Still, I can't believe it -- a murder after the morning Dance of Devotion?
Rayfa:
These are the victim's experiences just before his death.
Phoenix:
(As the victim's final memories, we can assume they aren't lies. So how do I break this down?)
Rayfa:
Allow me to relieve you of your ignorance, defense. Did you notice the words that appeared in the Séance vision?
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, I did see words... like "Song of Ceremony" and "Incense.")
Rayfa:
The victim's final memories are not limited to sight alone. Sight, smell, taste, sound, touch -- all is laid bare in the Pool of Souls.
Phoenix:
So what Mr. Rohl experienced with his five senses appears in the vision as words, right?
Rayfa:
Precisely. And by examining these sensations... we can perceive the victim's final moments with unparalleled clarity.
Phoenix:
(Okay, so this vision shows what the victim was experiencing with his five senses... Wait a minute. Just before... Her Benevolence said "after the morning Dance of Devotion," didn't she? Isn't there something off about that?)
Phoenix:
(I'll use these arrows (D-Pad or Circle Pad) to select the Insight I think is off.
Still, I can't believe it -- a murder after the morning Dance of Devotion?
Phoenix:
(Yes, this is the Insight that sounded funny. Now I'll just carefully compare this Insight with the Séance vision. If I notice a sensation that seems contradictory, I'll tap "Select" (X)!)
Select after "Song of Ceremony" appears
Leads to:
"(This is it -- this is the part of the vision that contradicts the Insight.)"
Select any other time
Phoenix:
(Hmm... This part of the vision doesn't seem to really contradict the Insight. I'd better tap "Select" (X) at some other point in the vision!)
Phoenix:
(This is it -- this is the part of the vision that contradicts the Insight. Now I just select the sensation I think is inconsistent and then "Present" (X) it!)
Select "Song of Ceremony" (Sound)
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Wait just a moment!"
Select any other sensation
Phoenix:
(Wait... No, that's not it. This sensation isn't really inconsistent with the Insight. I'd better find the sensation that IS, and "Present" (X) that!)
Phoenix:
Wait just a moment!
Rayfa:
Yes? What is it, Barbed Head?
Phoenix:
You're saying the incident occurred AFTER the morning Dance of Devotion, right?
Rayfa:
That is right. What of it?
Phoenix:
Then isn't it strange that Mr. Rohl could still hear the Song of Ceremony?
Judge:
Oh, my! You're absolutely right!
Rayfa:
That's enough!
Rayfa:
Hmph. Is that all that troubles you?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Rayfa:
What the victim heard was just a practice run of the Song of Ceremony.
Phoenix:
Practice run? What are you talking about?
Rayfa:
Mr. Payne, if you would?
Payne:
Certainly! The incident occurred in the interval between the morning performance... during which time, the song's singers were practicing in the performance hall.
Rayfa:
Precisely! I was there as well, so I can corroborate this statement.
Judge:
I see. So what the victim hears was that practice session.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. There goes my contradiction...)
Judge:
A most exquisite rebuttal, Your Benevolence. Now, if you wouldn't mind, could you please revise your Insight for us?
Rayfa:
Very well.
Insight Revised
Still, I can't believe it -- a murder after the morning Dance of Devotion?
The Song of Ceremony the victim heard was of a practice run.
Phoenix:
(I think I'm getting the hang of this. If I point out an inconsistency, she'll update her Insights accordingly. So if I keep pointing things out, maybe I can knock all of her Insights out after all! I'd better find another inconsistency, no matter how small!)
Phoenix:
(Hmm... It's a bit hard to focus on the Insights with the Séance vision going. I'll try using the "Pause" button (L) to temporarily stop the vision. There! I paused the vision! I think I can touch the flashing panels (Y/A) to jump to different parts of the vision. I'll try moving the mitamah mark to the flashing red panel there. Okay, now that I know how to get around in Séance visions... it's time to find inconsistencies between the Insight and the vision!)
The accused swung whatever he was holding down on the victim's head!
With the pain, the victim's vision went dark. That is when he lost his life.
Select the Pain (Touch) / Select the Darkness (Sight) before Pain appears at the fifth panel.
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"You're saying the victim's field of vision went dark right after he was struck, correct?"
The Song of Ceremony the victim heard was of a practice run.
Phoenix:
You're saying the victim's field of vision went dark right after he was struck, correct?
Rayfa:
Of course, as anyone with eyes can see.
Phoenix:
Well, pardon me, but... I must disagree.
Rayfa:
What?
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence, please take another look at the exact moment the victim felt pain.
Rayfa:
Hm...? ......Oh!
Phoenix:
Everything goes black and then -- only after that -- the victim feels pain.
Rayfa:
I-Inconceivable!
Phoenix:
This places the order of events at odds with what you say happened!
Rayfa:
P-P-P... Pohlkunka!
Judge:
Your Benevolence! What is the meaning of this?
Rayfa:
I c-cannot be wrong! My Insights are beyond fallacy!
Judge:
If what the defense says is true, this is a very grave matter indeed! I'm afraid this contradiction... is something we simply can't ignore!
Phoenix:
(All right! I crushed that Insight! Even if I have to fight every person in this country... I swear I'll get Ahlbi acquitted of this crime... in the main game!)
Present wrong evidence on wrong statement during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
There's something odd about the witness's statement. And this is the evidence that will prove it!
Judge:
No... The only thing "odd" I find here... is your objection. I hope this will help you change your ways.
Phoenix:
(That didn't go very well... Actually... I guess I wasn't even remotely close on that one... I'd better take another good look at Ahlbi's statements and the evidence...)
Present wrong evidence in correct statement during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The witness's statement clearly contradicts this piece of evidence, Your Magistry!
Judge:
You're laying your life on the line on THAT...? And what exactly about the testimony is inconsistent with that?
Phoenix:
...... (Urk. Suddenly, I'm not so sure...) I apologize, Your Magistry. May I try again?
Judge:
By all means... But know this: You just drove a nail into your own coffin!
Phoenix:
(Gaaaaagh... But I just KNOW something's off about this statement. Guess I should search the Court Record again for something that contradicts it.)
Present correct evidence in wrong statement during testimony
Phoenix:
Judge:
........... I don't see any particular problems with this piece of evidence.
Phoenix:
(Whoops! Guess that's not it...)
Judge:
More of your defense attorney shenanigans, is it? Well, I won't stand for it. In the name of the Holy Mother, I give you a penalty!
Phoenix:
...Urk! (I'm SURE this is the piece of evidence I need, though. I guess I'd better take another look at Ahlbi's statements...)
Present incorrect sensation on incorrect Insight during Divination Séance
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
There's an inconsistency between this Insight and the victim's memories!
Rayfa:
An inconsistency, you say? And where exactly do you see this supposed "inconsistency"?
Judge:
Yes, defense, please be specific.
Phoenix:
Well, I don't know how specific I can be, exactly, but... I just get the vague feeling that something doesn't quite add up... you know?
Judge:
No, I don't know. But I DO know you're skating on thin ice, defense. By your leave, You're Benevolence...?
Rayfa:
...Do it.
Judge:
Penalty!
Phoenix:
Nngh... (And here I thought I was skating so gracefully on that ice, too... I get the feeling I was way off the mark with that one... I'd better take another good look at the Insights and the sensations... I doubt there are any mistakes in the victim's last memories... So that must mean one of Her Benevolence's Insights is off! I'll use these buttons (D-Pad or Circle Pad) to cycle through the Insights and check each one carefully. And then I'll compare the Insights with the sensations and look for an inconsistency!)

Rayfa:
...Do it.
Judge:
Penalty!
Phoenix:
Nngh... (And here I thought I was skating so gracefully on that ice, too... I'm feeling pretty confident I got the right sensation. I guess I'd better take another look at which Insight to present... I'll use (D-Pad or Circle Pad) to cycle through the Insights... and try to find the Insight that's inconsistent with this sensation!)

I'd better check the victim's last memories carefully from beginning to end... and look for a sensation that's inconsistent with this Insight!)
Consultation (Cross-Examination)
Phoenix:
(Argh! I could really use a partner to consult with right about now...)
Payne:
Heh heh. You seem to be having a hard time. Can't do anything without your little friends? It's so sad when the mind starts to go...
Phoenix:
("Can't do anything without--"?! I'll show you who's got the sharper mind yet! Get your head back in it, Phoenix! You can do this! If I think back on everything I've heard... Yes, that one statement is definitely fishy!)
Consultation (Divination Séance)
Phoenix:
(Argh! I can't seem to find any inconsistencies... But something's been nagging at me. I think it has something to do with the sensation of pain... Although, I shouldn't overlook the moment the victim was struck either. I think I'll take another look at the Insights with those things in mind.)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims. This court finds the accused, Ahlbi Ur'gaid...
Guilty
