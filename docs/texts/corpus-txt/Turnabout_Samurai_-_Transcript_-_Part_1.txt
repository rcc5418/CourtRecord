Grrah! You have disgraced me for the last time, Steel Samurai! The pale moon in the sky cries for your blood!
The moon? No, it is you who should gaze upon the moon... For it will be the last moon you ever see! See you in hell, Evil Magistrate! Whoooooooaaaaaaa!
Grrrrrraaaaaaaah!
The warriors' swords gleam and strike in the moonlight! One has fallen... but who? Only the moon knows! Don't miss next week's exciting episode: "The Dark Messenger Returns!"

Maya:
That rocked! "See you in Hell, Evil Magistrate!!!"
Phoenix:
Whoa! Stop waving that broom around!
Maya:
Oh, Nick! I didn't know you were here!
Phoenix:
Of course I'm here! What was that surreal show you were watching?
Maya:
What!? Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people!
Phoenix:
Young...? Like, how young?
Maya:
Umm... 10 years old?
Phoenix:
Then what the heck are YOU doing getting all excited!?
Maya:
Hey! I'm only 17! That's seven-"teen." See? I'm a teen! Not like you, Nick.
Phoenix:
Hey! Don't talk to me like I'm your grandpa or something. I'm only 24 myself.
Maya:
Then watch it with me!  He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, "Steel Samurai" was no.1!
Phoenix:
I really worry about kids these days.
Maya:
Gramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office.
Phoenix:
I guess... Wish we had some clients!
Phoenix:
A month has passed since my trial. Mia's murder was the talk of the town for some time... But no one paid any attention to the Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices... How am I going to pay the rent this month?
Maya:
It'll be okay. I'm sure some big client is just around the corner!
Phoenix:
Hmph.

I-it's the Steel Samurai! The Steel Samurai got arrested!
Phoenix:
Huh? You mean the guy on that show?
Maya:
Yes! They're saying that the Steel Samurai killed a villain!
Phoenix:
... Umm... Isn't that what he's supposed to do?
Maya:
Yeah, on TV!
Phoenix:
Yeah, on TV.
Maya:
No! I mean, he actually did it! In real life! He skewered a villain with his Samurai Spear!
Phoenix:
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
Maya:
Just come to the office, quick! Please, Nick!

(Maya's here... watching television.)
TV:
Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo." He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the "Evil Magistrate." His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The "Samurai Spear" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.
Phoenix:
... This has to be a joke.
Maya:
No, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over!
Cellular:

Cellular:

Maya:
Let's go, Nick!
Phoenix:
Go? Go where?
Maya:
They have the Steel Samurai down in detention!
Phoenix:
So what!?
Maya:
So, I've decided this will be our first case!
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.
Movie poster
Phoenix:
A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.
Phoenix's desk
Phoenix:
Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.
Window
Phoenix:
It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)
Any ideas
Maya:
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
No! We just don't have enough information!

Phoenix:
What's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh!
Maya:
Umm... Is that guy really him?
Phoenix:
Whaddya mean "that guy"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him.
Maya:
Um, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.
Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?
Will:
Umm...
Maya:
Y-yes!?
Will:
Something wrong...?
Maya:
N-no! No!
Phoenix:
(This is getting off to a great start.)
Will:
I know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?
Maya:
D-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.
Will:
No, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams.
Maya:
Oh...
Will:
I guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!
Maya:
Nick!
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
He's a good guy! I mean, he's good!
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Maya:
He didn't do it!

Security camera
Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.
Talk
What happened
Phoenix:
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Will:
Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Will:
Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.
The Steel Samurai
Phoenix:
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Maya:
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Phoenix:
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
Will:
No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!
Phoenix:
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)
Powers's alibi (appears after What happened)
Phoenix:
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
Will:
Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.
Phoenix:
(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)
Will:
What will the kids think? *sniff*

Anything else
Will:
I-I'm sorry. I'm sure that's very important and all. I just don't see what it has to do with my problem.
(Talking about "Powers's alibi" leads to:)
Phoenix:
I think I should probably check out the scene of the murder...
Will:
Right... Global Studios. I'll draw you a map.
Maya:
Wow! Nick! Let's go!

Sitting around here won't get us anywhere, that's for sure. The studio! We should go to the studio! I'm sure we could find some clues there!

Wow! So this is where they make the Steel Samurai show! Awesome! Aren't you excited!?
Oldbag:
Hey! You there! You want in, you gotta go through me!
Maya:
O-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers.
Oldbag:
Oh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.
Maya:
G-gawkers?
Oldbag:
Gawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...
Maya:
Umm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say "no."
Phoenix:
I dunno! It's possible.
Oldbag:
Hey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today!

Computer
Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.

Guard station
Phoenix:
The security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.

The studios
Phoenix:
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Oldbag:
At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...
Maya:
No! You were a star!?
Oldbag:
Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.
Maya:
Wo... wow.
Oldbag:
This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...
Phoenix:
Hammer...?
Oldbag:
The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...
Will Powers
Phoenix:
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Oldbag:
He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his "big chance." No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...
Maya:
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Oldbag:
Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.
Mr. Hammer (appears after The studios)
Phoenix:
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Oldbag:
What "kind of person"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!
Phoenix:
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Oldbag:
But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.
Reason for suspicion (appears after Will Powers)
Phoenix:
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Oldbag:
I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!
Phoenix:
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
Yes. I saw him!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.
Oldbag:
Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.

What's that? You giving that to me?
Phoenix:

(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Oldbag:
Isn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here. Move along.
Phoenix:
Um, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request.
Oldbag:
Hmph! I thought you were suspicious lookin'! Show me a "letter of request." And maybe I'll just let you in.
Maya:
This lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously.

Phoenix:
Right, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect.
Will:
*sniff*
Talk
Your alibi
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Will:
W-what? No! I'd never do that!
Phoenix:
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
Will:
Yes. Like a baby.
Phoenix:
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Will:
W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
Will:
I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?
Phoenix:
(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)
The security lady
Phoenix:
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Will:
Oh, the security lady?
Maya:
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Will:
Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. "Take off that mask!" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.
Maya:
Grr! She's got some nerve!
Present
Powers's Letter
Phoenix:
Thank you for the letter of request.
Will:
Show that to the security lady and she should let you in.
(Talking about "The security lady" leads to:)
Phoenix:
Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?
Will:
Of c-course.
Powers's Request added to the Court Record.

Ma'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers.

Hmm...? Yes, yes. I recognize the bold, childish scrawl.
Gave Powers's Request to the security lady.
Oldbag:
To think he would entrust his fate to youths of such unreliable appearance... Really!
Phoenix:
Really?
Oldbag:
Anyway, you may pass. But only left from here, toward the studios! No going to the right. That's the Employee Area. "No one allowed inside, pal" were my instructions. The good detective told me himself.
Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
There were maps in the security guard station.
Phoenix:
Hey! Not bad!

Those are 50 cents a piece,

Hey! Aren't you that murderer from the other day!
Maya:
Aah! It's that confused detective!
Gumshoe:
Hey pal, you know Prosecutor Edgeworth is all upset, and it's your fault! I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window!
Phoenix:
Umm... so?
Maya:
Hey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work!
Gumshoe:
!!! ... ... ...
Maya:
Um, Detective?
Phoenix:
I think you hurt his feelings.
Maya:
Oh no! I... I'm sorry!
Phoenix:
Well, I think his feelings are easily hurt.
Gumshoe:
You're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart!
Maya:
Hey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here?
Maya:
Um, well... We're on this case too, pal!
Gumshoe:
Huh!? Hey! You can't just go saying "pal" like that! That's MY endearing character trait!
Maya:
I'd say he's a character alright...
Examine
Bench
Phoenix:
I'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here.
Gumshoe:
Hey, good idea, pal!
Maya:
Detective! Aren't you on the case?
Gumshoe:
W-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!
Left path
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?
Gumshoe:
Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.
Mr. Monkey
Phoenix:
The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]
Maya:
What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.
Gumshoe:
Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.
Security camera
Phoenix:
Hey, there's a camera here.
Gumshoe:
That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!
Phoenix:
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.
Studio One entrance
Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!
Phoenix:
Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.
WELCOME sign
Maya:
There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.
Maya:
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?
Phoenix:
Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.
Gumshoe:
Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?
Talk
The investigation
Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.
Maya:
Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?
Phoenix:
Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?
Gumshoe:
What I got?
Phoenix:
The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...
Gumshoe:
Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
The investigation (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!
Phoenix:
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)
Reason for arrest
Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Gumshoe:
Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.
Maya:
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Phoenix:
Thanks for cheering me up...
The security lady
Phoenix:
About the security lady...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!
Phoenix:
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Gumshoe:
When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!
Maya:
Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.
Gumshoe:
She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!
Maya:
Whaat!?
Decisive evidence (appears after The security lady)
Phoenix:
What kind of evidence!?
Gumshoe:
Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!
Maya:
What! Who took that!?
Gumshoe:
See the camera up on that gate, pal?
Maya:
The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!
Maya:
Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!
Phoenix:
(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)
Gumshoe:
...
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!
Phoenix:
I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...
Maya:
Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.
Anything else
Phoenix:
Um, Detective. Any ideas about this?
Gumshoe:
Look, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?
(Talking about "The investigation" and "Decisive evidence" leads to:)
Gumshoe:
What's wrong, pal? You seem down.
Phoenix:
Don't look so happy when you say that.
Gumshoe:
Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh!
Maya:
Umm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...
Gumshoe:
Sure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!
Phoenix:
(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)
Maya:
Nick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!
Move
Studio - Main Gate
Leads to:
"Nick! Look!"
Maya:
Nick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!
Phoenix:
Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...
Oldbag:
Hey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?
Phoenix:
(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)
Talk
Photographic proof
Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.
Reason for suspicion
Oldbag:
This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!
Phoenix:
Maybe... it was you?
Oldbag:
Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.
Phoenix:
(She thinks I was joking.)
Mr. Hammer
Phoenix:
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
Oldbag:
Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!
Phoenix:
("Was"? Past tense?)
Maya:
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
Oldbag:
That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the "Evil Magistrate"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?
Automatic camera (appears after Photographic proof)
Phoenix:
About the security camera...
Oldbag:
Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.

Maya:
What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?
Phoenix:
Don't look at me! How should I know?
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
What do you think?
Maya:
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
Phoenix:
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.
Photographic proof
Phoenix:
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maya:
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?
Maya:
On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.
October 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Apparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.
Phoenix:
Hmm... right.
Gumshoe:
Look pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!
Phoenix:
I have to ask him about that photograph!
Maya:
Oh well. Let's try again later.
Examine
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.
October 16Global StudiosEmployee Area
Maya:
Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!
Examine (left side)
Bicycle
Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Maya:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Don't people cycle to get exercise!?
Drain grate
Phoenix:
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.
Maya:
Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.
Maya:
Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!
Lunch table
Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
Maya:
Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.
Phoenix:
(What!?)
Stage backdrop
Phoenix:
There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably "Neo Olde Tokyo Castle."
Examine (right side)
Dressing room door
Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?
Phoenix:
What do you mean "find"!?
Maya:
You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!
Phoenix:
We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)
Dressing room sign
Phoenix:
There's a sign on the dressing room door. "Mr. Will Powers"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.
Dressing room window
Phoenix:
A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.
Storage room door
Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.
Maya:
Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!
Phoenix:
Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio?
Vending machine
Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:
(Ladies first...)

Dressing Room
October 16Global StudiosDressing Room
Phoenix:
(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)
Maya:
No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?
Phoenix:
Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)
Examine
Cosmetics
Phoenix:
There's a vast array of cosmetics here.
Maya:
Ooh! This is the wig he used in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"! Nick! Try this on!
Phoenix:
No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)
Costume rack
Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.
Maya:
It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...
Phoenix:
(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)
Couch
Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...
Mirror
Phoenix:
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.
Powers's bag
Maya:
Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.
Phoenix:
Hey, don't open that.
Maya:
Look!
Phoenix:
An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says "Studio One."
Maya:
Let's take it, Nick!
Phoenix:
Borrow it. You mean borrow.
Cardkey added to the Court Record.
Powers's bag (subsequent times)
Maya:
I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?
Phoenix:
Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)
Table
Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Nick... I'm hungry!
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!
Phoenix:
(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)
Window
Phoenix:
It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.

Cardkey
Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Oh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over!
Phoenix:
W-wait! No, that's mine!
Oldbag:
Look, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died.
Phoenix:
W... well you'll just have to wait!
Outside Studio One
Examine
Studio One entrance
Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick!
Phoenix:
I wonder if this cardkey we borrowed from the dressing room will work...
*beep*
Phoenix:
It opened!
Maya:
Alright! We're in!

(She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.)

Hey, Detective! Take a look at this!

Maya:
Doesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real!
Phoenix:
Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...
Examine
Director's chair
Maya:
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Ready, Nick? Action!
Phoenix:
(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)
Film camera
Leads to:
"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!"
Reflecting screen
Maya:
What's this?
Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)
Stage backdrop
Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.
(Step)ladder
Maya:
Look, a ladder!
Phoenix:
That's a "step"-ladder.
Maya:
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Phoenix:
R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)
Tape outline
Phoenix:
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...
(Examining film camera leads to:)
Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!
Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!
Maya:
Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...
???:
Hey! You! No touching that!
Phoenix:
Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...
Maya:
"Y'know"!? No I don't know!
Phoenix:
Umm... who are you?
Penny:
Who me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera.
Maya:
We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.
Penny:
Oh, you're WP's people.
Maya:
"WP"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.
Penny:
I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.
Maya:
Don't worry, leave it to us!
Talk
The day of the crime
Phoenix:
Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
Penny:
Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.
Maya:
Only one assistant!?
Penny:
Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now. And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.
Maya:
I see. Neat!
Penny:
In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.
Phoenix:
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?
Penny:
Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.
Will Powers
Phoenix:
Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?
Penny:
No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?
Phoenix:
W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)
Sensing someone (appears after The day of the crime and Will Powers)
Phoenix:
So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?
Penny:
Yes... I think.
Phoenix:
("I think" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.)
Maya:
Nick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them!
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
Um, any thoughts about this?
Penny:
Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Maya:
What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Penny:
Umm... Sorry... I know you're busy.
Phoenix:
Not really.
Penny:
Actually, there's been something bothering me.
Maya:
Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!
Penny:
Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...
Phoenix:
You "sensed"?
Penny:
Yes, several times.
Phoenix:
Some other studio employees, maybe?
Penny:
No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.
Phoenix:
R-really!?
Maya:
But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?
Phoenix:
Yeah, you're right.
Penny:
I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.
Maya:
No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!

Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?
Oldbag:
Sure as can be!
Maya:
But we have a witness who thinks there was "someone from outside" here that day.
Oldbag:
What!?
Maya:
Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?
Oldbag:
...
Maya:
Ma'am?
Oldbag:
Who was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?
Maya:
Eek!
Oldbag:
Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?
Maya:
Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.
Oldbag:
Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!

She left...

Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!

The computer that runs the studio security cameras.

Phoenix:
Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)

Leads to:
"Okay. Let's give it a try."

Phoenix:
(Hmm... I'd better not fool around with this, or that security lady will get me. Maybe next time.)
Maya:
What? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring!
Phoenix:
Okay. Let's give it a try.
Maya:
You know how to work these things, Nick?
Phoenix:
Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)
[Please enter the number of the security camera.]
ST1-703
Phoenix:
There! Entered!
Maya:
... ... Nothing happened.
Phoenix:
Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong.
Maya:
*sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again?

Phoenix:
There! Entered! ...
Maya:
Hey! It printed out the data for that day!
Phoenix:
Let's see what we got... ... Huh?
Maya:
How is this a picture of Will Powers?
Phoenix:
Well, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him.
Maya:
I don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.
Phoenix:
Huh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]
Maya:
What does that mean?
Phoenix:
Maybe there's more photo data from that day?
Maya:
Nope--that's the only one in the computer.
Powers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record.
Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Maya:
We'll put that security lady in her place with this!
Phoenix:
Right, we'll put her in her place...
Maya:
Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!
Phoenix:
Wait. Let's not.
Maya:
Why not?
Phoenix:
It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.
Maya:
Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!
Phoenix:
Hey! Why do I have to be the villain.
Maya:
Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?
Phoenix:
I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
